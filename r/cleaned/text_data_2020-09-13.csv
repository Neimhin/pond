I know state parks nice campgrounds flushable toilets, usually multiple toilets per bathroom stalls sinks like normal public bathroom. mean numbers changed, altered, hidden show pre-pandemic levels.

There's difference general international image american, image american *tourist.* evidence show already Seeing cure point, best isolate symptoms subside. chances getting Covid wearing mask one else 30%. really depends cough sneeze near. Even chances 50/50. Keep wearing mask stay safe, friend! Unfortunately trial would potentially tarnish results individual could change normal behavior based test results  Schools reopened almost two weeks ago country (Belgium). I've following pediatric research understand risk fairly minimal young kids, measures place ensure adults minimize contact (here's hoping they'll respect them). secondary schools (12 18) reopened well. Students aged 12 wear mask lessons breaks. parents organizing sure government measures... want kids wear mask. understand wearing mask _all day long_ tough, certainly teenager. again... schools reopened first place?...
When mention research shows teenagers least much vectors virus adults, many cases even superspreaders, I'm sometimes told consensus there's many studies showing opposite, often case. searching web, particular Google scholar, actually find study contradicts me. amount research spreading among teenagers seems quite small though.
Can anyone point research? Lol. That’s funny. Germany/France/Spain

Weird choice group germany those. Well played know number apparently Covid-19 number one killer police US year. It’s easy deal sort situations, it’s simple figure it’s hard people.

It’s hard so, since it’s hard patient apparent “stupidity”, sometimes people look less deserving empathy ones need most. got downvoted lot truth Anyone thinking differently needs go room covid contamination without protection open window. you’re open maybe open window enough?

Do think risk cross-apartment air circulation? 

I've hearing upstairs neighbors cough non-stop I'm concerned chance reconcilation air apartment. guess would entitled assholes give difficulties normal times overrepresented group people refusing wear masks going like everything's fine. nice customers actually give fuck people either staying home getting takeout.

Kind like every car see double parking rolling coal random people always seem bumper sticker flag certain political candidate... would say it’s worrying. think justified? Could wrong tho technically hole ground, like they're moving bodies.

The welfare society supersedes individual liberty free speech. protecting welfare society, ultimately important human right protected, human right live.

I'm happy provide full answer: would honestly rather Beijing right anywhere UK (or US) right now. Obviously still risk, second wave breakout Xinfadi seafood market June, response incredibly swift. happened:

As soon news broke anyone contact place people originating Xinfadi contact traced, authorities also gave every district Beijing risk designation, high risk areas asked quarantine within homes, medium risk areas quarantined within areas, low risk areas could travel wished (but Beijing unless negative COVID swab), swab cost like 20-30$ remember correctly. Also, going public facility (shopping malls, restaurants, cinemas residential community - gated), mandatory display current health status (the contact tracing app updates real time high risk area), status ""green - low risk"", allowed in, also temperatures taken point well, anyone high temperature allowed in.

All measures well bedded society functions new normal, along everyone's carefulness wear masks (even though there's longer requirement people wear masks everywhere still), fact reported community transmission means cases coming borders much easier government control, means risk lower many places world.

Also, lot people Beijing covers quite large area land. population density based could find Google high might think (London = 4500 people/km2, Beijing = 6000 people/km2, New York = 10000 people/km2).  Hold high horses governor

I’m interacting close quarters dozens people every day. None wear masks, know large number frequently go big parties crowded bars. actually traveling around state maybe even bordering states. I’m one wears mask feels useless point.

Edit: forgot mention also large covid outbreak factory, they’re keeping quiet people don’t find out. honestly sad MSM diverting attention pandemic Sushant Singh's death Kangana's home.

Honestly care less topics.

I think people India aware bad Covid situation is, city. doubt care country's numbers are, I've seen. year? Lol. Normally Americans twice large bike support, probably helped. ""exponential function grows exponentially""  r/selfawarewolves Thank you. presence Reddit study share know, world. hope one day author book make difference. *shrug*

I live South Korea, I've seen plenty cases expats met Canadians tell Canadian American without told. really little difference accent people either side border (except obviously Quebec), get much difference areas away border. got contact 999 thought people hated US 13th Amendment abolished slavery involuntary servitude except as *punishment crime*. We're number one research development bc get FEDERAL grants so, go take publicly funded procedures medicine charge asshole it. socialized work privatized profit. literally first World country without form universal healthcare. country UH looking end bc successful. Healthcare profited of, period. worse health outcomes needs end.  people volunteer risk health lives sorts ways. say ""Saskatoon"" lot? read headline, assumed ""dig **their own** graves"". reading see dig others... equally tough sentences. 

I would definitely recommend conspiracy/non-beliver groups, sure shit honest way tell someone real, people dying. Break tinfoil hats everyone... Schools country opened back kids come ""shifts"".

The kids 30% filled classroom teacher online class presentation.

So in-class kids ""social interaction"" schooling dont thier laptops watching teacher look screen. 

Forgot mention, hear thier classmates online since teacher uses headsets.


Schools systems adapting fast enough. People would learn become experts cruel unusual punishment amendment sudden. ppl still parties time, literally cannot stand generation Moral reasons aside, probably prisons extremely vulnerable large outbreaks spread prison via corrections officers others interact prisoners. Reported vote manipulation.

 

Have fantastic night. seen doctor whole time. Explain don’t think that’s entire article. don’t consider doom gloomer. realistic. patients convinced we’re going vaccinated Christmas, won’t happen.

""The shipper utilize real-time temperature-monitoring devices, including GPS tracking technology, allow 24/7 in-transit control,"" Brian Gleeson, senior director Pfizer's global supply product portfolio management, said meeting convened Advisory Committee Immunization Practices Centers Disease Control Prevention.

Pfizer said statement supplies existing vaccines least 165 countries, adding, ""We confident capability deliver store doses destination's governments designate, according product shipping storage requirements.""

Yeah, doom. 

Could glitches? Sure, it’s new, learning curve trumps administration idiots. full disaster doom fetish movie much like you’re -continually- painting? Probably not. Funny I've seen comments reddit decrying prison labor exploitation years celebrate hopefully they’ll able move around world quickly. that’s case, cdc plan people come them, simply distribute widely? cdc call last week suggested wouldn’t sustainable supply awhile.

What’s storage temp season’s flu vaccine? Since cool statistics, tell China statistical anomaly comes covid stats? agree this. think one year mark pandemic (mid - March) strikingly free less fearful world. probably it'll obvious we're endgame. Hahaha oh you.

I don’t expect find actual study, isn’t one flu. whole point two aren’t comparable flu symptoms speak are:

1.	less prevalent
2.	less serious, relatively speaking

The risk heart attack due inflammation bad. That’s similarity share. Heart damage similar heart attack simply sick unique Covid. 

Now let’s ask ourselves, *really* can’t support they’re saying? provided research top medical journal. Show research found flu bad, said flu causes fatigue heart damage, said didn’t.

Oh since you’re totally arguing bad faith, point this. Minus part actually right, course. Yeah... Gonna need independent data that. Natural selection thing. can’t -as nation- ignore education long expect everything fine. Talk cruelty animals. bet feel really good lmfao like feline enteric coronavirus sometimes morphs lethal version—FIP? Like, many individuals exposed, get GI signs, mutates dangerous form individuals? Apparently ""wartime mode"" means ***voluntary*** testing. :v reliable updates China?  went see sbongebob kids, 8 people whole theater, wearing masks time 6 feet apart. Exactly. government ever cared Americans lives before? let us drink, use tobacco, drive, eat highly processed foods, go war oil.. higher death probability Sharona Cyrus Thank acknowledging educated response shows know wrong dumbass troll :) Yeah makes sense I’ve hospitals. I’ve seen people ICUs dying pneumonia, liver failure, renal failure, sepsis, host illnesses. Coronavirus overhyped exaggerated. 6% people listed died coronavirus actually coronavirus. People died uncontrolled diabetes renal failure coronavirus. type people dying coronavirus. hear reports kids 26 dying run. people think healthy doesn’t mean don’t unknown conditions genetic predispositions. conditions like say working deck Navy. They're long slow crawl depression obesity office workers actual labor trap that's difficult escape peppered labor law violations poor anything about.

Most people never pleasure working anywhere nice they're completely blind shitty fact need way.

It's going get worse companies get comfortable fuck workers.  labor US different China we'll things change. think saying need wear yet cause covid bad yet Dang. open doors windows work least something try cover ass, well lungs. 1600 positives 7700 tests.

Next door MN like 800 positive 21000 tests.

So behavior something else?

The weather colleges same. Keep going bro good shit hard hear that, I'm sure many ways love educators, sounds much like mom friend always teacher, knows well hard them, also loves teaching students. Three months... see you’re completely unfamiliar fucked America is.   Making claim Portuguese ""uncivilized"" really okay. guess Portuguese think means get free pass, really don't; understand sentiment sometimes can't stand people country, ""the Danish civilized"" argument, bigotry. Wait they're symbolic graves real graves covid-19 victims? use them? normal.

People always say ""it's bad!"" something fact bad. easier make believe hope goes away.

People say ""I'm fine"" even tooth pain go dentist. they're obviously fine lol. Downplaying bad stuff human nature. Agree. could killed people. Try send back serve punishment citizens don’t pay house stupid ass prisons. get people stop buying N95s surgical masks cause back then. homemade fabric masks market beginning. ask people ""please stop buying masks need doctors health care professionals"" people selfish buy anyways. downright tell people work get people stop. understand disparity death rate age range fine. Ignoring growing number younger folks developed chronic covid related conditions president fights federal court strike protection pre existing conditions, incorrectly implying numbers shared tempered negated impact 

Got source scientific studies demonstrating % young people getting chronic COVID related issues? anecdotal evidence usual? Australia NZ regional lockdowns specific cities/states entire country. Israel second lockdown entire country specific area. Like Auckland went back lockdown rest NZ still open I'm definitely curious see Tenet interest seeing bunch maskless people eating popcorn. Risk/reward entertainment right now. means absolutely nothing overwhelming majority America. Behavior: way one acts condones oneself, especially toward others.

Also

Behavior: way animal person acts response particular situation stimulus.

I get understand basic words, look instead looking ignorant reacting defensively childish way. many people family would kill reopen economy?

What’s good number there? _Surprised Pikachu face_ It’s easy solution all. read actually already produce enough food support global population 10 billion, issue distribution. food would spoil well gets people need it. Look “cold chain.” applies mainly vaccines, also applicable discussions around getting food people need it. US enter second election. clear economic push bring needed.

Yeah. Turns need media financial industry! Auckland. rest NZ still open. wide scale national lockdown entire country  restaurants open basically every single country world? “Behavior”

This fucking Reddit dunce shit. getting like 10% business places force shut down.  joke reply used wrong symbol currency, even though correct one title. Another chap pointed enough snark rile people up, apparently. Chicago Illinois epicenter, done reasonable job tamping recently compared much state (so far). Cases still pretty high, nothing like used be. gonna internet troll, least entertaining it. got cocky tried open everything back up. 

This isn’t rocket science people.   funny think tough, behavior childish pathetic. Well vaccine. works that's something. also name. agree here. virus hit, felt like end world... seemed like best could overwhelm hospitals. someone plans work healthcare friends do, understood importance this. Even though government telling us wear masks (and understood PPE shortage, seriously, get thought saying ""wear one one/want to"" would made things worse?) concern whole time hospitals would get overwhelmed would end another Italy... got close NYC, part, happen.

Now, hospital overcrowding much issue (or least assume since talked forever?) literally political pressure spread virus still know was. numbers keep going (or least stopped much testing) people exposing themselves, many get sick die... choice, guess.

Of course, many people spread others, know protect them. think need talk that. rather interesting leap made there. Equating interest kids guilty association. 

On contrary, spouse work health care. spouse worked directly COVID patients. spent 5 months locked home toddler (working home) full compliance COVID protocol. 

We still so.

To address “fake compassion”. It’s profession, I’ve spent nearly entirely 20’s studying working adolescents early adults.

I don’t know you, imagine really like person. It’s topic undoubtedly stirs emotions. However, emotionally reactive making snap judgments behind keyboard isn’t useful productive.

Good day sir. U realize order pandemic end need herd immunity right?? 19 year old won’t die, it’s bad thing party doesn’t interact old people. obligatory reminder factory farming contributes global warming along inhumane working conditions. Please consider reducing least ethically sourcing meat. illegal pre-corona. Trump getting punished anything emboldened them. think would help  Used work refrigerated warehouse meat processor business guess subleased part to.  general warehouse workers would often use us employees called in.   supposed full time USDA presence came couple hours day much ""looked way"" lot issues.   would let employees buy products deep discounts like $1/lb bacon always refused. almost like matter hard lockdown, open back experience first wave burn matter what. benefit areas data treat this. Yeah people around actually know anyone lives Sweden. family friends altered behaviour since pandemic continue so.

Some public health measures voluntary, others compulsory. Whatever case may be, least they're bad U.S. NZ Aus individual cities/states regional lockdown. Like remember NZ put Auckland back lockdown remember correctly rest NZ still open normal Auckland lockdown. think either country done full national scale lockdown entire country like Israel doing. Make wearing MASK normal, instead. Look Asia, wearing masks many years. worked Asian guy Toronto 4 years every time cold, guy would wear surgical-mask day long (commute office) never take day long. normal thing Asians wear Mask made normal here. wearing masks February remember getting weird looks store people confused. realize hit peak March &amp; April right? would predicted exactly one year ago. IIRC that’s involuntary action. lose control muscles. actually pretty decent bill. Cases rising Canada even back school. Since deaths lag cases around month, piece news largely relevant happening month ago Canada, currently happening. First agree appreciate math worked bit must disagree one detail. 

Have ever worked meat packing plant? personally big Smithfield plant next town assure (like factories) theres decent range different ages employees including older ones. good friends parents work (and gotten covid) mid late 50s senior end age wise, still young.

So point saying ""younger"" really apply differently amount younger people occupation unless occupation mainly older people (walmart greeters?).

I find median death age USA 48. Maybe found bad info though.

 wanted say becaise likely risk even claimed. feel like start giving smaller fines party goers too. Like okay, aren’t hosting party won’t 10k fine like $500 fine premises? Seems legit me. know can’t gathering big. Sucks suck. cares them. I’m talking me. Gimmee gimmee gimmee. (After heathcare workers, teachers, prisoners course) feel this!! also unplug lot. really helps. Look social butterfly knowing least 150 people. 


I name 150 people pressed real hard. Yeah like theater experience whatever call it. concentrate much better cinema home. Mostly fault, home paused smoke check phone such. 

So basically paying movie ticket order force self watch start finish without pausing lol seems pretty silly blame current plan.

No one's blaming ""the current plan"". Everyone's blaming chronic lack actual plan Well, they'll plenty time lobby since they'll jobless homeless. People told ""you can't live fear"" times. I'm tired it. People use word ""fear"" relation covid usually trying justify actions. US getting like 70k+ cases day one point one gave shit. US losing around +-1,000 people day still one gives shit. highly doubt US national lockdown again. idea dry ice cold. Good know!

Sucks developing world though :-(  think it’s saying federal regulation enforcement insufficient - doomsday all. Anyone wants wear mask afford one access one point. Availability masks people wear masks. Yeah. Vertically. Yeah, wants live Dakotas. 15 stamps current passport would every country gave stamps still.

My last passport maybe 35.

I US navy traveled lot places working many foreign nationals. also worked 2 international companies time Navy least 5 different countries business them.

I American talking shit too. support harsher work conditions anything acting like conditions ""hellish"" ridiculous. Many colleges opened month ago, yet...

With today’s data, US showing following (7-day averaged) week-over-week trends:

27 straight days declining deaths
46 straight days declining hospitalizations
52 straight days declining percent testing positive
49 50 days declining They're making dig *own* graves. They're going killed they're done. symbolic covid victims they're putting risk. Exactly right, unfortunately idiot's viewpoint replied common here. Oh 800 thousand day. Fuck em probably fat. need move Denmark apparently filled mindless sheep cunt. think also forgetting fact like half Indias population youth(like 600 million). US ageing population like dveeloped countries compared India generally still relatively large youth population much lower proportion population elderly since 6.3% India 65 conpared US 15% 65. Covid known generally affect elderly far youth much lower chance dying  Man, headline trying pull doomsday card, it’s failing miserably  somehow end Israelis stealing Palestinian land...    Ahh didn’t think meant cure preventative measure. Like cleaning hands. Won’t squat infected meant prevent infection. soon exposure effective? Good question. long remain effective dosing? Also good question. remain effective continue use long period time? 🤷‍♂️

Maybe combination measures like Plan B - wear mask, clean hands etc, find risking exposure take it. active cases New Zealand connected either overseas travel Auckland cluster. new locally-acquired case outside Auckland since 15 May. ""feel anything happiness knowing entitled cunt got deserved"" 
The word looking German's ""schadenfreude"" ^(exact writing may incorrect) well, second-wave coming i'm starting feel we're gonna get it. mind, think even question whether take vaccine not. even lack transparency, 1 18000 getting serious sh\*t I'd take chance. 

still, would nice know happened. Tell reached 200000 deaths Sounds like city America. state mandate forcing people wear masks indoors public. First weeks happy see people so. hardly anyone is, including workers behind counter. It’s crazy. It’s like people decided tired wearing means it’s gone. Contact tracing achieved epidemiological investigation teams, big data, lowest level residential community organization, lowest level medical organizations CDCs.

20 people (close contacts confirmed cases asymptomatic carriers) quarantined designated places receive tests. Contacts 20 people ""close contacts"" yet radar, digital health code would green, means higher risk level might face travelling access restrictions without negative test result. 3rd world dystopian nightmare. another thing they’ll complain about. Lemme take stab it:

“George Sorros made workcamps antimaskers told truth democrats rounding up”. 

That par snowflakes? Let's overreact. sucks, considering amount test run, mask mandate restricted *social bubble* situation way better march.

Cases rise (was expected school reopening), would bet measure hardened rather full lockdown. surprised see sport club bar/restaurant closing see size social bubble (number friends see) reduced 4 Yes, really believe doctors falsifying reports. Why? Tribal mentality. Us VS them. Scientific illiteracy. Poor education. Propaganda. belief everyone actually greedy scumbag. Faith celebrated reason states. Awful emotional intelligence. Zero empathy skills. Non-existent ability predict realistic consequences everyday problems. Family friends also illogical. Family friends ostracize present evidence. Etc etc.

Here's short story: met sad, sad man college. short temper, completely full himself, ignorant general, contrarian nature, loved pedantic, see anything wrong objectifying harassing women advances, tended shout people provided solid evidence contradicting beliefs, wanted force he'd power people (but never able land job field, even desk clerk), able date anyone fit high standards, frequently listened conspiracy theories debunked decades before. said, seriousness, humans get choose want live fertilizing egg. completely sentient, sperm. Seriously. got choose gender, look, health, etc. We're person sperm now, never changing. lives entirely fault, makes women inferior men, somehow. That's worked course, believed refused persuaded otherwise. special brand crazy.

He chose reject reality completely, knowing full well deep inside wrong everything. lose? Friends? Family? really point. Nothing real anyway. relationships shallow, made way. thing kept going insane conspiracy theories made people like hero everyone else villain. really surprised he's anti masker believed Covid cases 'overreported falsely diagnosed', would brand him. honestly would shocked continued way thinking grave, anyone else like matter. Sweden though, cases still trending Nice! know works way get lockdown. lift lockdown, rises again. evidence every country lifted lockdown.   think adapt new things better adults. We've mask mandate city long time now. kids dealt fine. ones wearing masks noses. like people without accent speak another language sound like native? get people subreddit. say care people cruel others moment get chance.

You're afraid emotions clouding judgement. don’t KNOW long-term effects disease. That’s problem. hell bringing race this? Show stats Sweden get hit flu common colds much others Spain, baked society. Genuinely curious. HAL sound like he's 'nowhere', sounds like he's anywhere large region northern US/Southern Canada, agree quite ambiguous still accent. Yes, worry, plenty hospital beds accident. likely may much help already situation.

I’m awaiting details Many countries still control here, UK, France Spain account lot cases rush? closed months.... someone israel, got say good first round public thought corona pretty much nothing. 18k-20k cases peak 200 deaths point 4 new cases day really thought covid bs. made people ignoring safety protocols, went huge parties, clubs ect

Very unfortunate :( weird saying person feeling now, due data privacy. data, anonymous woman trial feeling good, better never recover?

What harder prove caused vaccine understand, inject somebody something becomes ill, reasonable assumotion injection caused it. 

Maybe regular process, tell? want people trust vaccines, need transparent point. vaccine month ago. Watching this, sputnik Sinovac vaccines skipping trials, false data even study published Lancet enourmous profit political prestige around whole thing, me, simole economist simply buying shit. Maybe home ""to go"" stuffy apartment worse airflow backyard. fine 200 innocent people died ? - matter many tested positive, many innocent people dies - people likely ""80 year old fat people"" - work meatplants, likely ""normal aged, normal healthy people""

Bragging many positives also wrong.. basically, nearly 200,000 deaths hoax. 
ok, gotcha./s also point time idea asymptomatic completely new pretry radical, pretty much one first cases. Also hand washing good hygiene also pretty radical. little historical context ya love it. absolute genius. people all, potentially responsible someone dying Covid. fitting dig graves. Nobody stroll outside raining fire. Community Service labor-based punishment certain crimes that's implemented US time. slavery. even mandatory - refusing community service simply put jail punishment crime committed default punishment anyway. anything OPTIONAL way judge cutting defendant break crime committed.

Really?...Oh, boohoo....really sucks wait sports. could anyone possibly think opening windows wearing masks using bit hand sanitizers would make freaking  closed , poorly ventilated , full kids several hours environment safe?? 

You're taking medicine POV. problem closed schools societal. 
1) can't ask *as much work* workers kids home : there's economical benefit open schools 
2) schools need closed, argue everything fine : opening schools reduce panic 

The question ask : part population ready put people danger protect way living? Remember reaction told treat old people second class people? maybe normal. syndrome ""normal life"", go clinic, tests release you. maybe good.

i would also love see usually goes. Even borders closed them, Americans still manage fuck shit countries. Unbelievable That's may maritimes, west coast, takes minutes notice. obvious cues (the subtle difference person BC Alberta pronounces words like ""about"", word choice like ""washroom"") less definable differences too.

The average Swede well aware countries fared much better, like neighbours. no, one celebrating Norway (at least yesterday) Denmark higher 14-day-per-capita-infection numbers Sweden. many Americans Canadians accent would sounded silly HAL southern accent Brooklyn accent example.

Yes movie targeted American audience wanted voice tied 'nowhere' accent would link specific region.  KEKW Tyranny  Many people can't survive like financially emotionally. Yes US still fucked Biden wins, return normal living point Yeah, 10 cool according religion.  there's idea... Americans = stupid 

Everyone else = smart Americans always loudest arrogant dipshits ever go vacation. rest world hates you. country this? regional, second national lockdown? can't possibly think that's *only* difference... Could county law-enforcement enough officers issue 14-day Quarantine Order every person present, leave building?  

Then 7 days later, again.  second time, anyone violated previous Quarantine Order (from 7 days previous) gets taken custody held custody 14 days. Standard Canadian English

It's that’s Canadians well received United States 

Your accent relative you, maybe large amount people one accent still accent. using movie targeted Americans main audience. Yes, chinese government handle (remember NZ virus deaths 3 months closed boarders), sure lot suffering get point. 

If seen Ai Weiwei, must-watch. classified Hal Canadian english without reading that. guess missed point article stating wanted voice identified part specific region.  Plot twist, Trump Puting solving Mexican border thing together. sure China got ahead this. Can't near extinction China survives.

You're understanding that's fine

Hint: said theory. even full year yet since Pandora's box opened? satellite archives! Excellent point. Also worth noting flu respiratory infections often deadly elderly never attach blame spread them. People sub seems forget people mortal. Maybe prevent happening? currently CFR covid 1.5%, IFR 0.3-0.5%.

You listen Trump, got right, 5 times deadly even deadliest flu strain, briefed well February. Oh, yes, problem said private, sorry. flu, go away April, always wanted downplay it. ... Starving artists starving. Finland big margin best Fennoscandinavian countries, followed DK SE close - export focused economies; Norway got hit hard also heavy oil price drop April(?). usual, futile compare economies. niece 3 wore mask first time yesterday complain moved mask.
Adults stupid ones. curious, contact tracing work? person virus, meets 20 people time contagious, would need check 20 people well? people meet? end?  Doesn’t even work “second”. come country second lockdown imposed July first one ended May That's going happen. virus still present even extreme lockdowns. soon lift lockdown, comes back. it’s really sad pathetic ppl acting like this. mathematically backed up?

Let's say need survive 12 months. late lockdown 1 month really provide bang buck early lockdown 1 month, equal even vice versa?

Intuitively would say early lockdown valuable, since provides time low cases. absolutely true US messed horrifically (I would say says current administration ability country's infection control), shown allowed shown. shown thousands individual stories pain Chinese government caused citizens. 

If seen Ai Weiwei, must-watch. world hates americans see mean, technically authoritarian government function correctly would always work better good democracy (think LKY Singapore-style, North Korea style).

It's however deep topic, always related economics education, let's say authoritarian democratic governments work better right conditions presents, yes, often not. China part shares data medical professionals across world. le Reddit infectious disease expert lot people area don’t think first infection even possible “drink openly public”  

That’s interesting point make - would expected US-American make point “they” often seem “religious”, Canadian.

Outdoors, typical wind speeds m/s. translates one full exchange air surroundings every 2 seconds. big crowd, may less air completely fresh, get idea. 

Indoors, standards vary 3 10 air exchanges per hour. gap 2 orders magnitude.

Of course, environments achieve kind ventilation indoors. Typically, ventilation would force flow downwards (better droplets) upwards (slightly efficient). requires false floor, permeable ceiling, heating pumping air phenomenally expensive terms energy consumption. possible given infrastructure. 

Even cross flow ventilation wide open windows achieves fraction air exchange outdoors, cost ridiculous amount energy terms heating. netherlands seeing 20 times many daily cases 2 months ago, number rising. USA seeing .5 times many cases, number falling. gap gigantic. guess guys need start staying home wearing mask! can't ""still way careful"" us kind numbers! Yep. school losing funding compared last school year 30 less students enrolled. student chose go county state online program, lost money them. moved parent’s basement. read good proportion cases spread households, moved out. parents sometimes go restaurants, refuse wear masks home. must gotten conspiracy theorists. getting worse moment though.

Biggest problem seems people 20ies partying. bars education high school probs get restrictions week. think school setup stay though.  really. college's students share blame. extreme cases. Obviously extremely real concern one want downplay, overwhelming majority cases require ventilators.  21 hour delay fetching comments.

The problem unless persistent public pressure backed funded lawyers, justice Wendel, employers already shielded employees, speak, form workers’ compensation—a non-judicial insurance system handles vast majority workplace injuries. employers provide workers access personal protective equipment, enforce social distancing, there’s “no way” they’re liable employees contract Covid-19 amid fact Trump’s order, appeared White House website late Tuesday, actually order meat-processing plants reopen.

Yet us, people, meant rainy day funds savings prepared bad things happen... way past looking countries whole numbers. spread infection uneven, zero sense locking lesser affected parts. Spain 10k+ daily cases still hospital occupancy COVID-19 patients 10%. now. Problem is, Madrid almost triple that. showing signs stabilization. They've managed curb similar levels Catalonia august, so, justifiable hope.  


France looking even better, hospitalizations-wise, even Paris. Again, now. Sure, overall numbers grow, wave spreads new communities regions. yet see effect schools reopening. plenty examples dealing spread without lockdowns, mostly probably avoided. all, region comes even remotely close Miami levels July - around 1000 cases per 100.000 per week. need staging locked forever. can’t people getting haircuts perfect immunity.

Depending many infected, guess standards practices actual protect workers covid. find odd focus meat plant workers, turn blind eye grocery store worker seen absolutely zero shutdowns. know many grocery store workers died Covid? we're not. 

The Spanish Flu killed around 675,000 people US, population 100 million.

Today population 325 million so. Adjusting Spanish Flu deaths current population, that's 2.2 million people dead.

We 6 months epidemic (realistically, way farther that) 200k dead, death rates dropping almost every state. nowhere even close. Stop spreading fear misinformation. mate! anyone eat knowing people dying PANDEMIC? sit room crying stomach growling hunger. Sorry killing grandma make hungry im psychopath. can’t take anymore...how people anti science? people want know deadly virus even doesn’t kill you, mess loved one’s health rest lives?? bad next pandemic be? need rely countries get accurate science data. nothing done? MERV 5 really much Covid actually getting 6 ACH 100% outside air better shape most.

Most schools around 3 ACH 20% OA.

Also 100% OA insane energy use might work fall/spring seasons, know boiler would even properly sized maintain throughout winter outside air freezing. also obviously depends climate. health care system goes bankrupt crisis robust Chinese virus fucked me

In facets areas life work family fucked Physical distancing, hand hygiene, improved ventilation indoor settings, indoor mask use part daily routines, us time. new normal continue living principles keep community rates low possible.

It us long takes get vaccine out. way, hell, public going get vaccinated expected continue terrible lifestyle. 

Social distancing masks necessary reached “endgame” - vaccine. aren’t endgame. people wish much want - heck chose wear mask socially distance forever please - country wide scale social distancing masking post December 2021. conclusive. Restaurants open 50 percent capacity rest state since June spike whatsoever. fact numbers continued decline. yes densely packed cities like Yonkers White Plains included that. Parties cause deaths, Covid does. prove infection comes food aerosols fomite spread food packaging? It’s really pathetic agree someone completely opposite politics something blatantly bad others cheering.

That said I’m convinced much thread brigaded could released Tenet like Bill Ted 3 stream online right away probably would given $20 see it, I'll probably wait hits streaming services without extra fee. 75,550 meat plant workers

Depending many infected, guess standards practices actual protect workers covid. find odd focus meat plant workers, turn blind eye grocery store worker seen absolutely zero shutdowns. know many grocery store workers died Covid?  weird concept employment think it’s responsibility small business owners stay open infect people lose money government incompetent can’t even agree stimulus package. It’s fault leaders don’t believe unemployment insurance social safety net, Americans spent last 40 years voting best interest largely fictional culture wars.

Seriously boss isn’t DAD it’s supposed weird patriarchal relationship he’s guy pays time. don’t think understand free will.

Being unable open restaurant illegal (cops come give ticket shut down) violation free will. talking murder jumping cliff here... actually force someone open restaurant. talking about. $10k fine make understand shit. 

That's bullshit excuse justify taking money people plunging debt. 

You people insane. Everyone party made decision go there. people made decisions associate chains people associate chains people. kid threw party responsible people choices. Acting like trying fine fee infinitely long covid chain asinine. victim, crime.

He responsible people attended party. 50% responsible person made choice attend.  Thank reply, sincerely understand case aomeone go said

Look, person got placebo, unlucky human

Or

He fine, spine nerve damage nothing serious

Or 

Patient sick old, would die anyway? “We also need set realistic expectations possibility vaccination eliminate COVID-19. Physical distancing, hand hygiene, improved ventilation indoor settings, indoor mask use part daily routines, us time. new normal continue living principles keep community rates low possible.”

We need living like long time. one don’t want going around maskless potentially responsible killing people. fact, probably won’t want going around anywhere all, given masks aren’t 100 percent effective either. tolerance spread DEADLY DISEASE. You’re completely right. entire website last year completely taken sock puppets. It’s like lying wait election season came went full force know Karens? think none fathers anti-maskers?

I blame Kevins equally. Well... good idea theoretically ): vaccines last decades caused severe side effects? Got 700.   Yes number may even low. wonder since new York many positive cases early virus spread slower there. Yup. Selfish narcissistic people culturally American putting individual freedumb collective wellbeing.

I want replace every single one anti-masker, selfish narcissist fatasses folks Vietnam, China, Singapore, know guys got cold lot people got last week Ugh, mom symptoms strong fever. got tested told expect positive.

My dad immediately went “buy bread”. everyone young healthy. really apreciate explanation permanetly severely damaged, hear high percentage recovered irrevirsibile, multiorgan damage. need organs, somehow instinctively feel nice have, whatever reason. would like hear media, death rate low, know soon explode. downvote say nothing say that...dude. Yeah I’m leftist come normalization forced labor just. Dumb.

Yeah happened fit one instance. future doesn’t? There's way result case spike. Restaurants loud design means people speaking loudly drinking alcohol. Every restaurant major financial incentives break rules. virus affect health also world economy.
I think developing countries still many daily wage worker, problem much worse, virus lot business closed, lead daily wage worker income thus make cant afford food. even worst lead hunger deadly.

So IMO can't see problem percentage total population. 1% small,but many family devastated virus, can't even imagine. would assume saying something Not? would good faith discussion.

You back tracking try defend false claim. NYC recorded little 250K cases. laughably insufficient testing capacity. 

Antibody testing peak suggests around 2M people infected. poor kids never chance. really don’t think understand free will.

You still decide want murder someone even law. still free so. choose to, among reasons, consequence said free will.

Even laws, free still consequence. Jumping cliff may kill you. Still free will. look fear respect. Fear would mean people chance getting hurt imminent death. afraid drive car? not, respect could get hurt therefore wear seatbelt drive safely. covid needed precautions living fear. 14% doctors can’t read news. sure hope Dan Andrew’s isn’t reading this. Well yeah. get bunch new restrictions soon, they're coming new weekly basis period.

So we're dramatic numbers now. worst 500+ people hospitals atm like 30. 

But getting hospitals, clearly increasing. 

Pols want kill restrictions, order avoid levels going high need lockdown again. think manage.

Again, stuff necessarily work places. 

We really good making things work, easily become abysmal failure another country applied stuff 1:1. 

For sure things copied, contries need adapt population.

So yeah, might give worse result opening schools places. pre-existing condition (which seems like is) it’s pretty easy look patient’s medical history see it’s there... - becasue seriousness based rate infection dude. numbers explode due kids college students.. later moves parents grandparents. can't ignore massive increases positives.. ""But young nobody died!"".  

This chess, playing go-fish. Nope, brainwashed, comparing country live in, also Covid meat plants, deaths.. could easily 1-2 deaths (to round up) - country 1/50 USA, 4 times dead.. agree - lot - still 200 meat plant workers die.. behave like decent person, pay respect, stop acting like brainwashed person !

Have also good week.. agree misinformation there, internet everybody research scientist. **Key Points**[ Español 中文 vitamin status, reflecting vitamin levels treatment, associated test results coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

**Findings** cohort study 489 patients vitamin level measured year COVID-19 testing, relative risk testing positive COVID-19 1.77 times greater patients likely deficient vitamin status compared patients likely sufficient vitamin status, difference statistically significant.

**Meaning** findings appear support role vitamin status COVID-19 risk; randomized clinical trials needed determine whether broad population interventions interventions among groups increased risk vitamin deficiency COVID-19 could reduce COVID-19 incidence.

**Abstract**

**Importance** Vitamin treatment found decrease incidence viral respiratory tract infection, especially patients vitamin deficiency. Whether vitamin associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence unknown.

**Objective** examine whether last vitamin status COVID-19 testing associated COVID-19 test results.

**Design, Setting, Participants** retrospective cohort study urban academic medical center included patients 25-hydroxycholecalciferol 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol level measured within 1 year tested COVID-19 March 3 April 10, 2020.

**Exposures** Vitamin deficiency defined last measurement 25-hydroxycholecalciferol less 20 ng/mL 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol less 18 pg/mL COVID-19 testing. Treatment changes defined changes vitamin type dose date last vitamin level measurement date COVID-19 testing. Vitamin deficiency treatment changes combined categorize recent vitamin status COVID-19 testing likely deficient (last level deficient treatment increased), likely sufficient (last level deficient treatment decreased), 2 groups uncertain deficiency (last level deficient treatment increased, last level deficient treatment decreased).

**Main Outcomes Measures** outcome positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test result. Multivariable analysis tested whether vitamin status COVID-19 testing associated testing positive COVID-19, controlling demographic comorbidity indicators.

**Results** total 489 patients (mean \[SD\] age, 49.2 \[18.4\] years; 366 \[75%\] women; 331 \[68%\] race White) vitamin level measured year COVID-19 testing. Vitamin status COVID-19 testing categorized likely deficient 124 participants (25%), likely sufficient 287 (59%), uncertain 78 (16%). Overall, 71 participants (15%) tested positive COVID-19. multivariate analysis, testing positive COVID-19 associated increasing age age 50 years (relative risk, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09; *P* = .02); non-White race (relative risk, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.26-5.12; *P* = .009), likely deficient vitamin status (relative risk, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.12-2.81; *P* = .02) compared likely sufficient vitamin status. Predicted COVID-19 rates deficient group 21.6% (95% CI, 14.0%-29.2%) vs 12.2%(95% CI, 8.9%-15.4%) sufficient group.

**Conclusions Relevance** single-center, retrospective cohort study, likely deficient vitamin status associated increased COVID-19 risk, finding suggests randomized trials may needed determine whether vitamin affects COVID-19 risk. Open windows Russia seem work perfectly get rid COVID assumed one would smart enough understand Given to? mean sold to. 335 million people suffering mental health issues related COVID.

Try hyperbole fail make valid point. well sure course keeping schools 100% online smart thing do... talking asinine usa here. China special regard. Eastern nations cultures value greater good selfish individualism.

The US pathologically narcissistic, individualist, selfish. first time mentioning rates. moving goal post. Sorry friend, hoping people start obeying laws realized serious thing really is! right house party important people’s right live? OK. government done nothing, like U.S. government, would probably similar problem Germany. But, luckily, people generally trust government right thing emergency, mostly comply emergency orders. And, said, government actually something. bunch kooks, they're small enough number render efforts fruitless. 12 deaths day, according Google. three days 0 deaths past week though, reporting really strange it, keeps alternating really low number (0,1,2) low double digits (10,12,14) almost every day.

It's common see whatever numbers drop significantly weekends places reporting rigorous weekends, seems like there's less reporting every day, weird.

Deaths seem trending Wisconsin, little, although still pretty low overall, far. Hopefully stays way. heading fall winter, though, luck could change soon.

Your 'virus hoax' comments worth responding to. Yep I’m aware. It’s effort prevent misinformation readers, convince them. hope courthouse forces wear masks. Clinical Research Associate reviews reseach paients studies. Patient could placebo arm pre-existing condition. study docs PI typically discuss serious adverse events ensure want due investigational product. comment ever mention rate.

For matter neither mine sure talking about.

Also would compare rate new term area extremely large population versus area extremely small population? never tell correct story would suggest look alternate means comparison. fuck get there? Americans banned travelling? hepa filters uv light Private schools offer scholarships often, registered charity. Sounds like need avoid restaurants together. THIS.

The culture values secularism, intelligence, STEM education. 

China world's strongman regime. plenty like Africa Middle East. African Middle Eastern nations culture values secular STEM education intelligence. fact, get feeling countries cultures look human intellect education. guy gets it.

All people literally scroll page look deaths/day graph. curve right there, plain view. flat. scar faded point longer see husband's. yes Pp US. possible parents religious exemption hhough. put incentive, stir economy. Snich neighbpur 7 them, get tax reduction 10 pounds. Lovely idea! narrative bullshit. People demonizing Sweden months locking down, it’s clear data right, we’ve shifted “oh actually locked socially distant due culture” . It’s dishonest rhetoric point. Sweden deliberately intentionally took less restrictive approach better nearly metrics it. 

It goes show strict lockdowns, like Israel suggesting here, way approach this. Good point, let's wander streets instead Wisconsin fucking tourist Mecca right now. Door County packed like 4th July since week Labor Day sign letting up. county hospital won’t test COVID unless severe symptoms, make go Green Bay, gets registered another county. tons positive cases still shows almost none, people flooding here. Restaurants getting ready close season social distancing gone window, bars full. Campgrounds packed Airbnb’s full looks like virus isn’t here...To illustrate crazy week onward usually hotels close, restaurants scale back dinner service, retail stores drop 9-9 10-5 one things happened reservations show won’t late October. See, even see punishment, community service education. Sometimes get desensitized issues see repercussions problem first hand. Digging graves corrects that. punishment wordwide, tbh. pandemic magnitude every year? That's really ""the epidemic over"", hope correct. peer reviewed?

I’ve read studies months ago say opposite Today: reported new Covid-19 cases since pandemic began see people claiming covid airborne aids people claiming sniffles. People want believe whatever want virus without looking evidence. Hopefully long term change, brief dip flu season. fires north we're already seeing people displaced homes I'm afraid may lead exposure as-is. fully agree wrong live lenton student consensus never invited many people started showing up, thrown parties (before covid) isnt much happens youve allready lost control party then.

The Police turned became hostile aggressive rather agreeing end party.

It given kind fine.

Your version events couldn’t control party blamed someone else’s actions doesn’t seem square real sequence events... less corruption Mafia CDC, FDA, White House

^(I'm going Europe this.) Thanks, talking sub. Funny thing (well really funny), every yokel take seriously, actually got covid like listened, bad. expect scene play winter. lost war. Reconstruction. much """"Each Dixie boy must learn mind Uncle Sam."" I’m sure it’s still even meaningful basically, FT reporter lot data visualisations indicated resurgence second wave. back August though. Maybe meets second wave criteria, even specific criteria take lot comfort idea lot people lot good things population level slowly surely, humanity pushing ball mountain. try lose sleep occasional knucklehead, try remind I'll never understand everybody's personal situation.

For lot questions like OP's, try take approach, ""okay, want go gym? make happen minimize risk feel good possible it?"" obviously impossible tell.

Agreed. sit wait scientists come accurate peer-reviewed info instead trying spread panic. People. Socially. Distanced. afraid. virus. flu non-existant socially distanced places. Great. Social distancing fights COVID effectively. social distancing thing hoaxers complaining about! 

Don't get it!!?? also possible doctors think question silly second wave already started. Nah, understand standards. Let explain clearly you.

If break rules made people charge, send naughty step take away toys. putting granny grandad risk going land long sleep.

Simple enough? 到时候世道会变的。 people saying vaccine, feel purposely rushed give politicians office election boost. would get vaccine.. rushed market.. that's LOT Americans saying to. subreddit filled nutters making dangerous claims expecting burden proof fall onto everyone else. Well, going fill itself. 

Not unless Jeebus comes deed. class online. besides, think dying getting crippled covid worse falling bit behind school. smh.

It naivete gets ""nowhere"". persistence makes like russian bot. Well seem okay killing people get economy going, I’m asking personal context it’s easy chicken hawk it’s someone else you’re killing. 

So yeah, gramma first?  Fuckit she’s old. Thanks knowledge! area gets 2 weeks winter. mean me?  Literally response ""people dying"" ""ya enjoy eating out.""

Seriously, understand preference eat important peoples lives? That's called confirmation bias.
If French, say thing French.
Or Italian.
Or Brit. Happy wait. Simply look death hospitalization curves see though. understand people purposefully blinding that, instead wringing hands absolute case numbers baseless metric.

I would predict we'll small resurgence winter, extent saw year. worst behind us. think best thing kids fall 8 years behind? 
Can't wait grade 4 class full 20 year olds. also good way get skin cancer.

Just take supplement like normal person. apparently harder US countries. Fauci great this, understand need provide grim, real details forecasts, also needs chill stuff. downvote, hear out... 

We're heading fall winter months. late winter spring, least summer look forward to. dead winter look forward to. Seasonal depression already real thing. Mix cabin fever + possibility never over... there's going lot depression suicides year. 

I'm fortunate work company allowing us work home/remotely foreseeable future. choice? expect hunker need feed family? 

I disagree looking ""rosy side"" embracing positives, especially New York made much progress. fight anxious thoughts never ending every day, cling onto fact we've lowered cases New York, parts across country, hospitalizations deaths despite cases up. change tragedy lives lost, gives HOPE maybe follow SARS pandemic burn off. Probably not. maybe. I'll wear mask abide best practices rules ensure family stay healthy.

But Fauci... ""COVID first many upcoming pandemics""... gotta chill little doom gloom. get need see grim side things get people wear masks but... point pandemic, many whose mental health taking serious toll predictions helping.  Whenever see comments misinformation sub, please sure report remove. incredibly helpful! I’m calling overlap Americans specifically (should clarified) aren’t cool cool things like chain gangs involuntary labor done inmates. didn’t say anything long term immunity don’t prove anything. claim Sweden left nursing home patients die asked proof. don’t know you’re getting defensive. Typical unfortunately. I'm sure we've seem similar hostility.

Here's latest case/death charts Florida running 7-day averages. Numbers coming may encouraging Florida 59.31 deaths per 100k think fame objective? Pfizer fist fucking country repeatedly decades now, sudden trust because....

Reminder, company paid doctors keep needlessly prescribing opiates keep money going KNOWING creating addicts. 

But yeah, totally trustworthy now. handful cases world outdoor transmision. Indoor dining definitely risky game though. got paying people smart him. thought would one strengths president - surrounding smart people / best get good move. 

Guess missed mark one -_- Stop spreading shit, dude. attitude going get us nowhere. planning keeping routine now. And, since started.

My family stay indoors go get essentials curbside pickup. 

Though. might change groceries delivery. Economic collapse, poverty, missed cancer screenings, cancelled surgeries, children missing education, mental health damage lockdowns life dreams evaporating - yes, deadly. *pollyannaish* didnt propegana kno right show hard citations what? want prove negative? *your* job provide evidence viable long term immunity that's claim *you* making; Hits nail head, vegan know feeling bit bullet went vegan. really wired used talk vegans somehow stupid cleaning equality animal rights. Yes, are. opened awhile back immediately shut weeks cases went county got put onto governor's watch list. Wonder it'll different time, especially Board Supervisors saying enforce state requirements. like saying car good condition, can't drive it. study found correlation. Given fact nearly infectious respiratory diseases spread easily fall/winter. hard imagine cold effect R0. feel kind like we're back March ignoring obvious masks people say there's seasonality. probably is, things bad even negative seasonal impact Agreed, know downvoted notified reply. LoL. thing downvotes - reddit karma pay bills could care less. know lots bills? People lots kids so, said before, kids can't bills. U shut till cases extremely low able contact trace leads containing major spreads. should’ve national plan. nyc around june formed tracing team worked. get covid nyc tracers come house allocate hotel show contact houses tell quarantine days grocery shop needed. help keep numbers low past months plus mask mandated public places. think may meant comprehend instead apprehend? reportedly took money China downplayed coronavirus. Surface transmission isn’t major source cases bathroom properly cleaned able reduce spread disease (it works every disease)  Shall wait see months? need rush conclusions. Madrid cases began increase inside dining restaurants (and bars) reopened June eclipsed previous high spring. 

And happen NYC, course, restricted. virus called American Dream. came true. success individual led devaluing community, gets us.

We masters unintended consequences, suck drastic change. We're long, unpleasant correction rest world. Pretty discouraging hear people talk like this. 

Id embarrassed little discipline, nevermind openly admitting it. Here's latest COVID case/death charts Placer Country, running 7-day county pretty well overall. They're currently 9.94 deaths per 100k population. That's well US per capita average 58.28. 

Here's counties ranked per capita death hard say we’ll see get real bad far hospitalizations deaths go winter... beginning didnt know wear mask not, info place. makes sense things bad then, although think weather little it. Im hoping everyone sensible opts spend less time socializing time staying healthy winter. Maybe we’ll even see less severe cold flu season since everyone wearing masks everywhere want kids die? don’t keep schools closed we’re absolutely sure vaccine works, millions upon millions kids die. ones don’t live life crippled miserable long term effects covid. stupid question answerable.

What ask much risk acceptable. Getting broken pandemic help either I'm stuck inside day way heal heart cancelled college semester!! awful understand health others glad inside keep people healthy. hope mental health recover get vaccine. Whatever. soon get mine cease problem. difference tests ok, timing getting results back makes effectively useless. fines begin airlines add languages contract carriage. wish would it. I'm naive. know live democracy. Electoral politics solution. :) Fear face reality. think that? Ask anti-vaxxers that...

Expect see universe hearing answers. DeSantis going start suing... IIRC studies showed virus particles linger indoor air 3.5 hours. times I’ve people house don’t run AC time leave they’re there, usually go stuff rooms til times passed. LOL
Keep schools closed 2028.
Ok maybe there's point talking you. agree. said things like before, I’d guess isn’t meant. Probably referencing “declining infection numbers” false hope near term. I’d agree 100%. Compared time last year (or previous year) FAR socially distant mask usage SIGNIFICANTLY, point.

Not mention, travel down, large events cancelled, people working home. ""Imagine hill willing child die on."" 


FTFY lots things people life aren’t “necessary”. People drink alcohol (massive health consequences) smoke cigarettes (massive health consequences) eat unhealthy foods (massive health consequences). restaurants follow common sense rules like spaced outdoor seating, what’s issue? Hmmmm. Germany try fighting two pointless wars time. we’ll see balanced budget is. Indeed might Yep, love science supports views. Mmmkay, nice life spend 10-30% GDP? that's countries spent coronavirus lockdowns. I'm impressed happy you. Citation needed guess nobody meant commentor replied to, also see question could seen hypothetical.

Still, I'm exactly sure point I'll go limb righties here. want leaders parrot whatever experts say, want someone exercise good judgement behalf. real world means informed little information right takes see times experts call stupid appear left-wing bias.  thinking like $15,000 fine would help airline recoup wasted fuel &amp; labor ADDITION lifetime ban. passenger pay go collections &amp; ruin credit. punishment risking people's health much higher parking ticket lol say “lack” testing, saying don’t ENOUGH resources testing? much testing going on, EVEN THOUGH we’d able meet demand?

If latter, that’s good thing, right? decide risk potentially losing loved one worth wedding. simple way knowing affect loved ones. doctors already unfortunately posted guy well, airline flying on? fly around country last week American Airlines, mask compliance poor terminals flights.

FAs would tell unmasked passengers mask shortly boarding, air care. one flights, guy sitting across isle brought large Pringles, take-off demasked slowly ate whole 4-hour flight. word FAs. put mask back landing. heard forsythia good too. really change reality tho perceptions, cant trust government republicans charge. Aftet 9/11 epa told people air NY safe, not. guys brash clumsy standard operating procedure conservative administrations. put stop types events likely spread, spread slow fewer people die. think public safety measures thrown favor people whatever want, whenever want? Don’t know. gave gender became spectrum fetuses weren’t considered life. Ahh we’re going back hamurabi code see Grass Persecutory delusions common among types ""Christianity"" swing far right. next months rising infections show far spread reinfections really go. think reinfection common people would like, betacoronaviruses tend reinfect us time. 

Possibly SARS-COV-2 attenuate/mutate another coronavirus causes cold years, still might wreak havoc. I'm telling people stay home nothing. I'm pointing reactions right fault. Sure, could reasonable he's saying, maybe controlled. 

But Trump treating information past couple months, things tend work Social Media. really blame nearly turning dude ""Network"". would going level insane too, position.  flown much American Airlines case. fly around country last week, mask compliance poor terminals flights.

FAs would tell unmasked passengers mask shortly boarding, air care. one flights, guy sitting across isle brought large Pringles, take-off demasked slowly ate whole 4-hour flight. word FAs. put mask back landing. Viruses selective pressure less deadly. virus can't spread kills give someone else. tend mutate spread easier, OP asking. love work needs title click increase traffic site adspace valuable.

Truth suckers. Cbc needs money.

That said love cbc radio. Nothing click interesting decent music. mean SELFISH Oh no, poor fragile ego Would rather lie you? don’t make drug dealers dig grave, people DUI. fine acceptable. South different schedule Northeast US Britain. 

Climate one factor transmission. behavior. People relaxing restrictions starting act like pandemic also lead increase cases.

The silver lining spike would increase compliance winter actually hits, could blunt inevitable outbreak then.

Because everywhere temperate northern hemisphere (Britain, entire continental US, northern Mexico, etc.) see large increase infectivity respiratory diseases winter. think really becoming ridiculous. Perfectly ridiculous. Hold on, americans travel restrictions much Europe? get Germany? yep, come handy even local government failed miserably combating virus, and/or hiding shit public, like Taiwan (where from) zero native case months step abroad, tested positive left right. I'll happy works 80% time. Reported misinformation. 


Stop spreading lies. Thank post. I’m sure you’ve downvoted...I suspect Pfizer social media team work. even that, know many intelligent people anti maskers n shit  Wow, numbers coming week week. Two weeks ago 3000, last week 2000s, even less! Rest country, look learn! steamed disinfect completely insane advice. hool up. get say anti vaxers conspiracy theorists say reckon putin  trying make people get vaccinated. equally ridiculous conspiracies....  pushing cases time save lives?

It better cases new treatments discovered them.

Because like Sweden say ""let's let people get ill treat them"" die. instead opt wait untill treat them, die.

All time treatment getting better, want push cases long future can.  also 60 million orphans streets data about. read somewhere hospitals must take covid patients, recieve money revovered discharged leads sending everyone home die recovered. really relly India's data. politician I'm thinking of, makes look bad. wondered first time seen someone oddly downvoted. really get mind blown find CDC inept, easily corrupted outside groups like politicians insurance companies... mainstream medicine blindly follows despite overwhelming evidence conclude. 

That thing people blaming everything Trump, things better next guy gets office. thing Trump stupid enough make manipulation public. Future presidents may dumb. Yes, excuse alterations.  fact people still hanging onto ""massive numbers permanently damaged"" strawman sad.  I’m sure markup is, may want check shopping order store adding everything cart home comparing receipt. That’s Sam’s club. hate practices too, get massive pork loin 16 bucks get 36 chops mother. need hysterical measures first wave then? someone taking meds life long major depression anxiety issues, I'm loving lockdown. 


My government pays anyone else job previously almost full wage literally stay home whatever want. 


I used exact thing crushing self hatred, guilt shame useless contributing. 


I get people would quite shocked change, though get used anything, seriously doubt anyone's depressed already unless money related. 
I'm fucking expert lifestyle trying whole life this. love rocks....aint big surprise... That's problem trying cancel people (without specifically refuting claims). makes seem valid.

I remember everyone confidently saying government reading emails listening phone conversations. special level conspiracy theorist believe it. tried shut conversation say... ""of course do, everyone knew that...""

Don't follow crowd, they're loud... usually wrong. yes, US welded people shut inside homes lied outbreak 4 months people.

If remember correctly, European North American governments lied extensively severity outbreak efficacy facemasks shit hit fan there. American government moment still actively lying population too. Trump administration took control numbers, limited testing, downplayed almost 200K death toll. stuff redditors would accuse China doing, no?

I find people interesting single countries accuse certain things, somehow want acknowledge country done worse. relates virus, absolutely difference. admit want pick choose kind social gatherings acceptable giant hypocrite listened to. ""CaPiTaLiSm bEsT, eFfIcIeNt, eCoNoMiC SyStEm."" *Message sent Huawei™ Phone* indication surge terms affects? surprise me. still going take time though. Cameras Home Depot working often enough. stupid understand it

They malicious care.

Hanlon's razor apply fascists narcissists. busy partying dentist don’t recommend Colgate Yes, exactly this. used like guy responded to. stayed inside 100% time first 2 months pandemic. walks outside. got fat miserable. breath first time went outside half hour walk sat ass 2 months. this, increased chances getting worse covid infection. started working diet exercise that, I'm feeling much better dropped weight.

I agree point news fear mongers. keep talking specific instances bad covid infection. ""Perfectly healthy 30 year old gets covid dies"" ""perfectly healthy"" 30 year old. article says healthy, probably get yearly checkups health problem never discovered pandemic. also heard families' coworkers getting covid, experiences bad portray media. young, visit doc regularly, generally healthy, likely OK. hear media outliers, people lots health ailments.  China that's fine now. South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Australia, many countries fine now. ""The world"" probably country lot comfortable, almost like wearing mask all....

.... He's either troll ignored really know anything never around places trying assert intelligence. know accents different. There's way someone Ontario would sound 100% someone Calgary (both lived respective places whole lives) Appreciate response. think far better explanation COVID / SARS hypothesis many doctors passed around. Dude seen five hundred month? wife swears can’t. 200 week, like 250-275 instacart far rich. It’s actually appalling. Teach tricks

Family four btw. I'm kind camp way see it, even rushed vaccine downsides, virus may bad worse. But, like say, it'll likely us commoners get vaccine hopefully I'll feel better then. Read study. effect happened specific conditions. wont work treatment prevention. say possibility drug might help, study report first effect seen. like report saying ""petrol burns"" concluding ""we build airplanes"". YES take January. may existed January, link shows become DOMINANT late March. fines come legal system? That's OP asked. Can't fine people stupid shit without federal mandate, state ones cover commercial aviation. people things. seen person without mask really long time. suggesting reliable sources knowledge? worked lockdown.

Before lockdown 500 plus hospitalized. like 30. 

So like 15 times corona around now. 

The lockdown beat level managed stuff ever since - btw changes constantly adapt situation.

Furthermore. lockdown know WTF test capacity bad. lockdown worked timeout, make plans jack test capacity.

We need full national lockdown again. seems extremely unlikely me. works good enough targeted smart mini lockdowns. can’t conversation. You’re medical professional. You’re making coherent argument. understand you’re trying say. Look Taiwan. January, government took control mask production distribution. Stopped export masks ramping production. put price cap mask can't sold couple cents citizens allowed pick 9 masks every two weeks pharmacy healthcare cards. surplus donating masks world. even allow family members living Taiwan ship masks expats living overseas. US power, money resources same, get it. Oh right, probably universal healthcare.  countries Asia hit hard SARS learned implemented basically strategy. Living life mentality, even call living? life spent fearing death degree life wasted feels like hit like truck government offices dusting cobwebs trying update protocols last decade lol

Of course, doesnt help WH literally says one day, ""lol y'all states need figure out. K. Bye"" providing insufficient organization communication among health depts. time people UK US losing minds toilet paper gathering huge crowds inside supermarkets.

Actually, toilet paper scare happened HK well. time saw many people buying trolley full rice toilet paper. sparked celebrity pondered loud facebook shortage basic commodities. Unfortunately, even later denunciation hoarding stop people panic buying. (Yes paperwork) still suffering breathing problems, fires state definitely helping breathing.

I've heard many people claim early year never went get tested see antibodies. People got really good year self diagnosing. Yeah, Texas. stupid fucks California flocking there. reactions things entirely fault.

I believe meant ""aren't"", right? jerk. people read immediately downvote.

Social Media absolute ruination world, also believe goes ways, mentioned. Karens Facebook fighting rights fly go grocery store without masks, telling people virus serious idiots. Plain simple; posts claiming leaving house death sentence toxic, too.

I flew beginning August. want to; end pandemic, flew. wore mask, wiped everything, took proper precautions. anxious weeks leading trip. went, came home, tested negative, fine. Maybe got lucky. Maybe came contact, mask protected me. Maybe come contact. knows? 

Again, again, point every day we're getting one day closer death, whether death COVID, sleep, heart attack, car accident, whatever. there's never vaccine? expected hunker forever? I'm saying take mask start returning life pandemic, saying expect ever return that.. trying stay positive live within new normal. numbers go again, I'll head back inside. numbers remain down, I'll continue vigilant experts like Fauci give OK.

I totally get coming from, idea never leaving house first many pandemics going drive people insane.

Disclaimer: say someone NY, state we, part, listen experts officials. encountered Karens states, understand totally wrong here. Maybe Fauci's messaging ***is*** completely warranted. I'm sitting, appears though he's stating facts, he's citing worst case scenarios inducing unnecessary stress already stressful time. that's beauty sub - come together educate one another what's going places around country world. probably specific causes. [It high likelihood brain damage concerns He is charged kidnapping/inflicting bodily harm well aggravated battery, according court records.

The judge gonna throw book him. get coming here, day day day, pretending like disease killed 200k US sent many hospital, despite huge efforts contain it, basically nothing?

What psychological process? drives much this? agencies similarly destroyed. scraping surface. Yet overwhelming majority idiot redditors spraining wrists jerking ""awesome!"" is. political scientists included term ""Scientists""? I'm fan China went business school teach pandemic affects, know knew them, many businesses clearly operating right edge viability fine margins stupid, name making money Yes, people using N95s hospitals otherwise need close quarters places likely COVID-positive. know cities giving first responders ratio N95 respirators situations masks inadequate, example house call exposed individual. may also see airports well. 

EDIT: answer question, yes leak sides. people's faces may better seals others, N95 designed able achieve perfect seal basically everyone beard (there wave scientists losing beards outbreaks started). N95 respirator hospital situation certain protocols, test seal actually spraying strong substance around check can't smell even whiff it. can, gotta put again. possible able test seals well. 

Honestly, people wearing N95 masks, unfortunately scarcity exacerbating situation. cost-effective wearing N95s time grocery store, etc. sound doom-and-gloom, early decisions classify route transmission less intense protocol, i.e. droplet protocols, rather airborne protocols, really terrible call. increasingly evidence primary mode transmission COVID-19 fomites (i.e. touching something touching face), droplets (i.e. inhaling air contaminated someone's sneeze method droplet formation), increasingly looking like simply airborne. main problem always strong evidence airborne transmission primary mode transmission, given asymptomatic carriers (who probably going around sneezing singing everywhere) causing outbreaks. 

The recommended safety measures effective airborne transmission exclusively outside wearing N95 respirator. Washing hands effective fomite spread, mandatory mask measures effective droplet spread, partially effective airborne. said epidemic appreciate clarification. Another soothing article Sweden got eight. Check Sweeden's death toll per capita many infected long term concequences, compare social employee benefits Sweeden. Plastics currently looked viable distribution method vaccine well work around issue.  wonder opening everything early first time caused numbers hit 70k day. Nahhh. Let’s open moment numbers go down. CVS Pharmacy: ***STONKS*** nothing happiness, contrary, people devastated angry incompetence leaders ignorance masses. predictable, parody account? Next gonna claim Muslims videos actors got antidepressants COVID-19 lockdown. 

I've able get outside dog nearly every day I'm able work whenever feel like (I built affordable gym house COVID-19) instead ""outside office hours.""

This pandemic freed perpetual wage slavery offered agency. Fuck anyone like that.

Literally nothing ever depress working cubicle farm. Fuck shit. Fuck 100 foot pole. Fuck forever. COVID-19 made life better want stuck office fake smiles people acting like fulfilled corporate team players literally every single one us broken minutia would rather chilling beach playing video games whatever idea fun is.

Being unable go social gatherings sucks. definitely does. makes waiting period really tough. I'll forsake social gatherings rest life means spend one day kissing corporate ass. government citizens cant afford jobs schools shut, resulting paradoxical mess moment 195,000 * don’t think fundamentally underestimate risk disease poses - think level risk tolerance much higher yours. 

1) say 1% infections 34 require hospitalization - don’t know consider unreasonable risk. little higher typically accepted risks? Yes. going stay away crowds forever (yes, I’m considering 2+ years) 1% risk hospitalization? No, leads next point...

2) entire conversation stems “what approach right now”, question “should continue practices following vaccine 2021”. take article says “most likely scenario” 50% effective vaccine - aren’t “completely immune” lower symptom severity - take 1% 34 require hospitalization *very least* treat upper bound. 

The question never “should ignore precautions today”. “what level risk acceptable allow current social distancing masks end”? current state things cannot stay place forever. Eventually endure level risk - society - me, cut 1% hospitalization 0.5, think low enough risk U34’s return complete normal. wedding entirely outdoors people practice distancing reasonably safe, plug situation in-depth analysis risk. Pretty sure debunked came lmao believe China’s numbers many people died

You can't defend US's 200k death toll, instantly change topic China's number. US trolls seem act way. anything 200k Americans dead? Multiple sources reported US severly underreported death watch news many countries clear hell chinese state media lot bought YouTubers I'm collect downvotes.   think Fauci say: ""Unless universal compliance guidelines, worth all"" ?

I'm honestly sure argued -- I'm saying human psychology important account for, keep people \*weren't\* half-assing whole time giving up. Flu killing people covid, months.

If social distancing, lockdowns, masks work expect less flu deaths. chart shows flu deaths matching 5 year average.

If covid deadly flu also expect covid deaths flu. chart shows opposite. possible government cover-up? hard believe cannot find plausible explanation.

If minimal cases (499 9/14), people actually much chance touch virus all, let alone build immunity masks.
If look data China mainland, minimal cases people flying China tested positive countries either. 

Anyway, masks definitely help, something fishy regarding low local cases # # positive cases people left island. people treat call girls like therapists imagine less sex worry limited availability (teletherapy way backed up), work day hours, emotional issues uncovered people find paid for. Depends area type interactions work, plug situation want in-depth risk estimate. So...what endgame here? understand. effort sell bunch stuff? What's point? people really fall targeted advertisments? ads delivered you? Plenty people part staying in. places longer spread control. US rare many people choose ignore spread like wildfire, plenty people US locked since started. feeling depressed able call doctor should. help. got insurance still therapists talk too. dark days they're likely get worse, take care mental health without sacrificing physical health health people around you. Cough, cough, goergefloyd cough. Cuz he's waaaay important 190,000 dead souls hooked crack lol 6 weeks built gym home. 4 weeks straight every day like 2 hours day. Really made month fly by. took break past 2 weeks I'm starting feel crappy again. Lotta dumb people. Kinda point thread. Although wouldn’t want Romney running joint, wasn’t wrong bout Russia. 🤣😅 great mental image there! even see him: like old wizened Kevin Costner playing “Open Range” character, 30-40 years later ... know care. contacted several times able afford supplies need classes. care care this. where’s evidence drop caused masks? many, many counterfactuals cities countries masks mandates introduced nothing. seems unlikely would make difference considering vast majority cases came environments masks aren’t worn anyway. I’m saying don’t work all, I’m saying they’re fairly irrelevant. People like gives sense security shows others take virus seriously. yes I'm internet stranger, experience far off. Felt flu like sickness Friday night, Saturday extremely sick, Sunday felt pretty good, Monday morning able work home (I'm essential employee usually would go work). 

Tested positive almost month got two negative tests allowed return work. whole experience literally felt like normal flu, middle summer.

He definitely eating next day though...  may doubt particular specific information. Remember Chinese spy escaped Australia earlier year? turned dud. issue lateral myelitis, rare issue associated viral infections vaccinations.  

All ""transparency"" stuff whiffs trolling politics. Zero tolerance means zero accountability. like kid beats school get trouble. coworker got back trip (flew another state back, attended family gathering) received call may exposed COVID. came work today wearing mask here. sent home. concerned exposure? wearing mask day briefly interact them. Concerned bringing germs home. Alright... came Trumpolini? Let's honest sounds delicious. know ill get diarreah after. schools already going fully online thanksgiving break, easy enough since it’s usually last week two semester. That’s harder spring break, right middle. Honestly go online call day now. .....Although saw news anti-mask protest hearing interviews, Fauci may point. Except know, indoor dining / bars / indoor activities, full offices / campgrounds / parks / shopping vast majority state gathering size it.

Not saying open would certainly say anywhere near pretty much open either. clear, government changes decides force people assemble instead, OK that? places, least US, never really even truly locked anyway.

Which we're leading world cases deaths. Even Sweden told people avoid unnecessary travel. virus moves do. spread pass people. minute stop faster things get back normal. ""In July 2020, press release the University Hong Kong (HKU) denied claim stated ""HKU notes content said news report accord key facts understand them. Specifically, Dr Yan never conducted research human-to-human transmission novel coronavirus HKU December 2019 January 2020, central assertion said interview. observe might emphasised reported interview scientific basis resembles hearsay.""

From wikipedia shared. time mess around schools universities re-opening many places. Let’s see sits six weeks making big changes. ya'll said Trump gonna lose overall 2016. Look turned out. Polls always given small boost Democrats simply cause many Democrats fail show vote. happen year like always. There's plenty foreign youtubers vlog Muslim life China. Perhap watch independent media says instead faux That's surprisingly high. God America disaster country.

But nah, really though. Reddit loves shit USA leave anything. Amazing country freedoms things country has. burning ground Portland would like us to. Trump pos survive. Hopefully peasants begin realize us versus elites make country even better, extremism sides media fueling fire, see happening time soon. saw commenter who’s teacher say school requires 10% faculty students would infected shutdown. would 230 people 2000 students 200 faculty members. That’s lot. 

And Georgia already shut school August teacher students infected. Brazil gotten things gotten things control? feel safe saying Bolsonaro worse Trump yet somehow they’re better us. Exactly, thanks, that's whataboutism, Im even american. Well, thing states they're populous still could areas experienced first spike. fact matter people it, less future less spread all.

There's phrase that, become extremely politicized sub ***NOT*** like it. dating. casual sex. looking actual escape maddening loneliness.

Fucking randoms going help anyone that. probably make lonely. I'll believe see evidence. hot air. went looking citation that...

Never mind fact Sweden successful all. top 10 deaths per capita (excluding Andorra San Marino, population less 80,000) -- US's constant fuck ups surpassed week ago. Even more, neighbors much better Sweden did. Denmark, example, around #60 deaths per capita.

Remember, headlines relative. ""Cases soar Holy shit WaPo trashy article. It’s sad statement makes less confident drug. Yup, spike back again! people expect lockdowns a. widely distributed vaccine, need push better testing, contact tracing, ways balance risks while

Our ""leaders"" *are* virus not. changed. way spread changed. virus move idiot passes someone else. people avoid non-essential travel unnecessary contact fewer opportunities virus spread. really simple. 

If area cases rising community spread low, means mask take walk drive something makes feel better. actally meet someone like that, connection. text friends now. part, match people ""mask wearers only!"" profile quick want jump bed. 

I would love meet someone relationship right now. going happen. doubt ever happen point. 

""Mask wearers only! Science supporters!"" new ""I'm hookups."" Yes, Dr Fauci others didn’t research yet showed much even homemade cloth masks could help. really early days back then. learned more, adjusted recommendations. Makes sense. 

I think people latch excuse dismiss best resource we’ve got, probably recommendations don’t fit self-image, lifestyle, preferences, world view. 

Okay then. won’t friends. many others said, fuck police. think they’re interchangeable inject Coca Cola arm see goes Extrovert fine like...July/August. LDR plans move early 2022. seen since January can't keep up. I'm sad, sad, might able see next spring like...just thing seeing future brings. *Dana White entered chat...* Absolutely great news !!

The vaccine competition kinda somewhat blocked goal finding/making better treatment, happy hear this👍 bad. should’ve paid better attention responding to.

Again infections expected haven’t forced close. don’t wish anyone harm but, order get control, deniers need start seeing friends family member hospital bed ill... even may take seriously. problem anti-vaxxers. vaccine provides 100% effective protective immunity. Even vaccinated, there's chance remain vulnerable. long whole herd sufficiently immune (e.g. anti-vaxxers), epidemic continue. much interest everyone around vaccinated, too. Ah American military still shit always is. surprised. get taught pandemic plans, get taught contingency plans. I’m curious NYC single digit deaths considering people going subway, going house parties, protests, still living dwellings share central air, going work etc. much GoFundMe to?? people sub weird. get rock hard boner thinking terribly ravaged America COVID?  read ""invincibility allowed sub"" Yeah telling single people date/hook year never gonna actually work. Unfortunately actually looking relationship, kind conscientious empathetic person would make good partner exactly kind person less likely meet right going taking unnecessary risks

If looking one night stand know exactly kind person would middle pandemic tho Fair enough recently tested?  You’ve mistaken another commenter. 

And don’t know mean cases Georgia. every school state deal infected students. Absolutely. mean say fast food workers deserve respect. Point more, general, people understand mess script life-threatening consequences opposed forgetting pickles burger.   Lol might agree public cannot emotionally handle truth probable pandemics come. 

Wait hear Osterholm talk antibiotic resistance! That's really going freak everyone out.

Thanks well wishes friend. sucks man, gets worse every day. needs turn corner soon. better dipshittery going spreading hopes dreams herd immunity t-cells. look hopefully April-to-June next year, need buckle fuck cold flu season. Hahaha one day soon brother! I'm screenshoting keep forever. We’re two adults, toddler newborn, think grocery bills glimpse future.

I buy bulk vacuum seal single meal portions. health, budget environmental reasons I’ve cut back much meat eat past couple years, makes big difference. also buy local meat cow shares family works way less $/lb compared grocery store. 

We big veggie garden every year, cuts back much spend spring summer months. make ridiculous amount strawberry freezer jam every June (this year 39 weeks pregnant picking strawberries make jam) last year. husbands family farm go pick apples family property make absurd amounts apple sauce (and apple butter apple pie filling) fall.

And learned grocery shop grandma survived World War Two living Amsterdam never lost wartime mindset. check what’s sale figure make that. something really good deal stock up.

In winter bake bread, year treats baked goods home made.

Once twice week fridge clean meals use leftovers make dinner (usually pizza nachos). Waste not, want not!

And lucky able breastfeed son currently breastfeeding daughter. Formula crazy expensive!

And lastly, grocery store great points program usually manage get $50 worth points month. It’s definitely nice bonus!

As kids grow family meals increase size I’m sure grocery spending increase well. life! pizza delivery driver dangerous cop. naaaaah cops given free reign.

My God America disaster country. rigid class society special privileges depending class occupation. aristocracy. People like apart peasant class little right. Cops, rich, corporate owners politicians apart nobility class free reign them. yes single people eat shit never try date escape maddening loneliness.  Oh, know that. really suggesting elective procedures unnecessary. American healthcare system still built fraud unnecessary procedures though. Case point US doctor charged 10,000 dollars 8 dollar COVID antibody test. haaaaaaaaaaaaa

just raze theaters. time go online change system. covid cause that? specifically, protesting illegal Melbourne BLM protests took place. government discouraged asked nicely it, ultimately allowed. harder lockdown protesting permitted activity, current protests illegal.

So political favouritism. BLM protest today would also illegal. crazy beyond imagination. cancelled Lufthansa flight 20h departure, full refund granted without hesitation know Spain massive rural areas? lot alt-media people full ""hot takes"" virus ignore fact people social distancing.

The Levitt/herd immunity take assumes cross-immunity common cold protecting communities affecting epidemiology. proven ALL. T-cell immunity works.

Also, compares flu, breath talking cross-immunity common colds? two theories once, combine explain outcome. Nonsense.

Flu non-existent due social distancing, we're getting flu epidemic shaped curves?

This nonsense. Dry tinder, ""oh wee poor little old people, sadly died rest us need get back work,"" give break.

This take common, nonsense. sentence indicated simple causal effect. seem unable grasp reason. Eh theyre meat plant workers..../s

Christ... Also expat living China. Quite. China extensive contact tracing, screening, testing infrastructure now. Every visitor school screened. Every staff member tested least twice. People feel secure government actually took necessary measures contain virus. They're disbelief shockingly terrible U.S. government ""serves"" its' people. majority Americans okay death toll. sad reality leadership (White House) is. wait Halloween parties, Thanksgiving, Christmas, holidays, temperatures drop. manufacturing sector. It’s funny manufacturing never got mentioned relief schemes mentioned quite lot return normality boosting economy speeches. Mask compliance everywhere. Makes big difference. honestly see children wearing masks correctly far less fight adult. chime in, confirm Oregon little rustic - dont lot flushing toilets there. Kind strange visit fancy coffee shops ask make sure sprinkle sawdust composting toilet. there's typically less people per sqft grocery store imagine trial participants going independent lab getting tested antibodies though. result would definitely indicate whether got actual vaccine. know I'd ask Canadians say 😂 sorry hear caught shit. keep tabs doctor, sounds like going anything else unless symptoms get worse.  post removed because:

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* far profit thing goes, definitely don’t see current situation profitable all. There’s enough people there. ironically makes pretty safe. 

However, takes people visually seeing people going movies getting harmed people start going again. hope economy recovers soon I’m position that’s even dependant Covid restrictions movie theaters totally missed point. don’t want homeless think I’ve brainwashed. 
I don’t want lockdown damage me.
I want lockdown saves one single human life worth it? cost human life real money anyway? Ask someone lost someone close reason (not 1% chance disease) would give back again.
I trying avoid dresses 1% chance killing - far I’m concerned life worth whatever chose believe is, it’s everyone else’s value. Try keep humidity 45-65% studies show range keeps virus transmission lowest -70° standard temperature shipping medicine vaccines. big deal all. Always has... suppose near 200,000 since succumbed thought wasnt bad, either. families deal loss.

Come now, new virus. woods yet. per capita: france, spain, italy, uk, belgium, san marino sudden? Please stay angry mobilise voting time. irreparable harm country perspective non-americans here, California sitting ~364 deaths/1 million population, rate Netherlands (though, Netherlands peak early California didn't). Short term profits long term sustainability, apparently Bad move Dude come on..... honestly think heavily packed 20 million people Beijing fully safe COVID? I'm gonna check guy trust doctor. Man gonna add lot paperwork medical insurance search. Theaters could play anything public still watch. I've covid two weeks I've locked jn hotel. seriously standard care? nurse done ask temperature. anti viral, antibiotic, supplements , sunshine. standard wonder people dying long term effects. seems like ""sleep off"" solution. Austrians partying chilling huge groups like nothing going on. Sadly learn sentiment here, especially young party people, hundred new cases day nothing worried about.. How? Pretty much impossible tell difference between, say, Maine Martimes Accent. Ontonario and, say, Michigan also similar. Tourism 18% Thai GDP, 40 million foreign arrivals last year...

Sex tourism makes fraction that.  Weirdly enough, [studies nicotine might actually make immune Coronavirus reduced would mean smokers actually *less* likely die more.

She's upper age group sure, also chooses wants body, smoking 20+ years I'm pretty sure come terms could die time. Doubt Corona worries much. &lt;Good Tab. Huh. fucking believes Communist Party's propaganda news? never ones honest pandemic data. say thing indoor setting. imagine fans want stir air. HEPA want pay Well, Swedish constitution makes illegal enforce lockdown unless country war. illegal government meddle Swedish CDC handles pandemic. Ministerial rule public agencies forbidden since 1680. So, yeah, pretty old law guess? :) dig grave well? think might need read article posted closely. here’s another article info you’re interested. Don’t get wrong, physician who’s also medically high risk, nobody wants work me. it’s important realistic expectations it’ll available.  guess ones Glastonbury Festival last ones use really need go can't make nicer ones (the portacabins flush). get get quickly can. Lol.  suggested fine mask back March can't believe hate got Fucker Yeah, that’s good point. wonder cards humanity people holiday hole again...  subsidy around $50 per tourist, $100 stay 5 nights.

I imagine tourists spent lot there. However point view tourism, getting travel paid nice little incentive.

Tourism makes around 18% Thai GDP, hard understate important is. Wasn’t debunked? thought another article said American updated German. American now? heard friend LaCrosse whole dorm building basically tested positive Furthermore care, genuinely give fuck 200,000 people dead  Sweden tested 1,78 per 1000 living Sweden. Finland tested 1,53 per 1000. Norway 2,02 Denmark 5,67. Sweden middle number tests performed. 

1,78 personer per tusen invånare dagligen Sverige första veckan september, att jämföra med 1,53 Finland, 2,02 Norge och 5,67 Danmark. way Sweden Florida? 

And 3700 people used faulty covid tests imported China well-known well reported, something can't said every country. Hope keep living dream world statistics relied gives ability use technology gives voice even it’s rubbish. Take someone who's back end strict second lockdown, 28 days get done. 700 cases day, nothing like US has, still struggle. welcome. Also, may add sense great amount wisdom within words. world could learn lot feel. seems absurdly stupid even conversation still wondering ""is safe return schools?""

No. Absolutely not. every possible angle god damn , fucking safe.

 could anyone possibly think opening windows wearing masks using bit hand sanitizers would make freaking  closed , poorly ventilated , full kids several hours environment safe?? airlines helping ""No refunds"" phase 3 trial

No not, in_PA Problem is, US recognise body backed China this.

Just look pulled middle pandemic - study would trust one conducted administration, hardly independent. covid? didn’t covid, infect anybody. country-wide, Australia enormous geographically compared Israel. /r/COVID19Positive want see absolutely true. Feel sorry folk dealing w along w morons calling pain fake. article far indepth: take one cause fews english found. forgot bliss modern translation software So? doesn’t make impossible even difficult, best it’s challenge. works, large groups people specialized backgrounds figure details. make sound like 650M doses delivered December. Pfizer knows you. DOD knows you. NIAID knows you. vaccine, approved, begin administered December despite ridiculous sanctimonious negativity. 

And way, freezer farms already continue manufactured. literally pictures internet. There’s also specialized boxes designed Pfizer hold vaccine appropriate temperature intended locations. lockdowns political

you're saying Chinese ""sacrificed"", literally, sacrificed 10 mln people city (manhattan 2 mln) appease dems destroy Trump's reelection? 5d chess Placebo doesn’t mean doesn’t anything. could well given placebo physiological effects noticeable side effects. example many studies psychedelics, niacin used placebo physiological effects similar effects felt “come up” LSD. 

The goal placebo make person getting completely unable tell received not... seems working that’s got. Lol country small. places done second regional lockdowns needed go country-wide ie Australia 100% OA means air recycled. no, filters really need get changed. many climates though, hvac system designed recycle air can't keep heating/cooling 100% oa [This exactly much fuck give opinion me, bro.](http://nothing.com/)  actually faith PFE deliver working vaccine. Trump seem bed execs rush something FDA unacceptable burden known issues. MRNA vaccine coming nowhere near me. CCP propaganda farm work btw?

Turns Asia knew fuck doing.

They went SARS-1.

The notion westerners, even moment, instinct except sudden urge immediately copy everything (democratic) Asia response Covid-19 insane.

The world moved immediately copy Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, even Japan. response flawless, Asia much ahead USA shameful. Sometimes know I’m getting right back car, like driving one store another, leave mask touch again. moved Bismarck. maddening . weird sort exile new place want visit places meet people/ make friends ethically really able to. Meanwhile neighbors anyone happen chat getting groceries whatever think I'm crazy taking seriously.  Death least worries. Getting covid surviving life ruining side effects ruined heart destroyed lungs makes worried. sure, let's let run rampant again. locals parting hard, government says covid free guy eat factory canteen full thousands people, idea better place dine. smart ideas? b! Sarcasm difficult read text. Lol!! gotta joking. article says works hotel. sarcastic. agree can't say 400 people insufficient without information. People silly. I’m confused, people saying COVID doesn’t exist? anti-maskers act violently towards essentiall workers, store restaurants owners every right report authorities arrested charged assault destroing private property point facing 20 40 years prison ordered pay 5 hundred thousand dollar fine. Don’t persuade me, I’m Young people old knocking everyone ass (fatigue, chest pain, body aches) worst part one knows stays forever like HIV does. 

Don't listen government humanities gravest threat right even climate change. Welp. wildfires classroom can’t open widows since AQI currently 400+ anyway, there’s ventilation system speak of. Increasing viral load participations contaminating shit building held hahahahahaha protests people distancing wearing mask, BLM protests Manchester streets full cause spike. seems transmittable outdoors. markup supply chain. Mask price doubled Covid hit many hospitals (not all) weren’t willing take cost on. 

It starts supply chain, sourcing quality materials pass niosh ratings first problem, getting actual masks made like 3M / moldex others secondary issue limited facilities produce them. 

As always, shortage causes bidding wars buy price it’s available. higher price didn’t fit within budgets hospitals frontline facilities weren’t willing pay , instead opted reuse buy lower grade masks. 

We ended servicing many smaller private practices needed since companies like U-Line Medline would service pre existing customers volume already. They'd need national level act quickly stop local flare ups. national level even would require complete cooperation 50 state governments too. like 50 small countries. stop farming animals OK? Delay, delay, bang!  you’re talking US, certainly locking states insane leadership. That’s weekly unemployment number decreasing rather swiftly FL CA shows number higher FL, TX AZ combined. Also school reopening shows 80% attendance rate now, people want go back work/school given choice. California went second lockdown economic data dire, virus hasn’t stopped spreading either, virus curve FL. Data clearly shows lockdown worse impact virus since July,

Edit: Oh Czech, don’t know. data suitable US, small number countries benefit strict lockdown, hopefully leader pick best choice base good understanding Czech culture, legal systems, etc. Yikes! bit much there, certainly like shit church pulls (been side thier shenanigans personally)

But feels bit much. Good points. Permanent lockdown new normal. data crystal clear this. anything makes feel better Fauci conservative shit job means it’s probably earlier get economy would ruined, whose economy ruined right now? Also, good famine economy? mean effects Irish famine lasted lot longer famine lasted. deal famine-stricken countries? africans gonna wait LOOOOOOOOONG time.

Hope guys get mess soon, stay safe ! Yes I'm sure mask save people die due cancer therapy stopped, able get early diagnosis diseases people scared go hospital suffering heart problems. Lets tell wear mask!!! least non profit status revoked. accurate might be? UK nutshell. Sell profit outsource make someone else's problem. National Add Zero every Fine Act. Maybe add two Zeroes even, hell, even three Zeroes. Make fines capable instantly destroying companies dare step line.  starting get colder North. states screwed. something brought coworkers went meetings return back work driving Motorcoach. systems vehicles bring fresh air suck old air, run filters rated capture Covid airborne pathogens. matters people wear damn mask.  visit salon mask usage strictly enforced, odds much favor. one case Missouri, two infected hairstylists cut 139 people’s hair masks on, nobody became make sure insist precautions taken, ideally avoid situations multiple customers present close proximity one time. Getting real tired stupid people. whether *current* plan working? Seems like obvious choice long protect vulnerable. 2nd. Read article Public whippings Party USA laughed watched video beginning sermon, listed restrictions like...Among was:

""No offering baskets"" ""hey guys hosting get together house police raided home reason whatsoever. Wont help fight injustice donating go fund me.""

Him probably Honestly don’t see “too alarmist” thing coming from. USA never legally enforced lockdown vast majority country. never stopped anyone traveling. never mass testing required people legally quarantine. never closed many nonessential businesses. parts country people still refuse wear masks, especially outside situations specifically asked so. 

We uncontrolled community spread. city 200k people coronavirus cases last 24 hours New Zealand (5 million people) last 6 months.

Seems like people didn’t panic enough.

But answer question view things way preconceived ideas pandemic exaggerated media. article statistics every point made could applicable data set current plague. k told us derived 2003 vaccine. Give us details. That's plain true. Lockdowns cost people jobs. People need money food table roof head. mention, US, health insurance. Might get job Tesco /s Again, I’m defending industry; simply stating corporation harms employees, consumers, environment held high consequences sway items again. Prison time trickle-down ""it is""

seriously, president governors guy wears mask nose around neck

this country become Great business decision, funerals profitable. may know everything Pfizer may something pipeline. We're full deep second surge every night see people parks socializing without masks.

There requirement wear mask then. Oh sick world days private property destructive. Oh I'm aware based many many bans. Hiding truth never answer. Good noodle

This hilarious. exactly what’s going here. Well done. troll  Gota make money  long takes. damage done lockdowns. anything saves lives less people dying traffic accidents communicable diseases.

Maybe lock stop well. amount death acceptable. idea virus deadly. correct *cough cough* believe may answer question end semester. Climate change says hello thing is, halfhearted half-reopening low-drone-of-COVID-cases thing, we’ll stuck purgatory years. Half full restaurants aren’t viable, nothing long term stability service industry.

If everyone actually *did thing* long enough stop spread, could reopen safely lot confidence. Like places around planet doing.

“We need jobs survive?” completely agree. way save jobs lasting meaningful way *solve underlying problem*, shrug pretend doesn’t exist. Time another big boost sex tourism saved economy before, demand high real soon. likely get boost remote work, surging divorce numbers across globe, that’s one area airline companies want focus well shortly pandemic, air travel hit hard traveling sex won’t, could see huge boost recent events. bother read edit? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* way. anything saves people dying traffic. wear mask! go value life. Call someone video call need social interaction. I'm boomer. Gen-X here. 

And way hermit. rough taco Tuesday Yup. said, also get front line workers high risk people shots first, general public probably access couple months. Going projection Oct/Nov getting all-clear, I'd say early 2021 (January/Februaray) reasonable, tad optimistic timeline general public access tot vaccine.

Plus, overlap flu season gonna gum delivery networks. infrastructure manufacturing distribution already there, millions shots ready go ain't gonna help enough people administer timely manner. there's probably going decent backlog. Tragically, simple.

A significant portion workforce developing nations works agriculture, that's economy based around.

If sudden developed nation starts dumping excess food developing nation free, basically wipes existing local agricultural economy, leads sorts issues.

In addition distribution food aid sorts political issues attached cause variety unintended really sad, right, really simple ""Hey, let's give giant piles excess food people food way get eat fill landfills garbage instead."" This. don’t care think won’t work. duty help public get board it. added fuel fire. long willing lock then? 9 months? year? certain point damage lengthy national lockdown outweighs damage virus do. whole business model killing many beings fast possible. Stop eating meat (or start eating less first) help eliminate completely godless, inhumane, horrific industry. seldom see American needs pork chops anyways. 

The environment thank us it! also huge loss revenue staff gets sick shut down, sooooo God sinophobia sub insane Literally every state downwind California constant state contact high. Truth. people exist cases countries too. isn’t American thing, people focus America global position world opposed countries. Flu season = worth it, open windows wear masks filter smoke. Oh wait murder hornets fly in, close windows. like eating leave cheese this, cheese innocent. hope Big Blockbuster Superhero movies (especially Marvel's) go fashion Nice CDC withhold results July study everyone gone back school... Devil’s advocate - kids staying home protect teachers. teachers putting kids childcare would normally in. long teach classroom safely, bad? 

My experience everyone remote (and trying teach kids work full time spring) teachers basically MIA. Could good reasons this, model definitely didn’t work, least young kids.

I don’t fault teachers questioning whether it’s worth it, systemic failure, kids really ones hurt this. Wave 2 come Calculations based made numbers uncredible non regulated website.

That's get tested playing since wide variety plans situation evolved, seems pretty silly blame current plan.

Most excess deaths locked still thought surface contact primary means spread experts tv saying wear mask

As fining anti-maskers suddenly question making take public health class little late.

I'm pretty sure forced unpaid labor drastically needed, especially even tried non-Gulag methods. 4th article morning Pfizer. check share's price growth, see smallest percentage increase compared vaccine race companies. Someone payed potentially good news. teachers start volunteering put PPE going COVID rooms much less risk? One political parties went insane longer interested governing (in sense helping people). large media ecosystem dedicated running cover them. narrative getting better.  Canonically yes, engineer research (“science”) unknown many colleagues degrees medicine/physics/math/chemistry/etc aren’t “engineers” applications based industry fits exact problem-solving definition engineering. Many engineers field hold positions like Senior Scientist Data Scientist applications, research. engineers, use science. Sorry rant, don’t really like distinction. Underrated comment community service work country. read article. Debate healthy welcomed Australia talking debate here, talking people deliberately breach health orders effect specifically protection public.
It one city within Australia, Covid19 cases exploded health system weeks away overrun, action taken public overwhelmingly supports action.
The public dictated small, vocal unruly minority happy put collective welfare jeopardy, one arrested disagreeing government one ever country. Would stop antivaxxer rhetoric! mean ever bothered actually find “ingredients” vaccines? think it’s always best study thing opening ones big mouth, regardless whether ones’ fellow ninnies agree. seem think everyone accent equal 'weight' depends hear not.

I'm sure heard someone strong southern accent someone weaker southern accent. agree heard accents equal weight, rather spectrum. take person weak southern accent make weaker, make weaker still, accent ultimately end continue process? Wish they’d US, especially stupid fucking dipshits went sturgis. 

Unfortunately, grave digging would probably kill people US due obesity &amp; heart problems, mention fuckboi wanna-be militiaman who’d show ARs &amp; barely fitting army vests crying tyranny accept consequences &amp; punishment it’s happening poor brown people. Forced community service without pay slavery opinion? then? word would use describe laborous job unpaid forced do? 

Because I'm pretty sure slavery fits bill (unless willing argue cotton picking 19th century community service well).  Sounds like anxiety attack Can' read article due paywall. 

Anyway, really understand sharing happend detail justifying data privacy.

What data privacy, anonymous person trial? Yes, sound right, least me. hole. Autocorrect hates apparently.  government function correctly would always work better good democracy

That's like saying race car powerful engine always faster one good brakes suspension.

Evidently drag race, powerful engine ability get power matter; constantly surging forward struggling change direction hit wall, well twisty course.

Worse, authoritarian regimes create incentive leaders assume authoritarian role - benevolence Singapore generally usurped less benevolent, restrictive ruler. even authoritarianism successful tries do, tries often actively harmful interests country vs. narrow leadership cadre. whole what? Another joined-up government policy working well then...    mandate wearing mask would fall rule law, no? sound like something old 6th grade homeroom teacher would do, lmao. He's lying, pest antilockdown right wing people say lockdown longest world national lockdown. example, province already begun site classes subreddit r/argentina full whackos like one. I’d best stay away u/oldfrenchwhore too. Especially covid Standard Canadian English... like excerpt article says... helps you, consider relationship Ultraorthodox Jews ethnically Jewish people similar Evangelical Christians people name Christopher. Somehow find oddly satisfying. Maybe fur stays infected would amazing. If.. F .. vaccine developed trump's presidency, might swing election back trump's favour unfortunately.. trump gna take credit vaccine cult followers regard god Lockdown first step put hotspot, followed mandantary quarantine travelling people high risk areas, mass testing contact tracing.

The national scale lockdown China actually long, compared countries retrospect. Good point. last lockdown resulted everyone crowding supermarkets shops day hopefully 5 days notice, adherence social distancing. 

Hopefully upcoming holidays ones people enjoy safely covid mind. Sounds like rough time  Wyoming actually big issue. Well, ok, medically trained way, also wondering possible rule vaccine cause neurological syndrom fast?

All found real cause disease, commom viral infections. So, cause, got vaccine happened. sure safe continue days happened?

I pushing theory, simply understand part. Trump fans literally killing LEOs wont mask US government recognize it, subset idiots Reddit brainwashed kneejerk ""China bad"" every time see anything related country SAY believe it, tell people like /u/sttevenindavalley actually believe it, even want admit it. really hope works, even rest us (EU), wait longer. USA needs anyway. Even mask recommendations social distancing guidelines? seems completely idiotic.  lying.

What sources claim? seemingly impossible someone understand them, yet people stubborn selfish. disease passed air people relatively neaby. 6’ maybe little depending air currents. Okay, logic says you’re near people wear mask. people think it’s inconvenient infringing personal freedoms. 

So people die. cruel unusual make people face wrong doings. easy line draw - flippant passing deadly disease help dig graves people helped kill. Seems logical me. think mean ~~not~~ getting away ~~any~~things. love animals. taste great!


I thought gonna picture black dude massive schlong something astounding thoughts arise try imagine situations might occurred make rule. im lost insane world ofc tasty... know many tourists like take photos next thingy :)
we get lot frowns vegans people love animals :)

probably would interested hear *thought* :D long would wait trial vaccine, Covid circulating population, damaging people's health directly (actual cases leading long-term symptoms deaths) indirectly (taking focus cancer care, cardiology, mental health, etc., also shrinking economy, reducing resource pool healthcare causing resurgence poverty-related health issues?) people exposed small doses? apply masks used instead social distancing? Misleading title.. There's lot reasons watching home better watching theaters QLED/OLED Atmos setup (which expensive days middle class). 

It's actually price cheaper math watching two three people. massively expensive loner.

The number people boycotting very, small impact it, press generated may actually give increased marketing movie. 

Look Chris Brown's record sales tried kill Rhianna.

It half well Tenet domestically opening weekend bad family movie.

The real problem plot character development god-awful appeal westerners appeal Chinese. vaccine virus longer present population.  [Taiwan, Finland, Norway, democracies, low case numbers little negative cost economy. 

Sure, authoritarians positive things quickly efficiently, unfortunately history shows us also horrific things quickly efficiently. IIRC 90% Canadian population lives nearer equator average inhabitant Seattle.

EDIT: remembered wrong, t's 72% live south 49th. apologies, right India. realize part US waiver exception despite dedollarisation.

Yes, INSTEX far complete success, clear indication EU willingness ""decouple"" US become prevalent past couple year.

China indeed one standing up.  die, die. literally thought meant parks stuff still planning party’s couple week

I hate people repeat George Carlin quote “Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that,"" lot people repeating realize side divide fall on.

But again, seems particularly apt here; relation family, across wider population.

Hell, family planning birthday party family member 70s. fact, he's one who's planning it. mother, shielding July (and 60s, healthy, overweight), planning go even though would rules live. know they're stupid, either concept household bubbles complex, they've decided good reasons break law way people 34 30. love “Have got flag?” Party like 1999 Ask anyone China they'll know Global Times tabloid newspaper.

&amp;#x200B;

I know got around foreigners keep saying Global Times tabloid newspaper, Global Times international news paper sponsored published People's Daily.

&amp;#x200B;

""The People's Daily official newspaper Central Committee Communist Party China representative media Communist Party China.

&amp;#x200B;

A tabloid? 60% time, I’m right everytime! OP's mental leap farther even distance earth sun. incredible. underground cabal dudes

It's called CIA. mean feel bad people. get it, everyone super lonely. People miss families friends. new general advice means larger contexts avoided several people meet, parties, weddings events. also important people keep distance one another at, example, sports venues, gyms, shopping malls, public transport Sweden able work home continue throughout autumn, continuation guideline place since mid-March. 

Mask mandate aside, Sweden's approach basically 'lock down' restrictions many countries employing. difference Swedes seem socially responsible compliant, even authorities crack bars/restaurants following social distancing guidelines. twice deadly flu general.  OK goanna surprised this... also wear glasses. wear mask. Dang. now? louder guys hang people upside still? trying stop NY. It’s really hard though.

/s eating animals caused ups hoard animals test vaccines prevent spread viruses animals?   sure want open that...

Edit thought. Looks tasty. Maybe I’m hungry tho America FOXNEWS anymore?  people thick assholes.

Says person thinks laborous pseudo-slavery adequate punishment, not...you know? Peaceful education? 

Y'all even care science, encouraging satisfy thirst frontier justice.  agree. 

Also. 50% time I'm right 100% time. look OSHA code - citation right there. actual entry little specific, metric units well. Yeah probably won’t around ... think different view vaccine safety. hope goes well Russia, concerns. lot teachers near retirement age getting there, families. teachers immune system much weaker child’s immune system, isn’t true child would category one since high risk. Repeat me: USA! USA! USA! asked shut fine issued police ignored, abused back called. It’s right article. worn mask perfectly?

It's even hard wtf incorrect. people basically accent would tie region. Here's bit Kubrick attracted Mr. Rain role partly actor “had kind bland mid-Atlantic accent felt right part,” said 1969 interview Mr. Gelmis. Mr. Rain’s accent isn’t mid-Atlantic all; it’s Standard Canadian University Toronto linguistics professor Jack Chambers explained: “You computer sounds like he’s nowhere, or, rather, specific place. Standard Canadian English sounds ‘normal’ — that’s Canadians well received United States anchormen reporters, vowels don’t give away region come from.”

Tell me, accent voice actor HAL have? selfish don’t Support lockdowns killing grandma  Actually no, that’s true. laws far restrictive US. sure you’re pulling from?

For example, UK doesn’t concept free speech. People assume they’re ignorant actually held personally criminally liable words UK way never could US. could add 0 200k I’m sure reaction America would difference agree it, like anti-maskers I'm gonna force partake laborous jobs punishment.

You really think gonna anything satisfy Reddit's bloodlust frontier justice? Look, live Italy, saw things get virus gets control... Thousands people died many died someone respect rules infected/got people infected... lost people know ""not respecting rules"" early stages virus assure you, lives, every single life 35000 died here, much worthy 10.000 dollars. 

If price pay someone understand he's God putting risk others well, need pay. care pay debt, human lives saved making pay amount, correct make pay.  still high quality, long term peer reviewed studies find comprehensively show long term effects COVID across board test positive admitted hospital.

Until outcome studies produced, claims anecdotal speculation doctors see myocarditis certain cases.

This Coronavirus also unusual able infect heart cells Influenza also produces acute myocarditis even asymptomatic, less dangerous cases. Influenza also known increase clotting factors blood lead heart attacks unique Coronavirus either.

Sorry know embed: Doesn’t bible section pray worship pandemic? IMO needs test voting too, one repeatable (with different questions) people improve order vote. way keep R number 1 lockdown measures basically vaccine released. destroy economy completely. country seems making good go New Zealand far everywhere else (and still community transmission). completely, NZ basically 'resurgence' single digit daily cases. Singapore done well containing community cases too, seen multiple days zero community cases. Malaysia also, albeit slight uptick days ago, seems contained thus far.

Lock downs months seem like they'll work better countries long run, since they've basically re-opened without much issue. also makes contact tracing *much* easier community cases mitigating spread irresponsible persons cause ignoring social distancing guidelines. Well, people doesnt wear masks backyard somebody might sneeze direction viruses hang air so, still risk get infected backyard.

No arbitrary, no, making person dig grave isnt sadistic punishment. punishment, sadisti one. clearly dont know sadist is. every punisher labeled sadist, world would bad place. people deserve punishment, walk around among humans, never wearing mask wearing chin mouth. isnt hard, cover nose it, especially among humans helping virus spread probably, contribution others, kill somebody. Thats make dig grave, least dig grave one caused death. honestly could worded better myself. Y'all actually advocating slavery holy shit. would get 400+ pound hambeasts dig grave? might heart attack rushed vaccine, sure hope safe people need vaccine. Well say Ontonario, that’s pretty obvious tell. person right here, officer. He's thinking shareholders knew make accountable every medical problem death may came Minnesotan here...so, think really got shot Canada? I've saying bit, four years kinda crazy ruin event I'm really hoping Canada sees officially bringing th State Hockey fold lol.

I kid, love country... Hurts seeing getting jumped able more. Basen what? Ok see problems there... includes anywhere near people. backyard rural? front porch really stoop 3’ neighbor’s? context specific, yes. biggest factor is: people close enough might catch whiff someone’s perfume? Wear it. 

How hard get? need sign copy me! proudly display book mantle!  deliberately infect many could. thought healthy whole life. actions position ignorance different time medical advancement. I'm saying innocent little complicated deliberately infected many Interesting doc her. without extreme cost, tbf.

Melbourne trying similarly, whilst many see end goal definitely causing rifts. Rifts part stirred media, social media, political parties tbf less divisive China - due there's one party, controls above. good thing that, think people make mistake assuming carries benefits, unwise underestimate way imo. Wow one women.

Even 100 sources, 100 people millions recovered? Outliers always exist every illness planet. Yeah, seems like great way make people angry real benefit. two infectious diseases successfully eradicated: smallpox rinderpest. one affected humans. There’s perfect vaccine virus disease never vaccine everyone it. People like crazy. sometimes leave errands tape nose bridge prevent glasses fogging it’s easier retaping get next destination.  really. various anti-lockdown anti-mask protests Italy, Spain, France, Switzerland, UK Germany.

There differences, though:

1. empowered stupidity elected representatives. Macron never asked liberate Marseille. Merkel never suggested ingesting bleach. Boris never proposed UV enemas.

2. scale. found anything like Sturgis taking place Europe. gatherings cultural events, 250k people? Mostly un-masked?

3. Europe actually got control time. US control since March. double-edged sword, life could get back somewhat normal, also bred complacency. seems like everywhere now, people forgot pandemic. I'm Seattle people assume progressive people good it. However seems opposite. I'd say maybe half folks wear masks social distancing definitely hit miss. Even hazardous pollution due wildfires amazing see damn near amount maskless folks. keep wondering going take, also, want really know. I've lost friend COVID others long haulers. one wants stuck can't simply wear masks cooperate collectively feel like going last much longer point. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

What experiencing Australians happy right thing interest collective good/health community. Protesting (or breaking rules) moment running counter hard work everyone else doing. insult hardships rest us suffered past months.  Im displaying side youre saying, see seems like basic misunderstanding here. Slavery is when done nothing wrong held and work for no pay. Community service, while punishment, is a form of making giving back society for any wrong crime committed.   Trump polling like 43% Minnesota Minnesota looking like swing state now.

Also 800 cases still Canada. hell no. hundreds thousands us made redundant. Also, always amazed knowledge warm human explaining approach thinking Queen make knight something. honestly love videos, explained well scientifically backed up. thing talking bad data good studies. read least two words title. virus extinct absolutely perfect vaccine absolutely everyone it, quarantine don’t island. 

Nobody ever died losing job. died virus though. think North America follow suit. Canada needs this.  Canada generally isn't. tried sneak lie way in. point border staying closed vaccine thing. Cause opening would cause massive backlash. thought people caught virus needed hooked ventilators breathe them? least that's media said. No, read comments, playjng videos tv, said it, check sure. spotted happening right first cnbc dw interviews. Plus, always saying videos nurse, announce doctor, anonymous before, main media crazy him. reddit seems forget Singapore explosion cases 2/3 months ago, ppl ignorant af thought Americans allowed visit Germany? Ugly American alive well. Brain go brr we're stupid :/ is, maybe trade-off worthwhile. think we’re quoted one strictest lockdowns, can’t sure it’s one longest considering many US states stay home orders since Feb. I’m happy corrected! 

But sincerely believe long be. Politically hard even lock long have, know they’re flippantly. It’s grating difficult it’s black white - steps increasing intensity lockdown steps well. Already today they’ve eased restrictions outdoor meetups, playgrounds forming social bubbles singles - bit carrot hopefully get us stick rules little longer drive cases down. pretty much overnight like weeks ago. HCQ+ herd immunity name - suddenly. read YT comments? must get him. conspiracy nut would say government making people dig fema camp graves something along lines sound like symptoms? Starting Friday sneezing sore throat, last last night I'm coughing much feeling need cough. Canadian accent sounds similar mid-atlantic accent, mid-atlantic accent especially common USA. acccent used upper classes therefore bit visibilty, certainly norm. guess conplains visible one involved. Within europe tons stereotypes tourists. Germans cant dress (socks abd sandals), drop towels everywhere claim pool beach spots complain time, french rude arrogant Brits pretty much drunk barbarians.
I guess know bit exaggerated cause visit least european countries. least im aware us tourist worse prejudice others hasn’t mandatory wearing masks except public transportation capital planes Norway. see government reluctant introducing it, like everywhere else expect pushback might get politicized. many people stop wearing protest effectiveness becomes questionable. really need get everyone onboard social distancing, hand hygiene, stay home ill, limit traveling also. Masks one part it. Behave like IDIOT? Enjoy consequences, MORON! Maybe realize Pandemic killing people! Absolutely agree. Lots Europeans pickup accents watching movies. must help learn / exposed English Germans went infected (the rate still low, chance infected travelling pretty low) came back infected... I’m Philadelphia read we’re 95% compliant mask wearing. husband also compromised leaves house dr appointments I’m vigilant masks hand sanitizer I’m out. shop go work. That’s it, since mid March. comforting see masks everywhere one thing greatly upsets mask wearers nose exposed. won’t interact people come across cashiers wear nose. I’ll leave store I’ve words Lowe’s cashier. rude didn’t reply nice day remark told adjust mask got loud. walked away upset. 

So, we’re great Philly exceptions. feel safe also limit excursions. slavery apparently abolished US... Yes? slavery supposed banned? Even prisoners? Americans traveling EU usually uneducated Walmart hillbillies. many EU ppl throw 1 bin actually elaborate point argument? one point, Nazis, Germans too, generalized.

I open minded friends spend maybe little much time Facebook. Kazakhstan. Yes, second national lockdown much? wonder revolted. 90% lol Lol nah, subbed. made one post identify giant spider friend. Otherwise spiders outs. Lefties love mock conservatives anti-vaxxers, they're anti-vax think they're justified big pharma Trump involved (actually, Trump really). Never mind there's upside pharma companies driving stock see crash wind killing people bad vaccine. like people understand stock markets employee option plans work all. States got anything? know works England, English. think confused. “Russia offered us production vaccines **by Indian companies** Phase 3 trials India. government India attaches great importance offer partnership special friend nation. win-win situation us. fronts significant progress. **Some companies touch manufacturing.** regulatory aspect, Indian scientists looked paved way Phase 3 bridging studies facilitated spirit partnership, science humanity,” Paul said. Americans fucking stupid? Read replies comment, dumbass. countries complaining clueless, headblind American tourists decades, though. Admittedly, patent it, we're pretty bad group. least visible. Take heart, friend. many world’s best minds working it, certainly get vaccine works least 50% rolling next year.

50% efficacy + long take reach 70% population vaccinated mean especially risk severe complications Covid need continue public health protocols even vaccinated themselves. 

But healthy, things begin close normal end next year, according Dr Fauci, consider conservative estimate. There’s concern news successful vaccine cause increase risky behavior would cause huge spike cases prior time vaccine mass distributed. reason, makes sense guarded information provided public. nation state matters rights responsibilities circumstance. probably listen scientists regardless nationality. going run scientists anyways approval, waiting countries rather arbitrary. going die. Society never go back normal. Climate change destroy planet. Pizza hut bring big Dipper back Canada. happy now? may bot. probably dumb ppl. tend say unoriginal things. Definition accent wikipedia: ""an **accent** manner pronunciation peculiar particular individual, location, nation"". Therefore, individual accent, even neuter, ""accent"" means ""the way someone speaks"".

Then, pleople strong accent bland one maybe able pinpoint exactly from, everybody one.

And, even then, fact can't tell someone come based way speaking (or accent) mean trained linguist able tell either. think biggest fear right (other obvious vote mail thing) post-covid 19 may shift rhetoric media organizations regarding covid-19, politicizing issue already is. fear shift tone shortly election (on sides), gonna end well US response. unironically, 100% favour this. obvious. seem completely unaware Pfizer taken taxpayer money invested $1.5bn production research risk. deal sell doses US government fixed price get paid success. really, know, read things. Almost every american met abroad easy talk kind! actually learned lot small talk, country totally thing, love ice breaker instead awkward silence. 

I think rep americans get right handle corona virus, personalities. happens everywhere, country big everything much larger scale Spain France might next candidates lockdown. Daily numbers rise 15.000 week. question ""when exponential rise start""? embrassment. barely enforce curfews time, said get 1000 cases per day got 4000. yes; i'm one objective reality important, apologies offends you. That’s terrible Feb-March? Er, yeah, sure CDC favorite film. Pains say you’re 100% correct, looking FB post reactions content Dr Fauci adequate evidence that. :/ think? Yeah, already believe fda cdc Trump Seems like unnecessary risk, although kind you. think risk probably reasonably low, id suggest opening windows time home needed there, even buying air filter. live, yes, definitely. punishment article far removed existing community service punishments US Courts already dole every single day people like dumb teens getting caught stolen bottle vodka. 

That thing immediate slippery slope [insert post-apocalyptic fantasy slave camp/radium mines/sweatshop] idea is, laughable amateur. Ah, one those. Carry friend. Placer County 15 minutes Sacramento 2 hours San Francisco. predict many outsiders flocking Placer County includes Lake Tahoe.  spreading ""no choice, false choice rhetoric"".

Face it, actually part problem. referenced vaccines miracle cures problem.  made, course years, feared diseases basically disappear issue US. Probably developed countries also.  

Smallpox got eradicated.  Polio range eradication.  Birth defects due ""german measles"" basically unknown.  Yeah things like mumps measles pop occasionally introduced lesser developed countries still around, get pockets fools vaccinated due irrational stupidity proceed infect unfortunate people happen vulnerable.  hardship easily solved government giving money people rather large corporations.

This extremely naive. Firstly, personally support ""bailouts"" large companies anyway. Loans would fair support industries period, especially national interest.

And lockdowns quarantines cause economic damage. Looking -10% GDP Europe average, countries hitting -20%.

Nobody saying testing contact tracing. we're saying luckily virus deadly people free make risk assessments.  know. mean teachers absolutely get paid more. 100% agree (as teacher, also, attract talent profession. need want capture best brightest) really think teachers paid poorly, they?

I mean, feel like can't complain much many adults still living minimum wage. get pension retire many professions can't claim. get less three months vacation year, want make money, side hustle reality two-three months work. paid 12 months work, would probably making around 60k respectable salary Kansas. I'll making 60 k regardless 10 years master's. Yes, fuck money least I'm at, can't complain. Granted, think could much worse certain states (namely Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi, etc.) also realize 60k livable wage California New York teachers also get paid understanding. know much though. He’s talking putting thick filter HVAC ducts, stand-alone air purifier. air pass ducts, slow ducts putting thick filter, something give. It’s republican talking points shifted. Notice nobody complaining Obama Care anymore? checked /r/COVID19positive ? AstraZeneca made 2 billion doses already what’s hold up. Well successful business, lockdown haven’t gone yearly holiday, yeah spare🤣  think mean deaf ears.. soon dead ears anyway Hope best; prepare worst might best way put (despite cliche) However think understand pessimism Fox News sophisticated propaganda history. mean exponential fear compliance absolutely nothing suggests viable long term immunity, know better, making unfounded statements matter-of-fact. Neither country healtcare systems overwhelmed Sweden several thousand dead Denmark not. 

sweden healthcare system overwhelmed bother treat vulnerable; outright scarificed people care homes, putting morphine nothing else died thousands. Damn really go back restrictions people really caring long hospitals full weak people die.  conservative virus denier anything like think there’s credence idea “go away” come election time Biden wins.

I think wins media cut back fear reporting people generally less anxious perception better hands. shift “hunker down” message “recovery” mindset. Swedish herd immunity specialists nationalists gonna field day: good authority youtube video man pickup truck wearing wraparound shades corona virus globalist hoax replace constitution Sharia-communism No. not.

You choosing isn’t worth cost. different jumping bridge don’t want break legs.

If really wanted violate law, could go massive debt fines, could spend week jail choice. still choose it, becomes worth you. juice worth squeeze. downvote me? 4 times more, it’s 3.5x.

It’s like can’t write anything Sweden without downvoted. Introvert here, too, I'm fraying edges 6 months isolation. sort missing point.

NYC reason lockdown (rapidly rising cases needed brought down). San Francisco done well *able* lockdown large percentage workers WFH. rest California locked quickly realized unsustainable, opened fast, saw cases/deaths like rest country. San Francisco never lockdown though, impose restrictions crowds/masks. Look country. We're able keep cases growing much mild restrictions March. keep R0 1 far fewer restrictions. low number cases, that's that's needed.

Lockdowns go beyond necessary control virus used reduce case counts. desperately need FBI intervention.  longer thing goes, looking like: Outdoor activity = almost totally fine, wear masks cannot socially distance. Indoor activity masks remain 100% time = risk probably okay, try avoid unless necessary limit amount time. Indoor activity masks come point time = unsafe, shut down. Also, mass gatherings kind.

This gets us would consider ""temporary new normal"" lot things open compared March/April far away pre-covid. sampling criteria random. didn’t specifically sample people eaten restaurants screening requirement, it’s random sample. thing coming US November guess. Yet conspiracy wackos see anything here. wife likes teaching 2 year degree state path certification without four year degree. until/if finishes degree gets remedied state subs. got 5-6 years full-year long term assignment experience belt, still makes minimum sub pay here. could something else income situation fortunately let's enjoys low pay. also lets us opt person assignments semester. Complete lack compassion life. FFS, yes work ways.

smh. virus causing called conservative media. lived years 1 BR spouse plus dog. 450 sqft. fine. help many Americans seem take perverse pride shitty obnoxious around possible. think got coal-rollers here? Exponential growth. Dead? thing 2% death rate. I'm going die COVID. mental health going kill rate. life ruined shit. You’d surprised. Lots confederate flags Prairies Yep. feel sorry people. realize they're indirectly responsible almost 200k deaths. I'm glad did. Given CDC longer receiving testing numbers, I'd say reported case numbers unreliable political reasons Eat rich vaccination. size numbers actually matter, rate spread. Anyway Netherlands passing US number daily infections per million week. never argued masks. Kind hard point. hard data european agencies corrupt? qualitative analysis thing hind brained fuck. intelligent person look pressure exerted trump administration change reporting practices, change testing criteria, declare convalescent plasma cure without data backing claim, constantly shift charge reporting numbers draw conclusion regarding corruption without running fucking regression analysis. Demanding hard data everything make smart, makes ass. don’t think it’s entirely political, think hopes prayers glitch psychology. need change think day day basis overcome it, change political beliefs. call knife? *This* knife! *pulls bayonet* it’s realistic might make indoor classes safe, it’s realistic indoor classes vaccine mass distributed. people believe 

But wait isn’t hoax? never felt depressed before. whole body feels numb. Anything sends crying fit. Slovakia currently 2th wave... people getting stupider ever. Almost 30% want wear mask, lot people think hoax. *facts* regarding transmission hospital? observation personnel, doctors, nurses, way line jobs attention detail care.

If masks needed, doubt allow objectors pollute air. point trying make? realistic cities. parks near restaurants less distanced restaurants think misunderstanding point. think reasonable business survive pandemic-level disruption indefinitely. understand insane unprecedented time.

My problem we're prioritizing saving corporations actual people losing jobs homes. large corporations, particularly airlines example, spent decades pushing fiscally irresponsible strategies try maximize short term gains. business collapsing executives get enjoy luxurious golden parachutes funded taxpayer money.

Meanwhile, taxpayers, ones funding corporate bailouts, *also* struggling. people got pathetic $1200 cover 6 months expenses. think unbelievable people fall rationalize corporations deserve help regular people ""just needed plan better"" ""should stop lazy go get job"" wish exist. can't deal anymore. $2 bank account. I'm issues school computer POS I'm poor. supposed get student loans god knows coming. isolated. want deal anymore.

EDIT: Apple care poor people. computer (2012 Macbook Pro) fine upgraded Mojave. I'm convinced Apple purpose force buying new computer. people show evidence damage.  seen much way statistics it, however.  pointer would interested seeing data. Honestly, entire White House needs thrown port-a-potty history set fire. attitude, facing reality is. Positive thinking going save you, let alone keep alive store due decades decades contempt indifference Pollyannaish bullshit climate change, contempt indifference Pollyannaish bullshit ultimately responsible pandemic. Literal psychopath whynotboth.jpg Elementary schools Mesa Arizona reopening today. Last week oldest daughter crying teacher told wouldn’t see anymore. youngest. 

We opted stay remote learning everything messed up. Links don’t work. Schedules blank. They’ve become second thought.

Edit: get downvoted? Dude, said it’s problem showed instance fact problem. reports everything knew stay safe. people aren’t perfect. Masks slip, people need eat, ventilation air circulation play role transmission. can’t assure anyone it’s safe instance wasn’t can’t control factors ensured they’re followed without fail. R(t) larger one epidemic spread rise actual overall infection rate. ""it yet"" ""it begun"".

And saw Florida Texas takes month spread wind showing death statistics, upticks infections deaths always start slowly. continue able point uptick deaths next 4-6 weeks wrong. That's one way kill kid off, guess.

Hopes thoughts prayers conservative strategy forever. many cases catch r tip iceberg  They’re sheep thinking vaccine come soon. seen article, won’t enough vaccines 2024 we’ll need wait another two years distribute enough people another two wait see vaccine actually worked. need keep schools closed, wear masks, let essential business function. start thinking opening around 2028, we’re lucky. Sweden tested 1,78 per 1000 living Sweden. Finland tested 1,53 per 1000. Norway 2,02 Denmark 5,67. Sweden middle number tests performed. If/Until finally make universal influenza vaccine, thing science attempting years, make influenza vaccines every year. They're refrigerated.

Here's either last 2009 swine general guideline pediatrics same: Influenza vaccine stored refrigerator temperatures. Many varieties vaccine damaged/destroyed frozen. Note orders discard(trash) get frozen.

CDC document storage handling practices, directed people working medical setting set environment around storage. Includes things like examples: Varicella (chickenpox) vaccine must frozen. MMR frozen refrigerated.
Frozen vaccines go -58F without damage, that's lower bound. upper bound 5F.

All existing vaccine storage systems can't -70F, even -60F. freezers designed make sure drop -58F prevent damage existing vaccines there. There's nothing standard equipment store -70F vaccine. Yeah, phrase ""hope best, prepare worst, expect somewhere between"" comes mind.

According CDC, epidemiological studies found IFR averages around 0.65%, studies finding IFR ranging around 0.3%-1%.

Looking excess death data Mumbai antibody survey IFR 0.2 put excess cases due coronavirus. highly unlikely excess deaths due coronavirus die due hunger caused lockdown , excess suicides due job losses income loss due lockdown , going due hospital due fear coronavirus.

Statistically country big China diverse resources, places advanced others..you can’t promise 0 case transmission. simple comes lying. Hopefully little clear.

South Korea New Zealand lot this. South Korea geographically smaller, bordered nation allow foreigners really, otherwise bordered literal ocean. small contained outbreak.

No, ""they're better"" satisfy equation.

Limited community transmission still ongoing across China. end world. domestic transmission 0.

Listen, maybe China San Marino Liechtenstein could convince happening. China small contained city-state. cannot obtain level community transmission early on.

The majority 737’s 737 next gen. (-600,-700,-800,-900) 7000 stilly flying, mostly them.

Really though, lot less flying going right now, I’m wondering grounded 737-MAX fleet going sit grounded another couple years. know read like ""if country basically fuck can't it, must impossible country manage"" president 4 years.  government doesn’t fund Fox News.  stated facts yes I'm commenting situation Ontario Canada, may apply you.

That said understand situation different us I'm sorry going through. * Austria: daily cases 75% first wave sharply rising

* Belgium: small-ish second wave August, daily cases 40% first wave. 

* Czechia: Daily cases **4 times high** first wave, still sharply rising

* France: Daily cases **70% higher** first still rising

* Netherlands: Daily cases 90% first wave sharply rising

* Poland: first wave pretty steady early April mid-June. July lower. big wave August daily cases almost **twice high** April-June. 

* Portugal: cases never really went low except August, sharply rising, currently 60% first wave

* Romania: Daily cases last month steadily **3.4 times high** first wave

* Spain: Daily cases **20% higher** peak first wave, still rising

* UK: Daily cases 50% first peak, sharply rising yesterday

* Ukraine: Still first wave, still rising

No clear second wave (yet): Germany (though higher June/July), Ireland (though higher June/July), Italy (maybe small second wave), Russia (has slow decline since May, slight uptick), Sweden (their peak late June), Switzerland (though slowly rising since late June) Newsom keeps moving goalpost re-opening things remain closed election. Far success story, helpful data us see ceiling outbreak things start dramatically falling off. wait 2021, 2024, 2025. Come Atlanta today live ""like normal"" . Georgia got Covid-19 waiver 👀 /s article incorrect though. states surge death United States clearly was. reach spring time levels, increase significant basically plateaued 800-1000 day cases plateaued 40,000-45,000. That's concerning we're heading fall winter respiratory virus season. Also holiday season drive spread even more. hope true Europe see increase death, almost certainly will. thing happen United States summer. Deaths lagged month behind resurgence epidemic. Can't second wave first one never ended Lol can’t say something true not. literally show graphs cities/states introduced mask mandates happened cases. Sometimes go up, sometimes go down. didn’t “drastically reduce” anything.

Physics aren’t relevant car crash scenario one suggesting wear masks time like seat belt. fact, would much useful masks worn socialising friends family indoors isn’t law anywhere. 

The mask mandates equivalent telling people wear seatbelts driving 10mph, that’s it’s fine take hit 100mph. Nah Newsom opposite utilitarian. matter 95% deeply harmed 5% slightly better Since fires raging, big testing centers closed. wonder affects numbers? can’t near much testing previous months.  California, it'll likely rise though. spread non-uniform (with high infection rates LosAngeles low infection rates SF bayarea). another rise likely SF BayArea tries open (which likely try soon). wisdom comes free reddit that’s case need plan doesn’t rely vaccine

Not California, goal zero cases improve treatment sure it’s actually think harder population density smooth there's lot interstate travel.

Like beginning covid didnt nationwide lockdown ton Midwestern states almost 0 breakouts still locked anyways. months later coastal population centers got control started experience breakouts, theyre already sick ""unnecessary"" lockdowns. Chen, developmental psychologist associate professor Hong Kong University Science Technology, focuses research children’s cognitive development respect social groups. “We give credit children,” said, “that covered hours every day isn’t going make less able recognize social expressions.” Voices, gestures overall body language important children, said. children typically pay attention people’s mouths talking, “it’s far cue children communicate learn,” said, referenced 2012 study showing children able read facial emotions well mask added.

Here’s study cite:[Shades emotion: addition sunglasses masks faces reveals development facial expression Yup, states - countries too. Look Sweden. course, Spain pretty outbreak start looks like they're getting hit hard now. Luisiana got hit twice, different counties first time second time. interesting parse data, seem first spike big enough eliminate virus, bring things reasonable level seem blowing again.

NYC exactly right response, already rapidly rising cases. Lockdown helped reduce case counts manageable Francisco second-most densely populated city country. tinderbox. restrictions helped lot.

Agreed. restrictions help. That's I'm saying all. I'm saying lockdown restrictive necessary, goal cases low keep society open possible without inducing spike.

My point huge difference lockdown restrictions. clear that. think people hear say, ""lockdown"" think restrictions. No. WFH, crowds, mass testing, universal masks, closing bars/clubs/conventions, limiting travel, etc... incredibly important. Often restrictions enough (as majority country right now, people compliant anyway). Lockdown *is* harmful, get away restrictions, that's done. always knew lockdowns sustainable, approach really lockdowns used reduce case counts they've grown beyond control. Otherwise response tailored something sustain 12-18 months. both? 10, Variation Nasal Gene Expression Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 Bunyavanich, MD, MPH, MPhil1; Chantal Grant, MD2; Alfin Vicencio, Published online September 10, 2020. limitations study include **its modest cohort size, constraint 1 metropolitan region, participant age range 4 60 years**. Although study suggests one factor may partially contribute COVID-19 risk among New York–area Black individuals, many additional factors likely, especially gene expression race/ethnicity reflect multiple social, environmental, geographic factors. doubt wear masks home unless someone home infected. mean last line though? parents held accountable happens? (I guess includes grandparents/great grandparents case, apparently agreed best thing...) Lol know people France Germany literally going every weekend. German friend travelling Netherlands instance. Goalpost constantly move I'll favor assuming live rock.

.... means intentionally dense point.

Best luck that. conversations I've recently, like forget conversation sentence pick word recent one pivot of.

This problem lot people have, actually. encounter *constantly* Reddit, almost even matter topic. People know think critically conversations.  sure downvoted either. Math checks out. R0 still guess point &amp; also currently heavily influenced social distancing measures. uncertainty duration efficacy immunity conferred prior infection. \*If\* prior infection confer immunity, would pull number needed achieve herd immunity, long way go. That's low risk?! hell. Guess there's medium risk, next level would info plus full name. point identity literally naked available anyone wants borrow it. Yes, worry ""masks baby vaccines"" idea though. idea lower viral inoculum lead less severe disease, really evidence that. pretty poor article states surge death United States summer clearly was. reach April levels, increased significantly. Usually I’d agree, cases New York haven’t spiked. FaceTiming friend lives Brooklyn day people about. Everyone wearing masks sidewalks parks crowded. Subway stations looked pretty normal. Maybe virus gone part New York? use for? Germany 2 month lockdown. Neither Denmark, Belgium, Norway, Netherlands, Finland, Poland, Austria, Schweiz, Czechia 2 month lockdown. fantasising about?!
All restrictions amount people meet, lockdown. even general mask policy. UK, France, Italy Spain sort lockdown, half ""Western Europe"" comment said. actually area strictest parts quarantine.

Your logic absurd justify addressed. already know anti-inflammatory drugs key stopping body killing itself. question whether one better others. 2020.

That whole per capita deaths infection thing. That’s said most. would expect close time hasn’t major crisis many thought would point It’s sad much sub completely one-sided. either agree article says get downvoted. California has, uh... problems moment. FWIW - mugshot breathing bad, 

Try inhaling longer. Stop worshipping science like religion. see seasonal pattern action looking graphs various countries.

then problem finding evidence it.

and worship science like religion. published microbiologist understands evidence.

Influenza seasonality, would able find source influenza like one found.

Initially people thought coronavirus might well, proven true.

anyway, see response. waste much time people spreading misinformation.  Agreed. [This second Europe looks like.

It's 

We made mistake H1N1. really understand. literally exact thing people America saying earlier June order refrigerated trucks Arizona, Florida, Texas July. thought people would able look us horror repeat country. Instead seem repeated exactly here, anti-masker protests. dispiriting. downer, realistic look what's happened places look expect. History shows significant lag surge cases young population, spread vulnerable population, increase death. reach levels spring, increase. prepare that. Please put context proportion total population didnt ask flattened curve. incorrectly stated cases increasing.

and looking whole country one region faulty many parts flattened curve, many decreasing, others peaking. agree still gotta wack ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) No, lockdown, mitigate. Kids must get educated, economy must preserved - intermediate steps short everyone hide int basement. 

And record, no, nuke china. Masks, distancing etc tools work best used together. Americans overall posted quite early lol Alternatively orange jumpsuits let someone else profit labor. way American Way certified. death rate matter here. principle someone passes disease guilty attempted murder. Even mild illness young people deadly elderly vulnerable. might flu asymptomatic and, case, definitely virus/bacterial infection life passed someone died line.  results Scripps Research Institute US. Welcome China, show everything made points matter. And, worth, masks needed least enough population vaccinated actually protect others, fortunate enough early phase vaccination. seems like ccp mods job lately blame democracy. Germany, NZ, etc, pretty well. 

Also China good job containing COVID dictatorship. well leadership respect Science, infrastrucure competent enough carry large-scale lockdowns. No. took 14 years get pack cigarettes? ....and unveil evidence day now..

Weird story getting credible traction evidence always horizon. Everybody doubting  Can't people read decide themselves... quick, mods! Neither slavery involuntary servitude, *except punishment crime whereof party shall duly convicted*, shall exist within United States, place subject jurisdiction. AKA 13th amendment US Constitution.

It's part law that's allowed people make slaves prisoners decades. fun done people actually agree though it? agree.

I like guy, too, thought video focused much ""age-adjustment"" aspect progression deaths (unambiguously *bad* news necessarily significant given clear indication ratio CFR:IFR time).

If age-adjusted IFR — know much, much harder calculate — that'd far compelling. CFR depends much we're testing. doubts, reached primary outcome efficacy safety. according listed 

see example point 3 4 outcome measures. need 6 months second participants Phase 1 reporting serious adverse events \[ Time Frame: From dose 1 6 months last dose \] 
As elicited investigational site staff

So best insights vaccines efficacy outcome, full safety report mid-October. (the FDC gonna hold advisary meeting 22th). 

But bet political appointees hear report good news parts, regards outcome. give big change president try turn something alike Victory Covid announcement. Hold up..is true? trash doesn’t belong Yes would I've seen plenty teenagers even 18 take virus seriously called ""mature"" adults. Let's honest, they're selfish teenagers they'll likely selfish adult.

That's US many cases, lots adults 24 (25 brain fully developed) still making selfish reckless decisions like still teens reality selfish people nothing thier age. 

It's teens held accountable thier actions growing (because people make excuses like this) learn stuff adult world. People go ""oh well they're young they'll grow one day"" ""oh well adult know better"". know better never really held accountable thier mistakes now? Singapore’s sort lucky small. Easier implement policy. another year

As would enough. Would probably need 2-3 years, point special effects look dated. really true, democracy still best form, function correctly. Unfortunately many don't. exact hotel woman employed in. even opinion piece. letter editor local nutter.

If violate sub's rule low quality content, I'm going start posting pictures turds part self-proclaimed study ""optical evidence fecal transmission Covid-19 population 1 uncertain infection exposure."" lmao Somebody get Trump. I’ll even stay one hotels to...for sake economy course. Singapore basically thing even aggressive tracking. close visits nursing homes family members. spread nursing home employees. UV filters? seen used? cases worth doing, cases would consenting human trails. cases would mean increased lab grown tissue testing. solutions varied, I'm far expert. alternatives (not necessarily better EVERY way though, certainly less cruel) played world over, free enjoy themselves, Thanks China  Numbers rise since two three last weeks. Deaths per day even half peak months ago. trust numbers, July 30k excess deaths reported less 6k Covid-deaths. rushed phase I/II started phase III(?). rush expense safety? able use fans help right? Potentially pointing one inward one outward? Someone design - system fans placed around room windows effective create enough air exchange. bunch side-effects

You can't say justification, say safe.

They getting ahead themselves, saying likely \[a\] ""bunch side-effects"" irresponsible saying safe. think balance risk favour mass vaccinations without meaningful trial - problem lack evidence, likelihood actively dangerous. I'm actually suggesting there's overlap. great. 

If liked Nolan's previous work, different. 

I personally can't wait see times. Score amazing, fantastic set pieces. go again. Numbers starting improve; people became less vigilant, school starting again, doubt numbers spike ""I love sucking business leaders' dick!"" definitely option. least classroom 1 (or more) air filters. Ideally UV filters. keep windows open much possible fans windows. long could discuss chat. Well....Spain politicians interested money... deal! Spain money comes tourism wathever avoid losing money power. countries similar ways. USA elected president trying speed vaccine worries risk, China, Russia lying data, politicians Bolsonaro lying country, Europe similiar situation, etc... politicians suck big percentage human bad people too, matter came from, race, gender... Homo homini lupus. ""Youre calling stupid never learned 3rd grade something called ""Hyperbole"".""

I think meant say this: ""My statement meant hyperbole meant taken literally."" Essentially, needed /s end commentary.

Also:

\*you're 
\*sweetie

I mean, we're picky (and tbh kind gross) here, might well even playing field. know English second language primary, honestly matter...you really know better.

Additionally, wrong. Spanish flu bubonic plague examples illnesses still exist today, smaller pockets handfuls victims. ""hyperbole"" kind falls flat, even going try use statement defend yourself.  People argue defunding seem frequently assume defund abolish mean thing, too. Maybe rehab clinic instead personnel carrier  Uh, fuck? don't. Yes, people brain know that. social media well damage made intelligence big chunk population massive well, lot people think/say virus mutated covid-light lower deaths (or various variants ‘deaths overestimated, deaths w/ covid covid etc etc etc)

Government scientific advisors kind shitting themselves, PM handlers mainly focused economy re-opening much massive self-inflicted economy-destroying double whammy coming January  think updating ventilation priority future. Maybe old school buildings definitely new buildings. isn’t going away easily may us (hopefully less lethal form) while. kind shit America needs. Seriously. I’m sorry it’s fucking true, dude. People absolutely awful. Refuses when? one seems able tell masks stop working. ok take off? Never? Ok, we're guilty wearing mask then. Moving on.... know one would work best without massive test like, idk, clinical trials? Society willing conversation lives vs rights. conversations can't solved absolute answer fits soundbyte turn name-calling. 

I agree though, 200,000 dead people unalienable rights life, liberty, pursuit happiness. fact gets ignored results complicated quesitons. We've got lot growing do. client moving stuff facilities added 30% employees most.likely.

 running 30/7 lieu 24/7. yeah i'm god damn sick hearing feels like nagged.

i never want hear phrase ""social distancing"" again. like get it, let's smart thing let's talk ANYTHING ELSE. right punishment. would good add taking corpses outside houses, like times Bubonic plaque. 

If scared, great job. 800 people hospitalized virus countywide, 35% ICU, marking significant decline weeks earlier. new numbers similar April, summer surge. Hospitalization important metric charting course pandemic, captures many people seriously ill virus, health officials wrote statement. 

I'm glad included this. Case testing numbers off, since L.A. barely testing June fully free, widespread testing July. Deaths lasting side effects COVID matter, detection treatment improving hopefully numbers keep going down. province refusing switch quarantined children online option go online begin.with. trying prevent people going hospital life threatening illness. Thank coming TED talk. Desperately wanting believe something stupid is, fact, stupid. It’s worse manage get intelligent, you’ve let fear overpower intelligence badly you’re coward well stupid. Norway well. Finland stands -4% (from memory, check). Why? deny it? Lol difficult FDA-approved KN95s available sale online. bought 20 high-risk scenarios wildfires live. Keep mind pricey (~$1.70 per mask) I’m sure protocol safely reusing them. That’s probably best bet one else take precautions. person looking things complain about...  Spain size American rural area.

This counter fact Spain areas low density, vastness USA think appreciate. also think fully appropriate hand wave risk away this, though. non-zero risk something missed shorter duration, year would preferable. However, things like mitigated vaccinating healthy individuals first.

The piece is, tough educate masses clinical trial design... even tougher guys like Fauci muzzled. we're used manipulated hating fellow common man benefit people power enforce hatred opportunity benefit it. Everybody getting Covid now! shitpost? thing happening Arizona. Plus schools open, closed May. Gov says 2 ppl died terrorism. 

$2T debt later, 5 unrelated countries subdued. 

Gov’s evilness incompetence causes 200k+ deaths

We tried bro Omg, man, believe now. managed take 50k? net salary? maybe different calculations.

However, seeing recent videos shift weird positivity optimism, mentioning studies published bad news, stopped galking reinfections long term effects. came guest DW CNBC several times. 

I still believe even though person never meet can't know sure, still truth everything says, molded saying good stuff require wearing masks now. wore masks socially distanced harsh punishment. screwed things Montreal too. jewish want nothing crazies. Well, look excess deaths less ordinary, yeah they're high. Stockholm hit really bad early on. losers still blame Trump. want point out, article pic inline. pic photo east Jakarta cemetery, article took place East Java.

Ffs Take look history humanity comes that. Also
It certainly mention anybody vote, mentally impaired? make logic you? Typical socialist suppose work ways?

Nope.

If literally gym I'm wearing mask, think alright? simple answer higher risk populations taking (and benefiting from) measures keep safe. say elderly vulnerable would huge understatement. aged 70 hundreds *thousands* times likely suffer fatal outcome Covid-19 age group. initial virus ran unchecked assisted living facilities, nursing homes, older congregate populations.

Better understanding virus transmission improved ability prevent contain outbreaks elderly population. So, life, never heard single criminal sentenced community service... ever?  so, one successful hermits I've ever come across, who's also somehow internet? Yeah, call bullshit ya. 


Community service acceptable widely recognized sentence decades (if longer) around world. Stop trying purposefully misconstrue what's going on; fool one end looking like complete fucking moron. talking about? live America know already hand physical labor punishment time. people pick trash side highway community service example. Hell, entire prison system makes corporations billions dollars year forced labor. 

It bloodlust hope people endangering society punished. wish could anti-maskers dig graves average Americanican far obese dig six feet unless digging done metaphorical cheeseburger. trying slow spread hospitals overwhelmed, reopening makes sense. 

If trying prevent infections entirely, reopening makes sense.

Which one again? happens every country every day. think freeways got clean? America send prison labor break union activities cross picket lines. much bigger issues inventive community service Every state America locked time too, exceptions (Iowa, Nebraska, Arkansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming). states (including Florida) locked entire month April. locked several weeks March May too. want people sick flu cold put work. selfish make dig graves thousands die year flu. 

What’s taking seriously? Shutting economy losing thousands businesses jobs. Rising rates depression suicides?  People die everyday let know you’re holding vigils everyone cancer died today hunger medical malpractice make separate, new fly list? I'd hate 5 year old Jimmy ate poptart shape gun fly list plague rats. point prone ventilation fluid collect front lungs less likely block airways increases o2 absorption   Looks like case numbers continue tick downwards places US. states still going peaks, thankfully largest areas seem downward side curve. Good vaccine news also horizon, Pfizer affirming report data next month, Oxford trial resuming. 

I hope optimism time past 6 months. really seems like end near virus, 2021 back ""normal"". exclusive Indonesia. Maybe, may perform effectively colder weather. People also need realize getting sufficient Vitamin complicated. people need 2000 IU's others need 5000 even 10,000. Others really need get sun. 

And supplementing get enough, needs done often several months get levels need. 

Obviously, blood work way know this. Yup. Especially lot people get flu presumed Covid positive told quarantine. Sure, there’s test flu 100% accurate doctors likely tell people stay home sick.

I know job I’m sick I’ll stay home year, that’s factor well usually many flu try keep working (and employer often let’s them). also get flu covid time, can't help chances. documented cases this.

Trying figure patient flu covid delay treatment, endangering patient.

The flu leave patient vulnerable covid vice versa previous infection weaken patient get infected shortly after.

Misdiagnosis caused act quickly treat patient could expose patients either disease.

There evidence vaccinations may stimulate immune system bit, making bit ready fight diseases. stop getting covid, course, can't hurt chances fighting it.

There's honestly lot reasons vaccinate, especially similar 2 diseases look Two decades flatten curve!!!! Since IFR varies much age, quoting single number, like .7%, totally invalid.  IFR 30 close zero.  IFR 80 like 10%. don’t need entire world’s population vaccinated right away get control. need global distribution. It’s also important point likely end several rounds vaccines first ones won’t effective. Science get better, COVID vaccines get cheaper, easier manufacture/ distribute, effective. wave end dies entirely. Otherwise there'd ever 1 wave Governments already pre-guaranteeing purchase potential vaccines full production start prior final trials. fails trails worthless, still paid governments. That's cut weeks time finishing trials full production. Russia built dozens factories east Moscow start WW-2. China built &amp; staffed huge hospital outside Wuhan months ago. sure many oil/gas rigs UK built north sea 30 years ago.  premature without appropriate guidelines place enforcement measures. Even places strict guidelines 40% businesses actually follow / enforce them. people become responsible adults premature. community service digging graves need dug. needed failure take covid seriously. 

Anti maskers shamed society. thought extremists low iq much much lower chance higher education employment control groups. Social consequence thing-if cheat lie steal people assume again. put good time ahead health others probably again-that isn’t someone want community. Take anti-vax ideas job interview. 

Camps no. Pretty simple line sand. Community service regulations-Max hours all. go home after. 

We every civilized country every day. forced labor? Yeah that’s great method always successful history huh. Curious substitute teacher pay area. Around here, 2-year degree sub makes minimum wage day-by-day assignments. can't get salaried teacher there, sub pay enough convince someone instead? lockdown either '57 '09 Irish tourists absolute best, though. Kind, fun, thoughtful, never loud! Excellent article Anti-vaxxers unfortunately thing long idiot president came scene, always would’ve level resistance jackasses it. anti-mask movement personally irritates more, agree dear leader huge problem front Article 5 Nuremberg laws 

Any person violates prohibition Article 1 punished prison hard labour [Zuchthaus].
A male violates prohibition Article 2 punished prison [Gefängnis] prison hard labour.
Any person violating provisions Articles 3 4 punished prison hard labour one year fine, one penalties.

Seems rather familiar doesn’t it? I’m sure Germans thought Jews deserve it, reap sown. laws mandated 

Oh it’s okay it’s anti mask. It’s slippery slope here. drove teen school last week happy see every student walking student parking lot car line wearing mask, wearing properly. chin/neck warmers bunch. live south, last week temps 8am lower 80s humidity same. 

The weekly phone blast principal still goes dress code hasn’t remind anyone masks. “we don’t want see anyone’s bellies underwear” line uses finally cools sometime Halloween. I've got multiple employees decade, mind, there's really choice. older, health issues, *I* want stand bar table random person face day, can't expect it. Wir heizen nicht für die Luftwaffe! Possible. Also possible initial spread hit vulnerable hard really knew happening handle it, restrictions masking people getting much smaller doses virus fighting better. 

We used really pay attention older people serious cases lot initial asymptomatic spread went unnoticed. Hard say many people really spring. Yea, pretty hard find new, available -80 storage space. stop production medicine sure space, need produce everything enough new vaccines entire world. easy Unless turns loud shouting subway (or Americans call conversational volume). Actually, mainly conservative Republican push reopen economy blatant disregard scientific facts effects *actually* *literally* killing people. 

If drive drunk someone gets killed reckless actions, I'm still murderer, intent not. actively engaged activities could potentially lead death, murderer. So, net vaccine might work great, might work fairly well, might work somewhat, might work all.  different results pandemic. 

It took three scientists write op ed?   Paging captain obvious. site tracking shitty companies covid? company remote months forcing everyone back office full time regard safety. staggered alternating schedules, even want require masks employees complained. I've told every single department head/VP it, many departments totally fine fully remote including parent company's word final. People feel safe Radiolab one also good. think author take consideration differences development Covid-19 vaccine going. likely multiple effective vaccines Covid-19. 

I think given many successful mean genetically predisposed one vaccine effective you, get another one.

For me, see taking couple make sure. long safe that. hell community service COMMITTING CRIME 'forced labour'? see lot idiots purposefully misunderstanding shit disturbers.  


I'd wager anyone thinks unacceptable punishment specific crime (endangering lives wearing mask) likely anti-masker. ....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

NO take vaccine, also stop wearing mask unless it’s mandated stop giving level fuck vaccine. Anyone assuming understand rates numbers might merely giving stranger benefit doubt; 

Giving benefit doubt necessarily arguing bad faith, 


 review comment history. Honestly, think mask wearing peak cold/flu seasons always thing. imagine amount people gotten severely ill died random person cold mild flu run errand spread someone immune system.  


I would hope pandemic shows people effective mask wearing adopt regular part routines, hear many people bitching ""freedom"", doubt happen, even means saving lives. Exactly. Germans super friendly helpful. It’s attitude. New Mexico, live, Colorado, transport bulk milk tankers compliant part masks. spots less become acceptable thing day. places see shunned businesses like gun shop motorcycle shop. Two places going quite frequently, rarely amount ""hoaxers"" frequent premises. much like shoot ride, less activities lonesome. replied someone saying masks inhibit breathing, saying actually struggle breathe (this implies mask issue, given comment chain replied to). say struggle breathe without mask someone asks you.

So intended show struggled breathe mask (""I'm tired argument""), fully knowing mask plays part. mad think pretending doctor, instead someone reading writing. makes extra special whole fuckin west coast fire can't open goddamn window like either cause infected person recover prevent passing someone else

If infected person hospital, securely away general public, way virus pass public via staff. That's happened first wave, happening second virus trying jump people antibodies. Fortunately I’m US. Yeah it’s nothing short tragedy, Fauci fact answer this, contrary previous comment. Sorry don’t want microchip bill Probably watched lot *Baywatch* 😂   arguement people accuse Trump lying It’s quite frankly hilarious. vaccine comes it’s even half way effective people going stop level giving fuck. Sports fans, bars, restaurants packed, concerts, etc start happening immediately.

I’m really sure people keep trying push “new normal” thing. People (and should) adhere guidelines time get vaccine, assuming timeline less year ideally two most. that, one likes social distancing, one likes wearing mask, it’s gonna happen. keep seeing people saying masks stay even vaccine that’s laughable. Maybe people adopt wearing one showing symptoms illness (which would good thing IMO), percentage people without symptoms wearing mask US year two low single digits best, likely less 1%. Let fix title lil bit:

""Scientists outraged White House &lt;you put anything they've done still  faith widely available vaccine mid 2022 later. supply chains set deal many new vaccines. I've waiting morbidity data start creeping there's much. I'm guessing CDC collecting reporting years. Best far report small survey showing 2x many flu symptoms persisting 2 weeks post recovery. giving people right survive political you? think would particularly productive objective. literally reason expect 20% infected people debilitating lifelong symptoms support eating drinking inside novel virus epidemic known vaccine definition antimask...or brain developed point recognize cannot eat drink mask properly worn. young remember 2009? hear you, van cost? see lot people losing asses vehicles, insurance vehicle maintenance, rent.  vehicle $500 48,000 miles ago. science masks pretty well established. reading? matriculate? Vaccine production needs completely different machinery. cannot empty phone factory floor storage put new machinery. First, there's enough new machinery vaccine production, second, phone production machines would become dusty would need replaced afterwards.

Also, problems supply chain. Glass vial production already ramped enough vials everyone 2021. standard practice (one vaccine per person) need five billion vials, five billion needles, 5 billion plastic wraps etc. etc.

I think currently average vaccination schedule developed world \~3 vaccines every 10-20 years, less underdeveloped countries, complete additional vaccination everyone within year, need ramp production logistics maybe six- tenfold!?

That's want one vial vaccine multiple people, dose accurate single-dose vials.  Fuck what. think Texas moniker might generous. Mississippi maybe? Depends type zombies talking here. talking stumble stumble groan? strung PCP like World War Z? think eloquently explained point! acceptable risk. happened every day everybody's lives balancing risks rewards, even subconsciously Switzerland require masks lockdown experiencing second wave? Why? concerned virus, gym last place go. literally highest risk activity? Can't work ways? 

If me, I'd wait another months. Maybe got vaccine, hopefully rolling early next year. """"""""Sorry needed vote better government would give money survive.""""""""""

Thats quote....
You politicized first basicaly dismissed right work survive order save life's hell own. pity socialists here. everybody wants handouts kid  Peppridge farms remembers Rest world follow suit. pretty sure well complacent seasonal covid deaths years, longer novel, long term effects better known, death rate lower. first couple months, really good running joke. Introverts normally forced live extrovert world, career success driven golf score performance; first time, extroverts forced experience world hated.

However, point, want over. We're together, except anti-science/pro-diseasers. Forced labor fail society pretty standardized. think freeways cleaned themselves? trying prevent it? Seek neighbors live alone. Visit front porch. Offer cup coffee snack. instance like covid 100 years. 
 like every virus immunity population knew nothing it. still good treatment it.

Vaccines miracle cures. sort thinking get people need get sick sick. needs happen public education vaccines actually work. period social distancing need followed vaccination body builds immunity. people build immunity. large events come back, need certain percentage people vaccinated previously sick build immunity medically unable get vaccinated, groups people likely also vulnerable severe covid.

As get vaccinated, however, taking steps towards getting back normal. nothing. case numbers go down, states open people start feel comfortable more. Jesus...  fully agree, that's immediately followed calculation disclaimer using hard available data whereas studies indicate significant number infections went undiagnosed. Yes, ""death rate"" would dropped ratio, already accounted description followed adjusting projected death total downward 80% due assumption 4/5 cases undiagnosed. affect adjusted projection already baked in, edited post clarify case anyone trying compare directly published IFR figures.

I purposefully use CFR IFR people understand mean, tendency days (for good reason, unfortunately) dismiss anything one understand statistics political manipulation, trying use plain English... although say figure ""fatality per case rate.""

I agree, though, transparency accuracy key, math used:

Population = 625M

Confirmed cases = 6,45,000

Confirmed deaths = 194,000

Herd immunity = 2/3 population (figure I've heard often prior years, though current trend seems making whatever number want bolster political objectives)

Since projected deaths reach ""herd immunity"" means death rate x percentage population reach threshold, leaves calculation of:

(Deaths / cases) \* (population \* 2/3)

Using available hard data without adjustments, comes 12.5M deaths.

The problem, mentioned, word ""Confirmed."" actually need total number people infected, numbers US particular entirely dependent availability testing. Studies (and common sense) indicate quite infections undiagnosed. purely anecdotal, personally know people turned away local testing centers (some gotten 8 despite widespread fanfare open 5pm), others waited weeks results, others bother hearing issues others having. Add significant percentage false negatives tests generated, folks seek testing due asymptomatic, discrepancy becomes clear.

If studies right, 4 5 undiagnosed would mean reduction death rate 80% leads death projection 2.5M. Even use extreme outside projection CDC actual infection rate could high 10x confirmed, means BEST case scenario using numbers WHITE HOUSE 1.25M dead Americans reaching land Oz everyone suddenly stops dying gets pony.

That's still 7 figures last time counted, still mean people done dying. mean, however, there's nothing uncontainable, critical cases hit healthcare system people can't even taken next county ICU full.

Mind you, purposefully used estimates drove figure DOWN... dramatically that. also compelling evidence drives UP. Chiefly, substantial increase deaths unaccounted positive diagnoses purpose year would counted ""probable"". is, instance, deaths flu often counted... every comparison I've seen far flu vs covid death rates either significantly undercounts covid overcounts flu depending perspective... comparing probable flu numbers confirmed covid numbers see done daily deceptive, can't help notice I've ever seen numbers skewed one direction.

The atypical death rate adjusted seasonal factors indicates actual covid death toll certainly higher, could actually much 2x reported. chose completely ignore this, however, simple reason trying avoid estimation wherever possible, using White House's numbers driven worst predictions, driven nothing including common sense gives conservative figure. point being... even using conservative figures, outcome ""plan"" entirely unacceptable.

Obviously, number reasons, things could much worse flu season kicks in... case 1918.

All which, though, misses larger point ""herd immunity"" nothing buzz word describes meta-phenomenon. plan. even little bit. Saying plan covid ""herd immunity"" every bit inane going Shark Tank saying business plan ""synergy."" locked those. Oh assure you, children rely bit. Typical child super hearing hear moment say something want hear. rich, rest you...2024. right! Thank goodness Newsom putting needs aside greater good

/s It’s every shift. could happen shift, ten times, week.  Absolutely. understand people think walk retail / service / hospitality employees. mean respect fellow person. ? seen Fauci said today? DOOMED. needs shutdown everything like yesterday one EVER dies anything ever again. People assume propaganda come government helps FOX pull wool eyes. Yeah dude went window awhile ago.  know five year old opting wear mask school even though doesn’t to. I’ve seen beg mom let wear mask it’s completely unnecessary (ex, car driving somewhere.) issue wearing one day long.

As far she’s concerned wearing mask everyday different wearing underwear everyday except gets show people cool mask fabrics. Man, mean easy breezy person...but based description sounds like zero indoor interaction anyone (apart essential trips store), contact others outdoors, relatively brief, wearing mask.

I think likelihood exposed first place especially low description accurate/complete. much heartache inviting place. especially worried, ask wear mask apartment. Even Dr. Fauci cleaner come house wear mask- anything incredibly wall here. mental health population primary concern physical health population risk.

Again, risk physical health *immeasurably* minuscule compared mental health risks. respect, think attention pivot damage lockdowns caused? opinion way, based *statistically* survivable virus is. can't figure life me, statement like becomes absolute dead-end people. allowed talk survival rate? discuss fact measures significantly damaging virus? happened us? deemed reaction due vaccine per se 

Source? said trial would proceed, that. I'm also biased toward common sense. Since toddlers we've told cover mouths cough -- absolutely makes sense. Anti maskers lazy assholes honestly. really though. means we’d get maskless people getting cases masked people getting lesser cases general right? context otherwise perfectly healthy young people massive heart attacks weeks infection? searched ds9 like experimental drug never heard like idiot. Well, thing keeps saying ""fuck it"" really want get this, myself. already know one person still recovered five months. took vacation Mexico caught it, I'd feel even miserable knowing could avoided stupid. Fining going save lives.

Working investment structure help dramatically improve ventilation probably would.

Let's effective without morally righteous.  Also, firing multiple Inspectors General, get rid oversight.  think mass injection unskilled labor help way quickly produce safe, effective vaccine doses?

People need jobs country. hire people en masse cure cancer! Hire people en masse build hypersonic glide vehicles! Hire people en masse get nuclear fusion commercially viable!  Yeah. Plenty people don’t know scientific theory different colloquial term. 

It’s something taught more. It’s simple thing teach would prevent lot misunderstanding. 450 l aquarium

Not all, ""America good, Europe bad"" comment today see desperate right I'll let final comment. North East: Sunderland Newcastle put local lock down; Hartlepool South Tyneside also government's watch list. space week known infections trebled. Hospitalisations starting creep too. time last week seeing parts country struggling thinking we're bad all. shows quickly turn around, although suspect bubbling surface less soon re-opened back July.

If schools closing Covid high rate would’ve heard Yeah, insane bullshit happy talk trolls dealt June moved new target. disingenuous. They'll move ""Sure, hospitalizations up, deaths still down,"" inevitable, ""Sure, deaths up, cases down!"" start cycle again. We've seen corporations pay 3k employee killed. view cheaper allow employees murdered. anticipate 'over'?

For personally, vaccine, start live normally (by definition) again. think going take time feel comfortable going crowded events again, definitely plan stuff like going eat, traveling see family, etc. really weird job.

Well, least masks squashing whatever promised ill-considered investment. think thats simply far worse reporting probably much less testing covid too. plenty science based sources pointing flaws tests

I'm literally asking share one Fever, cough (and cough persists day), fatigue, headache. Wife lost sense taste.

Never said something else. given precautions we've taking, otherwise limited exposure literally anyone outside workplace, would surprise me.  one biggest tit? It’s easy say Kissy face guy, cliche drunk heels blonde invisible trombone guy Oe even skinny ginger office guy hulking out... nope it’s mask guy ain’t pulling anyone...as sensible is. Sadly that's waaaay reasonable large chunk US.  hate politics want, science science. Yes, politics slow many places, scientists dedicating whole lives bettering humanity. generalizing whole nation ffs. Yes asymptomatic people desperately need tested.

Have yet learned asymptomatic people spread virus? Try keep up. Data yet says article, jump conclusions yet. exactly? Two really good friends Canadians, noticeable accent all. met would assume they're Americans. lot people get tested routinely due work, visiting hospital something unrelated, traveling. example got tested today taking kid see grandparents soon. I’ll pretty surprised comes back positive, would hate go visit introduce virus circle. mom says live basement free get job pandemic long keep clean here. ruin people. have. especially driver happens black  agree funerals provided people wear masks weddings allowed IMO. extreme end...why things ever open flu season?

This question lot people sub asking themselves. seen people *literally* claim murder manslaughter wear mask. hold true flu season? cut lethality determine committing murder viral outbreak? lot people unfortunately lost touch reality. else go? Nobody wants Americans. terrible reputation around world think?! I'm lucky enough dual citizenship Taiwan, top pick. worry China eventually I'm going Taiwan, means I'll need prepare military service unless decide flee. Infection eyes among rare methods transmission. long it’s crowded relatively safe.  facetime, google meet, instagram, whatsapp, facebook, slack though. Zoom. virus knows video chat platform use attack Zoom.  Like already said... that's ALREADY baked numbers shared. MAJORITY positive test cases quoted elderly. Deaths divided total positive tests population 

Cases /=/ deaths. Here's charts better help understand CFR age group.

As see, ages 0-49, odds dying COVID 0.4%. 

From ages 50-59, odds lower 1.3%. 

It start count 60 (in layman terms, elderly), CFR skyrockets. I’ve favor eliminating tipping culture long. pandemic results that, there’s least silver lining. telling people willing listen take advice person decades experience one cited doctors world? That's shocking. I'll take opinion anyday. Pull ASAP. dedication craft

Is physicians' ""dedication craft"" made AMA spearhead public relations campaigns *against* single-payer healthcare years?

This image selfless benevolent doctor people try paint always cracks force-fit onto US healthcare system. course minority US doctors qualities; obviously exception rule, however. It’s life, selfish. many dead people find acceptable? $$$

Yep, vaccines big growth sector No. BioNTech 2003. Two Weeks here’s thing: you’re picking choosing type social gatherings acceptable not. makes hypocrite listened to. Fuck, people morons. Thx! family since 1942. grandparents built then, parents bought 1985 born inherited father passed unexpectedly January. I'm pretty sure use products tested monkeys daily life. Consider maybe elevated level exposure international travel starts again. school we’re propping doors open better ventilation keeping locked shut lockdown emergency 🙄 want elaborate. look cases ethics compromised sake science (Jiankui China example) go well. rarely ever goes well. Scientists aware would think.  COVID thing way hand now. government should’ve closed everything month people should’ve stayed home keeping essential workers opened pay everyone wages try stop spreading. sad people died didn’t too. Thank good don’t live U.S.A Correlation causation. What's alternative? whole point lockdown stop healthcare services overwhelmed, one chance zero covid lots countries missed Unfortunately we’re corner downtown don’t “parking lot” per se. read legislation, think fixed penalty notice. either pay full, go court. plead guilty court fine assessed, imagine much much lower £10k little income. I'm going assume there's still fucking pandemic going on. Glad got fined.

The fuck talking future wives for, what??
There's reason lockdown mass gatherings. There's important things worrying trying rekindle past societal activities. instance, *a virus propells even futher fruition when, said societal activities take place* would better solution? Fine little bit party, covid deaths arise fine heavier amount? drop heavier fine set example, parties happen first place? know... enforce regulations order prevent spikes deaths? Gee whizz, dunno, seems working countries, maybe could work UK. 

Leave fantasies behind mate, cringe fuck. trying throw party mass pandemic. What’s point wearing gloves?  100K overkill. 400 *way* enough long sampling scheme okay. You’re right. I’m social distancing masks time.. things can’t wait. Tenet pretty good. agree, going long slow recovery towards anything close movie numbers pre-covid it’s actually genetics fine. Otherwise, splitting racial groups divides people. also worry bigger things. mind capable holding many different lines information, choose one.

Also, sweetie, I'm perfectly content sensible deadly virus. I'll let know ever suffer sort traumatic brain injury would require put stock opinion though, okay? ;) good one. new case count lower it’s been. Somethings going test numbers. They’re place day day. don’t think u realize bad it’s going get Gotta love New York Times 🙄  Trying diversify location sampling from. Since we’re talking restaurants, different genres restaurants would also useful. Basically, dont want favor one location others (such looking nearest restaurants) leads inaccurate samples.  lot people think corona vaccines cause spine inflammation.

And thank media taking routine press release intentionally dramatising without context sake clicks.

I found ONE media outlet actually interviewed expert said stoppages nothing ordinary there's even 50/50 chance person received placebo.

Needless say, decision continue testing got buried sidebar covered all. _reason_ decision continue testing mentioned ANYWHERE media. guy get placebo? illness unrelated? knows.

Trump hates media left wing, valid reasons hate media well. People forget politicians thrive uncertainty chaos; media well. fearful people consume news like comfort food give ad impressions... Someone trying COVERUP coronavirus. one I'm confused. 

First all, linked article say 1840? headline see click reports 1,840 new COVID-19 cases, 47 deaths

Where's 3905/146 coming from...?

Secondly, 3905 cases 146 deaths, that... surprising Texas? 7 day average daily cases hanging around 3-4 thousand throughout September far, deaths low-mid 100s. 3900 cases 150 deaths sounds like pretty standard day them, comments make sound like they're getting surge something. Edit: isn’t sarcastic comment, perceived comments. 

Or go Sweden route forget it. Actually little profit vaccines historically. shareholders well good news, Pharma's small profit margin production distribution vaccines.... takes beat sacrificing 300,000-400,000 americans. small price pay able eat applebees without mask. wont people acting especially dumb front deadly unknown virus X. time on, Federal Government keep millions spare monkeys ready emergencies secret underground facility desert Nevada.

They already were, monkeys escaped took White House. cough worried times 100% productive. part year suffer little. Well I'm 20s underlying health issues, statstics say won't. 

Also, pretty sure already end hospital. lockdown months killing people headache, nasal issues sore throat anytime last week? so, must isolate.

The entire west coast US chocking smoke: uhhhh.... no, me. Yep. also linked information sense self. Thus challenging it, challenging them, defend it.

And that's true lots people, theorists. ""Older person who's set ways"" good example. realize true, look closely, actively seperate knowledge are, take opposing viewpoints comparison own, hostile sense, true comparison. Lol mp sub say headache? I'd rather break rules good (lie get test) bad(break quarantine)?

Wikipedia:


During coronavirus pandemic 2020, Fosun Pharmaceuticals partnered German biotech firm Biopharmaceutical New Technologies, (BioNTech)[38] work distribute experimental coronavirus vaccine. approved, Fosun market vaccine China, BioNTech retain rights sell internationally. PM known winging everything does, fine shitty columnist, less fine he's charge entire country. Testing get scaled up, plan pathetic attempt divert attention incompetence. Well guess what? They're open now.  doesn’t happen coronavirus.

Do coronaviruses bind ACE2? What's joke? Ya you’re wrong all. say There’s much without competent centralized leadership control message Dude, keep it. keep too. I’m healthcare I’m intimately familiar virus. vaccines rushed market quickly. realize they’re rushed badly needed, also know financial reward first available vaccine great enough blur industry’s already blurry concept ethics standards. Like everyone else, desperately want life back. get need vaccine. also remember thalidomide babies 60’s England. don’t trust single member administration take care necessary keep population safe. healthcare worker, dont want first. Pretty good ask me, schools back still waiting numbers skyrocket say mortgage.  foreclosure sold recently $10,000.  need work, whoever bought make money.  got tore foreclosure really helped us financially. Almost every place I've ever worked gone. try limit fixed bills. thousands thousands negative cases counted like last time percentage seemed really high? Good luck, hope get well soon, sure update us! 2003 SARS. didn’t get developed simply bc virus kind went away own. 

Fucking idiots. even best times.

If take arrow knee archery range, can't hold IOC liable it. Ditto taking coronavirus immune system. fucking shit! many bodies need counts piling up? China considered East asia, southeast asia. White people going without care world world around goes shit, tradition. Bought time what? 200 deaths country almost 200k deaths sounds like meat packing might one safer occupations right now. know

You know nothing, ~~John Snow~~ dumbass. covid numbers coming China line rest Asian numbers. Replace “new” second. pull trigger, definitely first country second national lockdown.  tldr get chance Explain actively comparing COVID-19 common flu, saying masks joke, etc competent. Israeli people give two fucks lock down. demonstrations protests Netanyahu, SATURDAY, past 15 weeks so. 10 thousand people, marching Jerusalem. need heard. That's give old school prison hose afterward. Portland even people worried virus automatically wear mask. Ok asshole even read article posting it? headline clearly said Texas 1,840 cases 47 deaths. fuck guy get number from? mean, Israel also western democracy, presuming exclude occupied Palestine.

Polling showing anti-lockdown / anti-mask types noisy minority. think came it, health system truly get point strained enough reducing hospitalizations necessary keep stuff getting overwhelmed, get compliance lockdown. US sort shown people self-correct bit (eventually), targeted closures sometimes enough least keep another New York happening.

The primary goal keep cases overwhelming health system. Truly minimizing cases secondary. Unfortunately society quite level discipline. Outside Asia anyways... Damn. Holy shit. That's amazing. Really fucking send point home. Sadly change people's minds stupid. also almost every state country zero evidence community transmission. Protesting Melbourne fucked equivalent protesting there’s known local cases. great idea. Dig bury covid dead. tried? No. There’s problem.  Heh. made clean hospital without facemask. Nah I'll keep wearing mask real vaccine released. I’m antiVax this.   understand China able achieve this, good take look find outbreak.

Take Dalian, city 6 million heard States. 

* July, patient went hospital covid symptoms.
* tested confirmed positive.
* Contact tracing revealed cluster infections (12 confirmed 14 asymptomatic). 
* Close contacts put quarantine. 
* City officials announce test 6 million residents city. 
* weeks clear city goes back normal. 
 
This essentially many cases too, Beijing, Wuhan, Urumqi, probably others. That's interesting, OK kind horrifying NYC MTA employees. makes sense number high too, MTA employees living working middle worst hotspot pandemic far. Meat plants would spread whole county, including lower-risk places. Would pretty boring zombie movie 0,3% infected turn zombie. He's locking country fucking US he's whole family. guy unbelievable. pray day goes jail, even year. He's corrupt he's mind destroying economy middle class lower. Fucking rodent. deadshot, really [fumbled make deliver 10s billions doses - mask stocks run way get anywhere near completing Covid vaccinations.

And don’t even understand covids effects yet, clue vaccine efficacy - many potential complications. Goodness knows many anti-vaxxer’s normal people wait out. Funny there's always people accusing neutral positive china comments bot driven.

""Gaslight. Obstruct. PROJECT"" high amount faith trust scientists working field believe viable ""effective"" vaccine end year probably China USA. However, much faith political side give access everyone world :( think take mid-2021 majority us developed countries access. Hopefully, become virus poor countries fighting years. Hi everyone, looking either comfort atleast straight answers. mum older 60s smoking 20yrs weight anything I’ve cautious around do. siblings think I’m protective mind gets probably won’t survive. know that’s thinking positive side I’m realistic, health insurance wouldn’t say we’re low income means still worry lot. justified worrying much?? 
Thanks 🙏 
Stay safe everyone! Peak r/coronavirus: calls someone MAGA supporter wanting get vaccine. Lmao deep end. good day safe! want get vaccine lock house!  yet people still vote stupid republicans.

Despite signs place telling people so, egregious amount garbage gets dumped latrines every year. garbage removed employees forest service. truly awful job clean people. stupid go work COVID obviously gone... exactly economic stimulus social safety nets for. person worry they'll pay rent eat next meal, they're likely stay home they're sick. 

At least blame needs placed tasked keeping us safe.

Let's start making degenerates US this! Thanks; I'm going theaters GF gone drive-ins. work film business primarily curious experience also kind profits studios making now.

It's odd. know, really think over, people realize need movies less thought. coming someone whose life devoted movies. I'm German American. Never want bamboozle all.

We frequently speak German home. Particularly Grand Parents taught English first. Wonder would sound

Edit: clear I'm defending girl's actions way. Usually reputation Americans get countries reason. However immediately judging someone based solely speak rather act? make better? Bruh Kuwait full lockdown like 2 months ago think one seeking mental health  I'm immuno-suppressants, pretty much go necessary medical appointments nothing else. husband works home. one kindergartener, I'm homeschooling know different, fine.

Our 16 year old would LOVE go in-person school. wants go in-person much. also knows able handle anxiety. great mental health in-person. going far worse mental health kids know brought something home killed me. They're horrible, though many experience. I've used along Appalachian Trail - dare say - pleasant experience.

Revenge moral. make anything better. Punishment make things better, measure, talking instinct revenge-justice. Yeah sure. 

Also would call someone non-vegan drive car kill bug that? jealous. want hear story! think do. wanna see it, definitely peak times go avoid crowds. Weekday nights going pretty good serious bs. government whatever comfortable means. Everything shit. Fuck government fuck Netanyahu he's crazy ass wife. definitely referendum Hong Kong government (and extension, Beijing government). supposed everyone tested week...but extended another week due low turn rate. end, less quarter people got tested. non-American, wrong guys? lol Well, don't. anyone vouch scholarship here? Seems like little bitter something. confirmed part vaccine group. information released already. wrong country?

Contempt human suffering involves workers members ethnic underclasses. Denying government services like health care. taxing capital could easily pay health care. Attacking journalists report said suffering. What's marijuana addicted it? Brah...your gonna put pork farmers business boycott. farmers gonna sell farms to......China colleges chose act way that's going get people killed.

this 100% predictable. asymptomatic case, count infection start show symptoms. case seems though likely dead virus. tests ongoing. well blatantly stupid I'm sure everyone disagree. sure wear maga hat go get mystery substance injected. Hopefully something bleach UV light originally recommended... pay monthly fee Disney Subscription top 30 bucks watch movie IMDB rating 5,4? Wow, really got nerve Well, do.

Stay safe. went talk hospitals need patients making enough money.

Maybe he's thinking privately-run, for-profit prisons? solution everyone see time people still spinning china hides everything bogus.

have seen contact tracing, seen testing policy, seen lockdown action, eyes while. Fold piece tissue bridge nose &amp; put mask it. stops glasses fogging! obviously ridiculously rosy uninformed view world. huge part country's economy well. ENOUGH perverts there.  Horseshoe theory full effect. red hats one. lack compassion human suffering involves workers underclass based ethnicity on. systematic lies 1) people actually suffering, 2) people deserve it, 3) journalists liars. Moths nervous anymore Nope. Hate anti vaxers. They're almost stupid maga people.   places Australia completely covid free long time example. stage IV endometriosis eating holes diaphragm lungs. wear mask HIIT 3x week. annoying, suffocating me. I'd rather annoyed contract spread Covid. decided wait blu-ray release watch home Sure do. Netherlands. get test need wait 2 days travel 60+ km location. public transport!

But - goo know- location accessible bikes! trials, fails it’ll damage us since neighbors. That's one advantage place like China. take steps places aiming eradication “With new infections running high 4,000 day, Israeli ministers Sunday approved three-week nationwide lockdown upcoming Jewish holidays contain resurgent coronavirus outbreak.” prevent malicious editing

Every country competing freezers. distribution bottleneck global problem US insulated from. How's deaths hospitalizations compared though moron president would anything get ""vaccine"" ready election matter dangerous is. clearly value human life all. I'll wait one that's actually safe, thanks. Murica real question whether matters not. there's data showing infections hurting people, say, ""so - herd immunity aiming for."" understand disparity death rate age range fine. Ignoring growing number younger folks developed chronic covid related conditions president fights federal court strike protection pre existing conditions, incorrectly implying numbers shared tempered negated impact age.

They not.

I divided TOTAL positives... elderly. Locally here, we're testing kids athletes anyone else.

What us equivalent saying humans incapable giving birth... subtract women since they're ones problem.

I could similarly fool believing none society's problems exist negating affected groups.

Or could realize society people. 

Break subcategories want, add back up, White House ""plan"" still millions dead Americans...  whether decide count not. year, Zyrtec failed me. switch Allegra. eyes itch, nose itches... ugh.

Had switch Allegra, fever, coughing, headache, sore throat. talking about? Chicago covid epicenter Illinois.  read whole thing. feels like statement ""it bad, bad right?"". me, feels like sense normalization situation. accuse u anything. would probably think similarly situation well. feel try normalize deaths like remember worse wars. 

If offend u, deeply apologize. needs bloggbussa got neggflix b! mainly meant complaining conditions US whole one main point poor working conditions. multiple liberal friends claim US brink violent revolution bad life is. conservative friends think US pretty great even like jobs.

Meanwhile, travel lot spend anytime looking ancestors lived even 100 years ago see Americans pretty amazing life. COMING MOUNTAINSIDE! Poor meat plant workers left choice risk lives minimum wage, recognized even sacrifice, 20k 200 dead

Isn't every ""essential"" worker died work?

We give meat packers respect fuck guy Wendy's right?

Right... 

So headline 

""Essential workers die feed family. one seems actually care."" must named Marcel Everytime see comment like (they're exact same, matter find them), makes giggle type person. Let guess u/Westcoastlurker, kids public education system do, probably IEP size phone book, require extensive supports kid fixed night, blamed schools. Or, job pays shit takes advantage you, suffer, everyone else too. I'm good teacher, profession allowed insulted, humiliated shit much ours. dont worry westcoast, won. spirit broken.

US's closest neighbor. tactic cold war 101. God hates people go hell. wanting vaccinated relieved stress that's burdening world half year now?

Think one needs help, quite bit Unfortunately parents... insisting Florida October. 

I tried tell worried health safety brush saying age want whatever want. per capita likely still less rampant highly populated states. don’t think rednecks ones spreading COVID much. town two colleges cases increased 500 within 2 weeks return... vast majority students affluent highly populated areas. Unless get capuchin monkey I'm out. I’m referencing study all. looking fact still averaging 750+ deaths day excess deaths like said well 200k, probably near 250k. Given 3 months even 500/day we’d another 45,000 deaths. we’d 300,000 jan 1, even assuming things get considerably better.

We’d still 2-3 months top hit 1 year since first death US. see us easily getting 350,000 sure corona fatigue set holidays year deadly. think simply venal, transactional approach government, like would find corrupt city hall mayor. Basically help us suck balls get want. Don't, get fucked over. even pretend valid reason. much shit flung far wide story went cold. link study showing symptoms flu similar rate higher.

""Please satisfy new criteria""? no? said flu causes fatigue heart damage, said didn't. Since agreeing does, add ""similar rate higher"" look like liar.

It tell something can't support without adding restrictions replies recieve. data per capita? Midwest states much smaller population looking per capita alone tell us real story. still likely cases states ate still lot higher lower percent overall population. Lol choose release *Loose Women*?! Seeing lot mid Michigan, 30 minutes Central Michigan University -SURPRISE! - outbreak resuming classes people locally eating restaurants, bitching bars closed. People go stores masks, interesting see many end around neck minute two later. 

I've stop using bunch local stores (grocery, hardware, even pharmacy) care mask wearing door - maybe. It’s human characteristic trait. American. r/ABoringDystopia I’m saying it’s possible change air 6 times/hr it’s unlikely. true typically classrooms bring 20% fresh air capable more, usually based CO2 levels. I’m air filter expert wouldn’t think it’s possible run typical air handler using filters woven tight enough filter covid. hospitals run patient care typical HEPA filters UV lighting. Pick food go park. 20'+ away folks. Kindly hand $5k say ""tough shit""... thanks, could use money right now. saw reddit comment got real thing,not placebo. that's reddit comment *Look voraciousness, barely get breath air turds stop him, let's see little troll manages choke feeds.*  
Om nom nom nom  link ELI5 explaining second wave one required happen? originally thought happened country/town thought everything good went back world like Philly 1918. that's case US like third fourth wave 'thinking everything fine trying get back normal'? Damn couple deaths day really newsworthy? Every death philippines people read news! population 120million, 4000+ death scared shitless here! guys population 3x 193,000 deaths! Almost 50x number deaths! Maybe every american death newsworthy maybe maybe lives could’ve saved! Ah okay, understand. 

I think ""getting food takeout order try help"" much better solution ""dine global pandemic, activity risks health safety everybody"" (hence reddit thread)

The solution perfect, think focus perfect solutions? be, imho, everything prevent stop spread, first foremost. (and maybe I'm crazy), everything else secondary. many hospitalized? one needs shipped -70C? Distribution might take figuring out. last movie saw theater Men Black (1). got free tickets work. 

I got first HDTV 1999, wired speakers reason go theater since. wait see movie comes DVD (or streaming, days) watch comfort home.

The reason go theater, outside social aspects, fan 'theater experience.

But experience, experience criminally overpriced snacks, Nokia Tune (again, last time '97) playing every 5 minutes ""turn ringer"" apparently impossible concept, half dozen people conducting real time narration one pause movie due super obnoxious moron accept could clearly seen throwing popcorn people screen illuminated theater required cops come remove him. 'really big screen' enough offset me. Tru dat. Stay strong. left house since March.

Well... mean we've done curbside shopping food needs.

And we've gotten doors exercise (walks, bikes, kayaks, etc) that's open spaces well away folks. Wow guy.. couldn’t fathom people concerned safety side effects viability pushed vaccine? Wow, holy fuck wow. obtuse someone be.

Easy, take deep breaths. assumed reason people go parties meet future girlfriends boyfriends become future spouses, maybe different UK?

In USA younger, met one long term girlfriends random ""house party"", got courage ask phone number dated year. one me, still think back fondly decided go party, talked cute woman, managed courage ""pull digits"" (it's old slang term buddy used said got phone number). regret NOTHING. party, would never met her, TON fun helped confidence time really needed emotionally. I'm worried allow house parties next 5 - 10 years, young people hookup fun point 20s, would sad miss on. 20s once, can't ever go back, trust this.

Maybe different UK 20 year old brits ever meet women house parties, mean upset you. Tbf technically teenager, that's undebatable favorite journalist! Fuck Sam Harris smear campaign saint.

Secondly, death rate appalling.

Thirdly, conservatives DGAF life much (The died Covid? Oh 32 obese diabetes, BROUGHT &amp; DEATH DESERVED!) opposed abortion? I’m IL don’t smallest numbers everyone def takes lot precautions. 

I don’t doubt disinfect I’ll ask anyway. Every house/street party mini festival attempt broken police since March organisers, performers, attendees complain fines. One organisers 3500+ party Cornwall week even called BBC complain government killing industry. Unfortunately reporter lapped get TV time ""against man"" digs instead punching guy dick telling fuck listen music gaff. stupid monkey! Might well make Trillion think mean October 31 commenter, but, It’s little obvious sarcasm... Every country wearing masks using track trace. poor countries least. Rich countries buy doses return normal poor countries fall apart, that's world works.  stupid americans dont closed borders them?!! Hey yall. need help. I'm debating two different grad schools, one social butterly covid outbreaks one commuter school that's relatively covid free. pandemic continues, would probably go covid free school, pandemic dies down, i'll probably attend party school.

What y'all think do? y'all think covid die August 2021? consistently 

Haha, no. I’m Jurong area go night cycles you’ll suddenly see mask compliance drop crazily. 

And also malls I’ve safentry people don’t even bother look you, shoot temperature gun (without checking temperature) wave through. 

As individual restaurants within malls, usually Safeentry either unenforced downright optional (as sign says “strongly encourage” check in), save big chains like McDonald’s.

We’re okay job overall, it’s means perfect. Amazing even 7 months ... People STILL can't see aggregate micro-clusters actions affect macro-picture HCPs emergency responders first. Next risk, talk least vaccines might safe give 80+ yo’s. they’ve done robust vaccine testing over-65 group, don’t think they’ll first either. 

So, people 65 high risk prioritized. Next IMHO teachers essential workers, like metro bus drivers. meat-plant workers.  sure restaurant experience consumer, delivery radius large delivery services like GrubHub post mates Uber eats. Dominoes deliver house directly, get Uber eats bring that’s end doing. yes it’s expensive probably makes lose money must familiar rather fun Uncle Sam sign too. It’s ASHRAE already authoritative get field. knew, charge bioterrorism mean that's Oregon Washington. Liberal bubbles surrounded red red red. Never denied it, I'm painfully aware. I'm Alaska, kind special like anywhere else. research shows well works COVID? become bit habit check numbers every day 14, might healthy one break eventually. bigger trends weekly updates suffice really. Trump mob? Show one ""trump mob"" looting setting fires.Just one. I'll wait. could work get quarantine protocols work locals aren’t gonna like it. They’re 1600 kms nearest cases Bris. suspect it’s another attempt NSW federal government make Palaszczuk look bad. Yes. still wear mask washing I’m going 2 stores relatively close leave car. Thanks talented friends relatives abundance masks washing really easy mild soap hot water sink recognize possibly excessive it’s easy enough anyway. many high risk people life otherwise. Ok, seems dense purpose, admit wrong. quote proves default accent. Honestly, I’m mad it. treat Covid patients it’s brutal. thought seen ugly deaths before, nothing ugly covid deaths I’ve had. Yes this. professionals still cooking better could home, you’ll get enjoy home. get recycle plastic containers instead washing dishes mentioned I’m actually teacher, unfortunately don’t choice stay home indefinitely. school board/superintendent empathetic towards us, barely giving us information saying come work resign. wasn’t even allowed take unpaid leave. really don’t give two shits us. organizers got fined

How much? Changing ""hellish"" ""one worst"" gave ground *to you*, ""hellish"" extreme description employee rights violations culture... Japan...

I disagree hellish conditions

I'm going argue definition conditions, going argue *precisely* bad US — think interested either. 

I point systemic issues (which US criticized for) sneaky hard spot, cultural issues seen rather easily, demonstrate. saying US workers nice feels much like defending US employee rights violations. We're way beyond that. agree worse many places. question. 

We think rights violations US systemically guilty overlooked better. progressivism. think better are. think even worse nations better do. hypocrisy, spoiled. forward-thinking acknowledgement plenty room grow. Saying room grow, uncomfortable idea sitting laurels simply people worse — progressivism mean think America bad. means want better. schengen entry ban, life.

she said fuck you, say fuck you.  think community service valid punishment?  It’s students. faculty staff put risk bunch kids don’t wear masks. couple Sailor Moon masks I’ve gotten compliments on, well kimono inspired prints! students gotten excited masks 😷 Merica #1 called community service many people favour instead jail time fines. Also Jewish, none us want anything fundamentalist crazies. 

In Israel basically sealed neighborhoods. try trust industrial dishwashers detergents, yeah would lying said hadn’t thought state, majority Sheriff’s publicly denounced mask mandate said enforce it. make things even better, live county County Board decided “sanctuary county” don’t follow mandate here. None major retailers voluntarily mandated masks even enforce people rabid wearing masks, it’s borderline dangerous say something. seems kinda authoritarian wholesome chungus 100 understand frustration feel 😓 see many people acting like COVID least social distancing mask wearing is. They're going gatherings family friends 10+ people social distancing. Happy hear government considering another lockdown sad hear needed. England fined 19yo college kid £10,000 (over $14,000) hosting party 50. 

Time fine church $100,000 per event, parishioners attend $1,000 each, every time go. Ok anddddd property taxes lol. 

So essentially we’re saving mortgage probably huge expense larger chains. wish we'd force Sweden...The vast majority idiots take seriously wear masks. massive increase testing capacity recently would suggest continuation first ""wave"". low point late June achieved less half number daily tests see now. never really suppressed enough begin qualify second ""wave"". read 13th amendment, pretty clear used form punishment. Like case know US Indonesia  mean like that... English basically second language Germans.

Sure, Americans loud it? second lockdowns... needed. 
Growing cases mean control. 
The US bit weird risk breaking healthcare *because americans healthcare*. 

In way, US never lockdown half population care even closest relatives, there's point saving people. 
The virus simply stay active kill people everyday, former superpower worldwide travel ban. 

You can't even count vaccine finally end it, get vaccined. Again, simply care reality future. pay medical costs ever get infected, pocket, insurance companies liable pay.. bankrupt them. Lived Puget Sound 40 years. 100% accurate. farther get sound redder dumber gets. Also Slovenia. 200€  Lol. That's new one. haven’t dined since March, tip 25% curbside delivery support. Add country israel second national lockdown. Spain growing cases havent. reason countries struggle survive two lockdowns. wasting places dont never terrible idea. need better plans useless lockdowns, like places like Korea. Lockdowns lazy cant make solid plan.    r/retarded Whatever. want freedumb. mention vaccines? Truly wondering.


I mentioned anti-vaxxers known anti-vaxxers leading protests measures slow Covid-19. Even simple things like masks social distancing. Like David Icke England Alex Jones U.S..


Yes, there's vaccine. stopped anti-vaxxers claiming global conspiracy use vaccine inject people nano bots. spout medicine promote snake oil crap. Blame Bill Gates anti science conspiracy crap.


Also 30-60% wanting vaccine rushed election day 100% anti-vaxxers, clearly there.  also telling groups praising 'warp speed', protesting masks, social distancing, lockdowns largest percentage people get vaccine.  This, good way take it. Since shit, it’s better test rushed vaccine us anyway. Wouldn’t want hurt anyone else. Per capita bad. Give weeks.  don't. That's science done. NEW: Changed reporting statistics covid-19

Data reported weekends delayed reporting system SmiNet. means data fully updated Mondays incomplete Tuesday. data complete Mondays, statistics covid-19 cases compiled Tuesday Friday Monday 14 September. statistics page continue updated 14:00 Tuesday Friday daily data. 

Data reported compiled reporting date SmiNet, means daily data reported afterwards even days update statistics page made. Weekly data updated 14:00 Thursdays. house street lot work done it. put sale 5 times bought for. Sold quickly. wish done. India indonesia made people dig graves janitorial work community service.

I 100% behind that. motherfuckers energy part kids pets? Grab shovel. Grab mop broom. Grab pointy stick clean trash beach park. 

This $10k dollar fine back breaking poor small inconvience affluent fuckers passed it. I'd like face plastered internet world see remember. 

But there's much important shit happening worldwide right now, it'll never happen. I'd settle getting actual jailtime. 

...but given cases COVID spreaders getting actual punishment been, doubt happen either. I'm going assume sarcastic... forgot /s Good idea. Actually, Europe locked time, exceptions (UK Sweden). 
I'm 100% sure France, Germany, Belgium, Italy impact witnessed. probably many others, unsure. 
The ones cases simply issued travel bans, making safe.

""Decisions made regionally"" NOPE! 
The virus care regions. 
What need coordinate effort. Even Belgium managed it, can't hard US. 
Else states ~~like Florida~~ *never* lockdown care many states infect. Good luck micro RNAs. It’s one difficult complex codexes regulate. Im sorry israeli average Israeli looks like. mention lol. 10% population religious keep see picture everytime someone bring israel lol medical science perverted politics profits. way trust anything coming us others vetted it. solely failure federal government. States cities can’t engage deficit spending way federal government can. pandemic caused overnight collapse state city income tax sales tax revenues, ironically way get revenues back re-open schools parents work. money local level massive expense like context sharp revenue shortfalls.

If need spend $1 million install ventilation systems every one ~100,000 schools country, need $100 billion federal aid package. McConnell thinks it’s cheaper let virus burn through. penalty fits crime well. Educational too. would basically equivalent Europe locked st time. Decisions made regionally. biggest mistake March locking states didnt need lock yet, making difficult lock later needed American. person would continue sound American. American accent. Get facts spouting nonsense. mRNA therapeutics development decade. COVID merely trigger implementation. Scientists stumble lab mid-March mix half-baked concoction hopes dreams unleash world. 
 people took time understand science rather listening media Facebook we'd much intelligent conversations vaccine. imagine teachers front cost buying bunch box fans put portable's windows try jury rig higher airflow. live north Philly, liberal suburbs become conservative rural areas state. I'd say we're around 85-90% mask wearing area. autoimmune disease makes long-term effects even mild covid really scary me. nose-pokers scare me. lack enforcement even among employees scares me. feel much fear anger daily basis. I'm stopping in-person shopping; much deal with. moved away Philly outbreak considered lucky dodged bullet high case numbers. Now, I'd give anything back.

(Edit: typo) Ahh New Zealand locked 6 weeks. know, there.... Reminds Band Brothers, every able bodied civilian village concentration camp forced dig mass graves prisoners died. Might well send gulag. Pfft, already start second Also Indonesian here, less refusing wear masks large density people public places, like train station. here? Well dropping, answer continue doing.

Why would drivers entering country park Kent? Everything pointing biggest landslide ever except last week electoral prediction shrunk slightly. ignore guaranteed blue tsunami. Interesting. without needing retrain/recertify pilot simulator, still issue? remember pre-pandemic still talking major simulator shortages going take basically forever retrain pilots, part dilemma get certified without forcing pilot retraining/recertifications without requiring make major hardware fix would cause regulatory issues delays. one actual history. still take age account making decisions like this. expect leniency 19-year old 39-year old.   我们的秘密协会知道，看过这篇文章的所有同志都是以中国政权垮台为目标的同志。

如果我们保持耐心，中国政权将崩溃。 Hint?  It’s confirmed. 19 fully grown adult lol hell would go for??? Fuck people thick!!!!!! yet realise americans honour really go together? happens movie villian scary. Shocker /s Transplant surgeons spend decades wearing mask 8-12 hours shot...to knowledge hasn’t indication “suffocation” amongst population. need fine like house parties UK. realize feel snug clever making remark, things consider:

- Swedes overwhelmingly support government theses policies.
- never closed schools kids 16.
- Swedes behaved responsibly, choose responsible adults, but-I-want-mah-freedoms idiots.
- death rate lower US

They fuck monumental scale like US still does.

EDIT: Reading previous comment meant sarcasm, I'll add this: ""...and forget it"" definitely Swedes did. chose responsible follow advice without forced so. Exactly. may write submit ""journal"" require peer review. feel like people need consider possibility share social media platforms. else people living lives virus going kill them? another logical explanation.

To support theory - sort parasite drives insects expose colonies spreads parasite. unprecedented. vaccine earliest getting approved early 2021. India absolutely huge, manufacturing enough doses population take atleast year.


Treatments going snail pace aswell.


India poor country, lockdown effects kill people virus itself. Lmao fuck would article today's metrics written metrics released? I'm sick media point. think brave appreciate risk took see different approach works out. energy desire try understand whatever typed up, I'm sure enjoyed time spent it. Enjoy rest day. scary thought uninformed allowed manage informed name democracy. exactly Plato disliked democracy, nothing worse uninformed masses, including ourselves, dictating direction informed. Nope, antibody tests tell already Covid past couple months. Rapid diagnostic tests tell sick. Even studies may hint this, matter. Vaccines protection first foremost children vector virus. that's thought well went theater Friday. Public servants held higher bloody standard 19 year old house party first home outside halls. Cummings absolutely worse. think though lot older people keep touch family. family bother? would hope would strengthen ties forced communicate outside fed info. “by October “ Sept 30? Yes do, we’ve missed opportunity need vaccine reach herd immunity, needless say vaccine hugely preferred Project Moonshot farce, never going happen. America think COVID real? Come guys wake it’s COVID killing people ffs!!!!! know least 150 people who’ve gotten it. deaths far . I’m worried . Person black too. Try serving meal costs least €9. That's Irish government solved Covid pubs restaurants here. virus targets cheap/poor Meanwhile people family really left house since March appears able many months thanks idiots bit help stop thing. He's even saying they'll show works October makes point saying might not. He's saying there's good chance they'll know *if* works then. ......well yeah need make disease go extinct. Otherwise people literally die. caveats argument:

- big one Swedes tend live normal life somewhat socially distant anyway, hard thing transpose countries cultures. 

- beyond culture, physical spacing people tight high density areas. needs figured somehow. people want take vaccine let get sick. get tested here. Jeez, fuck. let Americans country grasp Flu Epidemic WW1 Balkanization, I... know say except GO READ MORE, NITWIT. wrote that. original. could found Google search. apparently chose do. 

You responded like literally nothing else say. quite understand comment point

maybe I'm stupid Nice! :-) chiropractors ""tempting"" quick fix. quick fix fix all, know several PT's tirelessly explain physical therapy slow results stay, chiros prey fact people want quick fixes.  haven’t seen data disproving that. COULD true. Someone needs make article title. “Does Covid destroy fear center brain?” way question mark, simply say researchers don’t know, might even study it. get lots clicks. Yeah, I've heard lot people suggest virtually every indoor environment ""but go away!"" realistic. high school air conditioning rooms windows (they opening yet even though towns around us are.) one day saw bunch guys hazmat suits behind plastic sheet... found asbestos. first time either.

So many school buildings bad condition is. really possible. :-) hey country totally broken compensates staff restaurants, result, need risk health safety others eating restaurants

I aware solution perfect, think proposal ""eat restaurant help bus boys"" dangerous irresponsible Good you. Please don’t open awhile Using humans. would wear mask drinking / eating? gloves pointless Legislate it, enforce strap hefty fine followed. Like US? 😡 second US even done first! Apparently article written today's numbers released, since updated. yes, new cases deaths trending now. hospitalizations 70% peak, per article. comments, sub peculiar fetishization doom gloom. government total failure. argument isn’t number people, it’s *timeline*. Vaccines usually take lot longer observe people years. side effects take years manifest. 3 month study won’t tell vaccine causes long term birth disagree that. need go beyond we're gonna wind right again.

You're describing critical stenosis proximal left anterior descending artery. I'm pointing patient still smoking like fucking chimney. arterial blockage causing heart attack, caused arterial blockage? Oh, agree government stacked bunch self-serving lying bastards, initial confusion transmission methods. Remember sanitizing groceries, mail, etc? 

There's also strong anti-establishment/educated elite thing adding layer.

American's resistance masks quite multi-faceted.  they’re heavy spreaders. 


Y’all always leave reason. Last checked, preferred wear grey. Fine/arrest violating sorts laws/regulations?

Land free, allow go judges ruling whim. 

If violate restraining order someone, get away walking front thier house saying ""it's free country, stalk want"" ventilator it’s probably allergies lockdown cut infection rates sure, unless vaccine 100% guaranteed (which isn’t) effective treatment (which isn’t either) second lockdown move problem road unless achieve zero Covid inevitable resurgence coronavirus, IFR 0.56% dropping still I’m ok another lockdown Would say opinion common amongst peers? Or, honestly speaking, outlier? Genuinely curious much respect opinion feelings toward this. think deeper that. scared shitless real want deny reality. Deep know real cope.  Nah. Conspiracy people gonna do. Shrouding mystery allows make almost anything plausibly. Well, slightly better. least someone taught word use besides troll. Unfortunately, you, worded way make seem speaking likes turd gobble. probably accident, it? Considering pathetic shit comes mouth, shit goes must equally unpalatable. Hey actually question you, someone UK. Obviously news America super US-centric go youtube watch European news Europe's second wave. keep hearing even news people ask deaths hospitalizations going yet. American know answer this. Similar Europe, summer epidemic began young partygoers. takes time spread vulnerable population. takes time vulnerable need hospitalized, succumb. people really know this? not, point really needs driven home. mean US went like 300 deaths day, way back almost 2000 day. Europe see happen well. 4% actually dovetails theory mine.... wonder people particularly afraid covid already covid brains destroyed know terrified. Honest question, team believe wearing masks? think since got it, they're free whatever? No, stupidity age limit. Would like push stool? Eh amount people end giving rides I’d rather take chance case didn’t clean car well enough. I’m afraid even breathing now. Even house. spouse might know. many factors go this. families running around town antimask even enforced certain stores. Friends visiting friends knowing it, assume cold. stupid teenagers like host huge parties. No, beyond wearing masks point. half population wearing half not, normal vicious cycle while. long? Nobody knows. *Exactamente*. People completely agree Fauci's science disagree risk assessment going cinema. many factors go this. families running around town antimask even enforced certain stores. Friends visiting friends knowing it, assume cold. stupid teenagers like host huge parties. No, beyond wearing masks point. half population wearing half not, normal vicious cycle while. long? Nobody knows. quoting per capita number... Bureau Labour less 76,000 meat plant workers

Here [mine production workers assumed (maybe wrongly) number higher 2020 2010. Covid Mary. Gotta love entitlement. don’t think know word ‘majority’ means. Nah, glorious leader pick best choice based private interests, populist fuck :( [Yankee Go badly want vaccine, theres way hell I'd take first one that's approved. Probably even second. Maybe third. rapid Covid test rapid antibody test thing? called urgent care said don’t “rapid Covid tests” it’d take 3-10 days get results back.  feel like crap want get tested...I’m thinking determine test need easier find places them. travel us talking travel bans. stationed Germany while, vacation Greece, came back got tested showed symptoms. went pub crawl would typically agree 100% giving much information people can’t understand detrimental situation. info could released “simplified” form could help would still people claiming whomever “simplified” either lied wrong. level entitlement people beyond belief. hope karma finds treat justice. Time [significant vaccine 
Time [ramp COVID 
Time [develop better treatments cut mortality

If India total deaths per population US right would 800 000 dead instead 78 500. agree 100% Jesus plenty say caring neighbor applicable situations.

But problem one quite believe scope pandemic hand MacArthur quoted saying something along lines of: ""the cdc decided come forth real numbers, 6% ""deaths"" actually virus."" (Mindblowingly dumb, clearly shouldnt giving medical advice, simply understand situation works)

The problem is, harder mentally think murder, directly killing them...

I think these, combined healthy dose ""I care anyone myself"" whole pandemic stopped like rest world. (heck country fully checked this, pandemic might dissappear whole country)

I'm incredibly disappointed church whole right now. could ministering, helping need, thier agenda self centered is. 

The reality is, church behaved jesus-like, authoritarian level shenanigans going on, trying stop christianity existing. people would fight them, cause would huge benefit society. right now, jesus-like thier interactions society, everyone hates them. Selfish, hateful, stupid. list goes even welfare! insurance! Chinese vaccine Sinopharm. I'm UAE many volunteered,around 31 thousand, phase 3 trial started two months ago. first participant chairman Abu Dhabi health authority based results safe participants tested positive antibodies. Next prioritize giving vaccine doctors,nurses emergency staff rest population. infect two groups people disease march, six months later 1000 people died group 100 people died group B - chances overall community spread much higher first group. Meaning check immunity month 7, you’ll see higher rate immunity group A. even discussing? vaccination Feb-Mar 2021 absolutely feasible.

Expand logistics that. Poorly maintained buildings. impossible say photo people quite blurry. Kudos matching shirt/cart lady. Anyway, point is... reading much usage stock photography. flu strain going recommend analysing southern hemisphere winter outbreaks.

So Australia+nz+south africa get recommendations? always guinea pigs? vaccine 50-60% effectiveness leaves at-risk people healthcare workers danger, especially everyone else decided longer need practice social distancing. Never life claim useless, weak, pathetic piece shit. * blame Darrens equally. Park bathrooms take lives beg differ.
And reducing depression sadness cool. get people get flu shot normal year, least important year ever get flu shot.

From heard important get flu shot year ensure hospital beds taken flu cases available COVID. Normal US include putting kids cages, killing black people reason letting 200k people die, okay, small government good ""AstraZeneca's AZN.L COVID-19 vaccine trial remains hold United States pending U.S. investigation serious side effect Britain even trials vaccine resume, sources familiar details told Reuters. "" You’re quoting said paraphrase statement mischaracterization. Plus masks public prohibited except specific instances, comments replying statement already pointed out. point.. top government measures provide enough benefit offset damage cause.

Every single outbreak US shows absolutely necessary. Even something simple masks requires government mandate large segment population Sweden fared compared nordic countries complicated topic. define ""comparable?""

Any them? Denmark significantly higher population density make much susceptible infectious disease much better, economically fatalities. Projection real thing. shaming people extra cautious way projecting uncomfortable feelings onto you, trying make problem. Us humans (I want say Americans I'm sure extends elsewhere) typically taught okay wrong, uninformed, uncomfortable. understood feelings teach themselves, shame blame others.


I'm sorry work people maybe considering life valued theirs. would burry dead week seen inside closed space mask. lower numbers teach survivors tell others due ptsd. wish they'd here. Maybe make start caring little? like lol Totally unnecessary word lockdown title. anymore... Like Los Angeles Wisconsin rises cases following protests. Totally unrelated though believe body autonomy? media scared young people thinking gonna ventilator die venture outside. you’re 40 almost nothing worry about.

If you’re worried spreading well choose stay inside eternity keep grandma alive, don’t expect happy. ever talking US prison labour system? community service. made claims prison labour either against. anti-union here, anti-management. snowflake exemption terrible policy. Yeah, except municipalities zero authority enforce this. Needs banned state federal level. No, might hurt customer, get sued. Corporate cares money. Corporate wants defensive weapon use stores done police officers immunity lawsuits, employees don't. Corporate wanted run away instead pulling knife. Mexico, Spain, Southern/Western US showing similar curves. UK, Northeast US, Canada show similar curves.

It's easy predict country hit hard currently based climate. Yes that's point... perceived first glance reputable also nations easily manipulated, would forced agree whatever US tell them, want continue sustaining economic military alliance us. want graves dug Indonesian anti-maskers? 'A good number' obscure fuck. mean 5%? 20%? made claim, back up. Pass. want see idiots kill act surprised. Full reopen aren't, two feel stupid making comparison. Man, mix world, ultimate goal every average Serb still Switzerland, southeners love Sweeden. nice weather moist, even chovolate better Belgium. Sorry :) determine spread without contact tracing certain events?

By measuring total number measured cases see large change data. 

If jump cases, matter contact sourced from, it...it increase. would absurd think cases remained consistent trends also saying protests caused surge (you'd exactly equal drop cases non-protest scenarios keep overall trend consistent). Genuine question: Europe widespread mask mandates they’ve unable stop second wave cases rapidly occurring. think would able help Arizona? Comments like sounds like someone wants encourage Americans wave white flag give up.

You're tired. tired. give up. live US ancestors gave everything come search better life children. gave homes, comfort native language, status community. often never saw parents coming new York boat, bus trip Kansas City. great migration, black people Georgia saved money year buy train ticket Detroit find work freedom Jim Crowe. 

Yes tired within us strength courage ancestors sacrificed years years living tenements tight quarters working 14 hours day. 

My grandfather see family two years washed dishes slept couch saving 3 tickets send wife two sons.

We give up. ever. 

Certainly measly six months. It’s even effective shield. hope get criticized terrible design. relate. know fully understand, relate.

On bright side, make panic attack. know tough get moment, always try remember make make through.

And keep M.D. shame, mentally health really given care physical health is. Far often either end docs want drown meds give anything despite clear continuing decompensation. middle ground approach rare. Coupled inherent nature anxiety, really, really frustrating -- say least. 

Good luck here's hoping better days us. people caught attacking people black, least America. super likely conservative. trials already no? Bless trying. Patience peace wonder likely - people idea it, people thinking cold flu last spring.

Exactly. doubt 14% US population currently it. actually seems lowball estimate.

On hand, anecdotally feel like everyone thinks definitely lol specify, want provide source Democrat pushing/passing/supporting law restricts right self-defense? asking for?  absolutely should.. call main dr explain psych explain.. come cold turkey long time borderline malpractice IMO. Benzo W/D one W/D syndromes actually cause death. want alarm grandmal seizures bad things happen. really dependant long them, dosage personal body chemistry.. coming benzos awhile almost always something done dr supervision. Better sad dead They’re asking notes. I’m sure many doctors would write notes, anyway. 

Getting fired isn’t thing employee needs protection from. looks like China route, glad government able make tough call right thing. Whoever wants vaccine right away get one

Not true. all. Admit it! mixed Sweden Switzerland. Come on. won’t tell. :-) No, obscure, good number people can't function normally anymore. Also, study lung nerological damage asymtomatic cases even, mild. subscirber walled.

They fired engaging self defense, fired weapon premises. Lol silly. AIDs, bubonic plague, Ebola, SARs also acceptable. compare flu cold(another coronavirus). FOH Maybe everyone vaccine least healthcare workers at-risk people it, would solve majority issues factor immunity already got sick recovered. you’re acting like nothing wrong telling go therapy stating facts make uncomfortable. You’re either sociopath, moron, both. see difference 17% number avg tests done April May. link posted test done June it’s Unless..? source? quoting spider-man directed Raimi lol Yes. trust SVT **a lot more**. wasn’t intending get discussion actual topic. concluded shitty source using. 

There doubt mistakes made Swedish nursery homes. Probably quite few. I’m happy inquiry/investigation made.

Your comment elderly sent hospital true also beside point. point got adequate care not, matter got hospital home. cases think get adequate treatment others obviously didn’t. investigation show big issue first crazy coronavirus months. Okay moral story is: work shitty companies wont allow defend yourself. talking grown ass man attacked women twice. bribe money property much streamlined. asking forgiveness. fact, things regret life things do. I’m pretty sure it. Got pneumonia, chest pain, shortness breath back March. Even experienced hair loss June. can’t really remember lost taste don’t think so. Symptoms started 10 days went hockey game. wasn’t able get tested way tested negative tested (read you’re likely get false negative test late idk thats true?) People around ended getting sore throats fine overall.

Edit: I’d like add also working really closely someone travelled Europe right incubation period. left right got sick word whether sick not. can’t confirm imagine also increased viral load. different virus though. study waits peer review damage heart cells, pretty fast obscure vaccine data well, continue, 3/4 get long term effects, another study sperm count...

Your interpretation law incorrect. idiot would specifically go tell people they’re wearing avoid facial recognition. Living nearby, don’t think placer ever really enforced rules reopening, least significant way. Many businesses course moved outdoor dining wasn’t uncommon see people pushing things. 

However, mask use stores seems become pretty good foothill counties, least commercial settings mandate stores requiring kicked in. 

Now placer joins number counties indoor dining, gyms, indoor activities (at small capacity theoretically). case yet really spike el dorado South Lake Tahoe fingers crossed.

LOL used dread going sometimes. I’d love either group now! Haven’t seen since mid-Feb; contact IG fb, it’s it’s need, describe well: energy room get there’s ***at least*** ten you.

I think we’ll concerts next summer. 🤞 Next tell care nurses doctors hospital staff :P Florida? pulled pocket knife DEFEND herself. Corporate care decided employees hit, stabbed, shot etc without defending cause might hurt CuStOmEr assaulting them. sort happens people feel like national leaders politicizing vaccine and/or rushing roll out. great example suspicious data found Russia's vaccine trials. USA florida show example this? Truth hurts! apparently also effective salt generator. Corporate investment Canada declines every year. Corporate Income taxed jurisdictions take advantage tax legislation. New business attract need generous tax concessions. rich abandoning us look like?

Car plants closing billions support...... Sounds like annual flu shot routine.  Bad bot good news. need protecting Bingo. This. husband baby still isolating. miserable really emotionally taxing. frustrated people throwing massive parties, debating masks, overall selfish turds. People dying! me- fact son cannot meet anybody abundance caution- directly fault selfish types America infuriating. 

We could beat 2 times unified efforts. president ass deserves capital punishment deaths he’s directly caused. course accent, spoke could tell from. Generally notice accent everyone around sounds same. Remember though police tried shut first disburse party. fine issued refused cooperate, police abused back called. 

I don’t feel sorry him. localized, reflective Indonesia

The capital lockdown starting today. governor orders lockdown explicitly stated local mass prayers still allowed.

The president said lock entire cities like that

There's another local ""punishment"". caught without mask forced stay coffin 15 minutes lieu 30 minutes community service (sweeping roads). Everyone chose coffin 15 minutes faster involves physical labor

That's Indonesian thinking right Yeah, avoid things could kill people I'm fucking self-centered. vaccine could harmful worsen condition. Without proper testing simply know. ""just effective"".  That's whole story. many th medical community never wanted released remain island life. also experimental treatments try cure her. great docu drama mean bad thing? common decency wear mask need go you’re sick long term effects, effects much worse pain

The whole point vaccine short, sharp shock immune system get respond. immune system stopped responding, whatever mechanism used introduce vaccine left body, there's reason expect lasting harm. We're inventing vaccination scratch - we're optimizing way trigger response new pathogen.

There's certainly risk-based justification examining effects vaccine many years decades pandemic on.

Anything worse short-term pain, fever, etc., rare would picked sufficiently large Phase III. big problem that, declaring Phase II output finished product, incredibly difficult raise objections make changes based whatever learned actual Phase III, even number vaccines distributed similar. know? One reason field dominated women. Studies show men start enter profession wages rise. also fund public institutions well general, including public education. many pro plaguers sub right now. disgusting. lets forget governaments value economics us one reason vaccinate ( least first batch). mods great job all.  Lol Im anti vax ever people honestly expect vaccinate corona virus?

Let explain mean:

1. vaccine probably rushed going give body test subject free.

2. Since pandemic started saw economics keeping economic machine going priority human life well realized politicians really dont give shit us.

3. attack selfish one respectfull guys always wears mask even go check mail. one already wore masks early february measures asked. think serious doubt it.

So fuck vaccine. speechless companies economy general matters individuals. most

Define this. idea arguing against. think plan perfect, it'snot workable? There's always one guys every post even remotely China. What's secret? underground cabal dudes rolling around post passive-aggressive suspicious comments China? Where? New Zealand resurgence. China lying.  unironically, get fucking plague rats away normal people  wear mask outside

Does include backyard? front porch? see arbitrary stupid is? Eventually someone say, ""yeah, pointless wear it."" people reach threshold sooner sadists would want employ cruel unusual punishments. Um, is. tourism travel Europe US pandemic control US. flew nearly-empty plane US. They're Phase III. involves Russia. worst thing could happen effective virus spread gets worse. Worth specifying antibody tests.

So:

1. Presence, least lasting presence antibodies seems correlated severity symptoms;
2. Mask wearing Korea and/or younger exposed population - lots church services nightclub exposure young participants - could led much milder cases overall (less initial viral load meaning disease defeated immune system quickly);
3. Loss antibody presence equal ""loss immunity"" suggested translated article; *may* would expect memory cell immunity even without antibodies — although studies urgently needed. see top article author is, ahem, ""Senior Research Fellow, Biostatistics, University Sydney"". dream 1/20th knowledgeable field is, know basic calculus. number new cases very, much *not* ""same"" rate change new cases. Far it. graph number new cases versus time (days) ""rate change"" first derivative ie *slope* graph. give simple analogy graph speed car time speed given instant tells little, first derivative tells much car accelerating. 

So, first derivative tell researcher rate change, whether cases increasing MUCH increasing decreasing. can't tell anything crude numbers. driving accelerating car might quite useful knowing take foot gas even brake want make tight curve half mile ahead. 

What guy far involved sort basic calculus involves things like second order derivatives (what rate change rate change much, much more), going face massive fines local authorities (up 2000€) breaking ordered quarantine. 

The local business owners also entitled bring charges civilian courts damages businesses. may also possible felony charges reckless endangerment causing bodily harm heading way.

 least said morning radio commute work. understand. minor inconvenience wearing mask much important people’s lives.  

“YOU TAKE LIVES, YOU’LL NEVER TAKE MAH ‘MURICAN FREEDUMB!” Mexico too. Incompetent governments.  ofc. also, there's part implanting plug automatic stick insertion rotation motion. sure familiar balcan customs here: encourage sick people WFH? would rather believe Russia china point. would say vaccine side effects, like pain, fever, chill etc. 


But agree cutting corner getting ahead irresponsible. long term effects, effects much worse pain? wear outside house. Even motorbike. worked extremely well first time... rushed allowed kids back schools ruined it. 

I hope learned do. first lockdown worked extremely well. nearly beat privlidged

Check privilege.

^^^BEEP ^^^BOOP ^^^I'm ^^^a ^^^bot. ^^^PM ^^^me ^^^to ^^^contact ^^^my ^^^author. majority cases people get virus without needing additional medical care. People hospitalised manage symptoms cure them.

This pretty typical viral infections. Agreed. China faked numbers would still people seeing actually happening telling it.

China actually handling situation professionally. Fairly sure China got ahead this. Can't near extinction China survives. agree main thrust saying: generally test diagnose flu cases either. people see doctor, and/or doctor assumes flu based symptoms rather viral samples.

Our assumptions prevalence Covid good, better, flu. \~6M confirmed cases Covid US, know likely number true infections 20M 100M (with varying degrees improbability). 

With 6M flu diagnoses, would assume roughly 60M cases IFR, again, true number could different. If, 6M diagnoses, ended 6,000 deaths, we'd CFR 0.1% IFR 0.01%. \~200k deaths Covid, gives us 3% CFR IFR 0.3-1%. 

We range data therefore ""know"" (at least extent knowledge flu confounding factor) much deadly Covid flu. broad range ""no idea"" Covid knowing everything flu epidemics.

Israel's second national lockdown that's first kind.

I super excited it, yes would vegan. whole point need animal product survive(or thrive matter) therefore unjustified take freedom life. 

However sometimes to, survive. example medication. justified. think vast majority vegans would agree statement. course people different view like movements.

Further buying medication tested animals, really increase demand animal testing, since mandated laws. Boycotting makeup tested animals however impact vegans would purchase those.

PS: feel like clarify. animal tested medical product vegan labeled, people consuming would still vegan (if need survive significantly worse quality life.) Good Indonesia this. People want risk lives selfish carelessness, get punished it.  Digging graves really help message sink in.

That means virus would lot older analysis mutation shows, antibody protection non-existent extremely short-lived, elderly populations Italy would exposed similar-enough yet unknown coronavirus point past, reinfection possible highly likely. 

Months line, seem anyone else behaved like Italy. reinfection primary cause severity outbreak, would see rise CFR summer, fall.

So: might caused it? Non-expert views here:

1. Italy probably virus circulating earlier anywhere else Europe, certainly larger numbers;
2. worst-hit areas ski zones - helping spread disease elsewhere. think ski bars, they're perfect: located small towns built mountainsides, population winter much larger. going much crowded typical bars elsewhere (real estate expensive can't filled visitors 6-8 months year, plus either support buildings stilts, flatten land, build scarce plateau), lots people coming slopes covered snow, melts raises humidity indoors. high R number.
3. Multi-generational living; elderly parents grandparents living children adult grandchildren, meaning many opportunities older people exposed, higher viral loads once-a-week, distanced visit cup tea;
4. older population generally;
5. happening without detection social distancing, meaning Covid testing either possible considered necessary. testing possible, rightly prioritized severe cases, meaning CFR roof. Get outta here, Germans zero hostility towards English speaking folks. English basically second language Germans. Slaughter house. better supporting biological warfare?

To evaluate antiviral potential extract, pre-treated virus particles cells evaluated remaining infectivity limited dilution. Furthermore, exposed cells extract infection evaluate potential prophylaxis treatment coronaviruses. also determined protective effect Echinaforce® re-constituted nasal epithelium.

### Results

In current study, found HCoV-229E irreversibly inactivated exposed Echinaforce® 3.2 μg/ml IC50. Pre-treatment cell lines, however, inhibit infection HCoV-229E post-infection treatment marginal effect virus propagation 50 μg/ml. However, observe protective effect organotypic respiratory cell culture system exposing pre-treated respiratory epithelium droplets HCoV-229E, imitating natural infection. observed virucidal activity Echinaforce® restricted common cold coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 MERS-CoVs inactivated comparable concentrations. Finally, causative agent COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 also inactivated upon treatment 50μg/ml Echinaforce®. Yea, like ""study,"" ""trial,"" ""inhaled"" back back back. Seems messy me. Emoji allowed titles.

Literally part conversation. Whatever though honestly support getting politics every subreddit thank you. Masks baby vaccines mean would called manslaughter culpable homicide countries. legal precedent prosecuting someone spreading infectious disease except case prosecuted intentionally spreading HIV England (and none requirements met here). support charges spread potentially lethal infections (flu, rhinoviruses, MRSA, syphilis etc.)?

Even prosecution possible, would direct link person spread virus victim (with proof almost impossible find)

And populace working-age largely healthy (a major difference Spanish flu targets different demographic). people even symptoms. we're done first wave six months I'd surprised. Globally, given speed communications, nearly every single country made hash implementing sort reliable exit strategy.

We thank dude/dudette upstairs fatality rate low (it downvote pile on)  SARS never reached pandemic level. Also different symptom timeline rapid mutation dead ended itself. 

This unlikely happen COVID-19 widespread is. likely time mutation downwards human gaining immunity infection/vaccination become lower level endemic disease causes nasty cold like OC43 coronaviruses. always novel thus lose edge. also nature RNA viruses deleterious. benefit killing host. 

COVID-19 going anywhere. always novel virus causing severe disease many patients. ""authoritarian"" countries manpower, infrastructure, technology China.

The main issue Western countries public political will. COVID parties, anti-lockdown protests, politicization anti-pandemic measures basically unheard China, Korea, Taiwan, countries success containing spread.

HK ironically issues ""pro-Democracy"" factions trying sabotage anti-pandemic process attempt make HK government look bad. burned test clinics, vandalized quarantine centers, incited strikes politicized medical staff, launched movement boycott city-wide (e.g. know, shit expect American far-right pull)/. also ironically, get far since CCP power (guess evil right side time). Let's make trending social media fucking pessimistic article subreddit. china asymptomatic covid plane kansas city seattle someplace china. mom dad didnt kid did. timing 5 days since plane ride. 

It's hard imagine plane infection little kids can't wear masks. also mum dad get it. partisan

I keep getting told he's politician Republican really pointing bad decisions partisan political, right?  think gripe would media people choose share, Dr. Fauci himself. seen numerous times talking importance mental health. also loudest voice telling people go outside, social distance mask wasn’t possible stay 6 ft apart. can’t upset clickbait titles read. agree! also noticed slipping bit, minus mask. really hard exhausted stuff, people really need try. South different schedule Northeast US Britain. comparable Mexico basically undergoing curve Southern states. Would really hard say ""This SAE wasnt caused vaccine, here's data nerds""? Russian disinformation I'm even American. xenophoby seem norm lot subs reddit, unfortunately. fucking shame. PA excellent containing this. lived one earliest hit spots PA taken seriously clearly worked. old county sees less 15 new cases day, usually 10. Maybe 1/3 participants starting second month. Another 1/3 started. final 1/3 still started. Already called hospital last week schedule date time come get one since they're walk-ins year obvious reasons. long time since I've flu shot, preventative measures take benefit myself, healthcare workers well, I'm for. right..in specs better. provide protections however. Yep, I'm similar position, although underlying health issues aware of. 

I agree first vetted vaccines go populations benefit greatest them, want used guinea pigs, either. vetted safe effective, yes, populations receive vaccinations first rest us wait turn.

It's mentally exhausting, I'm okay continuing socially distant, wear masks take precautions enjoy fun things little longer. Especially understand everyone privilege that. people go work around unsafe people (those physically violent asked wear mask, example). get much, best individual cut overall workload, know?  retail workers carry box cutters retail jobs shit provide . small, enough jump increases. 
Seriously, documented (thankfully less life-threatening issues) many people see fine merely price pay following rules/laws rest us follow willingly. START $10,000 go there, maybe, maybe, might work. Maybe. Ron. double take myself. Yep, NPR also story him. kind insane - dude walking alarm bell warning potential mask issues, Trump administration kept hitting snooze.  works Canada.

And Alaska too, might false-negative lifelong lung, heart organ problems, disabilities cause dependency. would depend local behavior. Contact tracing, mask usage, etc.

R value virus directly relates herd immunity, since herd immunity threshold calculated directly R Local authorities named American description mid 20s american X bar X day might connect dots hard time contact tracing everyone due stupidity going bar crawl symptomatic. Garmisch small place hopefully description helps make contact people might infected. moron needs fining deporting bet start using Benford’s curve new data. could probably detect manipulation. Extended family Shanghai, one densest cities China, open months. includes restaurants, movie theaters, amusement parks, etc. outbreak, would way contain it, would spread like wildfire. also shown reduce risk getting strains Coronaviruses, surprise helped little. important note MHRA (UK drug regulator) well ""independent safety review committee"" (not entirely sure who's committee) also gave go-ahead trial continued. Also today, Brazilian authorities gave go-ahead trials continue Brazil too.

This still transparency, get wrong. think aware politics corruption influence safety committees too. However, _all_ review boards, two countries? I'm fully willing believe really see data good.

...But still substitute public knowing more, agree Lowe whatever pitfalls are, need great right now. point going realize people brainwashed don’t care things do? 

It’s questions like everywhere. accept people gone go vote. know UW WHitewater, UW Stout collect fall tuition early October. regular surgical masks BC almost $50 50. mom gave pack bought back right shit started, price still, $8.99. Yea...numbers starting look good live. son's school open week we've kept son home see things go sending back. sky apocalyptic week, air semi-toxic month. 

The think keeping going every day brain seeing minute improvements going, ""maybe things better next week."" 

Part knows probably won't, hope next week, maybe next month, things better keeps functioning. respect Fauci followed recommendations everything, hearing level doom gloom helping me. Seems like national security threat giving one country much power. would good time look diversify production world isn’t reliant India That's great keep years, personally want suffer decades depression aftermath extended social isolation. I'm already struggling feelings hopelessness, lack motivation, sadness almost daily basis. outweighs tiny risk would have, person 20s, severe covid. Yeah get make call. I’m sure many universities started year person! figure got hand go online don’t lose enrollment tuition! It’s always money. Hey reddit user, another reddit user agrees you. Repetition way children (and living beings) learn. preach every day reason, people chose stop listening moment said something like made feel bad. people practice craft every, single day? that's tried true way getting better. 🤷🏻‍♀️ northeast, significant portion schools built 1950s. HVAC present, heat only. 

I think assumption regional, best. Try GABA. ibs diverticulitis ibs. Black coffee black tea upset guts. like green teas sometimes make poop ( cramps go ). found taking gaba really helped guts.

Also maybe work food intolerances. can't eat lot onions example..

I've taking nexabiotic supplement helped too. thanks taking vaccine trust production Oh Geez. That’s lot money. 

I gonna go Wal Mart’s delivery. hate corporation one three stores small town already pick there. It’s like $12 month unlimited delivery. Kroger uses instacart...so, question costs darn much extra.

Thanks heads that. :) They've confirmed transmission taking place plane? remember correctly, fauci said viruses actually get weaker time historically starts beeping everyone evacuate restaurant immediately. horse high, seem riding donkey. Again, exactly happened American south around month major outbreaks. Cases first creep younger people far less likely need hospitalization inevitably infect others, get deaths.

And repeating exactly deniers said then. point entirely predictable. Denmark probably enforced heavy measures early pushing cases ahead gave better chance prepare learn countries.

 early evaluate tactics country made right choices

As a.swede hope Denmark keep well! Well, you’re absolutely sure agree, there's reason panic there's also reason pretend everything alright.   think sadistic ghouls work ICE give rats ass people lock dog cages dying? They're probably thrilled virus saving effort. talk mental health professional Favre born it'd make sense. Feature, bug. Yeah, lot stuff personal risk assessment. go gym, I've gotten two haircuts pandemic era know that's outside comfort/risk zone people.

It's people breaking state guidelines problems it. Like clubs supposed half capacity packed gills. I've also got 'not monkey, zoo' approach things point. exactly feel, problem sacrificing short term old fucks like professor get vaccine mass produced years, ones grandma important 1. said high school?
2. Extremely rare. also get injured die things every single day. giving non-serious reply, almost quite ""/s"". Sweden lot confirmed cases per capita despite testing far less per capita denmark. Neither country healtcare systems overwhelmed Sweden several thousand dead Denmark not. Thats comes across fairly obvious. Im actually happy guys better. state governments Fucked up. Central government fucked giving powers state govts. good thing government done testing. widely available. dont even know happen school reopens. people actually obeying social distancing rules. Every body weres mask here. dont even know cases going up. Anyway hows press freedom Pakistan? Especially foreign media?
Ps. trust anything indian media says Pakistan vice-versa. Even people die though show evidence organ damage. need admitted pretty likely suffer kind organ damage.

Even asympto cases like college athletes showing heart inflammation. want catch covid all. Antivaxxers make way less 30% population. 30% population says get vaccine. another 10-20% cautious soon get it. Yeah, although media reports covered mostly rich. seems like poor immunity? 什么时候把 /china 夺回来啊 Actually, FL statewide mask law order. Thanks, DeSantis.

&amp;#x200B;

Source: future blue voting mask wearer FL childhood development experts many articles cite keep referring importance socialization young, primary school-aged, children reason send back in-person classes. 

I'm sure experts understand inherent contradiction recommendation: students returning school, wearing face masks 7-8 hours day, required maintain social distance, sharing small-group activities, prohibited ""normal"" interactions classmates socialization anyone want children experience. 

More ""normal"" interaction - - occur kids properly networked &amp; engaged online learning. yet see real scientific evidence this. I'm denying people may long-term consequences. sceptical whole idea ""longhaulers"". Lots highly varying symptoms. Loads even ever positive tests. lot psychosomatic. caveat vaccine available. Otherwise, government playing games children's lives. part, subs stick newly graduated teachers trying get foot door, retired teachers supplementing income.

I’m degreed professional, work - I’ve kicked around idea subbing, dunno. It’s worth it’s not? Sure. see previous examples physically prevented opening restaurant also large fines.

If close restaurant can't afford fines government levying me, restriction free will. WANT open restaurant CAN'T, because... can't tell quite appropriate place ask I'd like input situation-

I'm home work going offer friend WFH apartment use day I'm gone, change setting place. works mostly home also construction sites, though requires others wear masks meeting. potentially exposed occasionally, though distancing protocols always place minimize that.

If inside apt several hrs day, risk transmission COVID? Assuming hand sanitizes coming touch many surfaces. know virus mostly spread breath / moisture droplets would stay air many hours? option work balcony stay mostly there. don’t hate ourselves, hate system live in. blind bro? last four years? poser.  CDC lost (RN working pandemic) told us reuse masks (we still are, btw) Imagine disingenuous making many strawman arguments got called trying claim masks make harder breathe. 

If randomly commenting feelings asthma, sure picked one comment chain site would imply masks making breathing harder. 

The comment responded ""I sick argument"" surgeons spend decades wearing mask 8-12 hours shot...to knowledge hasn’t indication “suffocation” amongst population.

Why asthma negate argument? sick it? Nobody downvoting asthma, downvoting response implies masks make harder breathe, least, zero meaning.

The fact believe know you, doctor, medical history, ""reddit downvoting asthma"" crazy. sorry disability victim complex. Well starters grifter king top setting tone rest administration Europe...  would argue Republicans already destroyed Trump. Trump adding nails coffin. eroding trust agencies experts festering encouraged right wing. Hope isn’t actually true matter. Donnie stand front ""MISSION ACCOMPLISHED"" banner NOV 2. It’s good Fauci get Americans prepared hunker down. don’t agree saying look rosy side things however. 

It’s important look positive things there. People social distancing, wearing masks, making safe choices saved lives. people getting overwhelmed negativity damaging mental aspect.

It’s important take one day time, look bright side things hope. It’s good automatically assume several hundred thousand people die Covid it’s flu season, effective Covid vaccine isn’t possible produce distribute, America never recover pandemic. whole second wave conversation interesting. US still first wave cases continue increase. also expect cases spike even November, especially loosen restrictions people tired following distancing safety protocols. always going late 90's me. Everything seems surreal 9/11. Welp   False choice, choice all. propaganda deep religious.  ""any 2 year degree"" sub makes min wage day day. Long term makes ""any 4 year degree"" day day, extra buck two hour long term. 3rd certificate tier. Long term subs put hours like teacher (which manual says they're supposed everything regular teacher does) quickly hit minimum age equivalent hours week planning/grading. Admin said planning time school day that. Teachers laughed thought.

Little wonder sub shortage normal times. Many subs opted in-person assignments even teachers started backing out. doubt locales considering PR could afford sub hazard pay convince otherwise. There’s chance continue things vaccine rolled out, it’s getting ridiculous predictions. statements like make life truly hopeless tbh predictions fall really high numbers, like worse April. understand cases going get hand like that. mean, know, asymptomatic spread exponential growth, people wearing masks things closed less crowded least places. People safer. Office workers working home lot. 

The thing figure we'll problems apartments condos spreading virus HVAC system. could problematic winter people indoors lot heating on. guess. introvert tough. Staying home. Working home. mean, try cope period, honestly know manage cope future. really fear moment covid-19 emergency still continue working home, propaganda seems suggest. work home, watching cinema home, shopping home, getting fit home...
I introvert, bear living cave Oh please. I'm tired attitude  mean adults place convince visit clinic certain autonomy decisions easier handle children literally herded place every day barely say matter? 

When child whole class would taken clinic vaccinations, nurses would come school vaccinate everybody (hundreds children once). Jut logistics aspect makes way easier vaccinate children adults.  think know people aren’t dumb something much attention. It’d better effective 1 time vaccine sell 90% world. Plenty money also come many years becoming standard vaccine newborns. Hospitals generally safe. enforce infection control protocols much strictly places. go ourworldindata look testing numbers. Exactly. death cult. Yeah, well, can't change fact go work, there's nothing change end. think surprised. people find way convince fine caught. Harsh penalties rarely translate great reduction crime. typically better route increase certainty caught. Right people really think go symptoms they'll tracked down.  many. Ah yes, wearing mask slow pandemic ""muh freedumb"" totally equal Jewish. /s Negative attitude dude. chance change things vote. one Hawkeye makes witty remark? trustworthy reports? China try keep Covid secret months started, fabricating numbers while. 6 months. That’s long world lockdowns. factor China starting January, airlines feeling impacts 9 months. add governments world US enacting policies expressly damage airlines. It’s people flying; it’s also governments forbidding it. 

How many months years companies plan government mandated shutdowns businesses? real advantage this, based non-expert level understanding immunology, may provide sterilizing immunity. also may actually know much anything immunology. Lol joke dude  Nothing bad. I've worse shots like Yellow Fever vaccine. think polio measles eliminated? thoughts prayers? 

* [rule 4: avoid rice chessboard example great way get people exponential increase works.

But understanding exponential growth people struggle with. massive figures/powers general. Like people understand big gap million billion are. Unless directly inhale food, plenty contact points mouth throat virus stick infect chew swallow.

Hot food worry me. order salad though. Europe particularly bad: media keep talking ""infections rise"" since weeks weeks deaths seen anymore. goal obviously induce fear: end, 

Well, would hope scare people following guidelines get rid thing, least make manageable. Chronic, acute. Fair enough, I'm mobile can't link source atm. Christ. That’s absolutely insane. don’t personally know anyone specific view, people know won’t let go batshit crazy conspiracy theories seem similar guy. 

All think something missing people’s lives. need *something* makes feel smarter, stronger, like they’re part secret club knows “the truth” rest world blind see. cousin conspiracy theory ready everything. He’s also huge racist, misogynist, wannabe cop. dude’s life suck: friends, can’t hold job, got kicked school bringing knife onto campus. suppose believe you’re still better *somebody*, even rejects every tenet reality, feel better shitty life. people choosing break laws even though know jailed caught extreme example people using free regardless consequences. saying simple pointing graph saying 'those silly doctors, already second wave'. Yes cases increasing.

You mean people. people far get going bars. Everybody know including bar hopping since opened problems. extremely unlucky get it. K buddy, want live basement forever human contact go ahead. would like able fun friends again. Denmark 4 times tests per capita Sweden .  Unless you’ve got money pay rapid testing.. yes, practically useless especially considering outbreaks happening world knew 2020 never coming back. Corona, fires, ice cap slush, prelude even terrible shit future. Interesting. school doesn’t spring registration November. Firstly, matter flu vaccine, years work particularly well (as influenza mutates rapidly) often stop getting infected reduces symptoms. Rhinoviruses also deadly elderly possible them. standards, guilty attempted murder. Maybe think changing standard? I’m fine punishments like America, would unconstitutional cruel unusual punishment clause. 20% figure? data looking at? references whatsoever? LOL ... really ? faced much discrimination Germany speaking Deutsch. 平时大家都不出声，但是人民的眼睛都是雪亮的 generally grocery store 8 hours time. fine €2,000 enough.

Chances ‘quite’ good stock go putting good vibes Monkey business booming. Quite grounded, actually Nothing Baseline health avg Swede baseline health avg American. SARS-CoV-2 much dangerous USA. earth would anyone go movie theatre unless literally dying see certain film? Come now, know someone's situation left mask car. Like users said thread, could taxi/ uber drivers, left could work related. saw two cops wearing masks cop car once. wondered, ""aren't working other?"" thought, ""wait, live wear mask patrol car??"" statement, chose leave mask car ""entertain"" you. all, always better mask not. attitude basically worldwide. can’t believe walk around like nothing happening. Made mistake going grocery store eastern Tennessee yesterday, would never guessed global pandemic happening. Could gotten fast enough. would 100% support implemented U.S. absolutely sympathy anti-maskers idiots refuse social distance especially since hard thing do. Maybe current ""administration"" join well even bigger reasons. I'm bored now. I'll going. may continue posting without me, like. either delusional, child, troll matter sit carriers breathing air? words express stupid is. give next 5 years Here’s recap flu exact thing, whether subreddit accepts not, vast, vast majority cases, effects temporary.

You downplay Covid pointing comparable effects flu. provide research showing effects Covid worse, challenge find research showing flu actual comparable effects. end.

The moment bring research this, start putting words mouth derailing. Turns can’t downplay Covid. Whomp whomp.

Glad spent time show you’re full crap, I’m finished you. Way ignore responding since turning words him. obvious. since cherry pick information care.

Again. claim. told this. refuse stop making things up.

I'm waiting acknowledge wrong screenshot proved know never care evidence facts. I'm going go limb say teachers vaccinated health-care workers. Health care workers well protected PPE protocols. antibody test NYC health care workers lower positivity general population. teachers pretty much thrown wolves. agree schools necessary point teachers full time classrooms dangerous profession America. Mask+gloves handling used filters, put plastic bags, dispose incinerator... makes sense.  think building codes require that, state &amp; local sanitation ordinances certainly could.  Even without required, masks gloves provided maint &amp; tech people, along training &amp; use them.

Too bad make mistakes learn them. Glad OK. What.... farm workers?? don’t understand eating meat helps anyone. person think numbers significant? Like sure 600,000 big number. Texas 29mil people. That's little 2% population... deaths, 15,000 rounding up, thats .005%? Like sure death tragedy, people die due sorts shit. 2017 30 people day died due flu. Idk, I'm anti masker, think COVID Hoax, hate media try scare us. Depends member administration ask, day.  Giving single example work mean anything. Obviously take proper precaution implement appropriate measure everyone get sick. teacher stay side classroom, always wears mask, touch teacher stuff, remain 6 feet, finally follow daily covid symptom checks problem. r/canconfirmiamindian worst idea I've heard entire life. Illinois: *hold breath* isnt science.



I wait first chair engineer. hair stylist came hour early could alone. wore masks. didn’t ask (just requested earliest appointment verified would wear mask), appreciate it. got hell tip. Yes helps know testing enough actually trust numbers.

I wonder positive % back beginning. I’d love see solution would workers went home. easy little rib roast pick grocery store missing action  link do. link supports claim meat producers' trade association would overstate employment *approximately* 6X.

I'm still waiting call [""disgusting insulting  Stupid idiots Using imagination? knew thing? think China honest tropical island sell Antarctica. top (you make 26 hour attending week) places giving extra 500 weekly. good $ China save world, go China We're not.

MUST stop it. takes one selfish fucker. one. problem?Im Toronto 100 cases reported daily average, 30 city millions ( province 14 million). Id seen seating chart went, 30 seats (25% capacity) bought wore masks, used sanitizer careful social distance others way back.

There one family besides family province 14 million 100 cases daily 6-7 rows ahead. basically almost private theater still wore masks. Pretty low risk imo that's comfort level, sounds lot extreme thats ok. 

Our government plan waited long time get stage 3 feel safe see movie listening science. tend agree cocky little reddit user sounds like seen sunlight 6 months.

I living life cautiously see fit. cautious can't hide inside forever. sheltered beat curve live cautiously get vaccine. data doesn’t, opinion doesn’t either. it’s good, nothing say matters. I’m sick argument. wear mask go definitely struggle it’s hot I’m anything would cause breathing get heavier. severe asthma I’m one struggles this. surgeon wears one day doesn’t mean people can’t.

Edit: bunch fools lol. say struggle breathe suddenly I’m wearing mask according you. clearly stated wear mask out. guys love hate anyone something different say never taking account people fucking different. Glad bodies working properly lungs suck. never thought people would talk shit bc asthmatic loll Reddit great. Mine still shows vote ""0"". maybe expand screenshot include comment? see comment posted 2 minutes mine. want see screenshot shows. takes longer 2 minutes calculation described. warned - difficult arithmetic (addition!) involved calculation. mean... know waiting results coronavirus test took? mean big fucking clue???

Or still okay pub crawl flu symptoms? flu also kills people. got Covid test least suspected might be. district also told ""open window"" put box fan (if fit). students in-person two weeks trying least [fund air purifier HEPA filters Many students lost family members COVID-19, teach mostly kids color low-income families tend at-risk virus. nobody talking about, including Fauci, particular strain / mutation dominant. I'm understanding that, initial strains deadly, less infectious. However, dominant strain infectious, less deadly. numbers seem support this. couple thousand less serious / critical cases US peak. 

When whole thing started, thought screwed, like longterm lockdown. think going piss spring next year, without vaccine. works, liberal conspiracy theories already started forming sad. Everyone saw headline Trump vaccine rushed immediately turned vaccines. anti vaxxers, COVID deniers, anti-OWS people country people left willing take vaccine available New instances farms previously occured odd. waiting ""Phase 4"" results? read results Phase 3 apparently time. 

It sounds like would research yourself, regardless, cares Regularity Authority response is. prolific readers clinical data yourself, recommend talking doctor. part country in? I'm much worse allergies too. I'm outside lot. read import cases neighboring countries then. Korea there're 4 imported cases China last 2+ months, considering amount people still entering country that's fuckall cases. could dig deeper reading Reddit post history pain butt Lol thinking guy 同志,暗杀习主席的阴谋进行地很顺利吗?  Yeah BigBlue agree 95%. think masks truly uncomfortable some, it’s certainly pain humid hot day, also take get that. mental toll enough maybe really start asking stuff like “Hey, long hold holding semi-larger events people completely implode.” need find ways work around waiting vaccine. took Uber day first time since covid. imagine lots people driving around w masks also drivers. may forgotten leave entire time cruising. Sure believe I'm Australia. irony guy repeatedly asking things knows exist, someone never claimed did, complaining ""bad faith"" stunning.   China's got covered absolutely loved teaching, best moments. becoming fewer every year. 

Just started 18th year teaching, feel this. So. Much. 

I'd feeling years COVID, ""new normal"" helping all. gonna offer friend saw subbed r/spiders .

🤢🤮 Sounds like something Tennessee They're staying they? important thing look positive % rate tests, actually number people coming back positive. Michigan hanging 3-5%. current 11th lowest rate states. Someone really desperate money. That's really job right that's primary motivator. wish would release names. Numbers mean anything anymore Yeah idk person on. It’s like bumfuck random southern podunk town important movie industry Stay strong Yes. That’s exactly think. Bro, fuck supposed teach science students honest-to-God conspiracy theorists? put mine chin. live apartment requires masks common areas I'm lazy take put back time. Wtf buy ear plugs. Asshole cannot wait hear claim somehow learning harder wearing mask. Vaccines actually usually take lot longer takes lot longer people exposed disease prove efficacy. problem since COVID rampant. 
 Phase 4 (post launch) people tracked longterm adverse events. Fuck that, work 35 hours/week professional career reliable schedule good benefits. judgemental mean life depressing. Unskilled labor kids. think HEPA filters? Thats point, think depression rising. people cant work actually loves places. issues reading comprehension. literally explain yourself. insulting called out. making claim still. claim using non credible, non confirmable data instead reliable government data.

I also say 70k. said 76,000. one making arithmatic issues acting like arrogant individual.

What link asking provide? one made investigative reporter.  Ignore what? Bubonic plague rare treatable, vaccine necessary. TIL talking effects pandemic fetishizing doom gloom. U.S. manipulating data, support China manipulating data they're suggested same?  okay torturing innocent animals never commited single crime? Good luck. likely forced teaching subjects strengths. always make many teachers workplace teach math shortage math teachers. makes sense, lol. genuinely don’t know why, mental image someone getting caught illegally dumping outhouse made immediately retrieve popped head second read OP comment. picturing someone lowered ankles outhouse retrieve trash. 

My brain weird irrational. Wtf guys ? make sure person truly guilty crime first, hard. Same. definitely trust big pharma act integrity. ""pact"" release vaccine know safe pretty much meaningless me. Depends vaccine require two shots effective.  **THE LAW!** Could dangerous pass diseases including covid. also traumatic ppl unused handling dead. no

Edit add: potentially disrespectful families too. Ppl work industry know safely respectfully handle bodies someone's loved one. imagine contemptuous criminal throwing grandmas corpse pit whilst complaining weight? no. Probably American still refuses believe country's colossal failure.

China's government wants get rid COVID, means enforce whichever measures deem necessary.

Chinese, many Asians, put higher value community vs individual. rampant ""no mask mah freedom!"" idiocy exist there. Exactly I've beem saying years, thank you. No, that’s measure impact society, personal risk given vaccine. speaking current HVAC design engineer commercial buildings, ASHRAE codes loosened recommendation 5 CFM person years offices fixed amount per square foot. higher spaces offices low days. Everything save energy yet good keeping virus like this.

Now getting told energy recovery wheels terrible membranes trap virus. Basically measures conserve energy past 20 years undone better protect virus.

In opinion winter months easier summer except maybe northern places. engineers oversize heating begin adequate heating way worse adequate cooling. going burn lot gas. floats boat, cool. I'm 45 year old Gen-X type. Done lot shit. Ammosexuals funny. like watching gerbil trying act tough. Koch (Federal Reserve bank Dallas) Ken Okamura (University Oxford) study China's Covid numbers according Benford's Law, concluded Chinese numbers consistent. abstract.

""Trust reported data contagious diseases real time important policy makers. Media politicians cast doubt Chinese reported data COVID-19 cases. find Chinese confirmed infections match distribution expected Benford’s Law similar seen U.S. Italy thus find evidence manipulation. Policy makers rest world trust Chinese data formulate policy accordingly."" know else too, lot companies loading fleet vehicles cheap could perfect you. Next time hear want pictures adventure! large part.  reputation Obama recovering.  went hell 2016.

But yes, guy like American spreading Coronavirus reason ""ugly American"" believe also long-standing plan involve US military distributing shit fast humanly possible. Using dangerous convincted criminals, pedos serial killers, rapists, murderers, sorta trash. least they'll something good society. Better abusing innocent animal. picturing cleaning outhouses community service crime. Like someone liters side highway think pick trash road day community service. whatever would normally done cleaning trash outhouse do. Putting suit on, getting lowered in, etc. see hard remove. necessarily make suffer anything would normal. Like don’t expect without sanitation suit anything lol Probably adviser Donald Trump They're higher risk virtue work close proximity COVID patients they're essential workers fight COVID. Nearly 1000 healthcare workers died COVID.

And notice children even phase one, whereas elderly underlying health conditions are. Critical thinking fundamental. I'm still curious see ""foundational principals"" sourced from! admit made move on. That's mortality rates diseases calculated... I'm US, 10k seems like insane amount. people want ruin young people's lives make mistake bad? Depends current. DC blasts off, AC shakes you. Pulsating DC worst, grip over. Seen someone get locked onto that, pretty scary. Agreed. everyone like them. I'd apologize bad actors, I'm working hard deal them.

It's clear kind systemic deprogramming education necessary. nefarious 1984 propaganda agenda, fact-based ... evidence based ... review reality. Humans primates. Literally. fear right 

Yet another example north Wisconsin go ""south"" gets It’s also don’t want real immigration reform, workers replaced undocumented immigrants time Yes, countries use measures much smaller countries amazingly China's numbers still better per capita countries. statement still stands question. Ridiculous. tested innocent animals. Yep!

I've traveled quite lot (been 40 countries far). surprised many American bases exist random countries everywhere. American presence pretty common around world. Obviously larger Germany since events WWII. everyone meat packers would job would huge overall impacts. Especially since pandemic would hard people find new work. Potentially tens thousands families would descend poverty. ask meat plant employees wanted stop buying company's product? ok losing jobs, even risks, would quit, make choice feel better options. encouraging people buy meat trying make choice make themselves. Rather punish employees companies' mistakes fighting make change government companies held account forced operate higher levels safety better working conditions. Meat evil, boycotting meat make sense. Corporate culture problem. large corporation would sacrifice employee well name profits rules let it. going boycott products made corporation? answer regulation regulations created government real way make companies operate ehtical moral fashion. Vote! say firsthand encounters WI def careful Wearing mask cause lose business job. people clearly live real world. many 

a handful many. imagine amount BS teachers put high ratio Karens Parents like this. know wear mask I’m there. honestly probably don’t I’m there. doesn’t help E7 us walks around without it. 

I probably correct people like 4x day. 

But it’s like 95° they’re busting ass hot ass shop a/c. really don’t blame removing away people forgetting. don’t sigh throw fits tell them. genuinely act like forgot. I’ll honest, don’t think it’s who’s president, much would cost install enough UV lights school's HVAC kill Covid? going damn hard prove came food horde infected customers staff also restaurant wearing masks caused countless acts recklessness committed every infected person people around them. infection prevalent US tracing source one infection extremely difficult. many cases possible all. 

I'm pretty sure turns vector infection, chef preparing cooked food risky uncooked food food handled/consumed people use bathroom/scratch ass wash hands. Maybe

But someone lives near border goes Sconi devil may care attitude 

Many areas look exactly before. masks whatsoever. Buffets. Hugging strangers drunk bar. nuts. Fans allowed?? What’s reasoning even?

My dentist HEPA filter fans set throughout office — clean air move it. can’t something like that? Whomever making dig symbolic graves utilizing graves corpses? sounds like make work. least Australian cities mostly consistent handling protests. 

Though recall participants arrested BLM protests, organizers got fined. protests held hours hundreds thousands attendance gatherings around country limited 500 fewer. 100% agree. Fauci say something unless he's certain it, good scientist should. repeatedly updated vaccine timeline prediction situation progressed. original prediction end next year, he's come way predicting [end see reason think prediction also quite conservative. That's economics works. like flu vaccine. still get it. Can't speak nation Wisconsin sure Since rest world revolves around EU, US? Korea well, SEA Oceania Problem costs money, happen. private companies government sad. Yes. they’re working.  realize cases declining U.S. going two months now, right? deaths one month (right schedule). Lowest current number hospitalizations COVID since sometime May. importantly, significant ""second wave"" situations. Everwhere new outbreak relatively virgin territory, hit hard almost every highly populated state. left South North Dakotas Iowas world.

Europe gone right past U.S. current global hotspot (outside India course). keep relearning over, can't suppress virus outside authoritarian crackdown, spread timing cases. Party like tomorrow. know people fatigued months. know lot people heart flu exact thing, whether subreddit accepts not, vast, vast majority cases, effects temporary.

Attempting make someone look bad intentionally decontexualizing quote pretty embarassing way ""be done"", I'm glad took time show pompous ass recap oh let’s ask sorry, must confusing you

And PSA learning opportunity “Those rookie numbers!”

 - Trump (probably) used think demographic selfish asshole lot smaller, past 3+ years proven wrong. Dude. literally put Covid patients NURSING HOMES here. 1/3 deaths michigan gov vetoed bill stop it. .. also attaches tail sperm cell, creating small propeller, thus increasing motility.

True story bro. reads garbage anyway. helping u somehow? anything make anti-maskers hate even feel even like there's huge conspiracy play. think desired impact all. Yeah, dude, nobody's saying expecting guy go selfish asshole responsible human overnight; they're *saying* everyone asshole they're never 19 think act like adults.

You're argument everyone clueless, selfish, fuckup 19, case, evidenced *everybody throwing massive party pandemic 19.*  shows far US fallen.

Richest country earth invest anything survival education children. Teachers already get shit pay, pandemic capitol world can't implement proper ventilation safety anyone... real thing there's good reason skeptical lockdowns.

Not cause problems solve.

Yeah, believe heart's desire, evidence short supply.

Ive seen yall's arguments conflating response pandemic omg lockdown ignoring actual death toll virus skepticism, misinformation propaganda.

I happy see wholesale covid denier makes rational many people agree though.

It's like day age creationism denialism.  Good catch! Edited. Came stupid takes. disappoint. American embarrassing now.  embarrassing American overseas Bush. time, much worse President transparently dishonest ugly person.  

People look like ""what fuck wrong Americans"". also starting spout lot nationalist talking points nowhere.

Probably came across conducting internet ""research"" COVID ""just flu."" There's lot overlap subsets population. public holiday Ireland.

^^because ^^we ^^invented ^^it. I’m getting tired getting tired stupid people…  love Swedes smarter virus. Wtf. Lol. outbreaks - yes.

One two infected? - sure.  US Military thousands folks Germany. exempt travel restrictions (but typically quarantine period time arrive, friend got Korea recently military quarantine 14 days upon arrival). Jared Kushner make sure monkeys go friends donors. every classroom attended even windows.

And even open.

I've lived Hawaii, Florida, New York, Virginia, Montana.

Never seen classroom windows open unless like fire window something. Good see America values lives $145 each. bargain, know could afford buy several Americans.

Lived nearly four years dad stationed 90's tell Americans place Germany due military. reading tell everything US, JSTOR subscription extend humanities? like crystal ball tells us future tell future dont listen. He's wrong. intelligence normal distribution, average median same. cracking window ever sold realistic solution? bulk school year winter! 

Even Florida gets cold open windows winter days. oddly similar beginning World War Z... Everyone loses mind case growth high. fact people recovering, like college kids, aren’t dying taking hospital beds it’s really massive problem. random. kinds people eat restaurants different kinds people don't. way make randomly would assign via lottery cannot go restaurants, doubt happen anywhere. Idk man. far see uni Dakota. students compliant school public. Bars parties problem. seen one person flip mask rule. masks everywhere.

Apparently many experienced different. made mistake turning news yesterday watched video Karen mom crying son play football, trained whole life play ball. high schools college football back agenda.... 

Our Governor came Friday announced even highest positive cases per capita state, need move phase 3. schools immediately shut option virtual learning. Even Virtual leaning absolute garbage, still better class room opinion. people never took seriously begin it’s 180k deaths one worst economical situations in. You’re repeating line Biden wins, virus suddenly disappear “go away”. That’s true even given qualifying statements.  school require teachers vaccinated work. sounds like problem retaining teachers, many teachers quit due covid concerns may willing come back access vaccine. Meaning may replacements chose quit instead getting vaccinated.

You need much less vaccines vaccinate teachers children. Pretty sure mistaken. Honestly sounds like mix coming Xanax anxiety getting you. 

If position would schedule test know one way other. it’s negative hopefully mind ease. it’s positive least know begin work mentally Check local authorities' guidance. US, longer retesting positives, telling quarantine 10 days they're free go. Attacking. word media looking Russia openly attacking democracy. 

The GOP simply complicit too, they've taken active role working Russia accomplish goals side. tourist. optical qualities suddenly important vaccine? Damn bruh we're talking sentient, strategic viruses: imagine it'll quite disappointed legally compliant prayer meetings 10 people taking place, rather people breaking rule limiting gatherings 2 meetings dozens hundreds attendance.  Fabulous job they've done. Everyone else country, look learn them! Blah, know tech stuff developed run Indians India, even US comp often outsource stuff India. India makes iPhones export. Shit changes logistical issues considered line science saying

Let's misremember narrative fully attribute blame deserved. logistical issues entirely preventable pandemic response team dismantled early warnings crisis ignored. scientists experts thought deeply planned around logistics pandemic dismissed - that's first error Trump administration. logistics line science, administration listening scientists already planned logistics. [Next, US stockpile N95 masks, releasing whatever whatever unknown Worst part Trump administration, rather seasoned career bureaucrats handling logistics, decided bring inexperienced consultants places like McKinsey figure get masks distribute them, [leading literal billions dollars I'm over-stepping here, saying ""there logistical issues"" similar saying ""mistakes made."" completely avoidable self-sabotage massage one man's ego. many thousands us going die man? We'd like things. Many us mature enough understand wanting something reason enough take risks people's lives.

You fun friends important, excuse act like fool insult people trying beat virus good. I'm sorry attention span developed enough. I’m accepting fact people don’t care unlike don’t take random internet comments personally Federal judge ruled PA shutdown unconstitutional. decision stands, mean shutdowns matter bad situation becomes? Maybe Walgreens hiring plenty studies done oversees demonstrate variety sterilization methods proving still functional afterwards. reusing mask isnt ideal, fine. Hope insanely important, long everything else well. Hope kill virus, country already struggling mental health crisis like idea telling people any. bit crap shoot shape return consciousness, understand people find intubation risky option.

In case, intubated unexpected complications open heart surgery valve replacement. spent 5 days sedation ICU one knew outcome would be, assuming survived. exceedingly fortunate suffer lasting damage, aside paralysed vocal cord. later I've come realize odds favor; me, yes, better dying! Look NYT vaccine tracker. claim make 2 billion doses year. don’t think says 2 billion already made.  C'mon man that's best got? never make debate team that. Stick issue. I'm gonna leave alone now. Sorry mother. reap sow. Probably repeated studies found almost indication outbreaks protests, cases nobody lives there? fuking donation India, donation ensure there's enough vaccine. India one countries capacity produce huge amount doses. already produces lots world's drugs: 

India largest provider generic drugs globally. Indian pharmaceutical sector industry supplies 50 per cent global demand various vaccines, 40 per cent generic demand US 25 per cent medicine UK. Bruh, 675k died Spanish Flu. 618k civil war. 400k WWII.

We even close #s yet, deaths/day decline almost every area.

What makes think we'll 400k dead end year? point state graph suggests graph shows daily deaths.. big spike North East (as expected coronavirus months) early on, second spike South/West (as expected coronavirus). take account US MASSIVE operates like continent 50 countries. 

If assume last daily death count (747) consistent rest year, even though graph shows consistent decline since mid/early August, would 80k additional deaths year putting us 2020 total 270-280k. 

But yes, call idiot. even look data, you? clearly idiot. Clearly. Calling country bullshit responsibility citizen country freedom speech. matter countries to, that's justification. accept bullshit, it'll get worse. preexisting condition called *Outrage Fatigue.* neighbour died covid-19 today cousin got admitted ICU, curious. 主要是出声也拯救不了装聋的人，那也没必要浪费口水了，大家都省心 LOL expect hunker need feed family?

I sure Dr. Fauci would tell he's expecting people quit jobs die starvation go homeless alternative going work. course people still work; however, many, *many* people still insisting gathering together large groups, weddings, partying, etc., *that* stuff people need hunkering get need see grim side things get people wear masks but... point pandemic, many whose mental health taking serious toll predictions helping.

The mental health population primary concern physical health population risk. That's reality dealing pandemics. Dr. Fauci's concern getting people understand real risks virus, make feel better deal it. husband getting tested right now. symptoms weekend. Ugh! Well, read wfh study research, mention depression, burnout isolation collateral damage. study exempted this, fact point necessity increasing professional mental health support employees. thing is: many companies properly it? long run, could consequences taking care negative aspects? stupid magazine articles years said “science” stuff like “coffee bad you” “coffee helps live longer”. People stop listening think scientists morons. honestly telling Spring Break important housing education? one things going first canceled, damn well better Spring Break. lockdown strict think(after first couple months).I mean,It super strict first 3 4 months,after became namesake like everything else ranging masks social distancing.

The problem lockdown proper planning roadmap sort consistency.That said sympathize plight rural people,this article seems nothing justification opening everything right good idea(which horrible idea,because people think ""reopening everything up""==""Corona over"").

Edit:I saying lockdown effect poor,it affect real bad(especially 'migrant worker crisis).And honestly mostly government's fault thinking through.
Here I’ve trying find information outbreaks public schools reopening, I’m finding much data. 

What found, however, lot articles school districts suppressing data. bothers me. Remember lockdowns started happen months back Costco news lot customers vs staff mask issues? employees never fired. Why? one last retail shops Union representation. Actually cant think retail stores still union except them. severe needed complain it. one said completely isolate yourself. Put damn mask see friend whoever mental health suffering. throw giant party something. curiosity, NU students option remote/online classes semester? imagine there's probably kids diabetes asthma rheumatoid conditions would hesitant return lecture halls covid still raging. 2000 EUR fine? 

How raising bioterrorism due lack intelligence giving fuck? Think lot people Reddit sub WANT continue new way living. want live world antisocial behavior accepted, encouraged. gave excuse behavior they’re going cling it. 7.5 billion total humans? test again? even ask us test anymore. Banana Republican shithole country shit. Strange. really let know vaccine group. take antibody test accord? Bad boy... **Looking people share COVID-19 experiences, thoughts, opinions me.**

Rest assured, point change mind would work best Germany. Rather, argument widely accepted idea Western-style democracy *only* good *possible* form government advanced society.

For example, take Germany example reason authoritarian government work: indeed historical cultural aspect it. fashion, anyone argues China *must* democratize (in Western liberal model sense) discarding complex cultural identity, tradition long history.

Edit: Since part US military personal proper trial unlikely anyway. Taiwan model. Get virus control economy. means masks, testing, contact tracing. Sweden didn’t save economy avoiding lockdown.  morons Yeah, can't  Morons shithole state know even masks 100% effective, combine social distancing frequent use desinfectant, help constraining spread. course ignorant people put heir mask wrongly, people refused wear them. arguably harsh punishment crime, need know Indonesian mentality understand that. Laws meant broken, especially there's enforcement.

Source: grew Indonesia. makes think that's possible? Many countries realised ways deal sustained lockdown. Germany, example. maybe lockdown specific areas outbreaks happen, limited amount time.

3/4 hospitalized patients miserable lives able go toilet , even fitness instructors, probably combination residents take seriously, restrictions state, lots tourists. Highways packed Illinois plates summer, mostly ended areas bars open people wear masks. Hopefully disclose original trial design whether reached original primary endpoints announce results. little complicated that. Yes, Applebee's people, people ashamed admit they're broke need get back work, believe pretending problem exist bring customer traffic back.

This get problems like this, continuing push poor people down. least one factors. course many poor liberals, they're usually poor student debt guess. ha, ok. appreciate explanation. good lockdown.  death rates higher first outbreak Northeast totally blind deal disease. Florida basically entirely unaffected that, cases knew deal disease. \[If check graph\] select ""Per 1M people"" ""Full Range,"" see death rate national average since June 25th (2-3x less).

Then top that, fairly populous state. reason people lumped CA AZ/TX/FL July even though never got nearly bad, gets flak than, say, MS really bad.

Side note, excess deaths better metric look COVID deaths, metric Florida 11th highest death rate per capita. NY, NJ, AZ, MA, MD, MS, IL, SC, LA, CO top 10 (plus Washington DC). People really giving Arizona flack. excess death rate 125% absurd given initially affected. (national average 111%, NYC 181%) 10 people meet indoors groups 20 allowed outdoors

If Trump wins, liberal media continue they're now. Biden wins, Trump demand 1000 recounts, spend 2.5 months trying take control dictatorship. may try put new infinite-month calendar never actually hit January 2021 Biden can't take office. vast majority countries Lmao right??  AMA speak doctors. brother doctor says spends almost time dealing insurance companies patients. Supply chains disrupted pandemic, e.g. air traffic. it’s definitely something that’s table otherwise imho see difference race/ethnicity based genocide use legal vehicles enforce drastically needed public health measures? 

You're pretty simple, huh? *then Closing economies worldwide definitely would slave chains pleasant sight see, invisible chains ""work eat"" much elegant. wonder Spring weather influence number infections. isn’t revenge, it’s community service. dig hole think idiot.

.... guess life I've taken granted Western-style democracy universally best form government.

But suppose least one example true. next pandemic. outhouses? guess need go town more. They’re hemorrhaging money due lack elective outpatient procedures; cut something like 20% staff.

It’s almost like can’t functioning economy control pandemic. coulda known?

These “leaders” insane. Get covid control economy back. Stop trying wag dog tail. Thanks recommendation! netflix. Pattinson definitely range. Time stan. Thats confuses this. Theres much conversation many people end asymptomatic, potential spread covid, seems like isnt taken consideration quarantine guidelines. effective local leader cant really make failure national leadership peers.

Look NY, despite badly hit bc trump admin fucked testing preparations, cuomo able lead us back terribly dark days. hampered fuck states same, limited reopen economy lest return health crisis mode. think companies much lawyers. Schlominos care coworker carried knife, team lawyers explained Schlominos altercation they'll get sued berfillion dollars carjackers family ""creating dangerous situation"". one many reasons managed one worst infected countries around globe. expect placebo group option vaxxed EUA issued. need placebo group more. 

Even true, drop study get vaxxed like anyone else. deals drugs relation healthcare? guess shit thought  People always listen Mormons! I’m beginning wonder place get hit hard twice major infection like NY essentially killed vulnerable already July data rerouted CDC HHS. numbers underreported, Trump also took away funding testing it’s limited.  Nah, they're putting families lives danger can't follow basic guidelines bet I'm gonna make call. can't make covid go away work together. curiosity, Florida fully reopened? remember early pandemic Florida completely open fine month, huge spike 10,000 dead last month. Nobody confined Facebook.  boundary speech involves Facebook.

For Facebook opposite. go there. Facebook part speech. Toss people coming California vacation (even though there's literally nothing atm. Please stay state.) could easily get numbers back up. surrounded fellow travelers post live US? do, never flattened curve cases deaths continue increase. top president rerouted numbers CDC White House effort manipulate play numbers. Additionally, testing extremely limited. respectfully disagree speaking experience. creep making casual observation, need wish ill... People capable understanding graphs. think flattening curve means less infections means longer time people getting infected. requires injections sunlight activate. Europe million new cases last month. things open san diego. months. thing closed indoor bars, honestly cares? chance change things vote.

The root comment much better, saying ""you start voting"". Making coarse-grained choice every *n* years seen floor, certainly chance change things. Unlikely Case asymptomatic?

30-50% asymptomatic.. half people won’t even know they’ve got that’s spreads well. shame deadly pandemic robbing meaningful deli encounters Get sub starters I'm disagreeing. I'm saying Federal Judges ones power decide is/isn't Constitutional. judge ruled Constitutional next step either accept ruling appeal. That's I'm saying. Sure, buddy Panic need team experienced enforcers get ground...I nominate Mormons! need real problems Yes Stop weird 39 40 especially nuts. US still first wave cases continue increase

that isnt true. theyve decreasing now.

and America huge. looks like one whole wave, area experienced waves distinct times. percent positive declined months tiny uptick last one two weeks. northeast usa steadily declined across board. Rising percent positive rates exception, rule, temperate regions. 100 fish dang. That's lot fish! 100% believe problems solved solved. fact interpreted comment saying lot show level critical thinking possess.

I work healthcare. multiple degrees different levels healthcare. still know area expertise healthcare isn’t focusing topic better stay lane let figure out. 

Science healthcare always improving, always adapting, always trying new things learning. promise none coming random person Reddit. Done! banned forever. German news sources claim part US military stationed area.

We embarrassment. Everything goes wrong Trump.  almost local state leaders effective either. pub crawl

holy shit lol People want to. Unless get lucky, vaccine 100% effective, people could still get contagious spread around. another tool fight virus like masks distancing guaranteed magical cure lots people seem think be.

You'll maintain guidelines *at least* high enough number population vaccinated. Ayyyyyy Americans making ashamed. great grandparents house. actually told high risk household, kid could distance learning again, ""she would stay whole year want people switching out"".

Because everything going world right apparently that's biggest concern right now.

Her mom told OPTION start remotely, switch back things started settle down, would it... straight told couldn't.

It's fucking ridiculous. Hamsters world, rejoice!  There’s shows reinfection tracking.] 😂 Consumer tastes changing deadly virus going around cause economic downturn own. fact right wing hacks always seem forget.  Dr Fauci initially saying US would pretty back normal summer ***2021***. He’s since walked back bit ***late 2021***.

“Pretty back normal” depend activity. Crowded parties lots drinking shouting without masks — still good idea, especially person 70 higher risk, with, like asthma. 

Those folks would smart keep pandemic guidelines least 70% people mix vaccinated, vaccine good one: closer 70% 50% effective.

But low-risk young people? They’d lot free now, things would open. Outdoor concerts? Probably, games. 🤞🤞🤞 I'm minority, obey law?  symptoms 14 days odds 99.5% it, even unlikely case asymptomatically infected, probably contagious, people true asymptomatic cases infect 0% 1% close contacts according Chinese study, far worried pre-symptomatic infections. ^ (downvotes incoming nobody sub wants hear it) test less find, opposite

Uh, no. test, lower positivity rate (assuming testing prioritize severe cases), course find total cases. brother's father law fired CVS job two decades stopping robbery.  casemedic.. lots cases, little deaths. Different landscape back March. way capable many adults ~~give credit for.~~ Stop looking r/coronavirus find less panicky/insular source information. ineptitudes short comings U.S. healthcare system

which FDA. point. 

The FDA internationally respected regulatory body. Trump might manage fuck up, too, yet. 

As said before, FDA got thalidomide right country's regulatory body NOT, tens thousands people deformed birth result. vaccine stored -70 degrees, that's obviously huge logistical concern though - benefits inhalation great, either, still preserve storage right last second delivery.

What vaccine that? AFAIK Pfitzer vaccine require -70C degrees storage still stored normal refrigeration temperatures (0 5C) 1-2 days administered pleasant temperature. 

The Moderna vaccine stored normal freezer temperatures (-20C) suspect also warm fridge way prepare use.

This article Oxford vaccine. I'm sure storage requirements doubt -70, I'm guessing normal freezer refrigeration days like similar flu vaccines. posted all? think bit extreme.. doctors appointments pretty covid safe. kind life this? post twitter get trending hopefully get person job back get competitor step hire person job part society trying keep everyone safe?  nominate Supreme Court. simple, elegant concept escapes 99% America’s armchair jurists. Yes, exactly like Texas Florida. Hospitalizations later deaths lagging indicators. literally playbook.

June 16th. Young people catching COVID: 14th. Hospitals start reaching capacity: 14th. 7 day moving average deaths reaches peak: customer always right country needs urgently along shift power. it’s even half way effective

I read somewhere 50% effective vaccine means worst case scenario asymptomatic infection. see true lot old people. Besides coming dinner house occasionally (which block away), mother (age 76) barely ever left house pandemic. That’s saying. can’t even use word flu around without accused “just flu” bro. got reprimanded telling customer weren’t serving breakfast since past eleven. said it’s 11:20 told correct. 

Customer got $50 gift cards.

I kept cool whole time would lost mind colleagues situation. Land wise US 20 times larger. strong case well researched, think ban one night stands permanently That's feel. dual US/Aus citizen. rented Americans came Australia even knowing mentality entitlement pissed off. lived USA 1970s people used like that. got new Turf field .
That’s it. 
Georgia. long known people blood type protected severe malaria, types, A, often fall coma die.

Wow. Thanks that. interesting! That's still hypothetical. take heart think means also social distance, avoid large crowds. interesting hypothesis, need see actual data take fact. need everyone vaccine. need enough people vaccine R number, combined whatever else we're doing, goes 1.

If normal circumstances every infect person infects two more, need 50% vaccinated drop 1, cases go down. [This estimates R number UK 1 1.5. infection rate low enough, testing tracing actually work. That’s plan anyway. point, missing much aren’t severely immune compromised, meet little risk. Sit outside garden.. depends. I'm taking solo trip across country, that's one thing. wearing mask car.

As one example another thing, co-worker who's always needing ride. go pick up, I'm driving back work windows down... wearing mask.

Because know he's been, 'a car windows down' sort weird, indoor/outdoor environment. Erm, Brits Sunday picnic abroad, either. wear masks go store. chose wear one, even one. That's good citizen. That's someone MADE comply shitty job it. I've seen LOT lately. flailing, crybaby. WOOSH! “BEIJING, Sept. 13 (Xinhua): new locally-transmitted Covid-19 cases reported Saturday across Chinese mainland, National Health Commission said Sunday. 28th day country local coronavirus cases.” 

This say China still testing hasn’t detected..this saying cases. mean that’s bit creepy right? me? Vaccine testing much stronger 15 years ago many safeguards. Add willing wait 6 months that's talking 100k deaths easily vaccine would kill many actually negative. anti vaxxers worst. American here. traveled Europe several times past decade. see plenty Americans good behavior never fails least per trip see one acting like complete jackass. Totally entitled obnoxious. bad imagine. It’s embarrassing. people travel expecting amenities, food, language, etc...to exactly home? That’s damn point traveling. It’s going can’t handle stay home please. disgrace act way another country. Wisconsin labor day weekend (north dells.) Better amount people masks vs may, though visited 2 rest areas employees working without wearing mask inside. Reported opinion/survey page When's first? lol Movie theaters pandemic? Dieing go. want Netflix became online opinion watch movies pandemic. Interesting electrostatic attraction. I’ll read that. Thanks

I agree virus spreading HVAC units, bigger issue spread within stagnant rooms amongst multiple occupants.

Can’t begin tell many times day explain people risk catching COVID AC minimal. People frightened though. that's irrelevant. tested told quarantine. needed wait day got results. actions selfish entitled. saying grateful virus serious threat is, shown utterly unprepared handle threat all. *what fuck gif* Look/shop around good place.

The guy who's cut hair last 20+ years retired (way early) months ago, he's got 3-4 different risk factors.

I let mine grow long, flowing locks (which irritated tf me, lol).

Finally take more, shopped around good place. Found mobile barber, set appointment. would come place pulling covered, open-air trailer, cut hair way.

The day finally comes around, trailer-pulling truck (of course) shop, decision make: reschedule (for month later), brave (he's got chair set friend's barbershop day)?

I went and, 'safe enough' (locked front door, letting pre-arranged appt, waiting room, wait vehicle chair opens up), clearly family affair 2/3 way haircut older family members came downstairs, unmasked, talking/laughing loudly.

Made wish either rescheduled, worn one KN95 masks (instead merely surgical mask). American prisons cakewalk compared many countries. Let ROT THERE, bill us! Stevie Wonder would seen coming.  confirm. paid $30 watch Friday available. disappointed. But, also grew watching animated version, think I'm biased. started throwing people jail breaking pandemic laws, betting lot fewer people would trying fuck system over. numerous articles coming folks refuse wear masks and/or engage behaviors spread Covid psychopaths, sociopaths narcissists. little doubt good ole Mary fell group. deliberately infected many people could. I’m surprised wasn’t charged murder behavior. Perhaps law expand charge people today show regard fellow humans. people 2 legs, 1 leg, legs. Nobody 3 legs. Therefore average, human less 2 legs.

""regarding belief cases way test billions people""

China detects local cases 28 days, meaning still testing...  Mask companies shambles picture warehouses full unsold stock us, friend works high people Pfizer says thing. bullish prospects vaccine. Symptomatic?? Germany less 1% symptoms positive Corona. 99% things... Australia one state that's locked-down again. Locking second time much harder, looking 5 month lockdown Melbourne.  work elementary school I’ve AMAZED well kids keeping losing recess lunch. Even kindergarteners.

Edit: Really added /s Per article, yes states asked write plans 10/1.... lack funding, staff, technology, detailed guidance, etc execute largest vaccination campaign history.

So got Betty sitting Mississippi county health office, greatest technology fax machine, want perfectly instantly track vaccination 100,000 people, may several shot brands market, everyone needs two shots within 30 days. Oh, give 200k shots county one Walmart one Walgreens. reaction hearing different perspective simply get angry accusatory?

Initially told deaths would MILLIONS now. Sweden supposed 40k dead May alone.

At every stage virus underwhelmed, appears affected lockdown measures we've enacted. committed world view that's fatalist pessimistic? 

It's sad elderly passed away. comparing sick old people passing virus, terrible act terrorism murdered 3000 people cold blood, caused complications tens thousands more, really fair even honest. 

If talking state policy, keep things perspective. country 325 million people, death rate around 3 million annually, end-times situation. even warrant draconian lockdown measures. breakdown shows mainly underway one region (the North West, mild first wave). London South, control.

Someone UK pol sub breakdown yesterday cases comments West England registering cases rate 12.34 per 100,000 people. crowded South East England registering cases rate 1.26 per 100,000.

London South East got hit badly first wave, likely degree herd immunity now. fair, 80-something German in-laws went ballet last week. husband facepalmed found out. haven’t things flu? deadly vaccine well too.

And everyone freaks me, response part particular: “There tolerance spread DEADLY DISEASE”

Why COVID get zero tolerance deadly infections don’t? uncomfortable one masked seated, so...

I went restaurant mother first time since March. mother basically tears begging me. nice day outdoor dining masked went. dumb me. However, restaurant good handling capacity distance patrons. 

All besides point, people sat like virus exist anymore. Masks off. People talking. Sharing food drink. Coughing laughed hard. utterly dumbfounded. table different. Everyone took masks. felt like fucking idiot keeping mask pulling take bite ONE that. 

That first time visiting restaurant COVID here. Take only. non-vaccinated person kills vaccinated person making sick means vaccine piece shit fucking work. Nobody said anything agreeing anti-maskers outhouse trash dumpers. possible people phase 3 trial get exposed coronavirus, even know vaccine defending first place right? .. stopped letting americans access weapons, world would instantly become better place. three things help Hollywood factor going forward:

Freaking death cult. similar schools offices likely around 80% recirculated air. imagine they're similar outside air comes significant energy cost. one difference apartment buildings may smaller individual units per apartment rather single central system. completely depends design intent.

Theoretically airborne aerosol could easily travel duct filter. often actually happens, long takes, whether virus still viable reach 2nd space high enough quantity infect someone debate. 

So definitely possible think there's currently enough info say much risk recirculation actually be. pushing higher levels filtration outside air every space right now. Schools nursing homes focus. fuck talking about? guess kid sleeping biology class two decades ago. parody? true tinfoil hat case?

We know ton people completely asymptotic. know even people symptoms never went test. 

So know testing figure that’s widespread sampling (practically them) quite low. evidence coverup conspiracy.

Yeah lets hear one people actually working vaccine dipshit higher wants boost stock. implement policy consistently?

In terms consistency alone, second, but:

1. state 2 billion people;
2. US, kind policy would set state level, national level. Singapore's population roughly Minnesota's, makes larger 27 US states. **not** small.
3. people know travelling with, sitting with, etc., challenges consistency kinds factors - identifying potential contacts, locating them, willingness cooperate, ease identifying contacts, etc. — basically, combination culture resources. really. vaccine good therapeutics return life near normality. mean people still die covid? course, people dying Covid warrant destruction global economy negatives come that. Yeah same. It’s getting too. Fellow introvert here. Belgium, there's two different ""split three"" levels, plus third level whole country. 
So, virus response would split 3 (or 6!) powers, justice handled 7. 
If *want* fight thing, need support powers bound together agreements. can't build chain weak link, can't strong response X weak one neighbor. That's wasted resources. 

Here, enforcement done local police, deciders held accountable deciders. 
But, like said, assumes politician's carreers danger there's lack response, part voters *punishes* enforcement masks... 

It's assumed central power best placed monitor ""bigger picture"", local one best placed  enforce decisions.

That's biggest issue though, biggest that's quite literally mouthpiece CCP. representative CCP exactly sign truth. totally untrue, rates rate spread. Could COVID, could also pretty much respiratory tract infection.

EDIT: nitwits, COVID *epidemic* UK. endemic levels now. please, downvote ignorance. Right health (mental otherwise) living 335 million doesn’t matter slightest, right? Per million Sweden almost bad US...plus compared Nordic neighbors way  Americans bad let's forget Australian tourists Asia. Lolz  cure stupid. Please pray US.  Dang haha. Gardening aooo finicky it’s super rewarding. I’m jealous tomatoes. Selfish prick. load bunch drugs party home need be, simple. mean that’s I’ve last six months. Clinical trials first piece. Therapeutics continuously monitored even release non-clinical populations. impossible know everything immediately small group individuals representing overall population. that's risk benefit approach comes in. Seems illogical let people die suffer serious side effects covid therapeutic prevent that? Text book move..........trade ""freedom"" ""safety"" see comments actually like idea fuck sake teachers supposed avoid using shared restrooms inadequate ventilation school provides? individualism- collective effort appropriate policies adequate structures place. Reddit didn’t forget anything. I’m partially Singapore dude. Every last person paying cable packages include Fox News pays $2 Fox News via carriage fees every month, even never watch patronize advertisers. $1.9 billion/year.

Its I've cut cable. complicit brainwashing, even means I'm current current shows watercooler. aggressive responds?
It first RNA type vaccine released, anti-vax here, every vaccine history sort side effects, mostly mild safe.
This completely new type vaccine, hope safe people need vaccine, what's wrong that? Absolutely, look logistics giving flu vaccine USA (171 million doses per year, 50% population), capacity argument mammoth sounds.

If vaccine stored -70 degrees, that's obviously huge logistical concern though - benefits inhalation great, either, still preserve storage right last second delivery. Totally disagree there.  Thank you, feels like one district sees hypocrisy, certainly admin parents. Even majority colleagues lying taking abuse. Many even HAPPY returning, least trying come way. makes feel like I’m crazy person okay this. Someone office tested positive management didn’t bother tell anyone except two people sit directly next him, disinfecting whatsoever. nobody else office got (at least symptomatically) likelihood you’re fine. Yes. know. I’m partially Singapore. Brit US, confirm worse group people group british expats. 

I don’t associate them. Almost since day 1 agenda cause division... makes sense. least first phase they’re prioritizing hcw, national security key people. Phase 3 distribution would probably allow small town access.

One many concerns affected (if all,) flu vaccine, they’re going get risk populations phase 2. Old people aren’t typically mobile, even temp isn’t challenge, still seems like there’s significant amount variables consider. suggested doses would limited throughout 2020, widely available next year. also Vitamin dosing dangerous. actually Hormone (which explains body make self sunlight) dosing hormones often problematic long run. “Nobody’s getting sick right?? guess masks aren’t needed anymore! Come brother let’s hug!” I'm critical care practitioner. work. patients sedated ill. frustrating cause selfish behaviour like continued making worse back home states, preventing pregnant bum feel safe going home second trimester Japan still banning tourists so... What's point? think UK immune shit? Flu season nonexistent entire southern hemisphere though, including many countries like South Africa Chile significant covid spread. Chile’s covid deaths per capita comparable US’ South Africa’s likely would older population. flu harder spread commonly spread people showing noticeable symptoms like fever covid. 

An unusual number sick people choosing isolate themselves, closure majority US schools, mask use, temperature checks, social distancing rules stores, cancellation large events (we love talk Sturgis, many events like would normal year?), collectively whole lot flu transmission, even though measures aren’t followed every single person US.  country Tuskegee syphilis experiments imagine people color hesitant trust government truly citizens best interests heart. know it’s local news writer really needs better job giving context stories. unless it’s mandated

That would whole point. vaccines highly effective, fine that's everyone do. minimal effectiveness government mandate continued precautions... 

Possibly US government :(  that’s crazy don’t remember saying children


COVID Attacks Young People

Hospitalized COVID patients (18-34 old) may end up:

21% ICU
10% ventilator
2.7% dead

Risk higher also obese, hypertensive good points. think people start seeing affect people personal life, they'll inclined get one. Honestly, need that. nationality. tbh, I've never seen actually bad American tourists. tend stick speak bit louder dressed certain way, often lot eagles stars stripes clothes, nice polite regardless.


I know people like bash Americans often reasons Americans noticeable Europe disruptive way experience. kinda like Confederates... beaten took gross advantage conciliatory gestures like amnesties build multigenerational resentments eventually corrupt thinking large number American people federal many state governments. Anti-vaccers problem long time, certainly, lots people anti-vaccers case. lost confidence institutions meant keep us safe. one them. definitely pro-vaccine, wont get vaccine feel rushed system political purposes - health line.

I get it, EU approves it. CDC does.

But lets honest. Unless first responder medical profession, vaccine wont available us common folk several months release anyways - approval long granted EU then. coworker knew flu came work anyways ""because work do"" (note: able work home fine done past). 

I ended catching it. fucked up. almost got 105 degree fever go emergency room. $2000 bill (despite super good health insurance). beyond bill, week actual pure misery. 

The comparison use this. Getting flu worse getting punched balls. means would rather office someone 50% chance kicking right balls rather someone spreading flu. 

(Sidenote: ultimately got $2k back expensing things outside policy. instance, instead getting company phone billed regular phone bill company, approved. notice $1200 iPhone became mine, paying part bill. feel ethical obligation honest company fine getting infected.) Yeah, worry, read comment combined face palm nearly knocked earth orbit. always 60 year old professor settled doesnt leave home anyway, pandemic not.

I'm 18, actual fuck think force anyone abide 'new normal decades? Hitler? live SW Ohio gym reopened back May, havent gone back yet. Trying decide feel comfortable going back. Cases rise awhile. Sucks too. Membership started November. Got 4 half months use outta far Oh I’m sorry wife 😢 I’m teacher 3 windows window a/c unit 4th window. best strategy maximize air flow?  keep windows open run a/c? ChYnA!!! hOpE dIE!!! good guys.

Also reddit: ""wE hATe gOBormEnt!"" Wow, really getting downvoted people really mad masks paid sick leave? Woofda. Ok. good reason sill wear mask except inconvenience? continue this? helps could least much. Wearing masks surely killing economy else Asia would permanent depression. country truly hideous right now.

Looking outside? quite while.

Why rest first world nations provide universal health care, USA can't? 

German universities tuition free, pre-corona balanced budget almost 10 years, lowest unemployment rate decades lowest crime rate decades, Germany still supporting 600 thousand refugees. Easily.

America rip trade treaties effect decades, working, I'm talking trade treaty Canada. best neighbors never deserved.

Americans need get heads screwed straight, start voting. already did. isn’t rest world back 100% normal? Real talk. single family? stuck 1br wife week long blizzard stressful. Can't imagine 6 months quarantine without separate room decompress. resident Tennessee (Memphis), I'm sorry, America. We're ignorant. jails? laws restrict people’s free means literally cannot break law. Therefore jails must empty, since breaking law impossible.

If jails people them, means laws hinder free since people clearly broke them, thus exercising free will. older relatives care ? children might get heart damage months mild symptoms. neither apply lonely person. forget /s?   Wow, leaps 'logic' like Olympic Gold medal contender. 

And I'm sorry trying teach something new, (here's little clue you) there's need 'mark' anti-maskers way seeing clearly, openly show everyone else WEARING GOD DAMN MASK!! own!!! JFC.

&amp;#x200B;

Watching idiotic anti-maskers trying hardest equate community service sentence either/both holocaust/slavery fucking disgusting. Seriously disgusting. horrible way purposefully misconstrue everything article. \*smh\* I’m much extrovert enjoy removed society. introvert partner much difficult time restrictions... it’s interesting development us truly. would write it? news:

Coronavirus: 14% doctors England struggle read basic bar graph paint broad strokes taken seriuosly. Go learn facts pretend know them. think assumption ""failed"" wrong. America ok little while, especially early summer. better question would probably went wrong then? good question find answer to, seems going wrong Europe too. America probably first screw waste whatever gains they'd made. 1918 influenza, 2-3 day incubation period, median generation time 3.3 days, 2 week lockdown enough cause cases newly infected within households resolve either recovery death.

Alas, Covid19 incubation period 14 days, viral RNA shedding extends weeks. three week lockdown, even effective enforced, nearly long enough wipe community spread. countries effective lockdowns like China Italy roughly 10 week lockdowns.

I think may universal problem: democratic leader political capital order multiple sufficiently severe lockdowns. first one effective enough, time used hire train testing, contact tracing, quarantine personnel prevent clusters. that, fatigue sets political repeat. US wasted opportunity effective lockdown March April, we'll live prolonged limbo either distribution effective vaccine herd immunity... might mean will. People aren’t going mask distance vaccine. People already getting tired slipping. 

Honestly vaccine doesn’t mean back normal what’s point? thats real tinfoil hat.
Alrighty guess

Let`s sum up:

Cant ""not torture animals"" profit because:

1. Farmers would make less money.
2. Forces farmers sell farms noone else China taking America

If dont see crazy cant help you. thought process involved pure comedy. Well agree response let's clear selfish jack asses like people wearing masks now. like Japan people looked angry wearing mask even though coughing. thought mean reality was. respect want get sick. reason Asian countries less problems dealing this.

I'm looking forward us understanding wearing mask really much big deal staying home feel sick considered colleagues. think cause panic - act asking question likely trigger response (as in, even asking me, must dangerous!) - people refuse vaccine virus kind chugs along, maybe infecting many people was, but:

1. vaccinated, might among group work whatever reason;
2. There'll many vulnerable people end social distancing altogether. people vaccinated, quicker (and further) R number drops 1, quicker Covid goes away (even entirely). vaccination means social distancing effective (and therefore, less social distancing needed) half population immune, half still infected R rate sustained 1.

Hopefully people perceive risk differently know people vaccinated, rather simply favor it. comment makes feel old. yeah, Millennials get reputation lazy cheap entered workforce nation mass layoffs. Yes, we're killing construction industry can't afford 2-3 bedroom house we're 37. Yes, we're killing jewellery industry gaudy displays wealth first thing cut trying balance budget. Somehow also killing grocery restaurant industries guess eat less, gym weight loss industries probably also going take hit. GenZ screwed, bet news still call Millennials. NY locked earlier, would saved lot lives. 

Places like San Francisco lock bit earlier generally done pretty well. greedy sociopath I’m bummed made far got covid, mistake like you’re saying close tackling this. None said makes removing restrictions good idea.  I'm referring customers employees. local grocery store, 1 10 employees leaves nose out, mouth nose uncovered. Getting vaccine mean things go back ""normal."" saying laws violate free will. That’s point law! restrict people’s available choices. saying good bad. logical inconsistency. said many times thread saying anymore. world mean think laws shouldn’t exist?

I don’t know else explain let someone else life show one day. want lives inconvenienced. want feel guilty caring. believe science. think 6 feet apart helpful can't many people indoors. squish people elbow elbow larger chance someone spread it. 6 feet safe makes people comfortable saying cap establishment 10 people 50 percent less chance 20 people inside. Besides feeling achey anyone else’s skin get super sensitive too? Like feel shirt rubbing skin it’s sort uncomfortable. Rate less 5% One Trump's methods appear like he's always got everything control. can't admit know something, entire house cards would fall. think tragic anybody dies. Nobody ""deserves"" die.

Do think people obese killing themselves? Yes. much so. also kill people making health care expensive slow everyone else.

Bill Maher spot (Being obese personal decision 100% someone living Portland, currently blanketed wildfire smoke, last sentence bit depressing. Yeah it’s interesting differences areas.  places dip testing direct result viral spread abatement.  point people take less tests simply less people reason so. took test month ago med express bad sore throat. parking lot lot people getting tests.  drive every day work parking lot area people wait Covid tests empty. CDC currently using estimate IFR (infection fatality ratio) 0.5% aged 50-69. mother may higher risk due smoking history...but estimated odds survival someone age group get infected high (99%+). mean it'd pretty without complications, 1 500....but think important understand asking ""does mom stand chance fight off?"" answer overwhelming yes.

That said- that's still unusually high risk death taking steps minimize risk exposure (mask wearing, limiting unnecessary socialization, avoiding indoor gatherings etc.). think locked bubble either. determine reasonable middle feel bad smart people live uneducated areas. proved point provincial attitude.  Late 2021 entire world defeated COVID vaccines US half million dead still quarantined rest world. pure ignorance. No, charged infecting someone HIV.  it’s longer Cytokine Storms Bradykinin Storms Covid kills. lay person idea means. Maybe figure new treatment reduces death rate zero? 5 people 60, offer help distance learning? owns house? 

And clearest kiddo brings covid19 home, parents kid take best. like it, criminals...my vote pedophiles next. odds somebody walking table mask outside infects essentially zero. You’re paranoid, fault media. lack reading comprehension appalling. seem purposefully misunderstanding what's going on.  


So, I'm going assume idiotic, anti-masking moron trying best misdirect pay community service sentence crime.  


Begone idiot troll, need willful stupidity ignorance here. Hmm ... let's take look ol Worldometers dashboard, shall we? Yup, sure enough, cases going two months (odd outlets like Vox noticed, that's another story). What's going on? Well, Southern states seem hit plateaus declines roughly time. Big states, small states. States competent governors, states ... ahem ... without that. States lots varying laws regarding open closed businesses, mask mandates.

But wait, common? Yup, hit (within margin error) case density, somewhere 2% 3% population known cases, means 20% actual total cases, likely.

Again. Hmm ... depends... France (need declare going outside dog), Belgium Netherlands style. 
But positive effect, fail US? Lack enforcement? still difference accidentally passing disease street, vs holding illegal party, knowing full well endangering lives. 

My principle people *deliberately* risk passing Coronavirus (e.g. Anti-maskers, anti-vaxxers, lockdown breachers) guilty attempted murder. 

I know I've never flu get vaccine every year. it, praise country owes WHOLE WORLD. Respect science ass. hid truth mattered most. took research couldn’t used. suicided scientists whistle blowers. China owes world retribution!!!!! see going tried tested trick, tell lie enough times becomes true. government order supersedes orders order keep meat packing plants open. Thereby making guidelines ensure safety workers precautions used mitigate spread covid19 secondary remaining operational. removed liability corporations ensuring safety workers virus due fact would hinder order remain fully operational maximum capacity. don’t know you’re arguing hasn’t effect removing liability know already fact order immediately effect removing liability. courts threw liability case moving order signed. interpretation doesn’t change courts interpreted as. None actually ""cures""- prevent diseases.

For mumps, follow hockey, actually know mumps outbreaks NHL had, including infamous Crosby ""I mumps"" interview. Fun fact: 2 players got 2nd time vaccinated unlucky.

My aunt got polio 50s. vaccinations started, able get one. period vaccinations start crucial keeping social distancing herd immunity. aunt victim idea could go back normal. survived, dealt post-polio syndrome entire life. recently, caused severe complications due covid. mom never showed outward signs polio child, exact heart disorder aunt, leading suspicion may actually post polio syndrome. actually asymptomatic still get post polio, chances get aunt honestly slim none. people chime in, ""LOL, IHME,"" YYG happening one day Pfizer vaccine comes it’s possible I’m trying optimistic. We're divided 24 year old punk beating old man simply trying get sick. country truly hideous right now.

I'm glad added kidnapping charge. Hopefully aggravates longer sentence. Yeah we're *only* 35,000 new cases per day! We're *great*! gave party dumbass... responsible everything happens cause make sure everyone following rules.

Also mention LAW?

If bar make masks mandatory bar become epicenter line infects responsability bar. Like things work, things change cause find ""government bad cause make party middle pandemic""

""boo hoo government fined cause broke law party middle pandemic virus highly contagious killing hundred thousands people infecting millions them, really hate government takes money away 19 yo guy perfectly conscious consequences""

I sure guy organized party fined random guest would defended saying ""its fault guy organized party, justice here?""

Everybody involved situation pay, legally fucking organizer responsible pays... fucking care goes bankrupt fine cause deserves much worse.

People die virus thought ""oh let's party even law, way take deadly virus ah ah God I'm genius"" lockdowns would lasted 3-4 weeks though. would 100% back normal May 1st.  Cause uk great job handling virus? Election Lives 

\- Someone named senior parents situation , know perfectly deal that, however reduced family visits minimum, prevent catching virus. tell something already doing. ""China even went far kick international journalist pandemic its' peek""

Doesn't matter many times say, still true. hate say bro.. (Pakistan, India Bangladesh) stupid people country stupid people power. getting less cases means guys testing enough people. thing guys uniquely done france, UK US.
You guys opened mosques june. Pakistan 153th rank test/million. Pakistan isnt even testing 30k people day. hope everything works guys. looks like government living denial.  Oh, one *those.* Got it. countries use form court ordered community service penalty. see reason service digging graves couple hours offender able-bodied. chance “forest bathing” Japanese call it? woods hours would help. 

I one local friend bubble. losing (depressed/ discouraged) last week called went scenic drive (masked, windows down). Huge help. Different situation though, right? person fired defending themselves. fired bringing weapon work enforcing mask policy.

So crazy latter would used justification firing someone. disagree need especially cautious winter, basically fear mongering now. Comments like help, give people reason double denial. Additionally case above, check cases literally 1 minute google news.

&amp;#x200B;

But, everything OK here, sure!!!!!!  see people wearing masks time time mostly due pollution stuff culture kind existed degree pay video date betacuck would fine pulling either defend honest. right defend yourself. No.

Yes, called legal precedent. Maybe look up.

Stop pretending BS lawyer internet dude. one impressed, Keith trust corporate legal redditor used google

Says Redditor using anecdotal evidence. No, that’s violation company policy. legal right self defense, violation employment agreement carrying weapon work. 

Please reddit, smart enough distinguish 2 things Hello guy Europe, please explain Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden mask usage 10%. 4 days sniffles/runny nose faint sore throat think I’m boat I’m confident it’s cold true. Vaccine first go hospital staff, children public school, essential works, everyone else. order. Framing persons carelessness wanton disrespect fellow citizens government overreach hilarious. Thanks laugh almost million people dead, countless permanent lung, heart, brain damage. wake up, shut up, stay fuck home keeps coming...and coming...

I think second wave Fall season gonna worse precautions taking, precautions ignoring summer.... Please give anything like that. Yeah, Rite Aid garbage company. stopped giving business learned using facial recognition software stores. care financial safety? simply way hope operate business reliability every 4 months country shuts “stop outbreak” right! Thank goodness Newsom putting needs aside greater good state. Yes happens time. Check local news. several cases. get reported nationwide think.

So, evidence. Try reminding hostile mob wear masks, go nicely I'm sure. enough areas want country. linked equivalent fake Facebook news

And yet link literally anything outside strong unproven opinions.

[28 28 studied super-spreader events Every piece researchable data shows outdoors events high mask usage relatively safe compared even single bar open. 

I'm done wasting time throwing real data magically finding problem everything providing zero data yourself. Enjoy uninformed personal opinion. Vladimir, America much, much better together Balkanized.

Don't take word it. Here's author Constitution, James Madison, say [Federalist America united, handful troops, without single soldier, exhibits forbidding posture foreign ambition America disunited, hundred thousand veterans ready combat. Nah. Republican thing change policies actually anything Production already started multiple vaccines thanks governments funding production process. vaccine producers working financial risk production side. Basically, can't lose money mass produce vaccine ends ineffective dangerous trials. New Normal gonna keep away mall restarants theaters, etc. Ill tell much future. Science. paper makes specific claims nature virus proposes procedure could resulted lab-grown origin. Argue those. Go outside live life realize it’s serious day job. sounds condescending, especially considering never said anything hope US requiring additional investigation- aka, likely want formalized one AstraZeneca saying ""all clear"".

This shocking actually pretty normal, US historically pretty strict drug approvals. mostly clearing red tape. That's honestly part reason trial arm also taking place US- ease US approval involving US regulators trials. consider 40m unemployed 200k dead bleak. You, sociopath, not. Maybe get therapy yourself... young child goes doctor, gets pumped massive shot many vaccines, doesn’t feel good changes – AUTISM. Many cases!” Much, maybe most, party policy essentially Catch-22. possible base trouble comparing two conflicting thoughts. conversations I've recently, like forget conversation sentence pick word recent one pivot of. Omg really happen? don’t know what’s real anymore ridiculous things are.... Hello, guy Europe here. Mask mandates helped SHIT TON first wave, second wave countries (mainly France spain) much mask, people getting lazy following rules. 
Masks work. wear them. America getting slaughtered moment daring reopen? Good point Khiraji  Sorry hysteria encouraged individuals defy virus restrictions. Incomplete thought. use shirt man, hell?  Video video. News story news story. 

If want pretend happen, that's foolish. think juries see difference using knife weapon using wine opener, especially someone explicitly carrying knife self-protection?

If person says carry another purpose show use job opening boxes, example, guess case.  No. case getting physical altercation, OP. nothing zero tolerance weapons policies. 

She fired physical altercation, fired violating weapons policy

The facts 2 cases completely different. r/confidentlyincorrect

And know I’m talking personally employee pulled taser work fired tried fight it. lost.

So yeah, state laws vary may exceptions, violated company policy subject termination. trust corporate legal redditor used google That's false.

The death rates low 40.

But possibility long term damage COVID higher. epithelial disease easily impact organs quicker influenza. 

I'm going wager go age group age group, every group young adults see higher CFR C19 flu. numbers hand back assumption.

Edit: Definitely 40s+ significant difference CFR gets larger larger. got severe sore throat immediately got tested.  negative.  Sore throat symptom lasted two days.  problem considering previous article im sure wanna take it, now. Honestly, care get coronavirus..I wear mask respect others. yet state can’t re-open even second level restrictions. Newsom set impossible standard reopening specifically said doesn’t care death hospital numbers cares cases.

The cases New York Times called extreme question report 90% positive cases likely negative. used see airports infrequently don’t care. got money already. schools care about. doubt get help. Also, therapy never helpful me. normally makes feel worse. AirBNB northern Wisconsin, confirm saying true. Too, Summer 2021 completely booked couple months ago. expect pull billions doses ass?

Let’s say 7 billion people get this. factory produces million doses day, would take 20 years produce enough doses 

You need lot factories running around clock world produce much quantity. Modern technology given people false sense instant gratification enjoying it. friend went vacation Mexico living fucking life right now. I’m close saying fuck it. fair, things change never go back pre-9/11 normal US. many people thought they'd taking shoes get airplane 90s? think mostly go back pre-COVID normal, things change permanently. Hopefully positive ways. promotion based whose ass kiss self-promotion? talking nature Ralph Baric directly contradicted paper recent interview. Cortes Pisaro joined chat.  Well, Denmark requires masks public transport. obviously stuck national level remotely well should've? close 200k fucking dead so. keep twisting logic thinking clever Nice troll are, ask others something tell ""already"" do. 10% lung damage, less liver, brain, heart, fatigue, around 5% believe, one good article tell me, sounds ok you? main goal keep everyone safe, outbreak safe environment. think there's kind campaign trying paint Fauci negative light discredit him. find hard believe many people think doom gloom-er, that's probably downvoted. 

It's pretty clear what's happening. Hopefully get tired move something else. Yeah one premier modeling guys (Gu maybe? sp) said article believes daily cases almost 450k/daily back June/July. true, staggering

Edit: - MIT “armchair epidemiologist” read alot every day believe what’s going Europe predictable result loosening previous restrictions + vacas + travel expected cases would rise, even skyrocket. 

And three weeks cases skyrocket get deaths — Far fewer spring though, testing back didn’t accurately reflect actual case volume, elders better protected now, largest cohort getting Covid 20-49, far fewer hospitalized. 

As soon stricter measures you’ve begun effect (that happens surprisingly fast US, like within weeks), cases go right back again. 

No worries. Encourage masks, social distancing, avoiding crowds. It’ll get better. 🍀 like timeline. Make stop. tell many people Whose lying? sentiment stated ""things look bleak"". sentiment healthy really accurate. several feasible ways indeed within reach. look bleak me. 

Were things bleak? Definitely. 

Do look bleak now? No. talking stages damage control especially vaccine close. think cope you, fixating grief helping. get away, possible would attacked further. two unarmed people, unlikely anyone would severely injured killed. gotten knife fight, could gotten killed. restarted Britain Saturday. would say let’s give FDA bit time review start yelling politics it. 

I work clinical research deal FDA regularly. tell don’t care health agencies say. standards. study conducted economists. I'm saying huge conspiracy linked article says protests slowed spread. moronic. Link infectious disease experts people researching epidemiology pandemic say protests slowed spread? linked equivalent fake Facebook news irony many defenders knife would employee pulled gun. politics hand. sub people taking shit others? belongs there. believe purely malicious? look like it. seems insincere, especially click profile. numbers context place. key difference aware injustices happening country  Cause one proven yet Nah fuck anti maskers. They're forcing extra labor doctors nurses, go ways.  piss? 

What? cant take vaccine gonna help me, man...This better bullshit Presumably policy prohibits bringing knife excludes authorized equipment provided store used manner proscribed. Policies like nothing new, language tested prior cases revised inadequate. course, never say jury do... hope not. Maybe journalist someone recovered they're precautions wearing mask, social distancing,etc.... point though. us are. guy played Richard hillman Corrie used get death threats damn smart bot shouldn’t anyway, there’s rarely enough people willing inconvenience much make difference.

Much like masks days. Yeah. Mitch thinking, ""as be"" reads this. Yeah, idk. I’ve locked kids 6 months I’m it. Didn’t go stores, online school only, haven’t seen hugged friends let kids play dates. supposed to. it’s gonna happen 6 months never will. it. Winnie Pooh thinks he's good?



Hmm.. must unintelligent thought. criteria place virus free. And

I never spoke prison sweatshops US suddenly far: Sequel

^^Coming ^^soon ^^on ^^VHS Wait, really? flu 1918, flu 1957 Swine flu 2009? Sigh. needs end. Good luck us all. hell quote course mean works, means know works"" risk management cost v benefit. calculus much different considering benefit school versus benefit partying. fair Mormons also try convert Christians Mormonism. saying is, West using masks every flu outbreak like Asia does. agree. social distancing flu season give everyone paid sick leave, even they're new hire. people choose infecting people going hungry, expect show work coughing sneezing. Fuck love Yeah, do. We're small spot, five them, four I've worked 4-10 years. People fairly generous overall terms tipping, best earning year, they're getting along pretty well. go fall weather becomes less conducive business model, I'll probably supplement income more. I've got money EIDL loan socked away case unemployment shits bed float everyone winter, hopefully come that. super-inhibitors virus stops dead encounters them.

It's like either cause infected person recover prevent passing someone else, they're hardly inhibitors: every recovered super-spreader reduce transmission rate future, likely people contacts, right kind (i.e., prolonged contact infected vulnerable people), still jobs habits six months later.

I agree general thrust saying, I'd say holds true blocking opportunities super-spreaders super-spreaders need (among essential workers) still individuals start pandemic. everyone else doesn’t lock forever, still bigger risk. isn’t fair then. shouldn’t risk dying party. tool, 8.8k deaths among pop. 267M you’re making people forced labor??

2 years ago people worked sick? welcome 2020 guess

hahahahaa we’re together yea fuckin’ right :P believe statistics coming corrupt, lying murdering Chinese regime? Note eve major religious holiday season. lockdown basically covers holidays only. 

It's pretty big deal. husband's father military recruiter, told kids he'd disown enlisted. knew really like.

I'll bet principal dead fucking serious. also think people care anymore. governments messages unclear. track trace, daily meetings, 19000 U turns obviously Cummings fiasco. messaging needs drastically improved every lockdown rule ignored. live Manchester honestly would never know local lockdown. YES, yes, right, SMALL CLOTH MASK (worn properly) HELP. 


Nice see finally understand this, keep good work. Yeah, that’s good point.

Do ways estimating Flu IFR? Would reasonable say every 1 confirmed case flu, 9 go uncounted? (1 10000 Flu fatality rate) weird projection? People downplaying amount deaths covid ones saying flu killed people 3 months ago...like bruh, guys arent even trying anymore 😂 throw shit wall see sticks. Covid death worse flu death?

It isn't, covid19 10 times lethal flu. 10 covid19 deaths worse 1 flu Covid zero tolerance

Exponential infection rate high R0 factor. 1 flu death week possibly means 1 flu death next week. 1 every week. covid19, 1 week 4 next week, 1,000 5 weeks, 1-million 10 weeks. there's nothing do. Decision schools determined based local circumstances, in-line national guidance criteria / standards. Schools functioning lots places, hard work getting virus levels low enough. 

imho easy fall trap thinking measures binary sense. lots places look see successfully managing it, US uniquely completely devoid responsible management national level...

We need bring virus check. need plan get lives knowing virus around. need deliberate &amp; responsible balance those... US utterly failing that. investigated ""physical injury resulting negligence"", carries fine prison sentence three years. likely she'll get fine, maybe suspended sentence. Even lot people distancing wearing masks won’t years, they’re “until vaccine comes out”.

If vaccine doesn’t work and/or takes years produce majority people say “fuck it” let herd immunity it’s thing. Since vitamin deficiency may increased many factors could associated COVID-19 risk, including age, obesity, diabetes, chronic illness generally, observed associations vitamin outcomes almost observational study may fail accurately reflect potential causal effects vitamin outcomes. Nevertheless, analysis controls many factors, idea adequate vitamin levels could prevent COVID-19 supported meta-analysis randomized clinical trials Martineau et found vitamin treatment persons vitamin deficiency reduce viral respiratory infections, among coronaviruses common causative organisms. 

This, combined Spanish paper supplemental vitamin hospitalized patients, suggests vitamin important enough proactive maintaining healthy levels.

Extreme consumption vitamin cause hypercalcemia, go nuts though. Dietary adjustments occasional supplements make sense; overkill harmful. world US? talking US. put fly list airline. I’m embarrassed Tennessee. depression I’ve fallen pandemic multifaceted. I’m deeply saddened loss many lives people hurting due physical loss economic loss. I’m also depressed slapped face realization surrounded selfish idiots live, turns even relatives dumber ever imagined. resorting attacking me? 

I laws, told several times already! 100% agree every law every country? do, hope never deal something disagree with, may hard time figuring do. Another aspect Trump administration going fuck royally. Even half Americans want vaccine, that's 150 million doses. 

An average Flu vaccine can't given 10 million people given year would imagine. that's course several months. 

100 million people want vaccine soon proven work. way Trump-led country that. 

Even Trump loses, still president January. Ugh. fucked. Yea compressors running months straight. odds? 0,02% chance actually die Covid. take vaccine masks distancing. Every year influenza kills 250,000 500,000 0.1% CFR flu, IFR. None commonly used estimates flu mortality take account asymptomatic cases (which make majority flu infections). glycol loops buildings 100% outside air intake recovery systems. geothermal wells too. Also chiller water systems units exposed roofs. hot water systems straight water freeze stats throw valves wide open shut fans air sensed cold coming in. Good luck one, charged know HIV purposively try spread it. Given large number cases asymptomatic zero chance ever punishing someone virus may even know have.

That's one things poor countries could - tell people really get lot that.  talk neighbours, arsehole unless refuse listen sub loves chaos. people loudest want us fear forever. risk averse. you’re right goal get COVID-19 acceptable risk - **right isn’t**. vaccine drop expected IFR 0.7 % right (I think) 0.3% - able quantify risk 3X severe seasonal flu. think people would return normal (no masks, distance) 3X severe flu.

Slavery actually acceptable punishment crimes America Britain Spain several countries. people getting us one time lesson hard work would pay fines forget. trying lay guilt people now? think charge people manslaughter pass flu someone dies too?

If people comfortable mask free environment even vaccine widely rolled out, free stay home. rest us would like go back normal, especially us risk always tiny anyway. understand mean prematurely, premature open businesses. shut forever, wont able open everyone vaccinated? right. For-profit medical research creates kinds incentives cut corners, ignore problems. Hell, for-profit medical research creates incentives CREATE diseases, hype-up existing ones. bad. terrifying. all, virologist advising heird immunity kids teenagers expect vaccin march next year.

Do sources ? Still need glass vials syringes, currently short supply. is, ok risk ruining other's lives gathering. hope sends message others looking throw party causing trouble warnings. Yeah deaths spring peoples biggest concern crowding supermarkets chase toilet paper. 

Right Sweden great makes sense start forcing behavioral changes. 

I hope god introduce masks here. think effect, people immediately move whole discussion masks masks rather overall picture. Social distancing works, masks may added effect, one warrants controlling whole discussion. Completely agree. Question really whether organization going invest something would redundant 3-4 years. think governments would need get involved. South East got hit badly first wave, likely degree herd immunity now.

""Some degree herd immunity"" - dispute that. that's broad statement.

If means: people seen first hand bad first wave looks like, naturally cautious, distancing result, likely exposed already ill kind immunity, reducing rate transmission extent: yes, agree.

If means: Covid would longer threat stopped distancing, etc. - nope, all. I’ve noticing lot grounded compressors this.

Just don’t cooling capacity you’re bringing 100% 90F air maybe 70% RH 24/7 ~~thoughts~~And prayers kinds death doesn’t mean shouldn’t eradicate one. Uh...what exactly projecting Mr.Lockdown Doomsday?

Edit: record. Downplaying severity infection resulted unnecessary deaths hundreds thousands countrymen terrorism. remember story posted month ago waiting staff? so, paying them/affording pay them?

Not trying rude, curious could work economically. figured wait-staff US either face-to-face customers mostly earning money. 

Are waiter hourly earnings going less people eating? fewer waiters? Would class action lawsuit unfortunate, too? Oh, make mistake, reputation circling drain, nation people. However, mean Americans individuals would treated poorly. nothing fear, people might feel need tell *really* think you, uncertain terms, particularly alcohol involved. So, yeah... unpleasant exchanges *super* unlikely occur, us absolutely get Americans stand-ins America, treated much polite friendliness anybody. 

Edit: Hell, freaked nation's current state us are, might make fast friends majority Germans. :) Society functioned pretty well covid came along, plenty viruses loose then. think mitigating factor (vaccine) makes covid less shit show enough get us back normal tbh administration taken response sub wanted it’d filled articles lockdowns killing small businesses benefit Bezos killing mental health.  I’m guessing you’re doctor since know much me. case, maybe stop talking medical history internet doc.

Also, didn’t say anything post downvoted. know anytime post Reddit popular opinion professionals downvoted. I’m ok that. technically authoritarian government function correctly would always work better good democracy

Why would it? Sure, would work better authorian leader friends - rest? much depends defnition what's 'better' isn't. 

In regards Covid, democracy could work efficient authorian regime theory. people leaders decide actually want severe level restriction freedom massive invasion privacy. decide accept deaths exchange values important society. make one solution worse though, different.

The perfect government exist next best solution get good democracy implement many safeguards possible prevent becoming worse authoritarian. That's countries want go total surveillance solution Covid, may even unconstitutional.  

The US good example democracy anyway seems like rich businesses important anything else. results regarding Covid expected. China hand may gotten Covid control - level 'efficiency' trying get Uyghurs dissidents control. Honestly can't say worse. original comment. one that's downvoted stupidest thing I've ever read. 

Do actually know slavery is? it. ""literally"" practicing slaves. They're literally people service community retribution crime. Slavery would indefinite servitude innocent person. they'd take vaccine even legally required handed free iPhone. Well watch bbc news think one next 2 months already increase cases last days legal opinion someone know word precedent. Hilarious. Americans, whenever allowed travel country again

Americans banned travelling Germany anymore Ok epic. hope people North America else get punishment think ever go back way was. think wear masks look healthcare forever. think flu season see lots mask usage.  lazy idiots cant bothered read article, lives works No, want know came conclusion Covid zero tolerance causes death shouldn’t Yeah, realize last comment lol. meantime thousands die. Would happy waiting another 6 months meant another 200k died instance? 8 confirmed cases reinfected among 20 million people recovered covid probably means confirmed cases relatively isolated incidents. Thanks putting time write like punishment.

The main advantage Singapore logistically implement one set rules everybody enforced consistently thoroughly. try take public transport without mask, bus let on. try enter shopping mall without mask, turn away. try buy drink 7–11, refuse serve you. police officer sees public without mask, fine you. try enter anywhere like shopping mall restaurant, check QR code temperature taken.

What moral difference picking trash road work (classic forms community service) digging hole manicured lawn funeral later day?

""Laborous jobs punishment"": that's literally community service — uncontroversially supported sides almost sixty years, strong support [of Christian prison ministries](http://restorativejustice.org/restorative-justice/about-restorative-justice/tutorial-intro-to-restorative-justice/lesson-3-programs/community-service/#sthash.WNpHDdBx.InN4AFwO.dpbs). 

Up now, community service *universally* considered *restorative* (rather merely punitive) form punishment. 

Rather fining people money may have, isolating prison — none gives back society could taken redemptive individual — community service punishment gives back society provides existential meaning punishment, likely reduce recidivism.

The restrictions overwhelming public support, people breaking law virtually none, I'd suggest comment things know little nothing about.   Like said. guys fucked. Best luck.  riddance.

So believe China’s numbers many people died? Interesting - British government doesn’t... ... neither matter...

Keep keeping on, sweetheart! believe you!

I’ll go ahead add US established comprehensive testing contact tracing applicable didn’t even need violate citizens’ rights process. turns out, private business happy adapt require screened entering - knew? (Psst, US did) Could bad Sweden. Plenty studies done this, even one city country made mask wearing mandatory everyone else could see big drop cases 7-14 days.
The countries mask mandates strict rules social distancing. 
Are people really still argue masks work? Lol I'm pretty introverted getting me. Triply since can't even go outside smoke (West Coast). legitimate concern random employees bringing weapons lead fight turning bloodbath.

Yea, simp. Anything used weapon, especially clerk arms reach number items. case woman might saved life it. Lawsuit not, Rite Aid suck fat one. Considering average deaths 700s trending down, know cases trending moment, know deaths continue going next month so....the 440k death prediction requires us like 5000 deaths day average December. Things simply get bad, awful prediction.  
Honestly news social media probably blame promoting bad prediction. I'd imagine prediction like 260,000-440,000 media took highest number since would generate fear clicks. course Reddit gobbles number up. I'm sure people model saying ""guys prediction everything goes badly possibly could"". 9th country deaths per capita.

Yeah... Great work. Welcome 2020 gun shaped pop tarts get kicked school, necessarily pretty much  we’re able decrease IFR something closer flu

Will ever happen. Medicine work actual miracles. pushing people fatality column ""permanent lung injury"" column. Even snap fingers today made deaths go away still much catastrophic virus influenza. Wild stuff like what? guys still staying home going essentials? notice longer ""flatten curve"", whole original goal. basically cases acceptable horeshit unrealistic unless get vaccine soon. Congrats!   took getting 9th nation deaths per capita.

Federal Judge's job rule crime, action, law unlawful per existing Federal Laws Statutes.

As written today, 1st Amendment protects Right Peaceful Assembly. basically want argue Police Federal Gov't cannot violently disperse Protests due 1st Amendment, also can't restrict assembly due Pandemic either. Law isn't, usually can't be, nuanced lawmaker account every possible situation needs nuance, that's Court for. Specifically, SCOTUS's job provide nuance and, often history, rule favor people Gov't.

Additionally, 14th Amendment retroactively applies US Constitution, Amendments, State Governments well.

Note things like closing parks/pools issuing Mask Mandate within rights City, County, State issue blocked US Constitution. Though 10th Amendment *does* prohibit Federal Gov't issuing National Mask Mandate. America bad!

Maybe wearing mask make life hell, good you, can't assume everyone. ""...**don't try look rosy side things.""**

Dude, Americans unnecessarily optimistic people there. know I'm American! People smile smile. literally don’t think anyone thinks things look bleak all

Fucking moron. I'm anti-masker, nice straw man. everyone want country locked indefinitely, people forced labor camps, etc ""anti-mask"". wear one daily easy makes things keeping others safer.

However, many sub polar opposite anti-masker (i.e. good way). Retarded different reasons. Calling people forced dig mass graves America? Seriously? Calling masks social distancing ""new normal"" even vaccine? sub joke disconnected reality rest US even funny. ""enough test trace contain infections ""

We need technology like 2020 help recovery 2021. need tools, machines, better cable management? 

Like sounds like technological problems enough attention could solve, least positioning moving humans, like right solutions probably not.

That bed dope, manage cables though? think I’ll too. Wearing mask sick something that’s normalized many parts workd Son? study result yet published reviewed independent scientists, government confirmed Lilly’s statement accurate. lol. Hospitals operated surge capacity. 100% normal ICU capacity. Social distancing option poor people living dense cities. good cause; risky sure itll worth it. don’t disagree logic all. wtf  takes effort dick leave people alone. Define unnecessary risk. might aligned need drive (arguably actually required willing adjust life) risk moderately speeding. bet you’re actually going dump someone otherwise perfect thinks 5 ok don’t.

Same true here. Hopefully people lined big things suddenly scenario small details create giant rift... like it’s necessary see friends so, risky outside? It’s absolute. Skyrocketing now, rather then. nothing. bought time. went movies Friday afternoon. party 2 made half attendance. Nobody sat within 40 feet us. Good lockdown forever. Statistically young people don't. Hospitalisation deaths heavily stacked 50s.

Their idea work can't separate age groups, wrong make youll droves young people icu . agree, it’s also true eating indoors mask-less activity therefore different activities described. Shocking :0 Boooo less sustainable dead?  Level technology good way, course handwaved conspiracy theorists. example, moon landing. shadows parallel. indicates source light incredibly far away (the sun.) order recreate that, would need thousands *white* lasers. Which, back then, stupidly expensive, point would cheaper easier to, know, actually go moon take photo. Plus excellent point many thousands (possibly tens thousands) different people would involved? 

Adam ruins everything excellent episode conspiracies ""To hell fellow man."" unwilling make even smallest sacrifice. presence virus always show symptoms. never come lockdown. need zero tolerance disease. opening cause cases. stuff air even masks 100 percent effective. many people comfortable killing people get haircuts? flu thing jackass. Cases going nationally. Whatever plan is, need stick ...they don’t one? done Pfizer, American company, Bio-N-Tech, German one Except exactly Fauci said....you won’t getting one mid next year unless first responder high risk group. obvious? Lots stuff “may” happen. country's state health advisor said thing, ignored.

Might self-confessed communist, tweeted second wave fault ""extreme right"" (as two right wing parties, close 50% vote) said TV ""natural selection"" would give deserve. Even though evidence points irresponsible youth vacationers culprit.

Yes, state health advisor blamed right, scientific evidence, said anyone right centre dies, asked it.

After supposedly trusted expert, said voters collectively gave guy finger moved life. bet lot people intentionally exact opposite says going forward. Indonesia catching India I'm sure. people give shit masks social distancing etc. massive anti masks protests Germany. ""nice"" thing think point US proven virus relatively easy keep lid on. know others, quite bit easier personally thought several months back. 

Don't get wrong, US response absolute shit show pretty much across board. that's solid example I'm saying here. We've really done fucking nothing grand scheme things. never anything even resembling national plan, various locales completely half-assed it. Nowhere ever actual lockdown, areas mandated masks late all, demonstrably high risk businesses like restaurants bars operation time, we've even stopped shit like amusement parks, Sturgis, etc. 

But look results. Yes we're losing thousand people day, awful unnecessary. Again, one word defense US response. what's happening virus ripping population unchecked. curve exponentially increasing, two times far been, we've able tamp back with, again, pretty half-assed half-wit measures. 

In mind, gives sort silver lining situation, US whole world (or least developed world getting vaccine somewhat soon). US made lab rat, experiment ""exactly shitty response still capable flattening curve"". answer seems be.... pretty damn shitty. pretty much know exactly easy avoid overwhelming hospitals. turns really take much effort. although losing hundreds thousands countrymen totally unnecessary people probably need going jail, one good thing showed us (or least showed me) looks like really half-ass way make vaccine without virus ever really consuming whole population. 

It's fucking pathetic best do, way relieving know seems barely ""enough"". Works would great. Work, manufactured distribution totally different things however. Wtf talking about? whole point vaccine immune response.   Uhhh Mexico??? India? understand USA cynical point believe lessons learned all. lesson actively invest public health bodies research, we've seen UK US (and many countries aside, I'm sure) bodies tasked preventing dealing pandemics underfunded, ignored, scapegoated. chief executive Public Health England's replacement Tory life peer presided one country's biggest ever data breaches old job. can't make shit up. Good you! Stay course. Yeah. Losing spectators certainly bother Olympic games. It'll probably save it'll cost them. Crowd management expensive. Selling TV rights lot easier far lucrative.

Ya'll cheer this. wont. agree punishment deterrent. far extreme.

Next thing know, government use silence dissent control population shit like Flu, similar outbreaks, health concerns. still don’t understand Wednesday Thursday valid results, others decreased lazy non reporting

If that’s case actual numbers disappear retroactively added.

7day average still doesn’t account missed deaths 5% vaccine referring to? Ha ha wish. local drugstore that's supposed ""known low prices"".

Isn't headlines that's US recently Woodward's book? Trump knew serious back Feb downplayed beginning? Hahaha nice bullshit number crunching hell maskless people violent? I'm half expecting article bank robbery robbers wearing masks, everyone else is. 

Also Jesus racist article American voters see, lawless blacks threatening them. Trump wins easily November. Three cheers police, keeps killing looting rest us. know. sucks it’ll take years rebuild well city back February. would hate see closures happen vain there’s another outbreak like April. never ending string ambulance sirens post apocalyptic thing I’ve ever experienced. hard ""I'm healthcare expert can't comment. expert, listen say.""

He's interested pandemic. beginning, sent Pence handle briefings - Pence started getting good press Insecure Tiny Hands that!! got bored let scientists talk, *they* got good press - can't either!! Obviously knows everything better anyone else - I'm surprised solved Millenium Prizes yet.

Didn’t realize working ego, everyone wants fat lard. troll mean...everyone's info tracked USA well. data collection outsourced private sector (Facebook, Google, Amazon), US govt. happy step wants access data (under guise national security, investigation, etc.) agree totally completely, lot people still think outdoor dining socializing happening right now. Hell, even recent ""studies"" linking greater infection rates restaurants making distinction outdoor indoor dining. reasonable person look data assess risk, course, think lot people terrified repercussions ever ""found out"" social circles. [He said] Fauci: …There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is

It surgeon general thinking said directly interview Fox News' ""Fox &amp; Friends"" Monday, Adams said wearing face masks could actually increase person's risk contracting ""You increase risk getting wearing mask health care provider,"" really needs shit get pot. forced dig graves. epitome squandered wealth lmao Yeah..apParently don't. 

Herd immunity: Herd immunity (or community immunity) occurs high percentage community immune disease (through vaccination and/or prior illness), making spread disease person person unlikely. Even individuals vaccinated (such newborns immunocompromised) offered protection disease little opportunity spread within community.

Source: case missed it: 

There vaccine 
There immunity disease. 

So heard immunity possible. Okay good know. masks give people less severe infection, would possible we’d reach herd immunity quickly thought less deaths hopefully life long damage? I’m hopeful thats whats going happen doubt actually will. family Placer County. enforcing masks employees wearing masks store. Someone reported them. Placer County called repercussions, person called said follow complaint-but person phone even address mask policy. 

They still enforce masks store. frustrating family stupid, putting people risk, placer county shrugged basically said 'I check name list people call, good one' Amusing.... hours later story appears talking Denmark surge new cases new cases per day Sweden.

Doesn't sound like success me... makes think don’t heat air handlers unit ventilators?

Do link that? find articles interviews he's doubled defended guidance regards wearing masks people hoard N95s surgical masks, would've screwed medical professionals. Well, China lied covered Wuhan outbreak, SARS like faking stats. sure gather ""facts"" observe, one thing seems obvious, know much China one cheap Wuamos. United Airlines. terminals 100% mask compliance. even felt guilty changing mask 

I flew air Canada got La Guardia united airlines 2 flights that, say put masks 
And checked up. might also airline 🤷‍♂️ Yup, arguing latter. Restrictions self imposed otherwise work. ironically issues ""pro-Democracy"" factions trying sabotage anti-pandemic process attempt make HK government look bad. burned test clinics, vandalized quarantine centers, incited strikes politicized medical staff, launched movement boycott city-wide (e.g. know, shit expect American far-right pull)/. also ironically, get far since CCP power (guess evil right side time).

Yikes, sound less like ""pro-democracy"", like GOP / Trump base types. guess lesson trying paint two sides good evil way simplistic Right - escalation situation /her/ fault. dealing dum dums violent tenancies way all.

Nope, fault. /s  


I hope sues wins. clear name, principle it.  protect HER? That's fair, restaurants completely closed despite fact NYC one lowest infection rates country. DeBlasio even allow outdoor receptions partial openings. result, many restaurants permanently closed. killed doubt Rite Aid would anything say unfortunate. single frustrating thing pandemic me. doesn’t make feel safe, makes feel frustrated better ways could use money (feeding hungry, helping small businesses survive, giving people live paycheck paycheck means quarantine name few). squat bench gym? safe car.

Awesome.

Where’s peer reviewed sources? that’s claim tested science, cherry picking ain’t way go so. Yes, was. successful, clumsy messy, matter worked. fact, trying tear something down, clumsy, messy, chaotic come it. Props ending April, one first ones. would second wave? likely one long wave fewer people infect time immunity. go self isolate two weeks after? would middle ground (assuming low risk). reality they're actually drunk think people vote blue welfare gay.

Unfortunately I'm sure options beyond KN95s, think they're that's available here. months, weren't. lockdowns lifted community outbreaks curbed. assumed functional since smell anything wore them.

And yeah, read aersolised spread opposed droplet spread early wanted get sort medical grade masking beyond cloth masks. What's worse people masking anymore fairly distressing going back university like this. say whatever trump tells pandemic seems exceptionally good showing deficient stark terrible ways — countries individual people. 😜

We’ll tell stories grand children crazy fun could still go person music festivals, watch ballet person, “non essential” activities. Doubt Japan would want hold without tourism truth PPE shortage due selfish hoarders; also largely due administrative incompetence, responded shifting blame people.

Absolutely. Ebola, Zika, H1N1 epidemics Obama era, US government assisted countries fighting diseases, want hit American shores, stop tracks begin. Republican obstructionism funding projects forced Obama administration dip national PPE stock, funding come Republican Congress instead, America would subsequently much prepared pandemic. Trump administration 2 years full executive congressional control replenish stocks nothing it.

I place blame squarely Republicans lack preparation that's contributed fiasco occurring. wonder long take type people learn. value life? saying deaths covid-19 natural? Would plague killing people considered natural deaths? deaths pollution natural? deaths car crashes, cigarettes, natural? deaths bee stings shark bites natural? suicides murders considered natural? also live NoDak, people pretty flippant masks. Bars packed, kids back school. Yes, undo life imprisonment lot easier medical experimentation execution. Yes, convenient thing point fingers many ways deserved.

But put blame entirely us. government begins opening society, opening pubs, gyms, schools, shops restaurants tells us safe. Young people first start going places thus risk infection. can't surprised that.

They even gave £10 vouchers people eat restaurants, apply takeaway food. middle pandemic.

There's also fact young adults teenagers far likely working customer facing jobs, retail food industry usually.  ""What doesn't"" always counter-argument. 

I wish rule forbids media using could, might, maybe, headline. clickbait fear mongering + pseudo science point. Start assigning deaths reasons it’ll go too. reason rooms different air pressure hospitals too, patients airborne viruses. Impossible task.  billion doses end 2021

Weird, right? currently restrictions four legitimate reasons leave home, protesting one them.

Perhaps that's something that's wrong system. Eh goes parents. guarantee there’s bunch kids cool masks thinking “goddammit guys stop embarrassing me” Yet rules based around religious appeasement, impact efficacy measure virus. So, silly. Please tell isn’t real... similar scale all. IFR thought around 0.5% people either elderly and/or serious underlying health conditions. die something. noticed recently videos focusing good stuff worries me. good job Given fact demand likely exceed supply early stages, nothing.

By means take place back line vaccinations; post anything increase others' fear unjustifiably, delay unnecessarily - 100 million Americans vaccinated apparent ill effects (or least small number side-effects much safer vaccinated Covid), sure it'll safe you. I'm sure ""rushed"" right term describe ""staying closed 6 months."" Yes. mild infections deadly infect elderly vulnerable. Ummm...  cares guards staff bring virus back home right?  Masks protect everyone wearer wearer everyone really make sense. Kids also much likely touch eyes put hands mouth.

No? truth social distancing, lockdowns, development better treatments mitigated virus's spread all, would encouraging us stick strategies? Pedagogic level: Masterclass.  read studies everyone pushing around support wearing masks, actually read them. study two layer cloth masks surgical masks study wearing masks outside healthcare centers. e., mask almost everyone mandated wear context they're mandated wear in. 

Meanwhile numbers dead completely inflated. case numbers also inflated. folks selling PCR tests (LabCorp Quest Diagnostics) admitted fraudsters who've intentionally sold fraudulent diagnostic tests tests past, defrauded Medicare, engaged illegal kickbacks healthcare professionals. get say anti vaxers conspiracy theorists

When ever say that? Please put words mouth.

My personal belief based experience anti-vaccers conspiracy theorists (some are, not). simply well intentioned, uninformed parents getting bad information using bad information online make health decisions with. organized group individuals pushing anti-vacc movement, anti-vacc parents pushing movement simply got caught it. people convinced otherwise simple conversations private trying make people get vaccinate

One way create confusion around virus vaccine well amplifying racial economic divisions - know intel reports online bots trolls. conspiracy. confirmed intel reports. anecdotes area going maskless months large scale deaths change mind all.

Thats pretty messed way punish someone. going deliberately slow roll vaccine rollout?

No, people **highly** underestimate amount planning number variables consideration:

* number candidates, three four different ways vaccines work. vaccines work different ways, different groups benefit different vaccines, meaning need different plans handling vaccine.

* storage transportation issues. vaccines fine normal cold-chain transportation (about 35-45F), need stored transported -4F, others whopping -94F. fridges go low, they're usually mobile; mobile big need transport *lots* vaccine many different locations.

* Several vaccines need mixed site, meaning need [I forget name profession, something average medical professional does] hand mix vaccines.

* vial needs used within 6 hours vial opened: set arrange scheduling maximize number people get vaccine waste crowds people congregating pandemic.

* need nurse location monitor adverse reactions. They'll need training potential issues specific vaccine that's given. hospital needs requirements home life, nurses somewhat short supply right now.

* vaccines need follow-up shot: need record-keeping determine got shot when, plus need schedule follow-up visit area, halves number people vaccinate given time. We're going need kind infrastructure that, screen people reason get shots prioritize them, schedule appointments follow-up shots, robo-call remind people follow-up shots, allow flexibility get it. software written internet-accessible, usable different devices/platforms, secure HIPAA-compliant.

* Oh, vaccines need follow-up shots slightly different schedules, like one vaccine needs follow-up shot two weeks another three. Sounds like minor thing, complicates planning.

* people able get vaccine initial follow-up appointment, miss appointment. means actually need schedule minimum 3-4 visits per area.

There complications, just, *Hey, send vaccines local CVS let people come feel like it*. hospitalisations increasing then? Hope someone starts gofundme her. data analysis, got data sources claim? People spend time outdoors sun less likely test positive covid-19. Currently, 0.5 % IFR, 1.5% CFR.

Debate state Assembly stretched past midnight, lawmakers voted overwhelmingly favor legislation, gave Mr. C authority “issue directive” pandemic disease outbreak “necessary cope disaster.” language broader many state emergency powers laws, said Lawrence Gostin, Georgetown University law professor.

Then came news second coronavirus case— Lawrence Garbuz, 50-year-old lawyer New Rochelle commuted Manhattan. hadn’t traveled countries outbreaks, leading health officials conclude worst: contracted virus locally, indicating Covid-19 spreading community.

By second week March, hospitalizations growing day.

Mr. C’s staff integrated policy messaging, organizing PowerPoint presentation formed core governor’s daily news conferences, became national source information virus. governor relied Dr. Zucker members inner circle consult outside epidemiologists data scientists, although sought input virus experts hospital executives himself, according aides people spoke. Mr. Cuomo Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, spoke frequently.

The governor team micromanaged work state Health Department phoned agency officials requests weren’t immediately fulfilled. viewed agency sleepy bureaucratic, officials involved response said.

State agencies, including Health Department, needed permission governor’s office issuing policies areas expertise. Agency personnel local elected officials sometimes surprised learn new initiatives Mr. C’s news conferences, said.

Several top agency officials stepped since crisis began, including health department’s No. 2 official, Sally Dreslin, left April. Health Department spokesman said Ms. Dreslin took leave personal reasons “any suggested exodus DOH leadership doesn’t take account number people delayed retirement returned retirement help manage pandemic.”

The state’s biggest frustration testing. Without it, officials way measuring spread virus.

The initial test kits state received Centers Disease Control Prevention contained [a flaw rendered Mr. C lobbied federal government cede control testing New York health department.

He continued describe virus “bad flu,” exhorted New Yorkers remain calm said trying avert shutdown. “What we’re really trying avoid massive disruption closing everything two weeks, way China did, way Italy doing,” said March 8 Fox News interview.

On March 12, state federal approval certify private labs coronavirus testing. time, New York conducted fewer 3,000 tests state 19 million, virus spread widely restrained targeted testing, isolation contact tracing.

“You could argue horse left barn point,” said Mr. Shaman, director Columbia University’s Climate Health Program, worked Covid-19 models New York City.

The data coming start third week March frightening: 158 950 New Yorkers tested positive coronavirus hospitalized, governor said March 16 briefing. Yes. I’d rather unvarnished truth lies misdirection. We’ll see happens trials complete. 

Personally, number people looking nothing sunshine roses, don’t know generally known vaccines come risks. It’s fine print. 

It’s totally possible small number people suffer adverse neurological outcome vaccine. that’s case, better tell people truth front rather allow people unknowingly run risk.  sounds like everyone know flu back December (which also happened flu season). Although tested positive influenza, swear Covid.🙄 Except case, pitbull person claiming attacked neighborhood.

Mr. C aides said state shut soon possible, death toll would earlier closing federal government’s failure ban flights Europe launch national testing program. blinded everyone movement virus, said.

“The exact extent seeding coronavirus New York didn’t shut one, two, three, four days earlier,” said Melissa DeRosa, governor’s top aide. “It’s five weeks nobody knew it.”

 

Today, virus longer appears grip state. New York City opening school buildings large cities offering virtual instruction. rate positive coronavirus tests statewide—which topped 40% April—has 1% month.

Mr. C aides attributed results tight control state’s response, prevented businesses, counties cities reopening whenever wanted. states ceded authority local officials forced backtrack reopening initiatives—something hasn’t happened date New York. Polls show majority New Yorkers approved Mr. C’s handling crisis.

Isn't lockdown Victoria one longest world now? something home

Except stops working entirely recipient decides close email Twitter. think seeing devolution human beings first hands America. 2020 keep getting better better. way accent get weaker replace it, linguistics essentially mimicry, people repeat hear. spend time around people one accent thick spend time different accents becomes diluted. Yeah, nah. grandpa died covid nursing home. know, old weak, blah blah blah, likely would lived many years, kind person pissed die, makes sense. fact, day died, thought turning corner nursing staff said back pissed off.

Even tests - got nursing home hospital transfer, tested negative, positive two days later.

It earlier whole pandemic thing resources knowledge needed even try keep everyone safe. Yeah, shits fucked yo.   Volunteers free narcotic addiction hepatitis,  everything stay closed forever? move mexican wall canadian border spain, state governors deliberately kept paltry amount tracers prohibited mention nationalities regardless - fucking wish articles like came out. 

this second wave entirely idgaf anti-masker hoax-preaching travellers labourers countries never stringent lockdown. 

despite every fucking evidence community wide contagion spreading, 8,000+ cases day, spain continue reject second lockdown, proceed reopening schools according plans written may first lockdown effect. 

after heavy lifting 3 fucking months, back square one back ideological decision-making. 

tourists ""freedom movement"" packed hospitals destroyed families /r/Moronavirus honestly cannot tell joking. 

Are saying every single law violation free will? favor laws? That's happened Hawaii. part reasonably straight forward get things organized. It’s cost build run (they use LOT energy) ultra low temperature freezers, expensive, complex, highly engineered machines. Sounds like Pfizer developed source scaled freezers (they wouldn’t actually make freezers) it’d massive investment risk purchase enough vaccine approved. won’t !!! people think 100% populace comply. won’t happen matter punishments, restrictions rules. Literally one cares American accent here. Redditors saying shit like ""hurdurr say I'm Canadian"" cringe lol... Yeah, learned that, DOD involved handling logistics. False. Seriously stop trying twist things fit agenda. gonna fly man...

""BEIJING, Sept. 13 (Xinhua): new locally-transmitted Covid-19 cases reported Saturday across Chinese mainland, National Health Commission said Sunday. 28th day country local coronavirus cases.

A total 10 confirmed Covid-19 cases reported Saturday outside mainland, commission said daily report.""

They detected 10 cases, imported zero cases local. means detected local cases 28 days; fact caught 10 imported cases means they're still testing. go detail? side effects? severe? legit firstest first world problems. 
I'm getting aggravated assholes treat staff like shit. That's fair creative punishment thier daily report infections worded way like must false. 21st century natural selection work. Let weed gene pool. guy wrote article seem smart himself. 2, writes he's interested number new cases, rate change today cases. realize thing?

Also, uncontrolled growth exponential, slower. virus spreads, survivors gain immunity.

And anyone wants see expert failure academia rivals politician's failure, look shitshow IHME. please get facts straight posting. Argentina pretty strict lockdown July case numbers low compared countries Latin America. pressure ease restrictions, government eased lockdown measures. Since then, case numbers increased dramatically. mean tested antibodies results showed induced immunity? so, doubt placebo.  americans speak german. guarantee sound nothing like english businessman speaks german. confirm. Building lessons completely online really time-consuming. spent 6 hours 2 hour class now.

I mean great get use again. unlikely school teachers need stay virtual vaccine found. pretend Canadian. Yes know, least first step. really hope simulations grown tissue (without using fetal ""food"") bale stop this. could stopped right totally experimental tests, scientists curious something, without need it. Sure. Assuming actually happens anyone afford it?  +4 years saw theater? like? agree, distance learning best. Sadly girl family sending 11 year old back school, despite five people house 60. I'm dad, nothing do. guess kid wants go back, terrified getting sick even grandparents/great grandparents/great uncle. What's gonna happen weeks kids inevitably start testing positive, tell fault?

The whole ""upgrading ventilation systems"" seems like whole lot time, effort, money something even know would work. Let's save time, effort, money hell lot unneeded guilt. Shanghai particular spent last several years working hygiene issues, even living spitting got less less street food completely disappeared. 

Mask wearing, rapid home delivery goods, regular temperature checks normalized Covid, seems like authoritarian government cracking fully everyone complying would basically trick. 

Anyway - silence poor people remote western provinces, can’t silence hundreds millions wealthy middle-class city dwellers personal health stake. initial outbreak taught us that. engage. Kinetic Douchebag encourages people talk children web. deep comment history, like 18 months ago, wanted warn countries large number coronavirus deniers? thought primarily US thing... reddit supporting forced labor people disagree them, nice. Mexico, test us  feel like doctors scientists optimistic vaccine. I’m sure dying work factory poor working conditions could described “godsend”. Jesus Christ kind fucked reality in?  Don’t agree Science ™️? Gulag then! Oh get yourself. Someone making attempt speak local language generally appreciated wherever are, USA Germany remote island Pacific somewhere. effort means accent, especially ""not seeming like stereotypical, selfish American"" category. agree! Grow buy local! ✊

I’m actually amazed I’ve able grow inside apartment. 8 different herbs, sprouts, mushrooms potatoes! Yeah know, means imply human lifes automatically worth animal life, regardless whether ones profiting not. find kind mindset disturbing.

What agree enough people volunteering. Many studies far much applicants need, suggesting contrary. bot, mean regurgitating false information without questioning validity. :) (and point..that realm possible next decade) like too. Pre-pandemic, wished socially acceptable wear mask cold/flu season/when sick like Asian countries. want look ""weird"" masks required, probably going keep wearing winter/when sick (and mean getting something, deathly sick). Fair enough, chemicals ingredients vegan products use previously tested animals. Fair enough shampoo tested, somewhere line guarantee chemical shampoo tested animals. goes bottled packaged foods. That’s horrible! Sids always concern mine.
When year+ finally rejoiced ‘fragile baby period’ over.

One day wife went house doctor seemed dehydrated. doctor didn’t know make send hospital checked out.

My wife called me, driving home work, go ER something went well.

It busy day eldest daughter (a year older baby sister) became unbearable, since wait long brought grandparents.

Just came back wife texted something wrong hurry.
Our baby already gone cardiac arrest point doctors/medical staff kept poring room knew fuck happening pulled every rabbit asses save child. 

They tried best whole hour. Seeing baby daughter reanimated eventually dead operating table horrible thing I’ve ever seen life. leave hospital empty carrier explain eldest baby sis died saddest experience I’ve ever had.

Month months research later turned ultra rare general disorder basically makes heart grow it’s much die.
We never knew, could’ve never known. exactly. right fancy burger, right nutritional slop would allow survive. hot take.  Vaccines face similar supply curve hand sanitizer TP. March, scarce valuable. plentiful taking shelf space. kinds stupid interpretation that? 

The best kind. technically correct kind. Stop trying minimize pandemic kill Americans flu pandemic 1918. It’s yo daddy, sucka! Pick Warbreaker want change. Idk, East South Germany month people thought American. figured British, Irish, maybe even Australian.

I'm southeast, southern accent. Loool bullshit title western news medium. Hmmm.   might want ask question. “No Local Covid-19 cases 28 days” mean you? people may double stupid conspiracies intent make undeniable reality people refuse accept it. think someone dig grave burry dead result called plandemic conspiracy virus might take seriously. bleach toilet bowl cleaner, Mr. President? ""just everybody gets vaccinated""

Why? they're running millions tests day getting zero, zero?

Also, I'm bot surely China rule world soon invincible army human level intelligent robots? clearly putting overexaggerated, thoughtless views words calling enemy. 

I said support community service. Stop idiot ready pump put hundreds millions doses countries Hey, stocked 1-ply.

And I'm still using TP bought March. bought two packages it, too.

Not fault people like wasteful 2-ply.  Sort of. Many state governments reopening - local lockdown - plans, little centralized actions federal government (in fact, Bolsonaro compared COVID-19 ""a little flu"" ""a little cold"" said that, seniors part risk group, ""why shut schools?"", statements given nationally-televised address!). know goes brain read, man...

""No new locally-transmitted Covid-19 cases REPORTED"" implies still testing. yes, still testing. That's entirely true. value dollar needs reasonably represent factor production economic activity. Without something real behind it, currency's value diminished. short term, print want without much consequence. Long term results damaging inflation worse.

The Fed also pumping money economy since 2009. Lending rates necessarily representative function. - research google search state pass going lifetime event. Global warming going make regular occurrence. SARS1 17 years ago. We'll see something like again, probably sooner 17 years. next one could worse virus, sure worse response. I'm using vegan products know tested animals really use many products apart food clothing anyways. 

The problem medicine... legal way right produce without testing animals.  That’s forced servitude. It’s forced labor.

So think community service committing crime wrong abolished? ""forced servitude."" 

You also might want look 13th Amendment. Something legal *[not] make right/ethical, got issue legal.  might also want take look at: denying testing denying might get Covid transmission abroad, number 0 real saying -1. Also feel like I’m debating bot...🤔 Rights thee live Mississippi one I’ve ever met outhouse I’ve never seen one. extremely anti-mask, kept congregating large groups well...

Basically, imagine shittiest behavior see Americans. Give large, close families. put extremely dense urban areas. make religiously obligated regularly form groups ten more. 

Total shitshow. countries completely flat 7-day average newly discovered cases per capita. I’m caution cases like Poland, truly safe go holidays. confirmed case yesterday. included yesterday's statistics? management ever unionized? kinda goes job role. I’m guessing doesn’t even count 40% asymptotic  Yeah like every week get going Wuhan investigate article 

But nothing ever comes rose-colored glasses here. lives works locally. see references US military articles. problem HHS FDA. FDA actually trying right thing HHS keeps stepping prevent FDA regulating things appropriately. 

Just one example HHS indicating lab developed tests need FDA review FDA since start pandemic. means lab developed tests longer need prove work regulatory agency widely used. Politicizing virus vaccine probably one worse mistakes. Getting people trust vaccine going one hardest chapters pandemic, hopefully final one.  bad, super strict 4 months... Fuck Rite Aid  almost certainly Washington University (The St Louis, Missouri medical school) vaccine report, I'm glad Oxford team jumping it. We'll likely end mRNA vaccines round one slow virus, hopefully mouse results replicated humans end proper sterilizing immunity wipe wretched disease planet. We're running words shit Yeah million dead Americans let go it’s course. What’s big deal? Yep, new allies UAE Israel work together rig election. Deliver Trump vaccine Nov 3. saw someone post following social media : “The flu vaccine still kills thousands year. Educating panicked” 


This stupid ignorant. person apparently know flu vaccines don’t 100% effectiveness (although goal) 

Even vaccine 60-70%, still better vaccine 

It’s amazing 2020 people told this. seems everyone left dark ages  Yes, much dependent effective reproductive number, dependent population behavior. keep R 1, effective 'herd immunity'. lower keep 1, lower threshold % immunity we'd need population prevent growth.   I'm sure voted. Everybody, mean everybody, coping mechanisms deal negative aspects reality. sat day researched every tragic issue happening world would inevitably fall depression (assuming capable love empathy). respect evolutionary biology, humans evolve worry society issues big picture level. Humans born understanding society issues encoded DNA. learned things observing natural world human societies within world.

The issue deploying techniques face COVID-19 crisis imagined ""truths"" imagined realities real, imagined, consequences. imagined myths perpetuated world wide speed never seen thanks internet, social media, etc. People feel good knowing others believe imagined myths share describe comfortable delusion together block reality objectively great right compared past (pre-covid). Lol works us military. Fail part.

You seem still wearing Rose tinted lenses.

The world banned Americans travelling hates Americans poorly deal virus.

Its blame americans worst outbreak wealthiest country. Normally would make sense poor countries hit people need make living dont welfare. us?

This pathetic. country many anti mask protestors america. 


Accept blame shitty state country even everything book, neighbours didn't, Arizona. confirm. dead. Dakota sure loves winning. thinning stupid eye surgeon similar. Last month check trying explain Covid 2 5 pandemic scale worry anything. casually remarks tech room minutes held eyelids open put drops eye thought Covid recently! also believe HCQ work gets Covid. respected field man hate go office post op checkups. problem orange house cards GOP brainwashing powerful. They've conflated identity political beliefs unable distinguish attacks political ideas personal attacks. soon admit obvious lies fooled whole fragile house ideological cards comes crashing down. they'll never it. cult. never said support extending lockdown neither upper class.I live remote coastal village Kerala ffs.I even gone volunteering,so go assuming things stranger internet.

Anyways getting back point,what meant lockdown slowly lost stringency months(I relating anything plight poor people here).All wanted say lockdown poorly implemented planned start,but guess took another way.

And clarification,I want lockdown extended personal financial reasons.But time restrictions place,then healthcare system already barely hanging thread collapse.It's catch 22 situation really. r/riteaidsucks if/when pandemic subsides get cops called guy wearing mask public? Walking bank mask attempted robbery. Walk bait tackle shop one (before Covid) you’ll get shot.
Edit: clarity. Ugh. get started one. explain I'm taking basic percautions like wearing mask &amp; keeping distance office setting there's reason would even need closer 6 feet gotten old quickly. No, I'm terrified. realized chances fine. take percautions take practically effort? WASHINGTON — top communications official powerful cabinet department charge combating coronavirus accused career government scientists Sunday “sedition” handling pandemic warned left-wing hit squads preparing armed insurrection Caputo, 58, assistant secretary public affairs Department Health Human Services, said without evidence Centers Disease Control Prevention harboring “resistance unit” determined undermine President Trump. ""trolls"" refer absolutely hate America, fact opposite. hate administration overall hijacking government political system billionaire class done America. love country, want fix beyond repair. I'm sure aware not, $1,200 stimulus check comparable CERB since stimulus available everybody. $600/week CARES act would equivalent CERB. I’ve recurring mild headaches past several months think that’s due stress anything. 

I’ve cancel several vacations work essential job. winters coming. Yeah, kind depressing. honest, think many us COVID burn out. fact, started singing Happy Birthday washing hands today seeing current numbers. think I've done since June.  think Gould Sagan said something effect of, ""In common parlance people use word theory mean imperfect guess, way scientists use term."" Evolutionary theory remarkably robust scientific framework life know it, ""theory"" part comes trying better understand mechanisms occurs, occurred all. don’t think so. “no weapons policies” guarantee justifiable firing. 

Although argue pocket knife tool, weapon, argument goes window use weapon.  mental toughness

Yeah fair there’s zero chance don’t hang continues 2 years. Frankly I’m amazed I’m alive now. It’s whatever though. I’ll keep going run go. don’t make that’s way read article, brief was. basically leatherman Swiss army, utility tool “weapon” - book maybe eyes law Rite Aid policy. 

As far overstepping boundaries trying “enforce state mandate”, looking customers store.

Pretty shitty deal Rite Aid. 

r/riteaidsucks Hopefully Kamala Harris stops anti vaccination rhetoric. incredibly dangerous. one figured character troll account, huh? Shit like par course retail pharmacy. pharmacy technician 8 years. Customers would verbally abusive sometimes threaten us littlest thing. talked back God forbid defended write-up termination. 
 
I saw customer call coworker n-bomb...she stood refused serve lady.. Corprate wrote colleague up, gave racist asshole gift cards apologized. live law can't leave house year? Evolutionary biologist Bret Weinstein also made claim virus appears missing links would show jumped animals humans, it’s uniquely suited transmission lab lab-like environment, namely indoors. Says who? works Canada.

pity. I'm sure can, need to. device broadcasts device ID, Device ID detected within demarcated geographic area (called geo-fencing) get ad pushed phone. Snapchat specializes that, every ad platform offers kind geo-fencing capability Good know, thanks tip! wear face mask  Mumbai wonderful city economy. Great people too. feel - current cdc recs positive covid quarentine time without symptoms 10 days. doc clear prior feel okay phone. see conflict interest person wants leave quarentine minimal symptoms. 20 day quarentine ever symptomatic. need federal mandate? Every airline enforcing this. 

Someone stubborn enough delay flight wearing mask point going slowed another mandate. great thing see. Here’s hoping continues states start following path! sucks definitive end knows things go somewhat back normal. There’s also little look forward weekends visiting friends/family extremely limited hard do. Exaggerating much? gone four weeks midsummer, something quite common Sweden. took works pretty well. COVID-19-projections estimates 15.5% people anyone know talking says every time lift restrictions, cases go again? checked states see true. checked New York, RI, Florida, TX others, can’t see places case. Maybe Massachusetts degree rose low 150/day around 350 mid Aug.

I sure telling truth official doesn’t lie. need time better info deniers there. simple masks still expensive? would think 6 months could get n95 problem. Adopt emergency regulation, executive order, FDA/CMS waiver

Fuck no. solution let companies waive Federal regulations lol. Fucking psychopaths  Fingers crossed I'm confident feels like matter number going keep going one else cares it’s unavoidable

This one ""it's marathon, sprint"" situations. Covid largely avoidable individuals wear masks, maintain social distancing, avoid crowded indoor spaces poor ventilation. number infections continue go people things, something avoid individually via actions. 

It might take year two things get stop, terribly difficult things maintain. require mental toughness, though. course everyone wants return normal life pandemic, reality says otherwise wishing away effect virus.

A lot come avoiding infection going perseverance, delaying gratification, tolerance boredom. Obviously strong suits American culture general, individual choose behave differently Guranteed rat face actions. smell putrid sense entitlement. classic Karen. u/spez 不会开心的。 Yup. pandemic disappears people think fake finally get proof late. Can't say I'll miss them. social life pandemic pretty much left house work. I'm year 6 causing real brain damage. Boycott. That’s US response complete utter shit. US basically reaching end 2nd wave like Europe couple months ago. EU going second wave mostly likely happen US around end October, least prediction. headline say real story: pulled knife customer. course fired. fire stabbed someone future, would fully liable, can't that. super easy, free, get tested TestNebraska, turnaround time sucks \~72 hours. There's people grumbling selling data (which found anything saying much), bid shifty, actual testing speed drive incredibly quick convenient.

There's also plenty testing avenues too.

Our governor still sucks though.  zero percent chance anyone tell spring look like. even Fauci accurate. can't tell us anything, nobody can. wrong lot. US basically reaching end 2nd wave like Europe couple months ago. EU going second wave mostly likely happen US around end October, least prediction. China one largest consumers petroleum power world. You’re wrong, there’s real-world incentive there, theoretical. everyone either already  almost like masks huge deal many adults make be. I’m Dr Fauci — he’s human: he’s made least one sizeable mistake early mask guidance. didn’t know found later: even homemade cloth masks make big difference. admitted mistake apologized. He’s done nothing since continue earn deserve respect don’t know US would without him.

And fucked-up thing. people would rather leaders would constantly lie things refuse admit wrong...instead owning mistake, moving forward.

Donald Trump-itis infected far people covid has. Yep, I’m ya. Even comment put ease little! I’m going relax day. brown/orange mucus sometimes cough sneeze likely due irritation lungs smoking releasing red blood cells, mean, good, Covid feel I’ve narrowed path little more. least moment haha. 

Very thankful understanding, praying get meaningful rest. calculate risk based actually seen person? partly joking anyway. *Partly*. asking people protest participation testing sites. determine spread without contact tracing certain events? study conducted economists btw. people research epidemiology study infectious diseases economists people still upvote trash Yup, I’m much introvert even craving go sort group activity. don’t usually like groups need fix every while. I’ve really craving concert, there’s something vibe 10k+ people jamming songs. They're trying kill us. something CDC can't then, right? understand ""trial"" used verb here, becomes clear. Educate stupid Afaik also difference swedish industry bit oriented around non-essential goods danish industry, also naturally vulnerable changes consumer spending. least that's hear denmark. mechanism expect people vet validate claims? It’s obvious Anyone tries focus solely positives pandemic, 200,000 Americans died, living denial reality. Chances matter death count quadruples, people care facts 200K, never will. testing places simple nasal swab others still deep swab method goes way brain? one method accurate other? Everything political opponents. disgusting asked one coronavirus ""a political thing created Democrats make Trump lose"" whole world problems. 

They became incredulous asked ""What problems?!"" said ""You know... Lockdowns.. deaths... Hospitals full... know... fucking PANDEMIC""

Their response? ""YEAH ok wait November magically disappears""

They really can't grasp stupid acting. end country end lot relationships. AZ numbers great lately across board. Positive rate, cases, hospital numbers, everything. Man, likelihood happening - especially 20s younger - low. 

I get it, it’s scary it’s big risk. really understand. point take risks order like fulfilled life! 

Every drink take adds risk suffering esophageal cancer. Every time play hockey football take risk long term brain injury. Every time drive car go boating cliff jumping take risk ending hospital bed.

I saying head concert, club packed restaurant right now. saying reaches point “you might put risk” worth it. 

Here’s helpful tip - take leave : get internet while. friends petrified virus “fear scroll” news.  bad is, hopefully flaws we’ve become acutely aware better addressed, something good come scheming get flu shots, view? 

""if even 30k flu hospitalizations winter (compared 300k normally) 30k beds can't go covid isn’t surface explanation adequate?

What surface explanation? getting flu shot?

I'm not. evidence clear Americans much less likely get flu year recent know CDC doesn’t?

Nothing. public health official, say things true bad public health policy.

How many flu hospitalizations think CDC report page coming flu season? would bet number far average. asswipe. enough outraged, aghast, terrified, humiliated Trump's actions comments, must mobilize overwhelming voter turnout send clear decisive message Trump right-wing base, demolition morals, decency, rule law tolerated presidency insult embarrassment us end overwhelmingly voted office November!📃📆✔📱 common symptoms back December, lasted 3 weeks. 

I’m 100% convinced then, good reason think might been.  Close friends traveling country mid November , thanksgiving got sick two weeks later.  got sick did. incognito private mode Lmao fuck downvoted  asking what? perhaps help explain  Victoria, Hawaii, Jakarta... Like 2 fronts WW2?

The Germans learned, however...the US? It’s fair say college safer cuz classroom safe. bring back students pandemic, also (or be) taking responsibility socializing partying. Think it. community college in, doesn’t really matter whether student contracted corona classroom campus party. Either way, infection could prevented college open first place

As elementary schools riskier vs college.. maybe. Maybe not. they’re certainly important individual kids society large. society needed take risk, certainly elementary schools vs college def vs bars, clubs, even restaurants FDA still allows things medications food products European Union banned years decades ago. take everything say grain salt research. I’m saying everything say invalid healthy dose skepticism self education goes long way I'm fan Chinese government. (US's) strategic rival future.

However, I'd like flexible enough thinking learn countries systems (China, Vietnam, Germany, whoever), rather assuming room improvement country.

Basically loyalty US nation, Western democracy system. part requires us (a) revisit assumptions (b) brutally honest. Pretty sure sore throat got common cold shit ass feels like go ass parts covid without becoming immune it

Edit Actually that’s kind wrong say sore throats rare symptom covid Mice lie, Petri dishes lie, statistics manipulate. Nothing here. Move  appalled something even happen?

It absolutely happened. Look sidebar votes percentage compared votes comments. clearly see people downvoting thread like implications. 

And far first time. common theme reddit resulted extremely biased coverage front pages. Right, people thought didn’t didn’t enough symptoms (or any) know did. line estimates, maybe even bit higher. think democracy help things, fact think make things worse. Imagine lobbying industry sinking deeper bureaucracy. Add this, people would idea candidates even qualified position. people won’t anything it, should. Speak up!!! China terrifying horrible place, even better handling spread virus are. Tons schools reopened everybody infected matter days. People given free tests, even harass stores mask mandates despite right store make masks mandatory. backwards constitutes freedoms given afford it. Paywall bypass link? Don’t cunt. one advantage place like China. take steps places aiming eradication

When country well pandemic control, country must undesirable traits makes work. country also sour tasting.

Good non-corrupt freedom-loving countries never conceivably good pandemic control completely mutually exclusive properties.

In words, North America Europe poorly COVID infections - that's fine. means decent noble countries.  Seems well written.  

If junk, please point parts appear false.

I'd interested hear criticism someone who's qualified criticize it. none hosts work enforce masks mandate. scared physically attacked fired. constantly asking let people without masks say afraid fired refusing someone entry , attacked. threatened least since mandate started. teenagers btw, threatened grown men. ""If make wear mask go ape shit here."". Someone said 16 year old girl.  Nope, cannot. Well Dr Li said SARS outbreak, know COVID different SARS Yes, stopped talking anythjng negative, exactly point. Yeah. nothing seems suspicious way everybody claims believe tampered lab gets treated. say ""you think is"" ""you know is"", enough say believe decent chance shadow banned social media platforms. Makes sense considering symptoms likely mild positive result would mean quarantine/no travelling/no social activities. I'd rather worried risk groups lived someone tbh. Yeah must hard see challenging way high horse. Keep lying discipline keep years I’m fines don’t think work. People contest legality eats time resources better spent elsewhere. would rather airlines shared no-fly list people added feel consequences actions. far know right fly private companies reserve right refuse service. impact $50 fine likely never paid. TIL ""egregious"" SNAFU science linguo... joke way conservatives joke homosexuals get first taste dick. LOCK EM hopefully wrong, always think right govt started subsidizing corn stuff. went downhill lol One might call crime humanity, intentionally spread misinformation pandemic. may true. try. truth must get out. took Labcorp **DiaSorin SARS-CoV-2 Ab, IgG** test came back POSITIVE.

Was never sick. Wondering ""false positive"". 

Or maybe I'm ""STRONG LIKE BULL!"". ever know went wrong? end study? ~60-75% can't math realize statistics show even though essential workers risk, elderly risk? thinking emotion, data.

Let's experiment. 2 grocery workers, 1 young 1 elderly, think get vaccinated first? meant bit oxygen deprivation 

If DNR hand, won’t intubate. Tbf, don’t think anyone thought global pandemic would cause massive shut downs we’ve seen. went business school never learned potential effects pandemic. think it’s something taught going future however. Yes, let get control deciding mask mandates right wrong everyone lives amount anxiety you. Life black white people created differently. might significant worrisome everyone. No, several larger installations U.S. already asked government (Pentagon/Defense Department) volunteer Phase III trials. open active duty dependents, again, voluntary five participating installations I've seen far. installations large cities (which makes sense).

So technically, military would/could access early on.. wanted volunteer They've earmarked 500 Mn doses India though. whole world knows trump sent position russians, also China hired special agent. never national forest, state national park? I'm sorry. reliable updates China?

Here's answer redditors undoubtedly want hear:

NO LIES. EVERYONE DYING CHINA. CORPSES STREETS!!! collectivist face-saving Chinese culture forcing Chinese pretend got spread control want look better Americans. even bribed Worldmeter tone numbers thousand fold 200k dead, 40M unemployed, president thinks it’s hoax, americans think things fine.

Looks pretty bleak Sinopharm vaccine going approved US November. even tested US. time get better understanding disease, treatments work best etc. Also risk overwhelming hospitals make medical staff prioritize patients even isn’t necessary, doctors claimed happened Sweden. US institutions lost authority Reagan part. Since they've coasting past reputation. Decades right wing destruction making obvious since then. end day guys, knife. ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY WEAPONS. can't sue shit.

What law abiding defenceless people world. country illegal carry knives street protection.

All workers put psychopaths every day manage without pull knife woman able abide laws. talking micro-level, I'm talking politicians pushing prematurely open economies knowing people die. Yes, balance. reckless push open certain businesses right now.

I'm camp thinks hide fear home keep everything closed. think opening bars large events. take mean afraid, also think everyone needs operate bit justifiable fear. burn stove, we're careful. watch someone else burn stove, we're careful. Yet, reason, huge population Reddit commenters think afraid disease fear mongering. Sorry, watching hundreds thousands people die ~6 months afraid becoming one them. pandemic, let's stop give room something people afraid enough fear maybe cautious.


(My English teacher would disappointed usage million words say something words could've illustrated: WEAR MASK!)


/end rant completely useless number fucked self-report. Alright. know two answers say thing, want point article confirms Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (SEHA) July collaborated Department Health - Abu Dhabi, G42 Healthcare Chinese pharmaceutical company **Sinopharm** CNBG — developer vaccine — facilitate third phase clinical trials. flu spray? Gotta honest, usually blow nose afterward cause really care. guess covid one, bet lot people would.  heads up, instacart time. markup tip paid 2500 extra last 6 months. sure, it’s better dying, chances contracting careful minimal. 2500 low ball want know true cost Lolol, “when pandemics over”

Even Covid numbers level still legally wear mask out. always able to. Makes sense. cousin went back school get GED. sat classroom weeks took open note open book test unlimited time take. Also, failed could take two times. Even failed 3 times could come back next day try again. proctors even allowed somewhat help (she said her’s gave answers questions on). joke education system become. Compare daily case counts daily death counts right cases preceding deaths, would seen upward trend sometime Mid-August. But, essentially flat since July. No. SHC014 appalled something even happen? like setting lose fight even decided fighting yet. Wait appalled something appalling actually occurs. umbrage impact way. Hopefully soon  surprising. signed executive order specifically reduce eliminate liability meat factories workers. words, workers can't sue factories covid related damage. great response, thank typically like provide nonsense banter doctor take flu shot. usually throw random conspiracy theory top off. he'll counter scientific studies, health insurance companies require minimum percentage patients insurance need take flu shot charged fee, counter conspiracy theory simple no. I'm usually low risk flu category, end, take flu shot.  
This year, asked usual said yes. stabbed moved on. covid much problem want fend covid flu time.  
  
get flu shot. save trouble figuring flu covid. type restrictions place? much, right? kinda Swedened it? don’t think convince hardcore denier.

Nothing convince people loved one dies corona maybe even then. internalized corona denial part belief structure. God convince point. many summer media saying second wave happen fall, seems like schedule virus? Yeah fuck anyone young. guys also extensive program genocide Muslims kids say, ""go guess"" anyone noticed word egregious used alot lately? I’m suprised youre still fauci. guy infectious disease doc. expert supposedly. It’s part hospital protocol *decades* wear masks protection viruses.... surgeon general went tv months telling people masks don’t help them. isn’t simple mistake book. it’s gross negligence someone field clearly knew harm anyway wife ""at risk"" category age disabilities. moron would risk family's health. said these, sorry say. still believe coronavirus numbers. guys still 1/4 population. 5th populous country. guys atleast 260-300k test day 27k. know poorest state country conducting 150k test day. see neighbouring countries like Iran even Nepal doing, impossible imagine Pakistan's daily death toll single figure, especially considering incompetant politicians moronic older generation is( offense too). Things look bleak country, getting worse every day. Yeah understand either. Local state governments adjust things get hand. Even Florida Texas made changes death rates never hit anywhere near NY April levels. reason believe going get far hand again. counter productive way? ask China divulge information Gain Function research? know well. went back 1,500 sqft looking house, smallest thing could buy area, even split two rent out, still accumulated much shit, miss small place looking downsize again. people YouTube tell silent majority win ;-;  We've reached end curve internet disservice us. happened 50 years ago believe would much easier issue unite everyone far less conspiracies. Yeah it’s confusing claims seasonal influenza IFR .1% CDC says seasonal influenza CFR .1%. Two completely different statistics quoted confusion ‘case’ ‘infection’ fatality rates (CFR vs. IFR)
In contrast, World Health Organization (WHO) stated flu infection fatality rate (IFR) 0.1% lower.
Who right?
The said influenza IFR 0.1%, or
The NIAID CDC directors said influenza CFR 0.1%?


The Working weekends changing schedule, much benefits, dealing people? thanks I'll tell protection, virus leave everyone. drastically altered wellbeing 4 months recovering. dont know ever same, based people r/covidlonghaulers , consider lucky.  Pfizer self funding project want deal politics OWS grant. said expanding trial 44k people include vulnerable groups. expansion also self funded. knew full general public approval coming October, would point that. Sounds like Pfizer trying things right Certain “leaders” US that. Okay fair enough, comparing essential workers; NYC MTA employees fatality rate 106 per 100,000 ConEd’s employees 61 per 100,000. 

So risk elevated compared communities, likely lower essential workers. would great healthcare stocks, bad working class. relevant? Hospitalization required long term health issues required pass virus along extended family may health issues. 

You’re part problem. tell dumb luck, bad luck.   China still actually believe anyone outside border believes one single word say? didnt, eradicating smallpox done worldwide intensively 1958 1977. parents 70s, likely vaccinated matter lived.

No? shut fuck up, people realize coronavirus deadly actual evidence, post sorely lacks. hear lot confusing. Covid deaths Thailand. implying government Thailand conspiring democrats discredit trump? Aah - reading comprehension issues play. explains lot. Also, apparently arithmetic deficiencies.

Yeah anti-science monkeys. need science monkeys. understand reluctance, callback Thalidomide catastrophe, safety standards vaccines pharma manufacturing changed much barely even comparable back then. Extensive data targeted used demographics required, longevity studies, toxicity analysis, etc. required we’re generally required back then. even seen crash videos take car 60s smash modern average car? old car basically turns jagged heap modern passenger like 1 broken bone.

 Heck, phase 3 trials alone 30,000+ participants. Adverse reactions would statistically documented.

I tell real number much higher thought. What's chance may happen Europe, opinion? I'm scared idea another lockdown mean many European countries death America surpassed America daily new cases. doesn’t seem like Americans.. Fucking right? CAN'T FOOTBALL. A) America’s current global position laughingstock, 

B) Americans currently flailing sea viral incompetence, current administration. 

Note: half-American, half-Irish. NYC? thus teach remotely wearing PPE making impossible heard/understood. inconveniences them. Oh, argument. I’m Germany frequently (well, year, normally...) make husband speak German we’re together. speak English something quietly. Thanks part problem! See? Even commenters thread living retarded fantasy land. makes think earning minimum wage? guy steal identity file taxes 2 years. years made 50k+ taxes meat plant Iowa.

We going enslaved intelligent monkeys. brit living working Beijing right now, believe it. longer required wear masks outside, worried COVID infection. hope people take vein intended, instead misreading big news vaccines needed.

He's espousing targeted vaccinations ringfence outbreaks ensure can't spread. would expect vaccine 100% causes long term immunity, least next 10 years so, aim vaccinate everyone slow time, ensure new outbreaks minimal.

COVID-19 likely never going eradicated, targeted vaccine roll-out remove need restrictions short term, vaccine supply established. Eventually, everyone \*should\* vaccinated. 

Most places need \*everyone\* vaccinated immediately significant effect.

Unfortunately, one place true, United States America... Deserves locked portable toilet set fire. Saw Harley riders parking lot today. Gave wide, masked berth. next month plan shunning since plague source. way treat MAGA hat wearers. That’s dope cares much head start need give them?  Support isn’t right word. like expecting. don’t think country legit outbreaks sustainably lockdown long term. think/hope vaccine come don’t expect lockdowns last then. 

I think certain amount immunity along mask wearing may enough prevent growth transmission. Like we’ve seen places like New York Sweden. It’s interesting Sweden isn’t rise cases rest Europe is. won’t know strategy better, don’t want spread, suspect end ones let happen ones tried tried stop equally worse off.  Why? point prove reddit? people need care residents inside china. even know they/OP bother report daily? $$$$ bottles whatever else threw live problem? don’t believe it, it’s oddly specific stupid thing people frequently enough need kind solution. like way think, though.

When cold hits I'm bringing humidifier help add humidity bring little droplets ground faster. 

Can't much can. personally injected them. placebo. always makes chuckle hear this. Pfizer start-up, they’re monster industry poses challenges, far impossible. already thought procedures put place.  law mandate think “taking people’s free away”?

What law/mandate people unable break? Murder law people still able it. Americans proven time time incredibly selfish lot collectively nation (source: American). become cultural thing us past couple decades particular. buddy farmer, wife's brother works meat plant. day coworker said feel good, helped car. Ended getting covid test next day died home. Test came back positive. fuck around shit, wear mask. I’d love hear reasons. go eat, it’s outdoors 6+ feet tables, servers wear masks, indoor movement like going bathroom requires mask on. risks setup introduce? Wisconsin less 1/3 number people wonder how's pewdiepie days. 我就喜欢这种被人又酸又恨又无奈的感觉 literally way telling got placebo unless trial. Yea bet documented cases beginning way off. Either way though saw Michigan numbers way ramping lately. look like second wave coming know takes time know full effect. plenty people personally know 3 countries following guidelines.

Egocentric behavior human trait. 
There factors come play decide consequences behavior limit much behavior indulged different locales. trait appears universal. also reason Americans shitty rep overseas. disgusting failure macro level different thing isolated event this. 

I’d argue stupid, awful, selfish people world  boomer. considering implications wrong think we're going need little ""seems obvious"" masks break facial recognition technology, yet refuse wear them. pro-fascist death cult point. already anti-vaxxer problem. 

Undermining faith public health authorities (including agencies sabotaged curry favor cost public trust) isn’t helping. Ah, classic slippery slope fallacy. Never change.  population 14 million fuck big deal? may faulty, practically useless Gerrymandering huge issue state legislature US House Representatives. Supreme Court statewide race, Gerrymandering impacts discouraging liberals voting areas uncompetitive races.

The fact Wisconsin close state saw massive conservative swing Obama elected. happened Republicans took full advantage majorities judiciary legislature well governorship gerrymander hell place.  Positive tests doubled past two weeks (1295 3050). overall testing capacity increasing 6-10% week indicates sharp rise positivity. Usa #1!!! 🏈🎆🇲🇾 They’ve completely shut 6 months. Short term done passed. Marietta/Smyrna close Cummings. Costco way. Every store I've suggests masks entrance completely lax inside. Also, racists keep attacking Asian restaurants. Classes probably open registration within next week two decision calendar changes must made students know start end dates classes. know school opened spring registration today we've already made spring scheduling decisions.

How explain Pakistani hospitals mostly empty nowadays whereas two months, completely stacked patients recommended self-isolate home literally space? explain number funerals conducted average peaked June/July since returned normal rate? 

I'll frank you.. Many (including myself) surprised effectively government able fight first wave maybe there's luck skill is. Alhumdullilah handled that's fact.

EDIT: could probably R well 1.00 right now, current social distancing restrictions, everyone wore fucking mask public. us Americans can’t nice things. Sorry applies people coming Canada US cross via Land Air . travel US still need isolate 14 days return places. 

So. Canadians Fly US but, unless things changed, covered third party health insurance plans Canada travel advisories quarentine return. really appreciate contempt nice well dressed folk towards poor. Benford's law method check data manipulated statistics. report made April, US country checked against. Throw book her, throw AWAY key cell. think depends peak, generally agree. Caveat peak high counts. Deal 2 months, open.

Probably could protect vulnerable populations too. Michigan poorly though hope laws stay safe. Trump deepfake. data indicates that, average, no, young people don’t suffer go icu covid large numbers.

This data says. Spring seems optimistic, unrealistic. I'd shoot summer, chances are, restrictions gone (with exceptions light social distancing measures mask requirement). One metric representative work conditions(Japan US here.... cmon lol)

And already said 20 countries US military ensures democratic freedom trade for. Surprise surprise brand new democracies pay protect little better temporarily. Seems like dare you. Cheese done nothing made fat clog arteries First off, you? Super Hotspot low case area. Sounds like going beyond testing isolating make sure ok.

This thing going involve lot risk mitigation, personally sounds like mitigating best can. zero risk? No, I'm sure anything really still interact world all. area shot load covid, maybe hold off. area moderate low cases yeah, precautions. Michigan 10th deaths ramping 2nd wave. doesnt seem like good leadership something brag about....quite opposite. Uh, deaths surged back 1k day US back like July. Ain’t shit gotten less deadly. ""tourism travelling"" curbed, limited, heck, stopped pandemic.

Do think Johnny Joe, spent hundreds, thousands holiday would _not_ go? lose money/vacation it? happening. He'll go hope best.

Oh, Johnny Joe suddenly feeling sick holiday? But... paid it! He's going lose holiday excursion/night he's sick... He's going ""ruin"" holiday he's feeling little bit weather... He'll chin go!

Meanwhile though, ""ruining holiday"", ""night out"" ""he can"" exactly selfish point. ""normal"" situation maybe he's home town he's feeling slightly sick, might stay in.

If suddenly put ""holiday"" situation, over.
Do think they're going talk authorities _another_ country (which they'll X days) sick, potential ruining holiday, stay quarantine bag stigma/unknown come?
No thanks - enjoy holiday done it.

You started chain infection take months end, infecting hundreds? care.. country, town, people problem....

How people holiday live ""normally"" moment beyond me...  Fuuuuck next year half gonna complete dog shit. hope lose mail-in ballot Trump. Yes teachers infect other. risk dramatically reduced proper policy, mandatory mask, stay side classroom, touch teacher stuff, remain 6 feet, daily covid symptom checks. 

People stupid valid argument anti covid measures. People always ability dumb ignore safety measures, weather grocery store airplane. depends establishment strictly keep policies measures. 

At end day depends individual covid measures work. teachers really can't avoid infecting interacting one another policy work. Google it...

I’m sure it’s happening elsewhere - sure NYC.  mean, covid shots *exist*. know ones work lol. Since last month doctors appt chronic illness need go to. havent store since feburary. work home, homeschool, groceries delievered Im sure much happen winter hits. But, live lot land dont feel need go about, life truly changed much since began. wash hands, Ive wearing mask public years due illness. changes home schooling longer biweekly shopping. But, live fear bubble. Practice good hygiene, wear mask, social distance, dont go places need. Okay ""hillarybrokethelaw"", glad hear expert opinion Cinderella Jungle Book well-received decent reviews. Beauty Beast bad (except Emma Watson's autotuned singing).

But pretty much downhill there. “But we’re going rows next other, somewhere perfectly safe.”

PERFECTLY safe?? rows people, ""somewhere"" around 1 metre apart, indoors, hours time that's PERFECTLY safe? 

This outrageous thing claim. 

""...you don’t go you’re feeling well. there’s nobody sick environment, risk,” stated.""

Once again, Henry simply refuses acknowledge asymptomatic people. people know they're sick, stay home? how, know least 20% cases asymptomatic, public health official possibly claim ""no risk""? argument piece shit fucking work. Acting aggressive mean win debate, makes people stop debating you. know radical concept. guarantee, Pfizer (and potentially Oxford Moderna) plus project Warp Speed, mass vaccination Feb-Mar 2021 absolutely feasible. Median symptom hospitalization interval occurred 7 days, range 3-9 days. probably past worst 10+ experience living Asia, saw many places besides Japan China.

I agree this, cars driven computers, people, eventually. But, that's possible - nothing preference. meantime, order go work get food, people need (it's preference, necessity), driving car necessary. also could flu transmit grandma store! 

You're right. People \*always\* wearing masks flu season, similar response covid. And, grandma going store flu season. would put case infection ration right around 7:1. Experts thought 10 earlier pandemic, sounds right.

I wonder likely - people idea it, people thinking cold flu last spring. true. got tested visiting grandparents. People get tested traveling. People get tested feel fine briefly came contact someone tested positive. start pandemic tested people symptoms positivity rate like 40% Death preferred government authorized alternative. fucking serious lol Nothing ""stops"" covid. trying mitigate damage causes every step, one way that. rebuttal evidence asked for, evidence regards corruption top US government, look evidence say “well yeah, head government person one leaders response national problem indeed say that, like... ignore it.” Astoundingly ignorant. No, wfh part legit, choice shop home stay home extent are. What? people think rushed vaccine 100% safe? Also saw Thursday evening, one theater. Saw Jurassic Park Sunday evening gf two six total people.  think odds favor... Easy, use Defense Production Act increase manufacture US based N95 masks. 

Wait... [you mean say Trump administration, vast majority mask manufacturing migrated know, Kimberly Clark moved production overseas despite warnings national security risks Trump's insistence keeps manufacturing jobs US. one Trump's ongoing trade war China prevents us getting enough raw material production proper N95 masks, leading streets flooded shitty KN95 masks barely better surgical masks protect wearer, actual life-saving, user-protecting, NIOSH-approved N95 respirators cost $10 secondary market. Gee, would embarrassing everyone realized bad Trump administration - one dismantled pandemic response team crisis - fucked up. Let's draw attention that. cares we're saving many lives could long we're owning libs? say “This going affect credibility American institutions like FDA CDC” — ***it already has***, staggering degree would believed could happen, watched happen.

When first heard back Dec novel respiratory virus blowing China, began paying close attention. waited see signs CDC feds galvanized. waited. January.

Then CDC badly bungled hamstrung testing process, lost faith confidence them. still believed FDA.

Then knuckled like craven toadies. 😣

So I’m Dr Fauci — he’s human: he’s made least one sizeable mistake early mask guidance. didn’t know found later: even homemade cloth masks make big difference. ***he admitted mistake apologized***. He’s done nothing since continue earn deserve respect confidence.

I don’t know US would without him. Thankfully Portland banned use facial recognition. cities follow suit. Southern USA different geographical zone, different weather patterns, follows different viral life cycle.

Compare Southern USA Mexico get similar Everyone thinking sue: carrying knife brandished work *against* company policy, case

Edit: matter reasonable **you** think actions were, company zero tolerance weapon policy, someone sticks gun face, pull firearm, getting fired. I'm sorry shatter many naive fantasies works. Even think unfair, agreed got hired. convoluted Inception, time travel instead sleeping.  worry. They'll probably end closing two weeks second wave arrives. got sometime May. I’m fairly introverted... I’m also good terms myself. started running good distractions (I don’t attention span watch tv play video games), that’s pretty.

Living box brain made for.

Also whole “it’s safe enough go work visit friends” thing frustrating. much feel like cog machine lately dumb? Please specific. Yea, 

We vaccine every child age 1 first year. focus getting least one, preferably several candidates show side effects, measure effectiveness. Based know today might need least doze every year, perhaps multiple ones based effectiveness. 

The vaccine also medicine, effect people already hospitals, solving problem also help us. India best quality control world /s quite incorrect. large percentage people still take seriously, victim confirmation bias still seeing selfish pricks without masks acting like virus hoax. What? believed said fomite major cause spread, spread all. There's reason CDC still tells wash hands. fomite transmission ""all dismissed"" certainly case. Nothing assumes symptoms lifelong even abnormal viral infection. Myocardial inflammation found athletes common cold infection. Looks like you’re using improper statistics hamfisted way attack religion Fox News. already revealed are. Go crawl back fantasy. That's new mentality parroted militaryindustrialeducationsalestaxcomplex machine. One infected person mean automatic quarantine. positive automatically mean ICU stay. worried close school causing outbreak.

This realest thing I've seen today. 10000% true. greedy moronic sociopaths? Ministry Disease Control two theaters since reopening, checked available seats pre-show. One movies went (Jurassic Park) 4 people whole theater, Tenet alone. REALLy easy distance.  Actually use defense production act American companies produce distribute masks instead giving millions dollars son law/ seizing masks way places need order son law resell markup. numbers official stats White House downward adjustment straight CDC conclusions.

Sharing ""spreading panic"" thann acknowledging unavoidable truth infection automatically means already documented consequences.

Perhaps lecture near million dead ""spreading panic."" Maybe need PR firm catch phrase.

""Sit wait"" excellent advice parallel universe president actively lying PLANNING let millions die repeatedly burying reports showing conclusions I'm sharing. Wait days lucky not. Wish best. I've read enough actual crazy comments past 6 months question everything without /s... guess faith u well placed. I’m thinking: running outside, weights gym masks one else around. afford first stimulus. money! covered like 4 weeks ago No, wrote you

Get head fantasy. church blaming epidemic time? 

Grow fuck up. lost compassion you. come secular science sub, stay church. Apparently dramatic can’t read either. It’s okay. 

And yes dramatic believe people won’t social distance wear masks year now. fact it’s dramatic it’s unrealistic 

By means please stay inside next couple years. bearing life long keep sub, what’s issue? definitely think they’re purposely going elsewhere troll that’s issue. it’s staying there? Well people right say stupid shit internet Fuck Rite Aid anyway. They’re using facial recognition software stores (def Cal, Oakland area). refuse give business going forward bolsters decision me. unlikely vaccine prevent people contagious. Keeping getting sick probably best hope short term.

In scenario vaccinate people risk getting seriously ill. Oh believe it. remember paying crazy prices syllabus’s college lot learning rather lectures. wasn’t even pandemic going then. Northeastern University's student video news team covered recent dismissal Westin 11 living situations like N.U. students campus reopened covid guidelines know answer, could places limit number people go ventilation good, we've lucky far. hands restaurants bars, least people packed close together. restriction initially distance tables gone pretty quickly. Personally go traditional gym one go relative big big space people. also keep front door/gate wide open sure helps. Stay room leave Hey idiot, said worse fatality numbers. Nobody talking pretzeling argument percentage population kill off, except weird ass. 400,000 people dead end year. short matter months 675,000 people died COVID-19. dire kill Americans history. pandemic war able claim killed Americans. gross twisting facts can't change that.  Probably? definite risk. I've done ""risky"" stuff though, judgement, kind odd question. hard calculate risk situations many unknowns variables, takes bit unluckiness catch it. would better bodyweight exercises outdoor cardio, must go gym, plan good gets. well see, trying contain virus. dr. Sure hell would never say “what wrong you?” Lol. fact think saying someone decision made know nothing says everything 'Santiago received call human resources employee, informed let go two reasons. first one supposed enforce statewide mask mandate, second knife violated company’s no-tolerance weapons policy.' 14% would estimate world average. I'll believe USA average metric :( Except joking course seems quite often. contingency people sub can't come terms thought sweden might dangerous, less-than-exemplary solution crisis might wait little longer happy meals. Part depends many active cases area. Yes, you’re area active cases, maybe odds low getting bars. doesn’t seem case many places, that’s bars many places still closed restricted capacity/seating. Nah Low key, I’m finding hard care anymore. still wear mask course I’ve noticed sometimes slack hand washing thoroughness remembering sanitize/wash food etc etc

It feels like matter number going keep going one else cares it’s unavoidable leave bag pretzels open half eaten throughout flight. FA walks by, take pretzel put mouth. Works every time. Rt simply tell whole story. Even single, localized outbreak superspreader event massively impact Rt. one person sick one person infects six people, Rt 6.0. evaluate bad situation given state, need understand Rt, also absolute number cases. high Rt manageable short run long many people sick begin with. Smaller states like Vermont Alaska often see issue. one lockdown days. Israel go lockdown, it. couple days

It ""couple days"" societally supportive reason so.

I'm sorry bullshit. live one states getting slammed time recommendation helped disease spread unchecked. government employee lying public acceptable. ESPECIALLY kills people. guilty manslaughter. 

Fauci put family lives greater danger that's opposite job. Personally I'll still wear one possible even vaccine virus slowly disappears pandemic status. may wear one future I'm sick common illness (cold, sore throat etc.) avoid infecting others. engage actual practically unpaid labor prison populations USA. Money goes warden's pocket. see plenty people know different countries stating never wear masks I'd say anti-mask protests kind speak themselves. tracing, many countries joke. someone needs travel 100% work pisses off, every country seriously implemented things I'd back work now.  removing comment expect also remove comments replied thread simply continuing flow. downvotes potentially reported someone simply readers thinking I'm pro-police/anti protest/anti party presume. simply understand mechanism, push price up, cash in, earning sell also buying cheap. Watch Big short lol agree point ton caveats there. vaccine passes approval process (Health Canada won’t necessarily approve one right away, fully expect there’ll lag approval say US vs home). Availability, efficacy, etc. 

Plus we’re hedging bets, let’s say 2 4 pass approval; number lot lower. there’s also idea we’ll building domestic stockpile own.

At end day, donations countries might much smaller think. Imagine huge rural areas virus free. lol could secured PPEs told public wear home made face coverings (as stopped lying putting people's lives danger). Telling people least wear shirt coffee filter would saved lives made big difference long term outcome slowing spread earlier. 

Maybe ok life risked lying public servant, I""m not. state one first hit, going around rampant lying. got Heathrow international transport hub. losing 1,000 people day this, little done national level, president outright says he’s playing holding maskless rallies calling protests.

It’s destroying little done. didn;t checks resort? problem: epidemiologists public health experts understand supply chains, economics civil liberties.

At moment, lorry crosses Channel either chain tunnel ferry. point give load British driver. can't France British driver go quarantine France unlikely agree build massive lorry park result British policy. Therefore option come UK, drop load British driver leave. can't use lorry driver going hang around (potentially days) need cab delivery products mainland Europe, hence need massive lorry park. company announced asymptomatic employee tested positive. claimed contact tracing notified anyone potentially came contact them, specialists come disinfect entire office weekend everyone come Monday like usual. also claim person wore mask times highly doubt that.

In theory followed protocol know, others touched coffee pot, door handle, papers, knows else touched it, I'm terrified going spread office like wildfire they're ignoring many employees' concerns wanting work home. worried be, anything put mind ease? (Aside obvious measures like handwashing, face masks, etc) stayed outside live action version? Firstly, idea linked licence clearly rubbish. going avoid done killing someone drunk-driving got licence.

Secondly, exactly gross negligence applies manner different scenarios. builder negligently lobbing bricks scaffold going done manslaughter one kills someone, even slightest intent injure anyone. Similarly, landlord failing maintain gas fire results someone dying carbon monoxide poisoning likely face charges. Even Australia extent. every new case Victoria Queensland extensive contact tracing done published. especially great Victoria, one point 500 cases day. 哈哈 lot area people think infection possible maybe. wrong, waking find fingers black mummified also particular kind horror. fine church closed comply. pastor think rule apply sure go hell. Except ignorance masks worked led say wear them. one thing argument ""Masks protect besides medical workers need protect themselves."" internally contradictory. Plus, countries recommending general mask use already. No, LIE, Fauci admitted it:

[When asked weren’t told wear masks beginning? Dr. Fauci responded saying:
“Well, reason concerned public health community, many people saying this, concerned time personal protective equipment, including N95 masks surgical masks, short supply. wanted make sure people namely, health care workers, brave enough put harm way, take care people know infected coronavirus danger getting critical early days this, spreading rapidly killing people (inluding state), lied. ""was going best science time"", lied. Now, agree getting PPEs medical workers. secured PPEs told public least wear something. shirt coffee filter could saved lives without depriving medical workers. exponential growth early days, reduction rate transmission would huge effect subsequent numbers. Fauci lied people died. Maybe ok that, I""m not. know release films ""at home release"" $30 something. films that. Still cheaper taking family theater. That's necessarily true, lot air recirculated inside. case, UV could helpful, simple adding UV lights. live Maine (for whole live minus 3 years grad school) definitely tell difference accents going New Brunswick. slight, there. Yeah, I'm willing bet ancient HVAC systems going start failing soon. people Americans UK Facebook group really defensive it, I've *specifically* used threat articles like warning people considering breaking quarantine returning trips visit families. Like, worried Americans viewed negatively, really want risk ""local outbreak traced back American broke quarantine procedure"" splashed news center it?  may misunderstood superintendent claimed meeting, sounded like saying would 100% fresh air rooms 6 times hour. maybe said 6 air changes left ""100% OA"" part. school teach in, units ancient replaced years ago, honestly can't imagine they're going able change air every 10 minutes. unit classroom breaks week average. 

Our union asked upgrading HEPA filters superintendent responded possible systems. mean sure harsh punishment, natural consequence. won’t this, need this. live island Eastern Canada haven’t outbreak two cases months wear mask every day, four year old daughter. life now. Truly mask wearing getting easier. saw nurse Covid testing yesterday. many layers on. wear cloth face covering hey?! People throw paper towels customer toilet office. unclog twice week.

Or, that's would tell want honest regard decorum. that's truth.  Even suffered depression first time. Three months hell Should’ve stayed Germany. travel train pandemic? Austria’s spiking. Nah... haven’t even finished first wave yet... second peak, resurgence, second wave. However, I’ll accept using correct terminology rather less important grasping seriousness situation. We'll see. gut tells going another contested election.  lockdown How? live US I’m South Korean works exclusively Canadian clients. clear difference accents Vancouver Toronto compared Americans Cali state.

I feel like you’re talking ass without even hearing accents. covid infection leads acquired immunodeficiency syndrome one optional payed, big enough difference? 

I mean defend *Indonesia's* specific implementation community service. framing entirely American.

I saying US this, treated different forms community service here. Could get board would actually fine community service paid prisoners

Are saying America implements community slavery

I could assign morally-loaded term prisons, too: detention centers. ""No human detained will."" think would agree that. many cases individuals need separated society — forfeited certain rights violating others. That's laws governments work, better worse.

In fact, community service US always ""optional"" sense required law (not flogged do). mean, could always *refuse* — ""optional"" sense. another violation law hands. choice criminal.

I'm that, one least controversial opinions US penal system.

If want legal penal system reform, get behind 100%. community service better, redemptive, humane punishment forced sit alone room hours day decades life. Criminals choice refuse it. I’d hope leave also aerosols linger inside car pop customers get in. shout defund police soon arrest anti lockdown protesters brutalise loved. hear cries defunding Australian police image shown airway; coronavirus virons red ones.

If believe hard enough.  rural MN first several months hated going grocery store often one people wearing masks I'd get stink eye every then. Ever since statewide mask update I've felt lot confident going I'm longer outlier.

Anti-mask goddamn fucking stupid. cost lives depresses economy many want go out. want people buying shit local businesses well save lives? Mandate masks. Simple that. South refers countries india, sri lanka, nepal. Southeast refers countries singapore Philippines. see anything wrong. point what's wrong? surprise; deaths lag three weeks more.

Best luck slavery form penal labor norm US. think thats implied 74m number OP used. population around 37 million.  Everyone flipped shit predicted end times Disney Universal reopened, corresponding spike cases, nobody wants admit wrong. Fir extroverts, brutal. 

(I’m introvert, it’s beginning get me.) Come better kidding right? paid like everyone else world provides labour enable various rights enjoy. see mean, say ""consistently"", I’m thinking relative I’m hearing friends family countries. Mask-wearing compliance Singapore charts compared places think, think people wouldn’t try go without mask even without fines would difficult much. 3 big holidays yes. it’s people time shop.

They picked 3 weeks businesses closed anyway holiday easier. Hong Kong health minister said needed least [5 million people tested end third got third that.  Two words... ""Viral Load"" Border closed.

Sentinel seems struggling keeping pace.... Ikr, people weird. talking mught good idea seperate people think covid isnt problem logical people, dont infect anyone needlessly says, reddit.

All social media designed gain attention keep it. care seeing true false. 

All platforms destructive. YouTube, twitter, reddit, instagram. soma, two minutes hate. They're watch us control us. 

And willingly. Could inhaled vaccine administered home, training required? would good option vaccinations necessary yearly--getting entire population country come vaccination appointment every year would mammoth logistical task, could something like would lessen burden. Stupidity Everything needs cancelled virus eradicated. mean difficult decision? one hand human lives, other, economy. psychopaths would chose economy. Unfortunately country psychopaths anywhere else world worst place ever. Going forward press-briefings going Tuesday Thursday, Wednesday Friday website updates. websites gather data regional websites data updated regularly, might also asyncronicities, since regions sometimes report data using different criteria FHM - platz.se covidstatistik.se one example.

P.S. suspect might return daily reports another large cases/hospitalizations/deaths increase March, hope necessary. Texas small town hospital. Pretty limited supplies PPE.  Imagine sorts bio-terrorists spent rest life jail cell. Maybe penalties spreading virus causing thousands deaths matched that, would much less superspreaders. Ok, source? Moderna Inc MRNA.O asking sites conducting clinical trials experimental coronavirus vaccine focus enrolling at-risk minorities, even slows trial speed

 Already Shows intelligence doesnt it?

Skid stupid life dude. :) Schools deny equal education opportunities children want take guns school too. sue that? way see it, I'd rather vaccine two phases safety trials already serious side effects coronavirus significantly higher chance serious side effects. IMO public rollout right without waiting see works, since they've already proven can't make things worse. can't make sense simple comment, everyone else can, problem likely English comprehension skills

That aside, clearly attempt squirm ridiculous argument lmao scientific study people enrolled in.

They randomly sampled blood donations. listed two factors suggest number low (posted elsewhere comments). put standing position strapped board sitting like 30% angle something? Hehe digging graves.

Nice Uh yeah former server here. worked place nine years restaurant phase one went affect called back. texted gm said “nobody(customers) wearing masks it’s incredibly unsafe. “ refused go back. I’ve heard since customers wear masks go restroom servers wear set food right front laughing, coughing customers maskless. raises risk 70% chance catching virus. 
A former co worker said accosted customer asked mask walk around. They’re splitting tips bar tenders servers money isn’t worth even. Fuck that. Time reassess server situation awhile. I’m American lives close border always tell who’s Canadian; treat service people waitstaff like shit; foundation always two shades orange skin; fond dark red hair dye; drive like psychopaths visit small town large Canadian city; think they’re European cultured speak French. know fuckers understand English y’all don’t need dicks French thing. town bliss since border closed. bad we’ll go toilet soon without Canadian cash coming tho. want much believe realistically wait we're drowned articles reports it, rather couple sporadic mentions Monday morning.

Being optimistic / anti-gloom good, I'm happy hop hype train. let told good news, discovering market-driven useless rumors, good. Unfortunately country caveats mean parents send kids back school Wisconsin one states dumb-dumbs congregate. Austin holding well, still way many Karens going way make scene wear mask. assholes like Karen, mask YEARS vaccine comes out(sketchy best) Would true HEPA air filter anything covid? one room separate entrance house would normally tutoring, currently operating remotely. Pressure mounting go back person, though, hit idea. 

But theatre, waste money. Approved released ones? No. (Well, beyond things like allergic reactions) Theres voluntary recalls due concerns contamination concerns such, I'm aware adverse reactions actually occurring.

I'm reasonably sure there's vaccines development scrapped due adverse findings, that's routine occurence drug development. usually found preliminary testing animals, before. us Tennessee idiots, yes, fair share them. quite honest fan UV general (my field biosafety disinfection big topic). UV frankly, good does. It’s can’t work, rather many complicating variables (contact time, distance, life bulb, shadows cast, *dust* bulb, etc.) it’s difficult verify it’s job, especially air handler. doesn’t harm I’ve heard improve life MERV filter, find idea it’s inactivating virus whizzes HVAC bit dubious. Based hard he's working, I'd say 5 cents post. Probably testing inconsistent  truth. also know great working conditions, imagine one Serb calling boss got back Greece tell fever? would fired imediatelly, take Tylol hot mask fever. copying there. doomed, example. chance. No, government forcefully restrict opening. That’s enforcement is. enforcement law doesn’t mean anything government doesn’t actually power. usually doesn’t come point always implied generally keeps people line.

If small fine restaurants would choose stay open. large fine point restaurant could afford operate, would argue also restriction free will.

Restricting free isn’t limited physically strapping someone can’t anything. view point American would seriously question whether understand country founded on. “We also need set realistic expectations possibility vaccination eliminate COVID-19. Physical distancing, hand hygiene, improved ventilation indoor settings, indoor mask use part daily routines, us time. new normal continue living principles keep community rates low possible”

Most people know aren’t social distancing right now, makes think anyone keep distancing potentially years? Remember months ago people said thing spike cases south? deaths inevitably shot later guys disappeared while?

You’re right one thing. Peoples response’s studied decades. Well need live fear respect. 3,00,000 people die year U.S. living fear based causes death ? deaths usually delayed 2 3 weeks virus take pretty long finally kill someone. so.... :/ posing question thought expecting actual answer. know Pfizer's CEO said think real possibility enough data submit FDA approval end October. would assume includes enough safety data FDA make decision EUA. They're probably worried accent English itself... order “save” many elderly, isolated. visitors, senior centers activities closed. everyone stay 6 feet away physical contact unless person basically hazmat suit. meeting gang coffee, indoor recreation activities closed many months , least live. access libraries get computer pick book. Many still independent older people live alone, “family bubble”. I’m sure many wondering what’s point “saved” short years left. mental impact long term isolation world considerable. possible upgrade units designed low class filters HEPA filters. fans strong enough overcome pressure. replace unit whole. Dining restaurants also linked keeping business getting employees paychecks. seeing want see - totalitarian backwards China, care people. facts mounting evidence clear day, China managed outbreak remarkably well country large population well way economic recovery. go work every day see hundreds thousands shanghaiers happily going day, without worry spectre COVID 19 government controlled virus effectively using pragmatic policy aided modern technology. Potemkin village, refusal believe belies biases. Yep, probably fair bit higher 5x. take account, article says, two factors:

1. “First, antibody levels decline rapidly may disappeared people time testing.”

2. “Second, blood donors general health-conscious healthier general population” so? way tell genuine sequencing virus. could reactivation otherwise.  treatments e coli tests 

What’s treatment Covid Ah old mental health argument. Tell many people died pandemic? doesn’t compare people dying Covid-19 There's thing called SEC oversees kind things. illegal. 

Also, positively affecting stock value short-term absolutely useless. literally serves purpose company, practice daily trading speculation. anything, ""lying"" affects stock value negatively. issue well governor made mandatory rule added $500 fine. However, police won’t enforce called unless someone harassing employee. help lot though.l one shit town wearing one do. suggesting keep paying employees closed business months? weird logic think that's business' responsibility government's. know pay taxes employer contributes unemployment insurance reason right? government's job make sure still survive work, employer, already part. 



""Oh unemployment shit pay even rent!"" Elect stupid people, get stupid systems place. USA manages shitty safety net rich country. Would putting fans windows obstruct air flow little bit? way putting fans? going affect credibility American institutions like FDA CDC. fact, taking whatever coming FDA CDC grain salt. European FDA CDC equivalents saying thing are, would go Europeans. hesitancy making types decisions, pretty sure know march look like... rest us spread easily makes people risk best get it.

Sorry needed vote better government would give money survive. 

Anyways nobody ever died bad economy. Coronavirus hand... fuck off, we're full Thank you, too.  Two bourbons deep non-work night crap times, think something want read properly tomorrow. 20% long term symptoms? Given desire push herd immunity happens 20 percent infected long haulers? really going accuse OP using rhetoric disguise comparing community service Holocaust?? 

The incredibly obvious distinction community service slavery Holocaust community service warranted, proportionate, (in case) relevant crime. can't believe actually explain community service genocide, jesus christ tell hospital chief. Well tell Mississippi schools good job preventing spread. even going far report total active cases parents. 

DeSoto county schools report cases every Monday previous week. put spread sheet online showing total week delete previous week page keep people adding total numbers.

But that's shitty distinction outdoor activities curtailed. excerpt

Evidence UK’s higher overall death toll first wave pandemic relative comparable countries unequivocal. England highest excess all-cause mortality rate among 23 European countries first five months 2020 compared 2015-19, followed Spain Scotland, mortality spread throughout country contrast localised patterns England also second (after Spain) highest peak excess all-cause mortality slowest fall normal levels—so longest period excess deaths. contrasts Norway, Finland, Denmark, Austria, eastern European countries, excess mortality observed throughout 2020, even sharper.

and dumb, look around people 40s north doing. “We know results could underestimate true seroprevalence two reasons,” states Professor Catherine Hankins, CITF Co-Chair. “First, antibody levels decline rapidly may disappeared people time testing. Second, blood donors general health-conscious healthier general population,” continues. “Nonetheless, results tell us Canadians infected SARS-CoV-2 end May. shows actors, especially individual citizens, follow good public health practices, risk infection diminishes considerably,” adds.

This YouTube video I've ever shared make fun conspiracy theorists rely YT, something accurately responsibly details data argument, worth sharing. agree punishment too.

However, usually type 'hard labour' punishment brought option, meets resistance people saying things like ""cruel unusual"" UN treaty human rights / slavery.

Frankly, I'd happily sentence hard crimes to... example, ""make 80 tonnes 20mm graded gravel granite cliff face""- pick shovel. Let spell then:

Singapore population 6M, similar metro areas cities like Atlanta, Philadelphia, Miami. people Atlanta, Philadelphia, Miami, stay within metro areas nearly time. contacts inherently harder trace, least, reasons related size city. fact sufficient vitamin levels makes less likely become ill encounter sars-cov-2 also fact vitamin ""hammer"", severely ill people (those showing hospital severe Covid-19 symptoms), treatment, greatly lower number deaths (university hospital Spain released study recently numbers astonishing).

&amp;#x200B;

Some doctors US talking benefits vitamin since years: nobody listening them. certainly politicians big pharma.

&amp;#x200B;

What going various government's response that? Many governments seem interested keeping people fear, check, home, pushing cheap, public domain, readily available, medicine that'd help people die less get less often sick.

&amp;#x200B;

In Europe particularly bad: media keep talking ""infections rise"" since weeks weeks deaths seen anymore. goal obviously induce fear: end, idea.

&amp;#x200B;

At point surprised media started running piece abuse vitamin highly dangerous governments started outlaw sale vitamin supplements.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope point doctors shall see light, honor pledge start prescribing vitamin anyone calling mild symptoms, instead following orders governments basically ""let people get insanely sick home without prescribing anything, send hospital they're severely ill"".

&amp;#x200B;

P.S: 500 people analyzed, results statistically significant open discussion. Although interest keeping people sick fear shall certainly find angle attack studies vitamin D.

Sweden fine. High risk families forced put kids school threat kids taken away. Doctors care workers fired wearing masks.

Sweden fine. cousin's son turned four knows wear mask. cool superhero one. saw wearing plain mask tried offer one extra masks. treat masks like cool new piece clothing wear kids adjust quickly. country hung teachers dry, average American blame it.

Politicians every level nothing properly fund schools prepare this. already underfunded, needed billions start pandemic work improving airflow, sanitation, ramping PPE.

Nothing done, time came go back school teachers reluctant. many selfish, narrow minded Americans pointed said 'get back work', overlooking dangers faced posed community large. Schools superspreaders - they're unsafe they're open, nobody safe.

It's damn shame, one blame ourselves. Even retrofit schools compliant ventilation objectives, could done something - portable air filters every room. places - \*nothing\*, simply funding get much anything done.

When someone tells important education reopening schools, remind money talks bullshit walks - little money actually spent education order reopen safely. Unfortunately virus probably never going away. It’ll become endemic. They've smallest percentage increase they're absolutely massive company COVID vaccine, whether works not, going make break company. Shit, argue successful vaccine valuable advertising actual returns. plural anectode data. theory could extinction level near extinction level event Opening theaters without tent pole movies like opening circus without tent poles. They're concerned convenience others' safety. Selfishness. That’s lot assumptions. vaccine year end thoroughly tested. What’s wrong waiting continue social distance, stay home, wear mask?

Nah, I'm defunding Fox News. 700+ cases day peak roughly 50 moment (and trending downwards) Melbourne. Thank taking time explain! 

Please consider sharing knowledge wider audience somehow... Maybe AMA? Write article (it’s easy publish Medium)? people start buying masks would've gone medical personnel.

In hindsight stupid, they've corrected thwir mistake. problem us people still followed original statement backfired government Normal accurate thing national lockdown US makes absolutely sense due size country. vaccine available shipped market! hey instead wall build ditch mean, says professor security studies

Not sure became news. It’s different redditor shitty napkin math saying researched thoroughly Yes, please work!!! never saw bored surfing internet day home nothing else focus several months

You know like Chinese, man. built hospital 10 days, sent basically every medical personnel Wuhan Chinese people around world sent PPE Wuhan. HEPA filters filter viruses size SARS-V-2 (it almost nothing pore size electrostatic attraction). However HEPA filters also much bigger energy drain based cost/benefit don’t think they’re much use widespread. one thing, data I’ve seen gives little indication virus capable spreading one isolated room section building another ventilation, airflow *within* rooms capable spreading it. Single-pass airflow natural ventilation combination source control (masking testing) imo pays benefit trying install HEPA filters everywhere. even easier that. need wear mask. That's it. Washing food, bad idea, needed order avoid COVID-19. manage contain it/fight it?

It's like they've shy this. Full lockdowns, universal masking, forced quarantines, invasive technology assisted contact tracing, best medical manufacturing supply chain world, massive testing capacity, mature civil surveillance state w/ compliant population. disagree hive mind long term sub 2 years. made $17k year. NM also. I’m proud governor. great job controlling pandemic state. helps low population though. People get sick, yes. stay home I'm sick, you. Paid sick leave mandatory. People come work can't afford stay home. I'm tired developing bronchitis 2-3 week cough/respiratory symptoms cold. I'm hoping pandemic make people wear masks they're sick, stay away people, etc. stop spreading nasty germs around. Literally Sorry hear man. 

I'm Melbourne, Australia we've lockdown 10 weeks now. 

We reopening covid normal way new cases 28 days (there easing case numbers fall though)  record worked Applebee's college little microwaved. way overhyped. Mostly veggie sides stuff. Man, guys really want provide Fox News content, you? choose ignorance personal beliefs reality. Exposure reality disease good them. least performing necessary service community without risking essential personnel. mean else supposed get Travis Scott Burger? go public. pandemic. place people constantly remove ppe eat. 

What expect happen? People like problem America. want make last long possible wont care lives lost. link total garbage. even say came back positive. ""think"" superspreader focus works Germany. link reeks xenophobia eating up??? Sorry, meant coteacher asshole! needs wear ear plugs help keep everyone safer, complain sound blinds moving, pandemic. Sorry work jerk 2 spain... Naval base Rota Cadiz air base Madrid. would think banning sick working would make sense number industries, example anything food service, dealing public, occupations can’t avoid near people like person office meetings. safely work remote, you’re good go. think positions rules wouldn’t work (ex. Business owners, CEO’s), pretty much anyone works hourly majority workers able accommodate this. proof work countries already made work neccessarily all. scare, get vaccine.  they're trying to. selfish agendas CCP cancer world. managed get pandemic control region. Painting someone completely evil worth listening single thing like saying Von Braun rockets work he's Nazi. ??? Quite easy keep lid on? nuts? U.S. tens thousands new identified cases COVID-19 every day! We're track worse fatality numbers Flu pandemic 1918. Tryna get stock price think big part issue never really flattened curve. past months &lt;10k opposed would really able open. Plus lower cases contact trace... Use tools.

We fucking hate covid though. united Nothing would make happier seeing viable, safe vaccine end year point, I'll believe see headline ""Vaccine available shipped market"". Makes ashamed millennial. Fair enough, they'll accept longer lockdown contain Dalian Urumqi outbreak, tested much full population test went back test risk part population second time good measure.

Or take another example: China much test capacity afford run tests imported frozen food. really difficult understand caring. traditional high risk, likely long-term effects most. get reporting great, know enough know need get sick, go know need reduce chances get sick. Hearing awful stuff commits keep loved ones safe. 

I get want things go back normal. desperately want that, too. best way get back normal take care keep people healthy. means limiting unnecessary interactions. say takes hundred copies virus make sick. (Earlier reports saying ~1000. Ebola takes 1 you’re unlucky, binds right cell reproduces.) 

And one (large) droplet contain several thousand virus copies. larger droplets normally fall ground fast don’t stay suspended air, yeah, get unlucky cough one (or yelling/singing visible nasty “say don’t spray it” sized droplets go flying) inhale it, could wrote.

The MUCH numerous smaller droplets caused speaking normal volumes won’t contain many copies, one thing read duration airborne droplets something like ~35% chance 50um droplet started least one virus copy average infectious person, super-spreaders expelling something like 250 times much virus.


Edit: one airborne duration: good right.

You're bad English math. mistaking word 'right' word ""delusional"".  actually true. symptomatic quarantine, laws requiring quarantine unless tested positive.

Unfortunately, leads question common sense mitigation measure? people refuse wear masks since see common sense. short, tried common sense mitigation measures first reopening (I'm California), enough people complied, spiked lock prevent overwhelming hospitals.

All lockdowns prolong pain, people agree behave open back up, we're stuck (or unacceptable levels death - current levels acceptable). lockdowns initiated common-sense mitigations fail - usually due non-compliance.

The first lockdown area necessary measure buy time implementing longer term solution - sane mitigations refer to. place (in businesses public, well communications guidelines), infection rate acceptable level declining, reopening begin. everybody follows guidelines, stay open reasonable restrictions (as Germany now). lockdowns necessary (though maybe individual towns communities flare up). significant number people ignore even defy precautions, case count climbs back started first lockdown, thus need lock again.

Sure, could let risk-takers society ""super-cautious"" stay home, except essential workers (and mean medical professionals, public transportation, people maintaining critical supporting infrastructure like utilities) still need work. stay home, society may collapse, pretty. forced go public people actively dangerous refuse follow even basic guidelines. So, put cautious folks risk risk takers inconvenienced, inconvenience risk takers cautious reasonably safe. say cautious, mean paranoid ""super-cautious"", mean normal people want catch deadly disease - i.e. majority population.

Tattoo inside eyelids. Perhaps talking California specifically, can't really argue live know specifics strategy. 

But speaking general, ""flatten curve"" closest thing national strategy ever got, still probably biggest goal. get downvoted shit constantly sub pointing out, we've absolutely succeeded goal. curve flat speak. Hospitals overwhelmed. national level, we've exponential spread happen exactly two times - March early April, June/July. times, got lid halted increase. times, hospitals hard-hit areas start get overwhelmed, times pretty decisively pulled back brink. flattening curve, it. That's fact, regardless may feel US response.

However, time consider we've learned lot past 6 months since ""flatten curve"" became thing. One biggest things we've learned quickly sneakily virus explode population starting point looked promising. We've seen clearly demonstrated across world we've seen demonstrated country various states made appeared prudent decision reopen May got absolutely slammed (such FL AZ). understanding what's necessary able reopen things changed. we've seen badly curve ""un-flatten"" careless. shut reopen shut reopen shut help anybody. probably worst possible approach. Perhaps missed point, Australia, every country earth far I'm aware, people must abide duly enacted laws.
It matter Australia, China anywhere else, laws laws must respected.
Australia democracy self evident laws accepted public large, minorities simply option right disobey laws disagree with, yes, absurd scenario describe minority must obey law.
I point point groups larger 6 people permitted assemble UK, probably seen another totalitarian state according twisted logic people Reddit. Taking drive never virus risk. 

Driving around often means stopping gas often. Gas stations single point many people gather. touch things. Also driving comes repairs maintenance requires getting vehicle serviced introducing opportunities virus caught and/or spread. Limiting travel help prevent spread virus. people working site never stopped working.

It tragic many people forced unsafe conditions. I'm extremely fortunate I'm able work home. one expecting people give jobs stay home. anyone ever asked people take steps can. forced work, wear mask, keep distance etc. idea limit non-essential travel. Going work option working home *is* essential travel. self-righteousness spreading, maybe order shit online, still equals people forced risk spread virus often inessential consumerism

There's self-righteousness here. everyone could prevent limit spread virus we'd much better off. Unfortunatly still large number people feel hoax, worse flu, bad people 60, masks make sick, 5G spreads virus, everyone without underlying condition trying catch it, protecting others limiting spread virus important whatever want. maybe order shit online, still equals people forced risk spread virus

Yes, people grocery stores still work. order groceries week one employees collect deliver it. went store shopping would two people risking infection instead one. better. can't eliminate risk, try limit much possible. Ordering online great way people that, better we'd be.   able secure food independently this,

I agree shown major problems essential services handled. parents started gardening year grow veggies. I've got small network friends try get things there's something one us struggling find. I'm lucky enough two stores deliver me. people able get even one. even read article? assuming headline it’s anti-mask? Ffs, 2024 expecting serving aboard USS Enterprise, healing shit tricorders using holodeck instead youporn. news item major set back 😔 Thank god. Yes, due economic collapse places already risk getting worse.

The number deaths covid nothing compared numbers.  time Europe, Canada others approved drug one FDA evaluator simply refused allow concerns use pregnant women.

And US Thalydomide babies. Sorry, world pandemic related US election? France, masks compulsory public transport shops, bus driver beaten death telling group put masks entering bus; nurse, returning work, beat telling someone put mask; guy bashed baseball bats telling someone put mask laundry mat. know else impedes development?

Death. it’s bad possibly could b

be realistic want opinion taken seriously realize acting self interest say claiming know people think (instead confronting reality going pandemic could viewed negative too)? certain people mad go first place they're jealous what, popular things do?

You clue people thinking, try act do. tolerance weapons policy “to keep people safe.” Give break. Way care employees don’t feel safe walking work. Short Answer: no.

Long answer: Still no. decisions made based evidence. single right time every city, region, country impose lift public health measures.

The goal keep virus’s reproductive number &lt;1; whatever tools necessary deployed make happen, policies ranked much effect vs. much hardship cause. effective tool fast diagnosis isolation infected, plus contact tracing catches people’s contacts gets quarantine tested negative.

Beyond that, reducing time spent indoors, reducing number people spent indoors together time, getting everyone wear masks, etc. useful population-wide interventions, relatively low cost. bit painful, also effective, least essential highest risk businesses remain closed (e.g. bars movie theaters), financial support workers make sure weather crisis.

If tools don’t suffice bring reproduction number virus &lt;1, cases high effective contact tracing, start overwhelming hospital capacity, dramatic curfew / business closures / etc. become necessary. that's true. think COVID holdouts increased hand sanitizing active knowledge emerging worldwide health issues. i'm also hoping social distancing stays place somewhat - like stores doctors offices. that's mostly wishful thinking like people business. studied ways children process use information hidden masks say children find ways communicate, parents teachers help. I’m honored! noticed back Trumpolini fits relationship Putler tee. mouth cowardice compared Putler’s cunning ruthless approach foreign domestic policy. meat hooks waiting... Erh no. 500 hospital lockdown, lockdown made drop fast. like 30 since then.

What nothing like wave March. we've beat wave 2 second snd third biggest cities already. UK approved anti-emetic thalidomide morning sickness US not, one heroic woman refusing despite pressure, stating evidence needed safe pregnant women.

turns causes major birth defects, UK, Europe, rest world got whole large cohort ""flipper babies"" US (mostly) spared same, FDA opted bit cautious.

You could say allowing felons guns constitution wording 2nd amendment, is. he's insinuating contact tracing cuts spread, he's telling truth. full stories people contacted way late tracing stop anything, happening all. 

Even 90% contacts refuse, catching 10% reduces R 10%. 10% lot better 0%. abundantly clear, chance dying virus less winning lottery back back. chance getting noted higher sure gives crap? Get life Ahhh got it. Thanks clarification. admit idea might good Let's educate people en mass possible next generation *grin* CVS okay either customer service. I'm running options. Man, draconian. try empathy people want wear masks? 29 million people reinfected, let's panic assume worst handful cases. like people want worst possible news. bit positivity. doesn’t mean group reached effective heard immunity. 

Madrid measured percentage anti bodies Stockholm. 15% so. Madrid don’t seem protected moment, Stockholm. good idea examine health records recent past. adding year (via fauci) 2024 timeline. pretty much creating fake news. Well go then, probably miss you. UK currently rise one aggressive early spikes. Look Spain/UK: That's Florida/Texas try repeat reopening way.  would treated like flu, we'd million dead, many home without treatment, second wave would paled comparison first. Hmm, seems like Tallahassee / Northern Florida appear worse spikes. I’m original dude btw. saying thought logic based on.

No need go throat lol.  Pooh Bear entered chat.

In seriousness, yeah, started earlier thought. change much. Sweden kept example 50 person limit, almost countries allowed much bigger crowds, today Dresden, Dresden playing German Football Cup: 10,000 stadium, sure masks, people still hugging strangers, celebrating together. Meanwhile Sweden: Lady's team Piteå (I think them) invited 50 spectators, teams playing empty ranks. Yep, right Sweden stricter others. Sorry, what's point? I’ll never go Rite aid again. used work doesn’t surprise me. wrote lengthy online complaint maybe get feedback spineless corporate work home decision fire lady didn’t want potential DIE. plan already multi-pronged. Improve treatments reduce infection. CFR already dropping treatments better ICU/ventilator capacity held up. Infection rate dropped social distancing immunity starting build. 

End 2021 estimated return proper, 2019-style normalcy. things start look normal. takes see death stats, spread overnight.  Hey, English great, fyi numbers go like this.

Vietnam, New Zealand, Malyasia etc. TINY compared US. Could be. live NYC remember 20% May, daily briefings anymore, they'd update us antibodies, IDK now. remember hitting 66% areas NYC late May. death rates low Europe, worrying it? There's probably lot contributing factors, good thing. means change one factors deaths still remain low. dont think single state dealt large spike actually gone back up. pretty interesting. Swedish. might know many countries people restrictions many hours get leave home day. wear police monitors punishes transgressions. 
This would call ""strict regulations"" quite alien Sweden is. 

While Swedes might higher general compliance government recommendations many countries, plenty transgressions everywhere virtually consequences offender.
I think important thing Swedes social distance naturally space so. authorities telling us do. truly hate country. number dumb selfish imbeciles country jaw dropping. dangerous words sub, careful... cannot believe comments. Australia retail business owner never got abused anyone. one customer used make sexual comments young female staff. would walk away. One time store group people. frosty him. asked why. told apologised. never commented young girls again. left customers knew business locally real estate.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Wtf media watching? Everywhere see says dangerous older people pre-existing conditions. I’ve never claimed group A, Sweden Stockholm reached herd immunity, simply stated immunity Sweden Denmark due people exposed virus far. Thats it. 10,000 dead last month great US standards, still something think I'd celebrate. source says hospitalization rate age group 72.5 per 100,000 individuals. considered amount asymptomatic people people light symptoms chalk cold? people included covid-positive count hospitalization data.

The reality people experience variety symptoms. none. feel sick couple days. Others severe illness need medical attention and/or die. statistics say majority healthy young people get severe illness.  ones? Vitamin vitamin vitamin D! 

I dont know dont every living human taking vitamin D?!? Right data based people willing go bars pandemic. based general population people still locked social distancing. infection rate stabilized certain portion population. people get complacent stop social distancing taking precautions numbers rise again. state close immunity yet, least according data currently have. Never bad idea: go it! Well yes, takes time things distributed. problem decide best always best OTHERS society whole. freedom end hurts others actions influences other. called living society considered others.

(Only side note: Really, idea freedom people weird America. add that, observe United States ones screaming freedom often try LIMIT freedom groups (abortion, LBGT, etc.).) Hospitalizations tiny fraction April UK Spain.

*Cases* way young people getting it. We've seen story play dozen places know anecdotes I'm going add also horrible illness January.

I'm younger, healthy, generally get sick, specifically remember driving back errand halfway across state, sick hell, sick 7 days, unable get sick wasnt culturally acceptable months ago, getting halfway back pull caught breath singing along radio. weird. 

Other signing (badly congested) sitting there, breath. sat minute, coughed nasty shit door, drove home, took time 3ish days exhausted low fever general cheat tightness woke morning feeling 95% fine.

Despite living outside Detroit (major March/April hotspot) never covid symptoms officially ""here"". Humans use facial expressions learn behaviours yes, denying ability see fully people react social situations developing understanding world impede them. 

Don’t need scientist work out. courage convictions join Melbourne, probably STFU. Wait assumption call police they're automatically going kill someone? That's quite skewed perspective. Lets forget media U.S. automatically highlight controversial events whatever's buzz moment. Let's also forget terrible officer interactions highlighted (admittedly they're favors) hundreds thousands interactions daily officers people. kill humanity first? global warming covid19? place bets ladies gentlemen EXACTLY Republican Governor handled schools reopening. said individual districts could make call themselves, bunch started choosing remote, put literal color-by-numbers map basically says ""GREEN = GO SCHOOL PERSON"".

Mind you, funding, mandate even mild suggestion test students teachers. fucking disaster waiting happen Ayyy get Cool, keep up. Hope football games wind wrecking efforts. never noticed genuine smiles also eyes (and even *mostly* eyes)? Even babies know this. future covid-19 vaccine one time dose seasonal vaccine? I’m boat mom (not going since March), venture dr appointments longer push yes, you’re correct putting risk every time go out. personally getting flu shot year since times go doctor wear respirator, otherwise continue isolate home. heard ideas thrown around drive flu shots might consider becomes thing. see primary doctor something I’ll consider also, won’t venture solely get shot. Right answer: Yes. know around time converted McCormick place hospital, things seemed pretty dire. one thought virus circulating infecting people way thought, worst already hit us. Maybe. Another thought I’ve novelty danger may worn off, people “used to” disease risks live anyway know would “lesson burden little bit”? Money. whole 12 hours week 45 enough feed house family 3, yeah, I’m little anxious. It’s late summer. We’re vitamin adequate now. help Board also cuckoo Coco puffs! They're mostly anti-science. resolution passed end local health emergency filled pseudo-science nonsense. also generally pretty young low risk? question I'm hoping someone would know answer to. quarantining contact confirmed positive person, get tested last day quarantine?

I friends saying need showing symptoms, asymptomatic need quarantine longer? testing way determine that? lot I've looking mention getting tested end look symptoms. 
“I'm sure Sweden test more, want ot system Denmark get tested everyday without anyone asking questions.”

Ah, myth guys r/sweden keep bringing Danes testing without reason. 

In reality difference Denmark test, trace isolate asymptomatic cases Sweden not. Currently 60% new cases Denmark found people small symptoms tested - - cases would found Sweden. 

“The problem politicians decide take actions, again.”

I really cannot see anyone would prefer Swedish method politicians taking responsibility resulting 5 times dead per capita. 

Denmark also rising numbers new cases since early July without increase hospitalisation. begun last weeks. virus spread slowly amongst young people summer. didn’t get sick. seem reached tipping point virus widespread enough spill infect vulnerable groups. 

It’s unlikely Sweden simply month two behind Denmark development. It’s low infection rate. Renew Netflix subscriptions folks! There's antibody test available figure out.  true, fact baked concept herd immunity. Often people talk herd immunity, they're starting assumption everything totally normal. lived like lived 2019, that's need often-quoted 70% number reach herd immunity.

But actually, herd immunity depends behavior circumstances herd. moving target based human behavior. Take prison example. prison utopia virus. Everyone sleeps eats together every day. People constantly forced within 2 feet one another long periods time. Would 70% immunity able stop virus spreading situation? course not. would need way that. Probably damn never every person would catching ever started fade away. world today though, situation opposite. people staying home more, large gatherings, people wearing masks staying away others. know parts world live, never even see people talk one another public anymore. Stores practically silent. Even gym silent. We're living normally all. ~70% number goes way down. what, wonder? idea. I'll bet playing major role lot previously hard-hit places seem avoiding secondary outbreaks far. buddy taken antibody test. Exactly: human hard-wired learn, plastic brain, adaptable child 7. would care organization even country? I'm laughing, like rest world tbh, ineptitudes short comings U.S. healthcare system NJ, it’s state order. Almost every store sign says mask service. thought decided ventilating generally bad stopped? think question Trump wins re-election. Without adults take federal response lose virus. Plot twist: you’re wearing red shirt move

75% world would love live  Americans’ reliance cars reduced transmission rate significantly. Yep. see continues today too. brigading really got go. pretty much anyone posting reddit part global rich get vaccine parents, hand... can’t U.S. provide universal health care? Um U.S. greedy country Resorting ad hominem attacks already huh? Well least I’ve got years working China, fluency Chinese able verify facts myself. 

And finally, they’ve covered past mean manage well later. Past action used predict future behaviour evidence rely on. Many European countries smack middle second wave. Well, that’s mercy. Hopefully they’ll learn secure better, encrypt better 🤞 get arguments having. researched, less half viruses causing common cold rhinoviruses. Coronaviruses cause common link posted lists coronaviruses causes common cold.

Not coronavirus ... changed NYC prevent restarting cycle? testing tracing? dopes pushing dope dopes funneling cash faster wealthy elite politicians. Living box brain made for.

And addition that, millions people west coast US able go outside even open window, due wildfire smoke. Sun stars also visible four straight days. brown haze 24/7. Tom Wolf's pandemic restrictions required people stay home, placed size limits gatherings ordered ""non-life-sustaining"" businesses shut unconstitutional, federal judge ruled Monday.

It's like people supporting protests, complaining political rallies. 

Both protected right assemble. Based CDC reaction COVID19 Feb Mar, didn’t even resources investigate new virus.

Quite likely, it’s China first discovered virus, Virus spread across world. 14 doublings instead 20. 

20 = 1,000,000

19 = 500,000

18= 250,00

17 = 125,000

16= 62,500

15 = 31,250

14 = 15,625

So exponential function places laws masks, especially city/county level enforced. People charged attempted murder. strong suspicion nearly everyone catches covid nervous system damage organ damage permanent.

lol prove otherwise? HIV appeared San Francisco early 70’s one knew. Ah ok, thanks info. Vietnam tiny? 100 million citizens. Anyone who's ever taken recreational drugs automatically made take vaccine.

It's almost infection bad thing overall.

Or stick heads rear ends play endless rhetorical games governor FL saying ZERO evidence children spread covid actively suppressing data, ZERO confirmed cases school transmission contact tracing taking steps would allow confirmations, etc.

You'd love governor. He's always thing. Kids count. Nursing homes count. Non residents count. People pre existing conditions count. 

Meanwhile, non residents taking test every single day count... they're negative. end, disinformation prove deadly virus. research found flu bad, worse.

Since *you’re* totally arguing bad faith, point mention this.  retrieve bottles whatever else threw outhouse

Where live problem? don’t believe it, it’s oddly specific stupid thing people frequently enough need kind solution. like way think, though. aint going nowhere herd immunity achieved. 

Not sure. examples near eradication near normal functioning without vaccine. I'd say Taiwan, China, Australia, New Zealand time, Thailand, etc. aggressive, suppress virus well enough, also building testing tracing infrastructure, use Test, Trace, Isolate (TTI) push near eradication, eradicate completely. point, though, think we're close vaccine ever country prove theory extended period time. essentially ""Phase 4"" trial, long-term surveillance drug discover rare side-effects. occurs distribution generally ongoing long vaccine distributed.

Phase testing basic toxicity vaccine. Phase II detecting immune response. Phase III testing efficacy. way works split subjects two arms: larger one vaccine smaller one placebo. monitor everyone infection. Whenever placebo arm reaches certain infection threshold, see test arm doing. point, simple math:

1 - (Infection Rate Test Arm / Infection Rate Control Arm) = Efficacy

As real world example, let's say choose 10% threshold test arm 1% infection rate point:

1 - (.01 / .10) = .90 90% efficacy, incredibly good. vaccines fall mark, especially certain populations (young/elderly, men/women, certain races ethnicities, etc.)

Because many people getting sick right now, actually helpful vaccine trials helps get threshold quickly. That's big reason ChAdOx1, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech predicting results couple months starting trials. significant percentage control arms infected virus helping reach conclusive result quickly.

If happen know someone trial get sick, sure thank get better. might literally owe life likely saved many thousands lives indirectly. actually apologetic said ""it small gathering got hand"". creating strawmen get angry age old tradition Reddit. think referring ""over"" response.

So, absolutely certain #51-3022	'Meat, Poultry, Fish Cutters Trimmers' employee meat plant got COVID died, would say ""Nope - #51-3023 'Slaughterers Meat Packers' employee! count death!""  sheer case numbers yes due population, Chicago is, region currently state mandated mitigation due community spread either (like parts state). said, also fully IL phase four either due local mitigation tactics significantly harsher state's. complicated. However, go regional positivity rates, definitely better lot regions.  talking Pfizer mRNA vaccine. Moderna’s. American here. given maximum possible penalty. sorry many fellow citizens decided act like jackasses year. 😕 smartest thing I've read long while. Even teachers suddenly unessential. students ""get"" stay home, to. I'm sure many parents would love send kids school rather pay added childcare costs or, many cases, forced stay home themselves. teachers country enjoying strong union large voting block, US wages stagnated since 1990 teachers' incomes doubled areas. Ask air traffic controllers country treated went strike. wonder health condition was... probably fat. fuckload us fat. whole thing sensationalism. Obesity, side effects, still remains biggest risk factor (Just flu every year).

I've known 3 people who've Gym (nobody wears masks gym), described MILD cold. surprising healthy, normal weight individuals.

Again, people genetically predisposed become gravely ill anything, LIKE FLU. exception, rule.

Seems kind excessive shut entire economy this.... called “essential workers” inherently classist way thinking, work essential someone always right work, told useless. Yeah. absolute power move Saw add Tenant today. mentioned movies returning theaters. might I’m not. Huh, noticed.

Also happy cake day. Exactly! guy older guys also since pandemic began: selfish inconsiderate assholes. ridiculous say US ""pretty nice"" say ""one worst."" 

You changed ""hellish"" ""one worst."" 

And comment things pretty nice referring pretty nice new small global democracies America paves way protects. fund large military US Navy ensures global free trade. That's pretty nice bet extra cash helps improving citizens work lives.

&amp;#x200B;

The US bit worse expected list lot ""hellish"" work conditions due culture rights violations.  list Japan 2 worked Japanese company work significantly hours average us due culture. Japan 2 US 4 tell 100% would rather worker US.

Ignoring culture going data provided still say 40% globe better work conditions constitutes ""hellish"" conditions. Maybe y'all thinking hell nicer word normally means fucking abysmal terrible situations me. According source 60% planet would ""hellish"" work conditions like 30% would working something worse hellish conditions. Gloating? think mourning dead. 

Edit: think neighbors Finland Norway much entitled gloat. 

Edit 2: Yes, voted without rebuttal. Sweden wrong, guess. Im teacher person teaching. need tell this. school ventilation, fans allowed, HEPA filters. Ya... agree. teachers infect one another real miracle. people died state 3 months whole China. visited China: spitting public thing Shanghai. hit several times...

I wonder infectious disease controlled circumstances.

Edit: knew people would downvote! that’s basically fact: like they're trying cull themselves.... appears prevalent Americans though. else explain spectacular failure dealing COVID US? would meat institute lie many workers have? possible reason?

Its trade association. literally paid meat production companies represent serve them. also information meat cancer goes general scientific consensus. literally organization created propaganda data largely self submitted. EU representatives China studies may hint this, matter

It's foundational principle outbreak response vaccinate likely create outbreaks.

What sort job entirely unrelated epidemiology do? correct. Editing post now. actual victims - apparently apparently short grave diggers. \*Saskatchewan

And even Saskatchewan. janitors sanitize night, too, I'm little skeptical; there've days already past two weeks thing looks like touched garbage door. Kids allowed shortly first period begins allowed eat breakfast rooms(!) I've seen breakfast crumbs go untouched next day.

I've also left books open desk pages curled come spray, though, know they're something least time. Really concerned friend pregnant works nursing home there. least one case among staff luckily spread residents... knew came anyway.

That's terrifying positivity rate, test less people... know math works... one kind wishes they'd broadcast grade level's courses public TV, fire 90% current teaching staff, refund everyone's tax savings? mean, argument remote learning works, schools childcare, WTF paying for? keep buildings? employ people clean them, maintain them, secure teach them? need 40 teachers 1 district teaching grade level remotely 1 teacher offer lesson 40 districts remotely? lot places is. US finished first wave projected get much worse gets better. We'll see people start careful masks social distancing gets increasingly colder. Yea Chicago better still covid epicenter Illinois. still heat empty building. Pipes freeze, things would break otherwise. federal government supports them, like every non-third world country. Nothing locked in.

We fraction infections deaths masks became thing.

The vast majority deaths happened infections came well told mask up.

We knew surface infections secondary far earlier hence social distancing, April 3rd mask became recommended.

7,516 deaths 257,794 infections day.

Fast forward two weeks account delays infection symptoms two weeks symptoms death you’re May 1st.

May first 65,103 deaths 1,109,640 infections.

Since another 128k deaths 5.4 million infections. Free  time people think teachers ""off"" spent grading

My father English teacher. came home, ate dinner, started grading papers. graded evening long, every evening school let out. Unless someone experienced personally, guarantee they're severely underestimating much time goes grading papers.

Good luck year. Take care yourself. means making argument regarding expertise. statement “he” would feel comfortable. yeah, case age matter. worries! Thanks clarifying. enclosed space much worse ventilation outdoors; virus airborne. many restaurants still restrict services take-out many health specialists advise eating restaurants offer option. comedy club especially hazardous--a type venue desperately needs enforce stricter mask policies, possibly restaurants--because people laughing shouting direction stage, spread virus particles much talking. difficult pull mask taking bite food drinking. I’ve never car accident I’m gonna stop wearing seatbelt Wife teaches kindergarten south FL. virtual learning, workload basically tripled. dealing anxiety-induced rashes well elevated blood pressure last weeks. I'm worried fucking irately angry anyone demanding go back MIDDLE FUCKING PANDEMIC.

Now south FL going phase 2 opening schools back menu, we've already discussing resigning schools re-open. make enough cover bills risk worth it. one situation. Several teachers waiting return put retirement resign. Florida already dealing teacher shortage expect make worse. job worth it. $40k year. [he - everyone falls line villain. 

£10000 fine 19 year old? Anyone age would lucky make year. student probably doesn’t. It’s okay uphold law lose sense process. £1000 would devastating, £10000 could put debt long time.

Consider reserving judgement people wanting live life unless already know people behind stories right. need senate pass HEROES act HoR passed back May people, millions like them, support need.

Frankly could care less “the people want eat there”. Can’t microwave food home? That’s applesbees doing. Given fact Korea imported 23 cases China stuck 19 cases months, countries imported multiple times that, I'm worried community spread mainland China versus elsewhere. I'll still interested knowing 4 cases travel history though. could given emergency vaccine made appear positive (such mine workers PNG), guess since know anything magically go away country 1.4 billion people.*

The problem argument considered months enforced severe lockdowns, manual contact tracing widespread mask-wearing ""magical"". Yep Still cannot deny fact country blocks reddit ... ridiculous reasons That’s weird. knew foreigner States I’d extra friendly willing help out, would Americans.

Who miracle worker put many years needed teach type?  Right OMG happening everywhere! Every single democratic city burning! it'll get suburbs soon! STOP THEM! Sigh.

Kenosha stopped burning right-wing Kenosha Guard left; one murderous gun nuts charged rest got scared real fast. Portland protestors still fighting proudboys boogaloos streets, cops trump's gestapo. Chicago's fire all, Minneapolis, Seattle, LA. 93% protests started ended peacefully.

You've lied to, PickleRick. knew that. setting example people go eat. thing missing *just restaurant open say okay mean okay*.

Restaurants open seating all, outside not. know restaurant offers outside seating offer bathrooms well? think things *really* getting cleaned? perfect plan avoid Covid falls apart second flush toilet restroom somebody covid could using. evacuate bet deaths pork plants. pigs known catch coronaviruses (there many types), likely pigs handling infected covid-19. viral spread increases due people staying indoors contraindication lockdowns?

Obviously not, no. Lockdown, nobody talking about, would mean people socializing person people since things like restaurants, movie theaters gyms would closed. Cold/bad weather makes people socialize indoors instead outdoors, spreads viruses lot more. predicated 400,000 Americans dead COVID-19 end year. point almost possible U.S. fewer COVID-19 deaths Spanish flu (flu pandemic 1918) deaths time enough people get vaccinated. Yeah, I’m normally conspiracy theorist particular date recommended vaccines, including annual flu shots everyone family. healthcare worker work people high risk I’m signing first round vaccines administration. Sorry sorry. US Military Hotel (been myself) definitely possible attached military (as civilian employee, probably dependent) also active duty military. know based places already outbreaks least deadly indicated. It’s like subtract dead people. state 109 deaths due flu. 1900 covid deaths it’s already 19x deadly. also undercut CDC. Pulled us world health organization tried motivate people refuse wear masks. What's interesting appears get wear mask, wash food get let sit bit table outside super aware touching. personally lived one epicenters entire time... yet stick rules I'm good. thanks government.   Lol Brazil U.S. joined hip this. Nearly precisely number cases per capita, deaths per capita. big difference possibility ""non-pharamceutical interventions"" many Brazilians (a lot Americans too, lower percentage). Try going Sao Paulo suggesting ""more telecommuting,"" see kinds looks get. People gotta eat, government incompetent. happen, happen. Life goes on. that’s dangerous sets wrong precedent  people hate us Kind surprised American service member, Garmisch popular destination US Military folks serving Europe. MWR Hotel (stayed dad stationed Ramstein 90's) American's area pretty common thing (although know currently active Covid-19 going on) Süddeutsche Zeitung reports [maximum penalty quarter million Knowing German legal system, probably get fined maximum, I'm sure let easy either. Fellow Oregonian here, confirm. Either literally read sentence literally zero critical thinking ability. COVID shut market; government did. debate relative benefits costs shutdown, virus that; policy decision.

If legitimately can't understand that, that's fine -- probably sit one out. Thanks input.   true don’t responsibility delegate responsibility states. act delegating states, shirked responsibility. 

Trump ultimately responsible fact knew along even told someone makes impossible deny responsibility. That's really bizarre headline. group *27* countries collectively cases US. seems like they're implying US bad now. nothing thing. 10% provides protection 5%. 15% 10%.  less novel virus population, less devastating is. 

And idea really now, particularly merit theory % population already immunity based exposure viruses. think far-fetched all. think hard lot people grasp severity virus can't *see* it. want try tangible metaphor.

Let's say world agrees shooting people really bad health; fact, people die shot. countries around world take extreme precautions try keep people shooting one another.

This church declares people, ""don't believe nonsense, bring guns Sunday we'll shoot!"" defiance safety measures, hundreds people gather building; encouragement leader, start shooting hour. leader delights it. die wounds soon after, take months die it, others spend rest lives crippled shooting gallery.

But that's end. leader, holding gathering, tells flock go back communities, keep full clip loaded, keep shooting. Shoot blindly go restaurants, go grocery shopping, shoot every public place go to, keep gathering people like shoot they're together, aiming wildly.

Some die, won't. even know bullet even came close them.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, metaphor, think /u/SkidRowTrash hitting nail head: end business, liquidation assets help caught crossfire, jail time leaders.  almost like school's open something aiming total eradication, every time domestic case unknown infection source pops up, announce person's movements past days, isolate test person's contacts, test entire neighborhood still can't trace source, test basically whole city that. Beijing, Xinjiang Dalian. None done quietly, believe numbers. trying hide cases, would able effective contact tracing. family Beijing near Wuhan report life pretty much returned normal, except masks still mandatory indoors areas. Always been. 

r/antinatalism  mean sometimes one else get medicine need money work flaired ""Good News""? Reddit hive mine sure strange. supports people rioting looting US, supports arresting people protest government shutting economy Australia. yeah goes show even educated people arrogant dumbasses Yes, teachers' fault. bright one, you? Maybe go back school. According latest trump commercials, disease waning, vaccine arrive day, Biden wants collapse economy, trump leading America's great comeback. 

So yeah basically ignore reality per usual last four years. 100%. work electronics bunch 22AWG solid core wire. Two 22AWG wires twisted together perfect! mould around bridge nose. masks make good seal around chin cheeks air escaping there. \_need\_ wire got glasses. 

I got couple masks work single twist-tie them. Useless. cut put 22AWG wire them. Miles better.

An unfolded paperclip might work okay well. tried personally though. Agree. then, wont choice. I’ve getting sushi sitting park eat it. place usually packed weekends wonder cases going around here.  Careful; get bunch uneducated morons ""read"" study misinterpreted mean actually, everybody gets infected long-term clinical impairment yelling that, they'll link somebody internet complaining they've suffering 9 months ""pRoOf!!!"" think look cool. Like ninja 😷 actually things? Bonus points links actual reporting this. Strange never saw bored surfing internet day home nothing else focus several months Smithfield Ham people. Imagine Karen's this, LMAO would throw biggest temper tantrums ever. federal government may power nationwide lockdown, compel one. close airports, lockdown interstates, shut waterways ports. roundabout way, squeeze states make call diplomacy fails. perp needing retrieve trash makes sense poetic justice way, I’d kinda worried contagion spreading. Someone throwing garbage literal shithole might trustworthy terms sanitation. salmonella risk jumping might best side effect there. 

Of course, enforce strict hand washing rule hose after, go it. Pick crap, Gerald (not literally, please). know thing never never know many cases COVID truly are. result, can't know mortality rate. I'm saying lethal, I'm saying know lethal is. would still encourage people behave though 50x lethal flu. Opening windows option right schools anywhere else unhealthy dangerous levels smoke wildfires. Schools open, period. mean took one sore throat nasal congestion. wanted sure lol wear mask like good citizen would to. fewer cases covid ever before. 

Obviously 40,000+ cases per day nowhere near ""fewer cases ever understand English meaning ""fewer cases ever before""? 

Yeah, fewer cases ever would zero cases, genius. We're nowhere near zero cases. severe acute respiratory syndrome. Ah yes, Arkansas ass deep outhouses, they're everywhere. What's magical device got spittin' water? Faucet? Dang that's fancy. Naw yeah, Arkansans sitting 1700's. /s coaching team would won. people England whose parents probably afford schools, somehow kid (or kids) went anyway. case, doubt would case person went 30k year school (given 30k year 3-5 times annual fees usual ""bog-standard"" run-of-the-mill fee-paying high school).

It's different States however... mean, get wrong, feel terrible many people dying. sometimes difficult is, always trying careful. 

Quarantine fatigue, know term, think real, feels exactly like this. I'd riot case second lockdown I'm sure mental health take plunge. 

Hopefully we'll try go Sweden way time.  positive rate stayed Florida gone like article states. completely incorrect hypothesis nice thats actual good studies done shouldnt get hopes up.

I never heard phenomena getting immunity masks time. studies observations done illnesses like regular flu something? never said choose specific app reason paranoid. sad sickening see area high numbers virus cases high numbers deniers. works important. safe also important. Many rushed knowing work unsafe early. Polio dengue fever ones remember top head, least couple others, too. u bothered take test...ur pretty high risk bendy metal masks 1/3 tin tie top coffee bag! local coffee shop unused ties let us free. makes huge difference. school strain internet UNBEARABLE. teaching Deaf kids via sign language lagging frozen videos means kids can't learn bc admin demands see us campus. Oh share working space masks means communicating ASL incredibly difficult. Free willy We're constantly setting new records. honestly idea fuck talking about. Teacher here. teacher make significantly less that. Decade experience masters degree I'm even there. Still told come live. Yeah also given option cook  manage contain it/fight it? rest world can't seem figure out, China shared solution? Probably one. Lol yeah right. know President is?  Yes. is. able keep R0 close 1 far fewer restrictions involved lockdown. see country far open March, able keep cases steady falling. cases low R0 close 1, cases continue low indefinitely.

What happened California states locked preemptively lockdown unsustainable, open back up, far quickly. ended delaying inevitable vs. finding sustainable level restriction combined testing/contact tracing would allowed keep cases low indefinitely. Bullshit too. - US initiated Pandemic Response plan back January/February, country would outbreak deaths manner nd COVID behind us
 - COVID actually test rates dropping. look number test reported going many areas seeing COVID case positivesgo up
 - Instead control, US control. Matter fact coming weeks break earlier records hospitalizations daily deaths.
 - Ask Herman Cain worked I'd assume poor people working families safe either. mean I’m cautiously optimistic know keep hopes high. Hopefully next summer beyond lit though. Yeah, workout N95, protected. Check ventilation changes they've made (filters +air changes + % recirculated), may need something difficult breathe ventilation good, social distancing rules effect, everyone wearing masks. Thank pointing out. Massachusetts currently positivity rate 1 percent, among best country. average currently 5 percent US, states still 10 percent.

This reasonable question ask Massachusetts. opinion reasonable question ask Florida. first one excuse used people really want latter, refuse accept reality might get virus themselves. want speak viruses manager.

Yeah, dealt long term symptoms, haven't. article mentions 3/4 people HOSPITAL long term symptoms, thats fraction worst total cases looked at. point hope sustained immunity catching virus (which apparently looking fairly promising now? knows.) Yep! let people make decision want take risk. vaccine works 90% vaccinate oldest 10% Americans death rate drop order magnitude. Hopefully vaccines work, especially elderly. Must feel need go despite sick due manifest destiny. civilian employee limited tenure contract. she'd since june 2019 would it? Sure, would work better authorian leader friends - rest? much depends defnition what's 'better' isn't.

For rest? Well, indeed depends definition ""better"". like think meaning ""better future vast majority population"".

Two quick links found interesting topic:
* [What ultimate test political Zhang WeiWei. argues ""good governance vs bad governance"" better political paradigm ""democracy vs autocracy"" obsolete. debatable course tend agree. whole 10-series Zhang WeiWei's short video good watch anyone willing learn bit China (it's pretty basic, doubt average Westerner know much really).
* [Götterdämmerung: Rule 2h debate Nexus Conference 2019, failure elite Western liberal order leadership could like future. whole debate quite interesting, Eric Li makes excellent points regarding China, versus worries speakers rise China. Apart Afghan woman, Westerners.

For rest, mostly agree point rest argument, except point privacy: China care privacy, US either. EU cares (see Snowden's NSA scandal mass surveillance). yes, see little US democratic system actually reflects value democratic system, rotten decide accept deaths exchange values important society. make one solution worse though, different.

Well, one little difference though, form potentially hundred thousand avoidable deaths. would also add test allow people vote not. shared views, they'd allowed vote, I'm right. continue wearing masks. designs actually pretty cool. actually going wear one covid started easy get decent design also pretty much prohibited laws. Hope laws relaxed keep wearing them. obviously impossible tell. studies coming countries hit earliest, studies particular process regarding childredn, definition kind thing takes time get grip on.

You're completely misunderstanding point, though:

More cases = long term damage.

Don't need study calculator that.

This sort nonsense governor does, though. keeps pushing things saying one prove obviously axiomatically true. can't PROVE children catch it, says behave like happen. can't PROVE children infectious adults, behave like aren't. Coupled actively forcing counties STOP publishing active case info school populations, ticking timebomb ignorance.  thought ""a cold"" sent home early shift, friends told get tested. got tested, wait results go out, spent night partying (there friends leaving week) got positive test results next day. 

source: used work literally missed shitshow two weeks Goes show Russians, Cold War never really ended, went period reorganization America let guard. There's doubt take higher risk *not* going, still low. think need personal risk assessment:

* First, consider social circle interact with. I'm talking ones take fewest precautions around. Think one ""unit"" looking eachother. anyone see regularly higher risk caring for/regularly interacting someone higher risk- I'd carefully consider choice go gym, choice continue socializing them.
* Second, consider risk. relatively low-risk complications, worry much. higher risk factors, I'd think twice.
* Third, consider widespread virus area.

Sounds like given ton thought probably done exercise already- I'd say beat up- there's right wrong answer. feel good- go it! - simply file Assault Battery charges, file lawsuit pain suffering. Wear mask take precautions. Don’t need vaccine. I’m going near anyone anyway! Well, that's boys, pack go home. Someone reddit said we're getting it. /s meant those, got it. company know actual vaccine it’s cash cow .

The likelihood someone dying COVID 20s appears relatively low it’s means negligible that’s without considering risk older people young adults interact accounting comorbidity. see 1% people 34 become infected require hospitalization nearly patients (close 90% last checked speaks difficulty treating virus, source number) suffer chronic health problems recovery. right think risk taking generally way do— nothing without risk. sounds like fundamentally misunderstand risk disease presents relative activities mention.

Corona isn’t fucking death sentence it’s time stop acting like is. panic led extreme defiance virus

wut also short turnaround testing

So enough test trace contain infections

Ireland? make mention things like paid time forth.

So US Fuck dictators make illegal leave house go drive.

A woman literally ticketed PA driving... Virgil sucks care Reading exchange back, think 59179 thought BrushApprehensive697 saying highly unlikely debunked, fact saying object transference debunked. agreeing along. Women 11%, Men 10%.

Not dramatic difference tbh. 1%. 

Tbh would weird decreased exact amount. lot reports like this. symptoms ""textbook""? symptoms mild COVID cases identical dozens viral infections. severe cases distinctive, mild ones. People turning they're back Fauci turning backs truth.

Anyone says negative doom gloom really understanding situation correctly. gentle honest. pessimistic all. doctor tells might cancer, pessimistic. doctor refuses emphasize yes, people's bodies cure cancer sometimes without intervention, refusing give facts take neutral position. category 5 hurricane made landfall louisiana two weeks ago, meteorologists ""being negative"" said could 15 foot unsurvivable storm surge get trapped attic tools bust roof drown. There's gentle way tell someone that. There's ""balanced"" neutral position. 

This *is* neutral position. thing would make people feel better *lies.* case, truth hurts. truth fall could bad people need take seriously. storm surge could 15 feet maybe 5. prepare 5! prepare maximum,15! 

My friend sick ICU right Covid. bad shape may intubated gets worse. He's breathing 75% oxygen. Room oxygen 21%. virus fucking kill loved ones. Even old. family member intubated navy SEAL last week 20s.

We prepare maximum. best case scenario makes us feel better. that's depressing people, still must respected adults told truth. Give chance live reality get help need it. 

Criticizing Fauci bumming everyone criticizing reality bummer. external team UK deemed reaction due vaccine per se trial restarted less every country testing it, US halting may use either way undermine other. would fine American politics tend bleed country ever considered research surrounding spread via protests could politically biased?

Everything's always conspiracy, eh?

Have ever considered look bias believe scientific studies? know anything yet pontificate also done late. 

Imagine island, could different............. 😟 least check date OP. posted multiple times last week. Here's link curious person referring to: testing much. daily tests given directly related demand.

The positivity rate US net soon saw took knife, outrage subsided. cool pulling pepper spray though. There's something called overshoot. Let's 20% number herd immunity social distancing masking efforts. idea isn't, let's say is.

If 15%, go 25% 30% see plateau decline. mean 20% wrong, means 15%, still spreading overshot herd immunity percentage. yeah I'm sure families dead permanently damaged draw strength insipid nonsense PA citizens, rulings businesses could stay open arbitrary.

But huge issue law literally could drive unless going somewhere essential. That's pretty big no. hate say deescalated situation let go. Even CDC recommends confronting.

I hate ask, attack first place? make ""first punch?""

She knew use weapon customer. 

I pray wish well pursuit new career. likely get false positive test late. virus tends stick around long done making others sick. also 6/6 treating actual patients Forced labor? sub sad. Seems like best way deal anti-maskers convinced hoax.   Wow, would thought, would revert old ways women stayed home since kids cant go school, man works. soon dead ears anyway

How high ya'll think death rate thing is? Lmao Arizona weekend. Parker Dam specifically SW AZ. single mask sight, zero social distancing. would thought normal weekend covid river. 

I event film FPV DJI drones. place see masks hotel, employees one else. 

I kept mask stayed away people could next 10-14 days may interesting  Again, fired weapon work

Is knife weapon? tool cutting open packages? types things lawyers get paid convince judges juries. False positives antibody test pretty unusual days (which used case). happen, probably asymptomatic case. Mmm official Chinese “data”.

I’m sure it’s super accurate goal seeked garbage make CCP look good! able achieve complete blockage viral replication an *in vitro* model

What wonderful news, let's hope vivo results good😊 couldnt get away? act like easy behind counter one way out. Also harder run away person alot bigger female. HA! Really, eh? ever considered research surrounding spread via protests could politically biased? fool think streets packed shoulder shoulder protesters cause least transmissions. studies also flawed rely data ask protest participation. article linked non peer reviewed junk. China handling pandemic better authoritarian government. I’m saying fascists nazis whatever, central government without doubt power US government. Obviously handle pandemic better US. happens pandemic? browse internet without VPN, many children want, don’t worry say read. yes, guess life right better China (unless you’re muslim). thankful fortunate living USA. Everyone bad mouthing trailblazing piece fashion missing important part hard plastic covering doubles hat — flipped up, like visor

IT DOUBLES HAT GUYS!! fool would think worth price.

^^^I'm ^^^being ^^^sarcastic ^^^btw... *__Important things tremendous impact, origin SARS-CoV-2 remained mysterious controversial. natural origin theory, although widely accepted, lacks substantial support. alternative theory virus may come research laboratory is, however, strictly censored peer-reviewed scientific journals. origin SARS-CoV-2 still subject much debate. widely cited *Nature Medicine* publication claimed SARS-CoV-2 likely came nature.

That right key. *have* new normal. countries around world getting back normal normal they've taking virus seriously. Americans decided we'd rather live half-assed socially distanced life suck up, knuckle *hard* 6 months year, able wash hands forever. 

It's discouraging. tired condemned ""new normal"" exist people refuse suck short time. northern hemisphere winter flu season. basically looking ones probably big hemispheres winter. work home, know might reach some, others might useful.

Call main office ask make appt. it’s academic deans, say want talk academics. it’s Student Life deans, say it’s that. Etc. Doesn’t much matter dean type dean — good like counseling college students. 👍

You deserve help. Reach out. I'd say trials vaccine leading FDA approval likely Sputnik V SinoVac vaccine. U.S. going battling virus long time come significant percentage population fucking stupid.. He's saying wearing mask (alone) make immune contracting COVID, totally understand people could interpret broadly. thing Adams; want people thinking let guard wearing mask ""enough"" precaution. I’m gatekeep beer! Don’t drink bud light, aka Mississippi peckerwood piss! Drink local craft beer only!!! worst thing thing panic, extreme panic led extreme defiance virus restrictions.

Divided? Wrong choice words.

As Canadian would say many hopeless animals humans, never got education love whatever. 

Somewhere 15-25% adults would seem. less depending USA. shine bright flashlight Covid. plenty places around world treated like flu, lull first supposed second wave would make seem like disappeared. year honestly wouldn’t mind rogue brick put misery.

Again, Fauci expertise tell us viruses work, authority tell everyone make risk assessment given science. Axiology matters (tautologically), science. I’m server; it’s something I’ve noticed. thanks!  true, doesn’t mean local action can’t work well, certainly isn’t excuse avoid trying. Washington State first state COVID detected USA took early, decisive action that’s lasted longer elsewhere - currently dealing much smaller outbreak states. New England states also finding success, too.

The summer case study localized outbreaks caused lax precautions: first sunbelt states reopened first, Midwest states affected Sturgis, college towns across country classes resume. three entirely preventable, none would required national coordination (although would certainly go long way toward making things possible.) I’m Florida. saw 1,500 cases day I’d probably celebrate good point. Regeneron solid data end month antibody cocktails - well Eli Lilly. Could serious game changer potential bridge effective vaccine.... Cody, honey. what's education? I'm boomer. I'm Gen-X.

so neither MMidden right. am. good right. What's Irish idiots?  Outbreaks. They’re hot right now. eat mask on? It’s possible carefully constructively. 

Not Sweden model perfect, there’s lot learn it. Tipping culture toxic around, illegal imo. Everyone get (and consistent) pay everyone receive service, working job/paying price. won't, they're weak. Requiring quality content never barrier theater business. kind send message probably party hard hospital occupancy hits 100%. textbook prisoner's dilemma.

I'd prefer message either ""escalating measures cases stop increasing"" ""if want take risks can't get treatment, fault"". That’s what’s fucked industry. Cooks, waiters, ushers, etc probably still fine places like provided wear masks, patrons ones screwed. There’s way eat mask on. I'm sure realize terrifyingly high percentage population needs effected herd immunity set in. 

Immune people help, ""minuscule"" realistic unless whole lot people get super board wearing masks staying home real fast.

Nothing would make happier proven wrong though good point. hope public gets message. former armchair, confirm. Remember experts predicted 3,000 deaths day June? 100% fine. give medicine? far know US give anything unless bad enough go hospital. Brazil they'll give everything think might help, vitamins HCQ ivermectin even z pack. mostly bunch trolls trying influence people fence whole thing GAF Thanks financially socially responsible business owner! I’m sure customers happy return it’s time. tried anything parking lot? movie theatre near house it’s big empty open space, seems ideal temporarily host something like swap meet drive covid testing site.

Even DJ food trucks. Outdoors plus masks safe there’s nothing people doesn’t incur risk somehow. wow, movie theatre?! awesome! sorry hear bills wasted sweets. we're allowed travel without quarantining, would love see film there! Probably /r/JusticePorn? Let head make sure.

Edit: confirmed SFW relevant sub mean point three vaccines millions premade doses think really bold thing say sawn bear put yellow triangle building? study offers facts claims shows picture outdoor dining probably responsible few, cases. Exactly lol. far least 24 people infected (tested positive working hotel) entire towns nightlife shut result increased numbers infections. German news sources claim part US military stationed area. Apparently 10 times higher official numbers. getting downvoted? People hate freedom guess. way affirm that

Which country allowing bars nightclubs open, huge parties thrown citizen approved travel EU? There's answer I've found buy boxes N95 respirators online ebay stuff. Strangely, I've found buy single N95 respirators etsy places. Make sure mask NIOSH approved Probably fuck Yeah around spring 2021 probably good estimate. really need vaccinate high risk medical workers effectively end pandemic. Maybe one uncles. Yeah, probably does. 

But matter common is. store set policy see fit. employee b/c they're handy they've always carried one, still company fire them. Hell, at-will employment... fire pretty much reason (other basis protected classes) reason all.

If thinks workplace unsafe, recourse file safety complaint city/state dept labor OSHA depending nature it. entitled ignore violate policy result.

Idk, video site load. works well, especially NYC, everyone sick March. going vaccinated cured November 3? FUCK? FUCKING POLITICAL, IT’S DIRECTLY RELATED VIRUS! 10%. less 10 percent. patients likely represent worst-case scenario. infected people end hospital, Gholamrezanezhad says overall rate intermediate-term lung damage likely much lower — best guess less disease new, one knows yet long-term impacts be. Dad? people selfish Yeah wouldn’t dare say anything would affect tip. Lol! Tipped employees never hound customer anything bc it’s like asking get paid. evidence helped SHIT TON first wave? Many countries without mask wearing saw similar declines. tiny percentage cases first wave traced activities required wear mask (shopping public transport). It’s similar wave. doesn’t seem like makes much difference either way. People fucking jackals airplanes. Heh, indie retail job years back basically told clock going clock rude customer. Europe paid sick leave matter what: doctor deems sick, paid leave. matter new hire budget days per year, based medical decision. That's definitely something US adopt going forward, simply civilized thing have.

Everything else: nope. v
vaccines comes, going back living. like FL TX, spike happens flattens Maybe higher 20%, then. change concept overshoot all. Holy shit, bizarre seeing Reddit. across street happened. Totally insane, dude fucking rage. every day, always great. Total bullshit she’s let go. Exactly. sue hope settle fear juries. lived Tempe, hell think going happen? Seriously asshole. nothing close that. That's thousands dollars difference America. consider bleak too, never said mourn. said stop obsessing. 

It's gunna end sooner rather later. time focus way out, know insist refusing to.  That's good point. Mass vaccination countries developed healthcare infrastructure possible then, though think summer realistic. Even US able distribute fairly quickly, problem healthcare system cost, infrastructure.

Many countries may see single dose years though. turning they're back Fauci turning backs truth.

The truth virus we're much still learning about. Dr. Fauci better idea what's come? Yes. saying disagree Fauci. I'm turning back him. much appreciate explanation stats projections things could go people stop wearing masks. gripe he's adding opinion creating worry future we're still dealing doctor telling cancer, middle chemo treatments doctor walking saying ""hey, we're trying fix cancer, know, may get brain cancer next year...then stomach cancer, lung cancer.""

I 1000% agree weather analogy actually made analogy one comments. SPOT ON. Prepare 15 feet flooding instead 5. agree there.

I never said needs positive. tell us facts. Tell us details. Leave extra crap it. know fall devastating. need narrative positive rosy. frankly, we're working deadly pandemic, need know could ""first many"" pandemics. He's done wonderful job giving us facts walking us numbers mean. Leave extra details out.

I so, so, sorry friends family affected virus hope take comments downplaying virus conspiracies anything sorts. virus much real much dangerous people walks life. *personally* disagree way Fauci handling *a few* comments. Stick data explaining means. tell public enjoy positives. Instead say ""hey, know hopeful saw numbers go New York? infinitely happier take care together."" Maybe mention fact gonna ""age pandemics"" we're fighting toughest time country around world. Mental health serious. Maybe kill 180k less year certainly playing boost headlines increase gravity words. Hospitals still weren’t overcrowded even re-opening.

It’s fine want move goalposts make hospitalizations irrelevant opening let’s pretend keeping hospitals overwhelmed isn’t prompted entire concept locking down. least worse new york decline everybody praising them.   natural resources forced out, one thing harmful.

We losing lot industry overseas Mexican markets. think way 400k (maybe excess deaths) generally going fall/winter would mean people would gather indoors means easier people get infected. flu season come play help either. forget school reopenings too.

I literally found 4 cases 1 minute Google News, might want re-check opinion.

I checked attacks bus drivers btw. Going Drive disrespect towards citizens... fuck lol. Teledildonics irony. I'm yet single anti-masker come intelligent, logical, scientific factual reason wear mask saying *we're* ones diminished mental capacities. 

How feel think smarter majority world, including immunologists virologists, doctors, nurses surgeons? chances getting covid coworkers routinely wear mask nose take masks desks? wear kn95 day minus eating quick snack drinking water. explaining phenomenon that's inconsistent we're seeing. NYC continue drop steeply exceeded HIT issue overshoot 20% threshold. So, whats point? opinion can't rely numbers released. way states lifted restrictions number cases going down. long masks fine right? anticipate 'over'? 

I think spring 2021 rough timeline, vaccine not. think general apathy set around major assemblies, sport events, etc. Perhaps international travel take another year fully resume usual.

I think vaccine come. think reporting change *so much* vaccine, even illogical. envision vaccine elective, lot younger people choosing get it. If/when people get infected, cases really tracked way before.

I guess vaccine give people option make choice themselves. really think entire world fast declare problem 'solved,' even lot people go unvaccinated. suppose depends happened you. lost job home understand exactly would lock took place. If, hand, 4 months fewer shite films pictures, fewer nights shite pubs drinking shite beer, make fewer trips supermarket; think struggling put decent case together say allowed expense guidelines procedures saved countless lives.  liberal. pretend problems, politics make much sense anymore. does.

It would much credible would accept problems try solve efficiently.  understand democracy, government. majority people want mask mandates, gone next election latest think forgot safe word. friends told first Jew met. said didn’t look like Jew.  image Jews people dressed like this. It’s relevant. Maybe you, is. ""all time"", where's dead guy telling us about? turns country 100 cases daily need army tracers.

Stop damn dramatic. difference people China get see Uighurs going normal lives get fake version western media reports I'm explaining overshoot you. get not? article discusses global risk starvation. entirely driven economics, virus directly. Anything set distributed developed countries subject oversight QA/QC standards said countries regardless it’s made. New Covid Cases Soar Denmark article explicitly states:

**""The CDC note touching surface object coronavirus subsequently touching one’s face, mouth, eyes could result infection.""**

Fauci said unlikely, impossible, debunked. You’ve misinformed risk. It’s like severe cold. estimated 1% young people end hospital nearly suffer chronic health problems upon release (see comment sourcing number). don’t really know bad risk kind intermediate / long-term consequences infection young people’s health. understand toll must taking mental health social distancing doesn’t mean social isolation, telephone isn’t new technology! sounds like would benefit seeking virtual counseling mental health professional discuss feelings rather turning risk-taking behavior alleviate whatever negative feelings you’re having.

I encourage try stay objective virus seek positive activity engage daily basis addition seeking mental health assistance. longer let feelings gestate, longer takes get back normal. hope feel less bad soon. It’ll whatever is. I’ll give best, maybe that’s enough, maybe not. Whatever. didn’t say wasn’t deadly. It’s death sentence people it’s time stop acting like is. Shit, even vulnerable age group it’s death sentence. 

I think need wake up. Look numbers, look population, look demographics. It’s serious virus people. Like every fucking virus ever existed, people long term effects.

If you’re happy staying home, keep “living.” I’m sure you’re happy! Yeah, unnerving, I'm damn glad got tested, false negatives aside, nice know sure. threw real data me. One link written ECONOMISTS say proof. ask indoor spread that's clearly biggest danger area. sure that's even relevant Ireland? make up? 

It turns country 100 cases daily need army tracers.

Sorry, US paid time requirement 50 states. someone gets call wanna-be murderer qualms justice handled, think it’s well within reason tell go hell. case, NYC back 1 30% infected? .5mg left that’s year ago, .25 immediate release June, stupid take one see calms things bit wait call Dr? 200k americans dead Chinese data? that's enough reddit today legitimately don’t understand model showing 400,000 deaths end year. would double 3 months death toll year slowest activity period year. think hit 270,000.

We've identified long term effects keep eye on, all. We're also sure long longer term effects last. Months, years, permanent? hard follow. Pericarditis, myocarditis, chronic fatigue different severity recover go worse problems. They're still working whether Covid vascular disease respiratory disease. afraid perfect example. 9/11 created permanent effects, however mostly completely useless - whole airport security theater that, theater, US government agency tried test it, found 95% success rate smuggling guns through. literally nothing prevent another 9/11, makes good business pretending something. fully expect happen ""health measures"" corona. It’s difficult categorise Singapore’s ""outbreak"", saying explosion cases obscures what’s really going on.

The vast majority cases overcrowded foreign worker dorms it’s impossible keep people isolated one another. little spread outside this. instance, yesterday’s numbers show eight cases detected visitors abroad two week isolation period, one case detected general public, forty cases detected foreign worker dorms. That’s pretty typical ratio community spread dorm spread long time.

So yes, one hand, Singapore ""an explosion cases"", hand dorms quarantined, wasn’t something would increase risk everyday life taking public transport, visiting shopping malls, etc. aren’t living foreign worker dorms, chances catching close zero. Granted, foreign workers people too, virus made obvious living arrangements need lot improvement, outbreak within quarantined group people quite different outbreak general public. like stop protests... Someone correct I'm wrong read actual study days ago believe study said tested positive covid-19 twice likely also gone restaurant recently test, going restaurant means twice likely catch covid-19. reputable online colleges hiring 10 men spread families, potentially spread another 10 people etc. 

Yes traced, harder get control. mean supposed do? Instead taking ticket sales, take ticket sales? huge difference going movie theaters ""hiding inside"" asshole would describe hiding inside Smart! one time went movies France packed! France beginning new wave infections? Nope, slim number cases need ventilation, fact moving away ventilation treatment causing harm good instances.

Steroid treatments though found significant effect outcomes. Think one cheap steroid reduced mortality 20% severe cases. Experts differ this, estimates range 30-70%. I'm guessing end year, 10-30% population countries would already exposed this.

I'd love wrong that, according studies India Brazil, third population metros exposed already, antibodies.  heard aunt cousin LaCrosse even student. proves what?
As one read talks going theatre without mask feeling safe.

You 1000 death day, totally insane, western country bad response. UK lockdown nearly strict enough suppress cases level test trace could introduced. wait furlough payments end see afford. Mass redundancies around corner. Every business closes knock effect economy. 

We can't even stop illegal immigrants crossing France, know think quarantine everyone. Care homes death camps right now. least worries. $30 whole family better $80 theatres family 4. guess never went anyehere would make sense install UV lights? fresh air brought building likely free SARS-CoV-2, old air dumped building. Except Obama president 4 years ago. Dude you’re going troll come fresher material. “killing grandma” “muh haircuts” responses pretty weak now. sub new targets like parrot. post photos taste-testing people’s car door handles? Canadian Yellow Vests hand quaint. Originally formed carbon tax, co-opted anti-immigrant members long; devolved bunch redneck racists drove caravan trucks Ottawa. would pointless, 20 minutes way long. People still going get infected close proximity. Bingo! people want face mortality. fear death. Therefore, can’t happen them. say that. emails released. clearly stated would way quickly get herd immunity. hope ready, Trump election win, wants announcement. rollout schedule concern him.

Edit: added ‘ready’ clarify clearly speaking mentally ill person. Unless you’re entertained person’s writhing aimlessly around, might suggest trying convince snail cross busy sidewalk. might make positive difference long run.
This person needs find themself. Maybe lick handrail shopping cart since feel confident. Amazon meatpacking plants? 🤔
Hahahaha ohhhh jungle!!? 🤦🏼‍♂️👍🏼 Oops Bought tickets (jk)

Seriously though, checked reservations selected one fewer seats already taken. 20, scattered 475 seats theater.

Weirdly enough people (France) want get back theaters, eating restaurants, disrespecting social distancing wearing masks anymore problem...   Thank sharing this. many people area saying ""everything covid!"" Drove past bar yesterday. packed. Probably 30 cars full parking lot. middle nowhere 3000 people live. even incorporated town. asked dad bars opened says they've open months. that's guess. kicker 5 new cases county yesterday. fucking dystopian. “Yeah haha dig graves don’t wear masks”

If literally superpower this, would demonized war crime. I’ve watched every single interview Anders Tegnell made said that. Please stop lying need become defensive.
I’m interested life all.
And choose ignore questions completely first place.   lockdown working, stick it. know think can't afford lockdown, pret manger going bust instead year twos time breaking bank us.

Yes would need process quarantine test everyone entering country, difficult expensive certainly impossible. I'd say pretty likely people treat ""all nothing"" scenario.

Germany relatively light lockdown kept masking, etc. even things reopened.

While cases significantly minimum, they're far crisis levels. Italy's lockdown tougher, managed easing restrictions gradually.

Spain, France, etc., went super-strict almost lockdown overnight people basically stopped taking precautions, wearing masks, etc.

If people go tight lockdown gradual reopening universal, accepted protective measures, still see rising case numbers way endangers hospital systems already high risk. 

If get degree voluntary compliance allows people meet limited capacity, engaging super high-risk activities, much better concerned; I'm far convinced Sweden got right beginning, health testing infrastructure improve, model looks sustainable effective long term - unless anyone go complete elimination (which means closing borders neighbours successfully eliminated). Restaurants open governments putting profits health... ironic since countries worse numbers going worse off. Good dumbass id give jail time it. Young people dying much much lower rate elderly. stupid post man. Loving I’m neophyte 2800 cases day doubling period 7.7 days R value closer 2 1, I’d suggest it’s well underway.. point discussion really draw line waves? really matter stop case? nothing riots/protests happened there. they're actively killing them? someone obese, accept higher risk death want die.

Say you’ve traveled some. 10 men meeting regularly, maintaining distancing, anything outside context, seems relatively low risk (no worse workplace).

The risk get random groups 10 meeting reasons, mixing groups 10, maintaining distancing. 

Would made sense draft specific exemption, like workplaces, rather standard meetings. problem lot people simply support service businesses pretend like COVID-19 real, many people *never* go back businesses. ""business blacklist"" head businesses prior COVID-19. much, much longer now, I've see little regard businesses customers. make employees work fever right interact maskless customers, give shit customers, ""I give shit customers"" likely permeates whole business. I'm going back businesses, ever. They've permanently hamstrung themselves. lot think happens people able ensure they'd nearly empty? VT reasonable people. I’ve times work absolutely love it. think CDC asked State County officials weeks ago get ready.
Are going deliberately slow roll vaccine rollout? Think practicalities that: lockdown completely disappeared would stricter lockdown European country ever had. Even then, might get *national* R nought low enough stop local outbreaks spread lockdown lifted. can't even afford another lockdown.

Even get rid community transmission, quarantine everybody coming country. tough possible (though long-term) New Zealand absolutely impossible majority countries rely heavily trade (which them)

In this, good weakest link. security guards guard quarantine low wage probably rigorous.  Well Well would sit without mask full capacity?
Is would feel neighbor coughs? 4,000 detected - roughly equivalent per capita 10k per day Florida summer.

Election november, even biden wins (and god better) take office jan 20. confident make matters much better, (a) take time (b) political situation going extremely ugly there's decent chance republican governors going follow federal guidance. second point, governors ones formal power take measures like shut down, feds provide guidance, influence incentives (tie compliance federal funds) areas federal power (presumably things like air travel, etc).

Biden going able save spring break... also individual level, stay smart safe. 

I planing survive, loved ones too, far, good chances, working home, bf go office, know cases soon explode, government issued recomendation tomorrow Serbs come back vacation Friday. basically means 100k people comming back, every third could estimates (families get exposed, one got it, would spread even easily situations like those). So, hope would send back home soon, whole office gets it, 30 there, need 1. Please look definition free Wikipedia. Specifically part able something “unimpeded”.

The government enforces laws consequences (which talking about) also impediment! 

For example could try open restaurant could get arrested. maybe board up/weld doors (see China). would also argue large fines also restrict free fine impedes ability operate restaurant profitably. endorse vaccine conspiracy en masse yet. They'll say labs holding back making vaccine make Trump look bad.

Anyone smart enough accept vaccine continue take precautions. $dollar mad businesses might want ""back normal"" immediately. fact governments rushing large scale studies shows much public health policy dictated pharmaceutical industry. opportunity make money going allow common treatments get way that. Public health officials failed every step way. possible virus either mutated less deadly strain, say confidence threat seasonal nature? ask simply reports subsequent waves virus Europe recent weeks, particularly countries loosened quarantine restrictions general public, seen return horrific situation hospitals across Europe early Spring, viral videos depicted overflowing ICUs, patients trolleys hospital corridors, shortages body bags kinds utterly terrifying grim situations related extremely high rate serious illness death COVID infections.

It appears time, least now, virus spreading widely rapidly since beginning summer *not* correlated marked increase hospitalisations serious illness. mean virus mutated strain less likely cause serious symptoms, severity seasonal nature difference severity related fact still warm parts Europe, another explanation disparity? many deaths comfortable causing take mask off? comfortable. would anyone even want take off? Seniors, healthcare workers vulnerable get first. General public see spring. Yeah, yeah, completely agree you. following u/sark666's arguments try turn around. Probably, knowing way treat teachers. Classic whataboutism. It’s still nice out, people choose sit outside vs go inside. 
Nassau county upticks- significant often upwards steady decline. dip case labor day weekend likely much testing took place. understand it, 150 200 placebo group test positive, number compared number vax group. number 75/100 less, 50% greater efficiency enough FDA.

FWIW expect vax group much, much lower that. Hypothetically, possible repurpose phone assembly factories make vaccines? Surely world need another 30 million iphones next year. Yea, that's keep going back believe masks, social distancing, etc help. argue science want can't deny results. need 100% effective return normal. People go back normal take risk shot. Anyone thinking people wearing masks still time next year deluded. waves supposed die entirely.

Yes living 2 BR home sucks some, lived happily 1 BR. adjust.  Bruh, ever say lockdown doomsday anything? 


It amazes y'all went war thousand dead literally brush thousands infected every day (with evidence long term damage young older patients mild symptoms) 200k dead within 6 months y'all bitching enough people dying flu killed less 3 months ago. 


For country literally sucks dick patriotic every citizen matters blah blah blah, guys really showing true colors. good news is, could complete overhaul country leadership then. Obviously can’t un-ring COVID bell, it’s already rung, least could somebody charge isn’t actively inhibiting relief efforts genuinely believes experts. Except know HAL from. He's US/Canada. 

I'm confused sticking metric accent needing identify town grew in. fact know voice Canada/US eliminates 96.2% world's surface area 95.2% world's population, and. that's crude estimate saying Canadians Americans speak English way, which, even OP admits, definitely case. Yeah don’t get fear mongering random internet experts vaccine development. listen true experts saying, they’re concerned safety. flu many preventable causes death. 

Why ok deaths? don’t take zero tolerance approach causes death? mean less you? Could also impacted fact many tests ""self administered"". assume accuracy would take hit already 30-50% false negative rate. Sweden nothing brag compared Latvia. 6 feet apart thing April 2020. virus airborn. floats air. builds air enclosed spaces. people take masks eat. Canadians much better. easy, possibly even helpful demonize strawman that's guilty selfishness else.

My 84 year old grandmother selling house, moving home.

She friends, lost friends COVID, knows whats going on, actively seeking move deathtrap.

.. invited whole family one last lunch house. Christmas grandmas usually 40 people packed 1000sq ft bungalo.

So took note family members went (All ones go church.. Go figure), know stay hell away from. there’s lot data coming that’s showing actually dangerous virus young people.

i think numbers looked way lockdowns, working home, schools/universities closed.

i think it’s somewhere 10-20% young people admitted ICU - *if they’re hospitalized*

i also saw third big 10 athletes contracted covid developed temporary heart inflammation [Projected +200,000 COVID-19 deaths USA September binary choice ""Let medically vulnerable die healthy thrive"" ""Everyone healthy doomed get lockdown depression."" things mitigate psychological/emotional impact prolonged pandemic. don’t think intention article say flu shot would make immune Covid-19. point prevent increase hospitalizations since respiratory diseases lead events. almost closing close contact businesses wearing masks actually something. everything opening back prematurely again, time welcome back COVID weeks time fall. Humans much, much stupider us thought. Earth ypu telling can't benefit pushing price woth news one knows cintroling moment ypu would release bad ones?

I work broker, fun. know numbers, even pre-pandemic, Canada filming location movies shows already. remember specifically seeing headlines new Batman film moving production there, know TV show *The Expanse* filmed Toronto. mention great Canadian tv shows like *Letterkenny* *Kim's Convenience.* Beyond that, look up.

Actually here's link shows already film Toronto. Umbrella Academy surprised me: isn’t death. long term harm Covid-19 Indoor dining open CT ghost town inside everywhere.

[CDC study recently found new cases twice likely eaten confirmed COVID-19 twice likely dined restaurant 14 days becoming sick tested negative, according CDC's Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report issued Thursday.  patients also likely report going bar coffee shop analysis limited without close contact with people known coronavirus.  Oh we’re convo continually, “wtf happening south us?!?” 50 days left stop :) decide. still tourism travels time? demonizing Sweden months locking down

Yeah, Sweden locking resulted one highest deaths per capita. want it’s clear data right

How right? plenty countries lock still much actually locked socially distant due culture”

That's actually said? praising Sweden's model, completely disingenuous act like countries reopened similar restrictions lock down.

It's also correct false narrative restrictions Sweden. clearly are: things like size limits public events/gatherings, mandatory social distancing guidelines restaurants/bars, work home recommendations travel bans outside EU goes show strict lockdowns, like Israel suggesting here, way approach this.

Nope, there's plenty evidence show lock downs help contain outbreak pre-emptively prevent getting control. NYC good example former NZ latter.

For talk lock downs, idea posters like conveniently ignore Sweden actually good look numbers. They're still seeing triple digit cases daily one highest cases/deaths per capita. Contrast NZ's numbers whose economy projected grow much May 14, New Zealand moved Level 2, enjoyed freedoms Swedes. Even now, two-thirds population operates less strict environment Sweden. fact, since February 28, New Zealand reported first case Covid-19, spent time laxer measures Sweden IMF predicts Sweden's GDP fall 6.8 percent year increase 5.2 percent next. comparison, New Zealand's GDP expected fall 7.2 percent year rise 5.9 percent next - although projection made prior move Level 2 nationally Level 3 Auckland last shove false narrative Swedes living 'normally' elsewhere. lol - I'm aware. Ok. Nobody believes that, even believes you’re serious point Concluding Paragraphs:

 

Is targeted treatment reducing deaths disease continues sweep around world? resurgence COVID-19 cases levels least high pandemic first struck spring, USA, France, Spain, followed comparable increase deaths, people requiring admission hospital. Thus, treatment alone cannot responsible saving lives. Possible explanations recent disparity cases deaths include widespread testing, meaning number cases detected closer true burden infection, whereas accuracy counting deaths remains unchanged; lower viral load point transmission, hence less severe disease, non-pharmaceutical measures mask wearing; changes distribution cases towards younger age groups. [Data show recently cases fairly evenly distributed across ages 20 years upwards, last 2 weeks August cases people aged 20–39 ten times number aged 70 more. Risk COVID-19 death young people tiny compared elderly. However, cases young might yet spill older people, long-term consequences non-fatal disease unknown.

Whatever reasons apparent declining mortality, impact drug treatments COVID-19 pandemic still limited. massive research effort needs bear fruit broader range effective therapies. talking circles. already addressed point laws. already said didn’t think bad thing. 

Obviously consequences actions. fuck difference make infectious not? still harming others potentially killing since covid matter..... saying? Like said hypocrite Again, want call respect, that's fine. That's different word thing. ""fear"" many causes death, avoid certain activities behaviors would increase odds dying causes. 

For example, smoke, try eat well exercise. drive car lot safety features. take medications prescribed. yearly check ups. electronics near bathtub. go dangerous parts town late night. swim shark-infested waters. play golf thunderstorm. 

And find risky situation anyway, yes, afraid, try remove situation. Like recently car accident (was fine safe car) get ride much less careful Uber driver less safe car. know it’s flu flu still deadly virus vaccine. similar sense (well COVID vaccine approved)

So ask again, Covid zero tolerance flu causes death prevented arent? Covid death worse flu death? Can't blame honestly. imagine news:

""Don't mind 0.5% IFR, translates into, 1 200 dead, 3 permanently severely damaged, aroun 20 damaged lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, nervous system lower sperm count, vaccine soon, even it, reach sooner 6 months unless privliged good privliged see goes. roughly 20 people 100, lets stay lower end. means 20 families affected, 20 people unable work, 1 die, unless hospitals full. case, 3 end dying, knows many die getting treatments, die catching hospital cancer sth. Oh yes, kids spared little asymptomatic super spreaders can't forced wear masks keep school work. Unless trully able isolate 2-5 years, rich, sorry, house actually morgage, sorry, can't work long term concequences, take it. conclude, drink bleach morons wear masks, enough dictors really get stupid."" want america bad way better kids.

Edit: always figured ever going move id better treated know english... Tell it. friend (we're living southeast asia) christian, mormons still tried convert told christian... Holidays going tough year. many people going break quarantine, they'll think okay holidays. Broaden news sources. went Britain, would able tell North America? Probably yes. accent. accent may less localized widespread, making seem like ""neutral English"", accent. we’ll open dorms in-person classes put thousands students faculty risk god forbid, SPRING BREAK!! Good, people infected quicker bullshit ends.

&amp;#x200B;

Quarantines flatten curve, never end virus, cant stopped, theres scientific basis assumption. Look happened digress depression. Life expectancy went UP!

All loss mention better killing even one person. true, many actually are? 👏🏻👏🏻 happens someone tests positive? told stay home? taken sort isolation center? people anti science?

They stupid understand it, hate  trend Europe shitload positive cases rise, deaths anymore?  Doctors pledged heal ill people studies. Words works. Hence doctors using dexamethasone (30% less deaths ICU?), vitamin (20x less likely die ICU vitamin hammer), know else.

&amp;#x200B;

Also nobody west ran numbers likely die Covid-19 people treated since years HCQ. I'm pretty sure studies shall come going brutal. Every single time someone said: ""people already HCQ hardly ever die Covid-19"" media kept answering: ""HCQ work treatement"".

&amp;#x200B;

The media circus fear dodging question: ""where deaths Europe?"" able last long.

&amp;#x200B;

The level manipulation politicians media insane unsustainable. end doctors science win. article makes several claims think current evidence Children 18 younger get infected coronavirus, rarely makes ill -  \- transmission child adult appears rare 

Those bold claims points suspected true, evidence get, less true look.

It's kind half-assed thinking keeping kids home. school officials media can't keep information Covid19, risk sending family environment? people making decisions qualified.

My 2nd grader's school case among staff first week. email home full information cleaning surfaces. Hello, floats goddamn air! Cleaning surfaces May 2020.

Lockdown seem sensible country like India. It’s going CFR. Every country going high percentage population infected. Thank non-histrionic logical post. never leveled curve daily new cases increasing 22 states. It’s gone rural America death rate going back up. Let’s open schools time said anything leaving house 5 years?

Is me, worse everyone thinks looking rate transmission? NY state currently, drilling example Erie county RT important numbers stand much started comparing:

- Dry Nose (id like think due smoking)
- Sometimes face feels warm, working finding thermometer, get hot flashes cause anxiety 
- Insomia time high, gotten rest. 
- breathing feels fine. said, sadly daily heavy smoker breathing course 6 months pandemic it’s gotten worse cause consistently smoked much more. It’s never bad, effects heavy daily usage felt. 
- exercise, severe social anxiety going outside difficult. 

I know many symptoms coming Xanax anxiety disorder itself, everyone see I’m coming regards Covid-19? body feeling worrying it’s noticeable, feeling “high” smoke, dry nose new maybe causing congestion, mucus cough bit brown/orange. It’s concerning. 

Maybe I’m panic attack, I’d really appreciate thoughtful input here. Naturally, scared schedule test. around people super accepting Covid, they’re hopeful everything okay. It’s worrisome. 

Anyways, appreciate anyone read willing offer advice Ah ok yes important reminder! Though probably better safe sorry.

It's tough situation (not specific one w friend overall decision making around COVID)- like base decision making scientific research much possible, though research somewhat known elements still much totally known. Also, county health director resigned end Board Supervisor's meeting ended restrictions. 


Why would someone position resign good job? ""It money"" Well great, windows classroom open anyway.

The one thing going AC pulls directly outside air wall attached venting rooms building. risk mitigation. like canceling spring break one thing holding everything together, easy way minimize inherent risk. Stockholm’s antibody rate (17%) London (17%) less NYC (20.8%). London‘s 7 days average cases 250-300. NYC’s 230. can’t find Stockholm’s new cases specifically Sweden’s 7 day average like 170.

Hmm....20% plus universal mask wearing=control? same. people dont really get happens you. Oh good I’m gonna change whole approach staying safe based things “probably fine” “some situations”. Retail needs Union representation. Thats unjust firing would never happened. Trump made virus political, US got this. Someone tried convince Covid treatments suppressed protect Fauci's ego, namely ones Trump touted. Outright egregious

the kindest thing that's said Trump admin (well, decent sane people) I'm trusting mr. Tofu King. think highest risk activity practice, even without anyone wearing masks known spreading event gym training facility switzerland since reopened May, one wearing masks. think masks bad, go packed gym would either wear mask reconsider I'm lucky go well ventilated place people. hand plenty spreading events restaurants bars/clubs. happened 2 months ago misinformation going around.

Hospitalization data goes whitehouse case numbers. WhiteHouse took numbers first place many errors local officials. contributions include ‘Probable’ cases  think actually wise decision. systems reported fully weekend less staff weekends. 

I see Germany since pandemic begun. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday Friday ""huge"" numbers. drop Saturday, Sunday Monday. Media picked can't take articles seriously headline reads: Cases dropped 700 again. real, numbers bull 1.8k cases Thursday.

I think, 7-day average would even better. Got me. Congrats. Poe’s law finest, amirite? worry. leader already holding maskless/indoor rallys again. We'll 0 cases April 20\_ \_.

Let's alienate making dig graves. could go wrong....  Meanwhile school district saying shut schools positive cases. want ""anyone less six feet away individual 15 minutes more"" quarantine. told us rush conclusion positive case contracted school.

They're worried close school causing outbreak. U.S. adults say would get COVID-19 vaccine one became available,

That halves length queue get vaccine :) telling people worry masks fell listening ears. gone away rest world? impression countries still concerned it, especially top scientific officials. American election change outlook covid. Denmark others currently surging still right. can't suppress virus completely, unless remote, wealthy island nation like Iceland New Zealand. spread push cases time. Denmark others did, absolutely saved lives. likely end rate cases Sweden function biology virus, nothing else. Trump administration suppressing data, assure lot kids died that.

Lol. Ignore data like. kids haven’t school time

They still community, live parents go work every day. tons infections, died. also ignoring long term effects.
 
Long term effects child lucky enough survive virus, rest lives lived constant pain agony due heavy damage internal children get die permanently don’t want you?

You definitely troll Anti-lockdown Anti-masks two different things. Anti-mask crowd small, least 2 groups Anti-lockdown Anti-mask:

1. People going lose job/business. people, prefer risking death low probability fucking others rather dying hunger. understand large wage gap Israel is, expensive live working Tech/Army/Connections.
2. People believe lockdown political. Israel elections 3 times row, prime minister accused several crimes done several shady things ""to fight Coronavirus"", example, closing courts, leaving rest country open. many people, among them, believe government acting help people make sure prime minister judged. saying need curfew, saying could done 2 months ago would much less severe. However, government chosen wait 4000 cases month it. believe might reason it, although admittedly, also possible bunch idiots. “Moving on” virus genocide. don’t strictly lock vaccine thoroughly tested gets released, distributed, waited upon make sure works, sentencing tens millions death potentially billions lifelong disfigurement internal organs. No. even accepted review journal. 

At point, read vanity publication. people anti science?

And unlike previous cults, self-terminate localized way, Kool-Aid, self-terminate viruses climate change taking everyone around them, too. go up.

explain? defending need want? crisis, wants unnecessary. pardon trying lighten mood little, I'd heard joke related province forgive telling it: 


A Canadian travels Australia, visits bar small town. local (sitting friends) sees 'new guy' walks over, ""Hi there! I've seen town before, might from, mate?"" 
The Canadian says, ""Saskatoon, Saskatchewan!"" 
The Aussie, smiles politely, says thanks, walks back friends... friends ask, ""So, where's guy from?"" 
""I know, sure speak English there!""

Central government fucked giving powers state govts. 

I suppose that's key difference then. 

All Pakistan's provinces (except Sindh) worked directly federal government fighting pandemic. dont even know happen school reopens. people actually obeying social distancing rules. Every body weres mask here. dont even know cases going up. 

It's great hear everyone's wearing masks obeying social distancing rules. 

India's got second highest population world. Honestly, I'm surprised cases rising. 

Think way.. Relative India's population, guys handled much better many countries. hows press freedom Pakistan? Especially foreign media? 

Honestly, know feel it. 

Journalists associated select media outlets, particularly DAWN Geo, tend complain restrictions media increased following PTI's electoral win. Others however disagree entirely got mixed bag. 

Maybe they're right.. Maybe aren't? knows certain.. 

As foreign media, think ever many curbs Pakistan. thing think military wanted restrictions Deewa Radio program run Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (US government-funded organisation). literal US propaganda imo trust anything indian media says Pakistan vice-versa.

Well, that's great hear lol. 

I've misfortune hearing Indian media outlets say Pakistan believe me, really hurts thinking many Indians actually believe stuff. 

Just give example, clip YouTube Indian journalist going (clearly photoshopped) picture General Bajwa eating pyaz roti journalist basically saying Pakistan brink starvation even top-ranking officials nothing eat. Like.. Seriously? fuck kind story even lmao... 

Another one recall aftermath Pakistan's 2018 elections involved Times journalist talking Imran Khan planning coalition government Hafeez Saeed one biggest lies I've heard. 

There unfortunately many examples well. Hopefully retail employees armed protect anti-mask trash Southwest west coast, I'm taking abrasive it, course keep ascent descent etc otherwise they're pretty chill mid flight. Good...I see nothing wrong here. Yep. *still* federal-level mask mandate fines this. know there's world outside America right? everything revolves around Trump. 
Like said wanna hang bunker like Trump go it. rest WORLD move  I'm gonna hazard guess two respiratory illnesses time would bad Ministry interfering Hogwarts. know numbers record set three days ago.  Denmark lockdown too.  Arrogant ignorant. intelligence understand what's going that's vulnerable.

Pretty dumb Bloomberg think September non existing lockdown would help us.

It's like think still drunk five months party ""but sober now, drank nothing!""

Anyway, handled. Århus Odense cases down, stuff works. Again, happened human experienced severe adverse effect commonly associated vaccines, secret due data protection noone knows is, possible rule vaccine days?

I sincerely asking that. Median, Mean, Mode considered “averaging” descriptive statistics. Nice try. right choose isn’t right kill someone else isn’t making choice. car 100% vegan, better worse, example vegan buying car would opt car without leather, possible: car since public transportation general better enviroment, live city, really need one. would never fault anyone getting car ""vegan-friendly"" car. remember ""as far practicably possible""

We test like entire school found one case sonetines also teachers. think lot hidden illness.

We free tests easy accessible, people get tested lot.

Anyway. schools cause spread, spread would started openef sick would parents, teachers, pupils. happen.

The spread happened 4-5 months school reopening, people getting covid college students. So. ain't schools.

This goes DK, IDK othet European countries. We're probably top efficient stopping spread schools. regular top 3 comparisons efficiency stuff Europe. It’s good thing said wear fucking mask...so there’s that...  Yes totally agree. People stupid trusted truth. Anything less view pure idealism. People need told need know fearful disease, nothing more. point understand protests. told wear red shirt type person would wear color shirt wear choice refuse let anyone take away me. matter favorite shirt happens red. alot people like me. Someone mentioned like wear seatbelt. Well, believe anyone wear seatbelt. think able make choices includes right make bad ones - choice affects you.

Where wearing mask becomes different affects people's health, own. wearing mask becomes like obeying traffic laws. freedom go red light choice affects people. customer's problem. dining restaurant right *I cannot afford get sick.* risk dining great relative benefit may get it. get takeout tip well. do. specific. Conservatives don’t care. Yet less covid deaths countries ban people going outside....strange wearing mask March, leaving house march. anything. would love trial, I'm wfh, live alone, next never close people pointless. reason, go back person work, would look it, public transportation commute work public. would complete 180 lifestyle.

Reddit: 

fUcK ChYnA!!! hOpE dIE!!! 

Sincerely, good guys.

r/coronavirus mods: *getting RSI modding thread.* never said rates....i said total cases. Chicago leading total cases. colder weather effecting transmission rate here? owns corporation. experience, tests widely available past month two. Prior that, given symptomatic people contact confirmed cases. fact, local testing facility *apparently* ran tests last week many drive ups. covid shot? 45 thousand people die year second hand smoking indonesia...thats people dont even smoke exsposed it.....you dont see police tackling smokers streets forcing fines labor them?.... 
covid deaths indonesia even half number.....you guys busy snitching neighbor wearing piece cloth new research actually says outside sun fresh air reduce risk getting covid.... Literally insane, far all. Fall winter going bleak, dark lonely United States. Again, body different doesn’t mean mine same. Since know someone feels? know don’t also something else going on? don’t. I’m happy breathe fine. wish could. Bloomington, Indiana, Greek houses 80% infection rates. Indiana one lowest compliance states. wait supposed get die?

Sorry, humor tends dark past days. number cases important number Chicago leading Illinois cases far hence covid epicenter Illinois. Show many people died this. surely isn’t many Covid-19. Lol, think runs WB? It’s roomful random people convinced one way another director. Seconded. Americans, ~~whenever allowed travel~~ welcome back country! ~~again~~ Please, continue feel shy talking us English. unlikely anyone give guff it, likely person help out, least remedial English, speak slowly, loudly clearly. Difficult say, I'm expert course. lot producers made arrangements many different EU countries waiving liabilities etc. would decrees pressure pharmaceutical companies 'skip'/'rush' full testing fase primary outcomes achieved. 

But know specifics neither Pfizer EU countries. 

And liabilities safety, per se. Afaik get one EU country fully approve it; becomes available whole EU market. medicine safety regulations quite streamlined within EU.

But second difficulty would pharmaceutical companies. Despite waiving liabilities etc, business case models traditionally would use base decisions on, still require safety data; would presume. Going blind probs big no-no lawyers/consultants econometric people within company.

It would/could well possible company eagerly gives political pressure now, could find well dire straits later on. decisions held information available time, without current political pressure; people might happy rushed things. Politics fickle promises made might turn solid; Especially politicians power... type people would travel area control viral disease high probability killing based demographic, also ones isolate return home. happened March snowbirds told come home, stop anywhere back country. Grocery store parking lots small border towns full RVs province plates snowbirds stopped shop, despite orders. hate break you, nobody outside sub gives shit Dr. Doom says. Personally think it’s really rich people, bottom vaccine pecking order, say things like “I’m going rush get vaccine right away. people go first.”

Yeah... that’s exactly what’s going happen... Ok. Wow high. bet new York positive case numbers huge margin. think infants breathe better...but cool comparison. classrooms rearanged fewer students, sometimes outside summer. Kids simply contagious asymptomatic, harder control. reasons too, remove parties, weddings list vectors. Embedd [Text] (link) without space two.

But without full stop them. Yes, do. Oh wow....higher thought.....lol. Fake human  Ah not-so-subtle “you’re parents suck didn’t teach 3 languages 2 completely useless” subtle brag post. FDA mouthpiece Trump.

There nearly enough data confirm vaccine safe effective trial months. Pfizer even fully seated yet.

I'm waiting approved Europe. Good points. get Florida would discussions still state. said states interest also never hear all. addition others suggested would make sure vitamin deficiency. seems like studies come lately people deficiency twice likely test postive. Obviously cure least can't hurt make sure getting proper nutrients. Yep, tons people wearing masks pulled down, especially people working. Yeah wouldn’t say pushing websites misleading information wise Well no. Read article. schools open since beginning april. open 4-5 months spread. Hence cannot reason spread.

The problem big social arrangements adults. Funerals, weddings, birhdays, parties. Plus bars nightlife.

What happened increase people carefull, much social arrangements. This! part time, volunteer sign language interpreter. masks clear plastic window game changer. article site BS. article another article pay read, sources shown. entire site science denial site commenters linked oage clearly science deniers. articles site include things like ""covid 19 FEMA camps"" ""polio outbreak due vaccine"" Masks never said 100 percent effective. Wearing one capture exhaust prevent virtual load. regions lockdown, prevent access outside. requires cooperation areas lockdown... speculation order released. order quite short Secretary Agriculture shall take appropriate action section ensure meat poultry processors continue operations consistent guidance operations jointly issued CDC OSHA.

Can’t wait. Honestly, California one weirdest responses covid, seems like changed policy like 10x. troll stop talking bots/agents big time. downvoting anything negative China upvoting anything negative US.  know super angry hypocricy around it. left choice. Woohoo! Virus done! Think outside ~~box~~ casket... collect donations funeral services!  There’s 2 questions ask lower testing numbers blamed stuff: 1- numbers lower, tests basically accessible wanted them? (As spread slows number people taking tests) 2- population still want tests?  disturbing trend I’m hearing US schools opening people avoiding tests go business well contribute metrics trigger shutting schools down. Democrats want pass large bill, lot stuff.

Republicans want pass much smaller bill, less stuff. understand that, reason bring son (who autistic) reading comment struggled understand sarcastic comment. told confident people struggle pick consider obvious sarcasm. 

Thanks clarifying Since I've moved ~10 years ago, seems like Wisconsin essentially Texas North (that actually offended someone joked once). also take pride drinking like states it. 

When stay-at-home got lifted, people proud rush bars crowds. local university back session drive student houses morning see aftermath huge party.

And that's even going mask mandate, riots, protests, etc. Yes deaths country. death rate still likely projecting higher reality. 
They essential workers too, afzer article 2 meat factories 200 dead got 20k fines, easily replace ""desposable"" rather ""essential"". would absolutely call cops parents held party violation executive order Exactly like americans march, like infinite idiot's cycle. reddit circlejerking. safe Israel see colourful graph Trump pulled out? totally proves USA done testing poor messaging sure, get logic?

NO! ""get logic"" government worker lying people, especially lie killed people. trusted figure lied masks effective. said medical workers needed N95s surgical masks (I agree getting PPEs), instead LYING public discouraging mask use, said wear home made masks (which eventually anyway). early days reduction Rt would made major difference. live one states rampant lying. roll over? Maybe family risk back then? Well know lot people got sick back Fauci blame that. 

I disagree securing PPEs medical workers, disagree leaving public completely unprotected TO. believed earlier public handle truth behave accordingly, protecting utopian thing mind. Honestly, think started talking TV 3/4 suffer long term effects hospitalized, data mild cases together study waiting peer review irrevirsible damage heart tissue cells. 

I started following 23.01. pretty sure February airborne, course Trump knew too, everyone means sth did. knew following Princess cruiser, knew sure. China knew it, spraying streets welding doors. Trump said, 5 x deadly worst flu. Flu also H1N1, swine, avian etc. like hope you’re trolling Everything ridiculous watch quickly sell  Citizens illegals shit unpalatable we'll need amendments undo reconstruction ones since made Fed's job protecting rights citizens inside state laws state passes. Personally think left place. number infections rise Denmark tests incredibly many people, positivity rate stays around .7 % number hospitalisation increased 1 Sep 1st (and 4-6 days around Sep 1st) 50 today: funny! know: happy moonshine, hillbilly sort funny /s Explain wrote ignorant. get banned.

Which know, something cutting man's tongue like say. admits it. woman said attacked customer, called police, violent customer heard authorities notified, turned attack her. That’s pulled small pocket knife pepper spray.

From corporate's point view, employee pulled weapon work, fired. part story matters. none use mice, petri dishes, statistics? 

Peer review obviously standard, people lie too? California Oregon thing wildfires. Yesterdsy said long lasting today said short lasting wtf going hear people shouting “boycott” every thing days. Boycotts work great right, can’t think many successful boycotts. need large group people previously shopping stop shopping extended period time *with specific demand*. 

Not shouldn’t anyway, there’s rarely enough people willing inconvenience much make difference. efficient moving money certain people.

When talk systems, clear goals. Unfortunately I'll go work, think would smart go. want put anyone risk Western countries taking notes! first two weeks supposed flatten curve. Leave humans able handle things moderation allow people let decide risk tolerances themselves. shouldn’t calculate risk based news anecdotes shared reddit spent first 18 years life multiple northeast schools built 1950s. None systems blew air heat turned on.

I understand saying generally true. I'm saying can't make assumption shittily (improperly?) maintained systems 1950s. aren't. Vaccines developing fast countries restricted covid's spread success stories. sick old became disposable, 6 months since really kicked off. placing bets surging cold flu season begins, people northern hemisphere go indoors more, shut windows gather enclosed spaces. likely coronavirus begin spread rapidly way people change behaviour. behaved socially distanced summer might work way winter. basing previous pandemics seasonal coronaviruses get active come autumn headlines RuSsIa ColLuSiOn, gives shit?

The Federal Government Constitutional Authority mandate 3/4s shit anyway irrelevant--praising Chinese Government laughable, ""BuT US bAd"" whataboutism. negative feedback sub? it? FL TX significantly highs. would require type federal response :P Kettle. Black. turns scientists able update new information confronted evidence. However, normal US constituents okay people knowing everything even though know little themselves. raised kind religion says know everything absolute sense. Mobile data shows people changed behavior. Many people switched working home, large events canceled, etc. 

The lack government mandate made peak higher longer comparable country, like nothing.  Bingo. saying along. Barking people something might get comply, mean they're going right.

Aside that, mask wearing town first months plenty people busy working to, know, feed families pay essentials.

Somehow bodies piling up. Almost masks effect already stable situation... ever said perfect? ""happens time""?

Nope, one guy killed? Also, Nope. times extreme thing get through. like German people taken camps see bodies Jews Nazis treated Jews. Yes, sad true. Go Covid positive subreddit say lol bubble. I've already banned muted even though already wrote leaving echo chamber. Huh? Experts, literal mechanism body releases inflammatory cytokines response virus, similar SARS? understand body's physiological response that's mean. guys know vaccine? article say wish could implement USA Well yeah, stopped knocked cases down. Would pointless keep afterwards really.

I think worked good many Danes actually govt. recommends. 

I think many countries lockdown constant private socializing partying period, less effect.  member military, subject German jurisdiction, would trialed military court.

At least case US / British soldiers got pub brawls. Threatening police nothing, experienced bar owners threatened call MP. That's faces went pale stopped fighting. Maybe fine could progressive; is, could based person's income wealth. sit use bathroom, close lid flushing. wipe surfaces regularly, wash hands often, wear masks common areas.

Which fine me. isn’t black argue people time I’m supposed serve people food unless wearing mask didn’t give someone food didn’t wear mask written suspended without pay I’m white number got floated lot spring summer total cases much 20x higher detected due lack testing, mild symptoms, etc. that's true, given current confirmed cases US, we're actually 40% population it. would pretty fucking amazing 80% cases end asymptotic barely cold. correct  people say sound like self-serving, self-righteous automatons bark like seal command rather acting think themselves.

But come instead throwing stones echo chamber. would honest thing do? Britain screwed, Tory half wits charge, REAL disaster stalking land, Tory govt job, long shot.

Why ads I'm presented suck bad?

SecretLabs start advertising purchased $600 chair. start getting mattress ads purchased one end last year, even though shopping comparing online three months. chair. use Razer peripherals gaming get advertised new products come out. static ads see various websites seem disjointed irrelevant usually. make sense, they're already late I'm going buy another chair another mattress. They're long-term purchases. wearing mask pretty messed given current circumstances. reading post history. Seems possible.  Yeah got 2 3 comments deleted pretty much discernible reason day, political reasons supposedly.

Oh well. roll it. you’re talking “seasonal coronavirus” common cold, yes, know immunity common cold fleeting, parent attest. pretty stupid inconsiderate coworker. know long interaction (how many minutes, far person, inside, far apart person rest day)? Also, day family gathering? I'd say wearing mask good, brief interaction &lt; 5 minutes good, especially distance. family gather weekend, even get sick might early contagious. TIL wikipedia news-worthy Ah, see another hour elapsed, needed posted again. places want ordinary employees going around enforcing masking. Leave store security supposedly trained situations. ending

Okay d00mer evacuation order prohibiting right gather, that's difference. I'm saying like they're waits change it, that's courts job. simply rule Constitutional (in case) Congress States make Amendment address issue disagree (the President get vote Constitution). Yes

Staying alive bills think main problem everything done home living emergency situation. wfh means isolated, apartment like far everything, person suffering major depression (so pass one call person room sometimes starts cry apparent reason), isolated co-workers, feeling stuck work, wondering future career prospects without possibility networking (which something hate). really would love experience wfh like fanatics posting pictures LinkedIn sunlight mirroring laptop fancy coffee mug. unfortunately don't. According online survey 1000 people asked, got ya. article mentions propose testing student every three weeks. sound sufficient, especially established community spread. Meanwhile lockdowns _clearly_ worked well everywhere right. Right?

The point is: either squash altogether (like China, NZ), manage keep low (South Korea perhaps Nordic Europe) end Sweden's level fatalities (as Spain, France, Italy US)

Given US clearly unable squash altogether bring near zero, Sweden's path seem like far better There's lot propaganda pushing Sweden's strategy big business wants people back jobs,

Big businesses? think, people would rather jobs rather them. thought through, you? Meanwhile, might also want think extended lockdowns society... Hint: human cost gigantic US context really think comes AFTER. I'm dumping use vitim D, saying 100% fact proven beneficial covid pure nonsense.

My point simple... can't pick choose rights inalienable going claim protection constitution 110% applicable times. Either freedoms exceptions make sense. Let's use heads here. actually read it, skim it? Cause, Every big box retailer assure you. went numb left side body last time got flu vaccine. worst passed within hours, traces lingered months. paralysis weakness though. 

Doctors A&amp;E stumped, thought maybe mild egg allergy (probably eat mounds eggs). reaction lateral myelitis obviously, evidently something affected sensation nerves side, seems like could similar. Thanks posting reply gave food thought What's wrong either? People accept attacked. literally shitloads elderly people tour busses coming Midwest fall. It’s nuts! two cases, either Pomezia Institute lying AstraZeneca reel leaving press interviews going Employ attendants pilots, ground crews, shop workers, ect? think unemployment bad now, let markets free enjoy happens (hint, won’t, economy giant house cards propped central banks governments). 

As free market person, could easily make argument strongest should
Survive let fail. It’s like children. let experience negative consequences won’t learn. 

 issue case companies aren’t failing market forces. companies, specifically airlines movie theaters, failing government policies. mandate lockdowns quarantine periods, caused problem. government shouldn’t forcibly CAUSING bankruptcies. happened. didn’t make poor choice manage business well. got screwed over. That’s makes different. Here's ones ordering: ordered last 8/11 price $7, $3.66... take 3 weeks arrive PNW China. time ordered received differently manufactured mask different vendor, passed water / blow test though. 

I ordered backup masks case suck, turns right.

edit: ordered 6 packages new price, fingers crossed they're still legit! want assess risk level work, try helps, controlled asthma considered particularly big risk factor. cell single data point absolute cascade data aggregate. also plenty people depressed due seeing many people (perhaps even friends family) ignorant, acting selfishly. Even within governments telling people sacrifice health lives parents grandparents value stocks increase. absolutely reasons isolation depressed right now. yeah, it’s unjust, weapon it’s policy Thanks Mommy, Daddy! smart use resource! young healthy go meeting friendsno problem, serious healthy 40. went times take care stuff, see relatives really miss me, I'm introvert problem staying home going visit relatives/friends stuff totally fine long med-high risk group. agree people face punishment wearing mask, digging graves?. fine something guy, im frustrated leaderships handled this, could totally said despair, theres deeper motive.

but agree next year better, guy lashing [NY US strategy stopped ""emergency"" long time ago PA.
 
The entire premise prevent healthcare system overwhelmed - never came close PA.
 
You can't continue emergency powers erode personal liberties equal protections indefinitely. dude, resident weeb someone used hide scarring permanent hair removal sessions wore masks WAY COVID-19 sans issue, let alone black woman. Also tons people worn North every winter wind blowing face sucks. *extraordinarily* effective. think facebook got worth billions?

Browse item site? Dynamic display retargeting audience. Bought yarn michaels September last year? Well, letting know time buy yarn again! saw added item basket check out! Click complete purchase! 

This stuff worth fortune, that's big data big. There's whole companies exist solely match data points individual creates sell companies advertisers. 

And ads delivered countess ways. I've cut customer segments direct mail email, work platforms serve display ads, google PLAs, Waze, Facebook, Snapchat, Pinterest, TikTok, Site takeovers, influencers, tracking people respond hit ads designed coach sales funnel.

And works extremely well. That's actually interesting question. consider population incautious people separate population cautious people relatively quickly reach decent amount immunity incautious best catch it. we'll way fewer wandering around spreading rest us. Almost typhoid mary got vaccinated.

(Sub let call Richard heads) one denying modern day holocaust. get it. There’s vaccine. wouldn’t hold breath either. *Resident Evil intensifies* got anything everything extra little bit completely fire right now? going correct spelling precedent...

But realized works. president precedent. top 10 deaths per capita yet cause excess mortality 2015. how? Nah, NY NJ beginning state ordering care facilities accept covid patients ready not.  

Read long article saturday WSJ.  tells story covid NY.  tried post got deleted named politician... 

Maybe someone find outside paywall.   I'll post link No, even things, highly volatile, fragile, critically ill patients dynamic, unstable vitals. don’t tolerate movement, can’t tolerate prone well — heart rates drop, sats drop, BP drops, things cause alarm. You’ve got manage sedation, assess constantly, monitor neuro status, reflexes, mean patients truly sickest ICU. Give best prone team zero patients still can’t control vitals patients body can’t tolerate it. puts lot stress body.

But, yeah, pretty cool beds. line management isn’t bad get everything set up, it’s keeping neat that’s difficult. put vent tube top, patients head. Lead cables side. tape hell peripheral lines lose IV, especially central lines, chest tubes sides. flip patients back assessments top part bed lifts right access, working quickly key. haven’t managed anyone covid, I’m sure major differences not. Found Mainer.  Greed wins regardless leadership.
Big cooperations like Exxon Chevron puppet Masters. think attacked Iraq? overthrow dictator? No. Oil threatened needed pump value companies like ratheon.
So America like Germany Canada going happen, long machine pulls strings. friend used repair work company rhymes Schlarbucks drove company van. kept table leg van brandish someone got road rage bumper-to-bumper traffic, got car, approached him. guy big enjoys telling story quickly guy turned around got van, brandishing table leg, told guy get back car.

now there's reason table leg company vehicle figured something obviously weapon better obvious weapon. distinction could matter police pulled noticed it. Exactly. again, systems actual power instead claim responsibility INDIVIDUALS affect systematic change. petty flexes dubious authoritarianism see now. They'll close parks beaches try filling skate parks sand. They'll want punish individuals instead actual work. get whole group loud, useful idiots preening ""trust experts science!"" kneejerk reaction. Americans call ""The customer always right"" action? federal rules States make own. person point life driving drunk, threat society need get road. Sure, may get altercation police die, better killing others incapable operation ton metal moving high speeds.  Except victim got fired case smh I'm surprised Supreme Court weighed yet.... state can't pandemic settled now.... I'd agree you, several others could reasonably disagree us well. 330 Million people spread 3.8 million square miles, there's way we'll get everyone agree, compromise, even culture. That's courts right rule Constitutionality.

We also factor things like riding/falling cases support citizens. Lack support citizens can't work due limits gatherings means they'll probably violate restrictions work anyway. that's everyone Washington. 

Watched Jake Tapper rip House Democrat fact Democrats control House. compromise Senate get anything terms support. something still better nothing. Democracy built debate compromise, House Senate seem interested philosophical debates actually getting anything done people. well respected publication prevent political attitudes creeping editiorial content.   Would ""transparency"" stuff thing Trump president?  think so.   

And AstroZenica release information issue lack transparency.  author jumped gun. bike? always find funny conspiracy ridden party always ones committing conspiracies.

It's like homophobic members party turn gay.

It's like ones always trying find way game system everyone like fuck talking about, come shit.

It's always like

Socialist:
""we make fair transparent proper civilian oversight conspiracies can't exist hard pull off!""

American politics mass media:
""She's witch, burn her!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" average American zero science training. tell difference H2O H2O2. showing pandemic. Brazil deaths = 619 per million (8th worst World)

US deaths = 600 per million (10th worst World)

&amp;#x200B;

Except one 1st world country. 3rd world country. Thanks, wish luck get fed “enter neighbourhood”.  Honestly though, administration. enough naysayers, anti-maskers, conspiracy nuts, etc. even productive informed administration probably able eradicate thing.

Drastically reduce lives lost economic impact long term, yes. goal still flatten curve. Keep numbers low reasonably possible vaccine available. give vaccine seems close available?   Well ya go! They'd nothing hide! can't municipality give fines shut business? states know power. Depending state could absolutely sue employer racial descrimination. Yeah. honest too. scouring net info specific reasons hard find.

My guess hit hard beginning started take seriously quicker states. measures taking implemented states.

Alas, fear states (especially fly ones) hit worse due horrors plague medical care (insurance, pre existing comorbities, etc). Mmmmm misunderstand risk higher tolerance perhaps unfortunate combination attitudes wish good luck  read article, that’s exactly implies. probably ask authors notes. beautiful example short term benefits vs long term benefits. You’d willing give years long term liberty posterity short term creature comforts. It’s quite sad, really. it’s authoritarian regimes come power easily. Question - mother old left house since March 12th. told signed flu shot. father left house occasion n95 on, sleep separate bedrooms. putting risk going get flu shot staying home? going continue stay home probably entire flu season, even going get flu? can't fire them, they're essential. 

Or front line expendable? lack funding, staff, technology, detailed guidance, etc execute largest vaccination campaign history.

Maybe I'm missing something, already place?

Each year run huge flu vaccine campaigns require vaccinations kids going school. healthcare employers also run yearly vaccination staff many patients. know employers could. 

Why use resources longer three months flu? would argue administration Yeah... there’s gonna second wave notion that's case primarily know answer already? curious. guess Americans stubborn wont seek comply medical advice. Patient: “Should sign Phase 3 trial Moderna given history adverse reactions certain medications?”

Dr. Henry: “It’s probably fine!” experts

All them. There's reason nobody ever listens *all* advice doctors give regarding health. did, life would fucking miserable endlessly jumping preposterous hoops. alienate normal society. 

To clear, I'm saying ignore doctors advice. everyone cost/benefit analysis advice they're given related health lifestyle. always tradeoffs always sacrifices. Wait 100% tested secure vaccin trustworthy company, take vaccine. google AstraZeneca lawsuits.  called pharmacist, didn’t seem concerned didn’t mention concern symptoms describing taking. recommended immediate release well. dumb didn’t take lol, always making wrong decision. guess feel slightly better? Idk I’m worried seizure thing now. smaller I’d like think won’t matter much. 

I’m okay “not feeling right” days, long doesn’t turn something worse. call new psychiatrist shall see get anywhere that.  K. I'm fan empire pretend CCP ""serves"" people level brainwashing seldom encounter.  fun getting welded home.

Nobody said CCP serves people. CCP obvious reasons rational entities would - avoid damaging country draws power wealth from.

In case, orgy bashing CCP, suppose go back remembering little Western government (particular British American) care citizens. Western governments screw citizens leave die gruesomely pnademic, sad little plebs put accept reality. go check many comments made stating anything scientifically proven, links, sounds bad, get downvoted. Someone business writting comments calm people down. poster either bot gets paid post trash comments subreddit. gone, almost zero risk. virus mostly spread people talking room, case studies suggest possible get infected ""leftover air"" (the case study might happened Hunan mini- bus study, retracted unknown reasons.)

If going room time, use  estimate risk level. England ever get first wave? Seems they're trail US. time, people respond. Conversion rates typically low, costs revenue high. 

If costs $1000 run ads google day, need 10 people make $100 purchases order break even. conversion rate 1% reach 100,000 day, 1,000 conversions. take lot order make lot long enough people want product. articles obvious times it’s borderline inane isn’t wrong this. virus part died down. Infections decreasing day, deaths gone down, places reopening, economy rebuilding, people come consensus virus deadly 99.9% people. reason lot places still lockdown government officials want politicize virus help chances winning election. virus serious anymore. way confirm compare RNA virus original infection one current infection. time impossible since original swabs usually gone might resources sequence RNA. SARS repeatedly leaked labs inside outside China that's interesting idea. I'm NJ school required start online time, weeks might try reopen keep online learning optional. I'm pretty sure going close within month teachers classmates seem optimistic. guess spend time Imperial County flying patients overwhelmed ? reputable news source non Five Eye nation leads people get complacent numbers rise again. Wash, rinse, repeat. Yeah totally get that. effective treatments etc. don’t think I’ll waiting. anymore. one washing groceries letting kids see friends. can’t lock forever. I’m tired seeing 10 year old cry she’s lonely can’t see friends. can’t beat ‘em, join em! Shit like par course retail 

And fast food. ever ever ever defend yourself, die. want tarnish corporate image. subreddit likes parade thought us living sort Walking Dead scenario world ending. Like said, companies look numbers go ""huh, good PR increase coronavirus vaccines"". government step in, lol. imagine go "" well know let's collectively sit thumbs ass"" hillarious lol. tool end? fun fact, ""the customer always right"" supposed mean businesses tell customers want. sell widgets customers, general, want widget pink sell pink competitor come along sells pink widget.

the interpretation forgives shitty customer behavior bastardization. ‘may’ Oh like utter dismissal president amping months? Even admitting he’s downplaying it. Since look crystal ball tell what’s going happen Trump wins again? narrative forecasting scenario ? Private property, right restrict employees customers carry in. 2021 covid might worse, climate change ensure everything else worse, good scientific evidence back up. Vaccination.

And time human immune system adapt it, everyone exposed growing it'll common cold.

But no, able save ARDS patients, next decade (by time human immune system ultimately solved problem), antivirals inherently difficult. good antivirals flu. HIV took decades.

The major changes reducing fatality rate also due MATH+ protocols venting many people using steriods suppress cytokine bradykinin storming. date antivirals moved needle anywhere near much people hoped. Thank suggestion. I’ll take there. 🙂 Common cold mostly rhinoviruses. Immunity short common colds per year unlucky since many varioius strains viruses cause it. first thing popped jead crazy backpack Death Stranding. Could imagine? lol  Paywall :(

I followed thoroughly ongoing. bf work market analysts sister lives SG, Serbia, followed since January closely. clear knew IFR higher swine H1N1 flu, airborne nothing flu. tried call warn peolle back February, everyone laughed, telling go lockdowns, bought N95 masks, 20 normal, thorouh person, people around know read serbian media told crazy. Long story short, Trump knew it, Cuomo knew it, Merkel, Putin, everyone. know knew still think sth kills 1 200. lazy response, seem implying Cummins hoaxer?

Cummins main points follows:
- initial models (upon cost-benefit lockdown calculations made) wildly inaccurate (by factor 15x)
- Lockdowns really achieve anything (lockdown non-lockdown countries largely indistinguishable

- virus much seasonal expected (or discussed) 

- epidemic largely run course Europe. massive surge ""cases"" translating hospitalisations deaths. posits type testing, testing giving us wrong signals causing us undertake wrong measures. (showing thing happened H1N1 Swine flu

- 2020 total excess mortality step years last 40. 
Now, dismiss ""it worked people social distanced"", that's fundamentally unfair. Cummins attack social distancing. attacks lockdowns. points lockdowns seem done much, compares didn't. 

Lockdowns caused massive amount social economic even health harms, made sense Covid Case Fatality rate estimated 3-4%. 50+ studies showing CFR covid 0.2% - 0.3%. (If less 70years old CFR 0.05%). Note, thing happened H1N1
[Please insert ""s0 wANT oLD peOpLe DIE!"" comment response numbers]

In country, lockdowns cost (to date) $87 Billion dollars economic loss (and harms). prevent harms? may never know, surely helps analysing decision compare country lockdowns? countrty excess death rate indistinguishable, year last 40, ask questions, no?

I'd interested take graph... social distancing work? look like virus largely run course, also better source. hate BBC popular press vs primary literature.

I found paper BBC referenced though looks really well source 17 percent according bottom source sampled thousand people geographic area whereas source found sampled 100k. Larger generally better, seems like pretty big difference me.


Also note recent survey less 17 percent, declining 29 14.8 week 22.


I'm guessing 17 percent fucked somehow. original paper said accessed source June, since adjusted false positives whatever.

but that's bit speculation part. tried earlier year. Look turned out. Campgrounds, parks, shopping, offices opened long time. 

Indoor dining activities closed (open am), places opened outdoors. encourages grown-ass adults act like toddlers disgusts me. What? No. know Portapotties are. plastic, mobile versions outhouses. I’m talking permanent structures built ground. small building toilet doesn’t flush, drops large hole ground. sure live still Oregon western states least. lot hiking camping (usually 3-4 nights week) see almost every week know? Maybe sometimes casual sex lead connection. know cunt would waited plane actually take off, take again.  business owners trying make living.

Edit: employees. Spoiler alert! They’re probably wearing masks. let go two reasons. first one supposed enforce statewide mask mandate, second knife violated company’s no-tolerance weapons policy. Aid spokesman Chris Savarese told Insider statement: “For many reasons, no-tolerance policy specific associates bringing weapons facilities weapons person. primary reason keep associates, customers, communities safe, mitigate escalation situation.” Where's evidence seat belts work - maybe reduced deaths dumb luck people would lived anyway. ? dont doubt it. guess think people lot smarter really are. ad-block pretty much anywhere manage. marketing emails Amazon others go straight spam folder. place know see ads TV, can't block them. 

Marketing seems, doesnt work people know need, want product it. E.g. couple days needed USB switch quickly switch mouse keyboard desktop laptop. searched amazon, ordered product fit need reasonable cost. guess opposite would seeing bunch ads happen find something useful think ""Damn, really need that!"" (Even though really bought saw it) governor impeached now? I'm sure super difficult. Jokes US can't second wave first one never ends. Take that, elitist doctors! determined months ago. relevant say much. get regardless blood type effects severity time.  

There quite diseases way. ""A blood"" slightly higher chance serious infection.... ""O blood slightly lower chance. barely relevant total motility rate primarily comes preexisting conditions. 

23andme trying remain relevant... they're not. coronavirus? told would kill ONE US. ""a few"" hundred. 60k. 

Who told virus kill anyone USA?

Thx friend! **really** want airlines share no-mask-no-fly lists. Wish lived do. anecdotal evidence completely contradicts you. work place 50% employees literally STILL think virus actually exist story created make Donald Trump look bad. still closeted conservatives getting caught sucking. crowd agree party line outs.

Maya Angelou said? someone shows are, believe first time. someone track record trying sow panic, says withheld critical information keep people panicking, tell bad intent.

**The number acute food insecure people at-risk countries could increase estimated 149 million pre-COVID-19 270 million** end year life-saving assistance provided urgently.

Recent estimates also suggest **6,000 children could die every day** preventable causes next six months result pandemic-related disruptions essential health nutrition services.** Kind sound like need go therapy cope little better. both, friend. I’m downvoting someone’s ignorance :) Worst President ever Depending define lockdown, NZ second reduce alert levels 
[11 Aug 2020: Moving levels  
* Auckland (city/metro area) went [alert level 
* Rest country went [alert level 

[14 Sep 2020: Government next review Alert Levels Monday 21 September.  agreed, principle, move: 

* New Zealand Alert Level 1  
* Auckland Alert Level 2 eased restrictions gatherings. 

**Israel's** bit stricter NZs level 2, appears similar NZ level 3

The new(2nd) Israeli lockdown:  measures announced extensive imposed Israel since first lockdown, ran late March early May, include: 

* 10 people meet indoors groups 20 allowed outdoors
* Schools shopping centres close, Israelis must stay within 500 metres homes exception travelling workplaces
* Non-governmental offices businesses stay open must accept customers
* However supermarkets pharmacies remain open public. Where;'s data back up? cops let illegal brothels operate wasn’t pandemic?  small minority Americans right thing right thing.

Then right thing afraid getting caught. literally words comment... data back “realism”? know difference know. aparently don't. lessons learned stuff others already could've told rushed reopen. Shame kill bunch people learn them. Numbers starting rise Utah. wouldn’t surprised cases college towns smaller communities schools opening start rising. Post deleted CCP-affiliated mods 3,2,1... know looking amazon masks! many though, idea ones work ok ones don't... ask ones bought? Positivity rate one thing, compare total population state, it’s another.

An increasing positivity rate bad, regardless look it, it’s one thing you’re comparing Wyoming New York. Okay since lets hear side story.  say full .... known issues manifest visibly till November, problem him. Fauci never said ""masks help you."" said, ""people need get masks continue life normal, need stay home."" panicking early days simply enough masks adequate caliber healthcare professionals, recommending average American go buy mask would guaranteed would none available foreseeable Ok, remember I’m one championing cruel unusual punishments. there's lot asymptomatic people younger generations, also lot people said lots times, deaths gonna spike time positive tests, death follow it'll later.

Basically one/not enough cares anymore get contact someone infected, get tested. dentist appointment? Get tested. want travel ? Get tested. Etcetera etcetera. Lol could pulled pen defense company would used excuse fire her. Corporations like rite aid give fuck employees. “The meddling, first reported Politico, included efforts stop publication report last week use hydroxychloroquine, malaria drug often touted Trump, delay 10-state study COVID-19 infection statistics June another spread coronavirus Georgia sleep-away camp.”

Apparently there’s lot “didn’t know” including article even talking about. Trump politicizing scientific publications entire worlds medical organizations use standard done decades many cases.

But yeah sure 200k big deal let’s sneezing contest church ok?? Highest prevalence London (13.0% [12.3,  think garbage? give specific examples? That’s really universally true. 

North Carolina law wearing masks books. pass temporary exemption pandemic. Imagine able go outside freely without wear mask, go huge concerts pool parties, bars &amp; nightclubs open without restriction, part crowd sporting event, teacher children go school without getting infected &amp; getting tested whenever want. no, perpetual first wave thousand people dying day free! People need jobs country. Hire people en masse produce many vaccine shots possible. seeing crazy disparities hyper compliant lax areas can't attributed factors.

There incredibly lax area densely populated. know exactly would happen. happened back March. Trump administration slowing testing, proudly proclaiming that’s they’re doing. suggesting way stop anti-maskers removing head destroying brains? Agreed. think he’s serious he’s replying like way is.

Calgary, BC, GTA, places US sound vastly different. way talk, tones, pitches, words, different really appreciate difference US customers dealt versus Canadian clients deal with.  Thats N95 masks. CDC gave us list manufacturers passed quality inspection. blind faith. list still available online. numbers remotely realistic. Like, even vaccine expect cases far future. 3 times? Woah. Yea really feel people trying stay safe there. Strange world TJ Maxx yesterday loudspeaker said customers required wear mask ""unless health condition prevents so"". I'm like what's point then, people make something. shopping again. Aye.... come in? Unless... 13.0 percent. 

This pre-published mid August. I’ve taken woodworking, tool restoration, reupholstery, watch modding, built legos, interior design, automotive stuff.

Nothing works. second put comes back. Sure. inject petaflops protect myself? want one mirror effect. look like robocop sonething. Meanwhile .20 cent face mask would effective Lofl. K. I'm fan empire pretend CCP ""serves"" people level brainwashing seldom encounter.

Have fun getting welded home. right. Still, we're six months this, we're still plugging along. see people rightly worried rushed vaccine, can't agree risk free test great accuracy better guessing? 

Exactly, think governors say: WH gone nuts. people state need me. Feds coming help, may coming hurt. I'm going power protect people economy state.  yep. plus people USA dont like told do...that compounds problem. think that's true older children, youngest reliant socialization tenant education, online learning total disaster. difficult get engage without children physically present; early learning really need hands-on. aunt kindergarten teacher nearly 22 years. ready retirement, meant victory lap, sorts. cries day every day now. workload quadrupled kids barely hanging on. person learning necessarily better reasons mentioned, 4-7 age bracket, good answers.

My local school district decided start year online first 5-6 weeks reassess, despite less 1% positive test rate, seems like online learning continue 2021. Part thinks age group take year off. 5 year-old, would personally hold back entirely. mean look taxes keep implementing. Take city decided increase Police budget year alone tens millions dollars. Again, lot local governments regardless party affiliation incompetent suck governing sure know pretend things nice dandy. 

This cautionary tale give evidence stay elected needs go. mayor needs go. blame Trump, federal government etc. wants failed bad managing local level. lockdown since April. five months ago. get mine Amazon, 50 $7 I’m laughing lungs out. tried make sense comment, dawned upon me. 

We Sweden often make jokes non-Europeans can’t distinguish Sweden Switzerland. 

Here’s quick guide:
* Sweden: IKEA, blondes, rather social democratic far north
* Switzerland: Watches, chocolate, shady banking situated alps Central Europe 

It’s easy, know. US putting rooms different mass production lab. Valid Well regular chap posting quote Reddit im sure know would called - word HE'S STAND COMEDIAN ANYONE SEE THIS?! /s  really though. were, would understandable. isn't, know hurt people could care less. much eviler ignorant. *crosses fingers* Please work....I need get nightmare. agree first part, can't push future forever, eventually social economic cost strict lockdown become high **he admitted mistake apologized**

No wonder cult 45 despise him... them, apologizing somehow sign weakness. Speaking Canadian, sorry that's bullshit. reddit. dont expect people read constitution. Lol 6 feet apart average NYC restaurant fit like 3 people Spanish flu actually mutated contagious form, reaching smallest Pacific islands. Definitely. get worse Winter like endemic coronavirus.

I personally doubt lockdown measures actually much, though. seeing crazy disparities hyper compliant lax areas can't attributed factors.  Great analogy, you’re genius man. begins. Personally, since they're adults see time outside school buildings institutions problem. 


However, personal views aside, private colleges successfully reopened - found at/hosting party, public without mask, etc. students immediately expelled seems suitable deterrent. Technocracy time Toblerone rescue!  Better guilty potentially ill dead, transmitting virus one family members asymptomatic transmission causing ill dead.

6+ months pandemic people still asking appropriate attend 100 person weddings, unbelievable. Especially considering mentioned family high risk category. Admittedly, something right least asking first go, ultimately, care health, family friends, humble opinion hold ""scientists"" invented nuclear bomb. saying. basically choosing leader based charisma. important attribute, important one?

Not necessarily, populace uninformed, like that. Hence, Democracy requires informed populace function properly something sorely lacking world days.

Not monarchist myself, somewhat sympathize derisive attitude enlightened monarchs 18th century towards democracy. Especially education mostly upper class privilege, understandable Catherine Great found absurd delegate administrative decisions average people. school started last week. Shouldn’t wait weeks see plays first? possible yes. could also mutate become worse. However, starts killing people quickly makes people really sick can't go spread it, eventually it'll burn out.

Most likely case long term mutation less serious strain passes around easily kill host make ill can't spread cause they're stuck home bed. think getting voted mainly due wording question. 

Its one thing cancel major event/concert/professional sports game anything education related effecting entire ""ecosystem"". college kids actually young adults, maybe may children need plan around things like this... plus faculty children's care schedule - things would require major last minute adjustments planned well ahead time. decline! *hits* gong! Grasshopper, time leave. don’t say... party believes Earth 40000 years old shit woman came rib man, meddling science? report employer mishandling possitve employee.

Employee left sick sept 4th tested possitve sometime.later back work today.

How report this?

Its day care dangerous everyone.   Trump would tell great wall stopping zombies. Nothing article states community service district head wanted put people work. Where’s community service? It’s community head zealous praised Reddit it’s anti maskers. 

What thinks anti maskers shamed society ? 

Or separated camps? 

Would support that? clearly endorse forced labour community head he’s low grave diggers.


The Jews dug graves camps. yin make anti maskers dig “ quarantine camps “ fine costs less following rules, guess one they'll choose everytime. like whole world seen China did, people like refuse believe works. kids right die much everyone else they're afraid yell rooftops /s China's PCR test capacity almost 4 million day. get used there's outbreak, rest assured number test ran per day still million.

Also, they're detecting imported cases tests run? Somehow, sub sane sub right reddit. I’d agree - I’m statistician, seems like way people infected right age groups, less deaths overall. I'll stick with, ""Yeah, fool once...""  response nothing OP said. WTF? regurgitating irrelevant talking points. media needs people come tv since everyone watching craving updates, ideally something new say... bolder better. 

Throw letters name sorta relevant realm enough credibility make pitch. use panel it’s opinion instead suggested fact that’s reality 24 hour news cycle funded ads.  Yes it’s serious question. Younger people dying getting long term damage reducing people work places like grocery stores banks ability spread would benefit elderly too. Oh please. Like think one tell american accent. Yeah, fewer cases ever would zero cases, genius. We're nowhere near zero cases.

What kinds stupid interpretation that? many people want spend rest lives wearing masks public. Idiots: need government tell do.

Me: Yes. Yes do.  reasons less deadly nothing strains. with: 

- learned virus developed better treatment approaches hospitalized patients. 

- public much better educated protect themselves.

- much better job protecting people vulnerable serious outcomes. 

- Masks social distancing, exceptions, fairly widespread. Compare March. It’s night day. 

- Large public gatherings virtually non-existent. 

- large percentage people working home. go people much tolerance restrictions. people older health restrictions continue abide restrictions, people already started things get back normal like visiting friends without mask going gym Same. stepping first, F that!! There's really dark shit going testing monkeys. Check Harry Harlow weird psych tests 60s, devolving pure evil ""pit despair"" rape rack among things. 

Maybe even worse doctor whose lab installs port things skulls monkeys bars inserted prevent moving tortured. backlash stopped like decade, moved China continue evil work. awful.  guys Melbourne totally fucked stuck Andrews reverses tact gets booted out. target benchmarks unrealistic society balances risk human welfare. Right Victoria wants eliminate risk, impossible impractical unethical society large. actions police state absolutely appalling complete travesty democratic values principles. rest Australia almost eliminated virus, yes us agree pretty tough achieve! pricing residents terms power Tenet awesome. absolutely loved it. Would recommend watch can. Robert Pattinson talented actor. Whatever floats boat, man.  Indonesian here. People like refused wear mask one reasons COVID-19 cases resurge here. asked, answer, ""What? Social distancing over, right?"" over. Heck, capital city, cases provinces, pretty much closed since yesterday way lockdown.

I agree punishment. punished somehow. city there's fine wearing mask public. sounds like good chrismas gift Uncle Sam everyone states. Love ammonia malfunctioning outhouse smell 19 confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday. know community service is? putting camps. Digging Graves gravesite concentration camp? People actually jobs smh

Literally comparing teaching anti-maskers lesson holocaust holy fuck I've seen all.  TLDR: 10 new imported cases, 0 new domestic case, 39 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

😢 Anti-mask protests happening world wide  See mean? don’t think it’s real. I’m telling 300 new cases little ass town today either think that’s true doesn’t matter, dangers virus “overblown” whatever.

You’ll probably “but many people died” answer three. three covid deaths today. That’s three many. Every one people died alone drowning sloughed body fluids, maybe one got lucky heart failure. real families.

But know, matter tell you, still think virus overblown. think Eddie Izzard, talking louder louder it. One basketball coach come US test positive nanjing, quarantine end 3 weeks ago 3 negative result before. case made 10 school closed student got home quarantine. believe government put 'imported case' category found anonther local case related him...... Oh, definitely know meant her! also under-the-nose/pull-the-mask-down-to-chat person.  stop posting every time company’s CEO comes positive statement vaccine potentially make millions dollars? need convince politicians shut country many people refuse vaccine get sick. learned nothing pandemic? Even flu stayed home too. Ah see. thinking one readily available time.  PSA learning opportunity, highly recommend everyone question motives tactics poster. tactics used trolls. challenging view, expect:

-	intentional muddying waters. See claims decontextualization, see putting words mouth never addressing it. one possible point confusion part clarified.
-	name calling
-	drops attempts addressing point legitimately challenged provided evidence contrary. 

Engage facts disengage reaches point.

To prevent malicious editing, original context know people fatigued months. know lot people heart problems.

And questionable poster’s response: flu exact thing, whether subreddit accepts not, vast, vast majority cases, effects temporary. Interesting. 


I guess want bodies present tourist sites, otherwise it'd make sense pay tourism-related businesses financial losses brought pandemic. worry, US live see second wave.  Community service?   Bruh, community service. like fines thing, wearing mask crime. Give 10 hours community service. Stop exaggerated slavery crap   literally say anything there's one contradict you. military ruled state tightly control access foreign observers, journalists organisations. believe lie selling get country.  literally says go theaters WITHOUT MASKS piece. probably go masks much earlier that. promoting fear-mongering, misery porn headline? Yes no.

An “outhouse” isn’t flushable toilet like you’d find modern house. Think along lines [portable (aka “porta potty”) that’s fixed structure directly connected septic tank. plumbing. fell toilet (god forbid) you’d sitting giant tank shit piss toilet paper.

I’m guessing they’re referring outhouses built along hiking trails, sometimes called “latrines”. Sadly, there's ""0"" missing. Oh gotcha. Well vaccine always risk see trump uses Reddit well Twitter, posted Russians.  Treatment emergency room stays free US.

Treatments mean shit 30000+

Yet poor workers get sick die due lack insurance muddle cuz medicare socialism Amazon paid 1.4% net income taxes last year. murder unborn trolling im biggest. full body autonomy it? can't pro abortion also want force vaccines others. it? people choice body not? And? Covid spread anywhere gets opportunity spread. includes parties also restaurants, bars, shops, trains, buses. winter coming.........

At Least summer nice weather gotten out. Honestly? anxiety doesn’t help. piece furniture broke thought “IKEA shouldn’t worse hardware store, freight shipping expensive AF. It’s massive, fuck goes ikea, cafeteria isn’t even open!” Thought would quick out. not. packed, people massive clumps, shortcuts shut keep flow one direction (even though must one cared) result way end.

Had worst panic attack life. Alternating hyperventilating breathing 45 minutes desperately tried get meandering labyrinth one way arrows, way go whole way end. dizzy. hands feet fire high oxygenation. chest burning intermittent bursts breathing minute 5 minutes. memory it’s blur, like drunk everything woozy.

I got car drive sobbed another half hour. would paid amount money experience that. I’ve experienced seriously fucked shit, yet god damn Scandinavian particleboard vendor scariest experience life.

It doesn’t feel safe go anywhere. mathematically, staying inside safer. lot essential workers died. It’s stupid think people who’s lives risk job deserve first line. Hope works. Omg can’t read, cheers you! read part. calling pathetic y'all discipline keep up. Eh, quite: it'd like hiring artistic consultants tell hope find artist paint mural, hiring artist... without going fully competitive bidding process. (The metaphor breaks bit.) 
But McKinsey recipient billions OP referring to. going affect credibility American institutions

You speak tense seems suggesting credibility institutions *already* gone shit this. Retaliation would take time. willing report risk future retaliation needs tell lots people, many can't ignored. Maybe include fear retaliation message. 
I problem head HR working similar plan, never took action problem fixed itself. possible reuse N95 masks, example baking short time. CDC good entire life. look Lyme disease see insanity goes there. 99% doctors believing non-sense 300+ studies going contrary 8 cited, outdated studies blindly followed MDs. pretty insane break medical system decisions made ""thought leaders"" MDs arrogantly blindly parrot ""findings"" corrupt inept, historically. hate say it, scientist wants people safe regarding COVID follow guidelines, CDC inept corrupt since Reagan. always holistic approach dealing pandemic. can’t downplay negative effects example lockdown. epidemiologists take every aspect seriously. Thats decide best approach possible. OP implied things burn time get close 20% (noting 17% beginning slow down). U.S. south disproven notion. nearly enough data confirm vaccine safe effective trial months.

We're currently second month Phase 3. Reagan lot shitty things. LOT. 2019 issue fault supply chain taking month longer decide flu strain going recommend analysing southern hemisphere winter outbreaks. cause issue nasal spray made AstraZeneca time manufacture enough outpace demand. usual time decision issue.

The injection form flu vaccine short supply thats given 2-11 year olds normally. 

Basically I'm trying say supply getting vaccination reliant UK government time getting future coronavirus vaccination public issue dosages avaliable. like virus schedule. Like, ""I'll stay days I'll way"". work like that. people stop taking precautions, it'll start spreading again. I’d guess isn’t meant

He’s country’s top public health expert. shouldn’t give free pass unclear comms. mean, everyone think going happen WH circumvented CDC's reporting function public? many questions. 

Why scheming get flu shots, view? isn’t surface explanation adequate? getting flu shot? know CDC doesn’t?  *The death one man tragedy, death 1,000,000 statistic* So...these outhouses, they're permanent structures holes ground underneath? that's outhouse really exist anymore.


How many people naive simple vocabulary? Yup, teachers glorified baby sitters parents get angry perfect little timmy gets bad grade. Hope make maintain graves too. really depends whether people listen not. People colleges refusing get tested, refusing comply contact tracing. want ""snitch"" 🤦‍♂️ young people know afraid simply testing positive actually sick. connection? sides say exactly other.. sigh. Ontario first wave passed getting ready second wave Careful now. Dangerous folks like around here.  😂 Instead providing proper PPE workers, Trump force meat factories open sign executive order prevents workers suing factories covid-related damages?  true. small blip there, went w whole it’s big spike. one good, don’t think convince hardcore denier. I’m exact boat you. :( Broken cancelled semester...it’s rough I’m starting see light end tunnel reject everything say due one thing, hear you. part massive shortages, partially due Kushner restricting National Stockpile could award contracts cronies experience making PPE make super expensive unusable versions stuff. publicly available stuff, gets drowned next day scandal. shit like would Democrat prison would Fox News 30+ years political context, GOP another day get see results end October.

That mean definitely saying works, know yet.

It means able see numbers determine whether works. cell phones use. cell phones track everywhere concerned then, well, might well one. Big box stores use biometric data cameras scattered throughout store. really security. amount money stores gain better understanding customer habits far outweighs amount lost due theft. Pretty sure mean shit. You’re important doubt media would notice could ""hunker down"" government paid us stay home. going away soon. make masks?

/s  saw scientific reports saying kids rarely get seriously sick spread adults. 

Also first thing Japan close schools covid hit rates continue quite low. lack college, ask me... People upset changed guidelines early days scientific basis take ‘airborne’ part could justify sending doctors without n95s stick things people’s mouths/throats Denmark testing lot people. Sweden normal guess. Let fix you:  

""&lt;Literally outraged White House &lt;you put anything they've done still problem testing come substantially it’s hard tell shift data result fewer actual cases fewer *known* cases. Deaths per day steady months haven’t really come down. sabotaging themselves, they've corrupted political leadership. plus sign. Good. Social media reason, right there. Completely instills bullshit ideas concepts people can't critically think's brains. think spiritual representation everyone's extended family right lol ""stop hitting yourself"" would informing ill informed Canadian. TIL  got gasoline, bring matches. second wave? never ended first wave Foresee nice gofundme plus big corporate apology stand behind team people #1 offer job back. 

You know, it’s public PR mess now, actually thought it. I've known groups inept well decade since entering pharma/biotech industry young scientist... Lyme disease pharmacy school. really get mind blown find CDC inept, easily corrupted outside groups like politicians insurance companies... mainstream medicine blindly follows despite overwhelming evidence conclude. Knowing pre-pandemic, scientist able basically predict pandemic every step way (some us know talking about, despite media saying nobody knows going on) even advised CDC bioterrorism preparedness (concluding totally unprepared, 2008-2009)... insanely frustrating watch try fail job, mostly stifled Trump GOP also frankly suck easily manipulated well. Right. one thing suffer together. another thing segment population says ""I'm going sacrifice bit freedom life good health"". 

It's depressing staying home, waiting out, worrying problems. way depressing knowing people taking problem seriously, making things worse, even care. reliable bo(ugh)ts thread. Fake news people, time move on! 🤣🤣🤣 won't, relax. numbers think incorrect? think many cases July? Huh? anything? No. Schools need funding safe getting it. pointless go back.

Some schools got covid kit like bottle sanitizer box masks told open.  ""But didn't."" -- Narrator 2120 100 year anniversary documentary demise Great Experiment pushing cases time save lives? Denmark hospitals get overwhelmed? unique stereotypical ""ugly American"" way? That's stupid. person originated US local.

If want get rid xenophobia towards us, let's give world reason get act together.

Not gonna happen though, American morons like these

However, understand frustration I'm nearly 50, gf have...really taken pandemic lifestyle. miss socializing much, fortunately privilege work home quite bit.

Buuut...100% agree sentiment. *Your* sentiment. every right feel way do, necessarily even ascribe differing attitudes age. feel differently it. Plenty people age older chomping bit, too.

I guess comment meant provide bit nuance. everybody hates masks/distancing/etc. I'm planning continuing least form indefinitely, even I'm vaccinated. really never expected COVID take quickly did. remember first happened people said ""oh, nothing worse flu"" turned really truth. really believed first serious boy wrong. always take quarantine seriously thought working home since April time goes people seem willing risk something ""normal"". seen friends months news might take 2024 get everyone shots need....i wonder means next years..... thanks companies like hanes stepped up. would’ve less shit show didn’t allow companies move PPE manufacturing China disturbing. drug stores also? one mentioned Obama, bruv.   Lol. better provide source like Världen Idag. It’s right wing evangelical publication known critical things evangelical. Like gays, muslims government. 

Try again. credible estimations I’ve seen 15.5 US it. even mild infections possibly causing lung heart scarring CFR. Constant negativity constant positivity, end mind numbing exhausting deal with.

But reactions things entirely fault. likely grim Trump people Social Media constantly play situation. So, he's fighting hard save lives properly educate people. issue lot people spend much time listening Social Media, real information. Minneapolis ones way bigger, too. lot night. Still cases show it, really. saw homeless guy here. Grabbed one ground slapped on. 👁👄👁 face saw that. something something pikachuuu, something something sub-rise! 

But frankly: really, back, numbers dont go cdc directly entire extended family? Ugh. Clearly didn’t read part said everything supposed right second wave, supposed waves virus? last one? news story explaining happening Hong Kong. Maybe little propoganda well, make less truthful. ... realize unable afford, say, insulin, due job loss would result death, correct? Yeah heard 6 times hour thing hard time believing it...We’re supposed get report third party inspector haven’t received access yet. Thanks much taking time respond! God Americans stupid.

Also, I’m American. Sorry, world. Same... bring back flogging instances cunt completely disregarding safety society large ?

Stuff like drunk driving, self-isolating aware infected contagious disease, making fire woods there's risk fire (like dry season). 

Stuff often little consequences, huge consequences things go wrong. 

Flogging kill assholes, pain combined public embarrassment might make think twice next time. Idk wait long. Canada 190M doses coming, need 74M whole country. I'm sure gov donate Commonwealth countries Africa! Firstly, clue making complex analogies simple idea. 

And two, instance Trump fully fault, similar Dubya fault 9/11 Katrina response. Trump circumventing senate appoint temporary yes men always gets way appointed Kushner directly oversee federal response. whole Trump byproduct generation Democrats playing nonexistent center Republicans dragging Overton Window furthest right leading complete abdication duty Republican held seats, compounded Democrats taking eons take stand climate, education, voter suppression culminating rule richest rich, otherwise known rule minority. 

We need politician greed rich, force free fair elections, neuter ever loving shit every Presidential power, codify old norms laws decades prison breaking them, force Senate reflect people, kill electoral collegw more. However one blame piss poor Covid response, therefore dead, Trump full power decisions made, prior check would subjected too, 200K dead? That's him. think source (linked bottom) says wearing mask may increase chances asymptomatic. two teachers shared classroom teach summer school. One infected other. teacher passed away. God suck!!! Yes. Literally comment called -2.

Also responding part think use deflect. technically topic. can't respond intelligently respond waste others time.

If respond actual topic. responding lies, simply block you.

Edit: evidence easily proven lie

http://imgur.com/gallery/k7C9b3v They're also hermits socially awkward virgins. Call sick 90% blame politic. Never history could get rid pandemic easily (great scientific advance, medecine, communication, sanitation, etc), mess globe politic people's selfishness.  East West Dakota? smell foul play. Yeah gotta announcement Election Day curry favor. possible know something without knowing everything. Actually pretty much impossible avoid. city this.

Last heard, community service penalty crimes committed common practice US, Canada, lot countries.

Considering number dead Covid, graves sadly needed; people *directly contributing number dead* help serve community digging graves? Seems like perfectly fitting punishment me.

Anti-maskers directly affect others around directly cause harm others; they've committed crime (of trying harm others choice wear mask) serve sentence crime?

I'll surprised ready end 2021. They're second wave still yet defeat first. Also, people resistant lockdowns (iirc), there's that. like touch mask hands near face shopping store. I'm unable wash hands use hand sanitizer, bother removing mask. husband went northern VT couple months ago happy see everyone wearing masks—even outside. wish ai could say it’s NH live. many people wear masks get stores take inside. It’s really disheartening. get tested awaited results I'm one people know!

Also, careful get it. worked employee health office amount people come vaccination take infection prevention precautions. sick people around office they’re still putting phones seats tables putting faces, etc. assuming wearing mask public avoiding crowds, restaurants, bars sports events would protect getting flu along covid 19. wrong? outright egregious trump campaign slogan? hate presentation milestones nothing language. Like world improve weeks months leading widespread near complete vaccination. Also, written way induce fear WITHOUT making people think really affected logistical issues. going people living high income countries getting vaccinated 2024. Google Ron DeSantis modern definition ""premature"".

The real problem businesses everywhere could probably open safely restrictions, main asshole charge left group sub-assholes charge, everywhere things differently, neither protected general public economy. country effectively running like 18 wheeler 18 wheels running different speeds moving different directions. could highest risk? Aside choir practice, think situations room full people exhaling breath across room like that. There's way spreading event gym. catch sitting restaurant 20+ feet away someone asymptomatic, surely get gym everyone breathing deeply.  Nearly everyone? Source please. yah NOTHING rude wrote. Turning smoking ease stress stupid be. much better, healthier ways, exercise one. 

Year 2000? *knew* smoking would decrease lifespan quality life. Ask Jared... Always look bright side life!

Life’s piece shit take look Yeah dude nobody telling go ride bike wilderness. Interesting data. Though think asian countries mask wearing culture, neither uae. Masks common japan degree china. Yes, glad someone saying it. downvotes people enabling incredibly self-destructive behaviour. Humans built extended periods isolation. Go outside meet people park ffs. Lol stop damn dramatic actually use brain moment. come back discussion This. I'm fortunate position able work home, I'm enough social introvert lack contact people spouse hardship. health issues make us vulnerable COVID-19, issues also mean unexpected vaccine reaction could problematic well. we're fine waiting bit we're convinced vaccines rushed. 

More importantly, first shipments go medical staff, first responders, seniors nursing institutions, whole host people need. afford wait turn. young healthy flu actually dangerous Hold on, heard top rounded corner US /s Last year FAA. institutions burning. high fever cough 4th September, 5th cough went away still fever heavy sweating.

Then 6th September, went testing test came positive. fever much lower sweating still persisted. asked quarantine home gave medicine.

Then slight fever couple days kinda feeling better 100%.

Am danger zone still risk end ICU? Like want know worst behind me. eating healthy sleeping property. team ""Rule Law Society &amp; Rule Law Foundation"" NY 1 author defector doctor. going totally trust this. Except didn’t sugar coat anything. made straight attack mom. lot happen 4 years. 

2020: hold beer pretty normal retail pharmacies; get ass beat ""customer"" aka habitual violent shoplifter already told corporate requested security of, get fired telling customer ""thank sir may another"". industry is. Nah Wouldnt surprised flu deaths absolutely plummet combination current measures harvesting effect deaths already. : UAE @mohapuae issues Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) first #covid19 vaccine, starting first healthcare workers - UAE Gov Press Briefing Makes inclined think winter second wave grossly overblown...since hard hit areas south reaching 20% immunity according models.

Now I’d worry states far effective responses, Colorado people dont want it, dont want right away due testing quick. Im numbers research kind gal right away data research eventually get one. Legally? No, handful states age limits 10 leaving child home alone. Kids age definitely manage *survive* own, school starts 4-5yrs old there’s lot kids 10. Additionally, you’d also hoping 10 12 year olds (middle school age states) self regulating managing time dial classes get school work done alone. 

Some kids responsible enough manage own, even responsible need support. I’d view ages age parents likely comfortably manage working home keeping kid task enough keep virtual school going well. Working outside house still going touch go otherwise. 10 it’s possible legal states leave kids devices day.  hear understand, sath29. 

You tough spot. answered upthread, won’t go please know (and young people reading along) people seem get uniquely challenging young people. Ignore them.

Please don’t give trying find help handling this, mentally, emotionally, financially. deserve help. 💐 Unfortunately can't. research study cannot unblind patient study doctor. literally thing changed added statistic young people hospitalized added bit big 10 athletes he's working 2 Russian presidents. That's really good point. like friend group always something negative say. Yeah, maybe they're right... umpteenth time hearing it, everyone kinda rolls eyes ignores it. Pathetic. Obviously much what’s wrong you. mom tough life things got stressful got older didn’t wanna smoke kids never till older. another rude thing say? keep feeling sorry you? Yeah, mentioned well. they’re still sure react flu vaccine, recommended getting early. It’d incredible universal flu vaccine. Someone explained gamble year determining strain vaccinate for. It’s fascinating.

In case, thank sincerely replies. None three companies coronavirus vaccines advanced clinical trials United States made public protocols statistical analysis plans trials — detailed road maps could help independent scientists better understand trials designed hold companies accountable deviate plans. cases, crucial details trials set — points independent board review early study results conditions trial could stopped early — made “We’ve never important clinical trial — series clinical trials — recent history,” said Dr. Eric Topol, professor molecular medicine Scripps Research La Jolla, California, longtime expert clinical trials. “Everything transparent.” It’s do, making double sure upvote comment frequently recently, can’t let people get discouraged especially good info! Sugar coating kills. entire USA Today page big link accidentally click?  Military isnt even getting first come out. hope so, came back getting groceries people brush past less metre. Swearing mask seemed help somewhat...  person behind “research” little credibility, keeps popping political propaganda. She’s Fox News etc alleged receive funding/support Steve Bannon. 

Either way, despite author’s unsubstantiated claim contrary, research origin virus banned peer review journals etc. purely fodder conspiracy nuts tend uncritically gobble bullshit like this. anyone tips navigating company gaslighting thinking safe come open office everyone unmasked ""unless getting moving around""? (which makes sense all) I'm south gunning reopen since June. I'm office worker house since March (i health issues) job entirely home. Well, one little difference though, form potentially hundred thousand avoidable deaths.

I'm German country authorian regime caused death millions well communist one-party surveillance state recent past. I'm sure need explain Nazis even GDR tolerated system. Anyone could uncommon someone end jail best friend reported them. hope understandable want either systems weakening resolve Covid happen.

Good governance instead bad governance sounds great theory - believe good government requires solid foundation withstand even powerful bad influences within. me, that's achievable democracy population that's willing able defend it. citizens can't defend anything allowed speak opinion without risking jail (or worse) right demonstrate.  

Just system works well majority mean good system. Ask Holocaust victims relatives think system worked well many Germans Nazis power. good government _needs_ protect weakest vulnerable minorities - China well US seem struggle right now.

I'll check links later I'm pretty sure change mind :) mean, kind valid points... “We’re kind sheltered bubble, will, that’s kind helped us date,” Joanasie said. 

It's unfortunate story indicate extent Nunavut exactly contained bubble.

Anyone travelling Nunavut must first go 14-day quarantine Isolation Center.  New Zealand successful getting back 100% normal.  Isolation Hubs actually recommends travellers, countries US implementing them. hasnt used tested long enough, mention politicized. Yep, I'm southern Ontario tell apart someone northern Ontario accent. 

Canadian accents indeed vary noticeably geographically.  Thanks! thinking same. Seeing better would definitely improve quality life. wonder he’d able wear mask procedure  Agreed. Still, ridiculous NOTHING done correct like 6 months. could made millions masks!! we're going fall/winter probably shortages. often seen happen? implying they’re slowing due political reasons? need include minorities trial vaccine needs tested different races, ages, morbidities, etc. Produce masks United States Thank you.

Thank again. bioterrorists win again. Rude dont make grandma, say people. people important you. bad everyone feels way too, bro. realistic paranoia. Err safe side still living life carefully. hubby 62, turning 50 year. high risk &amp; careful 58 year old neighbor &amp; friend passed early on. Completely shocked saddened. Stay well!!! kind agree u/Bombedmeteor. lock up. fact we’ll still listen complaining Reddit locked good. fuck rite aid policy protect clueless, selfish, violent customer 1st. employee totally expendable. Deaths already bad enough. sure, let's also ignore long-term (possibly permanent) effects, significant numbers long-haulers, too. America mRNA vaccines new completely different technology. example? measurement? 180000 dead America make take seriously, nothing will. site references anti-vaxxers leading protests? named Alex Jones heard organizers anti-vax movement organizing. seems like getting lumped rest specific reason. there's vaccine. stopped anti-vaxxers claiming global conspiracy use vaccine inject people nano bots. spout medicine promote snake oil crap. Blame Bill Gates anti science conspiracy crap.

I heard arguments listed above. say anything vaccines, reasoning, vaccine avoid, group blamed problematic point. one wait blame anti-vax group vaccine comes out? active organizing anti-mask protests restrictions fair enough. 

On flip side, social circle adamantly supports vaccines ones exceedingly restrictions, mask mandates, thinks covid exaggerated, seem bothered nearly 200,000 people US dying, think social distancing government taking far. people, BLM, supporting lifestyles democrats.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* everyone else silly trusting doctors Well, well-funded instead sophisticated. wish getting paid. y’all getting paid stay scared spread fear??? got paying people *corrupt* him. coronavirus crisis United States example happens cronyism gets smacked face reality. mean yeah get decision sucking also driven shortage masks I'm remembering correctly. also told us would okay reuse reusing I'm really sure exactly said cuz ago.

Unfortunately logistical issues considered line science saying clarifying. ways I'm ""taking chances"" wear mask. dont mind wearing mask indefinitely long quality life remains intact.

I'm going ""travel"" moab downhill mountain biking. Risk/reward. Idk. prefer driving though opposed flying sucks. naive best. think 2024 may pessimistic, however realistic saying boom one fall.  wait spring... hope. Yet last month tons people jumping threads saying yep vaccine soon!!! said betting see safe effective vaccine that. willing bet coverage hits 60% industrialized countries places start getting it. Oh assume one people think freaking BABY counts person? Yea bet antibodies early infected (likely 2 million plus) really helping now. Isn’t bit early making kind calls? one knows we’ll March.

Edit: earth downvoted asking question? unironically yes. hero would pick school like more. think year, make progress, whether vaccine, rapid testing, treatments, etc. look today compared 6 months ago - death rate dropped improved treatments large percentage population wears masks public. article good job explaining avoid school outbreaks others went wrong outbreaks occurred. anesthesiologists (: Amen.   would say deserve virus. Problem spread innocent people. fined. mean that's great sure enforce without military intervention improved flu shot rates 5%, CDC estimates would avoid nearly 483,000 flu infections.

This obviously wrong winter 2021 even layperson like me. evidence points flu season practically nonexistent.

We know flu R0 bit 1, low enough drops 1 summer. also know R0 covid without social distancing much higher--well 2. also know current R0 covid around 1 given seeing exponential growth decline. 

So social distancing cut R0 covid least half. flu going magically keep R0? course not. Flu's R0 way 1 year, going almost cases like southern hemisphere 2020: cases stupid young people worried covid also unlikely hospitalized get flu.

I get people get flu shot normal year, *least* important year ever get flu shot.  6 ACH achievable even older system 100% fresh air (100% OA). HEPA filters likely possible. take much space MERV 5 filter. MERV 13 filters may possible could positive effect. love too, sound like awesome human being. friends?

By way never said anti mask. named whole bunch examples people need licensed. think still would have. hard part virus asymptomatic pre symptomatic transmission people extremely mild symptoms. Even early knowledge virus people still would silently spread it. said may prevented early spikes deaths since places may shut sooner. Yes, life needs go please take seriously. Im sick tired attitude. cant meet people freshers week uni guys meet groups like 28 shoot things? Damn ex pats tourists. worst live there. Fuck, already considering vegetarianism. think might actually take plunge. Ah yes, Interview, two stoners plotting kill Kim Jon-Il, would guaranteed blockbuster success went theater first. Lmao I've worked investment banking private equity international firms (including one actually mentioned Big Short) 15 years, yes, would know equity markets, I'll watch clarification Board members certainly sell stock good news, cannot sell insider knowledge bad news coming. would never make company's compliance department. course percentage. one long dust settles, possible purpose could serve pretend infection automatically lead outcomes already know exist?. deaths. recoveries, 

Because there's big difference long term effects happening 1 100 cases 1 100000 cases. 

So far 30 million people worldwide COVID 20 million people recovered. many 20 million think permanent chronic damage?  vastness going help live middle urban core though. CDC United States says: 

""Based know time, people following conditions might increased risk for severe illness COVID-19:

- Asthma (moderate-to-severe)"" state evidence ""mixed"", meaning ""multiple studies reached different conclusions risk associated supposed plan emergencies instead squeezing every last drop profit.

It's amazing world thinks fair reasonable corporations get bailed ""nobody could foreseen this"" individual people supposed starve poor planning. You’d surprised many movies spend year coming out. Usually it’s terrible movies though, release slow season. Yes true. first always shown death rate testing far made death rate look way worse was.

Now never see anything death rate increased testing also increased cases focus.

It really much ask given entire story instead attempts scare people. idea people want continue social distancing wearing masks get vaccinated preposterous That’s meant ""I hear you, instead take money -- hear -- pump stock market."" 

&amp;#x200B;

\-some politician probably Rosa Parks would wear mask. people followed advice health professionals right thing start would prolonged.


We return normal get rid virus. That’s works.

Otherwise people starve it’s fault listening. Better lonely dead.  3 million people die US every year. 200k lot, overwhelming majority people old. doomsday scenario. never closed Sweden Sweden fine. Canonically yes, engineer research (“science”) unknown 

Out curiosity, expand type research do? contribute scientific literature, produce proprietary/secret results many colleagues degrees medicine/physics/math/chemistry/etc aren’t “engineers” applications based industry fits exact problem-solving definition engineering. 

It sounds like aren’t scientists current roles, studied science (physics, chemistry) applying it. Many engineers field hold positions like Senior Scientist Data Scientist applications, research. engineers, use science.

“Data Scientist” particular meaning industry science, “computer scientist” science, math. Also, industry, someone “software engineer” title might studied “software engineering” engineering, studied computer science instead knows code. Companies make titles, might align academic definitions science (which excludes computer science, it’s part math) engineering. fair enough, debate worth otherwise lockdowns Australia democratically elected governments states territories decided lockdowns.
it's essence democracy work, majority rules, majority still supports lockdown Melbourne large margin.
Those opposed lockdown simply outvoted, assembly temporarily suspended due pandemic free express dissent free assemble groups express dissent, rest us free assemble groups purpose.
It's collective decision majority minority must accept it, alternative lawlessness.
So Facebook, petitions, letters, emails phone calls members parliament press means contravene lawful health orders place.
If sufficient feel must break law prepared bear consequences. Exactly, there's use sugar-coating omitting facts. virus linger years, frankly seems like every government disingenuous presenting complete facts &amp; risks public.

There strong suspicion nearly everyone catches covid nervous system damage organ damage permanent. severe, way know long-term implications without multiple tests autopsies. absolutely able exercise free open restaurant.

They might get punished violating law, free remains unhindered. want call respect there's time delay death, that's fine. thing. thing extremely Contagious, travels air, spread asymptomatic people, could kill you. impossible know someone else risk. someone figured yet, need continue providing information do.

Their lack fear (or respect) terrorizing us understand. ridiculous. basically slavery great saints reddit don‘t care fits narrative time 🤙🏼 us non Americans told stupidity everywhere countries anti science beliefs growing.

From I've seen, Europeans/Canadians rock solid hate boners America Americans pretending dipshits exist US. gym reopened AZ (smaller, many people) went realized noone wearing masks... one like 2 others probably 14. like fuck wrong people.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* talking father phone explosion happened he’s ok lucky. suffered loss sincere condolences. already overwhelmed hospitals flooded one could expect social distancing mask wearing measures respected. heart goes you. Good. probably think thing, like evolution Info: private beach? Public beach? Panama City crowded tourist beach? going dine restaurants go bars there? going around ton people social distancing? wouldn’t risk going around higher risk individuals soon. would say pick poison. See family beach trip. isn’t wrong choice risking exposure family what’s going higher risk behaviors, irresponsible. Nope knows, proof. places re-election therefore economy human life. Think ... pure evil. Sweden # deaths per capita US. would get winter gloating. Yes sure people changing goal. wanted flatten curve did. This. food supply chain literally feeds us. Why. Just. Why.  teachers' student debt-to-income ratio lot disproportionate. sucks. batch cognitive dissonance - weeks wasn’t wearing mask common areas apartment building. easier believe didn’t need to. I’m glad got past it, doesn’t make easier see people behaving badly. Box fans thicker style hepa filters taped every class room option think would fit budgets. Same. feel like many restaurants part Colorado done good job outside dining spaces. Masks worn streets moving around. servers wear masks. won’t eating inside outside ok. I’d interested stats reflect either. Real consequences tort lawyers. Wtf. go? Jesus Christ afraid check ups too? Masks could cure/prevent cancer people south still wouldn’t wear them. California total numbers. classrooms school aren’t connected filtered HVAC systems all. heated radiant heat cooled window units. Great. one L Philip Morris. Dear Dakotas,

Thank making feel little better.

- signed Floridian Perhaps there's top level government organization could perhaps pay employees establishments really compatible pandemic work truly safe. BASED exactly think we're going come this? Everyone hides fucking homes forever? years? vaccine?

I'm sick seeing line. make lot good points, side debate valid. agree said, actually.

But part bullshit, every time see someone arguing side, always gets casually tossed though real thing. MAYBE 4 months ago could get away making point. evidence today, OVERWHELMINGLY likely going much longer. Even cautious experts estimate we'll back normal middle next year. Hahaha must elaborate troll. great read, bravo. Society fucked reacting 1918 pandemic too. People (well, enough people) bad short term small sacrifice long term major benefit thing, especially major benefit absence bad thing rather addition good thing. death cult First all, sorry loss (I imagine sick must statement remember everyone saying person exact opposite deniers actually heart). Second, wanted share story local couple used deniers even admitted saying things said you. couple goes around state speaks important social distancing wearing masks important. touch pain anguish went also coronavirus patients make extremely scared were. Especially wife looked like literally going lose husband one night... lecture attended (outdoor, socially distanced mandatory masks) dry eye attendance. One scariest things I've ever through, glad did. Drive-ins past future. Honestly they’re great way watch film.   might Lysol face accidentally trying clean myself... 😀 Chicago still highest cases Illinois sure talking about. understand take chance go good local spot, can’t believe people packing fucking Applebee’s, chili’s, friendlys, Denny’s among shitty restaurants. harder keep constant low level transmission without blowing suppress virus. I'd believe they'd aim latter.

I believe easier suppress virus suppress billion potential whistleblowers failed efforts, especially given connected world China many people trade family/friend contacts there.

So yeah, could easily believe there's unrecognised clusters forming anywhere, what's alternative scenario? They're managing keep rampaging virus silent time around, despite quickly word got last time? Coronavirii mutate quickly, uniformly. Remember current ""strain"" we're dealing put Madrid, Lombardy, New York backs. might change one locations, implausible virus would mutate way three. Whatever held true March/April likelihood continue hold true least next years. 

I'm personally skeptical ""piss out"" own. I'm stupid enough look situations like Sweden NYC say level current mitigation along measure developed immunity among high contact spreaders working keep infections areas, nowhere majority caught virus. lot people still susceptible, right circumstances occur, we'll back Spring. Vaccines go long way making longer threat people tho dunno, kinda wish acknowledge names, say SHAME walk past them. read ""Karens Tennesee suing school district enforcing mask mandate"" know mean. Oh yes ""peaceful protests"" spreading covid over. actually sound pretty tedious. Benadryl doesn’t cure COVID far know. fever, dry cough, loss taste smell, you’re probably okay.  I’m sure I’d call developing world days. one japan caused big spike corona cases long ago. retarded pretty much end early 2021, maybe around spring right?

I feel thats plenty time vaccine thats rushed get everyone Oh hell yah  Either keep 1bn+ potential whistleblowers silent rampant infections, apply temporary measures long hard enough suppress disease.

They failed keep whistleblowers silent handful cases first time around, people seem think still easier keep people apart weeks... Might rental. Also could parents borrowing it.  thought letting Americans in. can’t nice things. themselves, right? Yeah hear that. like sensationalize adding one thing possibly wreck next 6 months longer spreads like crazy pretty shit haha I’m east coast. I’ve sneezing much throat bleeding. take Flonase year round even that’s touching symptoms, unfortunately - unusual enough thought could covid. 

I think it’s especially bad season though - locate ragweed around house remove it, helped little. Though much, air saturated. agree u learning it. Though think low death rate much positive therein lies disagreement u. think far deadlier virus might killed far less people everyone would treated seriously, usa not. deadly virus elicit much lower response democratic world thus, resulted far deadlier pandemic. 

A good example would international condemnation china's response locking wuhan. seen almost humanitarian violation while. virus requires unpopular overreaction. think many democratically elected leader would willing risk career respond accordingly. love Chris Nolan movies I'm disappointed he's willing worsen pandemic make buck. Monkey business booming. countries brain washed nationalist media outlets. governments use proxy wars tool divert us real issues curruption incompetency politicians. hope generation z gen alpha kids turn less nationalistic less xenophobic. hear you! couple weeks ago saw best friend first time since late December. first face face visit friend I’ve since mid-February. 

We went walk couple hours, masked keeping three feet apart. would knowing scrupulous safety. know brother family isn’t careful, haven’t seen either since Dec. 😣

This hard! Without dog couldn’t it. Luckily best dog I’ve ever had. lifted restrictions Florida Spring break lot cases. Happy help! Oh Uighurs secure. lie you, can't help you. However, try posting multiple subs, multiple times. Try look actual advice experts too, maybe legal advice to, idk.  BOYCOTT RITE AID ???? wish hard hit cities...like NYC would bit aggressive reopening CAVEAT soon certain metric (test positivity/hospitalizations?) hit, reopening rolled back. 

There much idle speculation noise data. People argue overly sterile environments weaken immune systems. understand diet part argument, makes senseZ rebuttal EVERYTHING said, factual, partisan automatically blame trump? /s Dr. Fauci says it, I'll believe it. then...grain salt comes anyone else. Thank you, Hillary Clinton. Really, ever hear resuscitate orders, right die?

It interesting, lots emergency medical professional friends, far share views general population. research bad caregiver let use internet minute. Yes means virus would mutate negative way itself. likely gunna go opposite direction become deadly spread easier. People saying they’re part staying isolated mean sitting basement last several months.

Leaving house doesn’t magically cure stress issues people last several months. Dude. What's worst could happen? 

Right - people guess infection early on. feel really altruistic, they'll stay home days. employer probably like this, may burn PTO. People done that. Or, go ahead whatever want post-exposure wait they're symptomatic presumably spreading virus days. 

Or

Put testing hands people. like home pregnancy tests criticized early doctors way could someone DIY medical test like that. Fast forward today, they're commonplace. Especially since diagnostic. hokey untested cure, yeah, put brakes it, not. health risk almost zero. There's benefit. already people spreading disease testing almost totally failed contain virus. 

Also, companies waiving regulations. read info link posted. Meaning I'm staying house. I'm Germany.

So Also, beating people ask wear masks, happens time well.

Show report. English German think one even killed. 

Speaking guy NTV day, NOPE! I've getting tested every Friday. not. 

I'm alarmed short lines are. drive tent there's like 2 cars max wait for. like I'm out, people choosing get tested here. 

At least testnebraska. 

My sister lives Montana, yet get test. seemed harder get one there. least can't get one nonchalant here. close. (Hi there, fellow Pfizer phase 3 participant!)

Once 150-175 positive tests (since double-blinded, could either group), DSMB unblind look placebo vs vaccine.

I know bar early approval/dosing control group -- feel like higher bar general approval, higher 50% -- 50%, that'd mean want least 100 150 infections placebo group. course they've stopped listening, much evidence stats meddled things actually grim we've led believe albeit sure dangerous, people right wonder cure worse disease (economic devastation mental health going crap everyone). New news released take two doses, take 2024 manufacture many everyone . I'm pretty sure missing point, actually. NY locked earlier, many deaths. Francisco never lockdown though, impose restrictions crowds/masks.

San Francisco second-most densely populated city country. tinderbox. restrictions helped lot. 

What seems like looking things like cases/deaths decide locked down, without regard fact lockdowns big part reason many cases/deaths. 

Basically, like saying since get wet rain, never needed umbrella first place. Well no, umbrella get wet. use resources powerful nation world make masks Everything outright egregious. Yummy! author knows everything saying. choosing omit evidence thinks even 30k flu hospitalizations winter (compared 300k normally) 30k beds can't go covid patients. public health official cant say ""you're much less likely get flu year, still get flu shot."" 

I suspect really wants use covid get whole new cohort people start getting annual flu shots would otherwise. I'm going group. death cult profit lives. United States? info isn’t freely available. ... put phone flight mode need visit stores? cannot speak without accent. Sure, regional, generic still accents. Ah yes. Serve batons speak out. Lock inside they’re sick. Arrest social tracing shows went shouldn’t have. 

Great. Fucking. Service. moved Midwest decade confounded people Wisconsin vote objectively worst candidates possible. I’m convinced they’re masochists. chance sell used cars? I'm taking anything personally. bummed selfish shitty are. I've changed Team Covid. virus blessing disguise. Chlorine gene pool. even notice actual conspiracy even smuck head. [Seeking Advice] boyfriend’s coworker works “close contact” confirmed positive Covid-19. department ignoring clearly defined procedures reporting university’s covid task force. department 6 people past “anonymous” complaints traced back complainant. coworkers concerned subjected retaliation report this. department covering laboratory animal technicians uncommon lab animal requires specialized training work with. don’t plan get animals taken care six quarantine. That’s supervisor’s excuse covering up. 
I feel like foreseeable due nature work environment one person got sick would advised quarantine. feel like started cross-training numerous mice technicians back March case something like happened. 

He can’t quite job, need money. I’m self-employed business taken serious hit due Covid-19. get SNAP doesn’t pay mortgage. feel like keep going work aren’t going follow protocol need limit contact keep safe particularly asthma. live together? sleep separate rooms, share bathroom. think fits Putin's plan make USA's institutions equally credible Russia's institutions. Like doctors cover political poisonings assassinations, sports associations supporting doping Russian victories international events, scientists skip essential steps procedure test corona vaccine making less safe Putin wants able sell and/or use politically. good understanding control virus. Keep distance, wear mask wash hands. changes live normal possible. need stay basements forever. comes across fairly obvious.

I guess know understanding immunity? Sweden immunity kind died, number antibodies = Immunity &lt;10% across cities regions Literal fear mongering even going far say even focus positives situation? f? Really? insane.  worse that. Ah, personally I'm able detect odors assumed functional, fixed bands bit tighter though little metal band tight bridge nose glasses keep thing place top that.

I've yet spot single N95 use I'm at. figured KN95s better cotton/satin layer masks, also since I'm also relatively low risk region little community outbreaks thought it'd safe.

Where leakage typically at, sides? filter itself? FDA ever really trustworthy honest? Due current malfeasance corruption US government leadership, maximal transparency needed. get enough vaccine uptake, there'll still crippling epidemic. reference, province ordered non essential businesses shutdown March 17th, Ontario reported 8 new cases day.

http://globalnews.ca/news/6688824/ontario-coronavirus-covid19-cases-march-17/ Promotion management based tenure merit would kill business... (almost) goes herd immunity via vaccination... Good luck that

\- Texas  ...

[The positive rate going up.] Particularly younger populations. exact pattern US saw early stages every outbreak.

And again, it’s still even winter yet. give cite?

Thanks advance. FDA called EMA (European Medics Agency together EU’s Public Health division) CDC ECDC (European Center Disease prevention) anyone interested. don’t know are. mean none are. manager fired, union representation would likely relevant instance. I've one careful people. Hardly ever going grocery store sticking safe outdoor activities able social distance wear mask. I've living like 6 months, I'm sure keep much longer, I'm boat you. miss going food. miss spontaneously going somewhere. miss going museums. miss browsing stores picking nice things house. Almost every aspect life taken away, except going hiking/walking outside. plan family outings around everything else staying inside much possible go see keep safe. means sometimes postpone see months something urgent. vaccine come out, work, resume normalcy, even means taking risk. Exactly. cdc issue best recommendation context decisions douche chief asinine administration. Uhh, thanksgiving Christmas breaks? know, ones families fly across country get together?  Meh crime unemployment rates get adjusted LOT. I'm Germany.

Also, beating people ask wear masks, happens time well. think one even killed. 

Don't think inner security issues. certainly Japan's level safety.   CDC implement defense act? blaming wrong people. Watch snowflake boys girls, it’s fragile. ask question early March? Regardless predict spring, schedule due June schools similar deadlines meaning luxury wait see happens. make best decisions based information now. Ahh yes... *Pretty sure they've it*, highest level evidence. Big brain science time. live elderly mother high risk hearing vaccine won’t available till probably sometime next year. know could go somewhere still risk even outside could catch virus stay home Mom gave virus could never live myself. Person* *accused ignoring Covid-19 quarantine go Bavaria, Germany bar crawl* 
No need xenophobic headlines COVID... spread... large, indoor gatherings... flu vaccine it, yet, still kills people yearly. literally hallucinating flu, yet, coronavirus asymptomatic.. yeah, I'll pass rushed vaccine... gives anti-maskers opportunity shit scares employees managers something them.

Fuck Rite Aid this! think second shutdown regardless. Laughed way hard Think mean ethically.

Unless meant imply white supremacy. Yeah talking shit, becuase either always running around letting everyone know american. Seeing nust pack leave shows never stake country filled threatened friends colleagues wonder americans screwed corona badly, leave furthering stereotypes. 

No german hate sadly American emigrant. even do, obvious opinion ignored. like house hit rotten legs. Morons gonna moron. isn’t transparency still that, space theories boundless without truth hold in. told would kill ONE US.
Then ""a few""
Then hundred.
Then 60k.
Then 100k.

While sitting relaxing, revealed MULTIPLE times White House posession chose share data predicting millions US lives lost due following policies prescribed.

When model Trump shared month month sole reason outlier much lower predictions proved fatally wrong outside worst case cone possibility 95% time, still kept sharing it.

Well, even statistical abomination shows death toll doubling we're even flu season... nowhere found White House site.

Perhaps luxury living country leaders lie set policy accordingly fighting take away health coverage lucky enough it, deadly serious business cause tidal wave bankruptcies survive, math US wrong... even using conservative versions figures.

I remember people saying particularly bad flu season covid thing. might covid misattributed.

and there's also luck. virus could spreading among young healthy travelers vitamin deficient living apart older relatives thus spared them, lucked go densely populated indoor spaces sick, else managed spread also-healthy people mild cases.

i think crunched numbers months ago came K-value thing basically ""0"". many people give 0 people, people give like 20+ people, that's spreads - superspreader events guaranteed ""each case gives 3 give 3 etc. etc."" Household size also matters, possible wealthy travelers first catch this, lived alone small household sizes. 10 people 3br apartment, one person gets everyone sick. living BF luxury flat, maybe get sick that's it.

No not. country done so, so. ""close"" ≠ able actually eradicate it. I’m trying apologist retail injustice, company specific policy regarding customer mask use. customer shows without mask, ask politely wear one. say medical condition allows exemption, walk away say “have nice day.” don’t argue ask proof. It’s probably similar Rite-Aid. guess manager flexed little hard, violated company policy. I’m playing devil’s advocate here, understand corporations wouldn’t want featured Twitter employees engage viral (no pun intended) arguments masks. Plus potential lawsuits medical-related discrimination Ok let's clear - CDC, well every person works medical profession ALWAYS recommends regularly washing hands. good reason, hands always teeming viruses, bacteria, fungus, bad lot be. 

Now regarding Cov19 fomites, lots legitimate sources first one found cursory google search. opinion, chance transmission inanimate surfaces small, instances infected person coughs sneezes surface, someone else touches surface soon cough sneeze (within 1–2 h). disagree erring side caution, go extremes justified data. Although periodically disinfecting surfaces use gloves reasonable precautions especially hospitals, believe fomites contact infected carrier many hours pose measurable risk transmission non-hospital settings. - *Emanuel Goldman, Professor Microbiology, Biochemistry Molecular Genetics, New Jersey Medical School - Rutgers University, Newark, NJ 07103, USA* 

Regarding mask wanting touch public, essentially different exposed part body (aside hands touch lots different objects) hair part clothing. know gonna say ""yeah mask breath surrounding air therefore going more."" Well, technically yes, MAY depending environment contain small percentage fomites say shirt. remember two things. One, like article mentioned, outside hospital environment going surrounded many virus particles. two, minimum required ""infection dose"" cause infection person. 

So simply put, unless walking around covid ward hours, remove mask lick entire outside it, risk infection handling mask practically zero. Lol. vaccines trials right require 1 m^3 bioariactor 1 month.

So, again, basing assertion on? Reading comment neutral observer, agree contact social media say stupid ignorant. it? Allowing businesses open forcing others closed - Walmart Target open, selling clothes, TV's, toys, etc. Best Buy shopping malls selling things forced close ruled unconstitutional. Hang on. said majority, minority must accept it. majority ordered people together pandemic, told stay homes bushfire, minority accept too.  Ok. Lol. makes America “shithole”? You’re delusional. I’m tired everyone reddit slamming America even littlest fucking things like “the customer always right” mean serious?

Companies follow slogan it’s better retain customer years giving little gift card rather never come back. It’s simple business management article says expect *peak* (that is, culmination) time. 

The poor headline following bad responses suggests 14% commentators read article. rule first amendment rights can’t restriction based content. restrictions based things, like time place. 

A restriction limits *all* speech, regardless it’s saying, content-restriction. 

You need lower standard review restrict non-content based 1st amendment rights. Emergencies typically fit fine. I'm glad father used hardware store take shit customers bother staff standing themselves. dad give fuck. nasty woman, he'd mutter loud enough could hear calling cunt would call men assholes.

No one family friends vapers “caught” lung problem signs viral infection. thought literally 10 seconds would clear you’re wrong. unlikely, simply mathematical reasons. virus spreading California in, say, mid December, that's full three months California put controls place. Three months unimpeded transmission virus something order 20 doublings, million cases, that's additional seedings outside state. first known death COVID Cali March 16. numbers seem work. Yeah miss one two deaths, dozens them, miss thousand cases, hundred thousand. emergency, marshalling people bushfire example, I'd perfectly OK it.
We currently experiencing emergency, see. Yeah? entirely possible I'm almost certain end goal would simply hold vaccine. thing US doing, places lot better. Sure would ""eventually"" surge covid pretty much anywhere/everywhere, even supportive compliant population hold long shitty new way life we're living - cracks defense, said. 

But ""eventually"" delayed vaccine arrives, simply becomes ""never"" see sharp increase cases vaccinated population. 

Make mistake, exit strategy entire world. Even countries done great job keeping thing control still demonstrably struggling hold good level they've achieved. We've seen additional outbreaks places come close ""beating it"" possibly can, we're currently seeing disaster unfold parts Europe appeared virus contained months. We're treading water waiting vaccine. places better others. they've gone 100% outside air possible. bringing outside air, need increase filtration capture COVID trying filter air space, trying flush it.

The issue whether system keep heating cooling load outside air.

Here Bay Area CA, typical classroom would shy 1000 ft^2. system would 3-4 ton, say 1200 CFM. 10' ceiling (10ft*1000ft^2 = 10000 cubic feet), 100% outside air system would perform changeover every 8 min 20 seconds (10,000CF/1,200CF/min = 8.33 min) 7 air changes hour. 

Problem is, system designed take 80° (mixed return) air 55° air conditioning sure hell cut dragging 100° outside. 

Conversely it'll 65° air 100° *lower* airflow heating system suck heating dragging 40° air outside brisk fall winter morning, outside air exchange rate going go 30-50%. show guys mugshot? looks like drugged demon. also saying everyone won’t vaccinated fall 2021

If that’s case need plan doesn’t rely vaccine already know effective lungs suck absorbing things, otherwise administered medicine / vitamins would inhaled Interesting idea, falls apart soon author tries think, TBH. says ""what explains lack spike cases"" says bunch random stuff - contact tracers testing...OK, things dictate whether disease spreads not.

If he's insinuating contact tracing cuts spread, he's telling truth. r/NYC full stories people contacted way late tracing stop anything, happening all.

He mentions testing. NYC over-testing testing re-testing people based jobs. makes positive % artificially low. 

But really explain spreading much anymore here. Articles drug development really don’t belong kind sub they’re almost always misinterpreted Literally went office jobs retail sex work clients tend nicer boss me.

Retail sucks majorly agree. keep things generally locked it’s truly safe reopen. social distancing too. Reopen people become complacent there’s another spike.

Especially super spreader events recently.

Edit. I’m talking California, like article. Substantially mid 2021. odds least one effective widely available vaccine looking good.

Maybe mid-2022 residual direct issues go away.

The economic fallout going take longer clean though. Except one ~~is~~ *was recently* 1st world country. current populace... hell no.  
Example: idiotic conversation someone bars.  coworker son lost senior year shit time getting 1st year started college covid.  jumped said bars nightclubs inherently going work age covid community really low levels transmission, maybe bars shouldnt thing lower case counts want schools open.  even suggested subsidizing owners.  


Then mentioned people need go fun (which sort understand) bars important (which think horseshit). said maybe Americans NEED get priorities straightened capitalist society seem real disconnect actions desired results. suggested maybe need eat piece humble pie realize tough claim fortitude without greater good. reminding literally 6 months (185 freaking days things open majority that).  spouted crap strongest people earth able deal anything comes way. shit 1 minute later talking going shopping sheer fact getting house 12 days lockdown cracking pressure. 


This educated women pandemic would seen average american citizen. 2024 long. true, majority funding federal government. Exactly right. I'm going sound really conspiracy saying honestly think upper elite working good general population push issues divide country fight amongst instead realizing hard fucking us. no, judge impeached. I’ve seen patient necrotic tongue, blinded pressure eyes, etc. skin issues alone terrible. wish places would include testing numbers compared last week. It’s good news numbers were. it’s testing going doesn’t really help us.  

###### Nursing home crisis

By third week March, New York City hospitals [were brimming coronavirus experiencing shortages masks protective gear. Hospitals found odds nursing homes refused readmit residents hospitalized coronavirus, according officials involved response.

Mr. Raske, president Greater New York Hospital Association, said contacted Mr. C’s team help nursing homes. Hospitals couldn’t afford house recovered nursing-home residents long-term, models showing soon could swamped.

Within days, Mr. C’s team approved order state’s health department said nursing homes couldn’t refuse admit patients simply tested positive. order would become one controversial decisions response.

Health Department spokeswoman Jill Montag said decision “made merits public-health experts DOH following \[Centers Medicare Medicaid Services\] CDC guidelines.” CMS CDC guidance time said nursing homes could accept residents diagnosed Covid-19 could follow necessary precautions prevent transmission.

[Nursing-home operators immediately saying would introduce virus facilities.

Some ignored order, including nursing home upstate Rensselaer County refused accept Covid-positive patients hospitals. county-run home, 362 beds, recorded deaths virus, said Rensselaer County Executive Steve McLaughlin.

“We didn’t advertise state know vindictive \[C\] is, would tried force issue,” said Mr. McLaughlin, Republican.

In response, Richard Azzopardi, senior adviser Mr. C, said state would considered science-based concerns Mr. McLaughlin raised.

Mr. C’s aides said unaware order objections nursing homes, learned questioned news conference April 20.

Dr. Zucker told state lawmakers never saw March 26 statement national group representing nursing-home health providers described policy “not least consistent patient safety principles.”

State health officials [said July long-term-care facilities already rife infection March 25 nursing-home order, attributing spread among patients employees brought virus work.

 

Senior members Mr. C’s staff reviewed edited report published, state officials said. governor’s team also withheld approval resumption nursing-home visitations, people familiar matter said, rejected Health Department proposal regional approach easing ban.

A Health Department spokesman said agency taken thoughtful approach involves “monitoring data, reviewing reasonable requests recognizing pandemic over.”

Some nursing-home advocates said one biggest factors spread lack personal protective gear staff. said state health department steered precious supplies masks gowns hospitals.

The state said provided 15 million pieces personal protective equipment nursing homes.

The state began tracking deaths inside nursing homes mid-April, amid alarming reports bodies piling up. governor aides lacked deep connection nursing-home operators hospital community, according nursing-home advocates officials involved response. governor’s aides said treated hospitals nursing homes equally.

Dr. Zucker said number nursing-home residents died Covid-19—more 6,400—is low relative Northeastern states, measured percentage overall state population.

While New York recorded 33 nursing-home deaths every 100,000 state residents, New Jersey reported 75 deaths per 100,000, Connecticut 86, health department said July report.

The New York figures, unlike reported New Jersey Connecticut, don’t include residents died hospitals. health-policy experts analyzed federal death data said true number virus-related fatalities New York nursing homes likely exceeds 10,000.

 

On June 19, Mr. C ended run daily briefings—111 all.

While rates infection starting rise Southern Western states, virus loosened grip New York. number New Yorkers hospitalized declined 90% since middle May, when[ regions state’s economy began process Mr. C built around data benchmarks.

New York processing many 100,000 coronavirus tests day, second-highest number state fourth-highest per capita basis, according Johns Hopkins University.

Shutting battered state’s economy. New York lost 1.8 million jobs April, bringing unemployment rate 15% June. virus reduced state’s expected tax receipts fiscal year $13.5 billion expected $87.9 billion, according state budget office. revenue shortfall, state withheld $2 billion school districts, municipalities social-services organizations. Mr. C pushing federal aid.

Still, polls show around three-quarters New Yorkers approved governor’s overall handling crisis. job-approval rating jumped 36% February 62% end June, according Siena College Research Institute.

In August 19 radio interview, Mr. C acknowledged making litany mistakes. said wished issued mask mandate earlier, regretted saying asymptomatic people couldn’t spread virus.

“We late finding virus here,” said Mr. C, adding believed federal government shared blame. “The collective ‘we’ made many mistakes.”

the end That’s concern. Low April numbers good news, guess, still numbers predate latest peak numbers. low numbers reach peak, even higher numbers. 

Fauci says we’re still first surge pandemic.

Edit: never thought I’d get downvoted quoting Fauci. they're not. Trump judge. look CDC recommendations, say much interaction person quarantining, rather interaction someone Covid. Also threshold use 15 min &lt; 6 ft distance. would say meet threshold quarantine, likelihood getting sick low. definitely seems like jumping gun me, need finalize schedules better safe sorry guess ? ""Common sense basic human behavior"" *supersede ACTUAL DATA.* 

And sure hell thing informs policy decisions affect livelihoods tens millions people. They're already saying vaccine enough us reopen though. Thanks. -6.4% Q2 2020 compared Q2 2019. Maybe usual way compare kind data. Comparing Q2 Q1 year reduction 4.5%. Apparently spellcheck decided correct aparently. 

Anyway, level I'm including t-cell immunity. Several scientists hypothesized 30% population gets infected disease wanes. happened Sweden, Lombardy, NYC. Look UK. Single-digit deaths lives there. Tourist, lives works Germany area services US military „only“ vacations greece. german news agencies corrected themselfes today (source german: Die 26-Jährige war laut Landratsamt vor kurzem von einem Urlaub im europäischen Ausland nach Garmisch zurückgekehrt. Vorherige Angaben, wonach es sich um eine aus den USA eingereiste Touristin handle, korrigierte die Behörde.

approximately: district authority said 26 year old returned vacations european countries Garmisch long ago. Previous informations said USA coming Tourist corrected authority. They’re mindless, mindfully, purposely sabotaging every agency financial gain.

Honestly always wandered people telling truth anti maskers never experience one. thing is, majorly Trump despite inept CDC. Actually, Obama Biden put place important group, pandemic response team, Trump got rid 2018. actually started ramp things up.

25-44: 0.031%

45-64: 0.46%

65-74: 3.1%

75+: fatality considered pretty high, though given mom female actual odds significantly better that, clear right smoking interact risk. Take care good luck! We’re busy clutching pearls scandal what’s going one actually anything. high one, sub loves pretend otherwise. Fat guy checking here, that's super fucked horrible thing say someone. Shame you. Except, no, cannot. wait outcome ongoing investigation IVO (Health Social Care Inspectorate) looking 92 1700 care homes 70% deaths occurred, like rest us. investigation concluded facts, merely spreading accusations rumours ""matter-of-fact"". value truth take advice. different info would happy read it.

You show google apple info wrong wish. lot states, positivity rate tests increasing, meaning statistically people infected, need increase number tests. even mention co-workers/friends need smart things(masks, social distancing, etc.), suddenly insulted implying smart.

seems like they're smart this.... airlines impose fines themselves? pay fine fly anymore.

Flying luxury. guaranteed service provided taxpayer like roads libraries. Private companies could institute database difficult individuals permit fly. People change tune realize could get 6 month ban commercial airlines. Build factories? [We already-built N95 production lines idle administration played politics pandemic. excess capacity social stigma terrifying me. tell roommates I’m positive, quarantining room trying somehow protect 1 kitchen 1 bathroom, worrying parents sick, tell boyfriend potentially able go work, sounds like absolute nightmare. sort craft would really help! 

Gandhi used recommend daily practice 30 minutes (he spun wool) anything involving complex hand movements concentration make mistake — that’ll work. Turns Gandhi proven right brain scans. Performing complex handwork requiring concentration mutes “anxious ruminating” source real pain depression.

Florida waiting actually go outside... it’s almost cool enough enjoy outside again... new, still kind fucked fact, get feeling countries cultures look human intellect education.

Yeah, much problems West's approach pandemic anti-intellectual culture fueled extensively fake news right-winged parties. strawman. Nobody public health measures must proportionate must beneficial people affected them. Scientists make policies. conduct studies make recommendations. hope works better infamous Canadian made “Fruit Machine.” Yes, secrecy unfortunate. 'adverse event' anaphylactic reaction days damned. Choose seconds minutes. They're rather dramatic events. I'd guess decided 'reaction' due vaccine. hazier timeline. secrecy ? Well we're talking big money here. case vaccines national interests geopolitics come play. 

It's sad days Dr, Salk giving away vaccine free world long past. even sadder present regression barbarism seen 'normal' many even 'commendable' some. area happend quarantined 160 new cases last two weeks 9 cases / 10k inhabitants.
So ideal, also high risk area.
 true, austria spiking 6k new cases last two weeks, training home would better. 
Summer vacation traveling showing effects across europe. yeah mask stuff easy now. I've one since March. pretty surreal experience putting first time. feel funny public on. something specific. 

What need get hard info use point deniers prove way forward stop people.

Because right 200k lot people. don’t stop around ppl crying loud! Criminal charge. National No-fly list.

Problem solved.

This many months still arguing airports planes wilfully negligent belligerent.

Either way penalized making effort entire crew passenger list. ??? 2020 getting spicy October - ""strengthening Chakra - CDC recommends bleach douching, herbal oils, crystals fight Covid"" Antobody tests inconclusive. make antibodies. 

Positive result means it, negative means it. lmao post history. expected. I'm sorry. tried going support groups, teams, meetups, etc.? Making friends adult sucks TBH People downvoting cus can’t read constitutional amendments guess spread slows down, it'll still spread everyone it'll take longer. also severe economic downsides.

The reason measures stop healthcare system overwhelmed (which happen) people getting treatment needed it. I'm strongly pro-vaxx, I'm definitely going first person line get covid vaccine. still cases NYC, largely suppressed, lowest daily case numbers compared parts US. Last checked sneezing Covid symptom, likely something else, although also possible both. that's something done snap fingers redirecting production/budget simple task. rate, places like New Zealand still locked everywhere else world will, combination prior infections vaccine, R value that's super low.

At point 60 million Americans gotten it, including lots people engage riskiest activities. think cases deaths declining weeks? absolutely would choose 2 grocery workers elderly person better ability isolate whereas grocery workers risk health order feed house themselves. it’s bit slap face people who’s jobs put risk year prioritize obviously disagree whatever. Idk is, *know* threshold herd immunity 100% vaccination that’s unattainable goal. You’re never going vaccinate everyone. 

I think bring great point world improve extensive vaccine rollout. Right many places able control spread extent, that’s without vaccine. vaccine able see really effective mitigation measures, even scale they’re *now* masking social distancing guidelines. measure plus vaccine would amazing. 

Also, we’re able decrease IFR something closer flu using therapies already have, would also extremely helpful. We’re going right direction. know quite bit treating virus. 

The chance eradicating virus point pretty slim, you’re completely right saying all-or-nothing articles fear-mongering. 10 times already! 'pretty sure'. Indoor dining open across country (and NY state) led anything overwhelmed. 

They'll fine. Yup never send kids back school mistake. problem.

“Person disagree must awful categories too”

Fuck off. free tea I’ll math that.

Also...mmm...pork loin. I’m hungry now. China good job containing COVID dictatorship. well leadership respect Science, infrastrucure competent enough carry large-scale lockdowns.

I think that's it. There's nothing China made uniquely equipped handling pandemic. Rather, something remarkably wrong Western societies days make fail spectacularly pandemic.

The degree selfishness short-sightedness practiced civilians government officials West staggering. currently live North America took brief visit mall yesterday. mall filled people. Nobody respecting social distancing. credit, wear masks (it Asian mall) that's gonna help much many people city hit second wave.

If people help it, can't stay home? can't help it, least go uncrowded places? can't go uncrownded places, least stay outside? can't stay outside, can't least keep social distancing inside?

Well kiss 20s goodbye... might well pop kids retire earlier younger traveling. comment aged like finest wine world maybe let organization going shit Absolute new cases going since July 4th, going ~70k /day ~35k/day today.

Gosh darn forgot.  thus - outdoor school much possible really thing. Like day 1 March lockdown leaders figuring this. cases gave initials, date birth, geographical area sex, meaning risk identification low, Public Health Wales (PHW) said. Hahahahaahha hahahahaha may true, that's usually tied Freedom Speech clause 1st Amendment, Freedom Peaceful Assembly Freedom Press. government may generally restrict time, place, manner ***speech***, restrictions unrelated speech says leave people enough alternative ways expressing views.

Even then, Gov't restrict speech, must provide alternative avenue express speech. 

Source: relates COVID-19, think we're really going wait see SCOTUS says real long term questions viability restrictions. Several businesses live closed permanently shutdown stores due restrictions hard-hit compared states cities. people cannot make living Congress willing put aside differences find compromised solution, people either going start going hungry going work anyway.

That said, States take restrictions far. States banned buying seeds (early on) driving cars ridiculous.

Small, shitty fines like $50 encourages idiots. Make fine something like $10,000.00 *maybe* people might start wearing masks properly. Maybe. True, examples gave places eradication ever option. COVID eradicated literally country border, let alone US already prevalent areas India hope ever avoiding worst effects virus.

I agree worked decently well select areas. still think South Korea approach sustainable widely applicable. model.

Wish best luck this! often though, particular flu. essentially vanishes, lurking isolated cases and/or natural reservoirs. ""China even went far kick international journalist pandemic its' peek""

Yeah that's true. kicked journalists 3 US news agencies tit tat war America kicked Chinese journalists. really don’t like article. really don’t need discussions hospitals save run ventilators right now. didn’t happen NYC dramatic covid surge doubt it’ll happen highly likely mild flu season. comparing getting flu shot stopping sinking Titanic? Seriously?

I’m saying don’t get flu shot, appointment get mine today, shouldn’t need overly dramatic messaging get point across. even read article? says increasing flu shots decrease number ICU beds used free covid understand every business mom pop shop?

I think outrageous airlines make billions dollars let businesses go ""dont enough cash hand""

I think reasonable tax dollars bail companies could bailed spent last 20 years maximizing payouts shareholders. vaccines miracle cures.  Polio vaccine made polio developed world go feared disease basically irrelevant.  Measles vaccine likewise.  last case mumps heard about?   

We know which, any, covid vaccines might effective polio, measles, mumps vaccines. I'm honestly worried yet. Americans eligible 1st round. We've seen herd mentality US. people get vaccinated start feel free virus, people want that. Employers schools also drive lot later vaccinations, people talk big game generally like risking employment. especially true refuse help covid illnesses unvaccinated people. essentially free liability vaccine available person person refuses it. hear you! need break dishes, hate takeout trash. 
I wish could eat outside safely restaurant, disabled child can't really take along. Maybe we'll go shifts weather gets tolerable here, state poorly.

I definitely hear buying gift cards restaurants may likely go under... main argument inside selling illegal traced. see would two prevent someone it, called fraud, exists main motive, profit.

Pretty damn smart dude believes might “smart,” he’s also religious believes Bill Gates going anti God shit. told Elon Musk actively intent planning stick ship head, believe me. dude totally gone.

Yeah might fall face unprotected, that's challenge tool. Anecdotally nothing gut feeling ICU nurse, November December gonna rough. Take grain salt cause gut feelings &lt; epidemiological projections large margin.

Like submarine? don’t get know it. It’s already late start coughing. forget tiny detail last six months?  Yep, you. BLM AntiFa tend wear masks (though may due illegal tear gas) recent right wing protests mostly masks social distancing. ARs tacticool gear proved remarkably ineffective covid19. Anti mask isn’t black white. wear mask outside? what's probability severe lifelong illness COVID-19? know? 


Also, decisions affect people dealing highly contagious disease. choose reckless, please reckless far far away people. couldn’t federal law mandating usage masks? Schools able refuse students get vaccinated contagious diseases like measles, mumps rubella etc. public health. live outside downtown Denver, metric fuck ton restaurants around house. PACKED.... damn near every night. mention hospital restrictions. labor unpleasant. got shift sat group 20 people. everyone forget there’s pandemic restaurants sports back?  Ugh, distinction felt necessary? muddies waters laymen. Bah. Pedantry. definitely saying American work conditions hellish.

I assumed talking averages chance American jobs hellish. Hey, actually responding said instead assuming kind meaning taking every possible precaution.

You asked question answered it. satisfied? incredibly upsetting. seeing number comments around people loving quarantine making unemployment previously dead-end jobs... surprised?

That, high schoolers screaming *possibly* expected go school. also putting high quality air filters classrooms (yes, know expensive, really good ones). help? may finance issue would outfit every classroom high quality air filter capable square footage. would rely AC air exchange. thoughts?

And also UV germicide ones researching second option? median often accurate representation average values dataset mean going skewed outliers data. aren’t Bring back good ole drive ins!!! 😃 well said  Guys, wrong headline

This situation India May, testing capacity terrible, take grain salt People actually looked generally do. 

If hard lockdown 67 days set invasive contact tracing system world close contacts placed mandatory isolation batch testing technology let test 11 million people couple weeks, needed....it would surprising *didn't* low numbers. long would approval take companies hand research regulators? Thanks, they’re rural area hasn’t hit hard yet. They’re extremely high risk makes worrying. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Crazy house parties huge reason numbers got bad California. Stay safe there. parents groups insane. “Muzzles” forced kids.

OK - let's use link:

* Drill [Animal Slaughtering Processing link source.
* Go table ""NAICS 311600 - Animal Slaughtering Processing"",
* Sort ""Employment"", largest numbers first.

How many categories think work meat plant? suspect maybe ""Butchers Meat, Poultry, Fish Processing Workers"" work meat plant? ""Meat, Poultry, Fish Cutters Trimmers""? proportion ""Helpers--Production Workers"" work might plant - half them? ""Miscellaneous Production Workers""? ""Packaging Filling Machine Operators Tenders"" ""Packers Packagers, Hand""?

We already 400,000, even included ""Slaughterers Meat Packers"" 69,810.

This looks lot like cherry-picking order find smallest possible number.

(edit) downvoted fast (&lt; 10 seconds) 100% sure drill calculation. say trying support pre-determined narrative??? Perhaps slightly unethical, use *'it's flu'* folks testing? refuse wear masks even believe virus real dangerous, problem volunteering paid testing research. district going back *looks watch* tomorrow 80% kids. Kids choice stay home. Teachers not. Masks required times... lunch going bit problem.

Not teach person, responsible online classes choose stay home. 

I'm waiting first teacher funeral school. hope isnt anyone families. company recently (2019) laid hundreds middle management positions aren’t experiencing lol nothing Jail time fix. walk around city live awe people would sit clearly social distanced area outside, eat piece chicken. Shit normal people, can't pretend la la land hour, get go eat home like good person... ridiculous comment I’ve read today, congratulations. tell one thing sure, virologist miraculously disappear china. put membership pause local gym aren’t requiring masks work out, implementing social distancing rules. I’m curious, what’s like working mask on? I’ve decided work home outside time guess could experiment home haha haven’t far. wife sense, recovered, she'll take kids ex-wife. That's last thing needs deal article states everyone party already tested positive? thsts true definitely see fault completely really terribly written article call necessity simple case valuing human lives animal lives.

It necessity **because** nearly everyone values human lives animal lives. church business, make money sheep followers, give fuck anyone health. dare someone post /r/vegan Taiwan nation gloat right now. know better. already widespread, contact tracing workable even wanted it.

Also results timing pretty spotty; county SoCal reports M-F, often 25% positve cases days out. Contact tracing useless point, horses left barn. I’m might call water man, Jack! main problem IMO selling small numbers numbers small due like 2mil total Nebraskans. look cases per Mil low. wearing follow rules actually cause. rules say don’t wear sitting down, don’t wear it

Illinois changed interactions restaurant worker.  I'm trying. Hey maybe knew anything ventilators comforted knowing there's one name it

Covid horrible, friend sick hoping ventilator future. able get treatment mean okay, awful seems straight. see problem this. Teachers safely teach classes two people room. access supplies room able communicate co workers. Two teachers one large room lot easier manage definitely remain safe.

Obviously still best students attention span undoubtedly fall, teachers able basically office work in. many new cases day?  seems pretty clear COVID run densely populated areas, moderately populated areas, rural areas. idea midwest somehow ""stupid"" virus infecting sort like looking around forest fire burning tinder declaring area ""bad job"" area road burnt ground ""great job"" fire there. 

In terms death per million (which reliable metric), Dakotas 40th 50. New York NINE times deaths per capita - gap close little, unlikely results anywhere near poor Northeast. 

Anyone somehow thinks NY something right, ND wrong, consuming much media reading enough stats. waiting for? Whose they? gonna use? Whats ""them""? can't understand sentence context. Please help Happy Halloween! Sick treat! things put suit drive work every day. *we* would save lot money one think *the suit people*? population 120million, 4000+ death scared shitless here! 

Do find reasonable response? Coronavirus clearly given sense identity purpose. Imagining return normalcy return mundane you, literally shaking think that. Whatever, pandemic seems ending. wife partially person teaching she’s wearing ton. walked day house lol. walked school, drove 15 minutes home walked house. knows long she’d worn wasn’t home account ever see russian drink water, good reason Mandrake! Argentina's lockdown really seem worked great. Cases still growing. Wrongo Fauci, go theater right pleases so. us non Americans told stupidity everywhere countries anti science beliefs growing. result global neoliberal capitalism. Funding cuts schools, hospitals ect. everywhere. rage fear leads choas. US leader pack, polorization society happening over.

Right bad mask indoors policies enforced. hop onto public transport huge percentage wear masks harder enforce see many anti mask begrudgingly wear one grocery store. types deny climate change science, believe politicians say choice cut funding, raise retirement age ect. drag us down.

I Canada. Ontario. Live outside Greater Toronto Area. know someone lives Toronto living town family town due non mask compliance public transport. small town's bus system basically non mask. even drivers. also know local gov't flouted indoor dining rules back July. Google's covid numbers dont lie. Go check yourself. Really. think surprising. I’m gonna need citation “one droplet make sick” claim  think what’s even worse really didn’t much save lot lives. Wear mask, wash hands, limit social gatherings. digging graves anti-maskers symbolic part. Like 5 mph over? fine him???

In Australia would $1652 fine every participant. That's minimum fine.

Not paid host, individuals themselves. see hate host, every single fuck head showing mass gathering right deserves punished. know better. least username checks out. do?

Order takeout instead. frustrating, know, always ideal, demonstrably better alternative inside outdoor dining. non-American, I'm genuinely shocked heard people going hungry America due lockdowns. Nothing like happened country, developed nations know of. always read reddit America 3rd world country pretends first world - never actually believed COVID

I agree, hard undeveloped nations lockdown, probably shouldn't. Nahhh Better :) need administrative state. American vote director institution, independently. There's President's cabinet, there's independent adminstrative state. shoul vote CDC directors, HHS director, etc. independently. House Representatives say funding. Administration funding concern White House. apply. Maybe enforcement, that's different issue. usually get sick within couple weeks. usually pretty bad too. I'd rather flu Covid. found CDC altering information fit bias agenda yet still see people social media sub saying things like “numbers going things getting lot better it’s time go back normal sorry d00mers. can’t help wonder many accounts paid ones paid trust numbers. desperation? EXACTLY!!! decade (if ever) idea statistics. Hey! saw post yesterday. Glad decided bring dad appointment. 

I would move forward procedure. Getting rid cataracts greatly improve dads quality life vision alone. surgical staff completely covered PPE, likely including N95 masks. likelihood patient getting covid low, precautions. Provisional count: Look kids died. Fatality age: estimated death rate 40 .01%: study: THAT'S FUCKING AMERICAN.

***look fast car goes!!!!***

/FREEDUMB!!! Yep. two factions anti-vaxxers Covid particular: reject science, pro science that's problem originates, lack trust science followed sufficiently. 

I'd like squarely blame everyone who's turned vaccine political football, everyone who's undermined confidence American medical safety institutions. safe well-tested vaccine comes out, we'll need work even harder try build trust back get critical mass vaccinated. (If vaccine approved without well tested safe, god help us, know we'll overcome damage public trust would cause.) situation CDC agencies blown trust goodwill already built up. go. Anything else like project? fail see ignorance grandstand online like this. see countries requiring proof vaccination allow in. El Salvador requires negative covid test let now. long left house for? people need punished fullest extent law. I’m sick shit  concur, mostly. genome virus sequenced? 

It seem so, bet article would've made point case. Determining original infection subsequent reinfection genomic differences seems way confirm true case reinfection now. not, unlikely reinfections. 

I also mostly agree, address fact genomic sequencing can't determine reinfections occur exact strain virus. problem is, believe technique right distinguish reactivation, biphasic / multiphasic behavior. 

Still considering reported cases, likelihood erroneous cases due false positive testing, reactivation, long-tail virus behavior, total incidence rate true reinfections seems small. Please post horse shit. incredibly counter-productive. Rong aid.  Trump propaganda? I’m talking Biden winning? lot happen 4 years. People seem think America somehow immune problems plague parts world, sort inherent code protects America. doesn’t. elect would despot guess what? get despot. 

The sentiment “Trump shake things make people vote better candidates” prevalent last election came place extreme arrogance. America’s entire involvement world war 2 4 years. world changed 4 years forever. 4 years isn’t long except is. Trumps administration fast tracking nation worst possible scenario. 

Your vote matters. Use wisely. Funny, agree different reasons

The constant negativity fear-mongering becomes less powerful anybody it. He's TV every single day harping end times, lots people already stopped listening. I'd say slowing lack testing might, maybe, (oh, know) EVERYTHING IT?!? State one them, can't really anything half population brainwashed. going literally gym, hour everyone left, wearing good mask. Re: ventilation, think guys done anything different before. city (population 200,000) ~50 cases day.

I'll go tomorrow. feel confident, I'll pause membership resume later date safe.

I went check today literally one wearing mask people literally hanging rafters full. Luckily owner close friend allowed come off-hours work alone. even enough, I'll stop. Haha, okie doke. sure Russian bot would encourage voting, hey long fun mental gymnastics. Take care, bud!  oh - one who's funded yeah. 

lols. I've pretty much alluded too, mostly sake hope sure know motivate staff. Excellent managing. Lol you’re repeating trump propaganda. virus won’t magically go away less severe. Use brain. Going walks 1) one wearing masks distancing 2) there's nothing distract stressing everything, making worse. It’s like someone put Oprah charge thing is, valid reason firing her, although it’s bit bullshit call small pocketknife weapon.

Edit: Folks, supporting firing. think whole thing bullshit. BUT, rules broke them. saying legal standpoint broke rules legal reason. post first thing read morning, that's entirely possible. apologies m8 Big 10 report later retracted (not sure valid retraction - basically tweet reporter said original physician retracting statement) say original report referencing study stated 15% athletes COVID-19 Myocarditis - alarming, many people heard 'oh, Big 10 retraced statement, everything fine'.

By way, athletes high school basketball players dropped dead middle games years past, almost always attributed Myocarditis. lot eager lawyers happy take employment opportunity. I’m NH frequently find jealous Vermont. one times. equating, closely related view. equal would synonyms, aren't. Yes think that’s right. remember months ago tests didn’t work, analogy, car totaled back then. wore mask inside would drastically reduced completely 0 hard time staying positive. coworker today yet wear mask, others everyday noses. It’s making rage angry it’s hard. pandemic really shown stupid weak lot people are. Shit do. :( difficult get person understand something salary/preferred election outcome/ability go tailgate party depends understanding it.  Yeah think think disagreeing you, not. I've seen people wearing swim goggles.  Transmission via eye thought major vector compared respiratory droplets. Though, technically possible contract via eyes.  probably personal choice much risk/discomfort willing accept point, risk already relatively low everyone distanced, wearing masks, ventilation set correctly. got mask mandate capital city state &amp; nobody enforces it. makes ragey.
I bought reusable N95 mask protect myself. expensive less ER copay would be. Also less would lose pay isolate exposure it’s worth it.
Envo mask. Made NH. Apparently rule broke. Rite Aid rule. Honestly, poorly US done every aspect covid pandemic far, fully expect deep freezer manufactures install heating elements mistake. honestly wouldn’t assume doctors (GPs) final authority virology epidemiology. February doctor told COVID stuff overblown, lol. Election Lives 

Except might still lose lmao Social media gives bullhorn people bad intentions gives unlimited anonymous direct access minds many Americans. plant seed system zombies rest. 

Your opinion neighbor, friend, relative anymore. colored hijacked political system designed divide sow misinformation widely successful we're approaching 200,000 deaths. Something tragic unify country instead fighting other. blame Ask put hold membership feel comfortable going. Lots online videos body weight workouts meantime Another 'patriot' brushing 190K dead americans. 


(Sorry, SplooshMountainX, stole comment perfect. hope forgive reusing it.) Make dig graves. Ignorant stupid people appropriately punished actions said anything haircuts? Actually havent left house, token life goes cannot stay locked away ever. Thats importance social distancing, hand washing mask wearing comes play.  from? I’ve literally flown around country make sure check you’re wearing mask. I’ve seen flight attendants ask people put Masks back eating. don’t play can’t take anymore...how people anti science?

Anything back-justify inane ramblings Trump puts there. It’s impossible discuss politics speaking covid US. intertwined every single way respect that, you’ve got living course would carried please.

But trauma nurse level 1 unit it’s fucking horrific feeling, knowing maybe vent would tie patient eventual recovery, can’t damn thing except inform family. Cases like haunt me. think it’s pine box Undertaker made threw Hell Cell plummeted 16 ft announcer's table back 1998. Hope sue Rite Aid, fresh ripe bullsheet right here. course understand economy health intertwined. Based US law, lack intent absolve murder. That's different degrees murder law books. 

We never healthy economy without healthy populace, seem understand that. reopening solving anything. 70% Americans comfortable traveling air dining indoors. effective treatments, (vaccine timelines ridiculously optimistic) anything close full economic recovery.

I really wish Jerome Powell man word. Months ago promised US government would everything power stave mass personal small business insolvency, even meant literally printing money. sad horrible travesty richest nation world, social safety net emergency.  Spanish Flu contagious basic seasonal flu today is.

Spanish Flu R0 approx 1.8-1.9 (supposedly, think may bit higher).

Past seasonal influenza viruses similar (H2H2, H2N3, return H1N1) R0 1.3 generally.

C19 R0 roughly 3, varied based clade. 

And course R0 varies general based many factors like population density.

Edit: Influenza R0 numbers based seasonal peak (fall/winter). Spanish Flu R0 dropped off-season, still remained 1. Banana republic shit daily administration. 2 people remember East Germany (and Soviet bloc) Reddit. sad. CDC used premier public health institution, still funding good people Trump degraded even them. That's itfr perceive s/he nothing without personal gain. assume fox hunting peasant flogging also okay. casual sex unless droit du seigneur. three year old loves masks. got crazy excited made first ones her, always asking make masks match outfits. super cute. almost feel bad never letting leave house opportunity wear public. look CDC numbers - would look Johns Hopkins. never relied CDC. 

There multiple states US would highly suspect of. doubt person watching fox news Ah issue. equating freedom/liberty free Yes, first participants course received second doses months ago least indication safety month-half year basis. risks missing things rush need calculated.

'what odds first 20k participatnts getting anything 4/3/2/1 months, chances last participants still get something last remaining months till every participant least 6 months second dose. Sticks stones Scientists... sticks stones. hit really hurts actually win fight instead pointing fingers saying mean things? Citation needed Well would say COVID mostly endemic. definitions tricky. seeing explosive growth associated epidemics outbreaks right now.

I say COVID ""over,"" epidemic passed places. data paints picture. 8 years, *if we’re lucky.* it’s saying that. article literally says won’t enough vaccines 2024. everyone knows even vaccines distribute make sure they’re actually effective even begin thinking opening up. take 4 years least. Would rather catch covid die, permanently disabled constant agony damaged organs, live lockdown years safe disease? Kids rarely die bet death count atleast 250,00 see scientists use word ""theory"" immediately confuse night cousin/dad Billy-Bob got drunk muttered ""so theory..."" [**Some**] People social distancing, wearing masks, making safe choices


FTFY. Depends numbers. spent months trying drag relatives kicking screaming acknowledging reality... think people emotionally incapable processing pandemic. give shit more. People bored this. That's it. that's spike, OK. that's beginning rising curve... thanks. chances hospitalized first place low though. Also heart inflammation thing taken context [perfectly context viral infections. God bless America Excellent. Thanks resources, really appreciate it. I’ll take look week educate myself. call talked cold storage issues maybe it’s non issue simply misunderstood.

I admin stuff small IP nonprofit almost presence South Dakota, you’re interested networking, please dm me. also share slides you, since they're classified, like. thought really interesting conversation, although went head.
It looks like flu vaccine H1N1 meant stored roughly temps 35-46F. idea new one stored different temp? 8 years online school. Yeah work problem. everything else shutdown 8 years hahaha good fucking luck. stay 2020's like. 

We atleast one vaccine starts getting used limited quantities end year. First half 2021 probably much wider use. Hate them, trust them, get one, whatever like rest world move on. choice refuse treatment. think lot people would disagree though. Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand dealt virus. Forget lockdowns - that's policy. Look mobility - that's behavior. Korea high mobility compared say, Japan. high. testing system caught many clusters. Japan REFUSES test, likes pretend exist. Japan large outbreak (though likely 10,000 died March/April lie say 1000 did), MOBILITY low. People staying home. Korea. Yet Korea better outcome?? Oh, Korea tests! traces isolates.

It's damn simple. USA country excuse, since test trace isolate state sized effort, states legal border controls other. But, spite excuse, USA sucks. Europe, now, sucks. Taiwan lying, they're well anyway. Korea best example, New Zealand low populated island protests, Vietnam politcally communist harsh lockdowns. Korea democracy, island, protests also compliance, strong, adaptive test, trace, isolate program. Korea containing it. Korea measuring stick. USA sucks. UK handling it. Korea mobility decrease Japan has. Japanese, spite assholes government, staying home. Sounds like something something east bloc WW2. must've sucked fat tall decades field without public knowing family receiving death threats decides wants 15 minutes fame? Seems like found paid shrill. Who’s paying you? China? Russia? Republicans? Clearly. else would saying dumb stuff end front news article? Don’t look rosy side? kinda doomed logic that?? don’t think eating inside “fine” anyway? Air naturally moves around space therefore virus moves around. think it’s naive self serving believe eating inside safe okay. Certainly eating farther apart safer it’s safe. 60 respondents recovered, average time recovery 27 days. respondents recovered managed symptoms 40 days average, dealing health problems 5 7 weeks. report shows chance full recovery day 50 less 20 injury relatively common patients COVID-19, accounting 7%-23% cases, associated higher rate morbidity mortality 100 recovering patients included study, 67% recovered home, evaluated mean 71 days confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, 78% demonstrable cardiac involvement via cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, 76% detectable high-sensitivity troponin, 60% evidence active myocardial inflammation abnormal native T1 T2.

But Fox News, fake news.

I view Corona acid test ideology vs reality. Faith Based community makes world Jesus protect Spitting mask face aweful link suggests overstating number employees 6X? Maybe investigative reporter exposed blatant lying explains earth overstating 6X helps propagandizing? part propaganda I'm sure, part politics sure enough

still, better die weapons manufacture's pockets Meaning agrees base punishment. Aka basis retribution. 

Basically, punishment fits (idiotic) crime, might also help open eyes punished. live action disney remakes trash Things pretty grim, though. 200,000 people dead winter coming. Reckless behavior late Summer suggests lot people going sick Fall Winter. There's way sugar coat it. People going die people's pig-headed stubbornness. Fauci keeps trying warn us. must frustrating him, ignored something important. right thing pulling knife pepper spray defend herself. customer beaten death Rite Aid anti-weapons policy done good. get another job, cant get another life. friends different state seeing would require traveling staying family? I’ve visited immediate family couple times since June, there’s difference seeing them, seeing friends. makes wide bubble.

Never mind gas stations etc. This. order something online magically shows tomorrow. People overestimate logistics challenge. point lol. trying instill people? I'm also sure downvoted me. really think need get outside. sucks there’s people refusing follow guidelines all, I’m glad it’s mostly rural areas giant metropolitan areas. metropolitan areas acted way rural areas pandemic, it’d devastating. I’m pleasantly surprised *most* people populated areas taking seriously. good bad? Fl tx decreasing cases might reach low plateau. numbers back June IIRC, little higher now. mean, that's nothing new. Minnesota still large rural population. He's still gonna lose state, like last time. I'd bet it. president use defense production act. cdc can’t go things rational. historical psychological perspective academic world demonstrated sort thing unfortunately common many previous pandemics.

 state epidemic lasts status quo incumbent governments tend consolidate, warn sharp increase social instability aftermath epidemic expected.  historical evidence shows epidemics display potential disarranging effect civil society along three dimensions,"" authors write.

* First, policy measures tend conflict interest people, generating dangerous friction society institutions.
* Second, extent epidemic impacts differently society terms mortality economic welfare, may exacerbate inequality.
* Third, psychological shock induce irrational narratives causes spread disease, may result social racial discrimination even xenophobia.

A rise irrational behaviour shown third point seems unfortunate part human nature.

The USA, even countries, seems 3 3 checkpoints. almost like everything could done bring 3 things done, max.

If pattern holds see 'sharp increase social instability' pandemic might soon wish back good old peaceful days 2020 main quinfecta people follows: Greed, cruelty, selfishness, corruption, deception.

What see ideals **cruelty** **deception**. cruelty ideal, strongly believe cruel unusual punishments. wish sunlight shined upon malfeasance. goal deceive hide cruelty. wonder would feel revisit comment you’re preparing intubated watching one loved ones slip abyss.

That’s able feel comfortable current situation years. Teachers need demand hazardous duty pay. $$$  tiny rise % positivity, may may significant. 

Compare daily case counts daily death counts right cases preceding deaths, would seen upward trend sometime Mid-August. But, essentially flat since July.  I'm really glad seeing especially article nature even suggested inhaled vaccines surmise respiratory mucosal vaccine strategy capable inducing responses directly respiratory mucosa effective early control clearance SARS-CoV-2. particularly relevant high-risk elderly populations, require particularly robust vaccine strategy. regard, respiratory mucosal vaccine strategy COVID-19 may draw successful experience respiratory mucosal delivery influenza, measles TB vaccines humans. Respiratory mucosal vaccination also advantages needle-free requiring much smaller dose parenteral route. However, compared parenteral route, fewer vaccine platforms safe effective respiratory mucosal vaccination. Furthermore, use inhalational devices respiratory mucosal delivery may potentially limiting factor widespread application resource-poor settings.

And earlier article, mentions Respiratory muscosal vaccines produce strong type T-cell response offered good protection sars-cov-2 (in vitro) whereas intramusclar injections failed produce type mucosal vaccination induces strong lung TRM cell responses, whereas parenteral vaccination fails so. Experimentally, airway TRM cells elicited respiratory mucosal vaccination offered robust protection SARS-CoV infection

So would actually expect called second generation vaccines effective older people may offer stronger protection sars-cov-2 vaccines, research definitely needed shown work humans.

I honestly wouldnt surprised Oxford Imperial college inspired paper definitely cause optimisim  Yeah...Outhouses intended moved usually hole ground underneath structure. many reasons use indoor plumbing outhouses really exist anymore.

People thread implying portapotties outhouses thing much not. Unclear due lack education, culture, vocabulary. side, AgNPs exposure human cells induces cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, inflammatory response human cells cell-type dependent manner. raised concerns regarding use AgNPs therapeutics drug delivery. summarized emerging endeavors address current challenges relation safe use AgNPs therapeutics drug delivery platforms. Based research done far, believe AgNPs engineered increase efficacy, stability, specificity, biosafety biocompatibility.

They go say believe safe future certain mechanisms. 

They also block types meds hrmm thats also knockin part population. thought one last things heard regarding treatments therapies steroids helped decrease mortality significant amount like 30 something percent thought sinopharm one find sarcastic. think wife operate little better space, also working another problem: much stuff, discount shopping, hoarding - *The American way!* full swing Marie Kondo lockdown hit. Time start questioning gain keeping us locked fear? Research connections come conclusions. goal better better marketing segmentation. better understand existing market segments better sell you. sister keeps telling everyone definitely back December... except... remember illness. mother, father, sister nasty flu-like illness symptoms, quarantined away home week want it. mom hospitalized it—*twice.* know *know* COVID? mom tested flu tested positive Influenza-A gorram hospital... yet sister still refuses believe anything COVID attempt justify risky behavior. Go ahead back claim evidence That's relief! go back normal now!

/s Coronavirus may reached ~~California~~ China even China announced outbreak, ~~study~~ common sense says went saying unwillingly passing COVID murder talking recklessness open businesses. 

""If actively engaged activities could potentially lead death, murderer.""

That logic wrong comes viruses since said before, carriers 100% innocent legally absolutely everything pass virus mistake. IMHE predictions make sense never have. weird unexplained kinks sudden slope changes graphs occur future dates, indicates something really wrong models. possible gets significantly worse fall winter, would make significant increase deaths start occurring Jan-March, next 1-2 months. get it. There’s vaccine.

In previous pandemics, previous endemic infectious diseases, everyone infected. 

I think vaccine eventually. Even partially effective, provides immunity limited time, vaccinated difference severe case mild case (as looking likely, given recent developments) I'll wait vaccine. Another factor longer go getting infected, time available doctors discover effective treatments.

All reasons throw hands join people acting like virus thing anymore. ""holding breath"" rational. sub wants virus continue benefits use tool. Notice many screaming vaccine summer possibility one comes say get become anti-vaxxers spouting arguments anti-vaxxers used likes MMR vaccine decades random Trump stuff thrown in.   Yeah well.

Mostly referred ""unconfirmed"". confirmed.  

What mechanism used ""confirm"" persistent infection new infection?

I'm sick reading articles define way determined. posts made Aquarium subreddit, photos started. Invest hobby, use evening thinking color angel fish getting tomorrow. 12 them, like 12 Monkeys, stay pandemic style lol Trailer Park Boys popular show Canada then? types ""sucking"" referring brand's ad serving tactics strategy. Honestly lot brands badly. bought fossil watch couple years back, retargeted months facebook ad showed *exact* watch bought myself.

More question, ad serving platform place coherent ad strategy, everyone gets right. companies even typically strategy beyond ""Reach"" reach many people target audience possible, target audience defined Everyone 18-65.

A careful considerate ad strategy worth lot money, honestly big bucks are, potential returns high. ""Hey guys, mandatory pizza party."" Comply, citizen. - forced labor increased risk infection. Coronavirus giving everyone excuse indulge totalitarian urge. Damn, Rite Aid looked like updated since 1994. Oh god yes, I'm extrovert. People checked frequently start lockdown knew and/or met parties shit knew dancing, talkative, social butterfly. I've hated shit can't wait 2022 whenever lol I'd argue death possiblity arising simply gathering right now, gathering peaceful. Still seems like lot people. Especially since working. Honestly shouldn’t even visited family guess I’m perfect whatever. Still. Less better reddit seems agree lol.

Listen, either I’ll make alive without ruining life, won’t, it’s simple that. It’ll whatever is. “Bla bla bla things control things can’t” What’s alternative. No, can't make 250 million doses overnight, need two doses thats 500 million. US can't selfish stupid keep instead distributing health workers old ppl globally always wanted big aquarium stumbled apon used 450 l iron holder ridiculous amount managed get delivered somehow 3 men barely managed lift 1st floor. March, ghat, every month added sth, filter, C02, plants. 100 community fish, glo tetras, cardinal tetras, plecos, glo zebras (we bought new lights lid, took black light told glo fish glow dark, awesome lol). Wanted make blackwater biotope, figured serious want fish glow, happy jungle water. Learned UV light bought fish desinfect N95, cool lol Look data population normalized. Right 50% daily deaths, daily cases. Even though US faring quite poorly, Brazil suffering considerably worse. title go like this: Coronavirus may started California reaching China it’s first identified. Prior Covid, walk bank mask? Genuinely asking snark intended.
Edit: would still love hear whether entered bank, even gun shop, mask pre-Covid. Thanks advance.  Maybe early 2022

I don’t expect effective (70% better) vaccine widely distributed late 2021

The first vaccines likely limited efficacy distribution didnt see anyone wearing masks flu cold season, distancing slow spread protect elderly compromised. wear one?

What forced people spread cold coming work bury graves, CDC estimates that, mid-March, 29,000 59,000 died due influenza illnesses. I’m saying go away, I’m saying tone shift make feel like LOL, still like 20% generic drug supplies. Drug production pretty diverse globally, world relies raw materials China. That's real issue dont know change easily case didn’t make plain, guys: quarantine means no, it’s okay host party even held quarantining. Absolutely terrible distressing read about, definitely cannot say unexpected Florida Man. What's strict Swedish regulations? Virtually every restriction Sweden guide lines. cops fining complying. Employers businesses held certain standards otherwise nothing enforced all. limiting US FDA approved vaccines. Neither approved US. Dengvaxia, several US researchers cautioned officials potential dangerous side effects Philippines released it. tracking phone.... especially connect free wifi.  

As larry ellison said.  ""Privacy? privacy. get it"" chart shows influenza pneumonia. Pneumonia deaths far outstrip flu deaths numerous causes pneumonia. Couuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurse! expect crowded baseball games rock concerts spring/summer 2021. Imagine waiting vaccine company dozen lawsuits record  Rite Aid still exists?  Says dude thinks Bill Gates trying microchip us. Research complicated issue. likely seeing super weak effect blood type interesting scientific view medical practice. contrast malaria cholera, difference outcome blood type clinically signficant. receptor, antibody, clotting capacity differences various cell lines also express blood type. guy always posting stupid shit looking genuine answer always comes along shits anything remotely serious bc he’s doesn’t brain. title reads though early days pandemic.... today time:

 **6,741,528** confirmed US cases.

 **198,848** US deaths. 

You talking brick wall dude warnings. read lot whole thing , helps Honestly think Sweden blessing disguise bad reputation rest Europe. stayed home. Nobody wanted came here, didn’t go abroad nobody wanted us countries... Shit like par course retail doctor called couple weeks ago said tested positive.
1. Never test
2 Doctor since last December. could use anything weapon, yes? wine opener pocket tool. shove someone it’s weapon. really isn’t weapon tool? Actually not. Manager likely fired time reason long unlawful. There's per se law prohibiting employer firing worker defending work. 

It's stupid company argue insurance requires employees fight back customers. 

The US labor system fucked came master-slave system. little rights company policy brandish knives? Rite Aid metal realized. think you’re infectious diseases expert, it’s probably smart exclusively consider prepare worst case scenarios. Maybe member general public it’s good mental health look light end tunnel. public health professional virologist, it’s probably best skeptical pessimistic. That’s emergency risk management works. possible covid-19 eventually mutate much milder (as lower death rate lower hospitalization rate)? 


If happen would isolation lockdown longer required? Yup, parents went door restaurant similar experience. everyone sitting masks wouldn’t know virus. said didn’t enjoy constantly thinking virus. Found idiot still know deaths lag cases. like 6 months shit. Come fuck on. S. Korea took virus seriously day 1 comprehensive playbook. Among countries besides China, developed first large scale testing program, drive testing centers many creative ways sanitizing them, detailed contact tracing, well contact tracing apps, actually quarantine sick people hospital get better (very important) well charge people money treatment, banned mask export immediately ramped KF-94 mask PPE production. also transparent populace status outbreak goals -- people high compliance mask wearing everything else. know Europe, US basically opposite every one points -- made hard get tests, administration lied outbreak tried say would get better people go work sick, still PPE mess, people charged treatment, told wear masks (at first), never banned 3M suppliers filling foreign orders, contact tracing abysmal. first weeks outbreak, exponentially increasing, testing centers people made wait lobby hours next coughing people. He’s wrong, it’s actually greater 98% knew shot. Next! I'm experts speaking keeping public ignoring problem, believe wording off. Telling us look rosy things, another article claiming could first many pandemics always answer.

Believe me, I'm practicing toxic positivity. people sub seem confuse celebrating positives taking virus seriously. That's case. We're middle global pandemic could spiral control even catastrophic let guard down. hope mean vigilant. Expect worst, hope best. That's motto.

I respect opinion, please assume shred positivity hope way toxic. I'm telling anyone take mask let guard down. holding hope trying celebrate positives sad time world. That's fantastic. Yeah, family Montana talked like month ago telling symptomatic get tested. Even healthcare workers tested. true, know. That's told though. Oregonian here.

My personal bubble me, gf, dog, couple guinea pigs. vigilant; Oregon's done fairly well pandemic, I'm starting see signs fatigue. Fewer people wearing masks biggie.

I'm guessing household roughly halfway this, see vaccine personal endpoint nightmare. tragedy people dropped guard got infected early next year.

I think...we're probably *close*, guys. want make mistakes. I've put much effort this, infection would go badly me. know herd immunity you? argue colleges marginally safer reopen elementary schools. Yeah, parties social gatherings 18 year olds unsafe follow mask/distancing rules events, that's irrelevant - long rules followed classrooms quite safe. Dorms bit different, necessity functioning classes.

Elementary schools? that's dangerous. Kids cesspools, there's way teachers successfully make follow rules.


Unfortunately, corrupt collegiate buerrcrats gotten many schools deeply debt schools forced scam students pay professors semester. mean scam opening dorms collect fees closing dorms covid outbreaks, knew would happen, keep fees added refund addendum housing contracts one looking. Yeah, get people acting like they're still lockdown. places, least US, never really even truly locked anyway. could always go outside. honestly sound like basement dwellers call anyone think things exactly pre-pandemic.

How dare ever leave house. literally impossible cover things level. virus stop news blocked. That's lesson learned early stage pandemic. there's, say, 1k patients government choses covering let society runs like nothing happening. number soon grow exponentially 10k, 100k, 1m... reaches certain level (like 10% population), everyone know truth since likely know someone symptoms around you. There's way hide that, even hardiest news suppression latest technology.

Of course there's another possibility people China massively infected asymptomatic patients government trouble hiding facts. that's case, what's big deal? CDC reporting daily, stopped. numbers off, course number deaths much higher least something go off. Ordering food takeout also causes spread virus, lower rate eating outdoors. living apartment building elevator. many risk factors, based scientific understanding aerosolization virus, 6 feet distance enough limit person person transmission (in fact distance may less 6 feet good rule) see says ""And try look rosy side things"". Maybe cut video. really believe Fox see excess deaths chart Sweden never goes orange (50%), red (100%) deep red (200%) colors.

The following European countries excess deaths Sweden: Italy, Spain, Belgium, UK, France Netherlands.

""But COVID deaths!!!"" No, excess deaths. COVID, causes. official ""died COVID"" numbers inflate COVID deaths create disparity since countries count those.

It might surprise know Sweden counts non-COVID related deaths COVID deaths even die COVID related causes.

Excess deaths metric cannot played with. Rich people: LOL Unbelievable. need bring sick dying Mexican refugees. hospitals overrun, resources, Americans selfish share them. mean 'vote right way' you? I.e. vote would vote for. Yeah. That's whole issue. Luckily listen likes Donald Trump come health.🤷 Come everyone Reddit scientist said pandemic 8 years !

Ignorance bliss.

Oh BTW lots done avoid right things. Trump want panic words belive single thing says? Mitt Romney campaigned Russia biggest geopolitical threat US, rather China. widely ridiculed time. think even malicious that. agree science (due raised, due selfish reasons) WANT true. ego indoctrination combined willful ignorance. agree you, find shocked, appalled, knocked speechless time see someone post comment 'Meh, 1,000+ dead day, that's nothing! problems here!' (essentially). 

Just.  WOW. making unfounded statements outright scarificed people care homes, putting morphine nothing else died thousands.

Wait, thing said shouldn’t do. wasn’t sob story. promise. could afford more, didn’t need live good life. Ah ok thx much input (appreciate based science). think I'll tell work outside balcony comes over.

How much think risk transmission inside would mitigated wore mask inside? fundamental difference jumping bridge. Breaking legs result physics, laws universe (the laws universe ALSO restrict free even want get that, mention passing). Yes make choice jump bridge consequences, disagree there.

Again ask look definition free Wikipedia. Impediment key word here.

Getting fined government result laws enacted people. People government making choice make harder people something (such open restaurant). using power others restrict people able do. government literally weld doors restaurant shut surround cops military. physically prevent opening restaurant! restriction free will? usually go far, threat consequences usually enough people make choice government wants make. see slippery slope rights/liberties/free fundamentally disagree.

You narrow black-and-white view free cannot restricted anyone, unless maybe physically restrain jail tie down.

I fundamentally disagree view definition. free debated thousands years, understand different viewpoints subject. I'll leave that. think two-party system one big problems. country two-party system like USA? 

Unfortunately political change US requires corporate sponsorship. Authors credentials past  laws place make sure actions, done individual, negatively effect individuals.

Meanwhile, here's latest case/death charts Tennessee, running 7-day currently 30.08 deaths per 100k population. ranks 31st among US states per capita expect people leave house 5 years virus small chance killing even causing noticeable effects?

I'm point wear mask around people try keep things enjoy.

Theres balance living taking precautions keep others safe. federal government fund factories. governments ordered several vaccine candidates condition doses delivered, whether approved not. promised pay full price dose (much upfront pay development testing) even vaccines useless. Whether companies vaccine baby formula syringes, they'll get money. ZERO risk involved ramping production now. Trial in_MD tho. also stop enforcing taxation businesses? would much appreciated well. also makes sense. going gym, mask going shit. bodily fluids, people panting sweating, touching surfaces.

A gym binary thing me. Either it, don't. Trying social distance wear masks gym ""feel good"" gesture nothing more. episode Parks Rec water fountain documentary. posted sentiment general discussion post sub ago. husband thinks vaccine rolls out, people go back normal. 'new normal' old normal. met warmest reception, lets real. 

after Pandemic 1918, Roaring 20s born, im sure people thought 'new normal' would follow that. 9/11, people thought airline industry finished, less 3 years 9/11, number people flying all-time high. think natural humans like, ""fuck it"" go back whatever before. 

we can't stay home forever. people say should.. privilege. work home long cushy office job effected industries shutting operations can't support work home environment struggled due pandemic. i'm seeing job right now. ton business schools local governments, since they're open... really suffering. SIL furloughed months works company provides food supplies, accounts schools. friend works commercial real estate is.... good place right now. 

im science safe flatten curve -- realistically know last forever.  agree. US, we've holding 40,000 new cases diagnosed daily, around thousand deaths per day. People say still first wave, given we've never, mean never, gotten semblance control, thing? first wave going blend second here. Making waves indistinguishable. cares call it? many sources outside CDC virus data though. people posting data actually care click links life moving people died covid?

I dont think lack headlines going make feel less dead. test less find, opposite. NY testing 100.000 per DAY. positivity rate months, around 1%.

I'm sure Sweden test more, want ot system Denmark get tested everyday without anyone asking questions. One single test cost $100 $300 depending type test. Multiply millions tests.

Also think numbers Denmark matters, long one ends hospital dies. Sweden uprise summer, resulted change deaths. long danes Spain people actually dying fine.

Ugh, ridiculous... kids really incapable surviving home alone parent out? mean, yeah single digit aged kids probably need supervision, 10yo, 12yo really need babysitter? like one party two faces.

We’re stretched limits we’re willing sacrifice strangers. one signed justice league. need steadying guidance great leader like Homer Stokes. ""Keep Sunny Side Life"" motto, clearly stood little man.

Well, mean maybe that's needed appeal semi-literate yokels backwoods Mississippi. Educated adults probably prefer honest well-considered truth gleefully dismissive hand-waving. Thats exactly told husband!  cut stabbed customer, even though customer wrong, ensuing lawsuit would leveled rite aid definitely would labeled deadly weapon.  husband put cardioversion fib...he went hospital pleased environmental aspects personal aspects protected. Hope Dad feels better soon!!  want. safe area go problems that. trust anyone less crazy idea need comply regulations despite little government support economic capacity so. would put electorate charge jobs can't comprehend properly? Science positions appointed merrit, votes. judges sherriffs; elected positions either. Right. That's worries me. 
I watched meetings letting pro-business interests dictate health policy Placer county still active infection, basically post-viral syndrome get virus including flu. case seems linger quite awhile. instance get chest pain, pounding heartbeat, nerve ""pain"", oversensitivity, fatigue. made general living quite bit less fun. Build, equip &amp; staff. sure ""quality control"" like. that's days/weeks fix, 4 years. Unless ""get rich quick"" company screws whole thing way DeLorean factory was. That’s said southern USA months ago.

How’d turn out? Sadly, we're seeing around world way hard way many people. :( True unnecessary risk. hanging distance came offered hang balcony works home. initially going offer realized really know start comes risk inside longer periods. things government completely screwed year we're actually thinking going rolled effectively? Fat chance. True risk mitigation students campus first place. could kept got little effort, didn't.

How? virus already USA Europe late 2019 Chinese authorities came openly. Stop living fantasy aren’t enough masks, alternative? 85% people r/coronavirus ^ sure comment gets downvoted? 


There question elderly Sweden sent hospital. instead given lethal cocktail morphine sedatives died.


Those questions Google ""covid palliativ vård"" find many examples old Swedes euthanized.

Here one Know what? Sadly, numbers cite first wave. Good guy gop trump, that's vote him. tells like is!

/s Good you. I’m much realistic BoS basically everything said European organization. concern downplaying virus, grifter king, admitted downplaying virus republicans getting rid stock order avoid loss due virus. people stupid selfish!!! GA, we're going right back fill capacity church services, night services, open nurseries! He’s saying underestimate pandemic. People swayed disinformation think it’s flu it’s not, much deadly. shouldn’t say stuff like climate. important thing say, do.

If claim 0 cases period still enforce strict controls, likely cover up.

If announce low infection numbers lift restrictions, truly control.

The latter likely happening China now, shown many foreigners Youtube. survey 4 months ago? Yeah, know ""told"". actually wrong, that's told. Funny thing internet, anybody say whatever want to.

Standards higher. directions. provide complete seal, can't protect *you*. material N95, much leakage protect fully. tried wearing KN95 mask? still smell things breath? strong sign can't fully protect you. 

A large amount engineering went design [N95 largest hurdle seal. That's NIOSH-approved N95 respirators big bands go around head. N95s fully protect wearers things virus particles, also irritants things, required certain types jobs regulated NIOSH, something like CDC FDA. KN95s thing usually seen medical settings N95 used, available. even lockdown anymore? state locked since May. Sure stuff still closed back then, aside lobbies fast food restaurants everything else open summer seem less people pre-pandemic. wondering about. Like, happens vaccine approved precluded treatment somehow?

(Pfizer) Tahoe region getting swamped Bay area residents renting &amp; buying 2nd homes wait pandemic. keep mind towners still traveling back &amp; forth SF/Silicon Valley Sierra foothills. asymptomatic carrying virus. get supervisors want pandemic end normal business/tourism resume, given limited hospital facilities they're really putting resident's health &amp; safety jeopardy there's resurgence. Interesting hear also case Germany, subreddit reacting uniquely swedish issue. Without economy cities would look like Mumbai.

AIDS? started animals, kill humans better. bullshit around Sweden's strategy die already? Sweden similar, stricter regulations Western Europe since May/June. Lockdown ended May us we've relatively normal summer, live Ireland probably busiest summer ever domestic tourism. 99% sounds like benzo w/d. rest likely anxiety making mountains mole hills. said really reason get test put mind ease. sell one half price, works Canada. 

It basically compass, end points south toward America, I've written ""covid everywhere stay away"". And? mean, wife tested negative, pretty sure it. bunch reasons:

* wife co-worker tested positive (with severe symptoms), worked indoors four straight days right developed symptoms. apparent exposure anyone sick.
* We're religious wearing masks apartment, wife work.
* textbook Covid-19 symptoms, though week. symptoms way worse, aligns generally serious men, weird us since wife always gets sick fall ill.
* minor case aligned recent research indicating wearing mask lead less severe symptoms.
* took Abbot rapid test each, notoriously unreliable, probably moreso folks lesser/no symptoms.

I actively told family tested negative, help ease concerns. sincerely think caught it, thankfully minor case though. Mexico also right Still tough decision happens aforementioned businesses employees shut indefinite amounts time? work covid-19 lab processing resulting specimens. tried bring (meddling) reddit weeks ago. got ass chewed badly deleted comment. 

This shit really happening. astonishing university administrators still figured try regulate student behavior like end making problem worse. kids started online, talking parents whose kids in-class, went school first day excited came home defeated. adjust, I’m sure, many benefits in-person school aren’t right now. 

My kids spin office chairs, gaze window, fidget stuff rooms, go cat cuddles breaks, play Minecraft friends lunch, etc. think might get little used it. way since beginning time? Disease always exist. concerned means, live remotely forever. Every person know (including myself) thought Feb/March tested negative antibodies honest people surgical mask reuse really stupid something think protect start. Instead, want help anyone, ""found out"" mask reuse fine--thats fucking lie, okay, happens best shitty thing do.

But that's works. People want meaningfully good stuff, want piss leg tell raining. people believe shit feels lot better remembering leaders watching us die. US prison labor system Ugly American position mentally back March April. worked much making sick. didn’t help ear condition kid decided come back around April convinced Covid going die.

I ended going doctor politely told making sick worry calm lol

It’s amazing mind us let it. Bannon = Republican = bad

Perhaps expert trying prepare us ignoring problem politically feasible second time around. need hope, need public policy listens medical community say, even much like it.

It's getting people wear masks...we normalizing ignoring experts people dying Stop &amp; Shop aswell  Confirmed cases always going rare, mean reinfection rare. Confirmation requires genetic sequences first second infection, extremely uncommon (many people even get tested first go around, never mind particular virus sequenced). would keep eye anecdotal reports reinfection hospitals rather 'confirmed cases' get sense what's happening, right quite number already reported. decided bring inexperienced consultants places like McKinsey figure get masks distribute them, leading literal billions dollars waste.

That's like hiring artistic consultants tell paint mural...instead hiring actual artists paint said mural. Stay safe hope he’s right Seems like masochistic people working home unemployed think means allowed homes. get talk lockdowns leaders months. Work banana mask night long;

Daylight come can't stay home; economy crash either way. Taxes skyrocket. poor get poorer. RemindME! 10 months 10% Americans believe seen neuroscience field. may less common outside medical field, academia industry contribute scientific literature *and* proprietary results, especially collaboration.

Everything else mentioned really depends job position actually do. data scientist drug company data scientist facebook might use similar techniques different purposes, say data scientist pharmaceutical company isn’t contributing science would rather disingenuous. 

It’s uncommon people engineering work, science, advanced data analysis depending size company, job description, team size. pedantic terminology day, point whether academia industry government, many fields research industry overlap well many job positions engineering/science/math overlap. least 22 US citizens based hotel become infected hotel itself, hosted conference last week prevent virus spreading US army, closed two weeks.

I mean yes I've seen enough movies know malicious implications people think way interesting really are. NSA People Shop Target Division. Looking excess death data Mumbai antibody survey IFR 0.2 put excess cases due coronavirus. highly unlikely excess deaths due coronavirus people die due hunger caused lockdown , excess suicides due job losses income loss due lockdown , going hospital due fear coronavirus.

Assuming 50% infection rate reach herd immunity. 1 million deaths total due coronavirus. Millions die due poverty fear caused 
 lockdown. followed sweden herd immunity model.

I don’t understand take years. took months 2 bill. It’s like year max. I’m amazed anyone kids would think child wouldn’t get infected. I’ll drop children see kid sneeze, immediately know everyone going catch cold. Parents look smile know it’s time stock cold medicines things. 

I swear I’m living different pandemic everyone else. We’re starting understand long term effects virus. I’m putting kids couple lazy, free hours day. I... don’t know.

My suggestion look countries recommending, i.e. Europeans, Chinese, Japanese, etc., simply believe CDC/FDA. Thank God! Thanks uneducated input. Local residents aren’t bothered mostly peaceful protests. protests got violent cops start firing tear gas rubber bullets protesters. point accusing Fauci wanting 15 minutes fame incorrect propaganda spread hoaxers, sure got rest comment from. told stay put 14 days day tested. took one look me, said looked young healthy enough asked go home. took three cases covid facility hospital vehicle. One actually died yesterday. Meijer (midwest supermarket chain) Kroger also staffed union members. SII manufacturing 1b doses AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine end year. sure remaining billion. 

From I've gathered, large scale production began Phase I, means take ~6 months billion doses. So, math long would take manufacturing 7.8 b doses (assuming single doses). However estimate guy given based two doses needed, vaccines need. 

Let's forget, resources available right diverted Covid vaccines. addition, logistical challenges another story. 

I'm expert, I'd money guy knowing reputed SII field. Yes. This. meant culture mask-wearing.

Nobody wears masks sick west. haven’t seen since moved (pre-pandemic) once. sure may someone making liar me, haven’t seen it.  false positive rate 5% pretty significant minority taking test expected positive oh god, send articles, aghhhh. I've gathering scientific articles indoor risk, air circulation, etc. well long term effects. rare nerumuscular disease even though i'm young, neurological effects gathered terrified. 

Yea, expect us go open office 12 people unmasked, despite top management openly talking meeting one day spread surface, airborne. Yet, talks whole team emphasizes cleanings, sanitizer, etc. reopening slideshow, terms ""herd immunity"" ""until proven similar cold/flu"" slides. Also, term ""doom gloom"" thrown around. also thinks since 4 top management members offices going in, ""shows risk"". #rant

Anyway, great private office, that's plus. completely agree necessary selfish think effects. Also fuck blatant gaslighting articles. Look Nick Cordero- may rare happen im even concerned death, im concerned long term effects. Wish ""flattenthecurve"" campaign would come back around. ""we need ass seats"" mentality needs stop. reason rules penalized breaking them.

Lady manages cash business, given ccp training standard issue weapon. 

Also work mostly country anyways, meaning ""no reason"" perfectly valid reason fire someone. quote monkey. havent established form argument. aware people prone cling ""bad sources"" information, based disillusions automatically mean support every conspiratist drivel written individuals mental health issues point said disillusion fabricate wildest theories zero fact based evidence.

learn2logic pleb 100% correct, also think that's lot people turning back Fauci. I'm argue - agree analysis stood Fauci along. trust - option returning office I'd like, want take risk right now. still believe COVID real much risk (I'd idiot assume numbers NY mean coming back)

But believe extent there's ""hunkering down"" there's wearing mask, cautious, living life new normal. Everyone’s attention rightfully seems vaccines atm, updates treatment category? Last saw bunch companies entering phase 3 monoclonal anti-body therapies. updates? people US imperialists think US time \*Sigh\*. mean like H1N1, MERS, SARS-1, HIV, Ebola, etc.

Just don’t understand viruses recombine host later transfers humans, doesn’t mean didn’t happen here. Finland: -6.4% removed incorrect Q1 figure. bingo I’m “pretty sure” pooped whale morning. 4 months hell long time poor people. would make statement suggests one touch, upper class people wanting protect regardless cost others. 

Your last statements seem contrary evidence.  c’mon now, wouldn’t want panic 

/s  criminal!!! Stop imposing politics science. people right know! this? USSR? great USAmerica! Management typically unionized. Rite Aid ""Do Enter"" list. Yeah, downvoted? kinda seems like fact. stop low effort comments like this? plenty schools open haven’t shut Cinderella remake released 2015. 

I even bother watching Mulan anymore bad reviews controversies. I'm also keen seeing Little Mermaid. I've stopped optimistic remakes, especially Lion King (which excited about) turned huge disappointment. April? Sure people find tests then. WANTED get tested, easily find one now. order positive tests people go get tested. Vast majority people going get tested unless believe exposed feel sick.  No, not. still die. draw line murder via unwilling passing airborne disease?

Are saying flu unwillingly pass grandma dies it, commit murder unwillingly pass COVID another grandma dies fact commit murder?

You understand absurdity logic surely? disease cases killer, carrier. Florida (24%) - 15,000 implied infections.

Texas (23%) - 24,000 implied That's strange thing say   joking way husbands joke ménage à trois. serious unless serious. I'd assume Antarctica handling pandemic well ""Some situations"", ""probably"", sounds definitely clear me. soon HHS taking CDC data late July, I've filtering stuff bullshit filter lie? Registration spring start late October earliest lol That's district Wednesdays. Half student's monday's, half Tuesday's, everyone remote Wednesday, cycle repeats Thursday's Friday's. ideal. imagine local governments able raise revenue pay ppe, testing contract tracing without Federal help? One step closer becoming authoritarian government runs China Republicans support Trump secretly want here. Reward enrich loyalists, stifle dissent, demand authority, sanction attacking doesn’t obey, censor, choose dominant race/religions, monitor anything different, demand information revolve around leader says say...... list goes (Coming East Asian studies major.) present, different wrapping paper.  aged well.... call debunked.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* public bunch morons won’t know they’re looking at.  I'm introvert fires smoke West Coast, can't even go outside now, workout garage. past week rough. absolutely depending are. Maybe take walk search good therapist. simple - can't get raw ingredients make masks easily due guess who's trade war. That's NIOSH-approved N95 respirators $10 secondary market, shitty KN95 masks everywhere. That's Canada you. object transference debunked?

[It's highly recent Instagram Live interview Matthew McConaughey, Dr. Anthony Fauci relayed odds contracting coronavirus inanimate objects — otherwise known fomites — high initially believed. “It conceivable,” Fauci said, “but unlikely could get fomites, meaning inanimate objects \[such as\] doorknobs, computers. occur, it’s minor component transmission.”  Denmark seems increasing number infected patients hospitals though. sure that’s something that’s going continue, let’s hope not. 

Having said that, journalists seldom know handle statistics. It’s frustrating follow news... Let guess: Beaver nose? given great chance calm public boost confidence giving information, company chose to. imply? think they’re saying vaccine could ready end year work? sure like say positive things time boost stock prices. Yep. would even think nordics together would benefit (or many?) neighbors contiue consume trade. instance (my swedish perspective) salmon close 100% Norway, forest industry imports lot machinery service contracts Finland Denmark exports much food (grain, meat, sugar) CDC FDA involved way? Ok cool cool. Coming US November. Lmao Soviet Union neighbors mad would sometimes call KGB get neighbors hauled gulag, really want happening Britain? China responsible break, never win back clout lost, accelerated people pulling factories china buy decade midsts massice crop failure, natural disasters, ethnic cleansings communist party power strugles, ongoing border conflict india.

China brutally efficient virus, break facade end it. Yes, yes. Like said work home live lot land. Asking someone mask offering one ""enforcing mandate"". Also, zero tolerance policies retarded I’m really scared trump might still win. It’s caused stress far day day life science agrees virus likely become endemic go away. goal always flatten curve, eliminate entirely. 

Staying locked virus completely gone foolish harm good, especially vaccine. sure leaders care much this. Uh big box stores years. use it, least, get stats people move around stores better optimize layouts product placement. according research: Cases already going isn’t even fall yet.

You delusional think spike cases different everywhere else. western european countries suck much controlling pandemic compared South Korea? S.Korea 51 million people roughly population size France, Spain England. 20k cases less 1k deaths. Canada right all."
