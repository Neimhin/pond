0,2021-11-24," Depends situation me, yeah going avoid stuff care forever, also take unnecessary risks getting sick potentially long term effects make things care problem later. expect wearing N95 mask crowds and/or public indoor places foreseeable future though. Personally skipping airplanes (hadn't really planned fly anywhere anyway) stuff like large indoor concerts mostly keep stuff particularly want do. ones refuse probably middle managers real control life way sticking man. SMH. 

What also bothers fact they're idiotic it. religious groups even given anti-vax stance years. 

My booster shot worst side effects me, 12 hours, good. five-year-old got first shot, he's schedule round 2, younger child get vaccine, bet signing up. Nobody told us dumped universal healthcare going side too. would find workers? they're quitting burning out. industry already understaffed begin with, especially nurses.  That‚Äôs personal choice. properly vaccinated, personally would worry much unless cases surging area. Maybe I‚Äôd go bar natural distancing like booths opposed bar dance floor reduce chance catching it. 

In terms spreading others, follow whatever guidance state unless visiting someone particularly vulnerable. that‚Äôs case, wait bit something ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù like going bar getting rapid test pharmacy may ease worries. take subway daily plan visiting high risk relatives year. third dose 60 covid worry.  true. typical human behavior. Smokers, motorcyclists won‚Äôt wear helmets, etc. perception life death simply binary understanding likelihood surviving terrible quality life, financial ruin goes good ol‚Äô US A.  promise give fuck. can‚Äôt tell who‚Äôs passionate, folks ones pissed them. guess former, especially look protests around world. Tbf protestors fully vaxxed simply mandates possible future insurers demand employers mandate healthy choices employees. There's already precedence coming tobacco free health insurance plans reward employers reduced costs health insurance rates benefits. Barring extenuating health issues employers stand benefit healthy employees take care bodies. Insurers know people might argue erosion rights counter argument could made poor health choices ultimately lead universal health care socialized medical system forced upon us. I'm sure know meant. hospitals increased patient capacity? guess not. Makes total sense Wash hands ...  right, propaganda, apathy part. dumb selfish party activated Well, long they‚Äôre vaccinated, matter? Seriously‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs easy lot people? Aside health reasons that‚Äôs reason get vaccine. widely available. it‚Äôs certainly anyone‚Äôs job stay home. ample time everyone get vaccinated. suppose do? Hide inside we‚Äôre 100% vax rate? It‚Äôs never gonna happen, covid stay. Take precautions continue living life hard nail I'd say . started hospital year ago , right beginning winter surge , past month half way worse , past weekend absolutely system breaking . 

Few weeks ago seemed like 60/40 mix vaxxed unvaxxed , one's really asking anymore since half ER boarded ( stuck ER ICU , medsurg transfers available). 

I still gotten it, though I'm hermit , linger long public spaces , take mask work unless outside eating . 

I think people thought vaccine end went business usual, complicates data imagine find base line inspecting metrics . like government ‚Äúbracing‚Äù emergency power Short term gain. Maybe gets employee back office, causing undue stress home situation leads resentment. u dont need sell anything, look US CIA website countries level risk travelling covid, china ranked lowest risk, along island countries like NZ small countries high vax rates. good beds staff support them? can't add beds call day ya ever bring medical issues dumb antivaxxer I'm sorry, I'm quite getting point. re-explain? uh yeah immune compromised husband. 2nd uncle survived vaccines virus. unvaxxed cousin survived virus minor symptoms. I‚Äôm getting feeling many vaccine hesitant relying heavily anecdotes rather institutions see reply feel matter, curious - would civic minded do? makes situation ""attention span short""?

I can't restrain people administer vaccine fine wear mask, can't imagine anyone instituting second quarantine, I'd love hear thoughts improve situation instead insulting us done civic duty last 2 years tired sacrificing normality behalf others give shit start. California trainwreck time last year? get measures help honestly surges seem random lot time. I'm like... work getting done? long deadlines met money keeps flowing, know company would change something works makes everyone happier  Covid brain   face also important us every 4 years pay attention.... thats tech called hostile lol. leap frog tech kinda like africa switched landlines cellphones u/DeanAmbrose Yes? protect others. What's problem. Wow, that's hateful message, I'll fix spelling error. Kind dreading going families gathering. Two people know third fan party hates science. Crossing fingers. around time things opening vaccines still needed lot age groups. happened spreading misinformation?  200 million it, 80% vaxxed leaving 40 million risk, 10% population kids. numbers still line small population filling hospitals again. point would run people infect. got today. actually misspelt 'grammar'? Even website, copy paste order make link, spelled correctly. Get reddit start new life someone reads hobby. Stop visiting anything related public health college-educated level. making world worse place right now. happened too. Got first doses March/April. Got booster last week couple 70s walked first dose. can't imagine living like age. two weeks guys! curve flatten time   felt feverish two days stuffy nose/sore throat brain fog insane appetite week.lost taste almost three weeks. bad compared brother experienced I'm still sure mild case covid normal one body able fight it? much know yet. I'm left wondering got smaller viral load wore mask kept distance brother not. Wow, booked booster last night got morning local grocery store. Thank cornerstone member family died Covid absolutely family member changed mind Covid. dug further, convincing hospitals fault. 
Send help. Yes, true, modern businesses 2021 embraced newfangled ""phone"" technology, instead continuing rely tried true carrier pigeons pageboys  Well, difference. starters, nurse trained individual. also people create plans protocols, either doctors advised them. like come stuff saw Facebook post, like many others do, least state bunch health professionals ""advising"" create protocols pandemic (and health-related issues). forgive layman ignorant job, authorities power control things happen, can't. job informed knowledgeable jobs, least rely experts know themselves. shape people's actions besides regulations impose, responsibility, imo. second wave? nahi doubt Well, going #vaccinated percentage, many forced it? many half wits screaming gaucho masks. CDC says quarantine vaccinated showing symptoms. idea choose image article.

This late October, cases Moscow spiked nearly ten thousand day, city went weeklong lockdown, opened back restrictions.Photograph Gavriil Grigorov / Tass / Getty old friends? Masks really bad PR disaster. shouldn‚Äôt said it. time didn‚Äôt know would Americans tendency panic horde needed medical personnel. shouldn‚Äôt said it. Especially us don‚Äôt seem understand science recommendations changing encounter novel disease actually good thing means we‚Äôre learning. Well depressing thread. Ivermectin great parasitic worms. Possibly also mites cause rosacea. going anything covid directly, though one interesting wrinkle IVM+COVID that's surfaced recently.

One things keeping Ivermectin hoopla alive small number apparently competently run studies appear show ivermectin helps reduce COVID mortality. 

But turns conducted areas parasitic worms endemic, studies ivermectin COVID areas worms uncommon show effect.

Turns high doses steroids (commonly used severe covid) also shut part immune system keeps parasitic worms check.  number patients turn worms + covid end dying combination covid + worm hyperinfection.

So lesson is: chance parasitic worms course ivermectin called get steroids. likelihood someone US parasitic worms low ivermectin make difference vast majority cases here.

See, among places, bc Russia o.d.d. means, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve exhausted supply civic duty I‚Äôm going selfish shit now. attention span short care Covid anymore.‚Äù Wait hate people ""From depths soul"", yet chose nurse help people living deeply worried family... Makes perfect sense üëç Goodness. vaccinated boosted. safe. people merely saying done hiding away living life people, that‚Äôs perfectly fine. Covid never going away, it‚Äôs stay. 

This isn‚Äôt propaganda. taken necessary steps go back living normal lives. Enough fear mongering we‚Äôre gonna kill somebody we‚Äôre going meet friends! 

Everyone plenty time take necessary precautions get vaccinated. It‚Äôs us protect every person. someone elderly immunocompromised, it‚Äôs stay protected safe.  It‚Äôs quite simple thing track, most, countries aren‚Äôt providing stats. 

They obfuscate data track stuff like that, otherwise go narrative committed to. 

Singapore tracking stop data wasn‚Äôt aligning. Oh, *shit.* Narrator: problem?  even mean? Sounds familiar‚Ä¶ 

Also, I‚Äôm thinking titled *‚Äùeveryone should‚Ä¶‚Äù* say *‚Äùto include vaccinated‚Äù* I‚Äôm big fry guy, enjoy ice cream really upsets stomach. can‚Äôt go Wendy‚Äôs get fries frosty eat together. Thanks writing out.

No. Obviously enough people vaccinated.  couple people getting first shot went get boosters. nice see new people still signing up. Several others tried walk first shot appointment only. hope get soon Nope, clarifying context comment. say CDC estimates 140 million recovered COVID. clarified CDC makes distinction levels ""recovery"", i.e. define recovered longer detectable levels SARS-CoV-2 testing. CDC, die, recovered. someone fan family get togethers, actually looking forward Thanksgiving year.

Then found two nephews vaccinated multi-day discussion wife called mom Sunday told coming.

We able get booster shots time, vaccinated back April, willing risk it. 

This also means need think rescheduling Christmas.  Sorry hear that. Candy Satellite know she‚Äôs quarantined mother vaccinated? lied said lost vax card. Pretended wanted second dose actually third. Don‚Äôt believe anything anybody says Yes, experience social work well. try stay healthy. say Covid made allergies asthma worst they've ever year. spoke relatives who've said sinuses allergies awful Covid. That's one reason I'm interested vaccine - help that. Technically true not. People adopt other's behaviors continually exposed them. So, people still possess free will, frequently adopt bad eating habits exposed friends family practicing bad habits. besides vaccinating?

I‚Äôm American can‚Äôt say first hand evidence I‚Äôve hearing stories American hospitals gongshows quite long time, well Covid.

From understanding places like Sweden even Florida seem fairly well limited lock protocols place. 

In opinion vaccine Covid part everyday life now, can‚Äôt continue impose totalitarian mandates try prevent spread. pharmaceutical industry main stream media interest bringing scientific discussion topic seem quite content sell vaccines questionable efficiency common public matter point Covid supposed disappear. 

So said original comment, 2 weeks flatten curve! sure it‚Äôs 52nd 520th 2 week period going finally get job done diseases prevented single injection, sure. Whelp, DNR get there.

Yeah... majority corporations benefit COVID. near collapse. collapsed. hospital currently collapsed, functioning drastically lower volumes huge delays surgery, testing, etc. endgame enough people strong T-cell immunity virus. matter much anyone gets infected strong immunity severe disease wind hospital.

If 100% people got vaccinated we'd done pandemic phase.

We're stuck burning unvaccinated people, sufficient amounts going hospitals morgues, dry fuel consumed vaccine fire. start going hospital fast start getting knocked treating COVID resource intensive weeks hospital.

Until that's done can't let virus rip vaccinated part population transmit unvaccinated people ones hospitals.

Unfortunately due delta due pockets clusters unvaccinated, looks like herd immunity number effectively 100% (and kids count).

And also unfortunately, people listen somewhat socially responsible vaccinated, they're ones likely adopt maintain guidelines slow spread virus done.

Sigh. Protecting unvaccinated reason wearing mask. see, vaccine perfect either. near-perfectly prevents winding ICU. comes things, vaccine (at least current vaccines, maybe next generation better) so-so. prevent getting COVID-19 (a form require ICU treatment), prevent spreading SARS-CoV-2.

One big mistakes recent times pandemic configuration ""team vaccinated"" feel free drop measures, duty mock ""team unvaccinated"".

News headline: Anti covid vaxxer gets covid. aspect story hypocrisy. reason reported shared people love enjoy hypocrisy others. I‚Äôm really sorry, that‚Äôs awfully terrible thing deal with. believe it‚Äôs important understand point return already passed COVID-19, around humans long time, way longer lifetime. Take it‚Äôs unfortunate truth. you‚Äôre sick enough Delta need ventilation, doesn‚Äôt matter much resources available ‚Äî odds making back among living poor. odds living without significant disability effectively nil. It‚Äôs important unvaccinated public understands present moment, hospitals don‚Äôt much offer you‚Äôre really sick Covid. (Approval Pfizer‚Äôs new med could game changer, though.) keep hearing work: ""I'll fine. I'm young healthy. never get sick. need vaccine."" No, it‚Äôs hypochondriac like. It‚Äôs realizing situation ground wanting end thing. 

If vaccinated booster good, excellent fact, current vaccines effective original were. provide effective sterilizing immunity delta. immediate risk low, still transmit others vaccinated. people gotten vaccine thus may feel deserve get, two important factors here. 

1) become burden population general continuing transmission load hospitals (which immediately affect suddenly need medical care). 

2) would argue right vulnerable situation virus. roughly half population vaccinated. half potential hosts resistant, ample selective pressure viral mutation escape. Also half population vaccinated, still ample hosts mutations occur in. need responsible ones everything possible keep case count lower odds mutation selective pressure act enough population immunized prevent likelihood mutation. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

When you‚Äôre physician, buck stops you. 

If surgeon told ‚Äúyou‚Äôll totally kite surf problem‚Äù couldn‚Äôt, wouldn‚Äôt sued physical therapist. would sued surgeon. 

The essential difference midlevels physicians physicians hold ultimate liability, ultimate fear fucking killing seriously injuring someone. 

You want put terms $$s? Malpractice insurance midlevels often 1/10th price physician. means PT paying $800/yr, orthopedic surgeon paying $8k (actually probably much more). 

This isn‚Äôt defense noble physician denouncement midlevels. really need physicians *and* midlevels. it‚Äôs something think whenever hear ‚Äúmy doctor told I‚Äôd never X again, showed him/her‚Äù stories. chance someone would unvaccinated get Covid.

Probably worth clarifying ""get covid"" mean ""infected covid""? (as far know, likely fully vaccinated people infected; correct I'm wrong, please!) 

Rather ""get covid"" means ""infected covid severe symptoms consequences"". 

(assuming that's meant) wrong, lot unavoidable. science conditions ground developed forced messaging change.

E.g. said masks/cloth masks, preserve PPE hospitals. got supply issues, made sense ditch cloth masks tell people use proper protection.

I think booster mixed messaging reflection science coming in. discovering folks still protected, pretty dramatic increase third shot, line difference unvaxxed vaxxed phizer least. mutated virus even contagious lethality.   Lots people vaccinated lots natural infections occurring - point virus start slowing down

Hopefully so, worry immunity still patchy virus easily keep going.

The situation might even get worse ‚Äî right lot people vaccinated ""same wave"", future people get boosters different timeframes people might get sloppy them. immunity naturally acquired infections also start means last proper surge.

That said every surge.

I would wait see first. Maybe calmly observe 6 months, big wave 6 months, could note progress made.

I surprised winter's waves start go people start celebrating ""the vaccines finally starting show full effect"", everyone would celebrating early, spring would give new wave. got booster today.

So found individual solution collective problem.

Literally *nothing* else do! think obligation protect others, others protect themselves, too.

Once people chosen take least onerous steps look interests, moral obligation reduced. someone use free bus pass, pay cab ride.   lot people education bracing it. Schools universities always Petri dishes germs. Covid makes anxiety provoking, exhausted arguing, changing policy, anger sides, stress possible exposure. Christmas break may suck.

Even mild long term side effects would devastating me. I‚Äôm loss words point people view whole situation. Masks end pandemic though. flatten curve. Immunity ends pandemic. kid (above 5) whose parents wanted vaccinate could done (first dose least). widespread vaccine availability, walk get it. Thank answers, may ask another?
 
If exposed covid-19 vaccinated keep testing negative selftests official ones (idk much difference is), even infected? thought infection required antibodies (which would detected tests) even vaccinated.
 quite. mRNA vaccines amazing, probably better old kinds, still figuring space doses like vaccines. 
 
Oh... measles require booster shot fast these, they? Measles vaccines apparently 93% effectiveness too, covid vaccines less. 
 call ""breakthrough"" infection flu vaccine. measles. get exposed measles vaccinated, may get asymptomatic infection could detected increased antibodies.
 
So ""breakthrough"" really thing, mostly fashion word? Don‚Äôt. Please. people thought let‚Äôs take booster pandemic over. I‚Äôm üíØ% ok this. Wait, kill father prove point?

Why allowed take care father delusional? turns he‚Äôs scum Earth excuse still need vaccine precaution moment. Sorry bring bad news Delta b*tch. Turning news going save reality. many advantages capital current arrangement, they're impossible even enumerate readily.

The entire edifice extractive, exploitive, elaborately crafted layman, Dickensian, Kafkaesque. Orwellian, even, one contemplates manipulative, deceptive doublespeak marketing language associated it.

Argh. low information public, get booster really need another 3 months antibody levels high. Obviously written Showtime writers. never know call ‚Äúcurtains‚Äù. got one year old tested he‚Äôs one family vaccinated we‚Äôre seeing elderly family members There's something broken ~~public health~~ establishment US.

FTFY.

Hint: bought &amp; paid lock, stock, barrel rich, thus works rich. guess we'll see lot variants produced countries virus running unchecked due unaffordable unavailable vaccination. newborns start getting vaccinated, life return normal. then, need protecting can't get vaccinated. 

But continue ass ""live life"". Summary: current vaccines much keep people infected, inference, transmitting virus others. 

This one paragraph, open access letter Lancet journal. summarizes recent results five academic reports one two sentences each. example: 

Between August 21 October 27 Germany, vaccination rate increased 67% 84%. period proportion Covid cases *fully vaccinated* people (over 60 years old) increased 17% total 59%. Thus vaccines keep people hospital, vaccination mean less transmission.

The author cites reports UK, US, Israel. Grim news interpret correctly. went get flu shot decent amount getting vaccine booster shot High numbers mutations necessarily mean lethal anything like that. mutations. could evolutionary dead end could become lethal. something else between. Yes, vaccinate babies, level measles, mumps, rest diseases inoculate new people with. Chile, 40 million vaccines available 19 million people, without considering 90% population fully vaxxed 50 booster. 

Still people wearing masks outside, keep closing spaces tired shit. New York last week, Covid vacation me. shocked see people walking outside without masks, even considering ive read many articles saying masks outside useful.  chuckled little hard one. boosters yes, things safer. many yet (in US, presumably are, rest world). necessarily ""caring."" Chances ending long covid cut half two vaxxes. 91% death rate? cant right, low, since 98% average big toe also hurts ran lot pandemic. Pretty sure it‚Äôs ‚Äúturf toe‚Äù. nothing infection. still mask indoors. trapped.  

I'm sorry people suck. time go restaurants unpopular times (besides, defeat purpose everyone this?)

Oh, right, like everyone's going that. like everyone's going take vaccine wear mask.

But, you, personally live busy life 7 days week can't go restaurant unpopular time. sounds like full life know complaining about. time go restaurants avoid things want putting life hold.

No, not. called mature adult compensate.

As said another experience solid natural disaster...like way hurricanes here...to get perspective.

Then discover really like put life hold.

As also said attitude ""If can't things used way used life hold."" know sounds attitude ""I'm going things safe way enjoy them.""

Reeking self-pity attractive quality. day one ""back normal fast possible"" ""what needs done beat long happens."" 

For almost everybody know weeks, months, Christmas, next summer, complaining whole time unjust miss melted (emotionally procedurally) whatever date hand came went.

I one I'm close said (January 2020) ""until goes way, almost certainly 18-24 months, probably everyone (all-ages) chance vaccinate, possibly longer mutates and/or escapes vaccination""--to expect pushback vaccination, they'd wane quickly are, near-instantaneous abandonment non-enforcement mitigations second vaccine became possible.

The disaster, human, natural, combination, takes long takes--not long person wants thinks put it.

Increasingly, seems people capable dealing disasters last days (tornado, flood, hurricane, terror attack) month fallout--maybe longer effected victims; catastrophic issues may continue years.

To like closing shops schools break war home soil (something almost living Americans Europeans point) deal with; two months later deciding bombs raining sky ""something live with"" rather ""the changes continue war least situation, over."" Maybe they're thinking children right children need locked entire childhood?  [The US already donated 200 million doses across makes perfect sense context seeing covid serious threat, dominant expert perspective time. can't say chief executive time hid views that. know dumb ones really loud  get vaccinated nuts.  Thats scared covid US. right sick worker.

You odd sick days limited. cant stay home, risk losing money. initially said masks work expecting healthy, vaccinated people wear masks forever. Good luck getting people follow that!

I like you. lol Thanks chuckle. hope got rest.  quite late said year, also 100% without Delta either  Got booster shot last night. Let‚Äôs see feel today aint bracing shit. Yes will.

Sind regions give light lockdown vaccinated stricter one unvaccinated. doubt enough.

We see one two weeks works. 

The infections doubles every two weeks.

Make math  think I've heard truer comment this. concerned, already took appropriate steps. not, didn't. Well said!  Everything open. still us continue avoid public spaces continue wearing masks. opinion level caution necessary. 

For us taking seriously, still restrictive, albeit self-imposed. could avoided, hence feel bad people brain yet need socialization. Last numbers seen 40-50% vaccinated.

Means vaccination rate 85-90% age group ICU vaccine effective. 

All vaccinated people ICU either really old issues immune system. Im weird guy like wearing mask   regions 4% children infected right  100%

How people coming city get vaccinated 

Oh ok then. parents vaxxed boosted, resistant demographic. real side effects mention. know much hospitals US, pay way (not like Canada european countries). goes:
Who pays medical treatment get Covid? goverment etc. pay got chance getting vaccinated declined? know pay anyone circumstance (like call, deal it).
So economical reasons get vaccinatet either?  Thanks, way see south eastern parts.

Pretty sure this. I'm tired, boss.  RKI said CFR 0.8%

So 74000 people 550 die. doomed, know it. thinking same. People going point. wild Everything open, people talking about?

I full arena last week hockey game concert week before. I've gone dine four times span well.

Seriously, wtf talking about? multiply 0.8% get casualties day 3 weeks. see 500 deaths day December.  possible take earlier medical reasons.   end? never ending story.

I'll keep part stay safe beyond point. miss normal life.  Aaron said nothing covid toe

He Biden still declared victory summer dropped mask recommendation. Yes, supposed vaccinated, come on, really believe going happen.


So issue made recommendation known anti-vaxxers follow... recommendation could possibly make anti-vaxxers would follow? Seems like damned damned it?   Yeah. Mask etc. responsible things   Exactly thoughts fourth wave Europe seems nowhere me, NL new daily infection also going parabolic.

Anyway, always date news. particular explanation (likely) explains increase?

Is maybe result opening time creating many ""spreading"" events? like new covid virus variant also ""immune"" already introduced vaccine? keep calling waves? Whatever stance Covid vaccines, never going rid covid. Vaccinated not. Covid going stay rest lifetimes.

It‚Äôs it‚Äôs 5th wave‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs going Covid season. Covid becoming endemic. eventually infect EVERYONE. Vaccines help you, others. still get virus spread others. disease CANNOT vaccinate way of. fourth wave seems nowhere me, NL new daily infection also going parabolic. 

Anyway, always date news.
Is particular explanation (likely) explains increase?

Is maybe result opening time creating many ""spreading"" events? like new covid virus variant also ""immune"" already introduced vaccine? Probably 5-10 years shorter might expected. 

For many, even lifespan reduced, quality life dramatically. Months painful therapy rehab. day day living permanent tiredness, shortness breath, slightest cold make feel like dying, actual flu infection could kill, progressing pneumonia.

I think left anything ... still vaccinated, many governments outreach (in USA, federal government cannot mandate vaccinations everybody, mandate employees, that's Let‚Äôs say movie theatre, everyone vaccinated except couple people one row, that‚Äôs bad, right? 

Probably ... see argument \*against\* mandating moviegoers vaccinated ... depends. 

First, percentage unvaccinated people would movie mandate? Without mandate? difference significant? assuming difference much, true? 

The thing side-effects; mandating vaccines moviegoers would, say, make 10% teenagers vaccinated, might worth :)

I'm assuming exceptions, vast majority governments want minimum mandates; lot work everybody. obvious vaccines work. Ideally get 95% population vaccinated (and boosting every years, needed) \*without\* mandates, that's happening?

I'm approaching mostly utilitarian perspective (anti-vaxers may a-holes, matter; want hurt because). get enough people vaccinated, mandates make sense \*one\* way increase rate. different mandates, different effectiveness (which change due local conditions), many interventions (PR campaigns, drawings, different ways get vaccines people), governments probably need choose those. many tradeoffs, I'd rather mayor today :) (or ever, right ... :) Yup, that‚Äôs keep saying PCR testing useful you‚Äôre actually sick. could exposed, immune system job without ever knowing it. would cause positive PCR test RNA that‚Äôs molecular shredder.

Spread across hallway hotel arrivals. ever comes FDA needing save us, we're fucked. people going maskless vaccinated.  They‚Äôve said would counterintuitive that. vaccines still work delta - changing everything isn‚Äôt quite worth much would slow vaccine production.

They said doesn‚Äôt work get new vaccine couple months. Don‚Äôt forget good ol‚Äô Rupert. I'm seeing reputable people say still issue spite error Can't see doctor figure Canada? Broken ribs certainly cause damage organs, lung damage leading infection catastrophic unless easily treated early on. course basic things life needed. even wear coat cold 10 years needed.

If CD8 ""helper T"" cell encounters antigen it'll release hormones triggering rest immune system scale up. helper cells bloodstream, random virion lands lungs never infects anything unlikely trigger even one them. infection starts immune system notices quickly enough fight incubation period certainly get immune boost. media ""the variant turning vaccines useless"" Bs.

Sooo means every month whole family gets covid test every single time, negative. 

People still get regular colds. get tested case. Apparently lifting patents really issue agree sentiments would spread faster. Total active cases associated proportion requiring hospitalisation would overflow icus.. doesn‚Äôt matter control not, think screwed normal life. Still 2 cases HK big news go again.  Ok Santa Little Saint James?  Delta variant extremely infectious. What, reading past months, would give idea wasn't? think quite extreme - according Alpha 9 spike mutations, Beta 8, Gamma 12 Delta 9 (at least original forms). Still concerning course. point mandate likely effective ones currently place. It‚Äôs relaxed mandates driving spread. Seems like lot needs done protect healthcare system, though idea what. rapid testing / contact tracing? It‚Äôs definitely large majority aren‚Äôt willing anymore.  paper might seem like good idea, vaccinated people always mingle unvaccinated friends, family least colleagues. Also enough vaccinated people catch virus time, cause problem health care systems too. 

A general, strict lockdown, combined strategy immunize many possible shortest possible time, way go imo.  vaccine best one people get today, numbers rising. shocking j&amp;j widely distributed poor, rural, marginalized areas, given lack refrigeration needed etc, slowing spread surge important   don‚Äôt wear mask? don‚Äôt. people don‚Äôt. really. customer refuses told argues loudly belligerently attendant deserves consequences even touch attendant. actions also putting health safety passengers risk, doubly so. specifically laws saying going enforce legal repercussions obvious people abusing leniency.  way see slowing down, places this... 

Every country countries shut everything except businesses essential living 4 months more, mean real shut down, one like 2020 half a**. 

No one allowed park beaches, camping, traveling, jogging outside ect, go going buy food water tissue, buy medicine, moving new house apartment, going work, going medical care, grocery stores limit amount people inside bassed space stores. 
No walking outside without mask, that's several thousand dollar fine jail, enforced. 
If contact someone caught covid, 21 day quarantine, still come positive 14 days. 

The Government something give funds businesses (even mom &amp; pop ones) cover employees wages well kind profits usually would make, stipulation must fire employees durring time, give regular salary, whether show work (cause lot places closed). businesses this, money taken away required pay government back already spent, employees said company compensated full salary government immediately full regular basis.

For people work business still open, employees required tested regularly free matter what, even vaxinated, come positive must contact trace well let employees recover, stated earlier must get payed regular salary even work till get better. Companies breaking rule punished. know companies like usps shipping companies making sick employees work even covid semptoms, can't none that.

As people staying homes, able get free home covid tests stipulations get test many get. Also make illegal sell tests, free all. 

This way see getting better anytime within next 5 years, otherwise going become endemic anytime soon, stay pandemic death toll gets worse year.

May ask wuhan measures wouldn‚Äôt contain that? Didnt isolate entire region? could new variant spread conditions? mention people avoiding testes can't afford take 2 weeks work.  Regardless children‚Äôs vaccination status, places haven‚Äôt seen kind infectious rate throughout entire pandemic, 90% adult populations, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd seeing less less cases, increase? research would like. let know. Wow, idea surprised someone gets fights Flights likely someone repeatedly gets fights. 

People repeatedly get trouble law generally much money. 

Domestic flights low-cost regional carriers often round-trip tickets cost less $100. need remotely rich afford fly one airlines (Which lot fights happening).  Learn navigate life this? let 9/11 happen every two days like it‚Äôs big deal? Literally nobody authority knowledge, many general public definitely declared grew impatient. can't believe already happening they've giving fines Well might governments around world learned mistakes made original strain, alpha delta shut travel South Africa.

So course, we're fucked (again) we? Oh, no, I'm saying Biden avoid using executive powers can. Love quickly gave naming variants places‚Ä¶

Alpha, Beta, Delta‚Ä¶ ahh, fuck - call one South Africa.    like assume lottery $1 $1M, gets increasingly less probable win higher amount. represents spectrum wimpiest vs worst case disease variant. Delta is, sake argument, $900k prize, beta $400k prize. likely would end something worse beta max prize ""won"" thus far, less likely end something worse delta.

Unfortunately, play win. That's true, Austria lock-down unvaccinated that's concern 10% population vaccinated?

As breakthrough cases, rate hospitalizations low (from understanding) concern.   Okay lmao, take little anecdotes I‚Äôll wait see happens pls give link, interesting sounds like exactly sort research could accidentally start new pandemic. Also, COVID running millions experiments parallel every day evolves -- would likely really hard compete COVID ability come novel mutations. Unfortunately number comparing November 24 November 18, number unaffected backlog read article even ""real"" quarantaine breach, transmission hallway, it?

This stuff definitely seems bad. Indeed.  read computer model new strain predicted could avoid immune response, especially T-Cells. Chartering plane unaffordable people.

For me, ways would like power company refusing business someone like. Imagine private company turning electricity without giving chance make case somewhere.

I think another problem fly lists unchecked bans like, middle manager homeland security would say - ""Michael Smith"" sus, therefore, we'll ban flying. ""Michael Smith's"" suddenly recourse want get plane. could even case original Michael Smith completely innocent well to, maybe visited mosque one day.

I've actually seen something like talking about. exist. positive rate 35% Saxony. Hospitals health departments work capacity here. matter time spike mortality rates cases still growing faster faster. Worst all, people give fuck.  [The ACLU Fly list due people's inability fight due That‚Äôs terrible methodology; people household much closely related average social contacts, thus much likely share genetic, epigenetic, environmental factors would slow stop immune response vaccine. tests, mean different things:

Rapid Antigen Negative: probably spreading virus right now.

Rapid Antigen Positive: probably spreading virus right now.

PCR Negative: probably infected while.

PCR Positive: probably infected recovering infection last month thought infection required antibodies (which would detected tests) even vaccinated.

Antibody tests require blood draw, look antibodies blood. ""Antigen"" fancy word viral proteins, found mucus nasal/saliva test, get feeling might confusing ""Antigen"" ""Antibody"", maybe that's I'm reading question. PCR looks parts viral RNA nose/saliva measles require booster shot fast these, they? Measles vaccines apparently 93% effectiveness too, covid vaccines less.

The reason gave second shot 3-4 weeks mRNA vaccine we're pandemic needed good protection NOW, three years. With[ get shot year old booster years later (unless there's ton measles going around community doctor says second dose sooner). get third shot, worries, cause problem. (iirc MMR special three vaccines combined help work better lower doses compared separated, complicated)

So needed strong immunity really quickly, gave second doses really quickly, turns that's probably good time wait years (which don't). get another dose years, may long lasting high efficacy like measles vaccine. 


Some people think ""breakthrough"" word using, yes. True. get sick without vaccinated, fuck 'em! better occupy hospital bed ignorance. Let ""natural"" immunity thing privacy home. come crying medicine help deny vaccine. one going this. I‚Äôm sorry recommending fully vaccinated individuals? shall leave Zumunda Covid ravages it, Simi...I need save royal.oats! Weird, heard lot nasty long term respiratory problems smoking. ""whole"" ""a number piece paper last census"", ""the actual population city"". certainly 100% integer. No, he‚Äôs trying hide it. example, passage hot Germany, rate symptomatic COVID-19 cases among fully vaccinated (‚Äúbreakthrough infections‚Äù) reported weekly since 21. July 2021 16.9% time among patients 60 years older [2]. proportion increasing week week 58.9% 27. October 2021 (Figure 1) providing clear evidence increasing relevance fully vaccinated possible source transmission.

Where case rate per 100k vaccinated vs unvaccinated points time? Germany 85% vaccinated age group; rate July?

For matter, even absolute counts? 16900 infections 100000 much significant 598 infections 1000.

These basic statistical questions ask author pointedly presented obscure irrelevant data rather honest. I‚Äôm curious, aside getting vaccinated (I hope are) wearing mask, mitigations taken improve health? 
And ‚Äúpiece cloth‚Äù argument reductive. work children day course wear one. communication social connections impeded. truly heartbreaking.
You made many erroneous assumptions me. turn, I‚Äôm simply going wish good day. order spike protein change. double edged sword virus since specific shape spike protein allows gain access cells first place. 

I think likely virus evolves mechanism makes effective efficient replicating.

Look like jackpot. Covid already big delta. order Covid win jackpot win even bigger delta. Anything less relatively inconsequential. likelihood would happen made difficult virus orders magnitude. Probably best asks doctor know. 

But instinct tells still ok. 3/4 week gap strict schedule extended like UK example initially 12 week gap 1st/2nd doses around 3 months. Canada one point also like 14 week gap. countries worked fine. evidence even suggests may beneficial leave larger Canada/UK think shortened gap that's Delta want people fully vaccinated asap.

But speak doctor double check I'm sure it'll fine. Bring agree, point there's less class divide accessibility flights people think. dumb jerk!  Sounds like it‚Äôs working pretty well. number breakthrough cases different decreasing transmission, cases represent individual failures break link chain transmission*. think it‚Äôs important note many breakthrough cases serious fatal illnesses‚Äî number quite low. Also, 40% might sound like failure, consider translates 60% cases coming roughly 20% people unvaccinated, sounds lot better.

Setting goal posts vaccine completely eliminating transmission serious illness entirely misses point. It‚Äôs like saying there‚Äôs reason avoid smoking, still get lung cancer without smoking. preventative action doesn‚Äôt entirely eliminate risk, greatly decreases it, comparatively downsides. reasoning, makes worthwhile.

Not mention make flying safer. vaccines work part virus enters cells infects. mutation necessarily mean virus changed evade vaccines. 

For instance, case delta mutation cleavage site helps virus successfully infect cell. case delta virus probably isn‚Äôt evading vaccine much better successfully infecting cells person‚Äôs immune response catch up, like well equipped force repelling invasion overwhelming force, body expected fight better prepared (vaccinated/natural immunity), losses small victories, take time expel invasion antibody production ramps fend virus.

Keep mind mutation directly effects spike protein chance effectively hamstring virus current virus depends effectively enter cells. fact type mutation likely already occurred, you‚Äôre unaware effectively weren‚Äôt able replicate (this way novel mutations work, they‚Äôre mostly deleterious, think cancer).

I think currently less likely we‚Äôll get something transmissible delta, quintupled sextupled transmissibility. could evolve deadly that‚Äôs double edged sword quickly victims killed less likely transmit. Eh, denser connected populations, feel like effects efforts flatten curve slow spread outweighs that, artificially 'prolonging' pandemic. necessarily bad thing there's way less deaths, take longer virus run course humanity longer resume normalcy. sounds like read article looked chart without taking context article itself.

Grumbling entire time. also said ""barely flu last year, year it'll probably same"", ""it's probably going become totally unnecessary get vaccinated flu strains"". surprised, know better?! need rude. get flight $100.

For one thing, change evade vaccinations may neuter ways.

Beyond typical path virus eventually get less deadly better survival. may may happen here, happened many viruses past.

Then ""it killed everyone could"" factor. point, torn everyone kill. still reinfect folks, still kill people get big viral load, develop conditions put risk, on. part population genetically predisposed really bad bout it, point infected killed vulnerable. ultimately means downward trajectory.

Finally remember starkly different vaccination rates different places, creating different evolutionary pressures. live, 97 percent people eligible got shots. number went bit expansion younger folks quickly climb back effective local herd immunity. evolutionary pressures live escape vaccination, actually may make less deadly efficient give vaccinated folks mild asymptomatic cases give ton symptoms causing quarantine (again 97 percent got shots, people unlikely infect others knowingly).

Compare evolutionary pressures place 50 percent penetration vaccination. creates different pressures, necessarily towards escaping vaccine.   good. Lockdowns solve little, especially immunity getting weaker time. Either vaccination mandatory (which Austria plans tbh). accept time everyone receive great care, grateful due success uptake vaccines, emergency several times less awful would last winter. lockdowns solution point.

Conflating country current government country exactly authoritarian government wants (think terms ‚Äòanti-British‚Äô ‚Äòanti-American‚Äô (miss) used recent years).

By taking stance, play Kremlin‚Äôs hands. It‚Äôs want do. Made one March friend‚Äôs record store. really work! I'm called free state working construction safety projects. Concerned. much kids school even require masking. cases made aware since school started back up. That‚Äôs great hear thanks crazy, right? know anecdotal, every body different got kind really horrible flu March 2020 (which might actually covid), worst shit I've ever had. Worse swine flu back '09.

I fever week, loss taste smell couple months, body aches weeks, shortness breath, coughing little hard phlegm pellets, really nasty migraines, etc. shit brutal!

My reaction Moderna shot definitely noticeable, nothing compared virus.

I'm saying everyone mild reactions vaccine. maybe dad really bad reaction. like imply, there's definitely tendency people exaggerate vaccine reaction jeopardize pandemic opinions. keep seeing sentiment sure think. 

What ""done"" mean? sucks, one likes current state affairs, yet.

Because virus ain't done. Man would think point everyone exposed vaccinated. work florist, Yeah, personally want make like super aggressive stand this, I'm disappointed healthcare workers vaccinated really scared say patients. COVID Battle pass when?

At jab unlock legendary skins?

Yeah, sorry, nobody bracing anything Last week toddler fingers shut hinge door. Awful bruising swelling screaming course. doctor said seen urgent care office, bleeding we're OK wait day. course available urgent care ER time slots rest day anywhere around here.

So that's are. hurt doctor, hurt enough emergency care. scares me. Good luck. COVID last November, horrible 2 weeks. 

Drink lots water get pulse ox monitor. Nah, Pfizer's trial estimated 40% children infected pre-delta. makes sense pretty much children live adults. surprised 50-60% kids school months.

Same vaccination I'd imagine: document showing positive test clinical diagnosis. EU recognizing since covid pass started, doable. Sorry Nope. care anymore. reason too. 99.7 got booster (Moderna) flu time also, yup, next day rough! totally worth it. Ohh thank kind stranger, made mine! I'm bracing day longer hear news covid jerk. let foreigners decide come in.

So worries matter  Anti-vaxxers getting hammered is. new variant utterly destroy them. coffee shop yesterday thinking could work couple hours... everyone around coughing bother wear facemask.. moved upstairs, people next still coughing ... left sit outside Good answer. feels like Neon Genesis Evangelion.

A new angel arrived totally unlike old angels..... Took one many sacks  already detected three countries... got letter medical insurance company, saying covid-related treatments covered unless vaccinated, must proof vaccination seeking medical treatment ....  

For lot us, would non-event. 

For others, might convince get vaccinated. 

I expect others reactions, might unpleasant. forget also caused giant rush boosters last month year. got mine bit week ago, want booster area going struggle: everything booked already.

Everyone trying get booster single month, instead 3 4 months could approved adults September. US braces fifth wave coronavirus. Braces everything normal go work slaves.

I went well regarded recommended urgent care week ago. Simply get referral minor ear problem.

4 hour wait..2 waiting room, 2 exam room,,with appointment.

I told leaving.

A frazzled nurse practitoner heard quickly examined ear agreed referral

And gave prescriptions

One good idea. Second longer recommended relevant doctors organization

The third completely wrong asthma inhaler. asthma chest congestion use stethoscope listen lungs etc

No referral made.I go back stand made referral.

I chalk lack nurses gone travel nursing covid big dollars. (And would too). tired pandemic relaxing while.

Based this, hiring ads local hospitals..

I got first ever flu shot. get pnuemonia shot makes sense hep shots.

Anything prevent hospital visit Wrong, ACA set meet minimum insurance standard You‚Äôre going avoid gatherings crowds rest life? one avoided general, cool. one enjoys them‚Ä¶ yea‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sweating em.  It‚Äôs closer 2/3 half okay pessimist. Imagine situation would without vaccines fifth wave expected bad waves occurred anyone vaccinated? I'm looking forward silence follow ""iGotSMuHnAturaLiMmuNiTty"" crowd realizes variant give two shits natural immunity. people bear responsibility government? randomly appear one day. chicken pox 17, bedridden almost two weeks.

I'm normally healthy, fucking sucked. Seeing numbers climbing area. Seem gonna worse late summer surge. Get booster folks! sure. never gave fucks getting vaxxed flu. work offered free, work. 34 years, never thought *moderately* concerned covid. point blame people vote nothing stop government. ‚ÄúAs frustrating is, respect FDA ensuring continue quality tests.‚Äù

Except, costing much unaffordable means ""we"" ""have quality tests."" tests all.

Meanwhile, European comparison meaningless man? think Germans ""poor quality tests""? American him. like Canadians ""wait forever see doctor socialized medicine""?  Hospital workers numb point we‚Äôre trying get day without breaking. far bracing surge it‚Äôs never really stopped Covid numbers go people put elective surgeries filling holes. hospital full plateau delta surge people ailments. Specifically don‚Äôt know talked ICU worked today 50% patients dealing alcohol related illnesses complications alcohol withdraw. two coworkers pulled magnet tried stick arm another coworker got vaccinated back April.

Kind waste master's degrees, tbh.  that's banned mostly everywhere. Well hope working i've heard theories must gummint conspiracy *simply free.*

My dad passed away little month ago pulmonary embolism. secondary cause death certificate Covid-19, tertiary COPD. life infinitely better, I'm attention whore.

And arguments tired, stupid ass arguments debunked March 2020, world. things suggested personal risk. everyone okay killing friends family via stupidity vain basic shit like going clubs pandemic. also ignores long term effects infected, long term effects economy, supply chain things due many lives lost, direct impact supply chains level care everything else people sick constantly. selfish, foolish, short sighted wrong. 

The mental health crisis bad people fragile exist without 1000 crutches helping life. crutches anything important find people give shit.

When stupidity 100% selfish maliciousness. CDC makes distinction survive long-term effects survive ruined lungs, damaged kidneys, long-term cognitive damage, etc. would thought forcing nurses work third party company, instead hospital (partially help avoid liability unionization) would backfire like this.

Hashtag front line heros etc etc. know almost two years past already. immunocompromised family member Thanksgiving. vacation Dec guess actually start earlier, haha. exactly it, especially depending live. People keep asking get back normal, many places normal long time now. South Florida even look like issue. 70ish% vaccinated, high number people level protection due prior infection. Maybe 10%-20% people wearing masks, everything fully open well year. point people moving lives. Especially vaccinated never cared first place. caused least part brutal conditions created unvaccinated get mindset. doctor? think government agencies like CDC whatnot beyond reproach influenced political considerations? think control doctors get opinions? went med school know stuff. don't. Find doctor trust take advice go around knocking doctor's opinions likely better informed yours. Honestly hoping antibodies. means body needs do. 

I've Guillain-Barre that's I'm hesitant shot. postponed thanksgiving aunt came contact sick telling children ""clean plate starving children"" random country. children getting vaccinated help poorer countries get vaccinated faster. vaccines children right now, get them. stop richer countries donating large amounts vaccines poorer countries. cases higher high vaccine rates? Well, patients work health insurance companies certainly protected. passed act lowering age medicare one year year, people 53 years age older would covered, another decade, would effortless include entire population. health insurance companies could still perform deceptive bullshit using Medicare Part C. Everyone would won. I'm also opinion one early treating like it'll become world threat. really interesting genetic profile we've seen far though. 

It's one watch. early freak about, really like something we've seen far pandemic... add list, keeping one. work estate planning get vaccinated immediately infection. Get professional advice that. get vaccinated, excellent immunity. Everyone twists truth darned good reason. trying ""persuade"" resolute fanatics good enough you, it, meet standard, rationales go. 

Did think ""masks work covid"" story justified, well? know people still do, even catasrophic aftermath patent deception--just patent ""the vaccines still effective \[just nearly effective long telling people two months ago really need booster, chance getting transmissible infection going go tenfold, like head Pfizer said back May\]."" might best faucci replaced someone advise think deserve voted. 

I think get point trying make. 

However, think also considered less obvious effects, things death, children get COVID. 

Everything ever learned read COVID vaccines leads conclusion much safer get vaccine get covid. 

IF....and mean...IF....someone's circumstances made unlikely get COVID see receptive someone's argument NEED vaccine.  Maybe someone circumstances ability isolate limit contact people degree unlikely threat others comes COVID. 

However, simple thing often overlooked:

If someone getting vaccine worried effects vaccine...their worry misplaced. effects actually getting covid going much worse.  

In words, two safe logical choices people right concerned health safety pandemic. 

Option 1:
Get vaccinated stay boosted. 

Option 2:
Have enough control activities circumstances life extent reliably get COVID spread people.  would likely also need apply anyone live live others. 

Going something option one option two...you cannot make much claim making safest choice, numbers overwhelmingly you. 5th wave‚Ä¶10th‚Ä¶ else. Get vaccinated don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs life funeral. way, Texas educator here. add beds since started? like ""eh fine next year"" virus gonna virus I‚Äôm done seeing family friends too. alone. I'm even immunocompromised live myself, I've seen 1st hand long term debilitating illnesses do, would never wish anyone.

 disheartening see many people get vaccinated able continue thier empathy keep protective measures. Seems like people missed memo vaccines work enough people get even close, means need keep measures. Yes, sucks many people can't even give enough shit get vaccinated, mean everyone gets care less too, care more. Yes hard, yes unfair, moral thing do. society cesspool. think need read even search chronic Lyme disease google, term ‚Äúchronic Lyme disease‚Äù actually used describe long term effects Borrelia bacterium. clearly states term, ‚Äúchronic Lyme disease‚Äù misnomer used prescribers prescribe long term antibiotics different actual Lyme disease. people may long term symptoms 6 months, antibiotic treatment isn‚Äôt suppose used long. misdiagnosis diseases actually Lyme disease, put ‚Äúchronic Lyme disease‚Äù quotations.

No, universal healthcare, kind big package bills impactful decades improve patient care. doubt could pass anything similar current political environment.  whatever motivates them. matter reason.

[Here, cheer Brace what? home us vaccinated got covid vaccine friends. fearmongering. I'm done covid. Funny, got booster morning reward drove straight Wendy‚Äôs breakfast combo. breakfast potatoes *chef‚Äôs kiss* I‚Äôm still working physically active though (I power lifter).

I need look physical health. Trying convince mum real reality people, even vaccination, statistically nothing worry covid. always unlucky outliers got sick died, younger, healthy, not-obese people always going fine. I‚Äôm saying people done nothing, numbers don‚Äôt lie. 

For younger people, isolation, loss work ability live mental health crisis we‚Äôve much, much worse actual disease. still is. 

Then vaccines came, almost everyone got became well protected. old sick still vulnerable, vast majority population not.

It‚Äôs moral failing, it‚Äôs stupidity, it‚Äôs acknowledgement life always risk avoiding life 2 years isn‚Äôt making hardly anyone‚Äôs life better. Covid took step father past march. Neither mom caught brother sister catch it. headache 2 days felt fine otherwise, bed ridden week.

One guys work hospitalized 3 weeks covid first hit survived. dont know anyone else hospitalized circle. Obviously vacc work. No. 

I balance. best protect others, still looking mental health. 

Life short got make best now. enjoy (fully vaxxed booster), see vaccinated friends, go events vaccine mandated city, wearing mask required.

Vaxx masks - yes. Isolation - no. elaborate second part? foolishly held hope could convince family get vaxxed together day 10 covid plan getting vaccine alone days last symptom hopefully gone. cousin lives rural area, 20-minute drive closest hospital. claims several friends work hospitals. Supposedly friends reporting inundated heart attack stroke patients, vaccine related. Yeah right. Literally making things up. Nothing story checks out.  me, point would wish would let die. Media way faster one usually are. 

The spike protein really crazy, super new. inclination watch growth variants, definitely add one radar. 

Here's original twitter thread original notice it. column, **we set aside (in part experts OSHA statute) question whether OSHA‚Äôs statutory authority supports ETS issued**. Instead, address (because experts U.S. Constitution) solely question whether Congress federal power regulate employers employees ensure workers large businesses vaccinated COVID-19 regularly tested masked. think Congress clearly power Article Constitution Well everyone decide brace not.

But reading many replys below:people idea coming wonder even Fauci does. north east USA 2-4 weeks behind wave northern europe. far lower vaccination rate. simply 5th wave, going worst wave thus far. STOP TRAVELLING  trying get one parent. Every local pharmacy pharmacy-having-grocery store booked. Could get try walk-in still little bit drive uncertainty. There's going vaccine clinic/drive nearby town 2 weeks go to, hoping sooner. Every symptomatic case covid, got hooks immune system playing catch-up, opportunity mutate.
 
Also less spread. don‚Äôt think solid stats point it‚Äôs hard study specific thing. it‚Äôs logical think milder less symptomatic case is, shorter window contagiousness is. Thankfully company (a healthcare system, even) started moving full WFH managers allow it. We're downsizing office footprint, we're in.

Someone pointed takes new CIO (ours retiring soon) dislike WFH they're going lot pissed people space sit office. would likely stay, daughter employee-only daycare, best area (and part healthcare org, good COVID policies). there...I'm almost certainly leaving matter WFH status. There's much chaos craziness amazing.  That's literally reason stepdad got vaccinated. holdout I'm happy least got it. first shot last monday bit sore arm gone now. expecting way worse... taken vaccine sooner. better people. Quarantine work enough people it. Masks enough enough people faithfully wear them. Vaccines endgame could've leaders made political.

I expect thing long tail given enough people taken seriously. expect generation grow masks new normal.  No, it‚Äôs people, likely like yourself, don‚Äôt understand statistics. 

If 40% population (unvaccinated) represent 75% cases hospitalizations obvious. less obvious see 75% population (vaccinated) still represent 50% case rate. break probability clearly see vaccines highly effective looking case rate you‚Äôll likely see portion population represents majority still represent majority cases. way increase capacity arm. already lack doctors nurses. hang trees finally took vaccine last monday. Next jab december 13th. happy finally it. evidence though? There's fine line open possibilities lending credence unfounded theories. Germans nice phrase now. say end winter everyone be, ‚Äúvaccinated, recovered, dead‚Äù. me.

Cap unvaccinated covid beds 10% hospitals capacity, give ivermectin, O2 tank, Bible. Spanish Flu took 2-2.5 years run course. vaccines. Without remarkable developments health treatment. midst world war. 

How long COVID around? approved sooner? got shot soon possible, eagerly wanting get booster. 

The problem I'm student. finals season. can't afford take sick day studying projects due; could happily gotten one month two ago, though.  yeah, Google ""US COVID"" compare Jan/Feb deaths peak one happened. Vaccines natural immunity made recent peak better, although still pretty bad since local governments pretty much given controlling COVID.  good luck pushing shit people lol idk anyone surprised lack ‚Äúimmunization.‚Äù 

We literally lost people vaccines without - something sounds that. 

And call crazy - I‚Äôve two shots plan get booster. think Covaxin Indian one made using inactivated virus. scoop vintage cast iron estate sales. gotta glass half full kinda guy. Bro‚Ä¶ around REST LIVES. It‚Äôs stay. It‚Äôs virus. Non curable. suggest go recluse till die??? Perhaps advanced medication 20 years time like AIDS virus. that, take vaxx move on. That‚Äôs anyone expect expect others.

Vaxxing, plus boosting, pushes covid‚Äôs effect ~0%, already .3% baseline. dangerous things merely walking outside. Short bubble boy, else want do? Good boy fully vaxxed officially two dose either moderna pfizer least 2 weeks ago, pr 1 shot J&amp;J least 2 weeks ago. Honest question, ever come first wave?  got ""cold"" weeks ago initially negative antigen test COVID. week later, somebody I'd contact (who otherwise quite careful) definite COVID symptoms got positive PCR test, went back got PCR test also positive.

So right diseases there, people getting negative COVID tests might still actually COVID. completely honest, taking seriously beginning. social distanced, got vaccinated, I‚Äôm wearing mask, got booster, I‚Äôm patience. Im tired putting life hold people haven‚Äôt done shit protect themselves. Realistically point it'll pills approved.

If US though, ""whenever want"" majority US longer cares. handling pandemic public agencies US fucking awful.

zero apparent effort present unified message, kinds mixed signals flying everywhere true, whatever works. think means ""the US probably 5th wave soon"" drama. workers probably biggest population actually bracing it.

EXACTLY! going get tough.... How?

Look Seattle, nearly zero cases.

The vaccine makes shorter period infectiousness less likely chance getting infected.

They reduce transmission enough nearly everyone vaccinated disease burns out. Also vaccinated far less likely get deep lung infection results aerosolizes droplets super spreading.

Yes, it‚Äôs unvaccinated spreading virus around, filling ICU‚Äôs. That's almost 300,000 US cases could onto things time tell. hope wrong 911 inside job can't believe number people covid once, almost died, still take vax.

Like, jesus christ, know could absolutely finish job time... right? That's kink tho Deaths get much worse next weeks lag effect   Tons people getting booster shots. lots bracing. know vaccinated, brand? wife dies covid 2 weeks later he's saying, masks? think locking developed countries combat something might even know contracted 99.8% survival rate absurd begin with. 

Protect risk, put hypochondriacs back padded cells let adults get lives. statistics. treatments/actions/precautions chance contributing another tick death count (or hell, permanently reduced functionality count matter). institutions working get data people, people use data inform decisions assemble best odds adding another person count within scope resources available them.

People focused looking excuse justify whatever already felt like instead using tools institutions provide contribute preserving health community. I'll let secret. COVID animal hosts. never eliminated. Impossible Sad part Americans make vaccines isn‚Äôt vaccines all. East Asia many European countries much fewer deaths year compared 2020 government people got better dealing it. It‚Äôs absurd isn‚Äôt case US. fact people media would even discussing root problem vax-unvax divide sad. many unnecessary loss lives Florida celebrated making illegal require masks school fire people refuse get vaccinated. I'm sure bracing anything here. sounds like doubling me. also encouraging anyone else country got fired vaccinated move here. best keep Covid party going apparently, thing governor that's left Trump days still gets news coverage. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø Two years long time kid, that's already case families. hope I'm base nobody feels masks necessary time next year, pandemic tapering fast enough yet.  Fully vaccinated implies first shot plus one booster, right? Actually, 85706 PCR tests yesterday 25864 covid cases. 7 day rolling average went 29% 37% seem hit around 41% week end. deaths get adjusted 3 day delays; 48 deaths yesterday double.  I‚Äôm unvaccinated (high risk pregnancy) exposed twice still yet get COVID. get indoctrinated demigod? hate Yeah, work someone stocking shelves death end world quit. start losing people literally keep us alive impactful consequences.

FYI: saying work someone stocking shelves death. offering example. fry

Go different Wendy‚Äôs cook fries better lot getting boosters Still care. Wife got third shot last weekend. know lot same. new normal.

Really? Specialists tired saying kind thing media sensationalism best. understand worries also rational pandemic absurd. Majority Americans care /CDC says  Get house. You‚Äôll fine. Eh, can't stand nausea I'd take sore throat puking day. own.  Maybe people inner circle start dying Covid realize entire planet isn‚Äôt trying punk them. started strep throat caught soon enough turned STSS almost lost foot due (and huge scar emergency surgery it). Sore throats screw around with. Show data 20 latest report show ~63% hospitalized previous four weeks fully vaccinated. Yes, doctor, that‚Äôs exactly happened. six-day medical degree really paying off. Almost worth cardboard it‚Äôs printed on. Also, it‚Äôs delta that‚Äôs really killing people, didn‚Äôt become prevalent till year. God. Imagine lack psychological emotional development takes think solely personal safety perspective. people exist, acting responsibly middle crisis save lives.

If that's good enough probably melting ether absolute thought getting go another concert everything want want it, right now. /s

#THE POINT GETTING VAXXED PARTICIPATE SPREADING LETHAL PANDEMIC PEOPLE DIE don‚Äôt know woman anything wrong. Even daughter lived her, don‚Äôt quarantine vaccinated even direct exposure. think speculation covid could mutate much less lethal contagious virus becomes another common cold.

That may still happen, could take years even decades so....  Viruses generally get weaker, coronaviruses get weaker? really remember much Sars 1 MERS sheer anti-vaxxer audacity/stupidity display. I‚Äôm loop this?    also lot people LOT travel. someone kids 5 childcare, I'm absolutely bracing 5th wave. We've already quarantine 3 times school year. I'm fucking exhausted trying work watch kids home time. yes, definitely bracing here, even everyone else give fuck anymore. may end beating thing covid pills mutations like keep appearing. Man still working 4th wave. really progressive there! literally argument every day. It‚Äôs exhausting. I‚Äôm staying home Thanksgiving Christmas year. moved different state family several years ago job I‚Äôm traveling holidays year. child young still get vaccinated. We‚Äôre staying home. article talking continuing social distance‚Ä¶idk you, me, that‚Äôs putting life hold. find two broad camps people comes WFH -- live sizeable homes enough space dedicated office space made totally separate rest home's living/relaxing spaces much happier permanent WFH arrangements, even actual house backyard, pool, quiet neighborhood, etc.

Those live expensive, tiny cramped city apartment/condo 'home office space' laptop computer set folding table right next bed sofa -- find far keen get back office least part-time, physically unable unplug work go leisure/""me-time"" mode working hours since literally living office space 24/7. orders magnitude worse shutdowns even free time work duties done, fun outside front door closed government order literally nothing except move five feet couch start drinking. pretty soul-sucking blame people wanting get back least something bust monotony. comparison: 

Colorado 5.8 million people, [similar vaccination among adult population, [7 day moving average 2556. 7 day moving average deaths around 30.

South Korea's population 51 million. much so, yes. milder case, hopefully less shedding virus/contagious, shorter period. I'm sure that. may asymptomatic folks sick week never rain suspect could almost contagious actively ill, coughing storm droplets. 
 
And point, less spread, less people spread even more, on. That‚Äôs much untrue sources all. would considered lower income certainly pay taxes people company family owns. That‚Äôs companies use w2 Uncle Sam doesn‚Äôt come knocking door tax time. Masks huge ask realistic, social distancing! Cmon. touch. Someday we‚Äôll hopefully know it‚Äôs antivaxers‚Äô fault something else that‚Äôs keeping strong.  worried. Regulated industry. like proposed bill going anywhere, anyways...  strong start people eagerly waiting vaccine. (People like made appointment morning became eligible.) group vaccinated, left everyone else. Admittedly, confusing since today saw this:  Furthermore, vaccines great job suppressing symptoms serious illness, actually ends creating horde infected vaccinated people asymptomatic idea infected, silently transmit virus around community. reaches unvaccinated, hits them...badly. Lack better option choosing make things worse bad thing. 2 years much denser populations Well good thing requiring vaccinated Yeah, maybe. symptoms definite match. antibody test months later though, came back negative. know. mean... bracing? old bullshit?

I'd never seen funeral procession live COVID. past months I've seen like 5. fuck going here? No, no. Fat people? Really? That‚Äôs dumb thing deny coverage over. they‚Äôre like 600 lber yeah could see maybe ‚Äúreap sow‚Äù kinda‚Ä¶ actually even then, people shouldn‚Äôt left die without coverage weight especially much variance things cause biological level, forgoing cultural behavioral reasons obesity occurs.  Boosted today, side effects time, four days get them. Schools social distancing anymore, packed classrooms like sardines‚Ä¶with masks on. do?? people opportunity get vaccinated. protect themselves. 

Of course want anybody die time. I'm heartless. fully vaccinated boosted. I've done can. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* myocarditis often cause permanent scarring vaccine myocarditis nearly never causes scarring.

Please show peer-reviewed study confirming this. definitely plausible. Viral myocarditis 5 year survival rate around 50%. long term data myocarditis vaccine, long term studies confirming myocarditis vaccine mild, lasts less time importantly whether higher survival push change terminalogy based type severity inflammation now

This reduce public trust science. important differentiate example stage 3 cancer stage 5 cancer, really good idea change terminology make one sound question someone gets inflammation vaccine, body type would extremely severe reaction real covid infection.

This valid question, AstraZeneca seems lower myocarditis risk Pfizer Morderna despite also spike protein. also matters people natural immunity less likely get infected Covid first place, benefit/risk ratio lot smaller (because antibodies usually destroy Covid gets deep body). issue people double vaccinated considering getting booster shot.

I get people promoting Covid vaccines hard time admitting benefit much greater risk, Covid vaccines cause 10x many adverse reaction flu vaccines stated CDC, shown studies also implied VAERS TGA data, allergic reactions cardiac events autoimmune reactions. think far right believe facts data?

Oh sweet summer child basing established studies?

Herd immunity doesn‚Äôt mean goes away, it‚Äôs endemic/not increasing rate spread. 

Why would virus different every virus history?  set up. Thank you. in-laws acting like I'm crazy asking take 15 minute home covid test coming Thanksgiving. partner vaccinated boosters kid young vaccinate. 

Happy hear caution unwarranted. get vaccinated, can‚Äôt seriously believe insurance companies across US wouldn‚Äôt immediately start lobbying politicians try expand kind concept people pay less.

The company family owns part sells health insurance guarantee customers ones super healthy profits would much higher. bullshit think we've established Herd Immunity really thing virus. may come back again. may longer capable job. depends damaged lungs become. Stop providing safety net voluntarily unvaccinated morons. Put tent stash horse dewormer keep hospitals ICUs open rest us. ways, I'm putting life hold anymore. I'm things used do. fact things wearing mask mean life hold.  Polio eradicated. eliminated United States roughly 25 years first vaccine made available. It‚Äôs still endemic today countries. point die. point would like be? Behold: slippery slope argument.  got booster today since got moderna last two, decided stick it. Young healthy person, reasoning similar. Even still pretty well protected severe disease/death, figured extra 50mcg hurt top leading holidays since concerned whatsoever even getting sick covid. bar since early 2020. Christmas year brother friends come town visit, I'd feel pretty darn safe grabbing beers downtown, despite risk. Spanish flu mutated lethal strain mutated less lethal strains still deal century later. city's rate maxes 100% since percentage city's population. Non-residents vaccinated within city part region's rate. European vacation literally canceled today due wife‚Äôs positive test‚Ä¶ four year old even him, pandemic life pretty much remembers. It‚Äôs awful. Same. mom, dad, grandparents &amp; partner 3 shots. still wear masks public &amp; done part pre-vax &amp; post-vax. actually think Government PISS POOR job marketing vaccine!! Trump... administration.

A CLEAR MESSAGE needs communicated yes, vaccinated people become infected Covid, spread it. BUT... vaccinated person unlikely become severely ill it, that's get vaccinated. Back claims undeniable DATA. prevent CASES, prevent severe illness death. help take load healthcare industry. Clear direct messaging needed.  I'm hopeful anything point. H1N1 (Spanish Flu) still much around, brother hospitalized last summer. live place see masks would think Covid doesn‚Äôt exist‚Ä¶ really makes wonder point was.

I see overlooked part big point getting vaccinated far likely live able bodied rather dying disabled.

Masks social distancing nice, miss big picture life health. One argue capitalism created corporatization, consumerism, stifled innovation competition. GASP does, mutations don‚Äôt survive long enough studied. God love South Park. similar mindset. everything supposed - wore masks last year, socially distanced, even volunteered vaccine trial. 

At point, can't help ask - end? People going continue wearing masks socially distancing forever.  Jungle still relevant 100 years later.[The Jungle Upton Sinclair Yeah seriously. Even see someone clinic decently controlled diabetes, decently controlled hypertension, nothing else‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really fussed. well managed, nothing stopping people conditions living long healthy lives.

Assuming don‚Äôt get COVID something like that, course. point mask save folks big risk factors/comorbidities well vaccinated yet, help medical personnel overwhelmed. Fatigue setting though... still spread COVID vaccinated person chance death long haul drastically reduced comparison.

Technically go maskless. Mostly hurts unvaccinated fuck ""doctors"" anti-vaccine summit? mutation occurred untreated immunocompromised AIDS patient, vaccine likely would made little difference. There‚Äôs also mention man Hong Kong vaccinated (but I‚Äôd interested knowing that). 

Honestly think vaccines get us haven‚Äôt paying attention; large pockets animal carriers recently detected could easily produced mutation transmitted back human population. Vaccines aren‚Äôt supposed give full immunity. still get infected. lowers chances getting it, spreading it. still cautious  problem going still adults - adults refuse vaccinate kids. Good news. Yep. That‚Äôs probably many different viruses people need realize this. 

At point, simply matter getting vaccinated, get boosted can, make smart choices, go back life. Oh... tune media. Lol, dude deleted account. aliens land first. get asteroid. /s effects shots.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  want know point was, go ICU unit. Pretty much everyone covid vaccinated.  depends talk to‚Ä¶ coworkers getting tested Thanksgiving. South Carolina. eventually becomes endemic majority folks exposed. way going end without vaccine. Vaccinated Unvaccinated spread Covid. CASES longer relevant number, reported everyday. Even vaccinated person tests positive, unlikely become severely ill. need stop hyper focusing CASE NUMBERS!! I'm getting boosted 12/4. Tomorrow I'm headed antivax area I'm bringing enough food etc go stores f Sure thing, Adrian Veidt!! Viruses historically get weaker said. 

Except humans studying viruses 140 years, meaning thousands years human virus interactions little data on. Lol used 80 hours ‚Äúin debt‚Äù company came back negative vacation time. Thanks generosity coworkers company wide donating PTO pool ‚Äúdebt‚Äù got repaid. basically advance vacation time. I‚Äôm healthcare worker worked active Covid patients. That's correct, what's point trying make? vaccinated areas also ones least prior immunity previous waves, high testing levels, possibly lot early vaccine adopters haven‚Äôt able get booster yet. 

4-5 months second jab, vaccine effectiveness vs Delta infection drops 40% worse. Efficacy vs hospitalisation death still ~90%, it‚Äôs true getting vaccinated pointless. responsible vaccinated people catching colds getting tested, hence terrible spike cases. Jesus. 

Why make much money, instead taking care health, HENCE FUCKING NAME?! 

I really hate country sometimes. day come around. Lol won‚Äôt fault. son vaccinated plus we‚Äôve also covid, but, we‚Äôre staying home nothing tomorrow. wear masks Jesus tell sure Americans. idea rest world act  Sputnik one worst? vector vaccine, like Astrazeneca Janssen. 
CoronaVac inactivated vaccine, older tech. I‚Äôm one case causing discrepancy think. whatever reason, NYS can‚Äôt seem match second shot first vaccination database, also means can‚Äôt get Excelsior Pass. (Which super frustrating. say Walgreens place fix it, Walgreens insists it‚Äôs right even showed data.) think got booster without second shot. It‚Äôs bizarre one fix database apparently. CDC correct info, even NYS can‚Äôt match data right. Funny enough, Fox's staff vaccinated Thank Christ live SF, CA! anecdotes long covid symptoms going away coming back vaccination. would wait 3 months infection getting booster though - that's health departments tell wait unvaccinated infections. mean sorta predicated people getting vaccines bunch idiots suddenly becoming experts refusing measures, vehemently. question was. 

Germany concerned 60 fully vaccinated rate 85%, matters lot comes rates hospitalisations deaths could get really bad week two time. Nobody risk aren‚Äôt anti vaxx idiots. Tell get boosters let things be. exactly need get first doses poor countries issue boosters developed world. Something everyone better everything nothing most. 

But let billionaires starvation exist time, we're fucked. I‚Äôm hopefully spring look lot different. think everyone antibodies one way another‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll dead. Oh no! Anyways 4th wave get better? talking real mask like n95 cloth mask? really suppose 50 y/o unvaccinated covid patient 50 y/o cancer patient, better example current situation. Comparing 50 y/o 90 y/o stupid contrived. hey hurts. least got pfizer booster shot guess (on top 2 CoronaVac doses üòÅ) one exactly brace covid, getting position box virus? personally never got sick. Average cold every 10 years- idea schedule me. Worked bar too. use get massage regularly acupuncture perfect lymphatic system. Stopped since Covid. Yes- yes.  deaths among vaccinated. 

You mask others, vaccinate yourself. Unfortunately fatigue setting vaccinated means justify joining careless selfish folks drop guard. masks come people stop careful

NOW witness happens side joins disregard. darkest timeline unvax. feel bad them. I'm still masking up... I'm tempted start rawdogging vaccination status. mean American death rate really shows this.  Yup, work health department occasionally get called help clinics. lady break asked brand wanted, wanted protection lost parents within week covid want happen kids. physician friend quit practice year, actually last week, like working customer service. going research. Yeah, especially 40 go hospital maybe decade anyway. possible  tests larger gathering

I heard anyone this. decent data. Moderna seems last longest, wane. Israel saw got doses first, breakthroughs got later. 

Still fairly effective hospitalization, booster keeps immune system primed, otherwise time it‚Äôll ‚Äòmothball‚Äô parts system take time respond force. probably better long term anyway pushing yourself.

I lot friends pushed younger paying now. think wear knee brace deal permanent joint pain old sports injury young. saw 5th biggest killer children September October several states. Kids generally low risk death, low risk mortality compared age groups source. Taking precautions avoid top 10 child killer kids like buckeling seat belt play frogger road. think actually two ‚Äòversions‚Äô strep symptoms. common throat aches pains, severe stomach cramps vomiting. lucky enough always get latter version (my throat feels nothing cannot move couch often crying pain). hand, sister gets normal version. think depends person. let tell you, I‚Äôve flu, pneumonia, time, I‚Äôd rather get strep. makes sick I‚Äôm much pain I‚Äôd rather deal flu. I‚Äôm saying person gets stomach version strep, one awful sickness. Actually watched Pat McAfee show, every Tuesday Aaron said nothing covid toe.. next thing know see article saying ""on pat McAfee show Aaron Rodgers revealed covid toe""...no, didn't.

Is Aaron anti vaxx dummy, yes.. media spinning this.  Let's say 50 y/o, unvaccinated 80 y/o, vaccinated one ICU bed. 50 y/o 70% chance survival 90 y/o - 20 % chance survival. triage favor 50 y/o likely survive. 

What proposing give bed 90 y/o **he everything right deserves chance** likely outcome exercise two people dead. irrational. hope see problem suggestion re-evaluating triage ethics. Source? . Cause would, would last year

I see how. Austria lockdown right despite caring lot US.

Its nature quickly viruses spread recede. Nothing last year would significant impact Covid case loads right now.  booster far better 2nd dose. 2nd dose like low grade fever 18 hours bit shot. Could function, wasn‚Äôt fun napped good bit. 

Booster sore/stiff shoulder ~36 hours, slight chills/body ache. kind weird one around here. seems difference sick test positive sick test negative, positives lost taste smell. Whatever negatives pretty nasty though. personally want neither. 

Also, positives tested negative early symptoms, tested taste gone. negatives tested multiple times, negative.  I‚Äôm sure. numbers data don‚Äôt add claim. It‚Äôs easily searchable. Take look Ireland, Gibraltar, Singapore, U.K., Vermont, Colorado, etc. places worse numbers among vaccinated vs unvaccinated. It‚Äôs fascinating see. Spanish flu mutated less lethal strain, we're approaching two years Covid end sight.  I‚Äôm sure case circumstances‚Ä¶ also parents home send kids school Covid simply don‚Äôt want deal them. Also, work secondary school, elementary school.  Let's forget 'the vaccine' thing. Moderna Vaccine 3 times stronger Pfizer. youth vaccine 5 11 1/9th moderna shot. different
dosages different side effects efficacy per age. People often referencing adult moderna 18 yo shot worrying risk 6 yo. Let's least refer shot comments research results. equivalent UK hit right beginning January year (61,000), highest 7 day average UK ever reached (and followed two weeks later nearly 1300 deaths per day less 1% fully vaccinated). 

Currently around 43,000 160 deaths per day one month ago. Since 85+ group around 90% boosted 60-84 group something like 70%. major affect hospital admission rates groups, 40% 30% respectively since start November 20+% reduction case rates age groups.  

That's starting feed reduced deaths too. Boosters important jobs.  Loss taste smell classic covid alpha variant syndrome. Congrats, covid! hellish situation. Parents can't get work government provide good enough safety net. horrible.    Unfortunately appears mostly among unvaccinated (according officials). 

Also disturbing amount children, cleared get vaccine, yet perched back classrooms everyday life. remember news correctly, rate among children 6-12 double age group.

Edit: I'm idiot. article linked place remembered numbers from... Gotta go bed. family vaccinated. really don‚Äôt care people anymore. Get vaccinated. don‚Äôt. Plus antibodies fade regardless acquired.  suspect places seeing dip eventually hit point high enough portion population vaccinated, Covid, died. time, boosters rolling initial vaccine doses less effective certain amount time. wish clear, I‚Äôm bit doubtful. Late march - early April started really opening supply, think 4/19 anyone 18+ could get nationally. Add 2-3 weeks 2nd dose, that‚Äôs early mid may. 

Elderly, immune compromised front line first get vaccinated, first officially eligible boosters. 

May + 6 months November, general population sure could gotten boosters much earlier sticking 6 months last dose guidance. worst covid couple bad days think that's totally acceptable shows vaccine works. vaccinated spread it. don‚Äôt end hospital. unmasked unvaccinated. It‚Äôs nightmare scenario unvaccinated‚Ä¶ made defiance paranoia.  couple weeks recovered, threw full-on toddler tantrum (which seen for, idk 2 years?). non-stop tantrums inconvenience disagreement. much like her, know do. full stars! another wave Covid coming weeks uptick cases? submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Germany quite issues getting vaccinations rolling out. picked June (I think), compared US, quite behind. 

A big part simply lack vaccines, due commitment share rest EU. Lots vaccination centres basically twiddling thumbs. 

So think lack boosters explanation. parent multiple younger children, thank you! guess that‚Äôs plan. Buddy grade school kids told that‚Äôs told. checked friend administrator school another teacher. indeed plan x number kids vaxxed. Thats apparent messaging top sentiment bottom Good idea, get vaccinated. Oh, wear mask.  Relative still antivax. One friends vaccinated go hospital still caught it, they're using excuse vaccine nothing.

When told vaccine stopped worse, said something like, ""we'll see. There's way tell."" Yeah, suck. conspiracy theorists (anti vaxxers, et al.) disinformation war here, firmly backed Fox disinformation ministry. Jan 6 proof insane running asylum. Unfortunately, end winter, suspect pushing near million people killed Covid US. Hard imagine.  many people crossing border daily? I‚Äôd like source backs claim Im surprised vaccinated friends kids vax hesitant. son happy get vaccinated. elaborate? 5 year old daughter well. currently COVID+ Sending vaccinated kid school tested positive?

Wow. Went see movie like choir practice coughing, one person would five others would follow. gota accept we‚Äôre always gonna fucked, there‚Äôs going back lol Doctors reviewed treated actual inflammation stated huge differences vaccine myocarditis covid myocarditis.  push change terminalogy based type severity inflammation now. 

Covid myocarditis often cause permanent scarring vaccine myocarditis nearly never causes scarring. Also, question someone gets inflammation vaccine, body type would extremely severe reaction real covid infection. reason get vaccinated immediately recovery. immune system, fought off, suddenly going go vacation let get sick right away. response vaccine much harsher COVID recovered people.

It's best talk doctor advice. know America everyone's rush get vaccinated immediately recovery, lot world recommends 90 days. seems prudent. least US, expect results elections 2022 kill many mandates, point. believe goes Jon Moxley now, excuse  never stopped I'm surrounded brainwashed, no-masked, unvaccinated chucklefucks every time enter store. changed fries couple months ago. fries garbage now.  I‚Äôm tired shit get vaccinated fuck COVID noble lie whole time. pandemic isn‚Äôt continuing bad actors. forever then

We never win pandemic attitudes ""I'm going wear masks forever"" wanting rush pandemic quickly possible. over.

Start thinking masks normal piece clothing, like woolly hat scarf.  bracing 4th wave USA already 5th.....  I‚Äôm pretty sure will. signs daily infections slowing down. Also really restrictions could slow down. can't imagine (actual, tracked) cases dropping Afghanistan Taliban charge. hate world gets affected much places shit show. I've bunch concerts...outdoors.

Sporting events interest me, did, crowded. College football pro-baseball outdoors.

Go uncrowded restaurants. bunches restaurants. always find uncrowded one going unpopular times. plenty restaurants outdoor seating. what's wrong takeout?  it‚Äôs true effect gets weaker months, elderly vaccinated beginning year, problems get infected.   RemindMe! 1 month  Football brain. Exactly. 

I've slooowly talking people getting first round. process sucks, still glad spent time them. Total measly five people, something.

In every case, social media others around root hesitant. people actually antivax, rather, misinformed... done ""their research"". 

Just give up, folks. messaging 1 month [**2021-12-25 06:30:21 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-12-25%2006:30:21%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide  We‚Äôre got better finding cases. could anything wanted nobody controlled pubs, bars clubs vaccinated would wear masks. Also carnival (11.11) big thing cologne amount people huge. didn‚Äôt hear different stories people carneval clubs. 
The numbers probably much higher too. Regions Sachsen, Bayern Th√ºringen problems note every case they‚Äôre much it‚Äôs much work poor people. 

Right now, even I‚Äôm doubled vaccinated get booster January, I‚Äôm really scared get infected it‚Äôs really frustrating. everyone care vaxxed boosted 9 year old due get 2nd shot next week. masks guy.   7 day average new cases 4.5 times beginning October‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Eu countries contemplating lockdowns /strict vaccine mandates due massive new spikes cases.

Like saw happen Canada yet didn‚Äôt want believe it.  It‚Äôs over. question ""why bother?"" - alive feel frustrated still going. 750k Americans not. Winning feel great days, losing truly truly awful. I'm sorry go that. That's disgusting. company ashamed itself. damn healthcare worker!! deserve better that!! Thank everything hope remain good health holiday season coming year. Definitely right thing also reduce Breakthrough Infections narrative false can't use justify denying treatment people like. Properly secluded first year, even temporarily leaving job (essential, would‚Äôve 5 days week entire time) side work home (I made less worth period time). Vaccinated ASAP, booster ASAP, I‚Äôm back living life now. ever catch hope take antivaxxers   Prior Delta, vaccine good preventing people carriers, well preventing infection. But, Delta happily hang vaccinated nasal passages, immune response weak, spread others there. vaccine still lot prevent serious illness death, longer stops vector spread. IDK path looks like. know vaccine improves odds alive kids behavioral measures fail. That's lot doing. making things better. opinion bit short sighted would say. I‚Äôm one asked two friends mine vaccinated biontech twice. They‚Äôre class positive. Mild symptoms like one mild headaches runny nose nothing.
Still frustrating got sick. vaccinated June/July.  make less 2021 true lower incomes $75k going back many years. 

It something ashamed of. think bad thing lower income people pay taxes, stupid pretend do. shit end man... want right thing almost two years life gone past right thing change. never happen   7/100k die? make sense. That's death rate .007%, like entire population New Jersey died. missing? really interesting. I'm fully vaccinated Pfizer (2nd dose July 24). I'm eligible booster yet Canada. 3 4 weeks ago, suspect got ""nicked"" virus work. light cough, slight temperature, extremely fatigued 3 days. bit shortness breath days. sneezes there. chalked allergies time (it kind tail end allergy season). always wear mask bit low-ish community transmission time wearing cloth mask.

So days ago, get weird itch chest shower. tiny little blister burst. Next day, get weird itch side waist. Two tiny little blister spots. thinking myself...shit, kind feels like chicken pox. then, now...I read this. 

Glad I'm vaccinated. think get booster I'm eligible. debating it...not really sure would even need one...but yeah...then see makes go...hmmmm...

I've wearing respirators work since think got hit bit. Maybe good idea keep wearing respirator masks double mask cloth surgical mask underneath. really thought cloth mask would sufficient getting vaccinated...but think I'm wrong now.       sources this?  hope defeated. allowed go forward, would create precedent denying coverage pre-existing conditions.

Access medical care right everyone, including unvaccinated. know 5 people, personally, recently. 2 shots got sick.. 2 got FUCKED UP‚Ä¶. Parts family got 2 shots decided get anymore anti-Vaxers, think covid vaccines scam.  personal opinion, Fox responsible MANY, thousands? Millions? deaths brought justice. Jeez depends though. Yeah stand little away somebody. abiding rules time would mean sporting events, concerts, crowded restaurants, etc. also entirely false information, sources. pay around 10k tax year get back around 3k. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre insistent lying try demonize lower income individuals. certainly don‚Äôt receive enough transfer income make difference. you‚Äôre making things up. Why? made clear opinion is, found someone shares it. Bravo.

Yeah man, American Medical Association, fuck full shit rite? 

What fucking illiterate moron. Bro everyone see post afraid failing basic math test get entry level government job. really position attack anyone intellect.  gov isn‚Äôt kidnapped year! accelerated. Astrazeneca one better vaccines producing antibodies 70% effectiveness Delta ""shitty"" rep deaths caused due thrombosis. wanes fast 6 months, booster really necessary. Mix MRNA vaccine get good boost.   No, think pay taxes actually get back pay. get transfer income actually pay. parents, even vaccinated parents, unfortunately getting kids vaccinated covid all, certainly wouldn‚Äôt giving dose them. Even parents got kids vaccinated actually would make sense medically parents get vaccinated made choose. agree mark though. literally approved less two weeks ago, adults recently approved booster shots. can't pretend gonna make difference. sucks will, please, love Almighty, get idiots anti-vaxxers vaccinate young kids endangered groups survive lead normal lives!  This, I‚Äôm done. got shots. Unless vaccine suddenly isn‚Äôt worth damn don‚Äôt care  hospitals non-profits operate low single digit net revenues. small fraction making major ""profit"" grand scheme things, even executive compensation packages drops bucket overall system.

The health system work 4% operating margin 2019 like $185 million system wide, like 30,000 employees.

The places healthcare profit (or wasteful) essentially suppliers everything used healthcare. Prosthetic joints, medications, imaging machines, etc. 

As example, US spends $2,500 per person/year administrative costs prescription drugs, pay astronomically money exact drugs sold fraction pay reason bring problem hospitals executives rolling cash (because generally aren't) every part health industry making record profits year year hospitals struggle barely break even, addressed Obamacare literally legislation currently promoted. Pfizer's shareholder forward guidance estimated $36 billion dollars revenue vaccine alone year estimated $22 billion 2022, estimating roughly 44% total revenue coming vaccine. also multi billion dollar oncology, hospital, internal medicine divisions making billions profit year. system disjointed. basically profit model that's treated independent business organizations however half system treated profit public companies (Pfizer, Merck, hill-rom) half (places providing direct care) treated public service without funding supports traditional public services have. also generally matter whether single payer whatever since anything fix actual problems healthcare, make individuals go broke seeking care. Everyone involved still going make absolutely record breaking profits single payer system, would coming taxes instead current model health coverage we'd struggling boat medicare/medicaid even comes ""accreditation"" hospital, essentially extortion money system. Joint Commissions private non-profit ""accredits"" health care organizations charges hospitals facilities fees maintain accreditation. something done TONS different accreditations like stroke thrombectomy, burn, etc.

Per wikipedia, Joint Commission charges $37,000 fees annually studies done show Joint Commission accredited even lower mortality readmission rates.

Just like corporation, hospital positive net revenue ultimately go close entirety revenue comes providing healthcare services. provide health services must purchase supplies companies who's goal maximize shareholder profits spend billions every year lobbying congress make sure happens.  International credit card imposes average fee 3.5% merchants (plus fee maintain POS machine clearing house) fee AliPay/WechatPay somewhere 0.1-0.6%. suprised fewer fewer merchants would accept int'l plastics. wealth moving way pre-covid? got booster that‚Äôs told me.  So

This I‚Äôm teacher TG break, 6 90 students COVID. I‚Äôve COVID one time since March.

Students quarantine parents muscle onto campus symptoms. So, quarantined kiddos sitting next non-quarantined. grandparents live upstate, hour west Albany thruway (I-90), covid run entire apartment complex mostly elderly people, one neighbors bad ended hospital weeks, lucky shes recovering home now. bad told us come visit agree with, also really sad. People stupid. good reason get booster. got mine Moderna. I‚Äôm you- turn fetal weeping ball time I‚Äôm gastric distress/have nausea haha  booster shot worst side effects me,

The side effects booster (headaches, weird muscle stuff) mild shot #2, lasted longer. Pfizer shot #2 February weird muscle spasms aches day, kick till day shot. gone. 

When got booster (late Sept first approved people pre-existing conditions), started feeling weird even left CVS. evening headaches, felt kinda cruddy. headaches day weird muscle pains two days. arm stiffness days think left arm swelling too.

People's reactions map. wife hardly reaction Moderna shots March Pfizer booster October. heard something going around? know. I'll swing tractor supply next week stock various livestock medicines Raar America bad  Like stopped wearing them‚Ä¶love mask. never understand idiots said COVID ‚Äújust flu!‚Äù last flu knocked ass five days. MISERABLE. never miss annual flu shot haha  government though, Fauci Tedros still making fear mongering statements based cases rather hospitalizations deaths. ""parents"" ""live"" protest rabble districts forcing kids wear masks.    forget broke 300,000 pretty sure hit 280,000 least twice. aren‚Äôt random people vocal anti-vaxxers misleading anyone listens advice doctors.  tested waste water traces Covid virus August 2021 levels 320% year ago. Yeah, promise.   fish could scream, ocean would be‚Ä¶fucking loud.

Mitch    start pandemic. 

Then lost respect. handled pandemic absolutely terribly. Every step way. I'm fully vaccinated, mask much still. longer trust put interest public health first.  opposite bracing? work big store ate mom pop stores little town. Store full today, one fourth properly masked. lot employees slip every chance get wear chin. county half vaccinated cases hospitalizations climbing since Halloween. care less. Hoping booster works Black Friday. really depends quickly get children vaccinated. children vaccinated measles 2 US. get high uptake children vaccinated, think it'd achievable.

It's hard say country really hit close threshold pointed out, Ireland 76%.

That said, additional boosters still affordable hospitalizations. sounds pretty bad considering Canada 2600 cases today I‚Äôd fine treating like that: trend past one really cares today XD  credit card... archaic way living. patriotic. That's quite compliment! Thank you! I've got little kids can't get vaccinated yet exhausting. someone went high school posted dad COVID put vent. 2 days birthday 2 days Thanksgiving. yeah, I'll take precautions fatigue comes it.   Well asked second dose date nurse so‚Ä¶ vaccination effective thought missing something?  stance outdated thinking regards covid think. scientists agree herd immunity achieved vaccine, reduce hospitalizations.

Even actually think said true, true people get booster every 6 months, right? Vaccine effectiveness drops quite bit time especially older people    contagious either way, moment.

Unless test wrong false negative, there's threshold test turns positive still able transmit (which article PCR tests also can't determine active inactive viral material 

Neither antigen tests.

If want test infectious virus need cell cultures plaque assays BSL-4 lab. gotta live life, certainly. caution still called for. vaccines 100%. life save may own. One risk balance others. did, although job mask optional team building day week ago one wearing mask That's rough man. Good luck üôè boomers run world decided sacrifice lives sanity schoolchildren, way boomers run world decided put seriously dealing climate change they're comfortably dead.  Eh, quarantine work enforced *soldiers checkpoints*, like Australia. virus gets out. That's viruses do. totally agree. Thinking long term, scary increased global connectedness, evolutionary pressure virus kill slowly (or all) order thrive gets less less.  people vaccinated, less future look like past 2 years. Wearing mask, particularly customer, trivial inconvenience really excuse cases high. still managing behavior based number cases goal keeping community spread low level. enough people vaccinated potentially go long periods time restrictions, provided willing put place (and actually follow them) case rates get hand.

Also wasted bar Malaysia without knowing get home

...is really really bad idea might helping case much think. Polio R0 value 5 7 requires \~80%.

Measles R0 12 18 requires 93-95%.

COVID Delta R0 6 7 we'd looking 85+% vaccinated people.

Even Ireland, sited, 75% vaccinated.

The problem report percentages one Europe's highest vaccination rates, 89.1% people age 12 immunized

But consider Ireland's total population, they're 76%, polio threshold.

But that‚Äôs necessarily cause concern. ‚ÄúWhen reach herd immunity threshold population, doesn‚Äôt happen sudden, like flipped switch. won‚Äôt New York Times headline saying nobody disease,‚Äù explains Saad Omer, MBBS, PhD, MPH, director Yale Institute Global Health. ‚ÄúWhat happens reduces indigenous, endemic, transmission virus.‚Äù spread disease gradually even herd immunity threshold attained, still smaller outbreaks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs vaccine coverage always uneven. places embers spark local fires,‚Äù Dr. Omer Ireland total vaccination Polio/Measles COVID R value.

tl;dr: Yes, vaccine works due vaccine hesitancy children vaccinated, still outbreaks. Additionally, unvaccinated people tend unvaccinated clusters evenly spread throughout population. financial support *done* America, much small businesses start with. again, regular people millions savings left figure mess.  *How widely?*

I'm saying may true they're substituting sinovac there's anything wrong vaccine.  vaccine ailments?  I'm vaccinated get tested gatherings, afterwards stay away people 1-2 weeks test again. know everyone can, do. limit gathering though, still comfortable hanging un-vaxxed people. maybe I'm mad idk. Iowa unfortunately. I'd disowned found anyways, God knows else ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Mi constant vital records reviews. 143 deaths found vital records searches. So, 140 deaths two days bad, bad looks headline. sure are, depending state live in, [you might need states, need parents permission, even minor.  1st world countries prioritizing 3rd world countries. still something needs explained?

-First world countries get good amount citizens boosted, takes couple months year. -Meanwhile 3rd world countries don‚Äôt get access vaccine fast virus unprotected reservoir people grow mutate couple months year‚Ä¶ 
 
So no. They‚Äôre boosters, they‚Äôre scientists understand virus doesn‚Äôt give fuck wealth efficiency country chooses vaccinate citizens first within human made borders. 

Good thing international air travel doesn‚Äôt exist though, that‚Äôll keep virus check. Yah, fields life death unvaccinated coming inside house. Direct link 5m 30s country powerful U.S.? Man‚Ä¶.that would awesome. would pay nice vacation.  year ago, Delta leapfrogging across vaccinated folks hitting viral loads several times original strain. least US, damn near beat. National new case numbers really low. Delta made way we're back big waves again. change response matches surface level content conspiracy theories, motives. political leaders taking control. Hell, risk losing power/office pushing life- saving unpopular rules. Conspiracy theorists predicted bit ""what"" right lot ""why"" wrong. least suspicion (founded not) motivated defiant behavior blunted effectiveness milder countermeasures. Actions (or, case, inactions) consequences. don‚Äôt CARE families medical debt bad credit scores forever - chose ignore safe effective vaccination. Fuck‚Äòem got first shot second shot delayed covid inbetween. mild case went pass like flu. Cant take second till jan .       point, can't help ask - end?

Well, anytime soon. China country knows play game. need super careful really play hardball virus want win. Every location even handful new infections found immediately combed carefully. Absolute country numbers meaningless comparisons. Personally, autoimmune skin issues exacerbated shot. that's kind expected risk. that, sizeable communities (both local reddit) discussing post-vax effects. believe every story, even discount large part hypochondriacs coincidences, patterns hard ignore. less likely end hospital IC. Therefore hugging wearing mask less risky. Turns many cases ""fuck ton infections""x""small chance"" =""a lot people hospital"". Especially unvaccinated people still get contaminated vaccinated. /r/hesnotwrong ... know first lol Unfair comment. literal tears right now. I'm 76, fully vaxxed, remember getting polio shots typhoid shots dpt shots young, remember almost dying hard measles vaccine. mumps ""little"" measles chickenpox, vaccines. Tomorrow Thanksgiving 2nd year row family. can't risk it. lung problems pretty certain covid would kill make wish dead. family members work public even though vaxxed, still exposed daily basis. breakthrough cases us 65 depressingly high. stop goddam senior bashing. I'm sick it. bad anti vaxxer lowering morale. family it. Especially 20-30 year olds going concerts, weddings, brewerys. Tested pre Thanksgiving grandma

Edit- word Trust me, least new government forbids lockdowns compared Merkel wanted another one 5th? rid it, tons misinformation ruining things, I'm glad many still taken shot safer last years holiday season election season pretty intense though Good you. personally though. disruptive people's lives. Sporting events incredibly crowded. Sports like basketball indoors. Many concerts indoors. time go restaurants unpopular times (besides, defeat purpose everyone this?)

Having avoid things want putting life hold. willing while, feels like we're asked keep try compensate done nothing. right, see confusion coming from. Tax codes based income yes also number dependents have. HOUSEHOLDS families dependents paying little taxes long time, doesn‚Äôt translate general statement everyone making lower income paying taxes though that‚Äôs incorrect. THANK  Oh sweet summer child   one best comments I‚Äôve ever read puts frustrations perspective. Sorry downvotes, thank you. drove neighboring city get first shot. live LA went Compton. prepared go way Twentynine Palms needed to. wanted first day eligible. lot young liberals Los Angeles went Riverside get shots LA short Riverside fill even half appointments. 

Now easily acceptable, feel like get offered booster pretty much every time leave house. mine weeks ago. goalposts keep getting moved

Of course goalposts keep getting moved, situation changes time. like making movie script write small details lay precise production schedule. Instead, dealing unpredictable beast nature.   Honestly, 2 vaccinated people dating steadily likely big deal others. Speed dating hooking multiple people per week anther matter. Maybe careful go around days right date. mom too! received doses early spring somehow went rabbit hole, says doctors lie us government mandate totally believes mind control nanotechnology nonsense. Sheesh. course refusing booster run away suppose!  science pretty clear herd immunity achievable vaccine required unvaccinated small children things like attending concerts.  woke roommates laughing this. likely die relative causes, higher risk car related death adult? quick search suggests latter false. hope luck continues hold. much longer now? It‚Äôs 80 cases per day Seattle proper right now, 11 per 100,000 residents. That‚Äôs hardly zero. mean ""almost"" time? recommendation 6 months, go want.

Also comfort, starting look like immunity shortly booster higher immunity shortly second dose mRNA vaccine.

Noticed couldn‚Äôt taste food start week- sucks cus wife &amp; 3 boys 5.   feel bad young people. fair anyone enjoys socializing going out.

This objectively ridiculous statement young people country high vaccine access.

People socializing going out.  likely CTE Also, total population estimate last available census 2010. get stats reading Germany, 60k vaccinated persons got infected.  Tell don‚Äôt understand funding US without telling don‚Äôt understand I'm pregnant encouraged get booster protect chance circulating antibodies may give baby protection, like dtap boosters.    Same!  either masked fully vaccinated anymore   professions people batshit crazy. actually fairly sensible idea. two versions polio vaccine: one intramuscular injection, oral. oral vaccine contains live weakened polio virus actually superior vaccine many ways. easy administered. Vaccinators need vial vaccine sugar cubes. Sometimes even that. remember whoever gave vaccine squeeze face open mouth put drops told swallow. Injected vaccine requires needles, clean needles, needle disposal methods. Oral polio vaccine develops strong immune response gastrointestinal tracts actually people contract polio: ingestion. Oral polio vaccine simply effective injected polio vaccine

The downside? weaken virus kral polio vaccine small chance reverting full-strength polio virus cause disease. version use depends whether living polio endemic region not. polio endemic region, benefits efficient vaccine outweight risks. baseline risk catching polio low, thanks to, know, herd immunity may be? sensible use less efficient lower risk vaccine.

A nasal inhalation vaccine respiratory virus actually sensible. one, makes administration simpler unlikely cause issues purported cause adverse reactions Astra-Zeneca vaccine: injection systemic circulation. Second, likely create robust immunity site people likely first contact virus: respiratory system.  Covid numbers like stock market. dips keeps going No. I‚Äôm vaccinated, get booster, done living differently. wear mask forever, not.   Get vaccinated, turn news, live life. insanity expect vaccinated people continue distance live normal life. thanks, make assessments. point? Well vaccine effective improve it, make better, change technology maybe,... Sure know vaccine limitation exactly limit? need detailed statistics answer question, thats whole point. Covid recovered? good vaccine. call 100+% vaccination rate 101 % bullshit...

&amp;#x200B;

(Yes read article know based old data/externals, still cant vaccinate 100.03%)  loss taste smell couple months

That sounds like COVID. One German political hack saying something ‚â† ‚Äúthe Germans saying‚Äù Haha right goalposts keep getting moved

Yeah, bad nostrada... mean Dr Stran... mean CDC figure novel virus worked would headed two years time.

I bet calculation went wrong amount dumbass anti-vaxxers people following recommendations think decide virus stop working. Yep. got hit H1N1 normally mild flus past. one sent ER severely dehydrated could died. could avoided ignored ex-wife's drama argument needing get vaccinated. course docs nurses tell bad condition released hospital.

After incident, get flu shot every year. Lessons learned (including f-ton money give 4 nights stay, 7 litres saline, .5 litre magnesium, bland hospital food). Also, coworker lost daughter H1N1.

Please f-around find out. H1N1 joke flu.    blame game always stupid Lmao no. People tired stuff. Time live life. think social distancing 2 years rational thing try force everyone else you‚Äôre bad anti vaxxers cold going around nursing home. people started getting cold didn‚Äôt pay much mind. Well, mistake. 25 cases Covid now. CMS won‚Äôt stop visitations even let people back covid unit. think problem lies vaccinated still going die, old frail. It‚Äôs nice thing say, it‚Äôs true. Jansserna gang  Google ‚Äòprotein covid vaccines‚Äô find documents explain slow process making traditional protein vaccine covid. One linked nature, 8th Nov image list current protein vaccines mix. Australia, parts world, unvaccinated getting pushed get vaccinated ostracised society - access places social gathering work places. 

**FOR RECORD, 2x vaxxed Pfizer**

IMO gov Aus forthcoming addressing risks associated getting mRNA vaccines (the heart inflammation blood clots). purely saying risk getting covid worse anything else (anyone degree separation gone though covid related death test that), still doesn‚Äôt draw line implication: get this, roughly 0.5% worlds vaccinated population negative effect mRNA type vaccine, part statistic negatively react? That‚Äôs enough people know say: No, won‚Äôt getting currently offered vaccine. 

That regardless it‚Äôs ability reduce hospital transmissions, people saying exact things - what‚Äôs point would risk it. 

So get it. I‚Äôd love someone chime comment protein vaccines sound like silver bullet. Approval antiviral merk Pfizer critically ill, first stages infection risk. It‚Äôs sanctimony; they‚Äôre speaking experience (probably hard-hit area) you‚Äôre speaking yours. situations COVID-wise same, indeed sound ridiculous callous one another.

All I‚Äôm saying is, cases area happen low, there‚Äôs need ask people ‚Äòwtf they‚Äôre talking about‚Äô.  That‚Äôs reasonable criteria. middle pandemic, you‚Äôre suggesting administer vaccine know extremely effective, don‚Äôt know long effective? isn‚Äôt possible know long effective amount time passed, might take years better understand level protection time?

Come now. may well go get die done  nurse myself, I‚Äôve screaming need stop acting like staffing good pandemic. went shittier. I‚Äôm nursing home nurse often 25+ patients bare minimum CNAs. Also, CMS allowing free reign visitation again, significant Covid positive population now. I‚Äôm fucking tired  bad messaging, thing frustrate people vaccinated already breaking point. 
You can‚Äôt beat virus, it‚Äôs contagious it‚Äôs never going away. recommendation get vaccinated move on. ok even get it. 
People advocating continue masking social distancing missing point. I‚Äôm sorry much risk maybe take precautions stop insisting everyone else flu job look like ass still go without asking look. love that. make since 2020 love   think make big difference. teacher witnessing what‚Äôs happening schools I‚Äôd shocked lot spread isn‚Äôt asymptomatic kids schools. Even symptomatic kids could getting spreading school cause lot parents don‚Äôt get kid tested get sick. Delta variant. Simple that.

Waaaay contagious. vaccines!

Our science may good greed still vastly outpacing it.    correct.

The German medical system actually pretty good high number ICU beds. way infection count rising, question time till hospitals overloaded quality care going down. love double meaning April got first shot. remember thinking ‚ÄúAmazing, June.‚Äù Sweet summer child. don‚Äôt understand people.

I‚Äôm triple vaccinated, time since pandemic started I‚Äôm actually convinced skeletal, immune-suppressed arse won‚Äôt die. Fair. please also mindful English speaking cultures ""jab"" may seemingly negative connotation.  J&amp;J chance close 100% 8 months. wish governments would push second doses J&amp;J folks more. Drug approvals slow lot good reasons.

Just time approved mean always like this.  Prime Minister Morrison last week said government believe making vaccines mandatory, saying Australians ‚Äúsick‚Äù told do. 

This week, Prime Minister Morrison told aboriginals NT get vaccinated soon possible.

You can't make shit up. Okay, any? important compare absolute numbers, rates per 100k similar. like seat belts. Majority car fatalities wearing seat belt, mean protect us, means majority wear one. 

But deaths reduced massively. would rather people hospital dead.

In UK, becoming clear unvaccinated clogging  UK. Pandemic effectively here, restrictions basically ended July come back. government repeatedly said lockdowns we'll see happens. Case numbers really matter since vaccine chances hoptialisation low, thing matters hospital numbers deaths.  friends got sick 5 months.

Saw right 

Like claimed elderly underlying causes kiddos could die 

When reality also people age (i 20's mind you) dying it, elderly people underlying causes dying also.

Things bad Trump, CDC, whoever else responsible fucking economy, spreading misinfo actually done better job whole Pandemic.    whole US, rolling average, group.

I looked New Jersey. There's 8.882 million 2019 census, 28,307 covid deaths, makes 318 per 100k. absolutely delusional think people wearing masks end 2019/start 2020 would stop pandemic happening first place. Probably something mandate want vocally +1 visibility/credibility. I've common colds may times (likely 30+ times life), far know I've flu once.

The common colds lasted 2-4 days most. one time flu lasted week. vast difference uncomfortable experiences were. flu far worse. approaching year 2. first started getting reported dec 2019. Hospital worker here. bracing. work well enough mitigate high numbers unvaccinated people go back living like 2019.

I live area 90+% 2-dosed wearing masks indoors, kid's school perfectly normal year far. exposures, shutdowns, online learning, bunch kids. 

She's thriving perfectly fine wearing mask indoors even little uncomfortable her.

Everything basically open city outside indoor masks, vaccine passports, still dancing indoor venues.

Head hour two outside city things conservative religious vaccine rate much lower schools mess - constant exposure warnings, shutdowns, overwhelmed hospitals. even areas still upwards 70+% fully vaccinated.

Vaccines helping, unless get buy-in people, vaccinated enough go back living life like Delta running rampant. Well, that's one way spice Thanksgiving. Yes, vast majority deaths 2021 first 3 months year, tail end winter spike cases, people vaccinated. Yes, title comments making sound like think vaccines effective, rather frustrated uptake. frustration 1/3 refuse get vaccinated, wouldn‚Äôt also take predications beginning pandemic. Meaning natural immunity yet cases coming back again. getting reinfected? cheap covid pills pills flu, cold communicables becoming new normal

what leads renniasance public healthcare could well following CDC guidelines, fully vaccinated wearing mask. Hell, even _if_ empathy deficit, think would willing something inconsequential getting vaccine (typically 30 minutes time spent, typically worst mild fever ache side effect) people advising too.

It must really be, like said, _hefty_ empathy deficit, unfortunately. 90% vaccinated low incidence rates Santa Clara county? think rejected move Silicon Valley right pandemic‚Ä¶  ... people upset remark knew talking them... point health officials making is, ‚Äúavoid risk others get vaccinated. virus widespread within population one escape exposure.‚Äù cause around lot different people want make sure I‚Äôm putting family members risk.  Stepping style woolly hat surgical mask beat cell immunity initially since replicates fast. Decent antibody titers required prevent infection.     Great, cured Covid.  yikes Vaccinated kid?

Wow. wearing N95. fun you‚Äôre spending six hours layover Miami airport lol. 

They‚Äôre much better cloth masks comes preventing glasses fogging though sound psychotic. airborne HIV, virus negligible IFR anyone 50, healthy people.  criteria first COVID-19 males infected virus 6 times likely develop myocarditis received vaccine.

Young males vaccinated 6 times less likely develop myocarditis *after covid infection*. Even 100% vaccinated 0.1% breakthrough case still much. always prevent inflected. Take virus. you‚Äôre doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs over. Contributed testing well current wave.

Germany increased testing around 30%, also positive rate quadruple.

More testing usually mean finding cases, mean infection rate higher, increasing positivity rates also leads testing, giving even bigger jump numbers. Makes much harder see significantly underlying pattern is.

Over last month UK cases gone 35-50k per day, testing also moved 700k 1.1 million, movements positive cases driven changes numbers tests. positivity rate remained 3.5-6.5%.

The UK many tests per day Germany per week, smaller population. lot scope increases cases driven testing, plus impact new wave top that. ‚ÄúI impacted financially virus therefore virus exist‚Äù ""Fully"" vaccinated.  would surprised vaccine useful excuse deliberately delay vaccination will, authorized, move goalposts yet somewhere else.

That said, even one person getting vaccinated Novavax still gain. mention novavax seems highly effective probably suitable people allergies lipids mRNA shots. vaccine's problem. people refuse take are. Put blame due. That's people refuse get vaccinated. as?   Lol nothing intelligent say  hurts much hear that. feel you. wish people could stop fucking careless. worries covid don‚Äôt compare hope know others like still understand care world full fucking idiots   kind situation, need strong government make decision.

It painful take serious government. I'm even going remotely argue absolute shitshow Trump. was. much better Biden helm? Biden still declared victory summer dropped mask recommendation. Yes, supposed vaccinated, come on, really believe going happen. messaging horrible. start. still now. get boosted messaging debacle latest example.

So I've concluded, matter Trump Biden helm. much deeper that. There's something broken public health establishment US.    fucking title articles better way?   What's going UK, virus seems control? appreciate studies problem right now. We‚Äôve got overwhelmed hospitals positivity rate MI people won‚Äôt get vaccinated behaving thing it‚Äôs not. Get vaccinated, get boosted, get kids vaccinated. sooner everyone does, sooner nightmare - whether plexiglass not. already has. kind foods available nothing like enjoyed fifty years ago. globally-distributed industrial stuff now, cruel, unsustainable, foul-tasting.

Why hard people understand? prefer alternatives? know don't.  real problem one knows truth believe. still people won‚Äôt touch utensils frequently squirt hand sanitizer even though it‚Äôs proven Covid spread air. 

Lack consistent messaging anywhere people still mix weird preventive measures different sorts transmission. point time, yes-ish (not sure 'do want' entails), probably yet. sure percentage population provides herd immunity; Canada looks nice (76% 18?), since (yet) include kids, probably enough. 

The big problem that, since new illness, know. example, Portugal, Europe, higher vaccination rates over-18) 4x cases month ago; deaths increased, usually delayed month, may nothing, may strain health system again; know.

Chances are, year two (yeah, sucks :), better idea vaccination rates 'safe' (acceptable?) society.

Life back normal area outside masks schools job. really apply position sun  fascinating chart rate different virus spreads, delta like 8-9 chicken pox 10-12, measles 19. like nuclear option. lol course true get infected. saying two-vax protection cut half 90 days. number variables. Yes, is. can't predict child get gravely ill. Also, children pass people get sick. vaccine harmless, really upsides it. spreading misinformation? makes better anyone else same? law anyone fly list also allowed guns get passed? knows, depends deadly is. it‚Äôs deadly Delta that‚Äôs real bad. I‚Äôm really hoping get virulent strain that‚Äôs deadly start thinking flu. absolutely correct. ""Being annoying"" may illegal, absolutely arrested annoying (a nuisance) broad criminal charges.  times like admire China. Targeted sanctions individual troublemakers. Imagine scan mugs fill gas price doubled list. n ever specified legend leaves interpretation ‚Äúestimated distribution income taxes‚Äù title figure. Meaning it‚Äôs presenting accurate information even implausible Nope. survive long nature here. mink farms, source escaped mink.

Get now? yet politicans seem absolutly problem chaning opinions blink. vaccinated gives far longer lasting immunity natural immunity. 

You idea talking about. variant really set everything back square one people fear, then? can‚Äôt see people already exhausted lockdowns restrictions accepting another round right believed end sight.  think much ""science"" behind putting plexiglass everywhere.  No. Second vaccine shot end.  Covid reaches endemic state? It‚Äôs already clear never go away. Would wear masks long Covid exists, long pandemic? think depends are. average person, yeah, certainty continue spread / outcompete Delta, there's evidence virulence yet.

If charge public health response, think would appropriate contain variant, least studied more. Things like travel restrictions way late past, there's already significant community spread. think would totally appropriate limit travel SA now.  Yeah know they‚Äôre trying stay calm they‚Äôre holding emergency meetings fun.  99.7% survival rate land licenses suspended. Pretty much. someone antivaxxer, I'm gonna baby arse, gotta deal world passerby might infect them. choice go yolo vaccinated live life.

I one first people city wear mask start pandemic, still remember ""wtf"" looks people local shopping mall. I've done part living bubble, enough enough.   Never mind then... secret list banned citizens right challenge expectation fairness equity applied. Yeah that's gonna me, dawg.

Maybe airlines need examine atrocious customer service. There's reason everybody hates them.   100% odds vaccines completely ineffective astronomically low. Efficacy could certainly drop, still provide protection. Yup. Like Vegas Delta old mutation.. joke believe delta variation now... Corona mutates fast flu... ssh, believe delta still already de middlenof alphabet ‚ÄúThey‚Äù don‚Äôt control virus mutates ser really. Chickenpox measles significantly infectious. context, Delta thought around 5-8). Hopeful thinking guess.  anti-vaxxer people use kind stuff proof science flawed, science simply revisionist better data presents itself. proof works, figuring complex spread patterns, indication failure develop new hypothesis.

That always bothers me, people bright. Anti vaxxers use justify getting vaccine probably. data current vaccines effective ?  Oh okay. saying people crappy. definitely early evidence outcompeting Delta handily, there's good chance infectious. think I've heard anything virulent is, right front.

There's also good reason believe vaccines may less effective it, since large number mutations spike protein. Let‚Äôs honest it‚Äôs gonna stay localized  Absolutely, life.  Prosecution minimum. 

These folks put terrorist fly list decade. 

Air travel right. point tracer quarantine protocols? double edged sword virus since specific shape spike protein allows gain access cells first place. 

At point think say virus considerable leeway mutate spike protein still retaining high affinity cell entry.

It may able maintain extraordinarily high fitness Delta, new immune escape serotypes seem pretty well destined emerge.

At time there's pangolin spikes we've found higher affinity human ACE2 Delta right could indicate there's even room improvement virus.

I'd like believe Delta optimum fitness virus, immune escape come cost fitness, can't prove logic alone. real litmus early stage lies man Hong Kong. flight infected didn‚Äôt test positive several days landing. word vaccinated nothing he‚Äôs ill. hope they‚Äôre watching carefully. Well DUH!       museums, know museum dedicated it. museums dedicated Spanish Flu? Could also Moderna 3x dose pfizer? Moderna 100 micrograms (except booster 50) pfizer 30? genuinely wondering. Flu mutates constantly. That's vaccination relatively ineffective it. There's indications spread fairly rapidly outcompeting Delta outbreaks happening.

As well, lot mutations spike protein, definitive proof vaccine escape worrying sign current vaccines may less effective variant.  Delta also evades antibodies certain amount, know right point delta emerged lab tests, can't see virus ""overwhelms"" immune system not, see well antibodies bind. Hum. right, - here's thing. There's quarantine, there's isolation. Florida test, given direction based upon situation. exposed, quarantine. sick, supposed isolate. 

We protocols, there's one monitor cases effectively. Case investigators supposed find ""origin"" ""primary case"", get stay put away others. called *isolation*. 

Then COVID Contact tracers jump find primary case with, try contact them. Anyone exposed *quarantine*, get tested. 

Meanwhile, anyone tests positive put touch Community Service Coordinators, see sick person's needs *can* stay home. arrange pay cannot work, food delivery, laundry service, thing person might need, like someone else care pet sick.

Right Florida barely enough tracers follow small portion cases. Community care lost. hotels isolation. heard one across hospital Tampa, closed. need food delivery, set app. Laundry service? I'm betting that's never thing here. 

The Contact Tracers sometimes monitor cases, again, terribly busy, I'm guessing falls wayside often. purpose monitoring remind patient *stay home*, *stay isolated*. 

Florida depends upon patient right thing. entirely voluntary, terribly unfortunate people disregard information suggestions given. part, I'm afraid public cannot depended upon. That's part rut. part failure government hire enough investigators tracers. It""s sad state affairs. gonna replace Delta huh? virus mutating god damn hard? influenza many mutations too? Every wave accompanied wishful thinking. Wishful thinking terrible record far. ""Wait see"" wrong approach. ""Act see"" better approach. Coronavirus continue tee us accept reality.  Quite likely 10 last week then. New York City please shut international travel time? spread much unvaxxed.

I get points flat false. mass bother won't. big impact. know, maybe so-called experts began pandemic telling people wear masks? changed mind couple months later? Going guess something it.  arriving several southern African countries quarantine amid warnings new Covid variant.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid said 12:00 GMT Friday six countries would added red list, flights temporarily banned.

One expert described variant, known B.1.1.529, ""the worst one we've seen far"", thought potential evade immunity.  hoping go andromeda strain route  thought came conclusion ago. It‚Äôs thousand now. tripled since last week.   unvaccinated people getting infected increases risk vaccinated people, takes health care resources, leads burnout healthcare workers. We're lockdown Norway (where live) either, health care system definitely strain again. Assuming variant disease burden delta infectious think system going overrun. Hopefully capacities better US Yeah, clearly idea you‚Äôre talking cares think? even getting 3 shots still wear mask (double-masked) &amp; still social distance.  radioactive ants also seemed go nowhere (hopefully literally) Fire him. level malignant narcissism something else. like UK govt move fast pleased have. says lot variant expertise genomic sequencing UK has. lost 2 IQ points reading stupid shit. Blatantly false. getting   Well mean we're locked Delta. least US.

The important question much evades immunity.... Natural vax. Well, start said even 60% people take vaccine, fine. goes show complaints highlighted OP. qualified estimates yet, course. winning Delta can't far that.

Delta reckoned R0 6 (e.g. recent study: winning variant seems 60 80% transmissible one before... R0 nine feasible.

But bit luck flaws raw data others mentioned making look worse is.

Levels immunity population outbreak happening also skew numbers too, course. It'll take another month two get vaguely accurate estimate. miss post OP stated pre-existing condition? won‚Äôt say I‚Äôm cautious person planet blanket advice could actually wind hurting conditions. specific variant 30 mutations spike protein. Beta three Delta two. 10 mutations part virus binds human body.

For low low price $500   Yes.  Okay? there‚Äôs massive surge happening right now. Vaccinated people still get sick even die, though obviously much, much less likely. even don‚Äôt get severely ill, there‚Äôs still chance lasting effects would want risk that?

I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt anything, cautious wear mask. got things still time. It‚Äôs cautious.

People always die. prevent excess death, you‚Äôd massive dick try. Especially reasoning selfishly want pretend everything fine. changed physical parts. still unclear effect changes transmissible able infect vaccinated people preliminary data correct wayyy fucked initial outbreak. lockdown-measures stop virus infectious. Let's hope less lethal least  family call order one, call back order second. call back order third spring 2020.   That‚Äôs necessarily true dealing new variant little known of. 10 ?

Am missing something. 10 cases, drama.  too!! won‚Äôt kids bc can‚Äôt stand thought ‚Äúneeded‚Äù people get home work. don‚Äôt know nurses moms it. There's definitely irony turns next bad one. :| Fingers crossed! majority chaps EU, removal travelling restrictions immense kick butt get jab. Now, Portugal started precedent many countries might follow. Yeah, locals seems alright, bad signal travel related matters. Generally bad deal, spending extra 70-80‚Ç¨ test, initial idea vaccination avoidance this, still fucking dissapoints. Understandable! I'm also sick people, 2 years later, completely clueless risks Covid.

[0.01% chance require hospitalization fully vaccinated full chance require hospitalization unvaccinated, [*vast* majority cases older people pre-existing   community choose wear much effective n95/ffp2 masks instead demanding everyone wear flimsy piece cloth. country likely going third lockdown tomorrow, I‚Äôm worrying lost wages read this. resilience fading, I‚Äôm sick üòû Take breath. comment amount mutations said nothing severity.  That's like opposite articles saying this. mean 10 cases identified. Get loo roll stocked up. boosters. draw line? 5 years, 10 years? eventually bite bite bullet accept people die. UK already enforcing quarantine SA response Ugh that‚Äôs ridiculous. Thanks clarifying exact shit hospital - understaffs purpose draining everybody works :/ really minor restrictions, comparing last year insanity. go football match 65k people test, compare 2020? Yes, annoying, massive improvement last year.

Compare restrictions restrictions unvaxxed Europe see massive difference get shamed public arbitrarily wearing maks certain settings, go cramped night clubs whatever want. right.  directive Federal prosecutors start prosecuting criminally using laws books.

Prior this, handled essentially civil matter recently fines increased.

The ""philosophy"" using criminal justice would significant deterrence would series high profile arrests person carted jail post bail. might even prison time even plea bargain.

I think specter prison deterrent vague idea fine   Get reusable ffp2/n95 mask want something actually significant benefit wearer. There's always potential leaks, e.g. certain traffic needed key services supply chains etc.

Adam Kucharski (of London School Hygiene Tropical Medicine) reckons early Chinese lockdowns stringent enough contain virus R 6 8: reckoned R0 6 (which Australia New Zealand defeated despite success previous variants).

If new one transmissible Delta transmissibility way excess limits.

Of course, R(t) lower R0, unless 100% immune evasive (very, unlikely... hopefully).  GOP Congress members, would wager wipe properly? butt dirty could whim? First time hearing saying, love it. ""Historically, F.A.A. handled cases civil penalties""

""the F.A.A. opted charge unruly passenger civil penalties""

I'm sure huge change make difference. mean...given little cloth masks wearer little risk children vaccinated....that pretty insane. It‚Äôs seems like raising fine disincentive shitty behavior isn‚Äôt going work unless put giant billboard every terminal.

SAY LOUDER NEED BETTER VACCINES!!!!   said ""everyone"" anti-vaxxers would harder time arguing vaccinated ones spreading virus. Can't that!  Wow, comments here....

The data clearly shows protection infection better two shots vaccines, especially Delta.  australia high vaccine compliance see common feature anti vaxxed usa covidiots rebel nature. sure education works. fight beast Per US law, citizens allowed entry. cornerstone citizenship. surprise really Europe back mess, summer pretty much everyone Europe acted like covid stopped caring.

In UK see loads old people charging round like invincible, people got heads vaccine means can't catch covid &amp; there's need careful.   back limited news sources get messages public.

Now gazillion places people get ""research"" (many minimal fact checking), suited fit readers pre-arranged biases.   It‚Äôs dick behavior‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs *normal* behavior me. I‚Äôm living normal life, like 2019. complicates South Africa low case vaccination numbers, new variant could filling void left low levels delta, ‚Äúoutcompeting‚Äù. don‚Äôt really know crossing fingers guess. Portugal vaccinated country Europe. Even compelling: Pay money opposing political party. Lockdowns unlikely January would wait till summer meaningful holiday. least towards end spring clearly concept physical science. Science reality series probabilistic events. Nothing impossible. Masks eliminate risk percentage. N95% reduce particle transmission 95%. reduced risk 1/20th. think wearing personally fitted N95, reduction much less. Likely 1/5 1/4 range. vaccines. Reduce additional 1/20th (95% effective). Add social distancing precautions lowered risk.

But risk never disappears, merely lowered acceptable level. average person, wearing mask getting vaccinated reduce risk \~1-2% risk unvaccinated/unmasked person. reduction acceptable you, that's fine. acceptable me.

I'm sure explaining this. Someone grasp probabilistic reality would realized saying previous post. Yeah shit especially new South African variant. trying enjoy time vaccine works get future. is. It‚Äôs believed fully crossed cattle disease rinderpest around 12th century. We‚Äôre talking novel virus outbreaks like early COVID way contagious medieval era cities knowledge germ theory. Must horrific. Love another person got sixty upvotes telling OP they're wrong ask politely explanation one sixty people cares explain. downvote smugly move on. /s :P Reduces sure, six months asymptomatic immunity wanes around 80% 25% so.

Denmark almost 80% total population vaccinated yet cases exponentially grown 10x past 6 weeks. separate? historical thing? Yeah understand story.  ""lost it"" because... ? Decided cut majority extended family won‚Äôt get vax someone gets covid every couple weeks. Idiots. 

Happy fucking Thanksgiving, everything still sucks. feel like they're trying protect unvaccinated punishing vaccinated people? I've done everything, I'm fully vaxed, still wear masks cause mandatory live feel safer seriously feels like ones keep getting punished anti vaxers, sister lives italy worried they'll close border even vaccinated people force lockdown, fair.  would say, trip kind annual trip means travel often, would go enjoy. bucket list, lifetime situation, would maybe wait things normalize truly enjoy it.

It‚Äôs matter personal preference point! yes europe hospitals overloaded unvaccinated stay home. 4th wave know that, point mutations concerning, level potential transmissibility combined spike mutations making concerning emergent variants we've seen. We've seen mutations spike mutations come go quickly little impact they're highly transmissible. moment, cause concern based spread they're seeing combined spike mutations... that's scientists alarmed since Delta suddenly alarmed.  I'm fully vaccinated, point, pray avoid Covid anti viral drugs proven safe effective available every corner pharmacy. Time hire former prison inmate firefighters. üëç served time already training experience. Would awesome give opportunity full-time career! Thats fair spose. probably make things timed ban.  go read studies it. fuck wrong you? advocating murdering petty criminals without due process. want give flight attendants power commit extra judicial murder. That's advocating. Fuck that. hope FDA agrees death long term sickness puts never plausible scenario. Severely enough prevent spread virus, hoped. work without early widespread compliance. Otherwise temporarily protecting people complied. Super variant makes sound scary,

this scary. current vaccines monoclonal abs highly reduced effectiveness this, probably worse Beta variant. One main targets RBD RBD significantly different original strain Delta.   Seriously sick people pretending locked ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù live lives.

Nothing fucking closed. I‚Äôve gone plenty events year lined up. toss mask good time.

Are masks annoying? glasses wearer, that‚Äôs big yes, it‚Äôs end world. global pandemic people spreading covid giant Macy's ad? hear you, I‚Äôm talking federal. take year solicitation mature enough bid on. comes bid evaluation process. Then, often, several legal protests award. that‚Äôs done contractors start process product development. Everything subsequent usually mired agency politics unqualified leadership. Interesting, thought angle. part ssi index something though? Who's debating UK policy? know NY times thinks UK policy. They've repeated again. Even article, things looking better done while, still know think UK policy. seem suggest Neil Ferguson mentioning may reaching herd immunity may touch raw nerve. Why? hard summer exactly reason. woods yet, better place time many countries. always get Sridhar say NYT wants hear......  No. Think second. asshole flight comparable stranding someone foreign country citizenship. people would able make back ok people would become refugees. That's really shitty reason make people refugees. ... new government wont constituted another \~ 2 weeks. whole transition really unhelpful. Anyways... mandate. thread wrong explain why. see people still advocating masks worn every single time want go anything, asinine stupid. People maliciously compliant masks best beginning told taking every single necessary action mitigate basically start over, 2 years effectively wasted. That's going fly everyone, going help vaccine rollout. people champions masks need step high horse take look bigger picture, infectious disease really much make everyone survive healthy, going deaths sickness going away, probably forever. beginning pandemic watched people get outright tackled held trying step Walmart, somehow perceive *everyone* virus likes spread asymptomatically means *everyone* spread it. created culture fear terror history tells us eventually boiling point. needs change, want wear mask that's fine, neighbor want fine, get vaccinated, advocate others get vaccinated, love God, relax. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone United States America!

This second consecutive year spending Thanksgiving family (this time, due personal issues, COVID-19).  everyone wearing masks would transmissions, simple. Sad simple fact beyond you. Plus people willing shut down, mask without in-person stuff 3-6 months. Sports, theater, restaurants, visiting family. government support that. Massive fatigue measures ending deep support kicked year.  already clarified point. serious. However, Merck Pfizer anti-viral pills dependent antibodies. need approved deployed ASAP. false sense security ‚Ä¶ vaccinated think they're invincible.  Masking like wearing pants. face used verbal non-verbal communication highly sensitive touch. Masks, me, highly uncomfortable make talking people pain ass. still don‚Äôt get people say ‚Äúoh masks big deal‚Äù. I‚Äôm wearing one comply law. ""Delta exception."" know refuse ever fly Delta charged without consent callous resolving it. false sense security significant portion population unvaccinated?  everyone think visiting family thanksgiving vaccinated vaccinated? family members it‚Äôs put tough place. Skipped thanksgiving Christmas last year I‚Äôd rather don‚Äôt want around unvaccinated people. put mask quiet flight. hard do. scientists concerned outside spike protein mutations.

Those spike protein mutations make vaccines infection acquired immunity much less effective.

If spreads like Delta antibody evasion, vaccines monoclonals much less effective. australia allowed leave country desire moment. yes sick lockdown living like used time way would travel usa many crazies listening health advice. stage dead tourism usa resume Great, really mean great; assholes small metal tube cannot exit just...assholes need pay.

Otherwise, gonna get insurrectionists seditious Presidents DoJ?

This great, reaaaaaaaaally smacks candy-for-the-masses approach (a timely distraction).  I‚Äôm jabbed boosted - I‚Äôve done part. I‚Äôm done waiting mouth breathers catch up. keeps trying put toothpaste back tube realize they‚Äôve squeezed much out. They‚Äôve lost credibility werent already this? We‚Äôre literally never going ‚Äúend‚Äù this. People need wake understand need learn navigate life this.  going do, walk?

Explaining aggrieved recourse adds OP's point though. mean nextstrain data: 

the wave started June. According official data started took 2 months get big, stalled september, grows following 2 months till today. basically right, wave took longer grow expected (the alpha wave took like 1.5 months noticed start big). stalled, probably september kinda Thats wrong actually. Masks vaccines completely eliminate risk. example, vaccinated young adult longer risk. Donald you? don‚Äôt care. think invincible vaccinated. vaccinated don‚Äôt think invincible. mention threat mutations, especially current one Africa.  enjoy Europeans tryin act like HSR makes sense america That‚Äôs well good, hospitals overwhelmed, treatable medical emergency, you‚Äôll affected too. don‚Äôt worry getting potential breakthrough case? think unrulyness travelers US exacerbated culture TSA contributes contributed stress level passengers. traveled many countries around world, experience traveling US airport distinctly different - whereas TSA-equvalents countries calmly empatheticaly guide passengers security process, advising people prepare scan, talking individuals need take shoes off, speaking bag searched, US, procedure noticeably different much TSA shouts people, engages individuals TSA officer thinks stupid, makes whole experience feel though going prison checkpoint. 

Am saying TSA hold blame? ... engage passengers definitely contributes emotions lead poor passenger behavior. telling unruly passenger behavior seems distinctly American phenomenon. Thank you! exactly feel. double jabbed don‚Äôt feel entitlement whatever vaxxed. pandemic *not* over.  Spanish flu killed disproportionately young people nature virus immune system turn itself. Thise strong immune systems severe reactions: young. old threatened, shut society down. Fuck future current youth apparently. Ah yes, despise habeas corpus. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è things scare went social media hunt saw - idea ever came strain, got everyone scared presumably amounted much. Botswana SA around 20% population vaccinated. That‚Äôs lot unvaccinated people get infections. Also proves highly fatal presumably similar fate OG SARS. 

This anecdotal helped take deep breath‚Ä¶for least. sounds like dick behavior‚Ä¶you literally flaunting that. üôÑ LOL user name checks out, take upvote  Fingers crossed. feel like I'd prefer Pfizer kids. Moderna seems one likely hit hard immune response, fun toddler... Seems like happened earlier, then? YES!! Thank you! seen anything they‚Äôve gotten ill, severity illness? Misinformation sort implies maliciousness‚Ä¶. bad information early pandemic, based information available.  still reduce average lifespan  things ""open"" mean they're safe.

You fuck without condom too. always safe so. True AZ vax rejected Africa since research, say flawed, showed AZ ineffective variant prevalent Africa back  60%? That's heard. said 75%, said 80%. even said 60%, means underestimated virus, reason more, less. people starving lockdown, room right now?  huge backlog reported day. Also SA hit hard Delta also 23.5% residents fully vaccinated. won't. corporations would throw fit can't make money.  Thanksgiving one bitter irony. Almost family supposed meet today fully vaccinated least two doses, uncle contracted (thankfully non-COVID) pneumonia hospital, mother recovering bad cold, postponing holiday. 

I wish everyone elsewhere happy, safe Thanksgiving. Hopefully quite big rise COVID cases (or deaths least) last year. Swedish British vaccine French boss AZ postures may led effective immunisation. possible, however research suggests significantly less effective German US vaccines think hospitalisations important since hospital full COVID patients isn‚Äôt gonna good. seems third jabs pretty key long term prevention considered baseline requirement. look data overall it‚Äôs hard argue vaccines aren‚Äôt working. effed reading two cases Hong Kong that's brain produced. I've since edited post. American Samoa. bad let in. cares thinks anymore. vaccinated live life, need accept fact get mild breakthrough point coming weeks/months/years. best!! Important thing death rate - infecting mild otherwise, nothing panic.

In fact, infectious delta lot less deadly - probably even better spread delta. variant (B.1.1.529) detected normal qPCR due deletion Spike position 69-70 (like Alpha), make easy world track it. estimate 90% cases Gauteng (at least 1000 day variant, due qPCR proxy testing)""*

Well, that's something better. saying day 1, one safe everyone safe.

But profit pharma government rather send charity vaccines poor countries allowing mass produce distribute vaccine prevent spreading creating new deadly strains comes back hurt us like case.


It time push removing patent vaccines focus preventing become like contagious movie rerun. Agreed. believe older people people health risks related covid get vaccine, healthy people younger people get it, still can. vaccinated still cautious sanitary around people public.  mean people? Countries starting travel ban, think scientists missing backlog?    [this wrong? What‚Äôs real percentage then? show studies peer reviewed proved masks nothing? know this: masks slow spread COVID flu real world countries people irrational fear masks. care want use mask entire life?  Hong Kong enter conversation?  SA Health department said erroneous data update last week overstating cases.  might little less immune response, maybe *ideal*, vaccine still work.

People oral corticosteroids still get vaccinated. still helps. Screw off, nobody wants lockdowns.  ten cited UK. South Africa excellent sequence capability probably ones pick up. say known uk cases could almost take grim comfort authorities admit modern medicine completely powerless new variant lockdowns, mask mandates social distancing draw inevitable calamity long painfully possible. I'm things now, changes game point even matter...


Might well devolve hedonism debauchery doomsday approaches know? Uhhh‚Ä¶the things discuss post certainly make severity. would ‚ÄúICUs overflowing‚Äù ‚Äúhundreds thousands deaths‚Äù mild variant terms severity..   work forced us get vaccinated, fine me, hypocritical made come week roommate LIVE got covid coworkers got work 8 hours day made us still come in. long they're making money, care.   FLIGHTS SOUTH AFRICA/BOTSWANA/HONG KONG ASAP!

As delta, second find it, spread worldwide important question next pertinent one. idea actual severity strain. ‚ÄúSuper variant‚Äù scare tactic term, plain simple. could ‚Äúsavior variant‚Äù contagious minimally severe terms symptoms/health impact already covid, got vaccinated got also symptomatic? Wow I‚Äôve never heard course infections. Last checked vaccine boosted immunity natural infection strongest they‚Äôve seen. Crazy would get again. Moderna larger dose Pfizer (for adults). adjusting dose kids, make smaller. Pfizer age 5-11 vaccine already 1/3 dose adult Pfizer. Yea mutation do? Makes virus spread survive longer population. 

If doesn't, virus spread cause Delta. definitely showing problem already would burned out. 

The wording bit saying ""number"", know number mutations gonna bad ones circulates, inevitable. That's say high number means bad mutations. 

They definitely talking mutations make spread. info released soon, expect. one, welcome society redditors self-select social situations. makes everyones lives better. Time finally update vaccines STILL first version covid reason? create harmless COVID-19 lab

That's called vaccine Exactly thought. list ranking sort thing? country?  ‚ÄúSpike protein B.1.1.529 dramatically different‚Äù
 
Since vaccine target spike, changes said spike may make vaccines less effective. could make vaccinated people vulnerable, hence virus may transmittable

Have said would surprise uk governments playing politics theatre. Still got far, better play little safe. Snakes ladders get tiresome 2 years Download NYCCOVIDSAFE app. lets conveniently take photos vaccine card ID easily switch them, staff restaurants, etc. accustomed dealing it.

I still recommend carrying physical ID (but vaccine card). couple places wanted see physical ID age verification purposes. People starving next variant support need total lockdown, matter social, economical mental health toll takes society  concerning new variant coronavirus, whose mutations evidence ‚Äúbig jump evolution,‚Äù driving spike new Covid-19 infections South Africa, scientists said far, 22 positive cases identified South Africa, according South Africa‚Äôs National Institute Communicable Diseases.

So, 22 cases considered ‚Äúdriving spike?‚Äù Maybe information aren‚Äôt including? 

Also later new variant largely detected among young people, cohort also lowest vaccination rate South Africa. quarter ages 18 34 vaccinated, said Dr. Joe Phaahla, country‚Äôs minister health.

Wouldn‚Äôt indicate might escaping vaccine induced immunity? detected age groups, sure. course, working small sample sets here. 22 cases South Africa, time tell. what? Lockdowns?  certain transplant drugs unable vaccinate.   prevent thing trying last year half. Folks understandably skeptical, one *does* sound like potential concern.

Dr. Christina Pagel, Univ College shutting people's ability make living whim. Fucking criminal. success SARS2 due proteins contributing kill disabling immune system. would less efficient replaced disabled. There's good chance infected already felt side effects fully vaccinated. :) Ireland percentage adults. Portugal much older population.  Haha, worries man. Yep. global already. 1 flight (hong kong) every flight country since. 

So spreads even faster Delta‚Ä¶ reached 75% already article says cases UK yet, one differs: normally well informed health authorities South Africa? 

Ignorance confused discernment. Well, spreads easily like Delta part world least continental dominance, disappears means Delta outcompeted another one. late Well carrot don‚Äôt die get covid? still gotta explain almost two years in. get fewer restrictions motivate that‚Äôs goal vaccine. It‚Äôs don‚Äôt die.  ‚ÄúWe act like Europe much worse, we‚Äôve accepted high death toll higher infection rates longer,‚Äù Professor Sridhar said. That's question doctor evidence dampens immune response covid People already forgo masks live. restrictions none considered. taken personal responsibility safety. far I've regrets. far know, given anyone coronavirus. Israel make vaccines. could buy extra Pfizer/Moderna vaccines use boosters, can't buy variant-based vaccines nobody making yet. call hoe? I'll know hoe. slut, thank much! know there's significant number mutations, perhaps double number mutations seen Delta variant,"" Health Secretary Sajid Javid told would suggest may well transmissible current vaccines may well less effective.""

Not understanding amount mutations would ‚Äúsuggest‚Äù it‚Äôs transmissible. Since number mutations suggest anything viruses ability transmit evade immunity? aren‚Äôt saying particular mutations lend conclusion, saying number mutations does. mutations mean vaccine evasion we're almost back square 1. 'severity'. overflowing ICUs, hundreds thousands dying dying lack access emergency/cancer/life prolonging treatments hospitals swamped covid again. Even low % death/covid critial overwhelmed every single hospital world. Grimly, increase severity would almost preferable someones dies something rapidly - they're less likely pass around, resulting virus essentially burning way quicker less spread actually easily contained/controlled.  taking seriously immediately mean locking travel spread everywhere time know it?

Do part, enjoy life.  UK 4 times many test per week, 7 times. (Or 5 times, adjusted population size.)

And last heard PCR positivity rate UK 10%? 
But someone told no-one knows make numbers anymore. argument goes last year, people PCR test suspected Covid, positivity-rate showed bad situation country real terms. Now, people UK lots lots LFTs, positive turn around PCR confirmation; means sample base PCR tests whole entirely skewed. sure assessment correct. why? seems like solid point, I'm sure downvoted. guess concern ‚â† inherent danger necessarily. going get everyone eventually, do? Thanks  Tell entitled without telling entitled. Yeah got shit   basing where? Saying enough people quarantine mask seriously enough?

 situation different country, state, city town. live Jersey 1 densest states US even wanted ignore quarantine literally nothing open. Parks gyms closed, in-door dining closed, traffic reduced mere trickle happen stores narrowed hours severely (the ones close) went year Everyone wearing mask 2020. also allowed public gatherings quite enforced. 

Some highly vaccinated areas semi-lockdown still dealing high cases, unvaxxed, mostly open areas fine. can't say 1 size fits statements "" enough x"" without little information. way lower vs number cases, would accurate. What‚Äôs goal here? comment supposed make suddenly love masks? Maybe make even ridiculous comparison might start come around. Holding people accountable actions. concept.

If flights poor people color they'd held accountable even anything. Seeing many people thread say ""done taking precautions"" ""need get back life"". sounds like someone saying ""im done wearing seatbelt, while, never got hurt, need anymore"".

To me, sounds ignorant selfish. virus becomes significantly lesser threat society.

Pandemics last forever. Spanish Flu didn‚Äôt last forever.  Smokers do.  may completely prevent infection spread virus, drastically lower chances either happening. thing is, covid going away. point would argue vaccinated people stop social distancing? Genuinely curious. diagnosed autopsy. Good, hoping implicit /s.

Yep. People learn. two things anyone do. place business doesn‚Äôt require masks don‚Äôt go there. want stay removed people, socially distance. Society set don‚Äôt interact anyone. That‚Äôs choice. 

100 years ago would harder socially distance things like shopping etc. today. One mindful like. Exactly got booster 3 weeks ago. takes idiot see gonna surge, dont even bother listening ththe cdc / fda anymore, slow act. BS. anyone actually give shit say anymore? gave listening said proof COVID transmissible‚Ä¶ cases Italy already. know right? much sleep fill brows since hair straightener died ceeping hair curly. God damn, time increase.  social life diminish spread covid. Meet outdoors, space slightly apart, fine. 

Its all-or-nothing thing. mean, estimate population growth, like denominador id number ten years ago I've wearing mask TWO YEARS. I'm tired part see Karens Kyles throw temper tantrums like little toddlers asked little human compassion. I'm tires part losing.  Wrong. Masking distancing reduce spread, hospitals get overwhelmed. Vaccination makes hospitalization death much less likely. absolutely matters. Always nice trash takes out.

But *national* story? Giving losers media coverage beyond sphere gives narrative power make situation worse. It‚Äôs different fully vaccinated tetanus keeping dog cat vaccinated rabies. It‚Äôs timetable that‚Äôs different right there‚Äôs good possibility changing. hoped could achieve herd immunity. hoped vaccines would provide ""sterilizing immunity"". look like either correct, current vaccines. Respiratory viruses mutate lot tough. 

You work find out. That's way science works.  put life hold? 

Honestly, sound privileged whining putting certain parts life countries access medicine dying covid. present compelling argument. /s non-hysteria report you, headline ""scary"" you... people said delta first detected high number clusters    can't exhausted more? chipper hopeful? No. I'm tired. I'm exhausted. everything right, certain subset people PART, getting WORSE. no, get say anything. 

I'm tired. relatives loony vaccines politics, they're genuinely nice people we've wonderful meals many years, without politics much mentioned. Lots people make poor decisions. make bad people. I'm sure suggesting. saying stay home holidays year children cannot get vaccinated yet?

I've followed every protocol, taken every precaution, listened advice public health experts nearly 20 months now. stayed basically isolated entire year. see friends family. got vaccine. got booster. still wear mask public. That's it. do? can't stop Covid. here. Time learn live it.

I understand want protect children hopefully vaccine approved newborns sooner later. small child want take extra precautions that's great. There's much personally. still wear mask public, still follow whatever local guidelines restrictions are, I'll continue get vaccines tell get another shot. need go back living life learning accept Covid stay. Trump right. test pandemic. cut funding testing strategy, less cases, less pandemic.  NYC also widely available testing. tents street walk get test day. sniffle, worried exposure work person? Get test. assessment getting vaccinated continuing mask still got Covid. So, may something. Hi, ‚Äòreality‚Äô guy here. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated well wasn‚Äôt clear. also wear mask indoors socially distance fully vaccinated colleagues friends. I‚Äôll/we‚Äôll probably get mildly sick I/we get infected, I/we may infect others I/we still care good society general. vaccinated make authority ‚Äòdeserves‚Äô live lives deserves stay locked up. Vaccines alone enough right now. Oh, car accidents aren‚Äôt contagious. What‚Äôs chances dying vaccinated person 65? Get grip. assault punishable imprisonment? lmao, people stupid before,maybe

However would said way show stupid are, although surprise average human stupid  crybabies refuse change behavior. ""I make assessments"" sounds like unvaccinated say. 

Choosing get vaccine pretend immune going negate fact still catch spread Covid, hence need continue wearing masks social distancing. 

I get it. Life different easy blame get vaccine! helping stop spread pretend vaccine that's needed. Less two years. 

It took awhile covid spread country, dealing different timelines. bad thing mutations make likely virus escape immune system's defenses? spells bad news everyone including vaccinated, it?
If Im missing something please let know. see would agree 1) accurate present table relevant tax codes 2) didn‚Äôt use superfluous title used 3) didn‚Äôt seem take away directly negative wrong information attempted spread online problem running patience virus never runs patience.

I'm saying listen them. Like said, find doctor trust use them. I'm saying talk smack decisions pretend like qualified make anywhere near level education also possibly even amount information do. mean, 2016 wasn‚Äôt indicator‚Ä¶

Or‚Ä¶ could listen health authorities whatever makes feel good. realize many overpopulated areas asia wearing masks public decades, right?

Good show privileged need one.  parents share level concern? boosted?

Personally, risk tolerances puts sharing time friends/family losing taste. That's something I'm willing risk. virologists South Africa raised alarm new Covid-19 variant first detected Botswana, found heavy presence South B.1.1.529, Imperial College London virologist Tom Peacock highlighted new variant¬†contains high number mutations, including 30 spike raised concerns may resistant immune cells attack virus, potentially Department Health, conjunction National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), held media briefing Thursday regarding latest data gathered new panel indicated early signs show infections new variant increased rapidly Gauteng. According Tulio de Oliveira, KRISP director University KwaZulu-Natal, likely already present Anne von Gottberg National Institute Communicable Diseases (NICD), 100 genomes variant identified South Africa.  Viruses don‚Äôt want anything don‚Äôt regard suspicion level host.

This anthropomorphization part stunningly unprofessional, especially obscures important facts.  eugenics then? Again, nothing misinformation robustly explained article. Leadership  forgot important fact: Spain‚Äôs vaccination rate much higher Austria‚Äôs. better situation, even case numbers. Already 77 cases confirmed mostly one city, going up. Remenbering mutation first detected last month.

Source:  agree, also think people fully vaccinated responsible two years likely continue cautious. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs people remain unvaccinated lie continue circulate mask heeding recommendations. Haha, yeah specific smell awful non coffee drinker lmao find ""terrible"" WHO's handling pandemic? believe that, given limited power, performed pretty well. Yeah, see that's fourth wave started. Cases significantly declining CDC issued updated guidelines mask wearing ""if vaccinated need wear mask"". think May. month later fourth wave surged, despite updated guidelines yet recommending vaccinated people wear masks settings two months prior told longer to. late people took masks putting back ever again.

It completely irresponsible move CDC could easily predicted outcome would result in. promoted irresponsible behavior knew safe. would fourth wave unexpected? People largely ignoring masking inside, gathering unvaccinated family members, going dining indoors poor ventilation‚Ä¶these increase spread. Every time weather shifts people go indoors heat/air conditioning get outbreaks like clockwork.     answer fine jail time, lifetime ban commercial aircraft. Fines make punishment poor putting fewer people jail.

Your permanently fly list.  Good point people countries vaccines available on-demand months still obligation inconvenience protect people immunocompromised, younglings, elderly.

Erm, don't. months clubs full every week concerts resumed usual. know I've there. Living normal life since summer terrible, please feel sorry too. Herd immunity goal long time. additional vaccinated people still help reduce infection rates hospitalization rates. fair, initially reduce transmission virus well. 

what massive faillure delta strain 

Although wonder reduce transmissiion Well yes, almost articles misrepresent factual information factual information presentation issue, table include tax brackets says &lt;75000 nothing &lt;0% taxes paid people bracket. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs misinformation. That‚Äôs get people like guy think poor people aren‚Äôt paying taxes UK testing Europe long shot makes us look worse apparently Germany, Belgium NL getting fucked stable Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society‚Äôs studies show (blood cancer patients survivors) don‚Äôt increased adverse effects vaccines. recommend vaccination even chemo. likely studies specific cancer could locate national org medical team. One known issues reduced/no antibody production it‚Äôs typically issue blood cancer (or history), specific medications post stem cell transplant.  illegal assault anyone decades ago. Whether felony charge depends severity assault conditions. Touching someone opposed hitting someone, saying inappropriate things opposed shouting spitting someone, on. actual point here? Intuitively makes sense, study found.

Turns out, old really expensive things stops old save money. Actually Florida pretty good covid right now. problem spots Michigan Pennsylvania. mistake. Figure 1, vaccination rate persons years old. realize that‚Äôs headline article? OP didn‚Äôt create tittle own. some. Fines really fees excuse illegal actions rich enough.  guess keep fingers crossed hooe finally one that's much contagious far less severe. gotta eventually get lucky mutation like hopefully think NZ government extended could leave. 

My mates brother came back NZ covid restrictions back UK Uh...yeah....isn't illegal public nuisance, assault, attack, endanger others? Enough tolerating insane behavior already. Austria free PCR at-home test kits, drop many supermarkets gas stations get results lab 24 hours (well, better regions better others).

The cost government pays per PCR test \~8.50 Euro, thanks smart use pooling    Yeah, wtf? even tried broadcast virus airborne, let alone come plans keep people safe airborne transmission mind. they're suggesting allow children become infected based upon... most, what, nanosecond sort data gathering? thanks, seriously suspect. professional wrestler whose gimmick time maniac. paying much attention WHO, USA, think attributing way much malice (or stupidity) comments taken context, judging current knowledge (in August, much less info need boosters).

The way comes across me, arguing concentrating vaccinating everybody world first, worry boosters, seems reasonable me, even now, perspective 'what good world' rather 'what best USA'. then, reporters choose juicier bits :) Deaths vaccination status, England guys, definitely pro-vaxx. wondering explain according UK data present link above, death rate causes (not Covid-19 related; per 100.000 people) population aged 10-59 higher vaccinated people unvaccinated. See Table 4 .xls file.  


Any idea explain that? anti-vaxx friend presented unable explain. data look would expect - vaxxed people lower death rates, especially Covid-19 related. think sure thing yet, SA public health briefing, variant outbreaks, community spread.  
It 80% Guateng's recent cases. 
Guateng reported 300 daily cases COVID week ago, 1000 recent day. 

It evidence transmissible, think part health authorities scientists rushing placing high priority it. argument point probably like ""low sample size""  
If Guateng tripling week repeatable, guess wait super long see outbreaks happening areas. That's wrong. know they've tried brining light body. Poland decided basically restrictions. due anti-everything population want wear masks, get vaccinated, close type business. country makes big deal deaths like 10 coal miners mine plane crash Smolensk mind 400+ daily deaths COVID. like finishing course antibiotics feel better day five ten.   Tbh, estimates put number dead 1 million already, due undercounting. see US crossing ""official"" 1 mil dead threshold end winter, like saying. likely hit 2k day dead end December would guess. anyone gone back tallied excess deaths like November 2019 like March 2020? COVID sure spreading tests anything.  It‚Äôs worth noting 10 cases far. really don‚Äôt know anything mutations mean. countries tried claim marathon 24 miles. doesn‚Äôt work way. US lost lives COVID year last


... proportion lives lost **un**vaccinated?

The article say. simple google search brings US CDC homepage easy (for me, guess?) understand chart demonstrating **un**vaccinated US citizens 14x higher chance dying COVID vaccinated **un**vaccinated 5.8x greater risk showing symptoms vaccinated. April 4th - Oct 2nd, compare numbers charts show similar results.  literally never understood people got idea fully vaccinated meant didn‚Äôt wear mask. you‚Äôre fully vaccinated can‚Äôt still carry virus asymptomatic? it‚Äôs even harder trace Covid, would risk spreading others still. wear mask. wear one everyday work. aren‚Äôt mandatory you‚Äôre vaccinated. haven‚Äôt taken mask off. wear everyday. point know I‚Äôll get take someday, it‚Äôs time yet. Mutations alone mean immune system harder time recognizing virus. *How much* harder, that's another story course.

But generally speaking, might grounds virus like survive. Delta's main trick higher transmissibility, worked great time, still works. However, people get vaccinated acquire immunity naturally, next useful trick might try escape acquired immunity. might evolutionary pressure type strain survive coming times pandemic. Covid already contagious enough symptoms mild. , luck could bring mutation highly contagious weak Talk many Americans, they'll say ""who?"" Maybe stated area infested right now. worse time pandemic. month summer wear mask. I'm point wear mask every time go out. big deal me. Saves time makeup.  I‚Äôve fully vaccinated since early January 2021, people weren‚Äôt vaccinated months Okay, never know people complaining wearing N95 agree really gets bad hours. 

Cloth masks comparison barely notice difference. Honestly, I‚Äôm sure really matters, least anymore. Recent report canadas largest province (14m ppl) shows 91% new cases unvaccinated 9 total cases breakthrough COVID happened people age 60. don‚Äôt think warrants massive change approach Canadians. course, higher risk, go it, that‚Äôs article discussing. worth, husband got boosters bad reactions all. completely agree done sooner though. hope finals go well. August 21 October 27 Germany, vaccination rate increased 67% 84%.

How vaccination rate still 70% November? Surely realize pandemics don‚Äôt last forever, right?

The Spanish Flu ended 100 years ago. outcompete Delta two questions 
1. result less severe symptoms? Death? 
2. current batch vaccines work it? possible one unusual mutations could one makes even contagious delta giving edge also much less severe like one found UK recently? well actually beneficial viruses become less severe. People become mildly ill virus likely go life usual come contact people. 

If someone becomes bedridden dies, likely spread virus many others. own. gives shit. fully vaxed boosted getting younger  Surely realise virus around rest life, ok die? nothing's going change. said initially, article actually quite accurate.  I‚Äôd like go ‚Äúdead end‚Äù opinion virus long way go it‚Äôs controlled point yearly vaccinations like flu. Ugh. I'm tired wearing work behind plexiglass screen least 6 feet coworker. enforced soldiers Australia? lockdowns aus work, kept bay long time unfortunately strains infectious got people tried leave quarantine accident. states like NSW 92% eligible pop vaccinated. everyone world followed proper medical advice turned weird conspiracy political bullshit would lot better.  Yep, mutations basically roll dice like literal rng, could min max certain traits making virus deadly, hinder efficacy/mortality/infectivity.

The uncertainty definitely little scary. Around 300 daily cases Guateng week ago, around 1000 yesterday. region said 80% cases sampled B.1.1.529 

I guess see designation variant concern rushed. really kind growth advantage, would bigger step Delta Delta Alpha... 

Hoping behavior get repeated areas sure... made available counter, many people, especially marginalized people, going die unnecessarily. Health advocates must push prescription-free access. mean CDC director appointed president position susceptible political interference appointed position. understand people think health-related government agencies run bureaucrats. Sure, staff works earned way director orders politically-motivated changes, either fall line find job somewhere else. anyone watched it, it‚Äôs saying government trying make effective masks (eg N95s) accessible high risk. don‚Äôt need get new masks. Science told vaccine would prevent need this. Don‚Äôt fret! It‚Äôs coming America soon enough.

Was that... 1988 Eddie Murphy movie reference?

On serious note, others pointed thread, monitoring new variant confirmed whether additional mutations cause concern are, someone eloquently put ""an evolutionary dead end"". Sorry, trying invalidate feelings. People family testing based risk infectious seeing vulnerable members. Vaccinated 20 something‚Äôs cousins hanging out? tests. 

Going see grandma? Tested. Going see family member refuses vaccine? They‚Äôre getting tested. latest variant media fear monger over.

Yup. sounds awful lot like panic media tried push Lambda Mu, promptly disappeared face earth. \~100 cases anywhere near enough cause concern, especially country 24% vaccination rate. good book  looking pretty grim. terms morbidity low vaccinated countries screwed spreads. Highly vaccinated countries boosters probably ok still wave might need restrictions. Get booster you‚Äôre offered ASAP. older variants way extinction vaccination alone. get new surges vaccines dropped effectiveness Alpha. Delta.

Likewise idea Delta go way Alpha due population immunity, replaced something else, somehow become endemic even though zero measurable reinfections 18 months covid. 

But central point incontrovertible. Three doses enough population end Delta pandemic. Keep commenting, enjoy downvoting shit. deboonked. lot countries 90%+ vaxx rate coof incidence spike high (gibraltar, ireland example) Honestly, outside certain groups elderly, efficacy waning enormously severe disease. 

Not that's gonna make safer, booster certainly cuts margins, feel we've somehow convinced vaccinated vaccines keeping safe unvaccinated there's point getting first place.  Russia way democratic country evolving faster goddamned pokemon.

Lmfo ok laughing. üòÇ I‚Äôve shit day (planned get booster, feel sick got tested instead), comment days highlight   [Most breakthrough cases elderly receive booster Curtains would nice wouldn‚Äôt it? Perhaps ventilated therefore unconscious, though seem side don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs case Europe someone explain mechanism new covid anti viral pills effective sorts variants variant specific? Bracing? wife NP ER. working 20hr shifts last 3months. Every. Single. One. Unvaccinated third dose. clearly followed science, Delta quickly overwhelm level vaccination we'd suppressing pandemic time, also saw efficacy even older variants lowering time vaccination. case two doses going forever protective even pre-delta covid. We're going dealing covid forever. Keep boosters keep protected greatest degree possible. single source, single proof also please give better one believe valuable opinion. basically new variation evades Antivax arguments getting vaccinated. Sweet. speak antibodies right pretty normal protective antibodies decrease time vaccination infection body want waste ressources create antibodies might needed reproduce quickly case infection cellular immunity.

Well, yes no. illness vaccination different, necessarily unusual durable circulating antibody response (which decreases slowly time), addition memory B cells. often also used proxy protection established diseases data available. example, MMR titers direct measure circulating antibodies years even decades vaccination, generally established protective ranges. think people see someone really close die go really rough case finally hit home them. It‚Äôs game anymore. Wait minute thought Delta woman. Damn catfish again!   selfishness carelessness others truly impacting lives children. disgusting. Depends definition wave, people count uptrend cases following downtrend. High tide ocean distinct waves, single low tide wave lasted 12 hours. perverse way, executive right. Ban WFH force spouse make sacrifices workplace deal childcare issues. symptoms booster besides normal sore arm. Socializing way overrated; prefer avoid people anyways. 200 million haven't, majority children, right?

I agree concept previous infection counting immunity for, say, 6 months orx whatever... problem is- prove it? Exactly. It‚Äôs time stop infected/death updates, etc. 

No one cares. It‚Äôs stay. It‚Äôs never, ever going away. Leper colonies. like old days.  100%.

My father law died COVID mid-September single person ""Celebration Life"" vaccinated give shit - refused wear masks well. stayed home protect unvaccinated 5 yr old. got booster end September (severe asthma) husband fully vaccinated April.

3 weeks ago, husband brought COVID home dining restaurant Manhattan colleague - first person meeting 20 months.

To say life turned upside putting lightly. son get COVID made single mom virtual school hell husband isolated bedroom provide everything needed via drop offs entire time isolation. really scared sickest ever seen son even noticed. 

People get vaccinated give shit. mother law father law never even properly isolated FIL ended hospital. Even died MIL still refusing get vaccinated believes can't get sick again.

We're living divided country. I‚Äôm except quickly part. underlying mRNA technology development decades finally first use real world. gym? Yes. heat? Yes. 8 hours straight? Yes. Moderna still protection decay time, bad pfizer. idea long boosters good for.

I think telling enough they're making qualifications boosters. would 100% get booster moderna 6 months ago. wait cases start rising, could late even part cause. Right nearly impossible get appointment booster area: almost everything booked rest year. Fortunately already got mine, want dealing kind issue.

Get boosted! Shot. Didn‚Äôt get frosty sadly yesterday. eat snickers though drank Gatorade. [One ended Alpha pandemic, clear [very early 2 doses cut delta. idea would take end Delta penademic, countries started it.

Get third dose.  shuts cells‚Äô nuclei regulating gene expression, aka causes cells shut down. It‚Äôs pharmaceutical equivalent raising body temp 107*F combat virus; yes, virus may able replicate, it‚Äôs worth sacrificing host (e.g. blindness, organ failure). taking preventatively even dumb you‚Äôre damaging cells they‚Äôve even exposed threat you‚Äôre trying combat. J&amp;J probably suffered well two doses it‚Äôs long slow ramp (such point 14 days really shouldn‚Äôt considered fully vaccinated least 28). Even government‚Äôs suggestion booster really doesn‚Äôt coincide J&amp;J‚Äôs trials seem indicate waiting 6 months ideal time boost (I think gave like 14 times antibodies suggested 2 months gave like 5).

IIRC, particular concerns two shot course J&amp;J body develop independent immune response viral vector used. might wait several months die prevent body essentially neutralizing second shot immediately code desired proteins. booster 4-6 months may timing would used two shot series anyways. Also, big pitch J&amp;J mRNA jabs single shot, useful remote transient communities might low opportunity adherence follow-up shot. It‚Äôs definitely twilight zone weird. tried encourage brother take vaccine, claimed VACCINE killed 2 people knew personally. can‚Äôt sane discussion people aren‚Äôt sane. variant vaccine specifically designed work natural immunity won't. Antivax community going get hammered gets going. Yes.
Its thing. [This monthly deaths part would put ~150k deaths Jan+Feb (roughly 20% deaths-to-date 2021). I'm worried I'm vaccinated long virus permeates it'll mutate vaccines mean shit. 100% two-dose vaccinated Gibraltar? thought two doses, sufficient level, would end it. didn't. Efficacy faded far, far quickly. Expecting third dose end nothing wishful thinking. could happen, looking realm hoping, following solid science. Annoying US classified single region waves highly regional. US South already wave hitting upper Midwest now. gets higher populated media centers like NYC LA later year, media frame apocalypse. Fuck. Fuck. mf evolving faster goddamned pokemon.  depressing outlook go vaccine supply point:

Vaccine availability really open adults ~April year. able get first shot mid April relatively early among age cohort friends different states.

I cannot find data adults-only, US hit 50% population fully vaccinated August. end April ~31%.

From January end April almost 200k people died pandemic US; 150k number Jan+Feb. Roughly 1/4 2021 deaths-to-date May; roughly 1/5 January February. late neat.  Right time, us expected.

SARS-CoV-2 first discovered late 2019. Delta first discovered late 2020. late 2021.

If variant cause next batch waves, another... another... probably yet another. Ok, hear out, I'm also frustrated, think authorities problem, least state. minor family (but household) positive covid. nurse calls parents getting official positive result tells everyone else household need take test. come back negative, nurse tell need quarantine, minors even go school! minor ""quarantined"" house sharing least bathroom others, like completely isolated. think ridiculous. Frosty shot? Bad news sells make sensational better. coworker pulled one yesterday discussing booster.

A sidenote- lost boyfriend Covid 3 months ago.

I get it. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Yawn It‚Äôll interesting see sure. Countries/States controlled initial delta wave seem getting hit hard again. Thanksgiving Eve? Oh lucky going one day salt sugar, man. Loss efficacy time. boosters recommended CDC.

Not hard wear boy suck ten twenty minutes time.  don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs good, dammit, it‚Äôs awesome. quite possible know talking don‚Äôt need condescending tone.

There ""tone"" post. 0 need get upset. going argue you, maybe state showing hospitalization 80%. hard believe every study I've seen shows much higher hospitalization age groups doubly vaccinated. snapshot Israel (November 9th), linked Scott Gottlieb's Tweeter. Still shows solid hospitalization age groups (ok 1 point 65-69).  Hail Fauci Oh, got cannibal bees now. forget immunocompromised people. ok bud, another! obligation engage standards demand. I‚Äôm gonna tell right now‚Ä¶. don‚Äôt care. got shots, year whatever told. there‚Äôs high chance I‚Äôm solid catch it. We‚Äôre moving on. Yeah. argument anti vax mom family eating outdoors. live area great weather fun. Damn, hope everyone ok, stays safe healthy.

These hard times times Good ones. Take care yours. Yes. Lots data Israel that. Cases fell dramatically. R0 fell 1.    risk myocarditis Covid far greater thsn vaccine. well many Covid complications. myocarditis viruses usually far serious vaccine, mild resolves days most.  


Also Israel incidence myocarditis booster far less 2nd dose. Yep, went got booster soon available last month (and flu shot week that). I'm ""only"" 51 qualified former smoker. people part city (northeast Valley) still masking up, helps. neighborhood still 62% fully vaccinated though. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Have awesome safe Thanksgiving! Wasn‚Äôt vaccine places widely available like April-May? immune compromised people.

No, there's hard evidence increase hospitalization vaccinated people due immune compromised people. safe bet significant portion figure, it.

Additionally, studies showing [reduced vaccine effectiveness obese presumably significant portion number well. suppose could lump immune-compromised group, really proper. Yes, guys grifters. money followers, thing care about. Yeah rough ending rough year. I‚Äôm fully recovered least fully I‚Äôll ever be. 

Best advice give religiously physical therapy much say can. PT gave exercises 2x day. couldn‚Äôt work anyways time asked would hurt 5x+ day instead‚Ä¶ said long there‚Äôs pain much possible. exercises every couple hours every single day.

Also cleaned diet went plant based whole foods drank water ever life (hydration important lol).

Doctor originally said wouldn‚Äôt kiteboarding least year possibly never. back water within 3 months, surgery, really fancy custom brace stabilized protected leg. months ago ditched brace feeling great. 

I respect doctors certainly listen instructions, fucked times life listen PTs regards recovery. Don‚Äôt let doctors demotivate they‚Äôre overly cautious comes stuff like that. PTs much positive getting back action.

5 years ago fucked patellar tendon could walk flat/stable ground. Doctor told there‚Äôs nothing ‚Äúthat tendon like rubber band it‚Äôs stretched surgery therapy bring back‚Äù. Told would never hike camber ground patellar for.

I CRUSHED, literally went depression, though life knew over. love hiking.

Then PT time said ‚Äúnon sense! Work ass we‚Äôll hiking again!‚Äù. worked, patellar probably still fucked like Doctor said reason didn‚Äôt take account could develop muscles around recover way. exactly still hike time!

Doctors promise comes recovery, understand don‚Äôt blame them. positive attitude important staying motivated everything need recover. don‚Äôt take diagnoses certainty always get multiple opinions, physical injuries listen PTs anyone! always try PT surgery.

My friend blew back doctor swore he‚Äôd need surgery essentially fuse spine would prevent sorts stuff. Instead spent 2 years becoming essentially master yogi, flexible guy know couldn‚Äôt even touch toes. still regularly sends 40ft cliffs skiing.

It almost sounds like pneumonia flu! :( Glad okay! Stay safe there. old folks do. Look vaccination percentages population 65. Ok. hospitalization rates? Long covid rates? Death rates? According latest research, mostly buzzwords.

I'll see out. . . could put dead bodies ahead they‚Äôd step right carefully get stilettos dirty TikToking show ‚Äúthey care‚Äù. point US COVID wave pool beyond wrong. 

We protect ourselves, one easiest let unvaxxed shores.  Yes ..that's point. one's trying argue vaccines directly increased covid deaths. lack lockdowns presence alpha delta probably contributed most. Everyone assumes unvaccinated catching covid. multiple fully vaccinated people work catch covid. Ive seen multiple people FB vaccinated catch too. got vaccine December? 

(Drum roll, please.)

""Starting January, Biden administration........"" lab bulk testing city. 29% positive 2k tests. great. that‚Äôs unvaccinated covid patients without legitimate medical exemption de-prioritized hospital care, there‚Äôs really lot space denied altogether. say ""the authorities"", kind mythical figure, not, fact, simply roles filled ignorant people.

I booster shot, getting fully vaxed back April. safe attend bar N95 mask drinking? 

I'm trouble finding information kind protection I'm working here/what chances able infect others is?  beginning November, Russia experienced excess mortality around eight hundred thousand people since start covid-19 pandemic. According calculations Dmitry Kobak Ariel Karlinsky, statisticians tracked global covid-related deaths since last year, Russia surpassed world‚Äôs previous leader, United States, terms total excess deaths, trails Peru Bulgaria terms per-capita worst over: people currently dying covid-19 Russia point pandemic. Officially, number twelve hundred per day, Alexey Raksha, demographer forced Russia‚Äôs state statistics agency last year, estimates figure actually nearly four thousand. end year, country‚Äôs death toll likely reach million.  30% European countries children. UK example 14% population 12, making 86% vaccination rate possible. Right, think based pretty good theories. end day that's researchers discover lay people medical background. originally thought Hydroxychlorquine + antibiotic golden hour drug delivered time would stop viral replication, based remember correctly small observation france. tested larger setting results bad end tests point clinical evidence helped letting people die. theory ivermectin, heard postulated early reason South Africa spared virus comparatively vast majority people issues parasites younger generation takes ivermectin regular basis. enough people run holy grail. personally seen qualitative studies lay person in-depth medical knowledge (I helped medical research documentation research read know implications) matter need know currently medical professionals stated effective qty people dosing toxic.  


But lastly new one, fluvoxamine, antidepressant appears positive large study brazil seems passing mustard scientific review front know team ivermectin take one instead going take quasi-placebo might well take one actually positive trendlines.   Introverts still thriving pandemic. Got boosted last week (in nyc) preparation another surge. Getting mask fatigue keeping anticipation it. think people (who previously infected) expect infected next 12-18 months.

We know infection followed vaccination (one vaccination - second one adds nothing) provides strong immune response. (but don't) know works way round (vaccination followed infection). obviously boost immunity perhaps much infection followed vaccination.

What certain vaccinations infections increase resistance Covid eventually defeat (make endemic). I'm tired. üòñ next cycle fear mongering. year

Why next year? starting now? Full TimeCase Investigator (New York)-- absolutely true STILL difficult job effectively based previous commenter said. one robust Contact Tracing Case Investigation initiatives country job much harder lack accountability awareness individuals bring individual situations local/state/national/global issue like one.  


Not even talking vaccinations--waning immunity real thing. interview lots people daily immunized still think free pass whatever want, ...guess what? COVID. I'm hoping boosters child vaccinations make enough dent winter hellscape. I'm dreading next two weeks work holiday. Thanks much link interesting informative article. hope rollout speeds country. I'm boosted, parents boosted, grandparents boosted. I'm going home Thanksgiving. Finally. virus follows trend line, aerosol based communicable disease spikes air lower humidity (winter) week two major holiday gatherings (Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years) lot diverse groups gathering one location, often travelled mass transit lot 'unknown' carriers point. wave first contact people encountered people. I'm sure lot weather. Northern places cold right now, everyone's indoors. Early adopters vaccine waning immunity. people got earlier probably reinfected. There's reason say Covid one done, that's people 'natural immunity' disillusioned. 5th wave? Damn dude, whole extra wave ahead us. How'd that? parents would give kids dosage forced choose.

Seriously! would forgone dose walked around house wearing mask 18 months meant getting daughter vaccinated didn‚Äôt miss entire year preschool well, basically everything else.  might cautious, sure fear justified point.

yeah, getting point fear unhealthy. covid vaccinated. need?

you maybe speak someone fear certainly healthy. course means vulnerable populations unfortunately fucked. Outside subset, people wanted vaccine, chances they've already got it. others want it? Well, vaccinated done waiting get back life.

I'm saying dark time people get vaccine medical conditions such. feel them, really do, I'll keep wearing mask publix., vaccinated liberal american, I'm done tiptoing around postponing plans. We've passed March 2020 4 times currently triple that. yeah, got answers. putting risk might agree, putting others risk selfish. sign stupidity, moral failure. billion warnings since February 2020 people still stupid protect loved ones. problem ending pandemic breakthrough infections, contagious are. Alpha breakthrough infections contagious. Delta, pre-symptomatic contagiousness essentially unvaccinated. That's declining antibodies; level cellular immunity generated 2-dose vaccination enough scale pace Delta reproduces. stark contrast post-infection immunity, antibody levels lower start yet there's measurable decline immunity 18 months pandemic.

The shocking thing actually inefficient Covid Delta. Nearly vaccines require multiple doses separated many months years get strong sterilizing immunity, yet managed pre-Delta VOC's single dose. wasn't. actually got side effects besides little arm pain got flu shot. hear giving friends COVID can't handle stupid shit really great mental health. even worse. That‚Äôs good point. even so, there‚Äôs mRNA foundational technology specific applications, hopefully many, many come. I‚Äôm patent expert I‚Äôd assume means even COVID vaccine widely understood duplicatable, companies like Pfizer plenty opportunities continue generating new, patented drugs built research. reduces value get keep extracting particular product probably means future competition, doesn‚Äôt sound like existential threat bad thing society large.

It's close Canada unlikely hit official death toll.  reddit immunologist. Lol truthful. real risk covid *infection*, vaccine. It'd false imply difference vastly different there's one real risk one light risk.

Much different people squarely it. would explain highest percentage vaccinated areas experiencing highest COVID rates right now?

As remote employee, happy missing anything, former in-office employee, miss whole lot office culture. job market live salary command remote, could live great office culture. now, there's not.

The thing returning office one person going alone effective one person getting vaccinated. needs critical mass useful. way reach critical mass mandates. Ironic sub making point.

Dude, getting house dangerous. There's reason think people understand covid can't still go around maybe wear mask crowded places...

Its binary choice. live completely normal life still getting vaccine boosters maybe wearing mask while. Wish true here. see hordes people big rows cars front houses nobody wears masks, single one. Hell no. continually spreading false info regarding vaccines telling people they‚Äôd get Guillan Barre syndrome got it. It‚Äôs something like 0.00008% (can‚Äôt remember hospital study).

We're fully vaccinated boosters weeks ago, like dentist going look another one, damn near impossible find one patients wear masks here. 

Guess point live SW Florida, soul wears masks unless half staff medical office wearing day. 

Based see area, can't imagine surge soon. Moderna booster side effects, whereas felt awful 2nd dose. Dude really freaking simple. Get vaccinated, going sit plane, train, bus, public space 100s people, wear mask. really hard. Please stop complaining. shots safe hurt. Wearing mask *VERY SITUATIONALLY* hard either. one asking stay inside see family friends. matter might improve future, people choose now.

It particularly reasonable talk year ago, sheer fantasy talk eradication now.

Endemicity come lower virulence though like 1918 H1N1 pandemic transitioned endemic seasonal influenza (mostly formation cross-reactive T-cell responses vaccinated recovered, necessarily evolution virus).

Edit: okay. guess good news bad thing somehow. Whatever. happen matter minutes exposure Covid. tone deaf comparisons like need stop. wonder US one worse hit countries.

Dark may seem, may darwining pretty hard. Yep. Things objectively worse. live big city area cut pandemic social support weeks ago. addition general increase persons mental health crisis streets, I‚Äôm seeing lot homelessness generally. It‚Äôs terribly depressing even though don‚Äôt feel particularly vulnerable (financially stable, vaccinated co-morbidities). 

The fall virus literally everywhere.  anti-lockdown marches weekends people yelling wear mask, prices everything up, ask new hires vaccination status. good things like less crowded subways elevators, working home, overall uniformly health worry, financial struggles social divide.

I think ignoring may way cope sake mental health. It‚Äôs reality still one part reality whole. don‚Äôt think disconnecting news trying distract focusing things objectively good wrong selfish. pandemic going exist matter little much attention give it, focusing energy things make feel better makes sense. say, miss 100% shots take.

Seems working great took 14x likely die. percent... 92% less likely die vaccinated. them. YAY!   Two weeks me. Booster Bros! know exactly meant - know meant? reason continues spread. vaccine stop getting stop spreading it. Thats called mutation. Flu every year. Professional? Perhaps not. absolutely correct. tried local grocery stores pharmacies? places don‚Äôt require appointment. 


 I‚Äôve even seen places like Costco offering vaccines without appointment. Except unvaccinated much larger share deaths. China submitted vaccine approval, kinda hard approve nobody's asking data. Indian one mean? US disinformation pretty insane - russia, either, grassroots. intensely misinformed under-educated people living US. Yup, what's relevance thread? I'm cancer patient 4 years treatment, body refuses develop immune response anything. Polio vaccine, fail, pnemonia fail. 2 covid shots booster..fail, immunity. I'm tired fucking trapped house. Stop fucking around already seems unlikely. Eventually it‚Äôs going run vulnerable hosts. won‚Äôt spread forever. Thank restoring glimmer hope humanity. Reading posts rather depressing. work vaccine clinic. 300 shots gave today, think four initial doses. Maybe another 3-4 2nd doses recently vaccinated folks. continue trickle in, whole lot. Lots first kid age 5-11 doses though! think gonna tough winter, hoping spring brings glimmers relief. system strained right now, lots lots sick people. covid, many stuff forced board ER beds. glad relatively less stressful job preventing sickness sympathetic actually treating sick. Get shots, get boosters, wear seatbelts, stay hospital. basing on? Data vaccines pretty good prevention severe illness even fairly long term. wouldn‚Äôt even know Covid still around wasn‚Äôt news reminding Yep! Even boosters supposed provide ninety percent protection. Apparently, that's working. Easy imagine organ transplant immune-compromised.  looking you... working. Every time there's fresh outbreak Korea always linked cult. Wonder they're allowed exist elaborate? they're gambling people's lives too. can't wait kids get shot protected this. adults stupid. every day, throw summaries every often. far they've shown vast majority people test positive unvaccinated (somewhere 80-95% depending time state). However far know separate children, necessarily prove vaccine efficiency, prevalence children high. I‚Äôm getting feeling many vaccine hesitant relying heavily anecdotes rather institutions

It's numbers game. That's plan, see says.  know, sad. We've done vaccines thought going happen, UK least approach masks poor, lead government. We've let cases soar people seemingly care. sad. It‚Äôs 26 hours since got booster, 3 Pfizer. right arm sore, course, also right lower rib cage, right hip front butt, right thigh. lower right side back killing me, like pinched nerve that‚Äôs kind dull. 

Anyone else familiar kind reaction? long term complications top it. Lol people love guarantees, want know stop worrying go out. people immunologists, they're trying need get crisis. Insurance companies motivated bottom line, nothing more. didn‚Äôt say well. meant didn‚Äôt foresee anti-vaxx movement subverting vaccinations would save lives. Canada almost certainly many deaths year last: that's good metaphor Aww cute, anti-vax'ers trying make us think extend everything suddenly everyone anything unhealthy left cold.

Nice try. Get vaccinated. know everyone's situation different, certainly understand would hesitant given previously Guillain-Barre. spouse's cousin also Guillain-Barre years ago, cleared get vaccinated COVID done fine. I'm saying therefore fine you, wanted share little bit know. Check-in neurologist doctors. Stay safe! Giving full explanation Russia got situation answering question full going take far long. I‚Äôd recommend quitting silly social media comments learning history. Thank unvaxxed idiots making special treat possible. flu

I keep hearing intense non-flu-symptom-like things one guy got covid, like coughing blood. He'd shots booster. Huge yikes. got shot nurse said taking ibuprofen acetaminophen time. recommended alternating throughout day could get consistent relief without going daily maximum recommended doses. Yes. really matter much booster get. 5th wave? Pretty sure number higher. transmissibility severity unknown, time freak yet. following certainly anti-vaxxers too. I've long said... People moan whine, comes it, rolling rolling sleeves. Anecdotal evidence useful. Although may experience, represent bigger picture.

Taken data, 7 100k unvaccinated people die contracting virus, vaccinated folk 0.5.

The death rate unnvacinated people 14 times higher currently massive improvement worthwhile have. But, need combine masks still testing reduce spread, especially amongst unnvacinated.  Lunatics like called out, heh. Someone it...  mouth course accident general. Obama sent immigrants vax-i-nate kids. New wave, new wave, new wave, new wave. Fear mongering! New wave, new wave, new wave. sh*t ever end... always tell people wear masks home someone positive person sleep/quarantine separate room everyone else (if possible), open windows, much ventilation possible, plus wash hands, social distance, work home, etc etc etc, 10 days test negative I‚Äôm scared right now. three people Thanksgiving I‚Äôm control it. Everyone home tests first vaccinated seeing stuff like makes freak out.   Wearing masks become aesthetic never stop. love them. That's bullshit know it. goalposts keep getting moved wealth keeps transferred top 1%. Vaccines ticket nightmare, masks social distancing. must counties still mask mandate. sure covid restrictions talking still see problem? Current triage criteria rational predictable. suggestion would turn complicated mess introducing additional ill-defined variable process. Let's look example, kind cancer 50 y/o have? smoker, drink recommended, eat much grilled fatty foods? well known greatly increase chance getting cancer. know large percentage cancer cases (and heart decease) caused lifestyle choices. unvaxxed 50 y/o sole breadwinner family 4? suggestion would turn simple efficient process trial moral character candidate must thoroughly examined making decision.  nope. covids sickness now. cough? covid. headache? covid. sneeze? covid. didnt u get memo? friend Finland thought US taking masking seriously visited 2 weeks ago, take that. hated businesses Covid restrictions thought way restrictive general.  100% unvaccinated last year..  career showbiz. Break leg! That‚Äôs probably never going happen, least years. antivaxxers made choice. I'm living normal life Pfizer. become asymptomatic carrier get infected me, blame themselves. I‚Äôm really worried kids, I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll even able find life partner children with. put dating hold masked/and distanced moving together seemed like much gamble. risk really worth living life like we've done past two years, wearing masks time avoiding crowds? ever end? risk averse ski even drive car, let alone take motorcycle taxi Thailand get wasted bar Malaysia without knowing get home. Oh bad bot. know rules still waves? really doesmt matter. flu vaccine miss last years, complete miss year.

Using statistics properly hard. 

Did know people poorly school ended world's leading scientists? April December 9 months (all except January, February, March); March December 10 Truth.  question is‚Ä¶will show 2nd shot? Booster? home tests first. That‚Äôs family guests doing. hospitals dont covid wards anymore. havent while. theyre fine vaccine great (and everyone get it), people still develop long covid symptoms even vaccinated. need stop treating like okay tons people get covid long end hospitalized. know covid clotting disease long term organ damage, even people severe cases.

We also need consider cases means chances spawn new variants. Even covid becomes endemic better everyone fewer cases.

So couple bad days, risk person long term organ damage risk everyone end worse variant already have.

We need better job normalizing rampant infection community spread ""totally acceptable"". Covid patients generally clog hospitals takes long inevitably die. simply true entire Healthcare system city still partly broken due last surge. Dme short supply, snfs low beds, hospitals still capacity due patients medical needs neglected last surge. 


I never thought would say think time start sending unvaccinated covid patients back home cause collateral deaths vaccinated patients. literally Healthcare infrastructure deal perpetual waves covid. Incorrect. children vaccinated lot cases occurring. It‚Äôs feasible. infrastructure you‚Äôre viewing unrealistically. Healthcare professionals actually make decisions decisions require complex logistics. also unfair burden healthcare professionals solution obviously simply vaccination. coming. really can't believe happening again.

Also protect vulnerable people society. Like pregnant women cancer patients. Unless want stop that. evidence indicate case. Epidemiologists science-y people concluded Delta's increased transmissibility raised vaccination rate needed limit seriousness outbreaks. live area 50% people vaccinated - going long winter parts.  sickest ever got Pneumonia got Valley fever. miss diagnosed every antibiotic gave would help day would get worse again. hopital week oxygen. Literally anything. laptop switch even energy play games switch 45 minutes time. get biopsy lungs, experience never want repeat. Missed Christmas New Years year. Probably one worst experiences life.

It's guys! /s think guys analysis wrong (due spreadsheet sucking). 'unvaccinated' rows, 'death rate' calculated, might comparing share population vs death rate? Maybe happens chance particular week?

I pivot excel, calculating na√Øve death rate (divide deaths population). Average death rate 3-4 times higher unvaccinated. excel-fu sucks now, pasting Reddit sucks, here's got.

For age 10-59 

21 days first dose	0.000191786 
Second dose	                    5.43323E-05 
Unvaccinated	                0.000451294 
Within 21 days first dose	    0.000171556

This indicative vaccines work (along studies :), although, course, there's nothing say populations similar, even adjusting age groups ... maybe healthier people choose vaccinate (or vice versa). mutations spike protein concern terms bypassing existing immunity. incredible thing last year mRNA vaccine figured within weekend. definitely could new vaccine next week start switching production that. frustrating thing we'd go many months trials essence waiting enough people control group die.

CDC also recommend vaccination 90 days infection, well.

at least last saw. yet stupid article like one keep making assertion viral RNA load = infectious viral load.   Eh, wuss. Wearing mask social distancing little bit big deal.

I'll assume 18 24 years old seem impulsive. Imagine 18 24-year-olds inconvenienced something like world war II concerns losing time seem lame.

Every couple decades kind big unfortunate event happens living one. happenstance nature humanity. could world war, could global depression, actually lot better either those. Even decade horrible weather bring planet knees far covid we've seen happen too.

It's like we're guaranteed live good times Golden ages. make best cards dealt.   solve problem legally unable though... Spain, every 10 people hospitalized, 7 people fully vaccinated, 3 given vaccine all

Reading text heading image, gut reaction likely hospitalized covid vaccinated unvaccinated.

But that's opposite article headline saying.  federal one. nothing airline one. Make sure don‚Äôt find out? üòõ Dumb dumb dumb countries like Germany Austria kept mask mandates place.  Compare current infection rates countries. Wasn‚Äôt shown risk myocarditis higher Moderna? ACLU right. banned flights probably serious enough due process.   totally undermine statistic anyhow? Half shots could gone outsiders would mean little half city vaccinated...  mask like piece clothing get one fits well you.

We need begin acknowledge psychological barriers wanting mask forever goes beyond physical comfort. one first mask, wore rigorously, thought wearing forever vaccinated person putting. Yeah way go holiday season. It‚Äôs likely going main body pandemic February 2022. 

If vaccines widely available adopted readily would avoid scenario similar delta. delta spread world I‚Äôd put chances another variant better extremely unlikely. means holiday season last chance virus advantageously spread.  combination conferred natural immunity provide large enough barrier stymie anything occasional pocket outbreak. 

That‚Äôs I‚Äôm betting. New Years you‚Äôll reverberations people spreading got large gatherings back local communities, ending beginning/middle February.

Germs real. germ real. millions dead people millions long term effects real. assume there's lots different mindsets being. people probably realize threat vaccine. people think exaggerated threat course there's good chance get going like normal slightly severe cold they're going say see hahaha big lie.

That's kind problem world mostly morons, new problem. problem every time new serious illness comes out. There's always loads deniers nowadays full power automated communication networks help spread b*******.

I think one thing people really think opened doors dirt cheap communication Internet limiting factor enough success money get Mass distribution media also filter prevented worst people getting easy access mass. 

In day age cost become major regulating force media, removed cost barrier removed forms media regulation also regulated.

Cable TV similar effect, nowhere near bad wild wild West unregulated nature internet. anything comes fact distribute media millions billions people tenth less used cost unfortunately allows radical voices access easy mass media distribution previously.

So end day life kind goes normal internet intellectual people intellectual normal people ignore things radicals get massive benefit ones locked media two groups.

That's big problem current media structure. actually happens every time new communication medium comes out. They're always regulated bunch worst people see opportunity exist normal people keep normal stuff actually get much benefit.

For normal audiences news changed much, radicalized audience news gotten vastly aggressive longer limited broadcast cable networks. Vaccinated people always able spread virus though About. Damn. Time. Hah, still live March 2020!

And, well, always bit luck. seem helping along quite bit. January... February/March vaccine takes proper hold. best part says vaccines still useful independently variant may bring. understand put 'Do Fly' list except pure greed.  problem PCR though detects viral RNA. ability detect actual infectious virions. voting absolutely pathetic around here. 
we need stop catering ppl refuse get vaccinated. line drawn somewhere. Particularly bragging turning information.  Hopefully, use genome adapt mRNA vaccines fast said able to, regulatory authorities learned lesson slow rolling things.  I‚Äôm reading South Africa something like 20% Covid vaccination coverage. 

I would worried highly vaccinated, would indicate new variant defeating overwhelming vaccination conferred immune coverage.

Keep mind, variant successful in, say, United States, contend public already exposed transmissible variant therefore, combination relatively high vaccination rates natural immunity.

As I‚Äôve stated mutations spike protein, immunizations based on, likely changes also likely lock virus able infect cells. what‚Äôs left mechanism evolves make better replicating, score beat delta variant, can‚Äôt evolve transmissible delta (achieving r value 8+) won‚Äôt effect anywhere vaccinations natural immunity combine effective barrier transmission.  right thing incredibly easy.

You cite article saying vaccination status alone determine whether patient receives care. Cool. agree.

Then goes list kinds contingencies Doctors deny care based vaccination status. also agree with. Overflowing hospital ICUs turning away non-COVID critical patients one contingencies.

If there's anything defines American culture, complacency lack empathy, folks situation always argument people challenge mask wearing.   I'm concerned b.1.1.528 b.1.1.527.

The actual fatality rate likely similar Covid-19. way wholesome. Exactly. you‚Äôre vaccinated‚Ä¶live life. Masking distancing fully vaccinated?? Get that. what‚Äôs likelihood getting covid twice double vaxxed?

i got vax back april tested positive sept 2, i‚Äôve recently come symptoms past couple days. loss taste smell like before, runny/stuffy nose, sore throat, headache, fever. also flu shot.

That's fuckin gross.   also said becomes endemic, sailed long time ago. Today Spanish news said 2/3 ICU patients unvaccinated. Unfortunately, yes.

There lot mutations spike (32 total), something like 11 receptor binding domain. That's really, really big change. know effects be, good bet lot existing antibodies work. need proof fact it‚Äôs already 2 years it‚Äôs gotten worse shows sign slowing? waiting cure flu well?  vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent infection mildly effective people compromised immune systems, variant thought come due amount mutations contained single strain. HIV+ vaccinated may good combination breeding vaccine-escape variants. It‚Äôs unreasonable ask people mask indoors use AC Heat point. Indoor Masking small indoor family gatherings last year unlikely happening. It‚Äôs certainly happening cases year.   common think. know several people get tested visiting older family members   three medical students ? Tired smdh stupidity.

Good uk. wish would test  possible simultaneously oppose flying bans imposed without due process support part penalty assaulting people aboard aircraft, upon conviction. It‚Äôs shocking hasn‚Äôt presented widely sooner. never understood mask mandates fully imposed last year weren‚Äôt required go KN95s. Especially required working indoors. One reason I‚Äôm tired mask stuff ever working done best mask all. cloth masks highly ineffective blue surgical ones way less effective thank K95s. get you‚Äôre saying, 32 mutations spike protein doesn‚Äôt warrant ‚Äòsuper‚Äô front it, don‚Äôt know would. would vaccination record.... can't used you... Yup I'm buying used junk die young lose career. Lots great deals Craigslist!

You can't coddle people like this. need use ignorance them.  talking about? live ""Canada's largest province"" every day 50% vaccinated, 50% unvaccinated making new cases (it's little less also like 3% part-vaccinated making new cases). nowhere near oddly-specific way-off number 91% new cases unvaccinated. Currently, estimate vaccine reducing chance infection approximately 3 times. PERSONALLY know 2 people confirmed cases Covid double vaccinated (both 40), think happen know 2 total 9 people 60 ""breakthrough"" cases? get hundreds ""breakthrough cases"" every day! vaccines impact holy wow nothing like said. Well sounds like turning conspiracy theorist. us watching experts say and, though we're skeptical always, end day, we're following recommendations best can. sure publications reading. Kind sounds like Sanjay Gupta science every day getting closer communism lol  Welp, that's sucks lot, vaccination rate restrictions, great variant disperse country, world. know, would make question autoimmune issue making vaccine less efficient. I'd asking doctor.

Hope anything serious!    thought giving unsolicited opinions thread. point? seem implying vaccinated people responsible unvaccinated people ending ICUs. countries vaccine availability, simply true. vaccinated gives far longer lasting immunity natural immunity. Covid fuck immune system many people get Covid 2+ times.

Also 2 doses wane mean still provide immunity... Many vaccines need 2 doses long lasting immunity example Hepatitis B need 3 4 shots long lasting immunity. Hib need 3 doses. Well consiracy ""nuts"" turned much better predicting future. Covid passports, bi-annual mandated shots, masks social distancing stay forever(?).

Meanwhile experts got wrong every single way. First masks help do. First vaccines stop spread, illness death. reduce spread. spread much unvaxxed. get ill seriously. get seriously ill die. die much unvaxxed. still long way go. new normal stay seems  can't, that's sub rules know. know Moderna vaccine 3 times stronger Pfizer vaccine could account effective.  negative covid tests required air travel? requirements beyond wearing mask? 

Rapid covid tests airport would least cut spread covid, can't implement vaccine requirement. might even better. Rich guys usually charter private planes often themselves, 37k go much longer way. ones rich enough them, they're usually chartering flying plane actually making money covering even costs plus profit. work part time place shares office/hangar space charter company. nearly 90% fully vaccinated rate like Netherlands STILL good enough return normal?  asking whether people believe ‚Äúsuper strain‚Äù sets back everything square one, indeed proves much vaccine resistant strains increased chance inducing severe symptoms.

FWIW, virologists follow seem confident worst-case scenario avoided. life long Packers fan, someone who's waiting list season tickets last 27 years, I'll say - Fuck Aaron Rodgers. don‚Äôt need buy plane private flight chartered. Rich people can‚Äôt afford private typically fly first, rules much lax least amount incidents occur. Yep. time back, around time introducing boosters, read Israel working see vacccines might need upgraded variants eventually. think may ones watch. ahead game boosters.  IMO combo survivor bias unvaxed higher delayed disease prognosis / treatment vaxed pandemic. would think people unvaxed COVID already (so natural immunity) people unvaxed usually take many precautions get COVID (i.e. masking etc.), probably got pre-vaccine. ones going die COVID already vax. unvaxed group probably much higher rate natural immunity less people likely die COVID.

Also vaxed, probably large portion people avoided going doctor pandemic (again trying minimize exposure). resulted delayed / late diagnosis / treatment diseases (heart disease, cancer etc.) results deaths / untreatable diseases. effects seen around world right now. I'm triple vaxxed still need mask? Really?   asked  I'm starting think pandemic accepted world leaders perfect opportunity deliberate cull.  ain't wrong immune escape variant could less contagious/transmissible/virulent/lethal still outcompeting Delta infected people recovered/vaccinated better Delta.

At point fairly near future start happen regularity. Evolution practically demands happen.

Its likely new serotypes less lethal, unlikely they'll able escape T-cells increase hospitalization/fatality rates vaccinated/recovered individuals.

This happens human coronavirus 229E evolves every 5 years antigenically escape human immune system spread around world new serotype. probably going happen coronavirus well. problem we're going able watch real time every new mutation going cause loads anxiety past history Delta mutation.

At time possible worse-than-Delta mutation could happen displace Delta well.  point though long enough timeline Delta get displaced immune escape new serotype virus, seeing displacement Delta enough say new virus inherently worse.   Denmark months ago felt like different world. Absolutely masks anywhere, September dropped mandates. bizarre part got PCR test heading back states, people even wearing masks testing center - people working people getting tested.    I'm sick tired fact smoking causes cancer. Seems smoking caused cancer like fifty years now, long last ? think that's long enough.  I'm starting think maybe facts care feel them.   Uh, unsourced link unsourced charts

What even mean?

The charts coming editor chief large health publication.  chart referring reciting marginal tax brackets. showing effective rates. feel much. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated done restrictions, masks, mandates. It‚Äôs hurting mentally. 

I mean look thread. many people understand fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt want mask distance anymore. They‚Äôre criticizing people much wanting live normally. commenters need take look outside see majority people moving accepted Covid isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Eric Topol calls first variant since Delta looks ‚Äûquite concerning‚Äú Christina Pagel also sounds worried. reasonable views past. Obviously nothing‚Äôs certain right now, two concerned doesn‚Äôt look I‚Äôm hoping timing US too! 
If watched comment COVID toe unquestionably joke. stupid views media fumbled one running way did. Nah, fucking stupid told us could take masks vaccine, kids get vaccinated‚Ä¶ mean, people feel like goal posts keep moving Nope, nope, better madate federal funds COVID go building wall America Puerto Rico  Delta's secondary attack rate measured 25%. Measles 90%.

But short incubation period matters. delta triples infections every 4 days measles spreads 10x every two weeks delta could easily spread faster.  could imagining this, think FDA previously said would treat variant-specific boosters like flu shots, approving without completely new evaluation process. Based (very!) limited understanding mRNA vaccines, would make sense. 74% less likely get Covid fully vaccinated means vaccine greatly reduce spread. interesting find data 3 doses guessing even better.  I‚Äôm saying, want keep using masks, social distancing, transmission reduction measures old immunocompromised likely foreseeable future‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ok, don‚Äôt tell that‚Äôs change social contract before. Oh, wasn‚Äôt trying say people crappy, it‚Äôs there‚Äôs also large portion shitheads tend ruin things rest us, want get live lives little bullshit can. might vocal minority, sadly loudest people ones tend get attention. cares point          said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs soon tell‚Äù left that. don‚Äôt nearly enough data variant yet make kind highly sensationalized claims you‚Äôre making it. guess lost interest putting shitler away criminal is. Fuck something already. people get banned flying forever? fake cards anyway. fact we're using paper big brother era laughable That‚Äôs represented actual bracket calculations tax brackets tho, mention claim payouts outweighs taxes taken individuals nonzero position bracket doesn‚Äôt add up. Scientists seem alarmed compared precious variants. Fortunatelly reached mark thanks him. Yes, person said longer stops vaccinated vector spread. does, it‚Äôs 100%.  Yeah I‚Äôm pretty concerned us  Yeah purely political, comments replied. Probably going hit 1 million time over. US week till hit 800,000 deaths Covid.

Too many selfish stubborn Americans vaccinated rest society selfish basic things like wearing mask indoors.

In Ontario Canada pretty much everyone wears mask indoors 86.84% 12+ fully vaccinated.

I see wearing mask indoors big deal. still packed restaurants, movie theaters, stadiums concerts wear mask indoors unless eating drinking. 99% population follows government mandate.

We removing mask mandate till reach heard immunity probably around March/April. basic science. like said it‚Äôs zero sum game receptor binding domain changes, could potentially reduce infectivity thus cause Delta push out, kind like happened Mu?  TIL, thanks!  beat up, still prove vaccine saving us healthcare collapse. Well, clear, meant disrupting passengers, disrupting plan, disrupting business' operation, disturbing peace, pretty sure things illegal party calls police. sayin'. mean, passengers crying whining wearing masks pandemic one thing, attacking flight attendants, disrupting safety flight.... get another tax return till paid. believe also can't get passport till paid. think wages garnished also. Yeah get struggle every day. Luckily closest circle friends children age three also vaccinated we‚Äôre able socialize way picked daycare child start January. daycare hasn‚Äôt Covid outbreak since October 2020 I‚Äôm feeling good decision refuting ‚Äúmajority need hospital care‚Äù statement post I‚Äôm replying to. majority 51%, crafted response lowest number still majority.  POWs?  mRNA, possible anymore

Fucksticks still get vaccine  TSA experience. They're assholes. process. they're underpaid bored feet day. job. totally joyless.

There stuff wrong TSA really way employees jobs. Unless entitled asshole take offense fight shit really there.  worry measles smallpox polio. see coronavirus cannot rendered merely nuisance. cases stay low last summer, stop protecting vigilantly. Six months progress would enough convince we've turned corner. We're yet. Airlines love treating customers like absolute dog shit itching opportunity punish speaking it.   lockdown 90% vaccinated adult population.... kind crazy. NYT thinks pandemic since longer offer free access Corona 19 articles 

link pass paywall: Sounds like passengers cruisin' bruisin' People still work transport/production/processing/manufacture. businesses wont shut people starve/die without essentials. low level spread happen, that's spreads homes. ""if nobody meets indoors"" something totally unobtainable. much hope FDA actually acting quickly though? certainly seem taking sweet time Paxlovid. bystanders"", individuals whose thoughts ideas resemble observer, also attacked.  people act like probably raised act way... know man, rudest treatment received Quatar, followed UK, US third. polite Japan. ""whatevs""... Italy

Multiple trips country, btw Yeah perfect. Say hi work travel naturally scared could impact us work generally speaking I'm happy we're proactive rather reactive . true, Delta.

It's even true Alpha. studies even back March / April time showed waning immunity time talk booster shots started around time.

There‚Äôs excuse except severely mentally ill handful medications 2, there's also two parts: antibodies work (protection symptoms, spreading, hospitalization) B cells work (protection hospitalization death). Adorable.  I'll explain like 5. 5 people city 2010, 2020 20 people. 20 people got vaccinated census 2010 indicating 5 people town. Since that's recent data have, use end 400% vaccinated, perfectly possible real.

Do understand need picture too?  like beating dead horse shall never mention again, meant beginning, everyone (EVERYONE) would taken correct precautions, Covid could died tracks. Truly plausible scenario anymore.

Oh, (vaccinated individuals accounted 0.8% May. say again, cannot help want helped, cannot protect want protected, I'm going keep sacrificing life unvaccinated willfully galavant normal vacations gatherings.

By worry mate, eventually astronomical numbers come willfully unvaccinated whither away. Great way deflecting blame anti Vax idiots literally reason Europe shit storm in. like guys literally asking wave. Vaccine mandates sound ""draconian"" ?  don‚Äôt know ‚Äúmost people‚Äù worried yet.

Take care, buddy! politicians made covid political issue health issue   There‚Äôs reason believe true point. Honk Kong man twice vaccinated waning immunity- similar breakthrough transmissibility Delta seems likely there.

Mutations mean differences. definitively mean deadlier. definitively mean transmissible. 

Don‚Äôt freak out. Keep eye news don‚Äôt led headlines. It‚Äôs far likely fizzle flare shadow Delta.

South Africa abysmal vaccination rates, surge means little nothing us point. Keep eye countries higher vaccination rates, starters. 

Soon scientists know every mutation spike protein does, it‚Äôs worth mental health assuming mRNA vaccines ineffective due RBD either. yet anyway.

Be well. wary, well.  would mainly depend whether repeated exposure virus makes bodies capable defeating think able predict yet.

No, unvaccinated people responsible getting ICUs vaccinated first place.

What I‚Äôm trying say is: vaccine godmode cheatcode. Getting vaccinated absolutely great, every person gets jab aiding ending nightmare. However, going pretending we‚Äôre pandemic anymore it‚Äôs over, make so. fact, opposite. 

To protect ourselves, society (economy, schools, healthcare workers) general, vaxxed people need realize still get infected transfer virus. even though may get sick it, every X infections someone end hospital, percentage ICU, never leave. 

I‚Äôm saying need get zero cases deaths simply impossible, virus stay, like regular flu. I‚Äôm saying pretending doesn‚Äôt exist anymore safe, won‚Äôt make back sooner. SA hundred cases handful detected. early say.   Europe split 2

Honestly, me. actually got admit like government mandates since personally never stuff allow stuff require, people mask feel bit safer near restaurants closed less quarrels family want go there.

However, think problem actually polarization everything basically wrong. fact, combined amount low case load + high restrictions would required ""voluntarily"" go e.g. shopping restaurants way restrictive basically ever. However, time existing restrictions (I mean, currently lockdown, get tested whatever) sometimes reason enough people go shopping restaurants themselves, i.e. economy reduced people restrictions low high.  article paywall. anyone summarize article please?   don't.

It could put small bottles injected people directly. taking one seriously. Im astonished quick coordinated response personally. really unprecedented pandemic. seems lot justified interest, maybe consideration alarming, alarms false. Also, seems specific evidence defeats vaccines ( happy corrected source ) unsure getting number 55, new cases last week, quick google search shows last two weeks 793 new cases. Looking last week alone, 328 cases.

Correcting error, would 793 cases/ 34,002 people (approximate Gibraltar population). Again, place 100% adult population vaccinated, would 2.33% population contracting COVID last two weeks. 

Now let‚Äôs compare rate United States, roughly 1/3 adults aren‚Äôt vaccinated. last two weeks, United States seen 1,306,000 cases last two weeks. 1,306,000 cases/ 329,500,000 people = 0.396% population contracting COVID last two weeks.

2.33%/0.396% = 5.88 times infection rate United States. 

TL:DR

118% adults fully vaccinated = 2.33% population COVID last two weeks, vs. 59% entire US population fully vaccinated = 0.396% population COVID last two weeks. 

Math doesn‚Äôt add me, take will, doesn‚Äôt affect however decide. pull statistics Ireland Singapore would like well. Thanks, good one.  300 1000 Gauteng week 80% new variant actual legitimate numbers, still awful. meet mom understand way are.  I'll keep getting boosters. I'm 4th shot now. Keep em coming. American drivers licenses entered chat  airlines considered whiffed that. Battered employees less expensive uproar lawsuits would ensue actually enforced solution. 

It's things gotten control support feds cracking bit more. question whether person ever get covid, many times person get covid. Immunity contracting virus shown wane much faster immunity vaccines, currently waning fast everyone needed booster six months.

The number infections directly increases chances new variants emerging. also clear covid cause long term organ damage, even people mild symptoms. real dangers mitigate controlling case rates behavioral restrictions. 

The answer ""what do?"" impose restrictions case rates get high prevent rampant community spread well continue push vaccines. people vaccinated better manage case rates shorter, less frequent, less restrictive ""lockdowns"" need be. took ""off books"" booster August ""official"" one couple weeks ago. I'll keep taking every couple months. Considering Delta killed vaccinated aunt despite hundreds posts saying fearmongering first, eh - best cautious  Absolutely, I‚Äôm extremely pleased effect vaccines. point it‚Äôs enough prevent hospitalizations completely. lot people take kind proof vaccine doesn‚Äôt work, either antivaxx, read headlines, doesn‚Äôt fully understand statistics behind. know new variant, nothing Vietnam one, turned different variant speaking second time closed down. inane take spread. work healthcare. inpatient numbers slowly ticking back up. Mentally preparing shit storm weeks.

I watch shoppers stores less 10% wear masks... I'm certain going bad. Ya right. predicted whole thing 2020, cut China rest world activities, people, physical goods, transportation, etc. I'm sorry see getting downvoted. feel people communicate viewpoints Thanks mRNA, possible anymore. New mutations problem - humans are. us stupid realize (may) need get additional shots cover new variants well, thanks new spike proteins. people interpret ""The vaccines work all"". links fast spreading there? IE SA? Yeah dread response toddler  Probably. Ufff, damn, antivaxxers gonna love it. even antivaxxer, still makes wonder - vaccinated country Europe yet still put restrictions action.  That's good sign though. Better safe sorry. seems infecting hell south africa hang calm then. perhaps positive signals taken seriously immediately? 


With Delta seem remember 'under investigation' long time, along many variants, governments take seriously soon enough time branded 'variant concern' already late.

Negativity often positive sign. too, concerning reading example CureVac releasing new vaccine recently - still updated variants barely matching Pfizer. Novavax releasing barely works variants. non epidemiologist brain wants know:

If variant ends outcompeting delta causes milder disease could really good thing? in, might lessen impact delta without worse consequences? I‚Äôm aware don‚Äôt info severity disease causes yet, trying think optimistically.  used work popular restaurant baker/chef, like lines door rave reviews, celebrity food guy liked went ""viral"" really word. unfortunately made little two booth establishment swell weekends far past capacity lines around block. strict order sitting policy, usually people pretty chill about.

Also reiterate, emergence variants directly tied number infections. Even view lockdown standpoint, makes sense shorter less restrictive lockdowns throw caution wind deal major restrictions long period time variants emerge current vaccines effective against.

The people vaccinated actually follow imposed restrictions less restrictive shorter ""lockdowns"" be. Well fuck. til second paragraph. going blame flight attendants this? Jesus....

Thanks, dad doctor definitely made cautious ways. need read article know ramp detection reported cases, indicator virulence. know without reading specific article we've repeatedly, already. could one cases mutations spike protein make resistant antibodies also make different enough harder infect cells. Delta example still covered well vaccines, puts much virus overwhelms immune system. least early response. previous crises mask wearing mandatory always limited brief period time.

There wide spread testing possibilities would know threat people literally dying streets. That's people masked up.

Now use masks extended amount time control spread, without possibility see imminent danger. Humans simple. long feel affected, want act. part zombies attack? lol  People choose live lives choose take seriously don‚Äôt want to, make worse everyone else increase probability mutations. 

A lot people think vaccine makes invincible, unfortunately reality. mean, sure, specific locale could put laws effect place time period, they'd quickly run people actually enforce laws on, everybody ~~left saner pastures!~~ died. Sure, lived life keeping risk literally zero, kids would never leave house. Life entails risk, least personally, Thanksgiving dinner important part childhood.  exactly.

From Results:

""In vaccinated unvaccinated, great variation among individuals, Ct-values &lt;15 UeS HYT data (Fig. 1A, 1B). Similarly, statistically significant differences found mean Ct-values asymptomatic (UeS: 24.3; HYT: 25.4) vs. symptomatic (UeS: 22.7) samples, overall stratified vaccine status (Fig. 1B). Similar Ct-values also found among different age groups, genders, vaccine types (Supplemental Figure 1).""

However, administrative medical experts analyzed Japan closely concluded Japan's statistics true.

And put forward hypotheses Japan.

Japan never, effect, enforced compulsory control citizens corona period. implemented recommendations support policies.

In addition, time initial spread Corona, dealt mainly severe patients conduct PCR tests mild asymptomatic patients despite pressure public opinion. even follow movement confirmed person.

This increased possibility group immunity due spread natural infection mild corona. Japan, even vaccination rate 50%, number confirmed cases deaths already dropping sharply. influence group immunity strong.

In addition, Japanese citizens followed government's recommendations. Japanese medical scientists said movement entire Japanese population decreases 20%, spread Corona decrease sharply. Currently, movement Japanese citizens decreased 25%.

Now Vaccination rates Japan nearly 80% complete. However, doubts effectiveness vaccine, Japanese government instructed schools forcibly recommend vaccination minors.

Lastly, Japanese people wearing masks daily basis since 2017, common people wear masks. However, Japanese government banned children wearing masks respiratory damage.

Currently, Japanese government assumes spread crisis occurs every two months, expanding subject free tests securing hospital beds preparation sixth epidemic.

It's worked fine millions. antigen tests low false positive rates (99.9% specificity Abbott BinaxNOW, instance). False negatives (when measured PCR) much higher, really big problem might seem, since false negatives result low viral shedding, might high enough PCR detect, would unlikely result virus transmission.

False positives happen, extremely common. immunologic phenomenon ""original antigenic sin"".

Lots vaccines three four dose regimens. isn‚Äôt bizarre. We‚Äôll likely find ideal schedule long-term immunity course year unlike childhood immunizations. 

That doesn‚Äôt mean vaccines don‚Äôt work reduce spread. It‚Äôs basic everyone many people selfish it‚Äôs become chore whole.   Yeah cause there's massive spread outdoor events high vaccinated area. Thanks. 

If anyone else curious, crux video new variant don‚Äôt know much anything about. still wear mine stores outside ridiculous. thing me, similar age, really made affirm always get flu shots. Every time hear people say ""it's like flu"" covid get PTSD flash backs bad ""just flu"" is. cloth masks don‚Äôt stop spread viruses one. also block people‚Äôs faces, make hard breathe communicate, frankly insult people‚Äôs intelligence. idk

Third base.  Source stop fear mongering really helps prevent severe symptoms vaccination. prevent surge. one Agreed everything got LAX jfk lay flat seats, huge perk 5+ hr flight read initially ""put alien house"" impressed conspiracy theories evolved government openly using aliens recoup unpaid fines. Though awesome job. *Nothing* 100%  feel like little late. should‚Äôve happened first pandemic people first started ramping assholery. didn‚Äôt Trump office he‚Äôs direct cause emboldened assholes. Cutrent admin could‚Äôve done nearly year ago though.  ffs I'm getting sick shit .... people internet 'typos' right?? plebs Firstly correlation equal causation. UK amongst age 12 vast majority least 1 dose. think around 88% 12+ least 1 dose last time checked. deaths imagine would 18+ rather teens kids. vast majority adults UK leaves unvaccinated people left. 

Now know UK, well world lot people avoided going doctors covid etc plus imagine UK hospitals also backlog patients like countries due covid. many people going hospital etc naturally going end ton excess deaths like people major operations cancelled detecting cancer etc late.

And like said vast majority adults vaccinated naturally skew stats quite abit. example imagine 100 adults. vaccinate 90/100. 10/100 end dying 7/10 deaths vaccinated 3 unvaccinated. first glance looks like vaccine dropping dead closer look see there's 10 unvaccinated people scenario realistically many die. Conveniently boosters rolled mass‚Ä¶. never end.  Agreed. point CDC spending resources managing list.  Delta going spread even 100% vaccination rate, guess speed up, need better vaccines possible. don‚Äôt really care. I‚Äôve tried conversations them. yell rant don‚Äôt miss one bit. Prosecute what, stern warning [slap literal terrorists stormed capitol Jan 6, tried violently overthrow certified, democratic election given months years, makes *anyone* think people receive serious form punishment? think 9/11 know fuck around plane reason.

How treat service people huge indicator one‚Äôs character article talking civil fines, option government. also prosecute criminally -- get 20 years.

However, dangerous weapon used assaulting intimidating member attendant, individual shall imprisoned term years life.

There's worse place drunken asshole airplane. going filmed, everyone phone, criminal penalties serious. China entered chat. ‚ÄúStable virus doesn‚Äôt mutate.‚Äù admit basically know little still this. None. That's what's proven. unwilling. get vaccinated mask social distance. unwilling anti-vax.

It bad recommendation period. already known time vaccinated catch spread covid. countries demonstrated foolish drop masking even high vaccination rate. Yet proceeded warnings others so. mistake tell vaccinated need wear masks. mistake acknowledge policy reversed later. bad policy start. Baring sort catastrophic prognosis, see anything would offered maybe next fall US. We're trying get people get booster, already running significant resistance. Convincing people get another outside ""somewhat expected"" annual cycle would difficult.   They've saying while. understand CDC say 9 months ago.  far back records? Regarding SA data: seem like variant concern doubt. need data. That's happening Canada, right? USA would earlier approving vaccine, theory? remember mentioned Pfizer would send data month, done already?  care anymore, years none advice stopped anything, I'm going live normally get get it. boosters, masks, got 2 doses longer trust CDC whatsoever mRNA updated 30 days right? Lol like delta? need better vaccines ASAP, can‚Äôt wait get something new. mRNA fine need way present data would false.   agree you, line reasoning goes, ""If works salad bars work Covid,"" exactly rigorous science.  want get ride necessarily. New vaccines tweaked deployed matter weeks. got lot mileage vaccines developed almost two years ago.

We also know deadly mutations make new strain. know infectious fuck.

If top comment believed, R0 approaching 10. amount lockdowns, social distancing mask wearing halt that. yet shown. problem may vaccines administered. rush. develop administer them. Multiple dose vaccines normally short interval doses. Many months doses **minimum**. Generally told come back months second dose, that's come back. That's amount time wait least.

Because pandemic, rushed offer much protection soon possible. Let's see long protection booster lasts that's given reasonable interval prime(s). GOOD. agree take, airlines private companies right refuse service. no-masker asshat always charter plane fly somewhere. Fly list cover those. doubt it, pandemics don‚Äôt last longer 2-2.5 years travel Europe winter completely toast now? partner supposed go Italy January, trip booked recent surge. know much higher rate vaccination still going lockdown? (We‚Äôre fully vaccinated schedule get boosted FWIW.)

Ain't no-one containing face-masks two-meter distancing rules... full Wuhan measures contain that.

Yes, agree practices shitty, news unless living fucking rock. people bullies think rules apply them.   called vaccine, know  Cool ""Only 90-95% effective hospitalization"". aware that's good gonna get right ? There‚Äôs still couple parts country making people wear masks. think that's needed flight crew call penalties boarding/before flight doors close.

""Such federal crime"" sink in. There's label saying place lives people grown ignore background noise.

""Please fasten seat belts. friendly reminder, following flight attendants instructions interfering job considered federal crime fine high $37,000 potentially land jail. We'd also like remind DoJ zero tolerance policy effect now."" right... Besides heck matter something extra protect others? saw news piece thought back conversation: wondering rest country possibly catch there‚Äôs much interest here. Although hope they‚Äôre equally enthusiastic elsewhere. Aaand we're back!

At least good two months! ü•∞    Let‚Äôs fair, initially reduce transmission virus well. backtracked apparition delta variant, limiting mostly reducing chances hospitalisation death lot. personal gravity field however would stronger. Unpopular Solutiom:

1.Stop international flights 
 
2.Lockdown time whole earth 10 days 
 
Thats it, ends..but fine. college, old enough booster. everyone's vaccinated, worry. expect everyone live perpetual pandemic panic?

No. don't. expect people adjust new reality instead trying pretend still 2019. Wearing mask public settings panic. already common thing areas world even COVID. Getting vaccinated panic, we've annual flu shots decades COVID ends needing regular boosters see different. on. I'm saying anything eternal lockdown. I'm saying ""endemic"" mean ""it's forget it"", means ""we make adjustments reflect new reality"" 1.Stop international flights

2.Lockdown time whole earth 10 days

Thats it, ends..but  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Haha. forgot /s redditors downvote yeah. keeping people cruise boats aren‚Äôt territory. Yeah, that's studies excess deaths delta wave India showed.  ‚ÄúRight now‚Äù. ‚Äúright now‚Äù end?

The vaccine end game we‚Äôve reached  Businesses stay open, many mandates people socially distance.

Am done socially distancing, year, worth it. I'm high risk would rather get covid potentially side effects (up including death) go though again. hope so. Although don‚Äôt know prefer. guess wish virus away Aladin‚Äôs Genius ain‚Äôt granting right now. true. That's adjust new reality.  India reported covid deaths 300-400 percent? People think vaccinated throw mask garbage.....COVID clear misconception like done past. People want listen truth  I‚Äôm sure anyone thought going disappear. Smallpox considered eradicated 1980 still human disease designation world wide. US we‚Äôre considered polio free, still exists elsewhere. first vax available 1955? US declared free 1979. That‚Äôs 24 years.. think NZ citizens subsidise mean fully vaccinated still need hotel quarantine. Surely post vaccination world unvaccinated hotel quarantine pay cost. see reason vaccinated still need pay. Always give 110% think that‚Äôs I‚Äôm frustrated guess. hate sort standstill due unvaxxed.

My mom saying feels like lost three years school strange. volunteered first half kindergarten got shut year. field trips, virtual Christmas concert, birthday parties. wouldn‚Äôt bad normal masks hate end date Correct. need another study like ""Gold Standard"" one comments, tens thousands tests, vaccinated, boosted, unvaccinated, symptomatic asymptomatic, Delta variant included. Without data someone make recommendations based data have. Glad me. suspect people lottery mentality: sure, makes sense extreme majority save invest money rather buy lotto tickets week, would huge ROI handful win. covid vaccine, nearly guaranteed *some* kind reaction, even inconvenience waiting line. There's guarantee get covid symptomatic do, people would rather wait see win un-covid lottery rather sensible thing. support health care obese. Sorry, interested helping people help themselves. think parents would ultimately okay *really* wanted meet others. might concerned me, really themselves. 

They aren‚Äôt boosted yet. Neither yet. (We get third dose soon possible gotten reliable manner live.) 

If periodic covid vaccination (like flu vaccine) announced okay going out. fact encourage parents too. (Same applies pandemic subsided enough periodic vaccinations like flu vaccine happen covid.) Potentially, know yet. Vaccine will/may help lower probability hospitalization COVID &amp; know vaccine perform new upcoming variants next waves Shout biggest eff ever everyone refused anything help 2 weeks slow spread part pandemic. reason never forgive forget it. 

I keep wearing mask getting vaxxed. assholes around get vaxxed even wear mask keep others safe go thriving conspiracies right vent shoved throats. I'm it. ""The procedure every year, James."" I‚Äôm saying keep life zero risk. seems, me, counter intuitive take risk today essentially becomes zero next weeks due vaccination‚Ä¶ course highly dependent many circumstances. transmission still extremely high wouldn‚Äôt put kids around unvaccinated people living life normal, especially event (meal) obviously masks can‚Äôt worn. sure people problem parents wanting shield kids best abilities. Covid likely won‚Äôt kill kid, long covid real concern lasting cardiac, neurological, cognitive pulmonary changes concerning. meeting people know, great.

When go public, indoor setting, wear mask people know.  hammer much nail everything, there‚Äôs marketing there‚Äôs *reality*. Keep mind $1600 visiting short term. Citizens residents pay zero returning long term. 

As example I've used before, sister returned holiday paid. I'm sure NZ taxpayers subsidise holidays. returned full-time, would paid nothing.  Yeah really hate ‚Äúoh affecting young people much they‚Äôre missing development‚Äù argument. they‚Äôre not. Everything open. Go bar. They‚Äôre packed. Even state one still mask mandate; want go definitely can. 

It‚Äôs strawman argument they‚Äôre projecting act like virus somehow shutting life still.  gotten 4 spent 40 bucks (20 box 2). 


We used 2 son sick times negative. used 2 wife sick different time came positive. test Walgreens next day came negative. 


Bottom line tests garbage expensive. many morons man. depressing seeing comment like negative.
Thank God people I'm living wear masks time, even middle day park. Also 120 infections 7day average... half population US compressed country size California... biggest problem since start last year. current variants, probably low. 

If new variant arises deadly contagious delta, well, good luck üëç. Water wet said WHO.   know!!!.....this feels passive aggressive internet..... Awesome...atleast Vermont people sense...    right, please keep right thing..don't look others.

Only help family, one else... keep safe  said friends family members vaccinated, meaning none cancer patient. You‚Äôve definitely hit key factor here. many Americans act like bunch toddlers told use bathroom go bed. throwing tantrum someone told something basic don‚Äôt want to. believed past, changed mind. emotional judgement much risk assessment. least risky thing leave house, could easily however wish live manner.

I got shot wear mask I'm indoor public spaces potentially unvaccinated people literally nothing else, longer worth emotional cost. Right, people perception (created Govts), vaccinated nothing happen them...are fooled.  piece cloth. required wear clothes public. understand wearing one extra cloth end world.

But honestly, go ahead. wear one, pretend covid exist. get covid, you. agree. like saying change oil recommended schedule, may go hundred miles it‚Äôs ok best chances correct advice.  question long takes upgrade them, test distribute Jesus issue gas heating... claims ""more 100% fuel efficiency"" comes heating. Since heat pump flat lie. (E.g. achieve using ""fixed"" energy value fuel correct)

&amp;#x200B;

Your base values wrong mean % ""1/100th whole"" Mutations alone mean anything. changed really know way.  covid already &amp; win &amp; again... slowdown spread significantly though reduce risk new variants. cant quarantine people forcefully, mandate vaccines living part society. Congrats. learn, sometimes hard way. said anyones problem? 

Its basic reality wearing masks reduces spread infections. commonplace, end world. gets really bad. That‚Äôs I‚Äôve come terms with, end plywood caskets street corners. internet made people brainwashed echo chambers minds impossible change now. many people ICU‚Äôs said wished would gotten vaccine? diehard family members still mostly didn‚Äôt get even watching that. forgetting spread virus people may 65 pre existing conditions? It‚Äôs risk personally. /r/FuckTheS Spanish flu mutated less lethal strain, we're approaching two years Covid end sight.

Compared Sars MERS, Covid19 less lethal strain. got ~2 week asymptomatic spread, there's environmental pressures make less lethal. forever. Ooooooo‚Ä¶ upgrade! Guys, wanted advice. friend second vaccine jab. first one back May. wanted get second jab, would still effective left long? left heard scare stories second jab, decided it. thinks may need get second jab, may left long. idea happens got second jab whether would still work? Even you‚Äôre vaccinated, continue take precautions prevent becoming infected yourself, infecting someone else could die,‚Äù Tedros said. ‚ÄúThat means wearing mask, maintaining distance, avoiding crowds meeting others outside can, well-ventilated space inside.‚Äù

so meeting friend cancer patient, someone can't vaccinated, part.

Read article ask truly asking much. think entirely okay fully vaccinated inclination want get booster shots available want wear masks anymore.

If wear one go somewhere, will. to, won't. someone asks wear one even though I'm required, wear mask. I'm fully vaccinated plan getting booster FDA opened everyone. recently eligible week.

I'm also sick right thing nothing changes result. never convince people think COVID flu masks work even though proven work.

We wear masks rest lives keep cater unvaccinated necessarily problem obeying mask mandates... I'm tired. Yeah I‚Äôm getting kind sick ‚Äúwe‚Äôre situation Covid antivaxxers‚Äù line. Maine 81%/72% entire population partially/fully vaccinated. Yet they‚Äôre highest Covid numbers entire pandemic. Something else going isn‚Äôt antivaxxers. What's fair? am, high vaccination rate everything open. Social events resumed mostly except toddlers that's months away resolved now.

The catch show vaccination card wear mask certain settings. That's going us least another year IMO that's causing issue, really recommend seeking help. CT value != infectious viral load.

Even high school students understand now.  Jesus fucking christ, obvious still? even time?
I'm glad I'm US Japan instead. Except people wearing masks doesn‚Äôt hurt people, inverse true. It‚Äôs dumb comparison frankly.

Not mention, plenty people give others shit wearing masks. see problem this, right? definition you‚Äôre picking positive cases, get information infection risk reduction. problem they‚Äôre overpopulated? It‚Äôs new disease, take years build antibodies population.

The best limit worst effects bodies become accustomed it, better generation vaccines developed 1,5 2 millions deaths India delta lie then? 

Thanks, worried something awful happened there, glad misinformation media  Great, good you. Sounds like taking super safe approach. I‚Äôm relying vaccines passport back normal life, marketed. People assess risk tolerance proceed accordingly. clear information think ""directly negative wrong,"" particularly since said thread broadly consistent content article. hope hubby able get amazing take-out romantic picnic together something. I'm sorry everyone selfish help thing move along.   also important Russia Asian country like China. democracy leaders preventing it. democracy people know want it.

Asian people much submissive government. can't long term something total control like North Korea even China outside Asia. Either sh*t load money like Saudies corrupt literally everyone country top bottom, end current leader, rest fight power, exposing problems previous leaders letting people free.

It quite problematic push something masses want want use Stalin's level brutality. vaccine job(it's mainly reduce deaths hospital toll) enough seems think thinking mass though? Muscle would sense fat obese less dense? know paying wont move isnt cost pay hotel quarantine like rather expensive. Someone said like NZ$1,600 single person. Im sure many NZ citizens could easily afford especially family travelling cost would even higher then.  Depends. Completely? Unlikely. Partially, absolutely. Remember spike protein still needs able fit ace2 receptor vaccine targets. Case numbers hospitalization numbers comparable metrics. sure point semantical distinction is.

My point CDC looks case/hospitalization numbers applies guidance based that, can‚Äôt imagine anyone could find even remotely confusing pandemic. What‚Äôs yours? Uh, unsourced link unsourced charts doesn‚Äôt even agree statement. They‚Äôre seeing increase, mainly one province, provinces. strain already outcompeted Delta strain South Africa.


This simply isn‚Äôt true. may become true, isn‚Äôt remotely true point. Especially OPs article correct they‚Äôve found 100 cases far. 



 searched online better source mainly shit like Newsweek SkyNews etc.



I‚Äôll save panic someone expertise weighs in.


Until latest variant media fear monger over. See way kind get made hotel quarantine expensive since kind deters people travelling abroad pandemic importing covid. post vaccination world dont see vaccinated NZ citizens still need hotel quarantine. point hotel quarantine NZ citizens vaccinated yet. really matters. Infections happen, matter many.  ICU hospital capacity matters point.  low, vaccine job, want. Dude, I‚Äôm ya. got boosted wear mask public places. need friends family. need person them. flew thanksgiving, everyone boosted‚Ä¶ *here‚Äôs hoping don‚Äôt get COVID.*   fully vaccinated soon available so. I've kept social distancing ALWAYS wear mask I'm outside apartment. Yes, even bowling. 

I get asked lot recently I'm vaccinated still wear mask. else tell take everyone room jabs.

I always tell know, I'm asymptomatic carrier, know vaccinated yet. also hope may set good example reminder others wear masks. mask. hinder way. continue wear cautious?

That wear makeup much. mental disorder seeing reflection tells face vacation brain.    I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre comment, think comment exemplifies something interesting way receive information.

Just we‚Äôre fed whole thing doesn‚Äôt mean health professionals stop job informing us safest practices. Even information isn‚Äôt protect us, rather unvaccinated, many us couldn‚Äôt give shit anymore - it‚Äôs still job duty it.

It really seems like lot people don‚Äôt perceive actually is, rather someone ‚Äúdemanding‚Äù something, turn lash get angry health professionals delivering information suggesting best practices safety.  yeah mask ain't issue Vaccinated people countries vaccines available on-demand months longer obligation inconvenience protect willfully unvaccinated adults. Individuals fully vaccinated higher risk take additional precautions masking avoiding crowds, like diseases Covid. use example 75 year old pre-existing conditions, well, maybe hit crowded bar street beer home instead. risk averse risk greater. rocket science, people navigated world forever Covid-19 existed. 

Trying force healthy people mask distance years, avoid life experiences fun activities family friends might get mildly sick non-starter significant number Americans, would dare say large majority. person mentioned ""reality""... well, that's reality even people want hear it. I'm fully vaccinated boosted returned normal life. great, come join me. Happy Thanksgiving! I‚Äôm genuinely confused this, live area low infection rates even lower hospitalization rates, least 70% population vaccinated. young, healthy, vaccinated got booster shot. 

So lazy selfish wearing mask pop store? understand, low chance catching passing on. pass on, fault someone willingly unvaccinated catches it?

To fair understand concerns parents young children, hopefully situation improves children vaccinated. full vaccinated + booster, covid beginning pandemic one knew anything. Nothing worry point. Can‚Äôt run away covid-19 forever, unless wealthy enough hide away people. however career working people makes money. Get vaccinated move life. illness also circulating. Craziness, stupidity, ignorance three distinct things. somebody one mean others. FFS Covid toe comment sarcasm, I'm sure could interpreted way. He's still dumb using sarcasm hot topic, come people never Covid toe. Damn numbers scary look like france follow germany path pretty soon  wish didn‚Äôt this, sometimes think effects overblown.

Pretty much always This. NZ wants tourism industry eventually start allowing tourists without requirement self isolate. Plus vaccinated dont see reason even self isolate. get vaccine course isnt 100% effective get take test instead  pressure high enough move politically speaking. Vermont almost everyone masks grocery shopping. became norm habbit. Maskless outside, getting closer entrance, people instantly pull masks. Also noticed K95 around. Uhh.. news Alberta government. understand risk. decided risk small enough interior dinner, sister disagreed. Ever considered maybe worth risk? think density would actually lower you‚Äôre overweight fat less dense body parts. know thats one thing ive always wondered. people visas NZ left stranded abroad closed borders happened visa then? expire reapply visa extend it? Hey buddy, keyword healthy said already? school, work, fully vaxxed friends family.    three vaccines, afraid getting sick still? passing along others? Genuine question. People wildly different risk tolerances."
