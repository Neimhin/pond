0,2021-07-29," I've little personal story relate this. previously employer drug rehab middle nowhere, small desert town everyone knew everyone. first getting business despite court orders etc that's parking lot anybody saw car would know treatment. eventually moved shared parking lot medical building finally got clients needed. moral story- make discrete. Humans weird small towns like that, discretion part life. Well CRAP! trailing Delta Gamma right now... reputable source ptowns reputation Sex, drugs, rock n roll Ok get jokes holy shit arent people alarmed?? I’ve never seen virus take away sense smell taste cognitive ability. contagious seems like something insane here! 2021, smartphone everyone's pockets national database everyone's vaccination records get uploaded scannable QR code! Lockdown government response, community one. government jerking us around, even vaccinate everyone, people continents won’t. 

What’s end game? Put us house arrest, force people get vaccinated, what?

What actually believe government do? Declare give addictive control, release us back normal life? Why? 

You’re thrashing people, need consider policy. really citizens, government acting like government? Way go Alabama. You’re number 1! know research started 10 years ago SARS right ? Read prior comment. cdc said. me. random redditor
 

The cdc. want unbridled capitalism, govt small enough drown bathtub, told live lives. capitalist company wants set rules, want government intervene tell run companies. feel like I'm crazy pills trying wrap brain around conservative logic. wanted update say make sadly. hard reminder long fight covid still still lot work done. Stay safe everyone. Apparently CDC trying really push upcoming days weeks vaccinations, sign agree cant uproot everyone's lives second time go back pre-vaccine life. yes, anyone can. Even foreign tourist without US identities mostly concerned increased transmission delta variant.

That's precisely people saying? People saying sub insistent vaccines significantly reduce spread. believe me, go back thread cities bringing back mask mandate past 2 weeks. Atlanta added one yesterday, sure many people follow though latest info have: rule thumb whole time anything 7% cause concern. county US reached level week. Exactly. point enough enough. ""protect people"" much. point people made clear choice want vaccine. free, available, easy, etc. screw them. get get bother then!? no, think lkills you, would like that. Genocidal fucks watch CNN, rage it. 2 years behind vs. long term effects covid, mental anguish bringing home someone else family, death. sure... Let's send back know there.  85% efficacy vs virus R0 5-10 range ~50% vaccine rates really, really great. herd immunity end all, basically impossible actually reach herd immunity vaccine effective. basically almost entirely relying vaccine protect specifically point (assuming measures place), know you, usually feel comfortable playing Russian roulette die 83% time. anyone USA get vaxxed regardless status even tourist waltzed anywhere earth Clearly Washington Post care posting information labeled ""confidential preliminary data. subject change"". says I'm sure. case PowerPoint. found things interesting though. 

1) new information references surveillance data information Massachusetts outbreak. Without knowing data (e.g. symptomatic versus asymptomatic), tough know make it. guess we'll find tomorrow. 

2) still including outlier Israelei vaccine efficacy replicated elsewhere. 

3) graph showing transmissibility Delta variant compared ancestral strain assume pretty wide error bars around estimate Delta variant. axis showing fatality rate also logarithmic scale ... wonder many lay-people reading know interpret that.

4) modeling incidence assumes 75% 85% vaccine efficacy. Masking assumed 40 60% percent effective preventing transmission others 20 30% protecting infection .... bad news unvaccinated kids crowded schools really concerned cases amongst age groups. really need make clear masking works population level. get feeling individuals populations skeptical vaccines pharmaceutical industry might think masks offer protection do. Vaccines really sure way, sure be, protecting severe COVID. 

5) graphs reporting models four colors, three colors defined key. meaning fourth color pretty dramatic implications interpret models. 

6) clearly meant public release. I'm sure Washington Post published it, I'm sure expect non-specialists take away it. Even specialists, without room ask questions, PowerPoint limited value offer much anything new. Republican Party licking lips Yes, let's cause major inconvenience 99% planet 1%. Let's ask 99% line hours take time work go get tested. Let's cripple economy lockdowns 1%.

By way dont know many immunocompromised people would work sectors allow working home. fact work immunocompromised elderly people fortunate enough work home entirety pandemic. Also immunocompromised people years nasty influenza strains going around?

Its government run programs vulnerable people, putting onus general population easy way out.

People opinions like what's letting politicians easy. analysis bit misleading. many small hospitals COVID inpatients all, send larger regional systems.

As anecdotal reference, current COVID-19 inpatient count 30% max last Nov/Dec. hovering around week, positivity creeping (14% count things like pre-procedure tests). expect inpatient count probably increase difficult predict since essentially trying predict human behavior politics. Also recommends wearing masks regardless vaccination updated guidance 2021-22 school year, American Academy Pediatrics strongly recommends in-person learning urges eligible vaccinated protect COVID-19.*


*In addition vaccinations, AAP recommends layered approach make school safe students, teachers staff guidance here. That includes recommendation everyone older age 2 wear masks, regardless vaccination status. AAP also amplifies Centers Disease Control Prevention’s recommendations for building ventilation, testing, quarantining, cleaning disinfection updated guidance.* I'm surprised. saw news portuguese discord server lot (young) people saying hope Portugal might even hold back get vaccinated now, they're delusional point they're hoping reach herd immunity government forced same. 

This never happen (we're rich) fact global influence might hold back vaccination countries stupid ideas irks me. Pro-disease Policy They’re going get even FDA approves it. goalpost move enough say They're even lining things w/ Federal mandates set down. Biden already called Federal medical workers get inoculated. Corporations luxury living anti-vaxx world. many people get sick, become chronically ill, die newest variants going cascade bigger problems.

Experienced employees unable fulfill duties, junior employees either can't hired due payroll needs physical debilitation. mention global impacts supply chains really got taste past year. Bulk hospitalizations overtax healthcare system everything uninsured people unable pay sky high costs, health care professionals leaving droves due seeing colleagues die, again. Foreclosures evictions go industries can't keep w/ loss manpower/supply chain issues. majority people started staying home accord restaurants, airports, movies, etc., hits youth even harder that's going go right back effect.

Anti-vaxxers painted corner one. They've pushed narrative far, period time Head State US backing them, right succumbed disease horrific fashion. True form, they're starting slowly get vaccinated themselves, fact they're starting secret avoid scandal social circles craziest part whole thing. Yeah, say, big holdouts vaccine generally people would worry immigration status. point declare domestic terrorist? lost aunt hours ago, due covid. Please everyone get vaccinated. really worth losing life. sweetest soul I'm really, really going miss her. Fuck. can’t sleep night worrying unvaccinated kid big rise concentrated heavily young people, significant proportion least 1 dose vaccine. got Covid first dose really mild (21 years old). end, higher vaccination rates maybe new Push medical reform? trust vaccine cards though? issues people faking them?

I'm still annoyed frustrated digital way verify! anyone really surprised? lowest vaccination rate country. even know flu virus. would expect nothing less Bible Belt. lack individual thought, constant strive twist everything “Preacher Chuck” says biblical. It’s insane. heard stores visited saw first hand absolutely amazed. 

“Sunday Service” nothing rock concert excuse rid kids hours socialize. good friend mine lives Tennessee “pastor” tested positive Covid. He’s still working church, still planning “service”. man crazy honestly believes getting Covid better immunity took vaccine. Last weeks sermon “having faith Jesus, masks”

Hmm.. maybe registered CDC. rube. makes feel better, first doses increasing. Dumb people like make laugh US, likely gunfights law enforcement true lockdown attempted.

There really many scenarios could spin positive light government effectively inciting violence (certainly letting virus run unchecked), even violent folk far right. dare you... No, double-dog dare you! could kept before, asking states positive tests. stopped requiring states report data positive Covid vaccinated unless hospitalized die. Everything short hospitalization reflected numbers. still report positive cases unvaccinated people even asymptomatic. Document link: little strange quickly things went ""we're sure pass Covid vaxxed"" ""masks vaxxed!"" Almost using promise masks carrot vaccination maybe ""wait see"" approach would've prudent. 

They're right thing now, I'm tired reactive instead preemptive. Even catch half positives, that's still substantial reduction Thanks this! Looks like guy gone much self loathing years he's completely numb shame decency. told someone vaccinations hinder transmission way back December, people would accepted it. trials, research inclusive whether vaccines hinder transmissions Thank you. cannot believe hours later, post still up. disagree.

Naw, say dump data let world sort it... least truth come way. Article text:

The Delta variant much contagious, likely break protections afforded vaccines may cause severe disease known versions virus, according internal presentation circulated within Centers Disease Control Prevention.

Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, director agency, acknowledged Tuesday vaccinated people so-called breakthrough infections Delta variant carry much virus nose throat unvaccinated people, may spread readily, less often.

But internal document lays broader even grimmer view variant.

The Delta variant transmissible viruses cause MERS, SARS, Ebola, common cold, seasonal flu smallpox, contagious chickenpox, according document, copy obtained New York Times.

The immediate next step agency “acknowledge war changed,” document said. contents first reported Washington Post Thursday evening. document’s tone reflects alarm among C.D.C. scientists Delta’s spread across country, said federal official seen research described document. agency expected publish additional data variant Friday. “The C.D.C. concerned data coming Delta serious threat requires action now,” official said.

There 71,000 new cases per day average United States, Thursday. new data suggest vaccinated people spreading virus contributing numbers — although probably far lesser degree unvaccinated.

Dr. Walensky called transmission vaccinated people rare event, scientists suggested may common thought. agency’s new masking guidelines vaccinated people, introduced Tuesday, based information presented document. C.D.C. recommended vaccinated people wear masks indoors public settings communities high transmission virus.

But internal document hints even recommendation may go far enough. “Given higher transmissibility current vaccine coverage, universal masking essential,” document said.

The agency’s data suggest people weak immune systems wear masks even places high transmission virus. vaccinated Americans contact young children, older adults, otherwise vulnerable people.

There roughly 35,000 symptomatic infections per week among 162 million vaccinated Americans, according data collected C.D.C. July 24 cited internal presentation. agency track mild asymptomatic infections, actual incidence may higher.

Infection Delta variant produces virus amounts airways tenfold higher seen people infected Alpha variant, also highly contagious, document noted.

The amount virus person infected Delta thousandfold seen people infected original version virus, according one recent study.

The C.D.C. document relies data multiple studies, including analysis recent outbreak Provincetown, Mass., began town’s Fourth July festivities. Thursday, cluster grown 882 cases. 74 percent vaccinated, local health officials said.

Detailed analysis spread cases showed people infected Delta carry enormous amounts virus nose throat, regardless vaccination status, according C.D.C. document.

“This one impressive examples citizen science seen,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, infectious disease specialist Bellevue Hospital Center New York. “The people involved Provincetown outbreak meticulous making lists contacts exposures.”

Infection Delta variant may likely lead severe illness, document noted. Studies Canada Scotland found people infected variant likely hospitalized, research Singapore indicated likely require oxygen.

Still, C.D.C.’s figures show vaccines highly effective preventing serious illness, hospitalization death vaccinated people, experts said.

“Overall, Delta troubling variant already knew was,” said John Moore, virologist Weill Cornell Medicine New York. “But sky isn’t falling vaccination still protects strongly worse outcomes.” Wild. God ready Iceland, exactly? Honestly I’d even go far say it’s lost cause. Try giving couple hundred dollars first, let deal consequences actions. Darwinism finest, smart strong survive. Looks like might rationing care soon. never broke barrier last January almost certain spots. Thank goodness ER, last several days must horrible nonetheless.

If consolation, think would happened vaccinated? could died, least got put ventilator ECMO. That's say would happened alternate world, could saved even severe case death. THANK YOU. fucking confused wording Yeah going like guy here. Please remember diseases going around right now! came back vengeance summer!  process communicating science messy though. idea seems hard experts leading governments communicate way everyone understands said. 

For example, Canada mixed matched vaccines (I got 1 pfizer 1 moderna). we're this, comes says mix match. hehe... wtf? gov responded saying fine really mean it. 

so canadians think mixing matching now? haha... know think. one ever clarified things more, left everyone confused right answer was. 

The communication science gets hard F countries. Yes! world, especially, India Israel warning us Delta months now. Yet, took long USA/CDC listen. 

COVID-19 global pandemic, even vaxxed, might new variant able overcome vaccine world protected. need think comprehensive plan goes beyond vaccines. Ofc vaccine manufacturers make sound like vaccine end evolving virus, that's clearly good idea. 

Our government needs prioritize us companies want ""reopen economy"" forcing people back grey boxes we've shown jobs home 18 months. letting vaccine companies drive narrative. AL finally leading nation something besides incest lynchings die 8 years That's true, discount benefits getting vaxxed. could mean difference minor sniffle tube windpipe, still need many vaccinations possible could think worse things happen society. give strategy working great delta. 10% vaccinated year pain, assuming nothing worse delta emerges.

Secondly, NJ's case fatality rate 2.57%, Plenty countries CFRs higher that: High CFR real question is, would lie stats? play progress states made thanks vaccination efforts? Pfizer already recommended it, last week so. need approval. fact US bought another 500 million doses says administration already predicting this. waiting approval. complex, also breaks glitches many complex ways. complexity = failure modes.

Ummm serious charge. evidence CDC massively downplaying hospitalization fully vaccinated? ""sing ya'll!    SWEET HOME \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" mentioned duration may issue israel released Health Ministry last week suggested people vaccinated January 16% protection infection now, vaccinated April, effectiveness 75%.

Theres also concerns analysts have warned figures vaccine effectiveness prone major inaccuracies because range factors, including questions whether accurate data infection levels among non-vaccinated, vital stats. British data indicates Israeli studies may overstating case. Same. Solidarity that. Wow, aren’t sympathetic. I'm trying wrap head around that. really need going hospital. Doctors really going want study shit you.   Yep. 100% Euros 70% adults vaccinated. would think exactly reason people would inclined get vaccinated, avoid receiving huge hospital bill potential Covid treatment. TL;DR There's aspect that--I think CDC really fucked things early saying masks work try hoard healthcare workers, lot whipsawing science carried real time. 

The delta variant really different beast first widespread COVID variant, still learning it. Unfortunately, process science messy. Flu Lol, try going skydiving bible parachute. Anyone know Novavax vaccine might approved become widely available? family member says might get becomes available, trust mRNA vaccines (for whatever reason). I'm hoping might persuaded actually get vaccinated Novavax becomes option him.  agree. CDC botched messaging jump. say someone “followed science” took socially distancing seriously. mask issue March/April 2020 obvious attempt keep masks frontline healthcare workers. long hesitation acknowledge airborne transmission for… whatever reason?? abrupt mask-free policy fully vaccinated individuals May 2021 obvious attempt encourage vax hesitant people get shots. now, anyone following start clocking happening India/UK delta variant, breakthrough cases months. It’s incredibly frustrating. Even get infected post vaccine, still infection other, gave immune system huge leg fighting it.

There likely way less chance getting long COVID like issues vaccinated, 0% chance. Same, siblings, friends, vaccinated don’t think dad says doesn’t care gets covid. He’s believer Fox News ew. hate living Alabama wish lived different state again. 

I extended family member covid siblings family may get (I hope 2 year old) they’re vaccinated. wish people would stop exposing sick ass selves innocents. I've seen lot talk paying people get vaccine. feel like point announce date November gonna start charging $250 it. really fair poor people feel like people understood incredible value shot provides financial level might realize good free compared hospital bills. Yikes land said ""give liberty give death"" dumbasses chose real, friends like ""why always shitting Texas"" I'm like, fucking garbage. least I'm Austin fuck's sake, wish Abbott would drop dead breakthrough COVID infection already. also got people vaccinated. Initially save started vaccinated 40. see, know that.  Honestly planes gross, I’ll keep mask vaxxed. fucking obvious entire time. Much appreciated. still felt like absolute hell, didn’t get sleep past almost 48 hours account bloodwork chest X-rays right got 3am, Covid swab, putting oxygen taking blood could check clotting, sticking IV infusion missing vein first time shaking much freezing hospital gown without blanket fever didn’t ppe gear wasn’t given one.

Even *masks themselves* may help, effective *mask mandates*? That's entirely different question.

Forgive skeptical. example, numerous factors seem likely stymie effectiveness, including: 1) unvaccinated (who likely spread COVID) likely simply ignore mandates; 2) people still plenty high-risk activities indoors (e.g., eating indoors maskless); 3) extent folks wear masks, lots wear ill-fitting cloth masks wear masks incorrectly, -- better nothing -- can't imagine provides much protection immunocompromised given damn infectious Delta is.

Finally, must remember mask mandates -- lowish cost intervention individual level -- costless, particularly costs aggregated across hundreds millions people. long must ask people this, particularly miracle vaccine exists close eliminates risk death/hospitalization vast majority people take it?

But please forget reason misinformation propagated anti-mask, anti-vaxx crowd. Make mistake, deserve every ounce blame that's heaped upon them. hospitalization rates low enough don’t need worry medical collapse anymore.

In area, ICU capacity almost back 100% utilized early delta wave far. Half population vaccinated helps ton, delta nearly twice infectious could mean runs unvaxed population *just fast* original would without data shows vaccines don’t prevent catching covid don’t prevent spreading it.

This blatantly untrue. don’t *guarantee* won’t catch/spread much original strain, still significantly reduce chances thus also reduce risk others can’t vaccinated legitimate reasons.

Don't worry, I'll wait. idea seems hard experts leading governments communicate way everyone understands said. 

Because economy consultants step in. personal attack part understanding sympathetic way interacting? hard enough. Unvaxxed everyday life impossible get vaccine. Total number cases also misleading, number kids show enough symptoms get tested going vastly less number kids caught virus asymptomatic. top looks like decent number get approved and/or required employer.

Most people maybe, people always find way get vaccinated. France, business also malls, trains etc require vaccinated (you show ""health pass"") anti-vax prefer fired vaccinated.

Cool, entire world vaccinated variants beating vaccines still threat matter happens USA showed small graph changes cases, absolute numbers, talking UK, EU US said numbers high. remember specifically said numbers rising yesterday 7-day moving

This context ""vaccine passports"" could 100%, think it'd make big difference. According Google, Singapore's population 74.8% vaccinated. 55.4% fully vaccinated, 19.4% least one shot. breakthrough cases expected, CDC briefing states, probably rise proportion cases many people vaccinated now. echoes data seen studies countries, including highly vaccinated Singapore, 75 percent new infections reportedly occur people partially fully coronavirus stay. really need shift toward goal preventing serious disease disability medical consequences, worry every virus detected somebody’s nose,” Neuzil said. “It’s hard do, think become comfortable coronavirus going away.”

it get way worse… great

I would panic finding. 

* 1437 total workers 
* 39 breakthrough infections detected (~2.7% total)
* 8 reporting symptoms lasting longer six weeks (~19% infections, 0.6% total)

The NEJM article specifically state age health history 8 ""long-haul"" persons were, I'd willing bet they're older side somewhat compromised immune systems. 

Bottom line: young, healthy, fully vaccinated? Green light. It’s value***(1 + growthrate)^time. starting infection percentage 5% it’s growing rate 7% every day, 10 days it’s 5***(1 + 0.07)^10 = 9.8% nearly double.

But comment 7% misplaced, don’t conflate current positivity rate growth rate. positivity rate 21.5%, article says nothing growth rate. 1 5 people tested positive, alone says nothing many expect test positive next week. Nope. wearing mask again. everyone know fully vaccinated therefore longer care virus. care new waves. Even ignoring manner cases falling strange. Herd immunity switch either off, reaching lead gradual plateau fall. rapid decline cases strange something 100% attributed herd immunity. Funny houndred cases 8.5million city China called ravaged metropolitan areas would hope get that. USA union states. EU union countries. much less 17 times. uk data suggests like 10 times less likely... could even lower less likely symptomatic go testing.

It's hugely effective. Delta massively infectious. alpha caused surges distancing lockdowns, variant twice infectious people anything? Well, spread even majority people vaccinated. Hit 90 percent plus population might change. Hit 95 percent elderly youve largely solved serious illness death portion.

Nowhere us done former. Quite areas done latter.  means immune system already prepared fight virus. It’s trained already, that’s whole point, vaccines work.

It means body shut new infection faster, serious damage. 

If would vaccinated, body would spend time learning fight it, losing valuable time. 

Besides reasons, virus killed 50% people 50, everyone 50 didn’t notice. try limit spread? Fake called pastors. sole purpose fleece gullible church members see nothing wrong extra-cautious around unvaxxed children outbreak like one we're experiencing.

But adults chose get vaxxed? Screw that. lift finger protect them. Thanks paywall, informative will. Fucking rednecks lol haven’t able buy *small* authentic n95 masks. sources find still selling medical facilities. masks Bona Fide big. course are. long choose want Well, 100% well long COVID get even stuck home 24/7. Many applaud decision result death. Vaccines never able stop catching virus. shield stops catching it. make immune system already ""primed"" deal *do* catch it. Hopefully, thanks vaccine, immune system clear virus without ever knowing actually (and time does).

Naturally lower transmissability shedding virus *much* shorter time immune system promptly kills off. stand reason virus spreads ""as easily thorugh vaccinated population easily unvaccinated"", vaccinated people coughing place, vaccinated people shedding virus *very* short period time (compared unvaccinated might couple weeks more).  Wear N95 mask everywhere go. point, obvious vaccines gonna solve problem...because many assholes can't vaccinate every man animal there. Let's see still 100% well 3 years time last year visiting grandmother. 

Visiting California’s locked shut policies well majority people wearing masks EVERYWHERE to.. 

Alabama. every store went inside of, mask worn own. (School big exception, wore there) 

Luckily grandmother made everyone watches wear them, felt better well being. 

But hit mainly Harley Davidson trying drop grandfather’s bike worked on, event there, around 40+ people, nobody one on. moron's stupid policy going get people killed. Media really interested reporting science accurately, clickbait potential much work. Better compare apples oranges dogs blimps let reader figure out.

Hmmmmm, realize many immune comprised immune suppressed aren’t worried covid right. worried cold, flu, uti, real virus infection. know vaccines aren’t even close effective stop spreading covid. masking symptoms protecting yourself. yeah. argument holds little weight. aren’t others. Get narrative outta mind. get back society. truly immune compromised worrying about. don’t trust anyway, cause again, it’s covid worry about. Nice try Permanent lockdown, maybe Hermits Percentage positive also fallen pretty significantly well last days suggesting due less people taking tests. problem 

It needs based people offered approved vaccine Long-term lockdowns vaccinations. would pick vaccinations. worry florida great care DeSantis. He's suppressing much bad news make everything look nice. People really stupid. CDC reasonably corrected aerosol transmission became known - therefore people angry?

Also masks really help ""protect"" unless working infected people wearing face shield way common man would understand. reduce chance transmission (considerably) neither replace keeping distance staying home. common man would wear mask \_instead\_ both.

Somehow, think that's mean. Quick recap joining us:

* Delta ( bad )
* Vaccines ( good )
* masks ( use )
* large crowds ( use caution )
* panic ( )

You stay safe. Shocker Me, too. Six weeks Covid symptoms. Two strep one regular flu test negative. negative, they're negative. Calm down. sicknesses world Covid.  thing kids. virtual last year planning going back school three weeks. I'm sure we're going do. district still released kind safety plan anything. Guess comes experience cape cod outbreak. Delta variant seems changing things. Nothing really new - another vaccine another disease. sure current rules are, brat father (Air Force) get barrage vaccines. know get paid thank you, well. 3 yo got January yet didn’t pass me, husband 4 mo old. literally symptoms wouldn’t even known didn’t get tested. Anyone else lost what’s going on?

Nope. defer CDC Guidelines. really hope right, last told needed vaccinated. really care masks, damn well know stop there. surprise anyone? Let ""freedom"" run course, means rest us free idiots. way ACA written makes difficult charge behaviors tobacco use. think Congress would actually need pass amendment even make legal. 

I'm aware whether would prevent going way offering discounts vaccinated instead. Covid Tide Yeah. im scared anything related covid lose ability read write. Especially since tend read fairly difficult texts. Itd mean losing enjoyable thing life. would left then? Ugh. solid snake write document? That's important question got [this new data comprehension something run home to, go. 19%. 
 
This mostly previous variants way. Several nurse friends become increasingly stressed past week. I'm group chat they've said they've seen alarming amount vaccinated individuals come hospital quite sick. know many ""an alarming amount"" since given numbers, enough they're worried safety despite fully vaccinated. Several work hospital Dallas one Austin claim patients coming in. know anecdotal like two separate hospitals I'm sure like across states, atleast south still vaccine hesitancy. amount unvaccinated hospitals still far outweigh amount vaccinated however.

I think right officals weary report numbers fear may cause unvaccinated double beliefs. simultaneously saying ""you can't control me!"" Honestly let people kill they’ll die off? value putting Denmark, Portugal Bulgaria figure beyond me.

You could say Massachusetts vs. Mississippi US well. meant *like kn95 masks"" told could investigate further, city’s Department Environmental Protection initially offered additional funding support efforts. “The city officials basically told us wanted kind surveillance rats would ourselves,” Dr. Marc Johnson, virologist University Missouri, wrote June 9 email obtained open-records request Documenting COVID-19 project. “They zero willingness help explore potential public health risk.”

You find anything New York, even previously unseen mutations. That’s still millions sick people that’s good point— actually upon looking data again, seems like 74% number smaller denominator positive cases permanent residents only, it’s full ~800 positives. way even less information assumed. anyway, though I’d guess vaccination rate “MA residents visiting Ptown” still quite high, you’re right may *as* high. CDC website lag behind everything else. developing situation. actions speaking louder words me. nah guidance reports internal documents imply something else going on. We'll know soon, CDC political organization cautious, actually sharing everything. They're running processes take time.

I agree vaccines still effective, effective stopping transmission know hospitalizations yet literally tested scale first time, right now. protection, lot protection, slightly reduced Sorry keeps going. awful. Butt putting head sand change anything.

Doing things last year try eradicate Covid change anything. Roll Tide! keeping kids kf94 (like know masks) masks protect school even kids adults around wearing them? True true. never caught flu. couple colds life. definitely think it’s doable never get Covid, hope never it. thing noticed cases eventually level drop countries like India UK Delta variant widespread strain. expect happen US fairly soon? exponential growth neither we. covid rate vaccination rate?Either seems right. people luck antihistamines niacin. Alabama mutation yet? talking friend outside, within six feet 15 minutes. I'm vaccinated, mentioned wife kids high fevers coughs. sounds like kids swab tested brought doctor, wife drive-thru self swab (PCR believe), negative Covid. feel nervous still, though said summer cold. Would guys take precaution? got 3rd dose Pfizer Monday week. I’m type-1 diabetic, wife said would good idea since I’m considered “high risk”. Covid increased sense smell...possibly also dried nose/mouth/eyes. still dark many symptoms. Alabama resident, it’s incredibly frustrating see this. constantly argue people getting vaccine. I’ve reached point can’t feel bad people anymore, they’ve chance there’s plenty research make decision. it’s bc don’t want to. stage pandemic part problem you’re allowing cousin remain unvaccinated. need confrontational this. can’t let go, blew yelled told get vaccinated. Every unvaccinated person someone close that’s vaccinated. It’s time step put pressure. Make uncomfortable make clear they’re wrong don’t approve it. That’s pretty much exactly happened UK, opinion. wouldn’t vote either, point out, bar low. look last presidential primaries, anyone runs. fact would argue Abbott qualified president Trump ever was, actual experience governing. might make dangerous president Trump was, extremist policies + competence.

Abbott touting call Texas miracle, growth Texas due companies moving HQ’s TX expensive coastal states tax breaks. hiding TX budget still strongly relies dying oil gas industry result school budgets gutted. hey, ignorant populace seems vote Republican, it’s double win!  they’d saying statement even weren’t true. Fuck CDC. known Delta variant months, seen done countries. wait actually something it? already heading towards peak hospitals south already near capacity? 

If response time new variants utterly completely fucked. CDC response… wear cloth mask… virus infectious chickenpox… complete bullshit. 

A proper response would need avoid indoor crowded spaces yesterday especially elderly vulnerable need go need wear higher quality masks. No, decision lift restrictions, population isn’t fully vaccinated new variant transmissible vaccinated. pretending oblivious.  CDC says area need masks. I'll follow science this, thank you.

[Still better NY may maybe less That's do.  double get outflanked right. Good, fuck'em... husband’s job gave everyone full paid day go get vaccine quite ago. 👍🏼 IMPORTANT POINT: 2% points: 25 vs 23. That’s statistically minuscule. Bet second study finds difference. It’s type crowd. source pediatric case hospitalization numbers? &lt;12 12-17 yos? charts liked, looks like number cases &lt;12 population still small.

Don't get wrong - cautious kids; still mask indoors, eat restaurants. obviously going clubs bars, school biggest risk right now. terms Covid, think important weigh relative risk Covid potential harm mental state. original context this? Another person said W quote referring to? Covid old quote works? nonsense executive orders. Shit needs go away True, thats mostly Massachusetts NYC first get slammed enough tests test anybody, really uderstood spread, knew treat it. 

COVID tore nursing homes Northeast CDC still saying ""regular people need masks"" ""you get tested got back China Italy"". It’s getting increasingly hard public health discussions apolitical one political party completely disregarding public health recommendations. nbers fudged I'm Christian, churchgoer volunteer FL. cherish church family found several great friends community. leadership stays politics. still super difficult pill swallow large swath around play politics science reason, politics people game. 

I'm quite sure Jesus would encouraged people get protected illness protect neighbor, anything. I'm perplexed discouraged well. executive pastor comes medical background, pro precautions whole pandemic, wish would encouraging people least consult doctors listen getting vaccine. Right large portion volunteers staff sick Delta variant. I'm going pulling back going person bit. Never, would seem.  one going step human rights. worked 2 year technical college nursing program. full hard working, single parents, taking night classes program also full people bussing tables never would gotten regular 4 year college. traditional college everyone, like people bad grades 900 SATs. thought actually great proof judge someone go something important nursing shit went down. incorrect, explicitly slides say. Direct link slides 

Slide 17 headline: “Delta variant vaccine breakthrough cases may transmissible unvaccinated cases”

Slide 22 summary: “Breakthrough infections may transmissible unvaccinated cases” People need realize CDC used political tool. There’s grand conspiracy CDC still vital positive thing, it’s naive think really don’t answer Executive branch.  
 
Also, people seem forgotten FDA underfunded, industry-infiltrated shit show Covid hasn’t changed. people move promise low taxes deregulation getting paid for. biggest driver spread historically Facebook News…those consumers skew older happened idea private companies freedom please? respect that. emphasized decision based kids impacted. kids getting sick Covid continues get vaccine really seems like care about. 

From one sisters, 15 months ago, People die everyday, cares. 

For anti Vax non believers.

I care, dont wanna die F... Coronavirus. Every time get coronavirus infection, end bed week... shit (covid-19) gonna kill me. Shame not, theres nothing stopping vacced ppl partys day since 18 month. deserved ignore anyone telling stay home

Vacced ppl fine anyway even catch it, unvacced ppl shouldnt party, fault catch unvacced dying. mask mandate schools entirely unvacinated population + delta varrient infectious chickenpox? could possibly go wrong guys?!

Something something freedom! /s think I’m going hang city hall cough non stop claim COVID. 

🤷🏻‍♂️ Well... know many infections UK, lot. Easily 1.5 million official cases since Delta became dominant variant country half year since tracking it. People 20 hospitalized dying (there may individual cases, exceedingly rare). 


To fair, child specific conditions make vulnerable others age group, I'm sure parent know. I'm speaking general population level terms. Uh oh, stereotypical idiot state something demonstrates stereotypical idiots card issued vaccination though right? Isn’t nationwide vaccine tracking purposes. Fixed: sir Alabama:

**~~step~~brother gas entered chat** Ah American politics. could never backfire. Arizona too. kids start school Monday masks aren’t required smh. Utter nonsense. Public spaces huge caveat may ignore things like private residences. mean probably? Anyone see end up. Great twitter thread here: We're number one! well frankly care

If really care continue reply. mom moved Arizona twenty years ago married biker. said believed “freedom” happy AZ didn’t mandate helmets. 

He died pandemic injuries resulting motorcycle accident left partially paralyzed minor brain damage. voted Trump.

The moral tale that, yes, people would rather die unnecessarily give believe liberties. this?

Let's get vaccinated we'll see ticket out.

I imagine sitting 97% vaccination rate among eligible whole Delta variant thing would played lot differently. upvote, it’s older meme boy check Thanks! Except complete nutjob Texas gonna Texas Texans dead. guy would make great Champion Nurgle 40k universe. data show happen cases go again, bound happen.

Also, maybe let people make informed decision decide themselves, instead telling *should* worried about? thought. problem is, federal judge likely strike law down. highly conservative Court Appeals uphold it. it'll go Supreme Court take awhile. Arkansas much time. Abbot colossal asshole. Literally nothing would likely saved lives, no… dickwad decides show make things worse. literally hate GOP voters keep self serving assholes in-charge. March 2020 again. Buy N95s! Home Depot still them. literally never buy concessions Broadway shows reason. can't stomach price doubt could even millionaire. disclaimer, think definitely big step right direction, extent actually mandate vaccines without full FDA approval? charge I’d sign law prohibits cities. Also, upticks infection rates usually trigger restrictions. Lower rates lead lower restrictions.  Yea couple good things avoid. Also rest us ambulances get turned away sent hospitals farther away, rest us issues large small might deal surgeries cancelled preventative care gets missed early diagnosis gets missed people die things completely related covid timing meant needed medical care hospitals care teams available dealing covid. saying 70% whole state vaccinated, case numbers quite low. Deaths rising either crazy always ones least suspect. would much better governor all. Texas.  totally useless. chin diapers help expedite natural herd immunity possible death want get vaccinated.
Meanwhile vaccinated people suffer severe symptoms unvaccinated people have. Cherry picking infers choice made someone blindly parroting verbal pablum fed them. deaths per capita? Literally, everyone dying Covid FACT fatality rate y’all’s super star delta lower original virus is. continue preach BB pleases Nurgle. opening line inaccurate: 

""We close conquering COVID-19.""

Um, much world vaccinated? Absolutely anti-vaxxers. Thinking incident through, I’m pretty sure study probably centered Provincetown (the article mentions large events Barnstable County I, gay, infer means), suspect crowd probably mostly vaccinated. make sense population becomes vaccinated, larger proportion vaxxed get infected.

That’s based inferences crowd though.  course freedom death thing him.  ""Is *really* hard wear mask? *I* even notice on. *We already require people wear clothes, different?*

And completely apoplectic say ""well, yeah, is."" fine two weeks, getting pretty old time December rolled around, huge surge vaccines available yet, well worth then.

But now, year half later? *Nah.*

If mask offered additional meaningful protection, maybe I'd look differently. I'm vaccinated, additional protection would give meaningless. inconvenience absolutely nothing me.

These people act like masking absolutely zero downsides, flat wrong. Comparing wearing mask wearing shirt laughable. Like yeah, I'm sure easy wear mask get groceries delivered, work home, never leave house. bet 2020 fuckin' breeze you, wonder want go back it.

If still feel unsafe, mind wearing mask, fucking *great*. M95 masks protect wearer even nobody else wearing one, strap one *mind fucking business*. antivaxxers care about, me.  Fuck that, order groceries meds contactless delivery. thing leave house life limb emergency. really mutating wrong way. States, need worse effects people, spread easily. Hopefully repercussions increase people get vaccinated stop endangering everyone increasing odds breakthrough variant.   What’s point? can’t measure effectiveness can’t compare results unvaccinated group. majority people vaccinated. Similar headline saw weeks ago stating 40% hospitalizations among fully vaxxed! Completely neglecting fact population highly vaccinated, course, eventually, you’re going see people hospitalized fully vaccinated. What’s improved effect vaccines entire community, data points vaccines taking steam COVID. 

Also, immunology way complex you’re giving credit for. suggest read debate that’s going among experts regarding study. mRNA “vaccine”. It’s designed lessen symptoms cytokine storm, help immune system fight it. Excellent context! Thanks sharing. know older relatives 55+ prefer still go shop, probably ""normal"" experience. someone gotten used amazon prime now, grocery pickup etc past years, new normal.  problem they're acting like toddlers. tell kid can't something protection, want even more. true vaccines masks. tell people wear masks get vaccinated protect everyone, including themselves. *telling them* problem, makes get defensive stamp feet.

If come conclusion ""on own"", think they're bullied libs, like told do/not something parents. pisses think calling stupid know better. get irrational refuse purely grounds want they're told. gonna charge cousin that? Lol ""Long covid"" treated bizarre novel thing Covid does, not. Viral infections sorts mess take long time recover from, true flu. especially true illness severe. common well understood. Covid severe flu one existing immunity, reasonable expect see long term symptoms body recovers damage (or 100%).

Basically, there's reason expect functional vaccines also protect ""long covid."" virus can't damage immune system successfully fighting it. mean there’s also good chance delta peak burn quickly like UK India. part Texan here. aren't. Masks becoming exceedingly rare. Almost nobody job wears despite still new covid cases here. see almost zero masks store/gas station/wherever. Nope! That’s works. author post said proved vaccines get integrated genome. proof. said proved Bigfoot doesn’t exist you’d probably ask show work rather asking anyone says I’m full shit independently prove Bigfoot exists. saying there’s proof mRNA vaccines don’t integrate (especially paper), saying do. can’t understand difference it’s problem, mine. Obviously mods agreed took post down. Sounds great...I got notified conference supposed attend Austin September canceled thousand people coming state can't get handle Covid.

That fully YOU! think meant one could muster real argument 😜 prohibit private businesses operating TX mandating masks? fool.  turn Texas blue yet briefly skimmed article without knowing many people 882 “those living Massachusetts” 74% useless statistic. example 882, 400 living Massachusetts would 300 people fully vaccinated coughs virus. hand 32 882 living Massachusetts number would 24 people instead 300 full vaccinated caught virus. days wish lived Texas. 

Honestly awesome, national.

Any American wanting vaccine, it. risk get it, oh fucking well. there's concerted effort prolong ordeal. Oh yeah. family accidentally ended part gay pride parade got lost trying drive us beach cellphones big. Somewhat traumatic everyone assume mom partner. Gov Brian Kemp soon too. He's already blasting Atlanta mayor mandating masks indoors.
Oh, Governor's Mansion closed since March 2020. think completely irresponsible non-scientist make types decisions. reason still pandemic. Thanks buddy. interesting it’s time vote Abbot out.

LOL. Republicans would rather die vote black-people party. Republicans big gov. Texan I'd like vocalize guy fucking idiot. ""Dont like it, get Texas"" - Texas republicans.

&amp;#x200B;

They cant make good argument this. virus spread easily even vaccinated.. still mutate? Like even community everyone vaccinated secede state?  cash lotteries (CCLs) provide people opportunities win monetary prizes make specific behavioral changes. conduct case study Ohio's Vax-A-Million initiative, first CCL targeting COVID-19 vaccinations. Forming synthetic control states, find Ohio’s incentive scheme increases vaccinated share state population 1.5 percent (0.7 pp), costing sixty-eight dollars per person persuaded vaccinate. show causes significant reductions COVID-19, preventing least one infection every six vaccinations lottery successfully encouraged. findings promising similar CCL public health initiatives. guys idiot Republican “heroes” bravely killing Americans shitty policy.

What bunch idiots. governor wants stop mandating masks..... aren’t kidding. that’s true, it’ll tear population month. didn’t vaccine way people would die Reddit? Sensationalized name game lmao  okay since like ever though. .004% chief.  Correct. vaccine reduces spread least 75-85 percent.

“What’s even remarkable 1918 flu, say infectious disease experts, never really went away. infecting estimated 500 million people worldwide 1918 1919 (a third global population), H1N1 strain caused Spanish flu receded background stuck around regular seasonal flu.
But every often, direct descendants 1918 flu combined bird flu swine flu create powerful new pandemic strains, exactly happened 1957, 1968 2009. later flu outbreaks, created part 1918 virus, claimed millions additional lives, earning 1918 flu odious title “the mother Spanish flu hit fall 1918; second surge occurred January April 1919, smaller one followed winter 1920. Forty million people died flu, including 550,000-750,000 Americans. later learned flu H1N1 strain influenza. Secondary bacterial pneumonia often cause death agree end pandemic occurred 1920, society ended developing collective immunity Spanish flu, although virus never completely pro-life.   Mentally, obviously. that's requirement GOP. Yes, places lots unvaccinated people. source pediatric cases? heard podcast seen anything yet like numbers ages. total theater point. telling there's deadly virus yet long wear mask (intermittently that!) go bar, music venue, movie theater? What? kinda logic that. like saying there's F9 tornado long wear windbreaker go play golf. someone push wheelchair pier Gulf Mexico?  Tell thousands thousands Broadway staff (not performers) work 18+ months. going disease good part near future, tools available (vaccines masks) limit spread, time open let patrons decide want come not. Opposite be. Mask up, vaccinated, stay safe. know they're average person. Could President Biden's stealth account! tree branch little bigger... go, pretty likely I'll exposed, right?

SLC rate 18 cases per 100k per day. 

The odds vastly favor exposed. 

Assuming arent immocompromised, odds also favor exposed wont symptomatic.

If odds favor really low chance exposed low chance symptomatic, odds well favor slight cold. Reality liberal bias.  weren’t major outbreaks last school year Utah, online technically mask mandate, sister high school said practically nobody followed Wait govt made illegal take precautions dangerous disease spreads rampantly? understanding something wrong here? know kids fare much much better adults/elderly COVID, still would've nice get 0-12 group covered vaccines Delta swept through. 

I agree argument world needing move forward. Among adult population, we've AMPLE time evidence shows vaccines work. Hobbling rest society try slow inevitable spread virus among people utterly determined thumb nose anything deemed ""authority"" common sense. 

I've called asshole clutching pearls crying stories Unvaccinated Billy Bob Alabama ventilation still dreaming spitting face anyone vaccinated wearing mask, really can't muster much empathy types. Thats great point actually considered that. Thanks sharing experience Something pointed lot people getting believe free. healthcare system trained people think hidden cost. tracks pretty good correlation unvax health insurance. Probably means advertising free way way more. incredibly stupid event. 

Literally guaranteed people wouldn’t protected unless time travelers. Speaking myself, going masks prevents feeling like normal balanced self.

Staying home does, too, course, really winning (and others feel similarly). Fucking twilight zone. get it. lockdowns table don’t anything point. responsible deaths thousands Texas. 

I hope one day people realize karma catches man. many daily cause hospitalizations LA County, think? Ignore him. Literally, ignore everything says out. one's required listen someone incapable leading.  wait doggone minute. Texas #35 spending education #17 educational outcomes.

Covidictatorship got COVID test Miami two weeks ago car there. lady gave paperwork didn’t even mask on.

Fast forward location two weeks later easily 100 cars line they’re back touchless registration. Don’t care.

The virus stay, open eventually. Vaccines help save lots lives, mitigate risk COVID-19, thus fulfilling purpose, no?

I won’t going back old ways fully vaccinated. see others won’t either, takes toll mental health. 

Call idiot whatever.

This pandemic soon, countries feels long overdue. 

Get shot, go back normal. 

COVID-19, become endemic. fiancée one breakthroughs. I’m holed basement negative far. mild symptoms upstairs. traveled California thinking vaccine would protect her. friend traveled bought conspiracy theories didn’t get vaccine. ended vector gave her. Im absolutely furious want call friend give serious piece mind, I’m going that. It’ll make situation worse. Yup. Covid lockdowns part 2. read commenting on? People didn’t take vaccine hospitalized COVID realize serious since it’s affecting personally regret getting vaccine.


So, suggesting emphatic towards decision get vaccinated?

What information danger it’s already affected millions people. 

If you’re vaccinated really danger. point people understand seeing others go people don’t seem capable comprehending they’re hospital deathbed.

But again, dies me? Deaths covid resuced 10 fold comparable similar numbers see seasonal flu year. 

Do get hysterical every flu season well claim people getting flu shot putting life danger carry life?  Correct Covid Deniers dumb.   kept mind 21% get tested positive, 21% Alabama positive. worked lab COVID testing first round covid, still high rate Reddit really loves sensationalizing things like Agreed. read much Trump's done die 2024 election left small extremist base never get elected again.

I think know answer. I'm surprised happened sooner. states move to, attend college etc guys, it'll someone else list Brazil, India, Russia, ..... completely incapable change, adaptation, evolution. Stick head sand pretend 2018, better yet, 1950. forget ""Antiva""! ""hilarious"" effectively government works enact legislation. U.S. government can't really ""punish misinformation"" since even made-up bullshit protected 1st amendment. really want government deciding enforcing what's true not? That's really slippery slope. 

And right, like said, vaccinated people probably still transmit virus, much rare transmission unvaccinated people. unvaccinated much greater threat communities, themselves, vaccinated people vice versa. 90+ % Covid hospitalizations deaths point unvaccinated people, really fault vaccinated people cases spike hospitals filling up. 

The amount transmission overall community harm blame vaccinated people probably stupidly negligible compared unvaccinated. proportion vaccinated people even get infected exposed significantly lower unvaccinated, among infected, viral load likely reduced extent. exact extent complicated Delta variant, previous variants transmission vaccinated people basically nonexistent even breakthrough cases low viral load. far I'm aware, there's actual documentation vaccinated people spreading virus all, new CDC guidance made solely Delta variant appears cause extremely high viral loads nasopharynx, enough say probably heir side caution. say non-mask-wearing vaccinated people significantly responsible situation currently half country roams around unvaccinated unmasked, though? think that's completely ridiculous. answer never - give up. would ruin society. People would torn apart. would also learn nothing next time. feasible effort one would solve problem. problem big, mean can't solve it. much bigger problems covid, need practice. 

But answer, solution worldwide effort stop spread get people vaccinated. plan it. Pick random day. June 1st 2022. day, implement 2-3 week worldwide lockdown. People prepared. Vaccines distributed. Upon return, every single person wear mask public. Beyond this, entire new industry contact tracing arrive. include apps call centers. get wrong, people like this, would provide two critical things. 1st - organize worldwide effort (It's needed future). 2nd - bring humanity together. 

So fuck - done. Almost nothing organized done. - we've done nothing we're ideas. - let's build house everyone gets piece wood hammer yells everyone else. - lost.

You think Hannitty Tucker anyone else Fox lives sticks Oklahoma Kansas ?  Ah yes, self medicate unprescribed drugs, that's great idea.

Why load 4th dose well really get COVID out? Might well load hydroxychloroquine it.

Just follow medical guidance, hard... people deny mask effectiveness.

Most vaccinated people pissed anti-vaxxers messed us. get seniors get bad reputation, one-sided FL. village went Biden. article shows SARS-COV-2 mechanism integrate host DNA integrate experimental conditions. compared HBV, mechanism integrate host DNA experiment.

Since complete virus normally integrate host DNA vaccine even less likely so.

The posted link quoted Dr Faulkner: 

“From public health point view, would say

Well yeah, basically none fully vaccinated since 30 group able get vaccinated starting half June. real effort masking distancing south started five minutes realized pandemic disproportionately killing non-white people. They’re gambling form voter suppression.  Yeah. But, Im lucky. work home put remote school. viable option people since government nothing it. description ""impossible"" nonsense, though.

The data say ""out ~35,000 hospitalizations LA county week, 123 vaccinated"". I'm confused, want show report Public Health England, want go away? requests contradictory. fucking ghoul true vaccinated people?

No, I'm sure not. unfortunately lots unvaccinated people still there. politics. People need stop politicizing heath care pressuring CDC announce guidelines politically expedient instead what's going save lives. really hard time believing report kept searching would use small sample basically declare 70% vaccinated people contacted delta strain. makes sense… took months Remdesevir antivirals become norm. still testing things like Hydroxychloroquine early months. hospitals also completely unprepared early onslaught things like PPE. Also, think intubating early first couple months lead complications. sudden extremely questionable end masks me. Seems like idiots assholes got whole reputation shot. People encourage antivaxxer death? haven’t seen here. seen antipathy towards antivaxxers pass away thing believe doesn’t exist  Waves goes in, Wave goes out.

In states badly hit like AL, Rt number starting plateau, looks like they're peak current trends hold. Dominoes starting fall. Hope son recovers anti-vaxxers bringing end days jewish lazer gun implants fake Science. Everyone access vaccine, want get that's problem Preach. actually think something CDC mandate track breakthrough hospitalizations. number gets high, that's something worry about. tracking age group every single state? important information could vaccinated ass leaves house scared leave seeking reassurance vaccinations? yet vaccinated want see hard numbers avoiding vaccinated?

I'm sure point difficult get solid #'s breakthrough infections children 12 lead hospitalization well total breakthrough infections lead hospitalization. crazy. Poor communication CDC compounded poor communication major media orgs.  really sad part me. millions people repeating sentiment. boogeyman us discovering long-term side effects vaccine longer body within weeks injection. instructions go in, teach cells do, dissolves away leaving body fresh training fight covid.

Correct I'm wrong, can't find *single* example history medicine ""long-term"" side effects appeared 8 9 weeks vaccination. millions people well past threshold fine. couple one-in-several-million long-term effects actively studied (good! science!), there's going mass die-off infertility 1B people worldwide. isn't. literally sore throat could effectively ignore.

New Jersey highest per capita death rate state. Much higher death rate Florida Texas. guys worst yet patting back. state half New Jersey Death rate even twice many cases per capita state. sure people upvoting lies. No, true vaccine.

The Flu vaccine guarantee never get flu. Heck, vaccine guarantees anything.

Such dumb take, sorry man. Everything reducing spread vectors.

If vaccine + social distancing + masks = 10x less likely get infected, disease spreads exponentially less. slower spreads, longer develop proper cure effective vaccine.

Look flu vaccines 20 years ago vs today. 20 years ago pretty much nothing, today they're effective (but still perfect high mutation rate). curiosity - children take flu shots? There's reason expect weird symptoms years line. work like HIV chicken pox.

I've seen anything shows COVID-19 latent effects.

In fact, research cited shows research shows claim ""doesn't work like ____"" would nice research read understand little it. mask help catch it, help prevent people spreading it. I'm vaccinated, I'm fine. Haaaaave seen people frequent Disney tho one delta specific shot. poor neutralizing antibody titers vaccinated JnJ vs 2 doses mRNA. likely people going receiving third mRNA dose outbreak well even 2 mRNA doses good enough stop delta.

It 11 players, 11 people organization including least 1 player (Trea Turner, Dodger). No, mandate vaccines idiots protect others accidentally! people aren’t vaccinated, it’s huge issue. fully vaccinated, CDC says… it’s small sample size, nothing worry about. folks really brain dead blind. I've read plenty, what's point thing is, though, we're going keep tracking breakthroughs, Gottlieb saying CDC do, we're going focus positive #'s hospitalizations among vaccinated yet vaccinated (children 12), what's point?

Part problem narrative shifted fear death hospitalization fear COVID stamped completely. remember ever thinking would wiped waiting first second shot.

 think intelligent CDC track breakthrough hospitalizations total positives freaks people makes easy among anti-vaxxers, matter ridiculous may seem. Israel also still trying make life normal possible, indoor masking vaccine passports. event like happened Provincetown could still take place Israel, really change anything. Right - that's great.

FYI pre weeb - [Irish gained steam early tabletop RPGs making way anime. borrowing long line hyper specific modern nerd references :)  hit meteor. What's point? We're talking hundreds millions cases. much noise, everything happens, conclusion needs probability backed solid, well-thought-out statistics. ""I found 5 people X happened group exposed idea looks like"".

I understand worrying news, like myself. study, conclusion beyond ""we look (or create) study this"" drawn it. we?

The whole point, since beginning, keep hospital. 

If thought 94% efficacy rate vs main strain, 66% efficacy vs Delta variant meant pandemic you, that's brother.

Officials also expect level vaccine hesitancy.

If 70%+ inoculation yes, pandemic vaccinated.

In fact, places targets met, pandemic...

Look nations like New Zealand. issues. What’s different delta kids, aside infectiousness? Ugh vaccines 12 can’t come soon enough, I’ll among first line kids get infected passing someone covid corridor. Delta variant infectious. I'd keep mask you. 1000x claim study china involved 60 people Delta compared first wave .

Interesting stuff, appreciate links. still think exactly doomsday scenario. comments put perspective, study sample size 1497 fully vaccinated healthcare workers. 39 breakthrough infections documented sample. breakthrough infections, 7 developed long COVID.

Numbers like ""19% vaccinated people developing long term symptoms"" sound really alarming, base rate people even getting COVID quite small.

The recent surge infections hospitalizations among unvaccinated people brought grim realities Covid-19 crashing home many thought skirted pandemic. now, anger fatigue piled sides, question whether stories actually change minds.
Some people hospitalized virus still vow get vaccinated, and surveys suggest majority unvaccinated Americans budging. Doctors Covid units say patients still refuse believe infected anything beyond flu.
“We people I.C.U. Covid denying Covid,” said Dr. Matthew Sperry, pulmonary critical care physician treating Mr. Greene. “It doesn’t matter say.”

It advice Ms. Thompson — like 39 percent American adults — heed.
Her mother said Ms. Thompson leery quickly Moderna Pfizer vaccines rolled — culmination decades scientific research. also believed government-run campaign plot Black people like her, according mother.

Covid crashed family’s world late June two oldest sons brought virus home church camp nine boys got infected. virus swept family. came day Mr. Greene, hunter hiked across mountains, rushed hospital oxygen levels cratered.

It’s tempting call vaccine finish line know it’s true cases general.

Or getting vaccine clearly helps problem, dumbshits, regret it, give virus five people. year since Phase 1 &amp; 2 trials started. vaccines effective safe. ""Wait see"" longer excuse. think much confusion recent discussions comes lack making proper distinction susceptible infection versus able transmit others infected.

What safe say, even delta, vaccinated people much less susceptible catching virus unvaxxed people.

But still uncertainty whether infected vaccinated person likely pass virus infected unvaxxed person. young healthy ...

Don't know often I've heard this. outdated anyway. Thanks sharing, reference CDC make estimates without providing data also state this:

“asymptomatic cases difficult identify transmission difficult observe quantify.”

I put much weight this. treatments come out, vaccines come out. 13 2 yrs old. whew that's weird gap navigate Ok that’s thought. clarifying wording. Thank Good meant can't know virus vaccines going we've seen done now. don’t believe evolution telling vaccinated (read:PROTECTED) people live there's vaccine.

It's simple. vaccine *vastly* reduces risk serious symptoms death. We've figured new Delta variant spread vaccinated people too. population still risk, even care can't get vaccine. Yeah keep seeing people saying “just get shots, it’s easy!” want laugh faces. shots take anything, absolutely isn’t time vaccinate way what’s happen coming weeks even people wanted That’s problem. problem letting unvaccinated mingling vaccinated society. indoor institutions require vaccinations current approach fine.

AFAIK, no, it’s still low small percentage. far saw. That's good joke, point, health safety. need know keep special distance from. identified me, know? feel like nurses who've worked COVID wards probably anti-vaxxers.

It’s almost poor education something  experience exact opposite. I've point since February last year, general agreement community too. 

Now perspective seems there's 50/50 split community whether things going get bad seems pro vaccine that's unlikely reason. Lol real!! Wait, **higher** risk? ***BOTH*** pose risk myocarditis? people aware this? Yeeeep someone ELI5 one? Please “False” sounds like you’re claiming post false essentially agree. Oh yeah, I'm aware. fight first place though. happened often enough I'm longer surprised vote something fight state leg it. *shrug* People, unvaccinated fully vaccinated took pandemic seriously, laugh authorities try push ""Zoom Thanksgiving/Christmas"" point.

No one outside Reddit Redditor circles wants go another 2020 vaccine around working. *But muh delta* (a) missed point 30% society anti vax us

(b) getting case matter get hospitalized die. That's vaccine prevents amazing rates. Less 1,000 162,000,000 vaccinated Americans died.

(c) 400 kids died Covid 18 months. That's flu season levels risk (aka line risk we've willing assume live lives decades. it’s insane nut jobs politicized vaccination world wide pandemic. conservatives truly lowest humanity offer much like grandma? pure economic terms, reason miss $100: willingness vaccinate higher. 

You need incentives get vaccinated benefit saw getting vaccinated non-monetary.

I’m less mad sad. realize they’re wrong, feel bad got duped effective propaganda machine expense sounding like douche, didn’t want something fence, $100 wouldn’t even close enough persuade it. might work low income areas, wonder they’ll deal addicts and/or people desperate money attempting get shots they’re supposed order get cash? Something tells record keeping places not.. best. vaccines work well care people dont get  face mean? Yet many people area keep spreading lie 60% hospitals vaccinated. ""I heard news."" response. “882 people tied Provincetown outbreak. Among living Massachusetts, 74% fully immunized, yet officials said **the vast majority also reporting symptoms**. Seven people reported hospitalized.”

I hoping avoid symptoms well hospitalization.  Yeah, that’s problem. knew Delta transmissible, yet seeing comparisons startled hell me. Y’all see lallapalooza right now…. Let guess, LA MS 2 &amp;3? Unfortunately, way things going (new mandates, potential lockdowns, etc.) numbers probably go Q3.

One step forward, two steps back...  de Erausquin, professor neurology UT Health San Antonio, led study attempting determine whether cognitive problems might persist among covid-19 patients. De Erausquin’s team assessed patients three six months infected coronavirus, measuring factors cognitive abilities, emotional reactivity, motor function coordination. study authors took plasma samples 310 patients average age 69 treated coronavirus NYU Langone Health found levels biomarkers higher would normally expected, similar “the biological changes might associated Alzheimer’s brain diseases,” Snyder said. Public Relations Crisis Communication 101: message important messenger. people like trust messenger less likely listen absorb message. wonder many people unvaccinated they're afraid needles Certain politicians also want kill base Biden show bad doing. Well, keep going then. vaccines still protect hospitalization death right? don’t see would back square one anything. think Asshole Orange gotten shot publicly. think. Well time last year lot people staying home imagine year ""normal"" one last year exceptionally low rates non-covid hospitalization fewer car accidents, fewer bar fights, work accidents, etc. Also lot people might go Dr mild illnesses chose go last year avoid covid, things like trying deal flue minor injuries home instead. Every time new variant inevitably pops up, we’ll go ahead waste years lives restrictions DESPITE ENTIRE POINT VACCINE????

We gotten enough people vaccinated yet. gotta do. let Darwin Settle tab. vaccines still protect hospitalization death? fine. take money get cuba selling florida texas use move rest midwest city folks coasts. Time help too. people understand process science scientists come conclusions poor judgement choosing leaders. Putting shoes see miraculously quick vaccine development could suspicious. little understanding science world would understandably scared. 

The kind people trust simple things see them, may eventually comforted vaccinated people survived. Probably like China doing.  (I call it) Bundle testing.  Bundle 100 tests together. they’re negative great, they’re not. Rerun see who’s positive. That’s I’m saying, ain’t new information yet people tripping like going lead extinction. It’s weird US probably larger proportion previous infection would similar effect vaccination. US vaccinated + non-vaccinated prior infections probably close UK. knows. tend trail UK spikes. still seems line reduced vaccine efficacy already made abundantly clear delta first started getting going. 7 hospitalizations hundreds breakthrough cases really sound like doomsday scenario. 


Still far cry useless. yet people worried vaccines long term effects. 21.5%

Holy crap. failed school system coming back bite us ass. \^This.

Regardless beliefs, we've allowed businesses set rules (drug testing, example) long I've alive.

Hell, NFL, technically mandating anything, basically made *extremely difficult* employees (players) get shots, stating outbreak, team forfeit next game none players get paid game. Personally, would lot respect mandated shots, like wanted to, reason, simply balls to.

/rant vaccine, government DNA-altering steroid injection turn gay frog men. 

/s misinformation. upvoted?

No, thousand people. currently \~37,000 people hospitalized Covid. 3% vaccinated, la link usmnturtles vague ""until things get better"" enough.

I'm sure live, city defined metrics, actions take meet certain thresholds, etc. sure looked issue long enough? I’m familiar study err side caution. Probably should’ve specified there’s actual guidance based data. Dude. wasn’t making comparison. person replying obviously feeling new information we’ve getting trying supportive. Nowhere post say it’s *darker last year* whatever. latest news isn’t great though, lot people aren’t feeling good it, dismissing anxieties isn’t great thing either opposed acknowledging anxieties encouraging keep chin up. lot money, family nearby, custody issues, industry based area, etc. certainly hope concerned. still medium transmission even mostly protected severe disease. know empathy lacking country, pandemic end cases keep surging, vaccine efficacy drops, new mutations start circling.

We're going circles otherwise. honestly want jail time crime. jails full people already. people middle class white people take threat jail seriously anyways. Hit really hurts: bank accounts retirement accounts. Freedom long fits box… Corporate America pandemic: "" keep working usual virus big deal""

Either way- vaccinated person remains silent much better plague enthusiast runs mouth.  Mandates wear masks inside - issued Colorado Department Health - enforced businesses. 

Cops can’t enforce it. It’s law wear mask. whole state moderate risk 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 cite 75-85% efficacy infection 90%+ severe disease. Keep perspective. Still mean much, vaccination campaign managed member state different drug authority, different choices etc.

I think underplaying role EU quite bit. vaccines approved European Medicine Agency. required market authorization EU (countries also additionally market authorization, far tell, Hungary chosen so). Pfizer/Biontech, Moderna, AZ J&amp;J apply Berlin, Paris, Madrid. went EMA, gave documentation production sites approved EMA. Danish, Portugese German government official go Marburg approve Biontech's production process. 

The rollout priorization done member state state also add recommendation. far tell basically US, state also organizes vaccine campaigns independently.  That's interesting way saying ""Daily new cases Tokyo decrease 15%""  Honestly, every time people say something going happen, basically happened. Eventually everyone needs actually listen change. Cloths masks shown work fine non medical

It's \*just\* hospitalization worry about. 

And new data Israel beleived 80% serious infection. sure I’d put Money delta means anti-vaxxers, flat - earthers, toxic fan clubs!  Also good news potential boosters needed later; allowing heterologous usage vaccines (mixing mrna adenovirus vaccines better immunity) Yeah, I'm getting second shot next week, looking forward hoping i'll able travel see loved ones really disheartening hear this.

Casees New Zealand think Australia shown this. 

The biggest problem CDC refuses operate global information smack face. removing mask mandate bad. Anybody paying attention anything US outbreak knew going end. Umm... worried? I'm already anxiety max. Hey, least stuff still get covid getting vaccinated...  Still mean much, vaccination campaign managed member state different drug authority. 

I always cringe bit US vs. EU comparison honest, regards vaccines. value putting Denmark, Portugal Bulgaria figure beyond me. really need provide money kind monitoring. researchers involved work interviewed TWIV said always risk funds cut off. Meanwhile, new mutations happening animals chance spillback, need know. stops poor people getting vaccinated multiple times money? It’s “recommended” 50 shingles rare young people, however changing faster guidance get it. ask doctor give may decline guidance might take convincing shopping around. also might help story want early, like family history shingles age something. Doctors prescribe outside FDA recommendations, it’s illegal anything, severe reaction vaccine might liable going outside guidelines might make sign extra forms result.

Also note US vaccine quite expensive won’t covered insurance even get doctor FDA recommendations. all, variant came India, vaccination rate low.

The variant first observed back December 2020 India. Around time, vaccinations starting Western world. India even approved vaccine back then. So, lack vaccines really cause emergence Delta, vaccinations begin with. Also, variant first detected region necessarily mean originated there. 

But fully agree, *is* disproportionate distribution vaccines Developed Developing world, might variants springing high-population regions without adequate vaccinations. lack vaccinations India *did* end causing devastating wave infections, may helped variant spread corners world. 1/5 covid Okay issue getting shot. want someone PAY get shot. government made illegal, would get shot immediately?

If government made financial compensation vaccine illegal? suppose would get it, point holding called blackmail. ""You give things want else"" - government already giving shot FREE. WITHOUT MEDICAL COST. already handled purchase, distribution, cost medical services, storage, everything else. want government, boss, company, whoever give MORE?

It's called leverage. government wants people vaccinated, get vaccine want to. give money, give tax break, give employer tax credit giving PTO go get vaccines, it. 

They want something, want something, let's meet middle get it. government surely afford it, steal thousands every year ungrateful, socialist, freeloader.

Call whatever want, need money leverage. government wants bunch cheap fucks, let them; we'll another series lockdowns, economic downturn, etc. surprised. numbers bad yet, they're growing quickly.

THANK YOU. public health professional, I’m goddamn tired spicy-ass takes many people sub CDC. Things change public health respond change! Unfortunately it’s usually pace general public wants GA, especially Atlanta, far cry Alabama. promise mask mandates never coming back Alabama, unfortunately. Good news. people allergic pfizer moderna ingredients choice. doesnt make sense vaccine maker this. would someone thing pfizer scam sputnik. good marketing.

I would agree - stoking anti-vaxx sentiments likely cause demand spikes vaccine. remove those, left cranky millionaires state possibility entire story false. wouldnt first Russian conspiracy story turned entirely invented.

Why would famous well trusted influencers millions followers make story, especially way ""they asked us say X"" corroborated way turns expensive others (who, fact, said exactly X channels, deleting content). Best imagine sort bizarre governmental psy-op approached well trusted non-governmental individuals nobody blew whistle them?

I find less credible ""plausible deniability"" chaos operation running operational problems needed collaborators want play along (always massive risk when/if trying something like this). 

I seen entirely invented Russian conspiracies. Certainly Russia (and China) seem extremely disciplined states bizarrely high tolerance hacking activities aimed West. thing everyone working security knows.

The ""bounties US soldiers"" bit one think actually turn complete bullshit, never saw represented fact (by media... redditors, yes), merely rumor might warrant comment. little entrapment-y media politicians, particularly tough one get ""if proves true, hell pay, cannot geopolitics rumors... lets let investigation take place"" (or something along lines). Also OPV single dose, IPV five shots, place difficult make kid follow step better OPV. like method. we’re going vax mandates, make life much difficult vaccine hesitant (I know true antivaxxers lost causes).

Dine-in restaurants, indoor public place? Show vax card. I‘m hoping European Federation I'm aware, I'm European.

They're still massively successful vaccine, flawed is, still good option billions poor people whose nations cannot afford Pfizer/Moderna.

FUQED  civilian, Delta seems severe enough really picture destabilizing large portions world. next year going wild. Tons leaders populations already opposition, testy relationships neighbors.  


I really feel like need soldiers top shape respond crisis areas abroad. Especially authoritarian governments force strict protocols + vaccination + ongoing testing + *everything* populations going pull ahead rest planet (relatively speaking), economic base ability project power. know numbers messy perfect, sure countries coming stronger neighbors. obstinate nations come next months dramatically weakened.  


Generally speaking, opinion soldiers post-COVID world looks like? internal document leaked. really fault. mean patient ""because didn’t need oxygen required 8 liters""? Depending type mask absolutely protect others. High quality studies healthcare workers UK conclusively demonstrate properly fitted FFP3/N99 masks offer nearly 100% protection infection. course, said masks rather expensive require significant discipline, e.g always clean shaven guy. previous boss that. true terror. yeah guess went cheap ordered limited amount highly effective mRNA vaccines. even bothered contact Moderna Pfizer top management whole nation depends it.

Scomo, fucked fully FDA approved yet. reason employers can't mandate yet. lot places getting ready sweeping changes final FDA approval comes through. Expect see vaccine mandates penalties unvaccinated people end year. Good. Run town. We're gonna fucking die current nurse say done humanity. everyone’s rage masks go?

UAB fans definitely care UA football. Cause sure shit don’t care UAB football. deliberating trying scare whole world back Fall 2020 behavior? sure mean world. Sure, mask required still.

If required, go free. think places surging extra precaution necessary. Vaccination bare minimum, that's still good since people refuse even that. Ain’t nothing like Rolling red tide! Orrr…unvaccinated people could go get shot it’s big deal us vaccinated getting asymptomatic infections. mean, much lives sacrifice people won’t take simple steps save own?

Edit correct autocorrect Well, did. Biden's ""summer would normal"" plan basically toast. here. I'm pissed off, requiring vaccinations masks? Why?!?! would neat agree there, unfortunately government care much I. wish did. many antiviral drugs/supplements used years. think they've highly affective. there's doubt would amazing solution. feel like released sick people make government money. knows, I'm currently sick spewing random things mouths every five seconds. they're unsure stick one story sure. That's I'm saying. Possibly. thought LAUSD returning full in-person classes offering online option, might mistaken that. might last NM probably like 48 yet we've done quite well vaccines covid response general

Not sure how, Vaccines end game stop letting people ruin us. ruined us summer ruining summer. wish talk mandatory vaccination brought more. Sorry ones gunna put mask way misinformation spreads telling millions people who’ve done part. 

Does anyone ELI5 mandatory vaccines cant happen? I’m certainly saying efforts anything thing aimed bottom line. :) That's healthcare America, unless use ACA marketplace. Everything mentioned fat people issues. problem go work work lean meat vegetables diet. think hilarious mention treat fellow people literally care health. I'm gonna you... lol see sane person saying ""this vaccine mark beast microchip form"", are. Thought Mississippi  Dang. guess I've industrial job sites range temperatures taken daily questionnaires, twice weekly rapid testing. I've two outbreaks, one 18 21 guys company tested positive. everybody respected mask thing, didnt expect case old tough guy types. like that, went vaccinated sort vaccinated. Although bottom line (profit) I'm glad see they're requiring people get vaccinated. want unvaccinated live uncomfortable existence point they'll give get shot(s). Shun businesses, employment, social gatherings, etc. Tell can't board plane unvaccinated. need take hardline stand dangerous people something simple help themselves, also society. need viewed liabilities rather ""freedom fighters"". guy rooftop neighborhood flooded water rising quickly. prays prays God save him. praying guy boat paddles tells man roof room him. man roof replies, ""NO, faith God, God save me."" returns praying. boat paddles off.

The flooding gets lot higher. water rushing faster, man prays harder.

As water reaches rooftop, helicopter flies overhead, voice microphone tells man going send rope ladder fly safety.

The praying man refuses helicopter says, ""No thank you, man faith. God save me."" helicopter flies away.

10 minutes later flood overtakes roof praying man's lungs fill turbulent water asks God: ""God, devout life, save me?!?""

God replies, "" sent boat helicopter, else expect do?""

God sent masks, warnings vaccines. deny God. people get faster achieve immunity. yes encouraged this. get English isn’t first language, makes title fairly misleading, article linked language people can’t read, isn’t clarification. 

Your title makes sound like people protesting vaccine countries listed, honestly don’t know vaccine protests. heard anti-lockdown protest anti-masking protests, aren’t anti-vaccine protests. change word ""raise"" ""bonus"". correct. analogy makes better sense. rest still applies though  One estimate put infection rates day plausibly possible 200,000 day. would winter levels, basically bad ever been. Time tell, little reason believe 49% vaccinated infectious vaccinated people huge impact slowing spread national level, though regions could see better results higher rates appropriate restrictions true, except people get regularly tested work, etc. can't use say definitively virus prevents mild cases. obvious keeps getting severely ill, highly likely less severe illness means lower amount virus produced means less contagious. dudes exact facial hair... like 6 Jan. dudes...

It’d like job couple years ago well decided pay next person try increase incentives well.

Again, don’t disagree main point rewarding bad behavior, agree money would good people too. government thought incentives beginning rollout. things way can’t changed.

US certainly afford collect data. unvaccinated people get COVID faster COVID ceases huge problem since higher percentage sort immunity longer support masking social distancing.

That's student loans work. ever wonder can't expunged bankruptcy like loans?

Or banks eager give 17 year old $100k student loan, $100k business home loan?

Pretty sure neither.

Its pretty obvious week vaccinated close nothing comes infected Delta carrier (though great deal terms outcome).

Lest anyone think I'm hindsighting I'm internet dumbass, expert, aggregated information coming various sources made pretty clear ago. Gov Abbott really trying hard, tirelessly working ensure many us Texans die covid possible. sure wants that, pretty clear does. Lithuania little month. actually covid passport app either vaccinated else weekly covid tests. It’s great theory, except enforcement ultimately falls individual business enforce. places ask it, places wanted (need) revenue. mean permanently work remote cheaper city don’t get vaxxed? punishment? fuck? get that, stupid reason holding out. countries approved arguably may even better reputation FDA. Health Canada, EU, etc.. seems like Shake Shack announcement, we're going seeing businesses implementing vaccine mandates opposed mask mandates. Thats way be. Thst generation also avoided vaccines well. basically every generation one wants true. true, would behoove us act accordingly keep sheltering behind articles tell us want hear. fully vaccinated percentage China still low (comparing USA EU). think vaccine effectiveness plays huge role goal still ""zero-covid"".

It's test see whether China's city-wide mass testing, extensive contact tracing, strict/mandatory quarantine, zone lock measures still effective delta variant.

So, unless SARS-CoV-2 becomes virulent causes people become severely ill self-isolate transmit virus people, pressure become less deadly.

Literally laughed loud.  Lost one family member week another probably put ventilator tonight/tomorrow. idiot tools refused get vaccinated. understand Republican logic one. literally killing voting base.  back square one. I'm sure people suggesting that. acknowledge fact vaccines work vaccinated people still spread virus. mutually exclusive. idea people see one other. Everything bigger Texas, even Big Government dictating smaller local government. immunosuppressed 4 antibody tests, negative. huge response second dose Moderna early February I’m hoping there’s protection going can’t measured current tests. good news coming Israel even though vaccine's ability stop catching covid appears wane less effective Delta, still effective keeping getting severe illness needing hospitalization.

I'm okay risking catching covid going send hospital. don’t good breakthrough data. We’d known cdc didn’t screw tell vaxxed people get tested didn’t symptoms. probably depend circumstances exposure also. go 4 hour closed window car ride infected person chances getting infected higher. think strategically risks might taking. That’s great friends vaccinated, it’s got reassuring. it’s really feeling comfortable. I’m crazy careful wife immunocompromised. 

Everyone take care care about. People make really hard decisions things no-brainers pre-Covid. It’s confusing really annoying. Yes, know much 75-85 going drop, age/co-morbidity cohort might finding spectrum. ""Still"" mean small block time. There's pretty obvious goalpost-moving going on.

And no, I'm one going despair life never normal again. much think time stop saying ""yeah, numbers!"" default answer everything. know. Israel outlier studies don’t handy, gave “sermon” talking child-sex-trafficking tunnels used Democrats White House Congress. So, yeah, pretty typical talk guy.

That's rough vaccine effectiveness around 88%

Very rough”

Very encouraging 

The thing wish he’d others would mention immunity following infection factor ending pandemic well is.

Stupid example: Universities Germany publicly funded. Many botanical gardens, many gardens open public. since university publicly funded, allowed charge entrance fee, even sell surplus plants. instead put sign suggests much money put donation box visiting, much money donate take surplus plant.

If special situation arises requires university charge admission fees (let's say inner city location makes necessary gardens guarded night university wants offset salaries), takes many years legal gymnastics make happen.

Rationally, get worse later year. Unless start implementing boosters, summer months supposed *less* contagious months seen last year. booster even S.A. variant booster Pfizer &amp; Moderna developing own, tools vaccines year ago. currently vaccinated. winter brutal unless miracle happens. 

Those can't receive vaccine asking get infected new variant. Haven’t felt sick yet loss smell. Roommate got sick claims get shot mad masks. /s 😬 gotta move Tested how, PCR tests said faulty. beginning don’t know, recommend masks.

Period.

Full ffucking stop. Yeah honestly wearing mask help keep people safe last year, there’s fucking way I’m now. least workplace, unvaccinated seem people didn’t/still don’t wear masks, fuck wear one made responsible decision get jab. 

The unvaccinated population claims patriotic, yet basic deed help country claim love much. every country world, although less patriotic US, understands things need done greater good, everything individual freedom. ?? That’s subreddits too. also latch negative news studies anything ignore anything that’s good news. Posts negative news tends get upvoted subs posts good news do.

I'll bet they'll anyway, unless every unvaccinated Covid patient gets infertile Hello, thread still alive?

I would like ask question, one make new vaccine derived delta variant combat it?

I saw somewhere mRNA vaccine quicker design create conventional ones. find virus mutates (and does), concerning, 'tweak' original vaccine tackle mutation. (Correct I'm wrong)

Moderna mRNA-1273, B.1.351 variant found created booster (mRNA-1273.351). BioNTech Pfizer instead coming idea 3-dose vaccination? night trouble breathing used asthma inhaler took Benadryl addition usual Sudafed, mucinex, cough syrup combo. also spent time lying stomach. It’s like “tummy time” babies do. increases oxygen. husband also spent quite bit time patting back help clear lungs. said fell asleep stopped breathing times (apnea?) scared shook make breathe again. 7% population 7% growth though Sweet Jesus. miss days government overreach influence private businesses. lie? Oof, sorry hear that. fully recovered? No, would lower. positivity rate based amount testing doing. test symptomatic individuals, get really high rates. start testing asymptomatic individuals (who less likely covid), positive test percentage drop (although might overall positives, far negatives).

This number useful subject huge amount confounding factors, vary state, locality, month year, current government actions, scared people covid week, factors.

I recommend following hospitalizations, well deaths, since tend much risk type skewing. That's 92 halfway 99, max level. symptomatic infections? infections…? ""Despite fear people getting vaccinated covid-19, surge antivaxx groups strong disinformation campaigns, 2020 refusal vaccines fell almost half registered health emergency.

Which is, course, main reason everyone needs fuckbags get vaccinated: every infection chance mutation breaks vaccine. Alabama never failed live rest nation expects them.  Bravo.

This kind comment makes Reddit worth browsing. upvoted comment entire thread. Unfortunately, it’s doesn’t follow “hurdur Republicans vax pandemic over, simple!” narrative. takes quick look rest world covid threads recently see contagious vaccines, still highly effective, effective we’re told. physically possible 3x vaccinated people unvaccinated got infected? Unless I’m misreading data…it sounds like vaccine hardly protects infections all. Yes 71% 65 newark people complaining seniors protected enough blaming antivaxxers getting vaccinated causing continue that's simply true everywhere. Fucking good?   Likely full FDA authorization yet. auth comes, I'm assuming insurance companies going jack rates unvaxed people immediately. know Lord Savior Nick Saban! Roll tide 26 year old kid start charged LA county billion faulty tests Fuck em, even try. save sympathy folks can't vaccinated. What's end goal positivity rate? close 0 possible? interval, might every 5-6 months.

Early data shows even stronger immune response 3rd shot 2nd shot.

So possible 2nd shot (maybe 1 specific delta) might last substantially longer, cement permanently.

It's soon know actually play out.  is.  got double 5G upgrade--Moderna, Pfizer--and quadruple gay before. really fucking care. you?  take look ""starfish story"" sometime

edit: coy TV.

It wrecks portfolios why, makes media group owners angry. Gotta turn youtube want hear it, heh. unless local government orders events shut down, they're going ahead scheduled. 

Two medical shows Florida August cancelled last 24 hours accord lol. One middle set up. I'm also conventions, I'm willing let people cough mouth that's takes go back poverty wage unemployment checks got kicked apartment, I'll -- guaranteed I'll able to. check recent days see 5k distributed days state count. worldometer used (may still??) take state numbers move backwards whatever date state says occurred rather date reported Doubtful. whole ""it emergency approval"" excuse.

Pick subject, make statement. Stop calling people dumb don’t know anything them, even maybe don’t call people dumb, it’s ad hominem constructive That's good point. dumbasses bring us universal healthcare covid parties. silver lining maybe? really hope do, comrades. Incorrect. OP would def stand out, tons people, including mother, wear mask face shield time far know, she’s never shot. Watch hot takes now, ya hear? % pfizer folks get myocarditis? evenly distributed moreso one age group another?

what allergic reaction ingredients think get nurses site can't fix? could told that. better switch fucking sisters masks on. \- lot different data -- pull think Ptown impressive place summer. people everywhere. talking town easily balloons population tens thousands everywhere summer.

It's gorgeous place, can't actually avoid people downtown area. Ya, it’s super contagious. That’s lives uprooted last 18 months….. still know long covid amongst vaccinated. lowest vaccination rates state age senior citizens fully vaccinated, college students absolutely refusing to. extremely important virus spread densly populated areas developing countries.. civilised countries authorities fucked hard last year general population refused wear masks practice social distancing equally fault.
If common sense, maybe Delta around everything would better... Yeah. They're POSITIVE COVID! Look, get saying. reports far, vaccinated individuals prone carrier used be, vaccine still effective. world whole might able withstand delta variant, vaccine whole readily available long time. preventable. dying ""heroes"" save world.

This hilarious leaving ones relate understand even get it, either Bruh wut? nurses get vaccine?  Yeah, timeline difference though. vaccinated person (assuming virus gets foothold) clear virus thus done shedding virus much sooner unvaccinated person. mean unvaccinated people wear masks, important note. remember large number people stupid making public (and factual) statements vaccine's inability prevent X, give fuel need continue make excuses get vaccinated. Instead important focus mitigation tactics need deployed clear way. example: Exposure covid infected persons usually means quarantine 2 weeks, contact tracing needs performed everyone came contact exposure quarantine. vaccinated individuals quarantine timeline shorter.  Imagine pissed get infected breeze get heavily sick.

They probably blame non solidaric taking easy way lmao try Yeah, I'm confused terminology here. Maybe ""Black"" status means diverting ambulances/canceling procedures, time I've heard term ""Code Black"" US bomb threat. Yeah, children start low risk baseline, bad sounds. Vaccinated elderly still risk getting severe case Covid (Delta not) unvaccinated children. almost like full effects economic policies take years come fruition. Shocking.

Which work news cycle, people's attention spans, critical thinking. are. too. Still love patients yea sucks ok medicaid cover poor people unless disabled kids anyway. Thank brave service us agree state depressing, want know we’re bad…🥲 Wow nice hear truth actual nurse. Thanks sharing wish people would get bad hoax Lets double every three days! JnJ essentially useless stopping delta infections. need either second dose mRNA dose top it. Murica fuck yeah approval process long original since booster? Including kids - decent percentage fully vaccinated. it’s like areas percentage 60s probably 80% vaccinated. Living life normal cold/flu season higher risk myocarditis mRNA vaccines. 1 5000. us playing chess unvaccinated playing hangmen. Hey least they’re positive it! Whopping cough. got vaccinated whooping cough (TDAP) around 12 years ago forgot get booster. Jan 2020 got whooping cough sucked. fun.  Lately? Try 18 months counting. They've virtually useless far tell. Oh wait another month so... Close border, keep there.... Might wanna check AP poll last year, also recruiting rankings. Rekt.

Roll Damn Tide Pawwwwwl Alabama strain nice ring Covid…….. get people vaccine floor, floor icu. I'm forcing anyone anything. want get vaccinated it, don't, well don't. 

Also want wear 6ft masks, guest.

We never even get close heard immunity, even country does, others wont. 

You continue support cultish divisive behavior, realise everyone gives much fuck virus start going back normal. think happens though see larger amount skeptics lean towards getting vaccination. Conservative ring Hi. lasted day me, worse 12 hours, know sucks. going laid visualizations things enjoyed. Hope feel better!!! NJ A. Hit 1st wave. 1st wave states higher death rates hospitals still trying figure treat covid idea treatments effective. led high death toll. B. NJ densely populated state United States. large handicap comes fighting covid. However, caused NJ one serious states dealing covid state higher vaccination rate many others. NJ really resilient little state, seeing worst wave, bad place right now. talk vaccinated people say ""we"", others use ""I"", *a lot*. Listen it. surprise me. moving goalposts

Because got new data data scared them.  covid vaccine? Mortality rate isn’t 100%, people survive get mild outcome buy bs 60 might want get third dose. True enough. Mississippi Alabama's ugly friend take make look better. could prevented. 

I understand frustrations unvaccinated folks, remember globally 15% world fully vaccinated, leaving 85% population vulnerable infection thus likely produce variants. all, variant came India, vaccination rate low. simply enough vaccine global community new variant going arise it’s unvaccinated globally, large percentage willing get vaccinated yet opportunity. comes goes. bad first days. LOL What? think mainstream newspaper publish email CDC hack? Good! Alabama heavily Republican state poor people. Two things already bad enough never mixed together. fucking deserves it. keep moving goalposts vaccines Delta variant spreads. weeks ago, authorities saying ""the pandemic you"" vaccinated. 

Now they're saying ""well least likely dead.""

I hasten add people definitely get vaccinated, seem reducing expectations dramatically. grandmother convinced supposed flu months start pandemic form coronavirus. ill weeks. Criticism happen science, results extreme, taken lightly. Denial. could even never mono before, covid could trigger seem little bit stupid vaccine isn’t “approved” even half damn country taken it. I’m going honest, ever hear someone ever use phrase like “fear-mongering” relation public health face ever again, physical confront them. Cult Normalcy dragged us right back fucking pandemic bad news made tummies hurt. Actually live Indiana 😂 lock em let god sort em  Thank you. breakthrough case unfortunately kids got Covid, too, son likely me. It’s hard quarantine kids. It’s little intense side us I’ve posting Reddit partially process. saying long haul covid occurs people infected mononucleosis past? (If studies correct?) unironically does. Well Israel already ordered 3rd pfizer booster shot elderly, think serious reason worry point. go armed, psychos lot bully it. would hard mandate vaccination entry US, could reasonably claim unvaccinated pose risk patrons whereas vaccinated people not. longer case therefore happen. We’re told someone catch Covid infectious regardless vaccine status. So, difference vax unvaxxed chances person Covid give others, something impossible use way choose go not.  Haha hilarious! could worse home province (Alberta) announced sick covid every right run around spreading disease. That's shoved intellectuals one place, could keep eye them. trust book learnin. current ones provide chance sterilizing immunity. 90% delta, like 60%. Abbott uses wheelchair, saying “stand guy,” they’re making fun disability. pretty lame, ask me. Cannot even imagine that's like. Instead ramping vaccinations thought could go zero covid without issues. seems alarmingly obvious unavoidable matter successful been. probably right, bet days need least associate's degree work Target. Abbott wheelchair since paralyzed tree fell age 26. think comment misleads empath is. think poorly written. live Idiocracy.

We got bad parts movie without good stuff like toilet sofa chair hand job Starbucks. here's good post [vaccine saw Instagram. Thought I'd share here. Hence need vaccinations  really know what's governments plan regarding actually since communicated little topic. restrictions come back seem actual long term plan they're going do. general huge want open up, completely understandable, planned is, least me, complete mystery. talks corona passes nothing conrete yet.

One thing clear planning move, months time, focusing case numbers putting weight ammount people hospital ICU general giving less weight ammount cases.

I would except seem know little long covid possible neurological cognitive impacts covid. course long covid manifests mostly persistent cough biggie, colds flus persistent symptoms manifests long term fatigue, brain fog good. eh. fuck right. **step bro entered chat** kids not. Go look data come back share found.

CDC publishes hospitalizations age. Yep. Every COVID patient ICU unvaccinated. They're also younger last wave. God punishing Alabama wickedness.

God punishing Alabama refusing love neighbors.

God punishing Alabama following false prophets.

God punishing Alabama taking Lord's name vain.

God punishing Alabama hypocrisy.

God punishing Alabama lack charity, false performative faith, willful ignorance, unwillingness love, unwillingness forgive, false, vile, pervasive perverse sense unearned moral superiority.

The vast majority citizens home state terrible representatives Kingdom, many discover soon unwelcome it. Yes comment replied literally said vaxxed contagious unvaxxed, hence masks That's next step anyway, drop e everything altogether once. OPs comment delta variant thought meant fair point 19% around 40 people insignificant number practically means nothing. Yeah appears happen need way way data less 10 people symptoms likely self reported. AdventHealth hospital system put Central Florida Division code black due surge patients suffering COVID-19, officials say, adding number patients surpassed previous peak January.

That’s good. crazy, upside-down world. We're global pandemic, there's ""backlash"" people taking one thing truly protect virus (and also helps protect others). mind-boggling. Maybe deaden sense misery declining world they're due inherit Florida Man strikes again.  lot unvaccinated uneducated, lower income, don’t passport, never travel outside state country. live conservative area, able get away vaccinated.  good. Huntsville dweller well, even image perfect fit, drive far Huntsville find rest Alabama. Restaurants packed minimal masks currently. We'll see happens US Government employee decision vaccination next week. Getting vaccinated helped lot rest it’s pretty much letting time run course see happens. 1 dose effective, says 44% 2 doses 2 days ago 

Also I've commented elsewhere bottom part studied vaccines VS world now. truly may effective hang tiny places poor 12th highest coronavirus vaccination rate world — similar many counties Bay Area using largely types vaccines.
But past month, people received least one vaccination dose accounted three-quarters coronavirus infections Singapore, according 44% cases occurring fully vaccinated people, along 30% partially vaccinated 25% cases found karaoke bars markets, pushed Singapore government last week to tighten COVID-19 restrictions, including banning in-person dining limiting size said vaccine efficacy studied early on, people restricted cautious. Now, moving freely. said developments Singapore line current data. says slides referencing viral load Indian study. think it’s study that’s retracted scrambling. quick back-of-the-envelope calculation virus R0 = 10, looks like herd immunity reached 67% immunity. would still get herd immunity entire population vaccinated, even vaccine 75% effective. DeSantis children. India virus. I'll say vaccinated people far protected unvaccinated. absolutely clear threat ppl *freaking* notion full vaccination perfect protection. Well I'm hoping vaccine mandate. time stop playing games half measures. Full vaccine requirements now. I’m curious people forum calling us selfish jerks - vaccinated, willing continue masking, longer feel need complete social recluse isolation- think this.

This coming scientists experts. Recently there's lots research fact long haul covid might literally activation mono, kissing disease, particularly nasty virus make people sick while. agree thoughts maybe sick, also means isn’t true vaccine shouldn’t called one still get COVID. idea mind folks refuse pay money ""the man"" case. lot planners bunch. could wrong. kinds moves making inconvenient unvaccinated go get vaccinated. think win people over. coworker claims reason remaining unvaccinated getting vaccinated would ""waste [his] time"". get point getting vaccinated prevents lot annoyance inconvenience, people like might make effort go get done. They’re supposedly releasing tomorrow. straight sucks. sobering shit right here. Fox better report make official. wanted info kids see anything. hope beat easily! got vaccine 2-3 weeks ago, probably going experience mild case. Hopefully mild! We've honestly discussed it! Texas homes worth much, though, able move packing many funds  they’re not. Children 12 can’t get vaccine yet. underestimating giant vulnerable population.

Similarly, outbreak begins low vaccinated area, may see faster spread country-wide vaccination rate would suggest.

When see early outbreaks seem extreme outliers data, view caution. Obviously *might* sign higher expected breakthrough rate, I'd say early panic. Wikileaks nooooooooooooot sending anything sensitive. Go credible journalists. virus load that’s known deadly

Nope reminder. latest CDC data still shows 75-85 percent protection infection 90 percent hospitalization delta. data came yesterday fantastic anything vaccines still effective. let sub get much, people overwhelmed right think. one reasons people hesitant get tested. unpleasant process. would great similar breathalyzer test.
On hand, read China said anal swabs ""accurate""
Could imagine standard? doubt much testing would get done.  way things going, suppose going find out. can't exactly that. people truly cannot get vaccine. Making explain every time try get groceries solution. what… ""There's atheists trenches."" God hope so. reading article right? 21.5% positive results random tests general population? apocalyptic, unless tests already ill people hospital setting. Australia got army streets enforce lockdown worst-hit city ...the positive case rate 0.18% No, it’s true…. Remember us stay try fix inside. Well you’re vaccinated still really isn’t much risk need fear. Pretty sure everyone wasn’t ready panic. Especially since seems people sub vaccinated. messaging 14 days [**2021-08-13 11:47:17 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-08-13%2011:47:17%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

Kind doubt actually. thing infectious it'll get then. 
 
Honestly may good thing, may reach effective herd immunity fall winter. mean CDC says probably [120 Americans infected already. That's 33% population. + like 55% population vaccinated.. adjust fair bit overlap gotten also vaccinated.. need another good surge infectious possibly end here. EVERYTHING’S FINE Compare case count graph one Update expectations new variant; 2020.

!RemindMe 2 weeks  10,000 people ICU beds real fact ICU usage nearing 10,000 rapidly....*


Uhhh... Bruh, maybe keep data? Recovery anosmia 88%. individual probably recover.

67% people Covid experience anosmia. 8% cases lose enjoyment food permanently.

Yes, even mild otherwise asymptomatic cases.

It interesting see America like 8% population lost ability enjoy food.

Or 4%, suppose, vax rate hovering around 50%. Thankfully yes. mandatory statement stock market crash…. mean kids, eligible vaccine go back school five days week two weeks? Odd almost mirror happening Florida. told vaccine would make us invulnerable. People acting accordingly. really sucks wait long littles get vaccinated, especially someone teaches preschool. also want studies effective job figuring dosage showing safe take it. time kiddos work take vaccine, nearly two years thing. Kids starting youngest class (2.5yr olds), known nothing pandemic life, really sad. Hey man, need apologize. Thank sharing story. hindsight 20/20, looks like made lifestyle changes wonders health long run. Keep seeing psychologist, eating healthy, exercising. I'd also open family internal struggles, since support recovery phase really help. Best luck let know anything do. Keep mind older, conservative, much interested getting jab, younger. stand lose generation, maybe two. Older people will, again, parent grandkids. exactly. empaths narcissists all. may even opposites. 

i believe 'empath' essentially another term 'highly sensitive person' though know may minor differences two. much real thing. never get covid again. best vaccination all. Yeah. Gonna need see data that. Dude, stop it. Please, stop.

I waited year half, put entire life hold, people could vaccines protect themselves. Now, death rate wave far lower previous ones, nearly deaths occurring people *chose* get vaccinated, decided wanted risk.

I absolutely hate what's happening people. want see anyone die. viruses spread, do, new variant extremely good it. disease-spreading behavior basic human instinct, fucking mental health delaying going stop risk-takers getting Covid eventually. What's going happen going happen.

We vaccines. treatments. hope people decide accept things. There's nothing reasonably expect do. Yeah, actually gets botox injections too. makes angry typing out. look forward foundation European Bureau Investigation. People send investigate Polish hate crimes, corrupt Spanish business people, Dutch coke barons, put special EU level jails facing EU judges.  Surprised Pikachu Suggestion covid could still result death double vaxxed person called misinformation.

This straight lie. one ever saw saying vaccines 100% effective death. high 90% range. everything backs that. 3rd slide document shows 25 fold reduction death among vaccinated compared unvaccinated people.  got pinged twice track trace app within two days, fully vaccinated. One flight everyone packed like sardines many wearing masks, vaccines mask I'm sure would've caught covid.  Nope. said long COVID still possible fully vaccinated people. chance still reduced order magnitude infection happens all. Yeah, I'm there. city, mind you, still there. every 50th person see wearing mask. Statement retracted due new poling data. Hahaha fuckin idiots, stupid choice Honest God lived state like I'd move. getting numbers I’ve noticed vaccination rate rising NY, especially among adults. didn’t think we’d hit 75% adults first dose later August earliest, looks like we’ll get soon. 

I feel lucky live state vaxx rates pretty high. Delta burn unvaxxed sending hospital worse- morgue, hospitals likely strained time around since adults highly vaccinated. live Alabama. School starts less two weeks, district doesnt mask mandate, youngest isnt old enough vaccinated. hate immoral refuse something protect others.

You cant tell someone cries wearing mask wal mart cares lives others, something small protects lives others totally immoral selfish, nothing vague that.

You draw line people point. tell someone click link 101.. 
 
Buddy, R0 specific term meaning infectious nascent unprotected population. half population natural antibodies vaccinated whatever, transmission rate obviously fast outbreak. transmission rates *beyond* initial outbreak, typically use term like Rt. 
  
 
So chickenpox R0 10-12, *effective* transmission rate current population 3.7-5.0. 
 
There's whole lot abusing term ""are-naught"" subreddit little bit annoying.  mean, can't directly apply US UK higher vaccination rates different rollout.


Also numbers vaccuum, vaccines exist lockdowns restrictions would likely last longer.  see also time bakery want bake cake July 29. 0 new cases ?  Yep. Besides saw coming 2019. ""tanked up,"" healthcare needs idiots went Florida fun hot zone.

Never stopped wearing mask. Bought cartons full prices dropped summer ""because over, yay?""

Fuckin idjits. I'd like reporters writing articles ask folks, ""What could government, medical community, friends family said got COVID-19 convince take vaccine?""

It's pretty obvious folks feel fact, try get information might help others? choices agree Israel study revised. initially comparing cases overall country vax rate, even though spread cities much higher vax rate. spread moved countey-wide mirrors countries seeing mostly unvaccinated people hospital. go round two start showing masks nonsense, I’ll ask leave.

I impressed uses line next Klan meeting think LOT people misconception, usually associate republicans terrible Mississippi Republican terrible. 

Perhaps wrong projecting onto you. made Greg Abbot change. He's threatening businesses mask mandates lol.  Manipulation ok you’re using powers good mankind. think significantly impacting infections? I'm sure without spectators many tests. America. We’re own. Yes, I’m aware. point assuming basically full immunity hearing numbers like 95% Rolllll Tiiiiiiide. something like that. indeed, thats death 500% higher chicken pox vaccination started. “if you’re fully vaccinated, wearing outside, you’re indoor public locations, extra step protecting home.""

Pretty sure Fox took context. didn’t hear read outdoors heard OUTSIDE house public settings Half family Alabama. found 40-year-old cousin Delta variant isn’t expected survive. three kids 15. know bought conspiracies didn’t get vaccinated. stupid senseless. I’m angry everyone involved Right’s misinformation machine. unfortunate can't mandate vaccine contractors work military bases. That's often significant prob population. honestly can’t tell satire That's good news, ton vaccine hesitancy early on. mandate vaccines.... really hard. moved Alabama Chicago, cost home went 150k 800k, taxes home went $800/yr $17k. I’d love live Denver instead, couldn’t find aviation company willing hire Denver living Alabama. covid, scariest part. Felt confusion like woke (the first 2 3 min) week. I'm pretty sure *most* went away months, who's say... Somewhere there, every dad watching sheds single tear  lot people probably going try get third booster shot right lying saying gotten shot before. recorded another ""vaccinated American"". truly fudge data monitoring pandemic needs stopped immediately. 
 
Because can't really enforce way scenario, thing really make getting third shot permitted least people recorded. 
 
This one major faults vaccination free-enterprise ""stop cornerstore get shot!"" system. stimmys unvaccinated appears spread easily vaccinated populations vaccinated otherwise healthy people end hospital. reddit posted last night one hospitalized adults cape cod healthy 40 year old.

The data still gathered, unreasonable cautious CDC seeing. I'm sorry.. hope family recover quickly. kids worry everyday could happen. shit makes wonder why....why outdoors...are telling us something discovered nothing specific text SG state something specific actual can't really explain CDC staffed brainless. There's legitimate reason come explain [Providencetown caused change especially late game. America back, indeed.

Tl:dr; Spreader event outside Cape Cod, primarily spread fully vaccinated account **74%** cases, majority symptomatic. Vaccines US wasted high rate multi-dose vials. 2 doses given pharmacy day opens 10 dose vial wastes 8 doses chickens coming home roost moment anti-vax crowd. frustrating ignorance jeopardizes others, hope silver lining Delta speedy beast blasts quick gets quick, sort ""ripping band-aid off"" moment.

The never-vax crowd always going pain, unless going send teams people sticks midwest/south forcibly injecting vaccines, risk exactly see happening always going there. Maybe best get surge way fast instead slow drip feed population circulating virus many months/years. 

If moment, would've preferred type wave occur course every age group eligible get vaccine, least at-risk death ample time get protected now. probably Scott Gottlieb. He's done lot help understanding. Cause want anyone know... here, I've alter ones Bona Fide fit tape nose part. every ""Fat, ventilated stupid way go life, son""  There’s need identify resident order get shot? made normal pooping weird. bring bidet-lite everywhere now. parents paid 100% stay home care Xmas, home school. Going assume delta better reputation? hate articles mention specific report provide direct link report. hell would want media's interpretation opinion data able look data make interpretation opinion. 

This shitty journalism. Nassamusetts  School hard knocks graduates. Start video taping confessions put ads. Privacy damned, show fools neighbors suffering regrets. think would convince get it. That's strange, guess conservative anti-vaxxers loudest anti-vaxxers Bigly Even vaccinated (double Pfizer me) contract long covid issues? 
Really? 
Don't scared plz... hard choice, FDA stepped set basic rules tobacco free-for-all one really knew packed cigarette. 

FDA's goal ([from rule help prevent young people starting use  
products, help consumers better understand risks using  
products, prohibit false misleading product claims, prevent new tobacco products marketed unless manufacturer demonstrates products meet relevant public health standard. That's fine analogy 5% delta. Especially waning antibodies many months. best numbers I've seen PHE said 88% effective, Israel data suggesting 64% effective preventing contraction. 
 
So got something like 1/4 chance contracting upon contact **and many cases locality** got problem. Vaccination **helps**, sufficient protect vaccinated people areas anymore.   headline suggests vaccines work ever close end, battle still raging.

Except, y'know, people still refuse get vaccinated, Delta variant surging, we're going back mask mandates probably far seeing lockdowns return. us got nothing months ago?

Protecting yourself, family, around nothing?   That's great long also spend 90% time complaining federal regulations state activities time ( also totally forget trump president) . seems real party line care regulation long done someone agree with. lmao hell going NBC  someone spent late December April going LTCFs vaccinating elderly tested every 3 days. indeed suck inconvenient time consuming. think “get vaxxed get tested often” campaign might work. It’ll better free donut slim chance lottery anyway.  Easy solution then, go get vaccinated convince everyone know join you. England Let's see Covid stronger family... someone let lancet know? changes everything! 110% this.

I've saying past month need soon start considering capping number covid patients hospitals certain % ICU beds filled anyone chosen get vaccinated (obviously including cannot) turned away. things stand every single one us greater risk death things heart attacks, strokes, accidents etc. Sure medical care save many lives ambulances available quickly all, there's room nearby hospital vulnerable position. fucker sociopath. [Redacted] party trying kill many people possible. insanity.  Alabama, Alberta US cause they're keeping family Build wall! Yknow get we’re little selfish younger ages, twenty year old cousin last night unvaccinated. asked literally good excuse reason, pure laziness thought process I’m young can’t hurt me. wanted pull fuckin hair out, he’s family. It’s really disappointing see younger generation behave way, social media hurt younger generations maturation process feel. celebrity lots money Gen Z’s primary motivation I’ve experienced. Color unsurprised. extending state emergency Tokyo expanding new regions Olympic Games host faces surge Covid-19 cases. ""I think people cannot see ahead and, worrying long situation last, find unbearable cannot return normal daily life,"" Reuters quoted saying.

It’s state company could get fined also encourage mask wearing fire anyone reason. changing goalposts criteria met. really worry never end unless intervening event - partial collapse economy - occurs. That, Australians stop damn scared start missing overseas holidays enough made politicians, data came major newspaper Europe.

Republican bad word now? tend anti immigration! :)  government wants bunch cheap fucks



The government given stimulus, extended benefits, advertised/purchased/transported/supplied done everything force get shot get leeeeetle bit more. capitalism, bootstrap economics, literally Republicans think democrats.



Grow up. news shocking nobody.... week left choice never non-profit deal profit deal, opening rights make vaccine manufacturers restricting rights non-profit deal. backed last minute.

Had gone choice could several different Oxford vaccine manufacturers world, companies Merck could used massive production capabilities pick production AZ failed.

Instead one else west allowed manufacture vaccine, AZ failed people instead died it. unfortunate pillows? Realistically, end game us getting infected, vaccinated mainly escaping symptoms developing mild symptoms unvaccinated suffering symptoms more. 

Maybe focusing vaccine outreach, therapeutic treatments, federal sick pay? function governor though execute laws. dictate. That’s three branches government (supposedly). lost way. Medical bills COVID cannot discharged bankruptcy- like student loans! state actually got every head coach record PSA. Even Troy ASU too. caught charity golf tournament. 

I'm sure helped bit. We're really really stubborn here. I'm glad family AL got shot, honestly going stay way rednecks personally know someone dies covid Mostly „thankfully I’m American“ Damn. heat map July. fair points. focused non-protected class stuff like beards, uniforms, etc. Employers already require flu vaccines sure Covid vaccine would different fully approved.  Color surprised see self-created problem. That's US maintain lead world #1 Covid-19. actually, know pockets world don’t don’t live fantasy last like you. Take look misinformation trust world right now, Russians don’t get vaccinated don’t trust government, South Korea Japan aren’t trusting either vastly different cultures. United States take look Alabama. virus going anywhere. Maybe wash away covid sand? Scotland we've sustained drop full month now, big drop test positivity hospital admissions going well. Might last forever, tells things likely okay. last peak biggest we've ever had, hospital occupancy much lower just... Ended. things okay. I'm much less worried month ago. would like double blind peer reviewed study indicating one great time particular bar. Wait, stupid take though? people say ""I'm vaxed care anymore"" they're referring getting screwed restrictions cancelled surgeries, they're referring chance becoming infected virus. Atleast Florida going purely similarity vaccination policy, sure. practice interesting factor. intents purposes covid, EU one country less external borders, covid passports freedom movement.

It makes sense group EU together even though may different vaccination policies, inverse scenario bunch different countries world would vaccination campaigns entirely run completely disconnected wildly different borders. Well, said, automoerator let submit post since low karma People like precisely never go away. clearly understand value vaccination people. Omg. work retail arkansas. store careful scared now. New data shows vaccines don’t prevent catching covid don’t prevent spreading it.

This *wrong*. get would think unclear reporting this, isn’t true.

The new data says *if breakthrough infection*, spread virus rate someone isn’t vaccinated.

The vaccines still effective preventing infections. downvoted OK loller. Doctor let explain: don’t get either. Ah, yes. ~~United~~ States America, something basic disease control hygiene hot-button partisan political issue.

Of course, hard bipartisan one party proudly openly wronG Pretty much everything.   May, 16% pregnant women vaccinated. COVID infection linked preterm birth fetal death, babies also risk. personally know woman got COVID back 2020, went preterm labor, baby died hospital.  Sign up, I'd love health benefits! Lose damn weight. hospitalizations staged, deaths covid, covid. /s Cool, care, neither you. literally nightmare. People put ventilators often PTSD like symptoms experience.  Oh would look that. consequences people's actions. curious. thanks work Montco’s actually 95% 18+ population 78% 12-18 least one dose. Basically anyone could get it, did, although fully vaccinated numbers lag. Natural selection work get saying. Britain 57% vaccinated quite 100% example numbers almost split middle.

So seeing 70/30 ratio. far less impressive 98/2 US presenting.

(I imagine comment continue get thumbs people like statistics show something different believe). will. course they'll say something like ""THE VACCINE'S WORK...is something wont' saying true....SO NEED BOOSTER!!"" don’t know virus transmitted everyone regardless vaccinated status. 

What currently know vaccinated MAY able transmit much unvaccinated. 

There’s major difference vaccinated unvaccinated leaving even contracting covid begin with. Vaccines remain highly effective still reduce chances becoming infected. It’s 100 bucks gives shit, lot money  Adults don’t usually end hospital RSV— it’s typically cold like symptoms days. Infants young kids get sick go hospital immune systems developing. 

Fun fact: within week whole household vaccinated took masks outside got RSV time. COVID testing came back negative fever loss taste/smell, plus spouse doctor seeing tons RSV kids… we’re pretty sure RSV. Symptoms cold-like, know kinda freaks (s COVID?) completely sniffle-free 18 months masks. Depending state, expect masking even hybrid virtual come back end game ? Even vaccinated need masks, CDC recommendations keep lagging. Limited indoor seating even fully vaccinated next. fun seeing people's reactions that. Roll Tide! Again, CDC bulletin released yesterday still claims 75% efficacy rate infection. high amount breakthrough cases line 25% Look stats kids. risky Probably going end well state’s unvaccinated population, probably got it. seven months approved abroad. Great job, guys! It’s beautiful isn’t it? stupidest people country yielding exact results asked for. luck virus wipe altogether. Here’s hoping! *opachki* people masturbate this? says ""may"". means there's *chance* guarantee. seeing exact parroted nonstop last two days biggest morons know. general it’s hard upset everyone fight flight freeze mode ready go back worst case scenario. Immunocompromised people NEED vaccinated covid. may work well them, safe definitely recommended get it. Change title “Virus Spread LA driven mostly poor People Color” see would EVER get published.

Race baiting garbage. Tulane Green Fourth Wave Spreads easily chickenpox Jesus Christ. gotta wipe food deliveries Clorox time? Lol Unfortunately planet needed shift left. Makes sense far right dying now. left best. right wanted die. Stupidity trumps all. Laughs SC's 17.5% 15% last two days. FML Yea, that’s two distinct political parties. No, that's they're saying. data showing asymptomatic people large nasopharyngeal viral load (10x vs ancestral strain) spread virus easily unvaccinated people.

That means need nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI, aka masks) contain spread. Vaccines alone sufficient stopping spread delta. mean dumbest state America  80% efficacy, Rt&lt;1 fully vaxxed. basically disagree you.

In case, slowing spread probably good enough. people willingly get sick, immune population grow. *woosh* brother sisters need stop kissing cult leaders Fox News tell get it. Oh give break. argument us pursuing meassures prevented heard simply statements find annoying and... hell whenever opens mouth pretty much. us expressing exactly upholding speech argument.

The point isn’t whether God actually exists. point people believe also believe God wants specific, horrible, things. way forward convince they’re wrong believe, they’re wrong big boss wants. Yeah even selfish standpoint might best share countries enough, virus transmogrify Gamma Deluxe variant vaccines protect against. 74% group live Mass, 74% entire 882.

People getting 'info' Facebook pathetic.


What happens combine three?


Because living south, there's plenty coworkers bring things popping Facebook work, discuss saw FOX Newsmax night earlier.



And ""doing research"" count getting info Facebook? Two mine 12 too. Hoping vaccine comes soon goes smoothly all. Sorry man. doing?  Given experience isolated world large matches assume, one lacking perspective me. vaccine still blunts spread COVID country done part got vaccinated things would look lot better point. compare Northeast area high vaccination rates areas south low vaccination rates. fact vaccines work, 100% Delta reduced effectiveness work trying spin vaccinated responsible spread delta unvaccinated beyond idiotic. This. Anxiously awaiting approval. almost four year old another kiddo due November. want safe healthy all. potential variant going kids aren’t vaccinated utterly terrifying. Delta already slowly this. people get vaccinated, less people die. simple that. Besides, despite news yesterday, CDC bulletin still says delta variant, Pfizer still 75% efficacy infection 90% efficacy severe covid, still big numbers.

And look what's going hospitals almost everybody ICU unvaccinated. Also hospitalized could mean spreading effectively younger population, still same, near negligible rate complications. 🎶Sweet Home Alabama!
Where skies blue!
Sweet Home Alabama!
Covid's coming you!
Lord they're coming home you!🎶

P.S. Neil Young outlive inbred motherf*ckers. Alabama's finally first something! Sorry can't resist peddling Science Asylum much :D would wear mask outdoors? …… might confusing two. September submission EUA still target? sure check actual recent CDC study slide. vaccines still projected 75-85 percent effectiveness infection. know people commenting post saying prevent infection etc true. Doomsday LARPers taken yet I’m glad hear it’s working area! It’s terrifying people completely lack empathy. almost die lose loved one realize serious is. That's mean...the data behind slides USA, know we're pretty focused vaccine issue unvaccinated idiots preventing us herd immunity, sideshow? undeveloped world far getting vaxxed up, e.g. India (origin delta) immense population density. make mutations inevitable, put even USA mercy mutations be?

we can't give up, wonder really power determine two years.  people know much protection vaccines offer this? I'm fully vaccinated first time I've heard covid - also heard long-haul effects heart lung even asymptomatic. something want long haul, especially considering expensive medical care US. They're communicating business usual. dipstitt (pun...if know, know) governor made possible schools mandate masks vaccines. Ridiculous... disagree all. want vaccinated asap. I'm angry many others state ripped masks stopped precautions. got J&amp;J educator teacher push I'm super nervous. know do. I'm young healthy, know determinator sickness severity point.

I around middle school high school kids day soon. I'm debating trying lie get Moderna/Pfizer like countries done AZ, J&amp;J says effective still.

Any advice?? I'm nervous. Surprised public knowledge within country. going awhile. Companies state pretty much same, working... three employees dragging feet, one almost lost spouse, two want get weekly tested. know virus transmitted everyone regardless vaccination status

And vaccinated people spread regional vs total lockdown

...in US, it'll ""none"". 3yo caught another 3yo daycare. symptoms, indication positive test. pretty bad headache ~10 days exposed, slightest, mild sore throat barely perceptible congestion lasted day two (im vaccinated). 5yo constant contact shown zero symptoms too.

I say affecting kids worse... going spread affect kids general. still low rate symptoms complications, catching spreading going show symptoms. lazy bums... 

/s CDC still cites 75-85 percent protection infection. Also study say definitive transmission thing. preliminary. know today confirm something one way another. would collect research tell you? would tackle issue? government mandate masks countless people would died.  PLM

(Pathogen Lives Matter) Same, read like; uh already know come damn sky falling. truly bizarre.  school board communicating either? really frustrating. roommate can't kick without 30+ days notice many states. rights even cemented covid eviction moratorium, lots rights may aware No, couple reasons: 1) we’re almost certainly going boosters within couple months give significantly stronger protection Delta, 2) main goal CDC’s announcement Tuesday seems containing community spread Delta much concern mutating turning another (even worse) variant agin. I’m sure know, spreads, chances mutate create variants (hence Delta). obviously know can’t fully contain it, take measures try stop spreading unchecked know vaccinated people spread unvaccinated. CDC said briefing Tuesday, virus could mutations away evading vaccine. Ah, thank you! :) Pretty much fucking everywhere, believe answer.  surprising thing seem assume virus eventually entering bodies interacting immune system (which assume asymptomatic reasons) probalby damage much simpler interaction mRNA vaccine lead unspeakable damage like becoming gay liberal. seems like could remain mostly neutral letting local governments set covid policy.  able keep base appear reasonable enough maybe pick independents.  seems like better strategy.  maybe he's afraid McConaughey running, hope does.

so ironic Republicans complain Federal overreach States business, Republican Governors overreach local government business. Flu.  


No vaccine 100%. Per reason don’t need constant boosters mass vaccinations mostly eliminated diseases. Unfortunately, viruses mutate rapidly always require boosters/ repeat vaccinations (like flu). measle outbreaks, recommend booster shots adults. thing corona virus body impacting, everyone eleses, [You might want look general, agree you, seem like concerning trends happening need longer. We’ll know science bears out. 

You’re adult version “are yet’ing” pandemic child would say parents 99,647 times long drive. hard believe Alabama one hold state something bad shit crazy. former Alabamian I'm honestly gobsmacked they're hopping pickup trucks rounding people vaccinated throw onto bonfire something Fuuuuuuuck countless studies

cant wait see totally cherry picked peer reviewed examples back statement... ETA: downvote, 

Get used sub, especially daily discussions. dominate group vaccinated (good) want everything 100% back pre-pandemic right regardless everything going on. comment pushing gets downvoted. Also, people acting like political party conspiracy without specific since results comments getting removed. I'm really sympathetic towards willfully choose get vaccinated even though simple. extent would mandatory vaccines be? Yes workplace/school may make requirement, like flu vaccine, religious exception plus money hungry lawsuits various freedom organizations.
Yeah, think mandatory going successful. They're already wrong, numbers right now. 92K yesterday alone, without 5 states even reporting numbers. I've COVID. know lot people COVID. Almost nobody catches suffers long term side effects vaccinated. run several 5ks actively playing sports since got COVID. think evidence support big enough problem justify public policy restricting rights anymore. Likely infectious = easily gets body/makes person sick, transmissible/contagious = easily spreads one person another. ways this. need different targets virus manner HAART HIV. AFAIK, one drug pipeline Phase III. people likely die unvaccinated.

The people likely unvaccinated conservatives. 

Imagine politician killing supporters take cheap, short term win.

Even cynical, calculated perspective, idea assholes want enable supporters die thousands deadly ones kill hosts spread far. matter time virus mutates something infectious mild. 6 months 10 years? one knows.

Look Spanish flu example. time became less deadly eventually became part yearly flu strains. people want hear sold vaccines means back normal now.

But decade, history tells us covid another flu, likely integrated yearly seasonal flu vaccine, people catch deal like 2020. think silly. course vaccines effective, guy open feels like humans given current situation, reververating anti-vax sentiments. Downvoting shouldnt reflex that. Extremely small sample size. I. Hate. People. public health choice. refuse chemo die cancer risk spreading cancer stupidity. stupid analogy. Grow up, get vaccinated, stop spreading MuH fReEdOm bullshit. No, we're considering amending schools. know distinction important distinction. Kids dying that's point. UK sticking 8 week Pfizer gap 2 doses. determined 8 weeks sweet spot Pfizer allowing early doses that. 

They stockpile 10 million doses ( least 5 million Pfizer least 1 million Moderna ) distributed it. started donating doses 3rd world rather allow early doses. J&amp;j... believe makes least protected delta variant 3 question UK: Republican politicians want kill people voted them?  certainly ""we"" regardless whether included comment directed get steppin'. can't fix stupid. really can't. always can’t use fact one molecule can’t integrate genome proof another, delivered entirely differently completely different concentration, integrated. plenty transposons integrate without classical retrotransposase, example. probably biologist, promise peer-reviewed biology journal world would allow author try use standard proof. 

The reality extremely unlikely vaccines could integrate genome, there’s scientific proof many different types there, statement title needs addressed scientific rigor rather vague assumption. Purely thought experiment:

Take smokers US put jail 30 days. leave anytime, can’t smoke 3 days first.

Now take antivaxxers US thing, leave anytime take vaccine. 

I think less percentage smokers antivaxxers end 30 days.

It’s ideological thing imho harder uproot even physical addiction. He'll blame immigrants Biden it. keeps mutating getting better infecting vaccinated transmitted vaccinated. starting look like covid 19 could covid forever. supposed spike lifted mask mandate months ago, never came. Long covid, estimated ~10% cases (maybe 5% cases 20s)?

A colleague weeks long covid, unable work. Several friends kind milder long covid, mostly extreme fatigue, even year getting infected.

And no, vaccine protect long covid -- data recently came shows rates long covid vaxxed vs unvaxxed.

How concern literally might unable work go disability (and reduced quality life) something remote edge case?

Whoever told common cold point vaccine...is misinformed. what. goddamn summer people getting vaccinated left right. really expect people stay locked home forever?

Also young people likely safe. True data vaccinated people getting long Covid? important note cannot infer anything vaccine efficacy numbers missing two major numbers (neither ever know)

1. vaccinated vs unvaccinated percentage population time (not city event/outbreak including everyone travelled in)
2. number people exposed get infected

500 infections sounds like lot there's way know vaccine stop 5,000 infections occurring.

Another point viral load since looking symptomatic infections necessarily mean vaccine protect spread people. says get breakthrough may able still spread (there needs work done show detected virus actually live though dead/neutralized). 

Basically point comes study almost completely blind asymptomatic exposed vaccinated individuals mostly get tested. Without random testing population way extrapolate data further.

That said, important data analyze definitely least provides insight CDC worried may suggest change strategy 8 weeks still protected. pfizer booster suggested 6 months 2nd dose. Abbot *knows* needs trump's cult win again, gerrymandered shithole, possibility comforting. little point. circulate people didn’t take free vaccine won’t take steps necessary distance mask. Beyond that, end? slows ramps again. way train vaxx infection. Vaccines work, PREVENTING DEATH…not infections spread. 40% efficacy Delta isn’t “working” especially 30% US refuses vax. antiviral would purely defensive, someone already infected. suppose could also reduce spread level. mind making “less big deal” get Covid individual level. Headline: Texas Governor admits trying kill Texans. low potential. concerned, means whatever feel necessary. I'm asking justification unusual restrictions rights American citizens. Even mask mandate unusual restriction unacceptable outside extraordinary circumstances. last year+ pandemic counted that. disease less ~.00001 percent chance sort real harm, well Americans, qualify extraordinary. People die illness. happens. People dying alarming rates COVID vaccinated.  live Jersey, one bluest states ever completely understand saying. 

There house block still Trump flags out, complete trailer Trump-Rambo. Vaccinations increasing NY well. Delta scared people straight.  Lol you’re screwed either way. cancel normally ffs  going actual consequences facebook fox news propaganda time. cool! thought severe symptoms. 
do info much helps? correct, definitely could still got it. fight referencing fear immunocompromised unvaccinated sister getting covid well almost dying like almost died.

I absolutely know contract virus spread still vaccine. vaccine helps lowering possibility dying.

So point was, wouldn’t panicking hard vaccinated vaccinated. Covid aside; kids ALWAYS brought home something every cold season. Masks kids could help skip that. Similar “fiscal responsibility”. soon want it, sudden there’s money it… Let willfully unvaccinated die. somewhat agree think still take every measure limit exposure every age group eligible vaccine. mean honestly real lockdown would put halt regardless R value. (I know that’s unlikely doesn’t make statement untrue). sue? promoting bioterrorism! main mod /r/Vegas runs Facebook page puts pretty dubious statistics state local epidemic - stats reposts several times week sub. Today declared Washington Post New York Times [biased inaccurate sources Covid ) SMH whole point vaccine need worry infection. Even get infected again, give shit? almost certainly hospitalized die. That's vaccine does. He's Monster party monsters. Republicans done one thing represent People's interest since forever. Username checks (or doesn't?)  Well, living country 7-days record 45% positivity. still made quite lot tests time. could crazy covid going completely unvaccinated country gov decided ""we need Christmas without lockdown"". Reviewed CDCs new data reasoning behind new guidelines I’m skeptical.

Out 161 million US residents fully vaccinated July 19, 5,601 caught severe breakthrough infection hospitalized — infinitesimal 0.0035 percent protected population, according latest CDC figures available post-vaccination infections.

When comes deaths, risk even lower, 1,141 vaccinated people dying COVID-19 breakthrough infection — 0.0007 percent fully jabbed.


The CDC overzealous guidance DuhSantis coming around though since finally realized it’s lot Republicans getting sick dying vs Democrats mostly wear masks and/or got vaccinated. Sort matters elections literally 50.5% 49.5%. 

Some Republicans going lose elections year next literally helped kill supporters. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Texan, true. rapid Carlson fan's votes course. HIPPAie relieved proved wrong.

You're right, though. beyond belief, getting worse. Best tell, cult actually growing.

\-Texan gentle breeze? Believe not, power loss problem people dying? 

Myocardial damage, brain damage, lung scarring inflammation, kidney damage, neurological damage, early indications links increased incidence dementia loss IQ.  that's cases survivable necessarily need hospitalization.

Having friends family members gone long-covid months still classified mild.... special kind stupid care getting spreading this. It’s late. quick walk pharmacy Walmart. Even one provides substantial protection gives body chance fight survive. new variant joke. Even us vaccinated getting mildly sick. policy strictly urban areas infect quickly making rest Texas look bad comparison. Abbotts fck right couple generations. saw guy commenting somewhere day reddit saying grew Tater, went college all, always dumbass racist. 

I've watched reactions covid awhile, confirm dumbass part witnessed anything racist yet. I’m taking weekend sub, possibly straight deleting Reddit days. 

I need mental health break Covid related content. Florida 56 daily deaths par places like California recording 47 day. wish Biden would issue executive order prohibiting Governors issuing executive orders prohibit cities requiring masks, vaccines. Even troll GOP think misunderstand me. What's happening Delta Florida going happen everywhere. difference places release data. age statistics hospitalized please?

This, age statistics published.. Sit back watch 'em burn folks! work well preventing death, infection, spread.

If need alarm, mask mandates back areas lead science instead ignorance? agree anti vac people take pills ?  Yes agree. Masking point important. Restaurant retail need flip switch now. Fooling around even days wise line thinking part problem. Covid fucking care done. Grow up. Interesting follow up- Walmart requiring office workers vaccinated: Yeah big logical leap 3 months coughing lifelong crippling fatigue. Could even imagine another 4 years Trump? can’t, won’t. It’s terrifying close got. New York County currently “substantial” category per CDC. may part reasoning mask mandate. overall safety protocols also re-evaluated performances beginning November 1st date gets closer, it’s meant permanent means. must Florida. wore two masks everywhere, vaccinated, went see friends haven’t seen 3 years. Anywhere went outside, please keep high mighty Reddit. totally better person it. can't get adults wear masks. I'm sure kids much better.   makes statement see people vectors disease first, human beings second. Des Moines opera put concessions outside building allow come inside lobby theater, absolutely amazing. could true high vaccinated areas. 100% folks vaccinated, 100% infections come vaccinated individuals.

They likely mixed 75% effectiveness, means vaccine effective 75% rate. Much better odds vaccine, ideal. Two weeks left new school year kid …FML dunno we’re gonna Banjo playing jeopardy won’t, you’re living fantasy pretending will. right here. Fall going hell. I'm Springfield Missouri kids starting end hospital Yeah, Alberta Saskatchewan stopped requiring positive cases isolate, provinces eliminating restrictions people coming in, means might see national problem them. also plans September, completely non refundable, unless actual lockdown. travel insurance, doesn’t cover choose cancel / postpone safety. Stay safe! Media health organizations need start unified approach messaging around breakthrough cases. 100% understandable COVID variant carries 1000x viral load initial virus causing breakthrough cases, mean vaccine effective. 

It never getting 100% vaccine could automatically erase virus - hell, J&amp;J vaccine miracle prevented like 67% (I'm relying memory, could wrong) cases? talk COVID cases ""breaking through"", public's trust vaccines goes down. 

I'm really glad convinced mom (who conservative) get vaccine news came out, know could convinced present get it. end game re-election. entirety plan. Many die.  got covid bf ordering food going outside grab it. driver masked January probably alpha. that's contagious alpha omg Delta bad. question is, majority even care? Im sure catching surviving Covid badge honor loyalty many. Well, could worse... could live Mississippi... FML Yeah guess lot people elsewhere summer anyway. either/or. issue heart inflammation detected 6 weeks approval 12-18 year olds. Gullain-Barre much later.

I might wait bit getting kids vaccinated. Depends bad community transmission time. delta wave peaks end August like countries, Pfizer approved September, see rushing get it. He's got company Florida places. vaccinated others. people supposed anything ever again? Tennessee pedophile . fixed headline ya ! Americans going wake see policies working? 600,000 Americans died Covid-19. average American aware that, compared countries, that's insanely high number? can't imagine going school work people maskless pandemic. Whether vaxxed not, still spread virus. governor criminal responsible many people's deaths.  narrative be, e.g. “Abbot Goes Liberal”. mean, problem is, indoor concert, full capacity, everyone's masked properly entire time (just assume sake argument), that's kind of...not effective stopping spread. 唔見棺材唔流眼淚 Anyone really surprised back water yeehaw state really ranked like this? sure aren’t. two coworkers, think making things up. think could misinterpreted something. You’re lucky friends vaccinated. mine aren’t get upset don’t wanna hang. otherwise reasonably intelligent people (CPAs, junior executives, like)… can’t figure wrong them. Darwinism action! able read bottom getting paywalled, overall article light content. think interesting snippet doctor spoke thinks states cases surged may already reached peak, would encouraging true. Yep. thoughts really remain private, sometimes ignorance really bliss. It’s time vaccine passports. Delta making happen need simply clinical it. heard seen shortage vaccinations area WA. pharmacies letting anyone walk get one since seem many distribute. Please share evidence could happen kindly share misinformation. must missing it; seeing R0 @ 10? 
I hearing 8 weeks nothing materials / article points higher that. 
I specifically looking page 15 CDC slide deck Delta shown anywhere 5 8ish. neighbor like NY now. drinks kool-aid thinks DeSantis wonderful, great job handling things. virus bearing travel plans. Cases Australia shown it. never Delta NZ, community case Covid since February. like 'normal' human life experiences.

S\*\*\* happens. Positively reinforcing stupid behavior. understood personal freedom bare minimum. hear goetlib hope he’s right feel isn’t something say confidently. Like wouldn’t surprised every months see waves get smaller smaller magnitude don’t think they’re necessarily going small would like. don’t think that’s reason freak reinstitute changes daily life unless hosptial system start collapse. least seven states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Montana, Oklahoma Utah -- enacted legislation year would restrict public schools requiring either coronavirus vaccinations documentation vaccination status.  Sounds like Texas camp via executive decree. anyone know tourist could get Pfizer vaccination Turkey visit? document also provided concrete numbers breakthrough infections, estimating current levels, 35,000 symptomatic breakthrough infections per week among 162 million fully vaccinated adults U.S.

For worth 0.02160493827160494% breakthroughs weekly. Sure, there’s nuance efficacy. 75-85% kind symptomatic infection highly effective. Hospitalization death vaccinated people reduced almost nothing.  forecast anything 60% decline 140% increase. We're 500,000 cases per week presently. Harbinger Death nothing intellect everything popular culture. key thing still well protected severe symptoms disease

This rub. Half US vaccinated won't, huge amount country children, go back school. Woof. Thanks info. also minimal testing/contact tracing.  last checked 10% canadians mixed matched.The majority pfizer/moderna, good chunk got az/pfizer az/moderna. 

I mean, really choice. people, vaccine site, standing leaving unless second shot first shot... heavily chastised. Like people online media attacking ""vaccine shopping"". 

Turns maybe smart thing travel reasons. think less alot people personally know apologize, tired keeping short sweet. article indicates vaccine focus it’s hands effective method. Still incredibly effective. “We” refers Americans. Masking common sense practices bridges across time takes folks get vaccinated :). interesting read! Essentially point shouldn’t nothing. Gotta get Andy Kennedy bring back [Randy sketch Blazers vaccinate. republican friend whose whole family completely fucked week. fear, suffering, can't breathe, high fever, shitting (weirdly, shitting somehow). going 10+ days 1 person partially recovered, except still can't breathe right.  


republicans really getting fucked people trust. i'm enemy guess. neighbors voted past 40 years! Sorry situation, though. Well, vaccinated outdoors- would going beach safe. Damn, work mall. arkansas. I’m screwed Insanity Let’s hope so. think accept really won’t know happens. Nobody thought would see wave bad widespread vaccination are. Yeah seriously, loose along way, well could done better, sure best could... Right?oh. Anyone know unvaccinated people got alpha variant getting infected delta? Asking antivax laws life... kids, really sympathize you, wish children could get vaccine right now. Smells like bullshit. Either GMA letting crazy people write show, coworker making shit up, misheard. Facebook made like real-world friends less, more. shit-canned looked back. mom told read case 63 year old vaccinated woman getting severe symptoms Delta variant....wtf about?! thought vaccine supposed prevent severe symptoms! Yeah. totally new me! reasonable point view (and thus, get downvoted sub), negates possible hypocrisy. hypocrisy really drives wild. Certain groups government staying lives... **they** want force something force lives, they're totally cool it. drives insane correct response based science.

Abbott going science CDC world. Yeah 2004 think deadest happen fattest again. Oh, fantastic. Again, money safety cultists. Wow. unexpected. could possibly thought Monica Gandhi’s Twitter good place start Gottlieb interview every days could hop google search name they’ll He's trying really hard legally massacre citizens. Actual pediatric hospitalization numbers increasing faster UK previous waves. pediatric beds Oklahoma, kids transferred Texas. 25 year olds. N95s way go man. They’re back stock Home Depot/Lowe’s. Paywall Die Texans die, administrator hospital explaining matrix created triage covid patients. People factors likely contribute positive outcome would treated ahead less likely survive. assume vaccinated included factors spoken recently it. completely fucked thought Atlanta deltas stronghold trust government listen anti-government government lie basic health safety die  Extra cautious guess extra caution life + masks, that's bad ...That's bad. Well corona gonna help us cruise way herd immunity one way other. /S thinking, I'm thinking? take, admitted armchair epidemiologist, see quick resolution Delta. 
India saw wave hit course roughly 3 months. 
How US’ dramatically higher vaccination rate dispersed population affect wave remains seen. 
The UK appears similar 3 month trajectory, maybe Delta brings, regardless vaccination rates. 
It would certainly align known fact spreads extremely well amongst entire population. 

If feeling discouraged disappointed, know aren’t alone. 
I cancel kids’ summer camps, devastate wallet. 
I also considering options school year district shut choice remain virtual - week ago wasn’t even considering since things community still quite good. 

This end, meantime take vaccines offered, vigilant interact much able, mask outside immediate nuclear family.  Yeah smell bullshit People don’t agree CDC advise. Idk you’re surprised. CDC aren’t infallible. question legitimate.
According [UK's official UK 71.4% population fully vaccinated (and 88.4% taken least one dose). makes much sense. Agreed. see giving $100 us already part helps though. Unfortunately idiots shown free vaccine enough, government considering bribing anymore... Both. misleading person concerned kid wants know chances ok happen catch Delta. Delta cases could easily go back near future, especially social retrictions abandoned. idiots states?

What people common Alabama! True Also good news less people dying. He, like shit head Republican politicians, much vaccinated. honestly wish engagement like asking people. seems like lot people sub attempting engage larger awareness terms literal unvaccinated humans (not Americans) earth looking forward time future virus.

My issue right one thing - 9 year old 6 year old cannot vaccinated. They're still wearing masks, I'd love could avoid virus vaccination. way things looking, may possible. We're taking unnecessary risks, we're also shying away letting things kids enjoy like friends over, going beach, pool, playing softball.

Since see guidance CDC literally anyone working offices THAT'S probably unnecessary risk all, can't take seriously public effort curb risk. ""fine"" get train bus go office strain/variant virulent contagious zero legal support keep getting fired refusing so, nobody really gives flying F take home kids. entirely incumbent upon decide risk take learn, again, America, really money political risk.

Okay, means look science take matters hands, wife. go concert yet?

No. kids vaccinated. going wedding two weeks since decided to.

If vaccinated, think we'd go. don't, calculation? saying bigger family get-togethers things everyday life? ones stop altogether we're going certain functions events? 

And *our* blind spots? things we're selectively seem like good COVID avoiders simply paying lip service mish-mash misguided decisions avoid crowds?

I feel part saying applies anti-vaxxers. bad them, personally, understand anyone think going happen even every adult U.S. vaccinated now. BILLIONS unvaccinated humans COVID find infect spread among probably continue years, decades. mean get vaccinated? course not. I've fully vaxxed months.

But also means spread delta can't blamed entirely unvaxxed people Missouri Arkansas Florida. really think avoidable we're going see ups downs terms positive cases pay way attention amount vaccinated people hospitalized. think literally important metric right now.

Also, signs variant become infectious deadly children cannot vaccinated yet. inform parents decisions schooling prior vaccination.

These two things we're currently trying get handle seeing get control would bad. We're going stamp virus, imo, much better job letting people know signs - real time - vaccine protections seem waning.

Why hard get granular info vaccinated hospitalized outcomes? hard get granular info Delta affecting children versus OG strain? seem like thing thrown faces near constant basis scare shit us total number positive cases? hard find context can't find it, many people time sit figure context own.

So, finally answer question, 'ending' kids vaxxed... we're consistently given useful information go daily lives.

So yeah... never. basically us engage daily risk mitigation using knowledge that's there. prohibit businesses enforcing mask mandate, prohibits cities forcing businesses force mask mandate smokers even pay higher rates? There's really alternative. economy(s) stall without schools watch children. I'm frustrated Federal Government dragging feet ordering booster shot. Lots articles showing reduced efficacy shots 6 months. get idiots never get shots, least help people trying safe responsible. ""Is *really* hard wear mask? ***I*** even notice on. *We already require people wear clothes pants!*

And completely flabbergasted say ""well, yeah, is."" fine two weeks, getting pretty old time December rolled around, surge vaccines available yet, well worth then.

But now, year half later? Nah. mask offered additional meaningful protection, maybe I'd look differently. I'm vaccinated, additional protection would give meaningless. inconvenience absolutely nothing me.

These people act like masking absolutely zero downsides, flat wrong. Comparing wearing mask wearing shirt laughable. Like yeah, I'm sure easy wear mask get groceries delivered, work home, never leave house. bet 2020 fuckin' breeze you, wonder want go back it.

If still feel unsafe, mind wearing mask, fucking ***great***. M95 masks protect wearer even nobody else wearing one, strap one mind fucking business. antivaxxers care about, me. Anytime talk non-Americans, always reference Alabama place stereotypes prominent. go-to shithead state. Fuck Greg Abbott fuck Ted Cruz, hate elected officials :( democrats killing future anti republican voters. guess question EVERYBODY'S mind what's gonna happen next? take demask again?

Is percentage population vaccinated? happens reach that? 

Do need certain case rate? rate? long need stay rate demask? 1 week? 2 weeks? 1 month. 6 months?

Are gonna go every winter? ""Just case"". 

IF mask, what's metric used?

I think idea anymore. bad news zero optimism? can't see mandate ending year. UK Gottlib (sp) data correct. spoke last late August early September. Kids back school now. Damn sure unmask than. Sounds like even emergency approval happen October/November best case. unmask kids approved vaccinated. That'a 2 months. brings us January. Last year's spoke still humans! governor, Kim Reaper, vacuous twatwaffle handed position Moustache got free trip China. Can't wait see go. SMFH war changed, Discussion Thread still thinks big deal. also nothing red tide issue happening right well. 

Our department sent memo university ""normal 2019 operating procedures"" two weeks. two weeks room hundreds people masks vaccines mandated. university says state laws hands tied. Recent data similar Pfizer shot showed slight reductions protection symptomatic disease 6 months, still pretty strong protection still strong protection hospitalization death. Nobody wants covid, vaccination really ""just flu."" lucky get sniffles, unlucky feel like shit days fever aches stuff (like flu). But, like flu, possible unlikely end hospital bed. shame public officer.  tale old time mandate covers campus staff, well market, regional divisional employees work multiple facilities, Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said memo Friday. Walmart spokesman couldn’t immediately say many people entails. policy includes new hires well. 

**Walmart separately told frontline store warehouse associates Friday masks again** , doubled cash incentive it’s providing employees get vaccinated $150. Well shit  Ah yes, putting decision hands people strong political beliefs. could go wrong matter think think, point without knowing population data useless determining vaccine efficacy.

It still important observational data could potentially warning sign, way determine anything vaccine efficacy this. Especially since conclusions people drawing go studies actual quantify vaccine efficacy show little decrease due delta Gov. Brian Kemp care. confirm. I'm MD. amount international travel area insane. hit us hard fast. Luckily kind closed somewhat early. 

But making simplistic conclusion deaths per capita same, comparable performance State Governments would poor reading data. 

Because like said, rural areas get impacted much naturally distance, wave came months later, sometimes 7 months, better medical protocol infrastructure, people lot warning. 

And get demographics lifestylism. Utah example extremely young population, secluded mountains. statistics course would demonstrate that. 

Rural states lean old largely retired, obviously stay home. areas difficult manage urban working class areas average median age busy economy. 

And yet, Republican States still top charts, despite advantages. so? Unvaccinated people died vaccination around. people care then. Fucking moron  Honestly, there’s many reasons pandemic got bad America one biggest reason terrible communication. political leaders, health institutions pundits bad faith actors. Communication crucial crisis breaks hell breaks loose confusion leads death. lot go wrong crisis went wrong America. hate here. 😑 Hope dies covid Live Dallas. Apparently governor DeSantis competition see kill citizens.  sexually active gay man living predominantly gay area…if vaccine tested proven people got vaccine didn’t die HIV full FDA approval absolutely would gotten it. People Parkinson’s also suffer loss smell death nerve cells. symptom would indicate brain damage ""Walmart, Largest U.S. Employer, Saves many Staffs lives""

Fixed could consider that, doesn’t help conversation. someone’s say (whether true false) doc said something, ends convo right there. can’t refute telling doc wrong still get vaccine…. rich seniors.

The places setup vaccination vaccine first came wealthy locations. One homebuilder community received campaign donations from.

Nah he's scumbag I'm voting again. Amazing still understand difference ""infectious"" disease one isn't. 

Like think since freedom shit house walk shit lawn ""freedom""? Abbott know red voters die well. That's says. says city, state, etc can't force business mandate masks.

Businesses still free choose mandate masks. number irrational people playing 'game' believe win/win possible. you?

(game Game Theory; irrational would-rather-be-dead-than-inconvenienced) roll tide! &lt;- visual explanation  Ashish Jha called data “reassuring” last night.

Delta effectively turned covid flu *for vaccinated*.

For unvaccinated, going bloodbath. 

The **only** solution get people vaccinated.

We need keep eyes prize. Special kind stupid  can’t wait get American-made variant. imported crap countries can’t afford vaccines. leaving individual citizen? Limited government also making sure individuals rights upheld, overturned brooked cities, towns schools. Yeah, they're usually also anti-vaxxers, ""just flu"" denialists. mask become evil? dumb mofo killing fanbase. Oh well.  So, going start treating guys like Abbott like actual murderers? He's literally setting situation people obviously die 100% avoidable deaths willfully preventing sort meaningful measure keep deaths happening.

This mass murder political means, pursuit political agenda. GOP politicians literally facilitating deaths American citizens, definitely first instance it. fuck tolerating murderers allowed operate freely country's government? asshats care many people kill name “freedom”?  hero! /s Yeah, show libs dying! asking evidence random mRNAs get integrated host genomes. any? concern trolling? 40 burger king's Chicago? post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* never going listen comply begin with.

And time around, they're ones reaping sow. vaccinated people die? few. know ones hospitalized dying far mostly unvaccinated.

People choices, choose remain unvaccinated, well, sucks suck. less people dying per case?  vaccine helps mitigate effects cytokine storm. doesn’t help boost people immune systems like normal vaccines. good info. information makes feel need mask again. vaccine probably keep alive doesn’t mean walk around outside get sick. never mean chance getting sick vs annoyance masking within range comfortable with.

Hopefully people get vaccinated people also start wearing masks 🤞 corporate? 1000s people ground stores? So, Delta spreading quickly vaccinated unvaccinated populations, ton people delta antibodies now. Probably running hosts. kids' school even offering remote option year. trying generous, unlike course.  Lt. Governor much worse. line likes Abbott, unfortunately. sure, pretty large outbreak ""cluster"" sure. think entirely unrelated: thought doctors etc. willing allow off-label uses (e.g., third dose) products full authorization. fact passive income like capital gains taxed lower rate income actually working tells rich fucking middle class. know even get facts, one side Definitely mechanic. fixed car. Mayo clinic ever done me? /s People really like hear anything suggests anything pretend got shots. frustrating watch mental gymnastics last year pointing COVID deniers. Hey least Texas gets it’s special independent grid dodge taxes regulations, right  CDC report shows 10% vaccine side effects adolescents serious  best state power grid. [beat]. power loss. Getting real close 70,000 since vaccination efforts started US. It’s little frustrating seems multiple sources say opposite variant mutation doesn’t sound like viral load less may case. concerned republicans winning. primarily concerned status within Republican Party. add Iowa dumpster fire. Good. Let us burn “Excuse shitlord, ACKSHUALLY hug mom without triple masking N95’s even though fully vaccinated? god damn plague rats!” Eons ancient alien civilization discover ended species they'll say stupidity. We're Pandumbic good homy Probably Bubba, works Cabellas, gun section. got data Fox News.  also done away pretty much measures protection much faster compared countries. Canada, everything opened up, better vaccination rate do, cases(minus Alberta) - regularly hitting 0 new cases Ottawa, yet everyone still masks there's still sizeable chunk eligible people waiting second dose. 

I mean, state pretty solid vaccination rate hard pressed find county positivity rate 3%. situation rapidly changing evolving, pandemics, worrisome see lot states start struggle again. schools going mass breeding grounds new variants, too. don’t know similar NHS graph. person Twitter (that Dr. Ding retweeted assume legit) took daily NHS pediatrics age groups data graphed comparing 2nd wave 3rd (current) wave England. That’s graph shown tweets top. good dog Love small government rite Rs?! know Broadway case movie theaters make money concessions (most ticket price goes studio cinema). Gottlieb seems like reasonable thinker pandemic, lot trouble getting 1 million per day make sense. January 2021, reasonably robust testing regimen saw daily deaths peak, 300k cases per day. Obviously, vaccines work well preventing deaths even symptoms, clear official case counts could wildly deaths remain low. Given US vax rate maybe 50-60%, would expect deaths least couple thousand per day (not hundred actually is) case growth really high higher January, especially since cases unvaccinated. January case numbers reasonably accurate, deaths way higher today.

So guess pick one. Delta variant driving kind case growth, incredibly non-fatal even unvaccinated. pick kind case growth implausible. They're saying vaccinated people get infected pass unvaccinated people get infected, risk infection identical groups. trajectory per capita matching Louisiana daily reporting. LA today listing 81.9 weekly 94.9 daily confirmed cases per 100k people. Since population FL 21.67 million, assuming 81.9 weekly &amp; 94.9 daily confirmed cases per 100k people would daily number 17,690 per day averaged week 20,565 per day non-averaged. 

That would put weekly total 17,690 * 7 = 123,830. be. There’s need take broad stoke approaches parts country high vaccination rates low infections.  Aka companies interest losing business places mask requirements interest employees enforce mask mandates. Good point We're seeing people got original strain coming Delta well. So, definitely antibody protection original strain, cross protection new variants, wonder strong protection is. furry knows shit, though. unvaccinated population also population want mask mandates. 

So let them.  pay fucking insane. make student VA absolutely comparable first topic masks. Requiring seatbelt requiring mask different. 

This isn’t *your* safety. safety people well.

Now, talking vaccinations - Texas already requires go public school. you’re anti-government anti-police move Somalia instead republic. end goal? replied article new report states need wear masks despite vaccination. Maybe read it. answer question, end goal everyone else's. Trigger what? mono virus. must system. would easy read (in conjunction previous header, “CDC COVID STUNNER” 🙄) conclude CDC dropped bombshell study finding vaccines don’t work Delta variant. 

That’s said it’s technically incorrect - it’s not, presumably refers fact vaccinated individuals spread Delta much *on chance get breakthrough infection.* public health policy standpoint, it’s important people realize vaccines *work,* work *really well* even Delta. “DELTA CONTAGIOUS EVEN VACCINATED” opposite. 

Dropping headline could easily misinterpreted worst possible way beyond irresponsible. Huh, guess watching since 2019 too! 
I thought really got serious 2020, remember Diamond Princess incident first “oh shit, real thing coming.”  starting feel completely hopeless. don’t think ever get half country assholes. Ironic ‘no new normal’ crowd everything possible ensure fact new normal. Beverly Hills yesterday saw plenty self entitled morons go maskless office buildings coffee shops.  *The order, Abbott said statement, ""provide clarity uniformity"" state's response coronavirus pandemic. governor claimed Texans ""mastered safe practices"" help prevent avoid spread covid-19.*

A month ago, 7 day average infections 1,091

As July 29, 7,777

Yep, ""mastered safe practices"" right door executive order. 


Good thing suppressing vote might see Texas turn blue. Always been. 

In lead American Civil War, states rights definitely concern. Specifically, northern states felt right say person within borders free man. southern states disagreed, [Fugitive Slave passed return escaped slaves South. South protested bitterly Northern states individuals flouted law tried circumvent it. States rights mattered South it’s right oppress people. Yes mutations random, transmissible mutation become dominant since outcompetes variants. wall still go up, Texas size dent it? want people die. problem wearing mask something? wearing anyways stops flu cold that's great. downside annoys people reason. 97% hospitalization? Man, Texas really hates people. can't small government dictating local governments can't do. Yep. I’m you. imagine toll opting social activities mask ones mental health great, person herd immunity whatever goalpost CDC throws us. see blue strongholds that, Houston, Dallas, Austin, etc. Yeah, bunch Canadians came it, went back home, logged reddit started talking shit us lol  Florida’s big brother baddie. weekly reports informative, Florida Department Health leader data reporting transparency throughout pandemic

Isn't Department Health state sent swat teams raid house whistleblower exposed fact giving misleading covid numbers look better actually were? Department Health? I’m Texas breakthrough covid. kids unfortunately symptomatic easy time, although I’m typically anxious person, levels roof right beds ICUs children’s hospital almost full. isn’t politics - it’s blatant negligence. Vaccination enough stop spread COVID many human beings dumb ignorance selfish.

Here, apply deep long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing HEK293T cells infected SARS-CoV-2, find virus integrated genome. examining ONT data separate HEK293T cultivars, completely resolve 78 L1 insertions arising vitro absence L1 overexpression systems. ONT sequencing applied hepatitis B virus (HBV) positive liver cancer tissues located single HBV insertion. experiments demonstrate reliable resolution retrotransposon exogenous virus insertions via ONT sequencing. find evidence SARS-CoV-2 integration suggests events are, most, extremely rare vivo, therefore unlikely drive oncogenesis explain post-recovery detection virus. county county customer requirement.

Many customers even enter store. local WM 10 spaces parking lot pickup. pull scheduled time, wheel wagon groceries, load car. Umm… republicans want to… oh nm Yeah, going believe? Mayo clinic mechanic watched YouTube video? times million. Dumb fuck Republican logic.

Don't tread me! tell gay people can't get married transgendered can't go military atheists can't get married people drugs and... thousand ways want government dictate lives you. 

They obviously keep voting Republican simply uneducated know truth. point, sheer racism bigotry hold party together. Fear newest enemy.

Border crisis! Critical Race Theory! Cancel Culture! enemy week? minority group? need direction focus fear stop able manifest earthly forms, suppose. even personal liberty freedom. want help save someone’s life want potentially cause someone’s death. That’s question.

If look statement closely, actually making argument personal choice. Meaning, person right make choice themselves, forced it. 

I believe crux argument governor, stance wholly disagree with. People shown time time fucking stupid selfish thus mandates place begin with. said, wish people wouldnt think vaccine = protected. lessens severity, bit mean get covid, mean spread it. unvaccinated people life, wear mask. one abbott wants make.  Duh. he’s even suggesting people wear masks outdoors. said “when indoors, outside home.” headline misinterprets actual recommendation. got vaccinated 

You high protection symptomatic Delta. extremely high protection serious illness Delta. EXTREMELY high protection death Delta.

The vaccines work. work almost good protecting Delta Alpha others. Unfortunately think that's case people. already good chunk denying facts start. another big chunk fatigued whole situation.  Gonna interesting day. wow remember early pandemic predictions saying anywhere 20 million 80 million people United States already contracted virus like March 2020. smart moves Texas see. Leading world stupidity.  agree. Masks something necessary mitigate risk. they’re needed again, it. they’re something wear taking part regular society attempting fun enjoy myself. Give Delta-1,Delta-2 time chnage.

Follow Math Science.

Brasil, India , UK Japan.

Mother Nature B\*\*\*\* ! It’s disheartening isn’t lot studies Delta children vs others. don’t know actually worse children it’s numbers game. Hospitals standardized code system though. supposed across country. Mine super early vaccination process pharmacies got involved Georgia. hospital running vaccination site Alabama started calling HR departments large companies Georgia within driving range offer employees since turnout low. 

In fact, turnout low site initial second dose scheduled Friday got bumped within time difference shot 1 shot 2 site basically forced go 4 days open demand low keep open M-F. late March-early April.  he’s even suggesting people wear masks outdoors. said “when indoors, outside home.” headline misinterprets actual recommendation. Damn shithole place live Well reading comment thread point made brain hurt.  

Congrats provided stupidest chain comments I’ve seen Reddit awhile.  shit, vaccinated people becoming contagious. selfish pricks prolonging pandemic indefinitely self-absorbed enough think government/anyone would put effort controlling paltry, pathetic little lives  Fine me. constituents want. Let reap sow  Texas, 

Where governor blames immigrants spread yet passes laws allow spread continue. absolute fucking idiots, guy  lol still listening CDC? touch stove see it’s hot yet? legit many leading scientists vouched takes. stays anonymous crazies Twitter tendency send death threats people support vaccines. Sooner later gonna “US Variant”. Wonder they’ll say then. think sarcasm Reddit social media. can't keep spreading even vaccines immunity, never going stop spreading. what's end goal? Mask life? think upside down. It'd 70 / [growth rate %] = doubling time whatever unit time rate attached Walmart requiring masks employees surging counties customers time. tells round mask mandates likely wide reaching last years. expect similar private companies coming days think customer mandates avoided stores like that. Thoughts? well significant number people get third dose table, assume people vaccinated not. delta spreads, vaccine efficacy falsely goes down, leads lockdowns mask mandates could unnecessary. yeah data policy makers important situation That's get reading. Typical Redditor part. case, can't think much besides delta variant Arkansas backwards hellhole outside major cities. sir? War…. War never changes…. Also consistently among states worst K-12 education tie #1 religiosity. Wrong. Excess deaths India period 3-5million higher expected, India's health system swamped clearly turned people away. 400k whatever they're reporting official tally, likely far lower reporting mechanisms also extremely flawed.

66% Indian population antibodies according recent study. much likely Delta blew threw third country killed 4 million treat science like politics- change signals weakness evidence past deceit.

And lot things blame includes many scientists (especially celebrity scientists TV twitter) claiming things absolute open discussion criticism. Many even established scientists let media politicians control narrative desire attention fear losing funding research. spread narrative accept whatever scientists say without question probably ironic gets. We've known weeks substantial risk transmission outside makes sense fucks credibility federal level public health even further

I think people need shut hell regroup anti-vaxxers field day conga line incompetence  Actually...yes, is!

Everything know suggests kids incredibly low risk disease. Everything know also suggests remote learning absolutely devastating. 

That's CDC American Association Pediatrics recommends reopening (with masks)

This sub weird thing treats every case COVID same, know incredibly well point COVID much dangerous people (the elderly, etc) others Alabama least lot things state.  They're putting everyone base risk catching it, spreading it, allowing chances mutate, simple that. SurprisedPikachu.png That's actually southern states think fighting mandates lol think added afterwards anyways would nice I'm thinking deniers go deeper denial... Like half country unvaccinated, new death figures India suggest around 4 million people died Covid country 66% population antibodies.

This means delta variant, short months, likely blew 950,000,000 people kill anywhere 3 5 million look excess deaths.

For long time Russia known could fulfill Sputnik orders Guatemala Brazil? introduced Sputnik Light (only dose 1) started investigate AstraZeneca second dose months ago. don’t understand forced vaccination solution. 

New data shows vaccines don’t prevent catching covid don’t prevent spreading it. 

But good preventing severe cases, hospitalization deaths. 

So anyone decides take vaccine protected. Whether people around vaccine matter since vaccinated people catch either. 

For people it’s choice point whether risk consequences covid not. 

So let people make choice?

The hospitalization rates low enough don’t need worry medical collapse anymore. 

If vaccinated nothing worry about. 

And vaccinating everyone going make covid disappear. article says, immunity something going happen. live cesspool. I’m vaccinated. Husband half vaccinated. definitely minority here. Donald trump one It’s we’re getting data Delta much fit variants, it’s replicate much faster result 1000x viral load faster. means get jump immune response (including antibodies neutralize) body ramps up. also means you’re infectious sooner, shed much virus variant got used last year. vaccinated people, immune system ramping may shedding enough virus infectious.  Correction : vaccinated 99.65% unvaccinated get Covid, avoid death. unvaccinated, small percentage chance get Covid. Therefore, unvaccinated, there's .03% chance die. co-morbitities percentage even lower. That's chance I'm willing take. soon till everyone recommended get third shot? Soooo moron says people trying get US Mexico bad might spreading covid... prohibits requiring masks vaccines... gonna help spread covid. Got it.

Also, seemed like going mild cold Tuesday. There's really reason believe delta surge, recede, surge again, like original COVID-19 variants prior vaccines rolling out. okay sad someone died people filled head poison lies. bad decision, also sad thing. Talking’ outta turn? That’s power loss. Basically world introduced trump. Ah, see. makes bit sense like ""You're subscribing belief tolerate!"". Still inexcusably stupid them, though. Fixed

War Covid get idea.

We're good things. moron told us state mandates start pandemic ""Texas big place community take steps mitigate covid-19."" 

Now whatever fuck say political career taking hit I'm hoping save me. We’re triggered didn’t understand point comment point Abbot/Conservative Hypocrisy. entire point comment. 

You assumed person anti-big government, think everyone anti-hypocrite. 2/3rds Indians antibodies means Delta blew 900,000,000 people months killed ten times official tally.

No, agree part. India pretty much unaffected COVID then. first major wave like 1% population vaccinated time. US 50% population vaccinated bunch already go virus first second waves. think big difference India US. Influenca epidemic 2017/2018, 18 weeks, 9444 extra deaths = 75 deaths/day

Influeza epidemic 2018/2019, 14 weeks, 2894 extra deaths = 30 deaths/day

Average extra deaths winter influenza epidemic = 6443

Source: forget take account 0% measures influenza epidemic except vaccin shots. first 9 weeks corona epidemic took 9768 people = 155 people / day. country full lockdown panic mode.

So point? Democrat voters next election, then. vaccine exposes body controlled amount spike sequence, allowing mount rapid immune response exposed real thing. initial viral load partly fully neutralized already-trained immune system, lessening severity disease.

If unvaccinated get infected, body rapidly exposed sequence anyway via replicating live virus. Adding vaccine mix anything helpful short term. Delta burn pop fast. putting head month two might viable strategy combined vaccination. looking chickenpox, everyone usually come contact eventually. Yes! family shared beach house together last week (they vaccinated well). One family members thought little cold, day trip lost smell took test. spread like fire us. whole week held onto hope of, “if stays away mask hopefully safe since vaccinated”…but late. stupidest part schools send students home shorts wrong length something. believe brief period following WWII conservatism pushed way left natural state conservatism. brief little flicker though. Based evidence? Wouldn’t name database sort?  thought might case significantly 75% vaxxed, numbers make claim. percentage vaxxed web somewhere?

Assuming 90% vaccinated, quick-and-dirty Excel gives something like 66% efficacy disease? Might math wrong. guys think another lockdown coming due tk delta variant?

I thought vaccines getting common things would get better Everything dumber Texas. area known substantially different demographics? sure find detail report. reasonable study done area meant wider implications. Yikes. Noone deserves die ignorant/stupid. Rather mandate vaccines then. won’t interesting. They’ll still vote in. know joking not, I've seen said unironically horrible place get news.

""Wikipedia best thing ever. Anyone world write anything want subject, know getting best possible information.""

-Michael Scott Better safe sorry? Masking easy, prove it’s needed relax versus wishing we’d known masked. Plus risk cost associated masking virtually zero.

Because studies take time. We’re really getting used laser fast publishing usually things take much longer 1-3 months we’ve seeing Texas shit show many ways! Israel offering adults 60, think. hospitalization. Vaccinated people get sick, they’re going hospital they’re dying significant numbers. vaccinated it’s “just flu”. CDC guidance buries lead: getting vaccinated ends this. president/CDC balls mandate vaccine. Thanks posting this. whole quote exceptionally point!! Great job thank you. vaccines prevent contracting virus, shield.

It reinforcements immune system battle infection. Therefore reducing severity infection, often times point asymptomatic. theory reduce viral load give contagious, everyone benefit, go back normal.

\- hospitalizations - **few deaths** thought chances breakthrough cases slim almost none? That’s Fauci said right? That’s vaccinated people didn’t need wear masks ?

also similar. However, microbiological studies required confirm  
these findings. 4 vaccinated hospitalized instance. believe zero deaths. think early delta wave look CFR. know soon though. here? I'm sorry. We're similar boat. Husband quit became stay home dad last year, now-2-year-old twins. start preschool, went one week came terrible cold (not covid, tested negative) figured there's chance preschool's safety policies keep delta. withdrew preschool going patch together grandma help part time vaccinated babysitter fall husband goes back work part time. 

Meanwhile I'm forced teach person university yet mandated vaccines students requiring masks either, moreover we're *not allowed require students wear masks classes office hours* also allowed inquire students' vaccination status. I'm going wear mask best big mess. 

Best luck guys figuring way forward. mean Herd Immunity?

I mean, imply unvaxxed cannot hide ""Herd Immunity Umbrella"" we-the-vaxxed provide spread virus? claim make think requires citation? article days ago saying Americans getting boosters bc they're scared Delta. comments said getting booster going another state get one. Honestly, probably significant enough make difference numbers. Basically idea vaccine make body think attack virus without actual danger. immune system kicks gear actual virus shows defenses primed 'overwhelmed'. covid real immune system already tried kick full gear vaccine make difference late. Five kids ages 17, 10, 7, 6 17 months... No, vaccines still presently effective. months now, even year? thing still replicating. can't reason want abandon ego disinformation. Alberta something nobody else though. Yep. I’m okay that. I’m locking shutting schools idiots might spared ""Grace God"" also involved knowledge work medical community quick dismiss, disparage denigrate got sick. Yeah. start wearing masks again, thanks stupid unvaccinated people!  Im going take wild guess assume we’ll see 200,000 day peak thing starts dive bombing back tell get wasted. USA land waste. don’t think anyone would logically argue that. wanted put person inevitably says “see, vaccine doesn’t work”. agree. yeah, there’s way significant number people 

“If you’re vaccinated others vaccinated need wear mask “


Except vaccinated people spreading covid. 

I thought point vaccines stop spread? True, booster targeting Delta help [The data shows protection mortality Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine even higher – around 69% – confirmed cases second dose least 7 days prior positive [**When combined estimated protection becoming case, equivalent estimated 97% protection** mortality individuals vaccinated 2 doses Pfizer-BioNTech 
 
*^((these pre-Delta numbers show even lower efficacy 
Between reduced efficacy Delta 2-dosed vaccinated person, waning antibodies time (not significant number yet), people vaccinated J&amp;J vaccine less effective *this* Delta, 1/5 Americans ""vaccinated"" merely 1-dose vaccinated.. stretch say vaccines national level reducing severity ~half. instead 1% mortality rate, looking ~0.5% mortality rate. 
 
The bread butter vaccine ability stop transmission. Reducing severity disease secondary feature. look graphs numbers promote efficacy vaccine, they're *mostly* touting feature resisting contraction. less meaning we're dealing breakthrough clusters. 
I hard time imagining cared 1% mortality rate last year one cares .5% mortality rate. 
 
And thought vaccine would reduce chance long-haul least half, that's symptoms. first data come (mostly older B.1.1.7 variant) suggesting [19% vaccinated people developing long term Surely numbers get accurate time *suggesting* chances long-haul COVID reduced even vaccinated. That's something worry about. Impressive. finally identified audience dumber Faux News viewers. care. won't, becoming endemic hopefully far less mortality aggregate Perspective, least regards breakthrough case hospitalizations... reason brought prior variants, vaccine lower viral loads vaccinated individuals. I’m highlighting understanding adapt evolving variants article reporting variety studies well quotes doctors. looks like studies patients hospitalized Covid reporting brain fog impaired functions, surprising - viral infection sends hospital going take long time recover from, may lead permanent damage. None unusual, vaccines good preventing cases serious enough require hospitalization.

The quotes doctors (who noted, even though experts opinions valuable, still speculating) range ""we know, we'll keep studying it"" ""I expect see permanent damage."" 

Basically, article uses real worrying data, vague interviews, turned scary article makes think ""covid causes alzheimers"" without ever actually stating even proving that. comparison flu based info Covid variants 2020. Already picture changing Delta - [overall still rare, hospitalizations going year compared flu. 

In countries resistance public health measures leading overwhelmed healthcare systems like Brazil example, Covid especially devastating pediatric population know exactly why. Covid variants new, point data still emerging. think precaution warranted. need complete isolation, masking reasonable precaution long term data. seriously I'm gonna get it. Lol Sorry, thought responding post itself, someone's comment thing I'm worried variant affects children 12 since two can't get vaccinated. expect world stop them, expect options plan place school starts NJ Labor Day. remote last year could another 2-3 months infections get hand here. know sucks teachers, perhaps breakthrough infection would worse? Tough say... I'm sure we'll still mask mandates distancing vaccines approved. 

I also expect returning office Manhattan riding Petri dish sit another Petri dish come back different petri dish one rode get option option protected law kids get vaccinated. 

Judging Cuomo said day, doubt be. things hate messaging, idea MUST send unvaccinated kids school also MUST return office. One things two things absolutely needs optional kids 12 get vaccinated. P-Town full old Victorian homes converted shops, restaurants, art stores. packed summer indoor venues tiny, packed, OMG crowded. Pretty sure contributing factor


Love visit, entering place tourist season like front 10 rows live concert It’s Christian camp, so…draw conclusions will. anybody help deciphering conclusions drawn *** section? people Arkansas dying then, since lower rates even seniors?  Thanks everyone, see error. Let’s run numbers, think metrics useful compare yearly numbers well I'm avoiding groups people. Unfortunately user friendly grocery pickup. I'm enabling suppress workers trying keep family safe. Options suck part reason generally talked would effectively reward people getting sick? we're trying avoid increase cases would seem counterproductive Yes, dealing today tomorrow. Dude, I’m PhD virology fuckin clue said 5, 4 vaccinated Really? still attach magnet skin months later /s Personally think higher chance dying warzone new SARS. that’s OP italicized *each year* Lol yea “centuries” ago. talking covid year mitigation rules truly living Happening. Damn M. Night possibilities exciting. scientists might also onto first successful RSV vaccine, flu shot that’s good known strains flu! always, country always reactive instead proactive. guessing it’s going live life. Politics start play bigger role. You’ll also see people sheltering decide miss human interaction, well non introverts. hope dedicated teachers that. teachers trying (hybrid model) awful. forget RT cameras rolling, distributing cheap PR effort around world.

As long news outlets keep ignoring massive catastrophe Sputnik issue causing Latin America, PR win Putin stand, even deliver single dose vaccine ever again. mRNA technology new all, studied scrutiny decades, thanks massive extent research allowed quicker adoption covid vaccines move huge clinical trials 40,000+ people met every requirement approval, global collaboration, funding barriers vast amounts independent health agencies reviewing every step.

Even vaccines corona viruses studied since 2003 following SARS outbreak. Nothing vaccine ""experimental"" company planned call everyone back Labor Day. don’t see viable anymore. Certainly wouldnt. we'd cruise past 90% think much likely contact tracing. Small bars everywhere. Gaming huge help! May well lay die dude.  People delayed surgeries treatments lockdown? clinicians know seeing later-stage cancer cases usual, due people missing regular check-ups treatments. guess anal sex transmits Maybe, maybe not. one hand present good point give probably true not. 

On however world always work way, year paid+ time work could invest time money worthwhile ventures know people squandering opportunity. would higher rates pre vaccination (bad = hospitalized)...I call BS thing everywhere thie planet, vaccine end game due anti-vaxxers country. Treatments, (before that, proper mask masking, distancing) final way out.

I know get saying breakthroughs common saying anti-vaxxers fault. 

Treatments might help, though we're long time still closer. people can't get proper masks use properly, distancing help much airborne virus, cutting social contacts longer fly wasted tool 2020 virus less transmissible (which lesson forgot 1918: always get worse, save things like masks things worst).

So endgame never everywhere planet live permanent part lives. getting makes later exposures less bad, we'll OK; later exposures get worse, we'll live lower life expectancy. getting rid virus completely impossible. 1 true regular covid, 2 true Delta. hope clears confusion. 

That's reason mask again. regular covid, vaccine decreased amount virus shed infected person 90%, CDC told vaccinated people take masks. we're finding that's true Delta. That’s I’m scared of! husband back work 2 year old cancer don’t want sick. We’ve done everything avoid it! Dad do/ family members vaccinated? That’s beyond unreal - news! course, sovereign individual rapist/murderer. What's point?

You're argument equivalent saying seatbelts useless still die wearing one. Yeah thanks thanks. I’m done. I’ve checked out. don’t get vaccine also don’t mask roll dice suffer consequences get sick. I’m gonna continue live life restricted fear others won’t part too. frankly I’m tired government putting burden back part instead people filling hospital beds. doesn’t require one sentence explain difference. simple greater coverage less coverage. I'm federal worker. Biden top boss. Like Christmas Eve Eve told us take Christmas Eve off. Yes, 99 June across hospitals. way “filled” article claims. 

Note article one largest prestigious media organizations entire world, even use misleading hysterical rhetoric describing current situation. somebody tell covid positive subreddit seem convinced vaccines useless delta variant? I'm guessing confirmation bias, still...  Bullshit Correct time record surge already heavily vaccinated people brushing ""well chinese vaccine doesnt work AMERICAN vaccine we're fine"" ~35% US population doesn’t listen science, fucked. absolutely transmit fully vaccinated. guess check back week find out. currently experiencing highest Covid infection rate one day right now. guess could start declining tomorrow.

Do think that's likely? lives outside.

Well **would** far efficient False. rare blood clotting disorders (TTS) - observed line would expected general population - crucially lower Covid-19 Lol you’re dumb realize you’re literally hurting goal mass vaccination. Great point. Can’t wait see insider trading come light. one makes Windows :b. Remind we're dead variant can't targeted vaccines. agree also disagree, Delta going burn rapidly based every area world got hit it. Areas like Florida already primed thick pulling delta peak end August. likely may pass end october-ish type preventative measure may reduce spread regions somewhat enacted. I’m scared this. It’s bad precedent set 100% vaxxed campus can’t remove masks. then? think got dad. vaccinated. came positive too. think dad got unvaccinated person workplace. firmly believe CDC behind data breakthrough infections. Including dad, know least 14 vaccinated people infected family group. separate other, incidently getting infected around time. local businesses shut today whole vaccinated staff tested positive. sending federal surge response team help hospitals. really getting scary here. Sounds like another way letting guests whatever fuck feel like. AKA wearing masks  Ditto made smile Agree 100% Someone please let patient know I'm furious too. “We learn live COVID*” *(heart conditions, lung scarring, possible dementia). everyone masked, would equal protection.

Given quality masks used, way they're used, really doubt that's true.

One weird things mask controversy way experts talk flaws cloth surgical masks, higher viral load emitted people Delta, act like masks vaccines can't. Maybe everyone wore authentic n95 masks, one get them.

My cynical view masks recommended check behavior; make indoor socializing less fun, people limit indoor contacts, may help cut spread. ... they're really good dragging feet. expecting approval sometime Sept? helping, think difference would super negligible without anyway. vaccine hesitancy botched roll Japan much bigger issue left vulnerable variant wave. Anyone asks tested tested, certainly. I'm vaccinated. mild cold symptoms, much less likely get spooked go get tested compared someone unvaccinated? People self-select. internet poll Fox news viewers junk. random selection. 

Also, show emergency room--unvaccinated--for laceration, they're going test covid. show vaccination card, going test me. That's understanding anyway.

Data clearly shows vaccinated people spreading Delta variant COVID, including vaccinated people, creating perfect breeding ground new variants escape vaccine protection. also shows even young vaccinated people negative health outcomes, including hospitalizations long term complications.

As soon went back work (he staying sister) “quarantine” period happened father dying going north “peace quiet”) “outbreak job” “caught” covid. didn’t realize outbreak. guess lied symptomatic getting tested got REALLY sick.

What removal interest student loans. Literally remove everything owed isnt principal. someone paid 40,000 back already ignore interest accrued count instead toward principal instead. removing interest accrued past future would make huge difference. 0% interest college loans future shouldnt people pay less people paid immediately took loans. know probabilities, right? 

I mean say something 100% disqualifies effect, sure hope shun antibiotics, forms birth control, vaccines etc.

Unvaccinated meaningfully higher risk show rather poor public spirit and/or math skills... neither something employees love hires. considerate nan endorsing 🤷 God punishing Alabama failing socially distance, wear masks get vaccinated. 😂 well done It’ll interesting see county seems one vaccinated. I’ll keep eye cases hopefully magically start falling. Here’s thing, though. clinical trials, (correct I’m wrong), Pfizer wasn’t routinely testing people, showed symptoms. However, J&amp;J was. lots people testing positive feel symptoms, that’s thing told us first got vaccines: still catch won’t feel it.

So publishing data won’t necessarily help could possibly even make people scared be. Especially lots people testing positive 88% (as found UK study) symptoms. read “kills” like “shit, Corona even killing hospital beds now?!” 
Enough Reddit today, brain stopped working. Please don’t “all lives matter” thing.

BIPOC communities continue lower vaccination rates, average, white communities, variety reasons. They’re also less likely able take sick time self isolate, likely live conditions Covid spreads rapidly.

Older adults disabled adults still likely groups die Covid. Even fully vaccinated people illnesses treatments immunosuppressive vulnerable hospitalisation death delta variant. Exactly. There's group saying nothing worry about, feel odds getting less odds bad reaction vaccine. Leaving things chance feels better knowingly fuck personal space! boundaries church! doubt.

CDCs data suggests likelihood vaccinated people getting breakthrough infection extremely low. Less 1% vaccinated people reported getting breakthrough infection. Getting infection serious enough cause hospitalization death even lower .004% vaccinated population.

But then, time information published, Walensky goes CNN tells people “1 2 people 20 get breakthrough infection”. That’s fucking nuts! 

This control flip flopping CDC it’s leadership helping anyone. you’re never interacting service staff? No, isn’t. It’s like people getting paid something need otherwise wouldn’t. Quit crying.

err side caution assume transmit Classical blame messenger. lay responsibility anyone people refusing get vaccine.  First, vaccine seem protect well delta variant. So, infections unvaccinated vaccinated people. everyone (kids years) get vaccination yet. So, yes, together.

Lol see hypocrisy? also assuming I'm anti vax absolutely case. want non political conversation. bad think side read delta, one minute exposure enough. ""restrictions widespread vaccine availability"" restrictions ""?????????"" find deeply unsettling.

If thought ended ""availability"" that's you. basic plan is

- availability

- widespread vaccination; ideally, everyone eligible

- virus spread, new case numbers plummet

- slower virus reproduction, slower rate mutation, longer amount time current vaccines remain effective

That gets us back flying level, matter maintenance needed: update vaccines new strains, temporary, seasonal / location base restrictions clusters emerge.

If metrics (e.g., case numbers, positivity rate) go low enough pull back restrictions again/more. Delta variant much transmissible, including via vaccinated, threw things loop.

I would surprised much dangerous variant emerges next 10 years. Hopefully, we'll better prepared then. myth (of vaccinated individuals shedding virus) almost dumb, dumber [fan honestly okay. Stores mandates unless majority states done it. May God bring so-called pastor repentance $100 doesn’t go far today used to.

Btw getting vaxxed silly all. literally best thing could yourself. want provide additional data point Singapore Delta dominating bit half population fully vaccinated mRNA increasing rapidly. 

This shows local cases last 28 days. test, quarantine contact trace pretty aggressively even completely asymptomatic, get tested identified close contact.

Well yes, course. seems like feeble effort that’s totally hands. think we're approaching time even vaccinated worry could well asymptomatically infected pass someone also vaccinated older compromised way. (Or someone would also asymptomatic could pass someone risk.)

And still know long COVID ""mild"" breakthrough infections.

Hope everyone enjoyed 10 weeks freedom! unvaccinated COVID patients* power politics.

God ultimate power, work nature it. pastor God's representative. pastor agrees health authorities means common sense superior pastor's word (which proxy God's word). Followers gain secondary power church pastor proving loyalty ie also ignoring common sense. vocal loyalty higher power. Getting sick, dying etc means victim loyal faithful enough. Win-win. structure religion God outside Nature. crazy. Disclaimer I'm vaccinated.


It Kinda concerns now, essentially CDC saying vaccines work. still get pass covid. 

Why mask vaccinated, work? [The Israeli study outlier screwed  reason need increase vaccination rates, protect risk Well according kurezgt body memory cells last long time problem however anti bodies don’t last long Also, strong risk becoming sterile due death Covid. yeah. son’s bus driver tested positive despite double vaccinated whole bus quarantine. I’m mad situation every unvaccinated person enabling ongoing spread COVID. Thursday, 882 people tied Provincetown outbreak. Among living Massachusetts, 74% fully immunized, yet officials said vast majority also reporting symptoms. Seven people reported hospitalized.

Something tells Israel's data going proven correct. shit brains first shot second fine. fair say certain something ate didn’t agree lol 450 vs 1400 hospitalized 118 vs 300 ICU still bit off. I'm saying possible reach start comparing January. also important note community spread increases anyone admitted hospital something unrelated covid tests positive count covid hospitalized. NJ reported vs regards vaccinated folks (for reason). instance 92 vaccinated hospitalized tested positive admitted December April. 92, 30 covid remaining unrelated reason. 92 count covid hospitalized. North Dakota one states publishes vs with. Right gets reported 11 ICU 2 covid. something keep mind reading numbers. 

If hospitals already busy course going stress hospitals covid increases believe important get full understanding what's happening. never understood every state report vs with.

I'm sure I'll voted like always posting data saying far behind simply true It’s then. ok private employers requiring it? answer yes, every scenario you’ve stated implies well. think allowed require well. I’m implying may encounter legal challenges market challenges may make difficult them. thought Sam Kendricks army, seems odd he'd squeamish vaccine.

&amp; get there's whole ""I'm world class athlete covid can't hurt I'm healthy"" even smallest amount reading would suggest might case - coin flip sports career not? want public reminded important getting vaccinated is? Seems important enough repeat awhile confirmed new data. Reminds Manaus. wouldn’t put much stock implications seropositivity this. sir, work corporate america. devil gets envious behavior. agree. need get people stop trying get extra shots instead focus helping rest world. Also think mask recommendation leading frustration. People smart CDC gives credit be. agree others criticized CDC - message science standpoint solid behavioral science failed. Maybe depend when. Like Florida might take short time however states might take longer  No, power already given away Fuck federal workers opposed this. tax payer pays can’t endanger tax payers health. Met LPN claimed people getting vaccine significantly effected menstrual cycle normal life back goddamn anti-vax shitheads taking away again. going mandate damn shots!? Mild shock

: Trump Qult idiots died tomorrow I'd dance fucking jig.  horses rear whinny like ""Young Frankenstein "". Denmark already donated nearly AZ stock. need JAIL time article simply mentions weekly surveillance testing. 

Will teachers exposed weekly? Maybe. guidance test time they’re exposed. that’s article saying. I’m high school teacher florida masks optional. also 1 5 yr old unvaccinated. start school 2 weeks, little concerned getting spreading kids. 

Isn’t pfizer 3 shot trials now? Well, another wave... Tragically, surprised me. wonder...If early 1950s epidemic Polio, instead Covid, would anyone question need vaccination--or try turn political issue? People lived terror oof catching Polio, parents told stories time, finally vaccine available, hailed miracle. instead people hiding fact they've gotten Covid vaccine family members oppose it, great newly vaccinated people declared openly loved ones said ""It love hope pray get vaccinated, too.""  already happening. Daily stories nursing sub people fed they're quitting. Hospital staff getting stretched thin places, healthcare system going collapse. also lot overlap anti-vaxxers, racists, homophobes, Christian nationalists new age hippie homeopathy types.

I don’t understand became case. people know vaccine hesitant, Facebook moms openly anti-vaccine years, none racist, homophobic, Christian naturalists. come closer “new age hippie homeopathy types” anything firmly left. Well India collapse healthcare system could people died. I’ve saying along misinformation group think. algorithms always show things agree things generate clicks. It’s healthy. firmly believe country much closer media would believe (United States) thing is, seatbelts comparable vaccinating yourself. person doesn’t wear seatbelt wreck, it’s prerogative doesn’t harm wearing mine. 

I got seatbelt got vaccinated. You’re small town, you? form: sad thing he's ridiculous, really might. ""believe"" scientific method. put faith trust it. Better? work DoD. agency went back full mask, vaccinated otherwise, Delta variant. government agencies way shortly. also think it'll make everyone sterile, 18 months everyone who's vaccinated die once.

Anti vaxxers really dumbest fucking pond scum ever live. thought get vaccinated register cdc, wrong? physician would ever agree that, patient would easily win lawsuit hospital.  hope 'do' , haha see tried say Oh good one! likely reason they're this, think sort testing may shed light frequency breakthrough cases.

It's clear vaccine effective hospitalization death, wonder ton asymptomatic positive cases among vaccinated. True. PR them, I'd pointing FACT 849 162,000,000 vaccinated people died evidence thing work. would continue tell vaccinated people live life normal, encourage businesses implement vaccine checks possible. still uncongruous messages. said vaccinated mean can't get infected, many public health policy recommendations seem based opposite. example: universities opening in-person teaching unvaccinated people. That's one example. Workplaces federal agencies moving require vaccinated work another example. requirements, odds reality still spread virus around even we're vaccinated. Negative. It’s going peak soon back normal time. made sacrifices. followed government orders, peer pressure. 

You’re afraid getting sick without addressing sick migrants open borders flights.

How scared government virus they’re dispersing sick migrants accepting visitors violently ill plane passengers?

But sure, blame Americans disagree with. you’re it, look many black Hispanic Americans scared shot. 

Look variants largely come fruition geologically is, many us don’t realize get (if get out, I’m lucky) Why? That’s question. Science doesn’t support it. Even Israel approved it’s guise “it can’t hurt”. really talk doctor. get bill needle imagine insurance won’t pay 3.  CDC political per se. heads are. filled government, hired science. Hey, get by. vulnerable people threatened support cut even made homeless get vaccinated. Others face shunning harassment. need keeping mouth shut keeps heat you, that's fine. think that's goal here. ""How in-person school without explicitly closing schools"" wear mask ?? That's whole fucking point innit recommended fully vaccinated people COVID-19-like symptoms **no known exposure** exempted routine screening testing”



What say kids packed classrooms, school hallways, school lunchrooms busses several hours day?


Seems like there's plenty exposure that's going happen whether people like not.   Thanks, trouble finding source.

That's batshit crazy. Maybe would fucking spend time money pushing people get vaccinated situation.  wanting treated respect? wanting get punched, kicked, spat on, verbally harassed? wanting treated like expendable piece meat? Yea, ok...  lot school policy curriculum decisions made elected committees local busybodies often science deniers themselves. mean everyone thinks way - ie means 'vegan'. 
 
It course good thing farming literal people - 'animals' brains. 
 
Cannot say 'humanity' everyone thinks same. 
 
Really people simply literally know better - people understand they're - they're eating. Therefore need reach everyone actually talking people figure get people - stop stuff like farming - simply right. top would even suggest forcefully stopping animal farms directly - without harming anyone process ; ie evacuating / rescuing 'farm animals'. Stopping power huge factories - rescuing people.. Though maybe like robotic remote control thing people probably want apprehend anyone trying this. like taking angle grinder semi truck full pigs stuff - rescuing people.. - yeah, make sure harm anyone rescue people - people like factory workers like make diversion make leave factory rescue trapped inside.. Stuff like that.. 
 
And mass movement thing - mass produce portable greenhouses grow algae like spirulina / chlorella give everyone account lack factory farms gone. given people freely - given everyone, even persons house - ensure people get food. portable greenhouses also built portable water distill able supply clean fresh water. even stuff like wind turbine included mechanically power water distill / stir algae setup - compact thing given everyone freely. 
 
And climate change - solved via construction large pools algae / purpose swimming pools grow algae - even use food algae like chlorella / spirulina - algae soaks CO2 thus way solve climate change - algae really fast / extremely easy set - drop algae pond grows entire pond . simple - much simpler huge machines removes CO2 - no, simple algae that. 
 
And also need help everyone change fossil fuels / carbon producing stuff renewables -- help people get wind power, wave energy power, solar - ie concept mass producing portable greenhouses freely. also stuff even fusion would helpful. 
 
\-Also virus I've found may released people purpose specifically harm others. COVID - past SARS virus. Im talking lab china - though perhaps put intentionally - im saying group people outside society care themselves. hoping people turn they're after. people im talking aliens , im talking space, they've got tech - warp drive ships - abducted many times here's image ship show real / I've made comparison drawing - seen ship person saw image posted online recognized picture - later saw drawing caught attention: www \[dot\] dropbox \[dot\] com/s/398z8ln5ybluejy/possibly%20the%20interior%20of%20the%20cylinder%20ship%20comparison \[dot\] png?raw=1

\-And I've done research - looked research David Jacobs research hypnotic regression people, looked one books basically aliens told people slow take leaving small pure stock humans / want kill everyone probably point - merely want exploit people resource much people notice. David Jacobs talked aliens literally saying 'a virus released atmosphere' 2004, ie SARS happened - saying 'will released atmosphere ' around 2017. Here’s David says that: youtu \[dot\] be/D8qibAtR1Y8?t=5322 (1:28:42). 
 
Note - I've heard David Jacobs, reading 'Walking Among Us' - talks alien human hybrids human looking designated 'hubrid'. 
 
Also btw PDF book ‘Walking Among Us’ David Jacobs contain lot information – ie talking people that’d hypnotic regression David. 

drive \[dot\] google \[dot\] com/file/d/1gUq4HB4zQkcUEt9cJU4VZG2eTMJR2cdn/view?usp=sharing thought Biden eradicated virus Independence Day ? data back up? seen 99+% hospitalizations unvaccinated. That’s carrot never power offer first place though. people really didn’t want wear masks never started wearing them. Maybe use opportunity build federal health database ?  Sure LA Times. imagine matter judging strongly immune system children responds vaccine ensuring there's overreaction (mass inflammation, etc). Nevermind making sure children develop sufficient antibodies first place make worthwhile (have studies yet?) Exactly. Imagine much higher rates would announced encouraged followers same. want VACCINES. want feel like Brad Pitt end World War Z he’s walking zombies problem. fast Delta spreads don’t expect even unvaccinated areas wave much longer. sadly much deadlier wave. Delta joke. Without proper vaccine restriction, every country could've gone India's scenario again. alabama lowest IQ, correlated figure? least, changed CDC's posture toward report things, changed. happens large population people pass high school biology chemistry. 100% this. Uncle wants keep kushy job. Surprise surprise, lying preacher Weren’t cases last week like 58k? feel like pretty intentionally misleading highlight two days rather weekly average.  that's... true all. know keep vaccines super cold temperatures? That's material super unstable. disintegrates nothing hours room temperature. 

The idea causing side effects years administration crazy. completely gone body long then. awfully red map. Yay crimson tide?  article said, think actually know stopped tracking mild breakthrough cases months ago. think good thing, knowledge breakthrough cases could discouraged on-the-fence people getting vaccine. Covidactnow.org Mississippi ahead Alabama fully vaxxed, 34.4% 34.2%. dead heat.

However, Alabama ahead Mississippi least one dose... 42.7% 39.3%. 

They might take lead. told mom got Pfizer, started crying. wish could unbrainwash her. She’ll listen crackpots medical information. *""Thank flying Delta today....""* Made appointment get 3rd pfizer shot another state. anyone else done this? so, recommendations? use insurance find already got first 2? Nah America good. sure case numbers rising tho. thought America enough vaccines entire population, no?  It’s likely, wouldn’t go far “almost certain”. You’ll see mean CDC data released tomorrow. noted CDC says study protection infection still around 75-85 percent. think people thread overwhelmed thinking perspective right now. ""STAY FUCK HOME (until personally protected).""

""(Now personally protected) FUCK THAT, IM GONNA LIVE LIFE."" fix power grid instead beating dead horse geriatric fuck  agree theory appropriate course action, it’s clearly going happen. Hence, pessimism. surely hope I’m wrong though! honestly point pissing CDC advisory panel shared research immunocompromised (2.7% us population) bumped immune response 50% third dose

University Washington’s Institute Health Metrics Evaluation, many people know covid prediction page, suggesting anyone JJ vaccine get one double dose vaccines better protection delta.

the Oxford half AZ-oxford vaccine says combining double dose pfizer improvement

ACIP working group CDC discussed today Pfizer's research come month

Since april france suggesting third dose many immunocompromised

but yeah, nobody's suggesting third dose someone asks think anti-vaxxers worst people world, I'll point article. sick selfish fucks eroding hard-won progress we've made fight pandemic, so, sickened killed tons people never suffer. People refuse get vaccinated put everyone harm's way, especially vulnerable members society. already are. guy went high school posted long rant Facebook saying secretly democrat. country get ass gear vaccination wise continue lockdown all, going major labor shortage, course they're going require it. mention short term catch covid working. strategy full support Honest question.

Weren't typically young people?

Wouldn't fall line young people get hospitalized large? Sooo... allowed state government tells risk fined? sounds un-American... odd bird. actually mask mandate one point, she'd raise ruckus people tried push back it. PSNS? “It’s flu, flu doesn’t KILL people!”

Tell you’ve coma since March 2020 accusing someone coma since March 2020. yep, he's facing primary opponent next election guy's less running ""Abbott real conservative"" expect go full r-slur next year so. already pissed base limited lockdowns mask mandates had. 

Texas quite stupid moved I'm sure point is. negatives Republican policy none supposed civil libertarian stuff like weed. Even *Oklahoma* outpaced us cannabis. Hydroxychloroquine Zinc work fine. vaccine tested 10 years. girlfriend Chinese living UK, Chinese citizens required take antibody test flying China, she’s flying back soon spoken lot fellow Chinese citizens taken antibody tests past weeks, turns vaccinated China coming UK found possess antibodies tested. 

This makes really anxious spread delta China, virtually heard immunity past infection speak possibly ineffective vaccine, could spread like wildfire. I'd feeling lot optimistic right US authorities actually said planned offer boosters, rather claiming they're needed. would nice get ahead virus rather constantly letting crisis build anything. (climate change) It’s weird omitted next/last sentence paragraph excerpt from. 

She added: “We understand people may change biology. know going persist.” sure laughing at?

Denver amazing masks. holdouts forced compliance wanted shop literally anywhere public.

Are impression “enforcement” means cops show arrest people mask? don’t know live, Denver don’t roll way. cop plans job next day.

Enforcement came public shame personal responsibility. Anti vaxxers would never admit someone else right! not, chart article confirmed hospital admissions, currently ICUs. Look chart text. I’m anti mask. started wearing mask February 2020 surgeon general said Twitter buy masks anyway knew I’d probably wear one protect myself. wore mask got vaccinated CDC issued guidance may. I’m fully vaccinated desire wear mask again, there’s always going new variants. Masks never meant permanent measure stopgap got vaccine. need learn live Encouraged. I'm vaccinated wear mask make I'm done wearing unless strictly making me. I've done part whole time. I'm provider got vaccine Christmas, everything right. I'm done bro. I'm infected give someone unvaccinated that's Tbf, even nervous. research SARS-COV early initial SARS infections (maybe even earlier that). lot people read single scientific paper it, astounding considering position take. 

They conflate information fit belief. It’s okay skeptical, that’s cornerstone science. That’s hypothesis tested yield consistent results. It’s like grade school science. 

I know people see believe it. Ironically lot people don’t see lot things believe. 

Hopefully reconcile it’s worth getting sick dying prove point. would honestly congratulate someone seeing past shame getting vaccinated changing position. Real talk…vaccines states plentiful. reason shouldn’t lie way 3rd shot booster? actually heard many people say this. key question many exposed immunized. Damn stupid people large groups really dangerous almost certainly got unvaccinated people. root problem. We’re scared, we’re angry. want lives back, people refusing get vaccine guess they’d rather get virus, making take longer needs to.  first time first something besides college football? want get MR ABBOTTS WILD RIDE Sounds like level two dictatorship sad thing pandemic shopping couldn’t curbside Alabama. work AL live GA. Georgia never enforced masks, Alabama did. able get vaccinated Alabama months friends GA. everyone went back “normal.” know, risk assessment everyday consideration foreseeable future. I’m worried outside isn’t option winter kids school.

Stay safe don’t neglect mental health. It’s really tricky balance. Yes, let idiots meet god. Darwin knew talking all. might like 300 deaths kids COVID result school year. It’s worth shutting observations also complete opposite depending thread, there’s middle ground. made giggle. never get better, messaging keep changing virus mutates again. Soon booster shot every year lose job social status. heading. exactly spaces Universal need masks. significant % world seems headed way... That's interesting question medical professional, me. Nevertheless, betting man, odds favor getting vaccination. haven’t personally back since last March sure enforcement like, currently mask requirement place still offices. understanding plans discontinue policy yet. Sweet home Alabama. would. would make others start quick jail time breaking law/forging vaccination status. said think hefty non bankruptcy elusive fine scaling earnings would also appropriate. Duck buffet turkey...:  problem sides let become partisan. I'm excusing anti-vaxxers seem like big mystery exist. know sides isle exist reactionaries rabidly oppose whatever opposites preach them. public messaging around masking often condescending confused issue got political whirlpool hot topics reasoning many people. usually stop local cvs fairly regular basis.

Lies! severe infection among unvaccinated  line obsessive thinking almost worse anti vaxxers Oh boy, they'd really hay day comparing Holocaust happened. work make rich richer cost human life. think people came monkeys devine origin. Hydroxychloroquine costs 50 cents pill. Get vaxxed, get $50, go back.*** dunno cows saw somewhere something COVID infection household cats 🐈‍⬛ dogs 🐕. lucky people (if fully vaxxed) likelihood suffer severe symptoms low.

This really celebrated. want COVID aside shopping, rarely anything indoors outside home anyway, fine risks assume living life normal vaccinated person. path forward mandate everyone vaccinated order enter indoor spaces. Target legislation businesses. violations fined. would essentially force everyone either get vaccinated remove society.

The exceptions granted someone immunocompromised legitimate medical basis vaccinated.

Yeah, blow-back, mandatory vaccinations viable path towards ending pandemic. country in? links data? worth pointing Sam Page anesthesiologist. 

And county council staffed morons thought illegal. required businesses shut down. 

Yay Missouri! wrap-around sunglasses look would complete.  I'm immunocompromised definitely getting third (pfizer). Probably, aren’t tracking that. IMHO CDC messed stopped tracking positives vaccinated people.  He's basically Jesus there... mention mask mandate? Pfizer offered send vaccination kits teams globally - access wasn’t problem except teams specific countries.   Someday AI takes over, bemused easily manipulated human race is. ...ok. Booked September! us immunocompromised family members never luxury going back normal, even brief time. 

Also good know vaccine fuck protect them. 

It's hard feel complete despair moment. Never happier live NJ. 

Unfortunately, whatever variants allowed fester states governors care reelection constituents probably make way back here.

It’s sickening. wonder goes ""it god's go better place..."" route... definitely talking myself, see someone else's view point. realize conflicting information , one study Israel shows pfizer 64% effective one UK shows 80% effectiveness. everyone fence math illiterate assume shows ""I better you"" mentality people subreddit seem  /s hope  ""It's nobody wants work anymore!"" Increasingly seeming though inverse also true?  every shitty little po-dunk town country. Why?  Congrats getting rabbit hole!!! Don’t let thread get you.

This'll blow unvaccinated communities fill hospitals, relationship case counts hospitalizations weaken considerably, we'll stop caring much. Oh know sorry sounded aggressive hoping someone could help out. Thanks answering meant though appreciate Exactly! There's plenty warning time get vaccinated became issue. Anyone ignored advice medical professionals, chose take chances without vaccine getting deserve. possible good news is, might wake call they've needed get cult they've apart past 5 years. Interesting question, one I'd like know answer well.  Cheers brother. point clearly stated goals. people getting vaccinated choice goal? either get vaccine virus, I'm going inconvenience delay inevitable people interest protecting me. Yeah sub constantly whip lash depending gets thread first Yeah. Don’t care. guarantees life. Drop pompous attitude towards person. prefaced part since February 2020 got vaccinated. enemy. presenting logical opinion viroligists agree with. Many see risk kids substantial enough restrict lives. know 400 kids died Covid America? month, year, since start pandemic. That's less average flu season (and get flu vaccinate, yet Covid without vaccine still less deadly them). Get moral high horse stoping prick someone part. yeah, scary  ""the shaw area""? mean shaw. Lets make Diamond Head CDC! 
(Cause chick cutting it) Dr. Jha tweeted data CDC memo shows actually Either American data count applies arrest. Dude, I'm like 8th shot now. know ? required test negative vaccine attend lola ? Yes, also free. got downvoted mentioning high-risk child young vaccine. It’s 1 source. It’s comprehensive review decades studies cloth masks preponderance evidence work extremely well. don’t work, it’s usually don’t fit well user wasn’t wearing properly.  Well, [I knew county would try reinstate mask least tied threshold 50 cases per day. actually following CDC guidance. Yeah furious danger nuisance society. Go get vaccine people. Like performer? I'd assume fine without mask need vaccinated. numbers standpoint, one unmasked person who's vaxxed entertaining room full people masked would seem low risk. Anyone performance would accepting certain low level risk part attending. Lol wow yeah context headline that’s pretty absurd. Let's give freedom let roll dice long pay people right thing. I'm still doubtful getting COVID big problem kids, clear mistake aggressive testing/approving vaccines young children. increased infectiousness made much harder control adults vaccinated, parents worried kids getting would much peace mind could send school vaccinated.

Right we're weird limbo can't say ""almost everyone wants vaccine get one"" parents undersandably raise hands say that's true. Here! here! infect 80 year old Mom - that's asking. That's terrible.


Anyway, here's ""Wonderwall"". Yeah also suspicions  Basically, vaccines. completely ineffective.

First, vaccine requirements workplaces, colleges, pretty much anywhere else that's willing it: restaurants, theaters, whatever. started already seems ramping up.

Next, third dose vaccine. started already Israel, hopefully US follow soon. (Frankly, we're point less honest people going start getting one anyway, would nice everyone option.)

Then, vaccines children. still farther away I'd like, coming.

The key stop catering anti-vaxxers make society function everyone else. people want get vaccine, let lose jobs keep away people. Stop downplaying booster attempt make existing vaccine look better, embrace fact many people would gladly get even vaccinated. Etc. went 20-30 cases day entire province 200 today matter weeks restrictions raised.

June 28th 24 cases. set get vaccinated found wait getting mammogram. 

The radiologist told get shot mammogram lymph nodes swell causing problematic reading mammogram correctly. said would get redone case would result additional testing rule issues dime course. 

I’ve elected wait last week August get first shot mammogram. studies coming Israel? Jw. people, probably. I've three strong immunosuppressants 18 years, rheumatologist suggested getting third, testing antibody levels 4 weeks, deciding whether 4th. There's growing body literature manage vaccines immunocompromised; cases bodies create enough antibodies drugs take shut process. how's going ""They're trying control us!"" -- person everything Fox News tells to. Employers legally allowed ask vaccinated employee you. them, still stubborn infinity beyond I’d watch series. refused go back

So go back? NYC

Confirmed cases NYC close zero. Hospitalizations close zero. 
Deaths close zero.

8 million people live NYC. 

We’ve vaccinated. one knows anyone Covid. Like one. 

It’s going hard sell mask again. CDC seems always underestimate ignorance American people. ignorant well, give fuck knowing nations cope pandemic. instead fine people getting vaccinated they’ve eligible X amount time haven’t bothered get vaccinated? saying message valid, OPSE bunch disgruntled castoffs actual governing body Professional Engineers Ontario ( OPSE tries sell insurance. engineer hate both. early data long COVID breakthrough infections. [Not here. asked doctor get shot one others said no, they're waiting CDC guidance sort booster options. sorry mental health crisis. wish best luck getting treatment. Moderna trial data E484K specific booster also compared 50 mcg booster mRNA 1278. data going forthcoming.  recent panic “vaccine ineffectiveness” coming sudden?  mean “free market” gonna save us?

IMO, makes sense want vaccinated workers: vaccines cost nothing worst COVID patients pulling 6-figure+ hospital bills.

It’s simple employers incentivizing good health practices like smoking 1 carrier w/o problems single-handedly create 1+ ICU patients.

I totally see insurance companies kicking back new ICU patients choose vaxxed. point they’re going screaming pay unnecessary costs they’re gonna jack rates us. Future medical insurance costs red surge areas gonna special type pain own.

Wow, argued benefits state/regional for-profit medical insurance providers. hate 2021, too, ya’ll. they're fine  virus real you’all Luckily closest friends vaccinated, friends well, able hang normally winter.

I'm sure restaurant situation like then... still patio time being. I'd rather vaccine pass associate proven vaccinated people. let unvaccinated people get antibodies God. I'm tired waiting catch up. 

Just adjust insurance rates based vaccine status (and medical exemptions) first address freeloader problem. means R0 least 10-12….

God help us. I’m geriatric specialist physical therapist attended online cross-country conference. Alabama therapists presented data treat acute covid long-covid patients. large amount data outcome measures patients seems common treatment diagnosis them. 

Meanwhile haven’t seen covid positive patient 2 months state 57% vaccinated. data pretty much useless literally don’t treat covid geriatrics patients vaccinated.  tell business can’t decide want customer? Vaccinated status protected class Even immediate infection vaccinated person, chain started unvaccinated people. one Covid vaccines without whole raft concomitant ""woo"" world-view?

Who said whole raft concomitant 'woo' worldview?

I blame religion. original woo-peddlers, ones taught people faith important fact. Damn sure prevented trump getting really sick Covid! Oh wait team best medical doctors world likelihood get hospitalized higher due contagious variant virus. Viral load really matters Delta increased viral loads significantly people exposed it. Hospitalizations 18-39 age group increased since rounds COVID Alpha 2020. right thing. reaction vaccine really ""getting sick"" tho. feels similar respects immune reaction (fever) infection symptoms related actual infection IDK, hear freedom coasters Disney. Free vaccine versus medical bills…man people dumb GOOD. it’s control. sooner everyone works together, sooner return normal. husband works film industry get tested 3x week don’t work. 

Something support btw. done great job Covid safety protocols feel safe husband working. could early. adopted CDC definition work (I’m HR director) determine quarantine/test didn’t. may stricter most, deal youth wanted cautious possible  agencies fall executive branch thus office POTUS direct authority issue guidance this. Civilian employees much included. Pfizer trialing hundreds people recently far they’re finding increases protection level. Haven’t heard much way side effects complications. I’m ready go get 3rd dose live immunocompromised person travel work weeks. Serious question here, please don’t think I’m attacking comment. describe example “intellectually honest hesitancy”, view true intellectually honest hesitancy would mean quality research measures research prove vaccines far safer potential COVID-19 all. Unvaccinated people preventing variants spread happening false scenario. You’ve obviously never worked manual labor job mask. It’s “minor inconvenience”, it’s miserable COVID polarized folks polarized it. 
 
This kowtowing foolishness got us already. coworker died vaccinated. friend's husband went hospital today also vaccinated 🙄 Missouri, hid mother law. found thought going drop dead minute. Still since May 🤷‍♂️ certainty that, part model discarded epidemiology decades ago.

Here's nice nuanced article subject: Projection conservatives. Name iconic duo. Right - get that. I’m specifically talking word “punishment” though. done negative? Okay meteorite could hit head moment. I'm wearing helmets time.

So yes there's *chance* American mutation ain't likely. Fuck em~ me, 2021 Ah yes, people getting bachelor's masters statistics must studying bullshit eh Fine me. say felt like shit, said **kicked ass**.

Maybe mean thing you, me.

Either way, point - point tell loved ones expect milder virus second time around, might truth. vaccinated. much drinking fox news kool aid every post FB page anti vaccine anti mask. continued live life like nothing happening. 5 weeks ICU, 4 vent improvement. 52 years old, left behind 3 daughters, youngest autistic father picture.  Really sad situation, expected risk life other's lives acting like big deal. Here's examples viruses become less dangerous time... happens there's reason believe guys want permanent health restrictions insane Walk bar...

Down corridor go.. instead going toilet swipe coaster keycard strange syringe symbol wall... 
The secret door slides side allowing access real reason here.. underground speakeasy vaccine clinic... Wtf likely still enough people take vaccine. enough people continue resist public health measures, may continue worse would otherwise. It’s still week week drop, important way look case data. this. office, sitting around 70% vaccinated. factory floor, MAYBE 30% vaccinated. Unvaccinated required wear mask, seem care. logic would never evolve deadlier virus. fitness survival, although technically alive, virus must still reproduce. Normally, killing host gives better survival changes. variant kills virulent would probably fit somewhat comes sample size. Norway ~1.5% USA's population much lower COVID transmission rates. USA nearly cases people 20 Norway people (approximately 4 million cases... hard tell exact number since age breakouts align). Reduce significant hospitalization, death, cost employer (time off, etc) letting boss control personal health decisions


Getting vaccinated downlow opposite that.  Lack education, Fox News, Russian trolls social media. I'm complaining - manageable, I'm saying equally tough, times. So, mislead people saying ""it probably easier second time get it."" That's mean. talent pool Southeast quite different.

Personally, I'm really looking forward this; either means vaccinations less competition roles. Really downside vaccinated. ignoring context Harris said. Harris worried Trump, true Trump fashion, would try find loophole authorize vaccine faster health authorities could certify or, vaccine turned differently FDA rejected it, Trump would call Democrats trying ruin try people take without certified. Something don’t see mentioned - low income people afraid miss work due vaccination side effects. Missing two three days (or more!) work, hourly savings mean food, paying electric bill. 

There lot privilege showing here.  feel like we've debate before. constitutional grounds nationwide lockdown. Further, even was, good 60% would ignore it.  can't yell fire movie theater

You able lie life saving health treatments thing never team effort anyhow. Since beginning everyone's done want regardless. go target see whole parking lot filled maskless people, knew everyone past point giving shit. even care vaccinated. expect everyone wear mask anyhow. People going Disneyland shit thats complete utter breeding ground germs  human time scale. virus particular immune effect, since become infectious developing symptoms. Could link Q&amp;A? people work refused get vaccine (or lazy to) get extra money choice. also teaches people get vaccine future better rewards

Its basically buying full price item goes sale week. teaches wait future sale. follow Dr Joseph Campbell? evidence natural immunity fades quickly? seen any. official statement CDC basically seems know good 8 months (still examined) can’t remember conspiracy theories might actually improvement. surprising. Actors' Equity incredibly strict COVID rules ever since live performances starting trickling back. parties vaccinated even then. vaccinated person 90% less viral load. Either way vaccinated people safe. agree, Since there’s national registry vaccinated people US, wouldn’t basically impossible implement? It’d get handed local governments (which can’t see going well) someone else getting something punishment you? It’s absence something didn’t even know could option time.

Where money come from? Actually, force people get vaccinated. people attend school regularly. Covid unique threat expand requirement further. Fair point. I'd still bet unvaccinated. Symptoms present little three days. going horrifying, we'd seeing big increases ready. really think due many people immunity. remember reading early pandemic articles basically saying population homogenous. Elderly people typically interact elderly young people young people. different little groups people interactions outside group. Esentially means always hit super high immunity thresholds stop spread. virus might spread rampant within one group, unable spread due heterogeneity population interactions. Thank god recall. Even though it’s likely Gavin isn’t actually afraid virus, I.e French laundry, open private schools kids, maskless camps kids. beholden whoever pulling covid mitigation strings. get end game? vaccines way  Ah, gosh, feel bad knowing this. Olympics ray hope times realize vaccines speed host country. Union negotiation Covid protocol intense productions, serious superspreader production disaster. seriously doubt Netflix would make announcement like without clearing unions first. Find another job, don’t like rules. American state 44% vaccinated. ""small vocal minority"" appears large problem worldwide, definitely stemming US. Glad translate vaccine denial massive scale like here. got $5 $5 purchase shot (Pfizer 2 jabs) Walgreens. went got mine soon group available. Where's $100 right thing?  Oh really? Thanks someone else getting something punishment you? It’s absence something didn’t even know could option time. agree it’s rewarding holdouts, hand, clearly way Delta variant gets control without vaccines. I’m “big stick” policies like banning unvaxxed restaurants etc, federal government can’t national level, states aren’t going own. options there? Hope none collapse like actors whatnot heart issues could go pharmacy right work weekend get shot 5 minutes free. don’t buy really reason people aren’t getting it. reported separately, would add massive 0.5% daily cases! never fully open? get end game  People wear masks due mask mandates. can’t get grocery store without mask on, people wear masks.

What said people get MILD case flu can’t long term effects, rare. common Covid. same, much everyone wants pretend are. issue it. mean help convince get shot fair enough I'm it. I'm convinced convince many. hard core anti vaxxers believe Bill Gates putting microchip us still get never will. hope guess majority unvaccinated hardcore anti vaxxers lazy get shot think need it. guess it'll convince hey free money really make majority unvaccinated? disagree. move continue stamping covid population gets fully vaccinated months. Australia great shape. Well tried become indoctrinated quite dumb enough talking help that. vaccinated putting family risk self-isolate. Remember, we're vaccinated mean cannot get sick. Protection wanes. Delta variant getting past J&amp;J especially well. people got vaccination what? get extremely tiresome soon enough They're people feel need scream harass people abortion clinics. one thing want petition laws themselves, take time day bother people they're effect them...it's surprise exists. flu absolutely long term effects damage. People die it, think people lasting damage it? I'm saying happens much covid let's pretend flu joke. Delta changed game. It’s seeming like need 3rd booster. It’s pulling teeth get people take 2 vaccines though, never mind 3. 

At time though 3rd shot cuts transmission delta further, would need less people vaccinated. quite true. federal employee say ""my sincerely held religious belief..."" exempt vaccine mandate. Thet may exempt routine testing. scrutiny letters religious leaders required. saw Altnegalvin hospital capacity. Awful. wonder friend North seem understand fueled anti vaxx beliefs? Funny mention Facebook considering it’s #1 source misinformation anti-vaxers. Except know going sale - fact willing pay $150 item got item next week $100 change life all. Good getting cheaper, wanted cost $150. remember poking. college evolved several times Im scared look going raise deductibles CHF patient visits McDonald’s diabetic who’s a1c still high didn’t eat well enough? Yup never going end Excellent! know Delta/Darwin variant points toward single dose mRNA shots pretty low efficacy. really need shots see meaningful protection. imagine pharma company coming vaccine would also vaccinate around you? Obviously work here. Look I'm saying celebrate early like Joe Biden declaring victory Covid 3 weeks ago. Maybe it’s stupid idea going vacation pandemic get you’re saying. kicked ass days, felt like shit days, felt like garbage couple weeks (brain fog). Definitely difference “kicked ass” “felt like shit”. olympics people good already infections started arrived. It’s natural delta variant spread. Trump - even fucked handling covid snd hundreds thousands deaths hands- STILL second highest votes history country. 

I wish right, aren’t. cult strong. disgusting comment! am... part I'd like live now. go removing vaccine body get re-vaccinated lool. God damn got nothing. seriousness gets people taking shot guess I'm it. Wow, that's shocking news. would guessed? capacity better. It’s global virus. Need 15 billion vaccines produced said done.  figures. hoping cities done something. peep North Texas. choice tested indication severity. ratio merely infected may quite good. allowed pro-vax anti-mask world?  Moco? People wore masks pretty much always 2-3 weeks ago, noticed lightening bit. week back almost everyone seems. numbers actually alarming... unvaccinated. That’s correct. vaccinated people become infected, get sick spread virus, though lesser degree unvaccinated will. sucks, ignoring possibility areas high case numbers going make virus magically disappear. I'm thinking covid endemic (which likely is) want booster 1-2 years road ensure longer term immune response continue respond covid. possible ""forget"" long periods time.

In short term though, many people need booster. healthy young adults risk remarkably low. already vaccines. funny unvax ppl dont care get shot?😂 Comes government needed balanced budget years. comes 1s 0s government computer. Yea pretty damn stupid. point people wanted get vaccinated have, dont arent. COVID stay, like flu, going changing every year, like flu. never going end, people need accept it, also stop letting fear mongering control lives. part deal youre human, better accept live life like always did. stage need let nature take course, otherwise neverending cycle lockdowns, masks, social distancing, countless things last year half. Im vaccinated, more. variants, it. Um, die? vaccine doesn’t work? people within reasonable time frame. lost mine week, totally back normal two weeks later. loss taste definitely annoying, honestly fine loss smell. lot gross smells well nice ones! People that, fits narrative. Like guy actually vaccinated🤣🤣🤣 Mrs. Doubtfire??? cloth mask protects people, you. never MIL's cooking :) Takeaway- someone wants access it. someone doesn’t want take barred society form. problem though states vaccination passport like countries exactly would one prove got vaccinated vaccine card Kind disappointed, hoping going say yes post clip Maury security called separate pregnant strippers fighting. 3 days lowest end scale. Seeing uptick 9 days later makes sense. 3rd world country parents live right would kill pfizer vaccine, metaphorically. really really bad atm Beer helmet. Thank wisdom *A special moment 2021 America*: Governor Florida mocking vaccination efforts state overrun virus, thinks help presidential campaign. haha alright bud. Mask, test, trace, quarantine, repeat! argument immune responses triggered vaccines don’t lessen time? Bahahaha!

Even didn’t decline (and guess you’re superhero?) it’s less effective variants strains predominant USA now. 

Contextually, makes difference. You’re idiot wants argue. 
. know I’m late asking this, know vaccine safe tested less year? 

Fully vaccinated myself, wondering   strange hill trying die on. No, make sense. unlikely happen, I'm exactly going taking precautions like say chance happen naive.

Which never said. fact, yes there's chance American mutation ain't likely. Fabulous! Really shows importance vaccines. hope get eligible Americans take shot asap Maybe someone correct I'm wrong, believe would expressed 1,700% likely. FDA approved... definitely get vaccine stick government?"" maybe Dorothy hallucinated Oz dying, brain trying make sense chaos trauma. Like movie [redacted] starring [redacted] Robbins ... Good point. one made assumption on. science deniers powerful positions consequences seems.

I see chicken-egg problem here. Well done give Tricky Dick Fun Bucks, brought great taste Charleston Chew! Funny can't help decide others bodies screaming choice, it?

It's almost like announced world ever control. aunt told I'm gonna drop dead two years got shot Particularly Reddit\* might ready. think people lives aren’t good enough. aren’t suicidal, feel like go. Religious exemptions subject scrutiny. Require letter religious leader explaining theologically person cannot get vaccine.

Anything make difficult people harm public health keep jobs still think raffle tickets sporting events. 5 people sign group 5 fully vaccinated. one wins get tickets game. one shot winning, would multiple chances. Plus vaccinating groups people.


There's universities 100k+ stadiums 7-8 home games year. states multiple teams could pack stadiums. there's professional teams.


Then year stadiums full capacity 100% vaccinated fans. Let full cost concessions go stadiums teams recoup costs ticket sales. So: change. No, 17 \* x True.

But percent drop slowing. curious see continues hit plateau. someone stubborn get own. It’s individual; it’s people sphere, people spheres, spread to. don’t see sane person saying “meh know, imma hang give $50 get shot” think strictly draw people truly don’t give fuck getting vaccinated. imagine lot homeless people skirted far jump looking post history London yet complaining American FDA approving something?????

If knew keep charade... Shit. How’s brain fog now? need start sending film crews live stream them. 

Excuse sir/maam, would like give public statement much hospital stay costs thoughts vaccines? course anti mask thing insane. people afraid wearing mask. idiot nuts. ... what? They'll vote mega republican? Uhm, no, ""what asking for"". slide says masking non-pharmaceutical intervention they've included probability model. 

A slides later, ""Next steps CDC Prevention"", first says ""Universal masking source control prevention"" ""Reconsider community mitigation strategies"", way like NPIs table. understanding way math applied may incorrect, R10 75% vaccine efficacy, vaccinated breakthroughs potentially contagious non-vaccinated infections, original vaccines alone longer enough get R0 1 even 100% vaccinated communities. Herd immunity longer possible even theoretically, also mentioned slides growing number repeat infections occurring six months previous infection.

Third dose guidance probably going change soon response this, masks stop-gap again. don’t know maybe think I’m anti vax something. I’m speaking mind trying learn though Bay Area, thing. Portland.  opposed unvaccinated people likely pass on… Absolutely get tested. new guidance yes. think one talking lockdowns...


what kind business run anyway? lots black people. whatever reason they're united Republicans one. think many people point don’t like life anymore whole point minds able things again. also think many people took vaccine without true understanding worked new variants could form change, understand they’re contagious non-vaccinated people, time around kids danger getting sick (see information children’s hospitals Houston Florida), vaccine didn’t result freedom - don’t think it’s reasonable many people wondering “risked” taking vaccine now. Many people took thinking it’s new they’ll able “go back normal” woods societal punishment unvaccinated would limited unvaccinated. 

We’re back square one, we’re square negative one younger people (and kids) getting hospitalized kids can’t vaccinated parents viral load unvaccinated people delta variant infectious chicken pocks causes serious disease. gets kid sick higher numbers. 

So live area high amount unvaccinated people transmit variant someone twelve even you’re vaccinated. think school going work. tell don’t live poor area, lol. $100 move lot people many things. sure version Bama there. way. Really. I'm surprised. Anyways... separate issues. Yeah, need everything help get countries vaccinated, also need make sure we're adequately vaccinated US. every eligible adult US vaccinated, I'm sure hearing Delta variant US. propose people meantime slow spread mandating vaccine? Creating memorable experience rest life lot easier two weeks live. many leaps logic here. know republicans vaccinated democrats think it’s poison. You’re smart think read think get worker’s compensation get covid work. money thing right Lol, already cheap. dangerous virus, would actually open lot land resolved however.  read MI’s cases rising FYI  That's coming, Israel time wait cases doubling every 7-10 days. 60+ getting third dose starting Sunday.  Folks deny theory evolution eliminated it. Damn. Got mine January baffled many people still far in. both? meantime, mask. unvaccinated getting done tomorrow. Handy rule thumb 7 percent growth doubling every ten days. think anyone advocating government hold people force vaccinated. idea government passes increasingly tough restrictions unvaccinated people increase vaccination rates they're high enough prevent community spread. course always hold-outs, goal never get 100%.

For instance, government passed laws anyone needed either vaccinated wear N95 mask indoors levied severe fines businesses enforcing restrictions, many people would choose get vaccinated avoid hassle. that's effective, government get aggressive laws.

Finally, mischaracterizing many anti-vaxxers. majority simply misinformed rather mentally ill. Incidentally, one espousing fear paranoia people scared paranoid. Maybe step away social media while. Many conservatives well-meaning simply understand facts. see many people reddit would benefit going talking real people rather consuming hours tailored echo chamber media preferred subreddits. Spreadnecks. like every Democrat said “inheriting Obama’s economy”. story played sides always forget said damn thing. dumb.  realized ""finna"" keyboard typo gonna exists. Thanks that. terribly designed study. think compare deer serum pandemic assays? Perhaps didnt them, otherwise cannot rule cross-reactive antibodies common cold coronavirae. mean COME I’m Los Angeles made county wide one could download Apple wallet QR code! It’s awesome. I’m actually impressed got together lol party small government regulation. government big brother. 

/s One dose 30-35% efficacy rate Delta. Wikipedia wrong Probably sibling spreading Depends believe, CDC “outbreak investigations” CNN didn’t link too. Neither seems great. point alarmed safe. Sf giving people weed vaccinate we're vaccinated symptoms, get tested?

No fever, shortness breath fatigue. fatigue similar got 2nd dose. made one work’s Facebook page thank suggestion. pissed decision too. It’s amazing people downvote fact Wow, could’ve caused this? be? /s absolutely fucking idea might happen 5 10 years now. 

This thought since started. Novel virus ought told us chapter three long, unread story unfold lives. First chapter emergence surges, second vaccine its' deployment, third COVID Strikes Back. 

Who knows fourth chapter be?  Good. fucking American Pediatrics Association says send back masks. CDC. I'd like 1s 0s plz Great...even deer COVID. think people really misinterpreting whole ""breakthrough infections"" thing. (I think lot people kinds people huge fans vaccines first place.) looks like breakthrough infections pretty common, hospitalizations deaths people breakthrough infections very, rare, that's key point lot people missing. vaccines may slow spread much we'd hoped, basically reduce virus common cold. makes even important people get vaccinated, can't rely bunch people get vaccinated protect you. still want know circumstances breakthrough infections used viral load comparisons. I'm assuming coming symptomatic people? would seem difficult collect information asymptomatic individuals. slide Dr. Jha references indicates CDC n=19 cases surveillance, though information Massachusetts indicates n=65 unvaccinated. really want know showing symptoms tested. big difference asymptomatic people walking around viral loads symptomatic people. find interesting state, high vaccination rate low case incidence, report outbreaks considering shortage shore towns robust public health infrastructure find country. 

Also, ""more transmissible Ebola"" really say much. Ebola transmissible, thank god. please forgive putting much faith transmissibility estimates Spanish Flu given values based inference modeling. Moreover, pretty wide error bars around transmissibility estimate Delta variant. 

Also interest slides: estimating vaccines 75 - 85% efficacy preventing (I'm assuming defined) infection. Masking assumed 40 60% efficacious preventing spread 20 30% efficacious protecting infection. that's bad news unvaccinated kids Delta really severe transmissible amongst school aged children. British surge seems suggest case, least terms transmissibility. makes slow walk vaccine approval 12 set somewhat unconscionable. least, contradiction raises questions me. 

Last, graphs reporting modeling four colors, three colors defined. Maybe Dr. Iha information appears slide I'm misreading them, eyes graphs seem uninterpretable without knowing fourth color means. least, I'm sure Washington Post expects laypeople get slides. really show anything new, clearly meant public consumption. mean, that's fine, long get shots. That's positive. patients, yes , slowly months one feels back baseline yet. see maybe 6-8 patients regularly, others intermittently, huge sample. one thing don’t see anyone mentioning vaccine still isn’t available everyone globally. Delta variant didn’t originate US, dominant strain.

We debate needs done curb virus US, point I’m sure much gain world vaccinated. 

As vaccinated adult I’m concerned moment. concerned fall winter going like toddler newborn. dies High Republican area correspondingly low vaccination rate high infection rate? Nobody could predicted this! would love hear average unvaccinated rube think PCR stands Delta: free real estate assuming nightmare scenario anti-body dependent enhancement Pfizer. I'm skeptical thesis also think given limited data can't rule out, either.

There zero evidence support hypothesis. vaccines continue highly protective severe disease. ADE play, severe disease rates would go up, down. high viral load means neutralizing antibodies prevent infection takes time body ramp secondary responses triggered immunological memory. 

Please spread misinformation. COVID vaccines causing ADE. **zero** evidence that. first one get vaccinated something?? Welp, we'll seeing another headline months. guy legs, hes 80% risk dying covid 🤦‍♂️ Yes, vaccinated people actually pass virus somebody else, although rare. much supported Trump, support mixed messages mask wearing schoolyard bullying Biden wearing masks. 

The Republican party become used supporting messages ""that opposite Democrats."" good messages, virtuous messages, messages best society. majority people get it. stalled little 50%. Alabama decided doubling every 10 days good enough. Underrated comment. case would good news. Unless mean life insurance, health insurance usually doesn’t charge smokers. can, smokers actually cheaper health insurance companies die faster. wish easy... Texas full dumb, racist, pieces shit. vote again.... I'm holding breath, honest. make ride restraints optional wearing masks, too. Good way maintain reputation fly-over state. Translation: enough people vaccinated, need hype delta variant people get vaxxed. Scotland good weather summer? changed enough warrant broad mandates? lot virologists think so. Hi Demortus, thanks asking.
 Changed healthier lifestyle, diet, exercise regimen it’s appeared help bit I’ll strange bouts depression depersonalization(?); blankly stare computer wall get emotional. family doesn’t recognize personality, concerns them. I’ve continued seeing psychiatrist unfortunately there’s concrete remedy covid since it’s relatively new.
My case quite severe, hindsight went hospital fever high several days…
Sry pity party lol, thanks asking roll dice whether next mutation beneficial (spreads better, less harmful) dooms us (evades vaccines, kills more)? predictive framework gives kind guidance way probably go?  IT.

After seeing countries astronomically comical overcharge smaller things, can't imagine would charge service. must raking money expense peoples lives.

Just get vaccinated rolled back mask advisories soon.

I think that's really fair

There much pressure politically ease restrictions ""reward"" people gotten vaccinated

Unfortunately we're dumb children, guess Guess Redditor lives GA/Ala border? Sigh. live Ontario testing pretty restricted still seeing around 1% positivity. Though Alberta saying quarantine test positive anymore symptomatic. vaccinated too. careful positivity rate better mask up. ""Kaputnik"" major impact life ruining social interactions leading debilitating depression. Lowest Education Rate... Highest Positive Cases...

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder there's link somewhere that... Italy you? I'm States trying decide whether go not. anybody really surprised they're surprised Kentucky Mississippi. We'll never there. Looking Delta variant (and honestly, general lack sequencing make sure we're getting something worse Delta popping up), we'd need 90% vaccinated.

There's certain segment population, who, whatever political conspiracy reasons, NEVER get vaccinated, even gave loads money, banned things, etc. We're hitting 90%, let alone 80%.

I've covid (at least likely twice) severe reaction vaccine (spiked 104* fever one night only) I'd take vaccine reaction every day getting covid. covid fairly mild still feel like absolute shit six full weeks some. bright side. high transmissibility Delta variant probably related selective pressure presented vaccines &amp; natural immunity prior infection. kids remain unvaccinated, may end uniquely susceptible supercharged variant develops among adults, could help alleviate future climate change Alabama *not* , then? says seven people hospitalized. needs made explicitly clear following: (1) vaccination status, (2) ages, (3) known health conditions prior. 

Transparency goes long way helping us understand what's going on. media done particularly good job last 1.5 years. details helpful report something like this. What’s point already virus? Check comment history. got ER earlier today. Pfizer shots got unvaccinated cousin. couldn’t breathe given monoclonal antibody infusion oxygen hours still dropping Military members already get non FDA approved vaccinations requirement. But.. theoretically get antibodies, several times that's herd immunity, right? vaccine requirements workplaces, colleges, pretty much anywhere else that's willing it: restaurants, theaters, whatever. started already seems ramping up.

To data indicates opposite. Now, transmission happening regardless vaccinated status, thus measures become useless. course action, individual level, get vaccinated lower prob getting severely sick.

&amp;#x200B;

Even end article said it:

&amp;#x200B;

“I think central issue vaccinated people probably involved substantial extent transmission delta,” Jeffrey Shaman, Columbia University epidemiologist, wrote email reviewing CDC slides. “In sense, vaccination personal protection — protecting oneself severe disease. Herd immunity relevant seeing plenty evidence repeat breakthrough infections.” 

&amp;#x200B;

It clearly personal choice whether get vax, whether low effect people. Israel Pfizer though, also many breakthrough infections too. Given virulent variant is, think people simply spreading much easier. heard well doctor work with… don’t know it’s fatal tho. 

I think it’s spreading easily ppl getting infected. ICUs filling tho I’m sure.   Yes US UK vaccination rates far apart. agree apples apples comparison everyone freaking fuck trying put data since everyone panicking people Provincetown right permanent residents. Correct I'm wrong. I'd love wrong.
'The vaccine means rushed' - Every News outlet gave time frame 3 years vaccine start pandemic. Fauci said this, vaccine ready now. 

'It resources thrown it...etc' - expensive equal effective.

'Millions people got could studied faster. ' - know vaccines studied, know true. imagine lab works antibodies there's 50,000 recovered cases vs. 5,000,000 recovered cases know changes happens lab. lab capacity change? know, think either. think talking ass point. Correct me, please.

FDA approved emergency use. US removes emergency mandate, approval goes too. long term effects I'm worried about.

16-18 months covid data, death rate hundredth percent, numbers likely even better due asymptomatic cases. 12 months vaccine data 80 year olds. 4 months data people 30. Maybe less. Idk exactly age range approved take vac

I'm waiting 12 16 months younger range ideallu. I'm waiting 6 months school year starts minimum college students forced take attend classes. see.

Is fair risk assessment young healthy person? tell why? I'm obvious skeptical biased, think points hold merit. I'm listening, I'm wrong, show me. Gotta hold til around end year.
Hopefully kids vaccinated then.
Even get covid, they’ll likely fine. They’ll become thing everywhere deaths/hospitals get bad enough. month they’ve hit capacity earliest. Yeah boy, wsMFp already owns moniker  shot takes 5 minutes get. 
COVID killed aunt (a healthy 54 year old). think three days side effects (which unusual) still better that. Ah cares anyway rules going away back soon 3.7-5.0 number assuming fully vaccinated mitigating factors. saw post something like WSJ February. It’s lie quell fear. full R.0 factors likely say, 10-12.  Drive plus cruises true. Joke? true all. 80% 88% less likely even sick first place long they're hanging vaccinated people.

There still risk grocery store work etc. cares listen lol

That rate obesity *still* refusing vaccine? They’re basically begging die. ROLL TIDE LOL No, unvaccinated far likely spread it. Vaccinated individuals get spread it, they’re 39% less likely get virus.

That’s huge difference.

And get virus, they’re less likely severe infection. die.

The spread due unvaccinated people. Amazingly enough, infection gets control, gets easier easier spread even protection. US medical industry definitely brought themselves. medical debt largest cause personal bankruptcy, stories people receiving six seven-figure medical bills media every day, people understandably gun-shy going anywhere near doctor. lifetime savings wiped one medical event.

Not saying would happen covid vaccination, course, think overall perception unexpected unfair bills well-entrenched US population. know, *god bid* would listen science Fuckin plague rats. work last election. Even less get done 2022. COVID literally going save USA. elements it, effects brain look longer term. need Edward Snowden within CDC leak EVERYTHING. send everything wikileaks let chips fall may. Everyone's emails every classified report. 

I'm getting tired constant whipsawing. One week something big deal, next gonna get everyone. 

Just tell us brutal truth stop trying make best everything. Hi bud yes you’ve linked before. It’s info I’m looking for. Nothing new.  Trust me; people chosen get vaccinated selfishly refused wear mask far past whatever logic try speak them. I’m tired pissing wind. absolutely hate saying whenever chance either optimistic pessimistic take regards pandemic, pessimistic take seems correct take. betting man, would bet pessimistic take. 

Again, like saying I'm saying literally zero reasons optimistic (because are). Anecdotally, friends saying psychedelics helped recover sense smell taste. Mushrooms particular. Also helped deeper breathing.

Might long shot 8 months, thought would suggest case want explore option. sucks. Hopefully sense taste get back normal time. lot things smell like eggs me, terribly pleasant, especially since means bad things good things smell similar. seen doctor long-term symptoms? supposed things done try bring back old sense taste. Worth shot, least. Tobacco use question every healthcare application I’ve ever filled out. lie, feeling doctors tell pretty much right away it’ll go file. Def could wrong tho. Smokers def aren’t covert think are, whole vape thing idea Disney mandate guests vaccinated.

Let DeSantis sue them.

Then finally settled court. It'll gamble whether get sensible judge might way nix anti-vaccine passport law. Frick much conservative parties summed idea domineering enablers - exactly want do, free whatever want. dumb comment. kill-rate countries compared night day difference, statistical offices much higher repute. 

you cannot kill virus, prevent vast majority people getting repeating cycle. 
while strain evolution inevitable, absolutely evitable population endure shock suffering again, impose preventative measures soon alarms go off, like new zealand done repeatedly. 

what feel like fetch new propaganda words failed epidemiological strategy starts saying ""we can't possibly save everyone even try saving majority"". philosophy repeatedly questions whether economy comes health, disregard absolute fact economy health. mindless repetition valuing freedom movement even basic freedom fearing plague every moment step outside house. 

it generation's economists' abject failure, greatest act corruption, point hard evidence prevention cheaper, faster prolonged efficacy whatever new bullshit half-brained remedy comes around every 2 months. 
in america currently turning towards re-masking, convincing face nappies absolutely stop cycle. whereas places like spain, strong mask culture enough, idiot rulers turning back curfews half-assed restrictions. 

meanwhile new zealand, situation dramatic (which living bloody 5th time) never allowed escalate far. every time shut down, predictably reopened 4-8 weeks later. incidence declined, certainty surety people go back living without face nappies bullshit ""new normality"" restrictions hygiene distance. cut infection cycle travel restrictions make near impossible untraceable imports virus cause uncontrollable outbreaks. 

none value you. concerned rhetoric. winning battle someone going grain, s**** you. interest actually fixing problem. humbly recognise exist already better approaches countries save lives keep businesses operational; abject failure contrast. 

there none this, truth hard numbers matter, change channel find pundit speaks nice words shows rebuscado pie charts make easy rulers valuing life highly believe Would 600k+ people killed gunfights? Exactly!! went glued tv waiting gov address give advise. 

That total joke ended sooo quick.. president standing front us— like yesterday, corona task force team addressing country (well country least) it’s ridiculous.  personally believe long covid permanent? Yes I’m aware catching COVID getting already getting fully vaxxed crazy. Gets worried dad almost died fully vaccinated 😅 like arguing :D Springsteen Broadway requiring attendees vaccinated, imagine shows open Federal onsite contractors well.  There's plenty long haulers last year prior vaccine's availability. seeing those? binaxnow test kits bought $20. buy 2 packs get free shipping. amazon stock now. Delta spreads vaxxed people literally can’t keep freaking mild symptoms right?

Mild COVID typically includes lost smell/taste. According researcher heard NPR recently, means affecting brain. want virus messes brain. use KN95s bigger longer trips, like grocery shopping, cloth ones smaller, less risky trips. Best worlds. runs counter ""let's blame Bubba"" meme seems everywhere.

The situation obviously bit nuanced. saying quarantine test positive anymore symptomatic.

What fucking fuck?!  might help enact mandates going convince folks want Kids can't get shot. Vaccinated parents likely ""rare"" contract able give unvaccinated children. Covid might come lifelong effects, even mild infections. might significant you. CDC gets right facts normal comes wrong conclusion. Saying need learn live virus. No. try learn live virus past months look it’s gotten us. vaccines now. know masks work. know lockdowns work know frequent testing works. Combine 4 things extremely aggressively look elongate covid short timeframe. Thank you, helpful! Vaccine make 100% immune, massively helps chances infected. 
 
Delta variant makes even less so. said, MASSIVELY benefits outcome prediction severe COVID, hospitalization, death. 
 
The people vaccinated less chance breakthrough cases happen, becomes math game point. Keep convincing friends family vaccinate yet. Good, better without people anyway. Reducing rate severe illness hospitalization. original purpose. lol, what? Restrictions already going away. live Bay.

It’s absolutely due unvaccinated. great pastor reveals utterly insane since comeback next week sure everyone else utterly insane. Trump helped create culture denialism whole pandemic general. ""It's big deal!"" tell people something big deal, going take precautions, much less get something like vaccine. 

Sure Trump anti-vax far coronavirus vaccines go acolytes taken pandemic denialism step further. vaccines lowered chance dying around 20 times. think safely say Alabama pulled away Mississippi worst state US. best friend (fully vaccinated Pfizer) literally got covid hanging 3 fully vaccinated people movie night. turns one covid, symptomatic, another felt sick couple days later suggested get tested came back positive, first guy asymptomatic caught work.

Delta seriously changing game, still good preventing hospitalization/death, much likely catch even you’re fully vaccinated. 

Crazy thing supposed go movie night cancelled last minute. I’ll probably downvoted reads like antivaxx me. reads lot like “These people died wearing seatbelts.” it’s objectively true people still even though they’re wore seatbelt, exactly solution here? people wear seatbelts they’re useless? people live constant fear transportation safety features 100%? 

I remember article couple days ago [long COVID healthcare workers like 3% symptoms six weeks 19% symptoms all. So, healthcare workers got vaccinated, 0.057% COVID symptoms six weeks. people presumably exposed COVID *a lot* people outside healthcare setting.

Vaccines work 0.057% hardly reason deny go back full lockdown continue living rock fear getting sick. thinking thing. Spread rumor US achieves 90% vaccination Trump reinstated President. Make legal sounding nonsense they'll buy it. risk long covid equal though unvaccinated? Same. Hang there. add long term issues result ventilator: longer ventilator damage body. Same. I’ve late reading info subreddit. That's antisocial personality disorder  reinstating mask mandates (with real reason why) pushing (false) narrative breakthrough infections common, public officials taking away motivations unvaccinated people get vaxxed. One friends got third dose going Walmart lying. ""database"" good. That’s don’t get tho, it’s literally “weld doors shut” “lick doorknobs”

What somewhere middle? Vaccines temporary masks.

Not much fun type furiously screen…. MODERATE APPROACH WORKS I'm sure many people still bought N95 / KF94 type masks. stocked shit supply chain stabilized. also really helpful wildfire smoke descended east coast. shut like hell last year little brother this... Great! /s see good thing Missouri leaving called anti-maskers back then.  According Bloomberg today passed 4 Billion worldwide doses!

-an atheist  90% [Characteristics vaccinated hospitalized Israeli total 152 patients included, accounting half hospitalized fully vaccinated patients Israel. Poor outcome noted 38 patients mortality rate reached 22% (34/152). Notably, cohort characterized high rate co-morbidities predisposing severe COVID-19, including hypertension (108; 71%), **diabetes (73; 48%)**, congestive heart failure (41; 27%), chronic kidney lung diseases (37; 24% each), dementia (29; 19%) **cancer (36; 24%)**, **only six (4%) co-morbidities**. **Sixty (40%) patients immunocompromised**. 

[COVID-19 infection solid organ transplant recipients SARS-CoV-2 [of seven COVID-positive immuno-compromised] patients required hospitalization

[Anecdotal, - Marc Boom, president CEO Houston Methodist, said hospital, 90% patients COVID-19 unvaccinated. **The small percentage vaccinated patients** end hospitalized, said, ""**have underlying significant health risks — like cancer, like [organ] transplants** — probably prevented mounting full immune response vaccine. 


tl;dr: ADE happening, would see increase healthy people unexpectedly severe cases. contrary, see persistent sickest people weakest immune systems becoming vulnerable, massive overweighting immuno-compromised. Israeli study, 40% patients identified immuno-compromised compared 3% hospitalizations US pre-vaccine. I'd wait til jump train fully. study seen circulating India referenced rejected publication back review. Also believe even used humans look it, lab based data. need lot data say that. cruel thing do. Even vaccine dangerous young people covid, gives fuck? I'll take tiny tiny risk means spreading disease kills vulnerable people. 
 
The previous generation literally built country even willing take incompressibly tiny risk them. long mods remove post mentions politics? :/ Yeah feel that, idea sub loves block arstechnica.  96,318 deaths Americans 50-64 years old.

16% Covid deaths.



At 61 years old Phil Valentine closer 64 year old upper end range 50.


And get vaccinated. No. Hang man, know worst come worst, we're likely contract severe illness we're vaccinated.

Chances are, barber clear got vaccine. High vaccination rate county also help. Looking comment history validates said. Yikes! Cousins blame..... Right? Abbott needs get together &amp; become stand-up guy great state Texas needs I’m Alabama too. I’ve fully vaccinated since March. It’s sad. can’t convince 60% people work protect young, unvaccinated children home. say “don’t want experimented on.” Provide source.  That's scary. Imagine malignant narcissist also understands deeply people feel manipulate better. terrible news. dumbass unvaccinated people get covid even dumber. thought crosses mind often well... good episode. Always look forward probably right boosters. see people taking covid-19 seriously enough unless becomes deadly disabling. start killing 10% children, example, would probably lock hard. They're still 70% fully vaccinated.

That's still lot unvaccinated people spreading it.

Then figure got 12-20% chance actually getting covid vaccinated doses (data seems place)

So anywhere 42 50 percent population still get sick  Murphy probably implement mandate doesn’t “have” to. Sadly, governors free make bad decisions. Governor let hospitals overran last winter let many die. didn’t even implement mask mandate state restrictions. done something didn’t. better things reply 3 different times get mad stupid example New York handling virus well gets btfo? Governor encouraging vaccines, statement that, “I’m do,” horse shit. could push vaccine mask mandate. No, weld doors shut. UK made way (it appears) delta wave.

They peaked around 47,000 cases deaths look like top soon around 75.

That's .14-.16% CFR KNOWN cases. IFR certainly lower. 

I suspect cases certainly get worse better spread cases deaths certainly largely better.  article making case vaccine mandates though. key new data point vaccinated people infect people readily unvaccinated people . (preliminary results that) , anti-vaxxers good case vaccine mandates vaccine primarily personal protection. Exactly. laugh, could see “essential oils” style treatment include this.

I also know least one person got Covid early on, specifically little limit exposure that, theory helped keep immune system “pumping”. ^^^^fully heartedly agree drinkin' beer, dirt bikin' sad like we're dealing toddlers need bribed what's right. ""Now go poopoos potty sweetie get lollipop!"" Baltimore's population heavily Black, yes? understand Black Americans reluctant get vaccinated. can't buy Tuskegee study. must reasons.  Thanks! Muppet are… Like dad used say.... ""boy, gonna learn today!"" It’s weird fucked strategy take it’s political parties base killing mess may well affect elections line. That's level response expected, thanks disappointing. think everyone get vax I’ve NYC 9 months I’ve indoors fair share throughout. masked much possible, I’m fully vaxd since May 16th, I’ve lucky covid yet. don’t anything (covid) risky, live life responsibly. Saying level fear. entire population??? Given new mask advisories CDC's new advisories, believe farfetched local governments may institute capacity restrictions concert venues, restaurants bars again. wear seat belt? Keep eyes open driving? Wash hands poop? Store food refrigerator? cause (a space container) become full almost full. vaccine get when? Moderna/Pfizer get doses?  Next up, control flights federal level. Mandate want get plane. We'd see vaccinations skyrocket that. That's ticket out. needs done immediately getting full FDA approval.

I've calling along dad since works travel industry! takes one airline require proof vaccination negative test departure rest follow suit.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes. Let's fill inhalers w/ virus. Lol. opposite “most” “some”. small percentage (“some”) large number (people vaxxed) still significant number. Damn it, saw post yesterday hoped you’d get better news. I’m terribly sorry loss. Don’t think takes rocket scientist figure Huntsville complete outlier compared state. education correct aero industry thank that. Thats awful thing say canada. delta variant US Virus (in trump speak?) part third Pfizer shot based folks Pfizer looking 23 people. Nothing published reviewed. hang hat all. crazy fast headline spreads huge data, involved tests 23 people, yet peer-reviewed clear boosted antibody levels actually correlate better protection, extra protection even needed. US Centers Disease Control Prevention says current vaccines protect people well common variants. Thinking vaccines useless losing perspective. data fantastic anything don’t get wrong, states multiple times vaccines remain effective. speak losing perspective talking people thread think vaccine nothing prevent infection etc. Let patience know billions angry she/he gets sympathy far know Biden reversed this. could hopefully wrong pretty good Come north then, friend! Ah. boomer. original comment makes sense saw chance worse Mississippi something took it!

No longer second worst,first worst!!   man Christ. caring flock church larger one humanity. far closer devil, endangering everyone ignorance playing politics decrying same. decidedly unchristian. must cases amongst vaccinated high number vaccinated then? feel like looking data wrong. That's think empath. people empathize others. think that's big deal shocker. like way comment makes seem like ""empaths"" narcissists feel empathy. think author intended read times understand meaning. Shutting discussion agree always good thing. don’t understand is..what actually offering people? Like doesn’t want enforce vaccines masks, then..what? Carrying pretend go back normal isn’t goal.

I’m sure breaking point anymore…well, Florida becomes wasteland. Good, companies make pain employees customers unvaccinated people give go get shots. We’ve tried carrots, it’s time sticks. primary news source reddit truly fucked. Washington state 4.4%. Work highly populated tourist area. Thought would another 2-3 weeks upped PPE. started two days ago. husband shingles 25 years ago patch scar tissue damaged nerve ending across half middle back. sucked him, hasn’t gotten again. didn’t know was, didn’t seek medical help late stop damage. Ask doctor. Great! ask ID? Thanks posting back. Arkansas? We’re garbage too! Sure -- either mandate vaccines, let rip Delta w/o restrictions. I'd prefer option 1 2 get done too. We're yet, exactly need mandates. understand masks could necessary meantime, frustrating stop there. situation enough emergency force people distance, enough emergency force vaccination. 

Masks temporary measure, okay, live that. Lockdowns restrictions New normality rest lives, certainly furious since ended ICU.

Is furious knowing might exposed immunocompromised children cannot get vaccine yet?  goal never get covid (at least infection) fanciful never getting flu cold rest life. virus stay. Good. immortal words demographics tend refuse vaccine existence COVID-19 United States, ""fuck feelings"". Probably important note actual growth happening, too. local mom-and-pop stores family-owned restaurants making money.  race bottom Sure, I'm saying need right Gee seems FloridaMam yet completely unhelpful. u proof that? Right know many breakthrough infections occuring among vaccinated.

But even so, whole world vaccinated, vaccinated spread virus. many bizarre heart issues patients come in. weird. atrial fibrillation rapid ventricular rhythm patients Brady cardia . Idk it’s linked it’s coincidence still get Delta variant vaccine lol didn’t. told everyone drink bleach, sit sun, masks lame Imagine caring little health citizens also ignorant. It’s mind boggling dangerously stupid governors Texas, Florida, Arizona are. Black status means AdventHealth defer non-emergency surgeries hospitals. hospital-based outpatient procedures deferred well, outpatient surgery sites also conduct time sensitive urgent procedures. Looks like 210 cases day Manhattan right? That's nothing. [I hereby declare state emergency, code Yep. Got md kicked practice telling staff need vaccine telling patients insane.

Felt good see malpractice insurance carrier yank policy. treatment plans? agree, think hyper-coagulation/ microvascular injury must something it? honestly don’t think it’s rare. Patients admit issues probe. It’s embarrassing 30, 40, 50 feel like dementia. 

Post-Covid patients require long visit this, long haul issues terrible sometimes feel little vague patient. don’t feel like themselves. 

I’m sure providers time do? don’t see patient every 20 minutes, get bit time I’m new. empath? people empathy, seems “empaths” trying say they’re special think feel deeply everyone else? hospital setting means bomb threat know never thought like that. Covid actually blue wave everyone keeps talking lol Pfizer pushing third shot rather delta specific booster ready right now, need CDC approve injections . . . quick search shows 3rd dose current vaccine recommending. spreadnecks

wow. vaccine mask mandates allowed, even private businesses thought supposed part point side fence, instead law basically allows racial profiling can't wait get state unfortunately while. think so. next variant one that? sure see ending. Ah, unfortunately right. It’s really nuanced. It’s there’s attitude towards people won’t get vaccinated immoral stupid. That’s conducive understanding all. bubba thing caricature made represent people aren’t them, says far people promote caricature people it’s supposed represent. 

If refuse listen people opposed you, may surprised point find actually believed quite different thought believed. know it’s unpopular compare covid flu, there’s reason experts always it… they’re similar. Think influenza pandemic 100 years ago. It’s similar period time that’s almost completely erased history books… countless people (don’t know exact number) died, family included. Whenever similar strain (H1N1) came around, extremely lethal hadn’t exposed… heard many young kids dying “swine flu”. fact is, flu scary, right dismiss virus “just” flu many people did, number one thing learned past year half absolutely get vaccinated reasons covid.

The majority people comparing covid flu dismissing it. Rich assholes always get richer suffering others. Yes Yup! Shit hitting fan work. Today least 3 intubations floor sent icu. tonight I’m sure!!! patient leave didn’t need oxygen required 8 liters….. Another patient barely press call light weak intubated whole week can’t even press button . are. sympathy them. Let Darwinism take hold continue refuse. fact people family members die covid still refuse get vaccinated beyond abhorrent. shit, sherlock.  Jerry Mander says, “Hello!” [Black? That's worst colour basically going back Lead gasoline, wonder crime spike related. sure brain wasn’t affected? would explain stupid decisions. live stream minorities getting shot stage white people outside begging it. 

Alabama 100% vaxxed next Monday. think 70s Chuck Norris film. maybe Steven Segal. 80s. ask daily. (The lockdown sucked implemented poorly previous administration gave money big businesses turn pocketed money. fair people lost incomes shenanigans necessary get numbers bit. Unfortunately essential (a term pisses end) forced risk health, physical mental, every day corporate big wigs got work home making huge profits bonuses.) wearing masks hard part? put mask every day worked 8 hours, huge sacrifice able open. Check Bay County, Fully Vaccinated **Percent 34.44**

Didn't PM also personally get mix match? hear feel same. cling good stuff, like fact vaccines saved 280,000 lives counting, knows many thousands saved masking social distancing. We’ve saved lives sitting couch though feels like forever, won’t be. Maybe get little worse gets better. healthcare system take it, de need slow spread. anti-vaxxers get sick hugged vaccinated friend, im sorry, them.

If healthcare system can't take it, yes, masks. temporary measure mask mandates enforced, priority. Quite literally dream.

Have fun cities begin burn gotta vote oh dear.

(sorry) believe also number 1 Christians 48th education. give us days. DeSantis: Nothing see here, move along. Thankyou. control, yes...move along.


And babbling Abbott much better. guess state one states opted allowing higher premiums smokers

So interesting studies costs smokers calculated $72,700 among men $94,700 among women, lifetime costs among nonsmokers calculated $83,400 $111,000, respectively. facing surcharges, smokers facing medium high surcharges significantly reduced insurance coverage (-4.3 -11.6 percentage points), significant differences smoking government increase health insurance coverage decrease smoking obviously. Wow, whole time thought finna came ""fi"" one key away ""go"" ""gonna"" keyboard. thought origin pwned Lmao! republican politicians talking heads got vaccine meanwhile Wow, words ""personal protection."" might Americans. amount urging vaccination sake children immuno-compromised people convinced anti-vaxxers. getting vaccination ""rushed"" ""side-effects."" guess new messaging really much come think it, maybe see members immediate community get suffer they'll change minds. take breathe, still lot unpack sources extremely important. breakthrough infections Israel healthcare system small number statistically insignificant. know breakthrough infections happen course data needs published. 

The data vaccinated people spreading virus extremely important. far I've seen poor references would wait see actual data this. 

We get it. 2015  Know know killed Bambi's Moma. oof that's harsh surprising seldom comes up. way he's photographed never know wheelchair almost never frame. honestly can't tell that's sensitive disability ableist hiding it.  spreadnecks going force us back lockdown suspicious reasons (the blood clots such). Come think it, actually talked whether would willing take one, since conversations involved expressing concern female relatives taking (because blood clots common women- they're still incredibly rare, course, whatever). Maybe I'll try broaching subject, I'm pretty sure stuff like blood clots ensure he's comfortable one either. Worth shot, though. Uh-oh... Define code black really worry that. Anyone who's currently alive *now* still somehow remains 20 years going way pressing demands attention, point. everyone got vaccine would see less community spread. second wave coming hospitals strained screwed again. thought well, parents unfortunately vaccine convincingly told opinion complete 180 fully approved soon. people weird shit believe in. UK high vaccination rates compared US. 100% people vaccinated 100% percent cases hospital would vaccinated people. highly vaccinated countries understand situation look percentage population 40% 60% come from, percentage itself, makes sense. Heck, even look UK, cases exploded old highs thanks delta variant, hospitalizations deaths barely increased. may ask? 70% UK’s population least one shot, compared 50% US, concentrated liberal areas country. words GET FUCKING SHOT YOULL OK working it, guys get Ford Shits kinda hard got ""muh freedoms"" crowd complete tantrum think wearing mask comparable victim Holocaust.  Plus let governor fight private business publicly, one biggest employers that. Good idea chances getting myocarditis vaccine MUCH less getting Covid itself. right thing. might work states, doubt Florida/Alabama ever that. mainstream media focused destroying wikikeaks rather fact Hillary deleted emails  Love one. true. try persuade can, there’s anything else besides trying convince people (I idea what), would also cool. mean outside boosters new variants, nothing, good protection reddit hive mind downvoting you. 


Reinfection happens rare, breakthrough infections also uncommon.  


Guy talking 'fuckbags' getting vaccinated chances mutations new variants. Maybe missed news thing becoming endemic, reaching herd immunity via vaccination stop mutating pipe dream I'm glad educated people stopped believing going possible now. yet FDA wants hold review data vaccines kids risk seen 12-17 year olds. get it. understand wanting sure vaccines safe kids dragging feet. Thank really enjoy job even tho it’s rough What. worst back water, uneducated state, majority republican leadership republican voters. covid cases? could be?? probably get it. got mine like February March. Idk man don’t think it’s simple. best friend got covid movie night 3 fully vaccinated people, one got work completely asymptotic night movie turns got work.

One felt sick soon decided get tested, came back positive.

My cousins family doesn’t go all, fully vaccinated, daughter went hang friends (fully vaccinated Moderna), dad pretty-existing conditions wasn’t taking chance otherwise), caught within days family felt sick, tested positive covid.

Take look r/covid19positive , never saw single breakthrough post couple weeks ago, there’s post, post, post, post fully vaccinated people getting covid passing onto fully vaccinated people. rhetorical question. specifcally called slides, found here. Good points. points still doesn’t mean vaccine “ineffective”, mean need careful. Actually tell government forcing **not** get vaccinated jump hoops get vaccinated. Nonsense. One party made choice masks vaccine wrong. finding dead. Family Yeah, feel like science massively evolved since morning posted.

Delta transmissible common cold; infectious chicken pox! Causing far worse disease initial strains.

Until get shots arms gonna get ugly again, cover COVID vaccine needles, pointed outwards.  Shocker. Well, let's face it, numbers people throwing tantrums going keep getting lower..... Ban unvaccinated people games tailgating guarantee vaccination rate goes 80% Basically personality cult leaders. Russian **linked** operator

Thats get you. shot get? Widespread Pan(dem)ic Completely agree. Felt awful reading 74% vaccinated Provincetown cluster. I’ve trying stay optimistic convince still unvaccinated vaccine right choice. know used counter argument. :( current data Israel. Cases doubling every 7-10 days 60+ getting third doses starting Sunday.

Edit: realized Post, read NY Times push phone. Well anyway, context matters:

Yes, vaccinated person spreads virus easily unvaccinated... **if get sick first place.** Much article quote new data suggest vaccinated people spreading virus contributing numbers — although probably far lesser degree unvaccinated.

And literally end article, last two C.D.C.’s figures show vaccines highly effective preventing serious illness, hospitalization death vaccinated people, experts Delta troubling variant already knew was,” said John Moore, virologist Weill Cornell Medicine New York. “But sky isn’t falling vaccination still protects strongly worse outcomes.”

tldr: Get vaccinated. Yup We’re gonna need 70% unfortunately. Probably 80-85%. must incest Thanks That's everyone country. Currently UK, adults vaccinated. want hold until? keep waiting see loved ones they're eventually going die old age.

All parties vaccinated safe get foreseeable future. say quite safe way, despite doomsday messaging media. I'm dozen people know real life vaccinated still caught COVID

There’s difference “doesn’t prevent transmission” “has absolutely effect transmission all.” Vaccines almost certainly make much less *likely* catch disease, even it’s still possible. all. wondering conservative media went countries right blaming US.

""One slides states higher risk among older age groups hospitalization death relative younger people, regardless vaccination status. Another estimates 35,000 symptomatic infections per week among 162 million vaccinated Americans.""

This I'm concerned right now. Like, Mom Dad (aged 64 71 respectively) safe thing they're vaccinated (Moderna Pfizer) no? understand. CDC simultaneously saying ""vaccinated people still safe"" ""elderly people higher risk death, regardless vaccination"", it??? There's also data coming Israel saying vaccines lose effectiveness least elderly vs Delta, everyone 60+ get booster, apparently that's high priority here? We're gonna ""wait see"", maybe give boosters old folks start dying again?? understand I'm kinda freaking right now, ngl. someone could convince I'm worrying nothing, I'd greatly appreciate it, I'm getting concerned time goes this. live Florida.

That's bullshit number exactly slide talking about: Matthew Seeger, risk communication expert Wayne State University Detroit, said lack communication breakthrough infections proved problematic. public health officials emphasized great efficacy vaccines, realization aren’t perfect may feel like betrayal. 
 
That stat touting bastardization numbers make point meaningless. sales pitch get people vaccinated. mean, good, encourage people get vaccinated. number misleading causing people uninformed vaccine.  
 
The vaccine around ~6 months. compared many Americans got COVID first 6 months last year, ~7million. could easily said ""*oh hur der 2.1% Americans got COVID, seems pretty rare! open er up!*"" 
 
You compare entire population baseline. compare exposure. vaccine trials did. compared ~20,000 vaccinated people ~20,000 unvaccinated people similar demographic area. time frame, population, exposure. That's got 95%. That's number meaning.

So, ""what hypothesis?"" point view, they're trying show (at point) result 60% effectiveness Delta true, whereas people (England, Canada) show around 80% effectiveness Delta.

When go re-run numbers, correcting mistake denominator (they used country-wide vaccination rates rather higher local ones, even though Delta outbreak localized), longer show 60% effectiveness. effectiveness looks much like everyone else's studies, around 80%.

This actually would scientific skepticism work: outlier -- Israeli results -- particularly since initially show math, treated outlier, effort put showing results problematic. softer ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"": outlier outlier? Turns out, outlier wrong denominator. that's accounted for, results particularly remarkable. 🤦‍♀️ thought Florida god’s waiting room.  keep seeing Pfizer’s isn’t greatest time Israel right now

Some least-protected areas, like counties southern Missouri northern Arkansas, currently facing large outbreaks. Taney County, Mo., 28 percent residents fully vaccinated, average number daily reported cases higher ever, hospitals area seeing surge Covid-19 patients.

In areas country, vaccination rates high 70 80 percent. researchers say likely counties reached herd immunity — point enough people immune virus unlikely spread within community. Delta variant contagious, threshold higher before.

That means much country still susceptible kind rapid spread put stress hospitals lead worse outcomes patients. best protection every community, experts say, continue vaccinate many people possible.

“Small increases vaccination coverage make significant difference terms cutting number cases” overall, said Bruce Y. Lee, professor City University New York leads PHICOR research effort. “If get higher terms immunity, slow virus.”

The PHICOR estimates, combine vaccination rates estimates immunity prior infection, show 98 percent U.S. residents live counties less 70 percent population immune. 82 percent people live counties less 60 percent immunity.

To arrive risk level county, PHICOR researchers adjusted national estimates Covid underreporting approximate true number cases county. totals 128 million cases nationally — nearly four times number reported cases.

The researchers combined case estimates vaccination rates county adjusted figures account Delta’s ability evade natural defenses. result estimate total number people county immunity virus, estimate still susceptible infection.

PHICOR one several research groups attempting model trajectory pandemic virus might spread next. Jeffrey Shaman, epidemiologist Columbia University, leads research group produced estimates found fewer vulnerable people PHICOR overall.

Dr. Shaman’s model showed broadly similar regional patterns, though measures vulnerability varied county different methodology team used. Overall, agreed country remains vulnerable Delta variant, though noted areas risk large outbreak others.

“The areas higher susceptible pools grow faster rate,” Dr. Shaman said. “You’ll see greater explosion cases, peak higher number, overall number people infected larger.”

Forecasts compiled C.D.C. average project number new cases deaths continue rise coming weeks Delta dominant form virus United States. may mean return preventative measures like mask wearing vaccinated people areas, given uncertainty breakthrough infections.

“In communities starting see real concerning surges hospitalizations cases, even vaccinated people need part slow transmission community whole,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, epidemiologist University Texas Austin director U.T. Covid-19 Modeling Consortium.

There positive signs: majority adults 65 vaccinated counties, offering strong protection worst outcomes one at-risk groups. despite recent rise cases, number new Covid deaths remained low.

But pace vaccination slowed 80 percent since peak April, half people United States live counties people remain unvaccinated.

Although breakthrough infections rare, experts say vaccinated people living around large unvaccinated populations may susceptible infections likely encounter virus event outbreak.

“Every time go out, there’s chance might encounter someone vaccinated possibly infected virus,” Dr. Meyers said. “The people vaccinated, less likely becomes.”

The disparate levels defense across country pose challenge controlling pandemic. “If virus still locally circulating certain areas, raises probability another variant emerging,” Dr. Lee said. Masks never supposed 100% shields virus.

For would need hazmat suit corresponding facilities.
It’s probabilities, getting average infection rates down. true original strain Covid, may true anymore. elderly longer filling hospitals--now younger healthier people. Absolutely

Bulgaria strange place. vaccinations slowly went 15% (at least one dose), stagnated 2 weeks (according Google). US already ordering boosters Since 506 days since pandemic started would imagine soon point movie finds true love snaps Groundhogday goes life. Neither, arithmetic.

It's simple fact everyone vaccinated, existing strains can't survive long enough evolve; one vaccinated, vaccine evasion practical value, thus selected for.

60% full vaccination (which roughly position UK now) crossover point, enough immunologically naive hosts virus reproduce, many immune escape unimportant trait terms selection.

As UK track vaccinate around 70-75% population/90% adults, period elevated risk pass soon. Every fucking time overcorrect, 2 years real time proof slow, ineffective, bureaucracy be.

During event 5 vaccinated 5 unvaccinated get infected. look cases, half infections vaccinated people. 
However, actual probability infection 5 10 (i.e. 50%) unvaccinated, 5 90 (i.e. 5.5%) vaccinated people.

In way back square one contagious (and apparently harmful?) virus - also much population vaccinated it. variant powerful, defenses stronger too. math estimated Rt Delta vaccine efficacy, come Rt somewhere around 1. 
 
The original Wuhan strain estimated Rt 3-4. 
 
So obviously 1 less 3-4, vaccine help reduce chance severe symptoms including death ~half. instead 1% mortality rate we're dealing ~0.5% mortality rate.

[The Israeli study outlier used wrong denominator initial run initially used country-wide vaccination rate calculation effectiveness. went back realized initial outbreak localized, population highly vaccinated. corrected local vaccination rates, vaccine effectiveness number ballpark England Canada studies, somewhere 80s instead 60% range.

original strain thought around 2.5 reference. understand back-and-forth nature comments, inherit tribalism present topic; let clear. get vaccinated. productive action take help pandemic. 
 
But need realistic data suggesting vaccinated people. got virus that's got Rt like 8, vaccinated thereby reducing effective transmission 75-85% (somewhere around there, let's even 80% now) that's 8 - 80% = 1.6. That's Rt 1.6 among vaccinated people. 
 
This means vaccinated people dealing virus contagious enough spread even among vaccinated people. Obviously Rt ~1.6 explain explosive growth we're seeing lately. That's Rt ~8 unvaccinated population. 
 
But we're mixed together 200,000 cases day projected, vaccinated people perpetuate outbreak albeit slower growth curve. 
 
What's making people think vaccines useless hearing they're practically immune never going die, finding entire clusters vaccinated friends got party one night. CDC needs honest infectivity means vaccinated people. 
  
The good news 1.6 among people living generally normal lifestyle easily fixable light-handed social distancing (probably). Indoor mask mandates *might* get &lt;1 own. worst case we'll reduced capacities such. *ought* get vaccinated people mess.  
 
Unless another variant Rt 8 comes around.. Assuming Delta overblown regarding symptoms vaccinated people

I seen anything suggesting symptoms worse Delta vaccinated people. CDC changed stance based evidence people vaccinated symptoms potentially transmit virus. say symptoms severe.

Both UK Canadian studies showed mild symptoms upwards 80% less likely fully vaccinated person, severe symptoms remain extremely rare. Spoken like someone without kids. Kids already massively behind education now, socialization. Enough enough. getting kicked out...? give room voice. take seriously pretend stance isn’t completely wrong insane. need reject people pander them.

As far concerned point - throwaways. blatant disregard others lives disqualifies participating society. always get downvoted post point view, goes: elephant room somehow never gets addressed health insurance. large percentage unvaccinated poor people - many Black Hispanic - many good health insurance coverage. Even though vaccine free, adverse reaction complication requires emergency hospital visit could cause financial ruin low income worker even insurance. People underpaid, shitty service jobs inadequate non-existent healthcare, expected risk lives pandemic less trusting system, including medical system, good reason. Europe full Americans. know giving young 12. like said consider getting kids vaccinated didn’t know enough potential side effects vaccine. kids 12 getting sick, badly, makes believe vaccine better option possible side effects virus itself.

Obviously it’s recommended won’t get vaccine, job parent always what’s best interest them. think lot people don’t want vax kids tend also vaccine question don’t want first place. it’s political, yes, would judgments that. turn vaccinations military? walked us assembly line giving us shots questions asked lol. eldercare workers need test, elderly homes need test, wait maybe need test sent millions useless tests....maybe it. never stopped masking started last February. need incompetent organization telling best. Read studies act accordingly. time touted 90% effective even catching it, words like ""virtually impossible"" used came hospitalization death. words mattered. many places trending vaccine roll started. May June unclear many people would choose get vaccinated heard Delta threat much world. think depends live, many places like month everyone told safe vaccinated. what. goddamn summer people getting vaccinated left right. really expect people stay locked home forever? 

If vaccinated, quite possible whole shitshow end this. positive PCR test. Thats vaccines for. protect serious illness death. used test vaccines soliders? They’re colonies. full access vaccine.  even need working outside home anybody. either pick mine work chemist, get testing sites order line. need book pcr isolate results symptoms. week daughter needed pcr booked test 2, tested 3 result 7 next morning. 10 day isolation. Wow. two months pandemic, hooooo boy. Guess need better equity measures white affluent people city. can’t shame them. need outreach. need learn communicate educate group. This. epilepsy another chronic health condition. wanted wait make sure vaccine safer conditions. Masked everywhere stayed home. finally felt like safe called multiple pharmacies yesterday trying get first vaccine it. awful time afterwards conditions still well today, it’s better covid. Weird people know got favorite part viruses helped shape human DNA now. good luck DNA pure anti-vaxxers.  mean experience loss taste smell common cold too. one symptoms among fully vaccinated would thrilled. started Russian cleaners follow protocols….

Fantastic. shall count number people surprised revelation:  told that. verified know variants could contagious chicken pox vaccinated spread virus much unvaccinated anyone sees what’s going says “I’ll sit one out” either dumb dillhole

Hm idk, country recommend vaccinating healthy children 18. go recommendation get understand people would hesitant. I've worried ever since found they're tracking break-through cases - hospitalizations deaths. 


As researcher, cannot fathom want data break-through cases lead hospitalizations. thing think want give people sense security.  


So, they're turning blind eye data, sake politics, economy, whatever, seem like stretch imagine they're juking stats hospitalizations too.  100% would blame medical staff refuse treat anti vaxxers come sick. Take everyone else, car accidents, heart attacks, strokes, allergic reactions, elective surgeries. someone comes refused vaccine sick, send home!

These id!ots trust doctors tell get vaccinated, *do* trust doctors treat illness?? little convenient taste. # THEYRE TAKING JABS never stopped wearing mask way virus behaved year ago showed going happen. Vaccines going effective mutates, knew happened since day 1. Everyone vaccinated help. arguing that. virus mutates, vaccines need adjust keep mutations. kind boggles mind new information surprise anyone. always path time. horrifying outcome, time face reality here. updates vaccines &lt; 12 years old? I've seen articles talking expanding studies, I'm guessing means September target going happen. chance end year? feel safe airplanes inside venues unmasked, probably unvaccinated patrons. Planes pretty good ventilation. They're also pretty serious everyone wearing masks plane, less airports overwhelming majority folks wearing terminals. one said that. Send army forcefully vaccinate people

/s maybe news effective Johnson + Johnson vaccine delta?  truth is, vaccination decision driven age. 65+ seem able see clearly reasons getting jab, even tell everyone done so. Wearing mask whole different situation, plainly obvious, may invoke peer pressure situations. know this, I've happen me.  I'm doctor recommend anyone specific vaccine yes mRNA vaccines seems efficient. 

I think sure, passed year since first shot issues (exception trials different goals, i.e. stop death hospitalization) 

From Corona virus (Yes reason called SARS-COVID-19) know immune system creating memory cells last long time. People SARS 20 years ago still memory cells. almost guarantee U-turn 2 weeks time. Surprisingly, killing voters go well even state like Texas. Ya, unvaccinated neighbor eats healthy immune system protect family. Preparing downvotes saying this, messaging last year we, individual level, solely responsible someone three (or four five) steps away ladder gets covid horrendous effect thought processes risk analysis. it'll take get thought process well.

Do feel like need conscious. However, every variable situation (vaccinated, negative tests, outdoors, six feet apart, etc) point towards passing covid three ladder steps away. university actually damn shame r1 research big medical school. can't enforce anything due desantis. mom works healthcare mentally done. seems like smart model wished places used. Vaccination rate probably single best indictator whether safe reopen not. like ending “a new hope” it’s “empire strikes back “ formality, focus manufacturing side - made handled, etc. P Town thing aren’t saying clearly bear week. high contact (in many ways) time houses get rented slammed guys. P Town thing aren’t saying bear week. high contact (in many ways) time houses get rented slammed guys. woke feel sick stomach. got bad feeling month schools open, kids going get slammed. local government mandated mask policy got challenged overturned 5-2.

(Depending area's transmission) real stick fear. un-vaccinated afraid consequences, great desire. different study evidence brain matter loss scans. Shrinking China habit ""saving face"" covering bad news.

But, tbh, look country planet reacted fast enough, even pandemic officially declared. wonder much China ""cover up"", much simple fact new virus nobody knows anything about. It’s race baiting garbage well football coaches highest paid public employees states. KN95 masks I'll use. kind dumb trust me, getting tested regularly LEAST WASTEFUL thing I've seen working production. Really??? February March April last year telling us threat COVID average American remained low continued spread throughout US. told us masks don’t work? Roll tide! Probably help media CDC lost collective minds every variant Delta. Can't surprised cry wolf one many times, people stop paying attention. Yep. Walked Kroger. Walked 20 mins later (because wait 15 minutes post injection reaction). survey conducted sample 2,074 U.S. 1,119 NYC parents March April 2021 



This study seems outdated. expect high IQ south?

There reason think intranasal therapies might provide protection viruses.

From Journal Allergy Infectious Diseases:

""...We propose intranasal administration antiviral virucidal therapies decrease viral activity nasal pathway, thus preventing disease transmission, expedite recovery mild-moderate COVID-19 patients, decrease severity symptoms, reduce hospitalizations mortality. clinical research care kids start getting sick? Thanks guys!

-Missouri Pretty much got rid Facebook time reach number early 2022 may totally different advice based variants learned longer-term efficacy vaccines. may well need booster shots then, Israel already starting 60+ year olds. 80% adults still well anything like herd immunity. think risky make predictions far out. go get 3rd shot own? Boom! Good luck safe flight home. No, would issuing statement true.  Even bizarre world lied like they'd immediately called doctors, scientists, health agencies. ""muh pre-existing conditions!!"" it, horrible ain't 😔 Oh sure. entire last 12 years (since early Obama's admin) building giant psy ops American public.

It absolutely worked! Alas, returned normal 0.8 gay state again. Turns needed wank. suburbanites? would factor in? No, rate protection slow spread stop it. important set correct expectations. Great shape. Can’t leave house. Military street. LOL Anti-social people.

Introversion equal anti-socialness.

I say introvert struggled immensely last year isolated social groups. Remember when, months ago, response sub mention restrictions even remotely positive ""but Florida""? Well, here's ""what Florida"". Lol trying think something obvious saying... figured nah. obvious enough make point. It’s already spread worldwide. mean?  “Ding Jie, health official Nanjing, told reporters cases linked cleaners worked flight Russia arrived city 10 July.” 

Russian flight, cleaners. misspoke. question? Per Fauci tenant virology virus continues spread continues mutate. know virus transmitted among everyone regardless vaccination status. potential difference vaccinated unvaccinated severity disease. regardless vaccination status people keep milking society vaccinated continue spread virus. people milling transmissions, masking increased transmission. Increased transmission leads increased rate mutations leads development virulent, deadly variant evades vaccine protection. 
So imho it’s question vaccinated not, ship sailed. question surgical vs n95 mask regional vs total lockdown. wanna say, it’s mind blowing figures stats exist, people still question legitimacy vaccine. almost like job advise entire populations underestimate amount introverts world.   Looks like south ready blow map, well. AL plenty company. data come bad loss learning due virtual learning never stopped wearing masks. work public daughter young get vaccine yet. I've worn damn things 8-10 hours day year half I'm used them. I'll keep wearing bear minimum daughter vaccinated even depend bad around here. Thank you. read slideshow kind shocked how…not new info was? came like April 2020 levels panic again, plans hazmat suits, grocery wiping. Bizarro land.    No.  work's still going done, agree mask requirement.

Don't worry work aspect, that's priority. Hate government agencies think reduce panic hiding spike averaged value. reduces trust agency person making decision.  passed vaccine incentive last bill. Instead $100, make $1000. $200 first shot $800 second shot Yep... nobody really cares.

""We can't vaccine passports! let hundreds thousands people die needlessly deal inconvenience scanning fucking QR code enter building.""

I know people going wake realize way thing ends fucking people forced get vaccinated. need make life unbearably inconvenient finally fucking get jab. People like reason pandemic won’t end. nearly 90% effective serious illness. make personal risk choices. mask stay home forever. case haven’t seen shit going around: favorite post said vaccines linked 460000 different side effects. Let’s think minute. Yeah, given prevalent Delta collared couple months ago, I'm willing guess hesitant parents changed minds.

Best comment board, always follow money worry, vaccines shall go waste.

Let’s see results compare them. get away refusing go back office? I'm required go back starting 9.7 many coworkers vaxxed. I'm afraid refuse, even tho Ive proven productive working home, fired non-compliance horse shit .  Maybe someone needs make social media bot everyone died covid posts week ""Yep, still dead covid"". subs reaction slideshow exact reason never meant public see. people quoting possibilities presented stated fact posters here. 

We people completely ignoring slideshow specially says vaccines remain highly effective need get shots arms. is, was, always goal. Nothing changed. 

The new talking point vaccinated people transmit much unvaccinated. That’s slide said. said MAY able it’s based preliminary data subject change. People completely ignoring fact order vaccinated person transmit covid, catch first brings back point above, vaccines still highly effective. Profit People name new Alabama variant? went school still see people's Snapchats. Covid ignored gets.

I've always said Alabama would blow map ever strayed far federal government days I'm suprised taking long something. H1N1 came around given choice whether get vaccine already caught recovered it. told...you getting shot. it. Europol...? People naturally afraid go back worst case. It’s human response trauma. based numbers, probably (some of) vaccinated people wearing masks point. Went grocery store yesterday maybe 1/5th people wearing masks.   Thank sharing that. good information helps put things perspective. frustrating reality. someone (like many you) obsessed knowing going bs “well informed uncle Kevin” became family’s reliable source whether Easter person not. Yes, tests work known variants.

It may allergies old-fashioned cold. Drink plenty fluids get rest take Benedryl it. :) son's allergies awful year, skips day Claritin, appears sick.  Oh Alabama! One racist states country. fun y’all! much get test. much thinking already home since work retail Texas, like whole country.

I'm going assume comment byproduct fear vaccine, allow point never vaccine side effects 60 days administered. fact going side effects normally observe within first 30 days. goes vaccines including ones use now.

So worry, someone fine 30 days getting shot, small chance something happen point, past 60 days clear. outside timeframe they'll also fine 3 years time, 10 years, 50 years whatever interval 60 days would like guess at. here! thought lucky 1 shot now, much. clearly insane. fattest state country years Mississippi overtook us. Don’t worry. We’ll back. It’s guys body twisted broken it’s soul is.! Doesn’t Alabama PhD’s per-capita Huntsville? That's lot stupid ppl  Yeah, I’m starting see older people family, it’ll twenty years don’t something  lot column lot column B. None makes sense anymore. couple months ago Fauci urges us “put mask aside.” CDC horrible this; beyond emotional whiplash, it’s legitimately becoming difficult know they’re recommending since oscillate guidance frequently. 

Side note, take responsibility unvaccinated adults point. That’s decision, live potential consequences. wearing mask outside seems unlikely “protect” people already downplay significance Covid.

We're already [80,000+ cases **right now**, 560,000 week. 'forecast' nonsense? Move Texas. Seriously.

""If Gov. Abbott really cares health safety Texas students, educators communities, give local school officials health experts option requiring masks schools,"" Ovidia Molina, president teachers union, said statement."" 

Interesting Gov. Abbott claims side personal freedom restricts personal freedom public schools. Kinda confusing honest.  don’t want covid period? anything that? always, fuck Gov Abbott. Man great articles…do work hospital? so, would see 80% people ICU right people vaccinated COVID-19 (not articles). would see man vent right thought getting vaccine would prevent this…you would see family trying everything keep dad alive confusion read articles, dad life support. one story many families around me. tell them?

It literally means virus proportionally split among population. Vaccinated people didn’t fare better unvaccinated scenario. Remember people thought covid made worldwide make trump look bad?

Brutal yes, help help others. going able end pandemic 6 months unless Wuhan style military lock across entire globe. Even then, guaranteed success. China still seeing non-zero covid cases per day even though travelers required tested well quarantine 14 days. 

That's feasible world live in. halt global trade however long takes eradicate pandemic globally? 

Only stopping international travel still allow domestic spread. Unless disease virulant kills host quickly like MERS, spread able contained. 

Merely holding powder keg long term solution. 

Italian city Ferrara able keep Bubonic plague bay patrolling borders well sending sending suspected infected persons hospital located outside city.

The common reason say ""I regret getting (super effective) vax"" sort anti-vaxx astorturfing bullshit. months seeing posts, reflex discount/downvote posts many people. Meanwhile schools skip enforcement $ virtual programs. household teacher, covid nurse 2 kids 8. outrageous hope Abbott’s grandchildren die slow, horrible deaths. Let die. delta variant already burned UK without overwhelming deaths hospitalizations. Cases dropping sharply US isn’t far behind UK recently peaked. expect see results. vaccine get? husband fully vaccinated (Pfizer me, Moderna him). coworker COVID once, twice, THREE TIMES. exposed last weekend memorial event dad. got tested week fine, thankfully. really wish coworker would get damn shot. Well, mean wrong impossible.

But generally agree, people thread necessary epidemiological qualifications fully interpret implications behind data, understand internalize confounding variables. 

From able ascertain qualified experts data concerning, nothing hysterical about. data shows vaccines still good job preventing severe illness hospitalization, likely cause us re-evaluate vaccine impacts transmission NPIs may necessary vaxx'd people reduce likelihood contract COVID become vectors spread it. really? genuine question.

I'll fine, basically common cold point.


""It might mutate again"" acceptable justification for: mask mandates, social distancing mandates, capacity restrictions, undue restrictions rights Americans. trying optimistic, showing even moderate range estimate, can't stop spreading. People's options exposed vaccination they're far less likely get severely ill, exposed naive immune system risk hospitalization death. I'm sorry poor taste like get rational people build wall around Texas something? one thinks long term lockdown ends borders open, Covid (despite large portion population) going field day Australia NZ? people exposed entire time there’s little natural immunity. explain poor vaccination rates among urban black Latino communities? know strain would spread differently always restrictions place? original strain may spread quickly placed restrictions march 2020. Matter fact look new york numbers well US hotspots could see high death count went hardly testing determine many infections were. Comparing delta strain unfair human behavior changed drastically past months. far Trumps ass tell way sun rises.

""Limited government"" preventing government entities getting way individual's choice. order prevents government entity getting way individual's choice. we're getting started (Delta speaking) heading fall. 

And lockdowns round DeSantis pushing masks. 

Oh crap. I'm saying pretty clear CDC making recommendations politics need things reopened fast possible instead scientific method. 

See fuck telling people masks need anymore everyone could see Delta India. CDC still even fully recommending everyone mask yet. science says vaccine protects well even delta variant? Norway also get additional 300-400k due little vaccine uptake Eastern Europe. seems like doses divided among countries high uptake. lol country dumb places Welcome America free get shot, get vaccines care health well others. Yay, freedom! state want. Otherwise want feds ban it. see 5 people total hospitalized? see this:

“Only handful people outbreak hospitalized, four fully vaccinated.”

The suburbs breeding ground basically idiotic American psychosis - hyper individualism, maximum comfort minimal forced interaction with, dependence upon others. Anybody know get info Houston area? Cousin (unvaxxed, despite everyone's pleas) hospital bed hallway currently. rooms available. oxygen, COVID positive. Exactly, relatively high vaccination rate makes sense good chunk test positive vaccinated. 

What took away article (and whats honestly really worrying) easily Delta breaking vaccines (while still preventing death/hospitalization course). Take Paxil deep breaths. ok. Time federal mandate. remember vaccines came diseases like polio, chicken pox, measles came out, diseases disappear overnight. diseases still exist, much, much lower rate developed nations thanks vaccines. people get vaccinated, less prevalent COVID become, even among vaccinated.

The main driving force COVID still unvaccinated. get enough people vaccinated, reach points spread low among vaccinated. put things perspective, one person measles infect twenty people, yet vaccines made relatively benign among vaccinated. We'll get eventually, take time. They'll connect bamboo forest outside Atlanta say that's state went blue lol I'm fully vaxxed. want facts. fantasies. Thank much. Chipotle also reinstated employee mask mandate, regardless vaccination status. Effective today  small government always mean state government federal “small” literally makes sense health standpoint point thinking. Major cities spread like wildfire, people die off. cares majority people would vote anyways.  That’s impossible 5,000 people total fully vaccinated hospitalized US. Right?! can't imagine sociopathic freaks call ""pro life"" straight face Sandy Hook hundreds thousands preventable COVID deaths hands. Definitely masking up, thanks! They're Covid collaborators. might wrong, children mostly safe Covid? lmao one well known gay spots North America.

Pride gay acceptance mainstream now. every corporation flies pride flag June even know basic gay culture, yeah super sheltered.

🏳️‍🌈 We'll get herd immunity eventually.. may need let unvaccinated continue take awhile, we'll get there. devil survival fittest? 43% Texans vaccinated, many children 12 aren’t vaccinated (if any, idk there’s one approved age group yet) here! purely risk reduction standpoint, sure.

But that’s thing matters. People understand choices make informed decision. 

Cloth masks still protect others. Oh well... choose better leaders guess. GOP dominated legislature … yes no. “The scientists, along officials Massachusetts Department Public Health, reported 79 percent vaccinated breakthrough infections symptomatic.”

That’s say didn’t get tested prior showing symptoms many symptomatic. want virus evade 2 dose vaccine dosage.

TIL: Covid Biggie Smalls diseases. antiviral treatment readily prescribed Covid infection picked pharmacy. think we’ll fully equipped deal virus. vaccines give us “less likely get it, less likely hospitalized die,” still need “can get rid quickly get it” side equation. Overreach thwart overreach ok me. Cancels returns status quo. numbers probably wont start decline late august. uk cases started rise late may peaked late july. us cases started rise late june will, follow uk trend, begin decline late august. Serious question- anyone power DeSantis overrule anti mask, nothing see policies? may never able ""stop"" it.... like common seasonal flu virus. become endemic modern medical system adjust accommodate crush covid cases coming years. certain point, public health transition private health: protect getting infected. means deciding &amp; need wear high-filtration N95 similar masks, even locales dangerous eat inside. states want Canadians travel there. least (lots us anyhow) vaccinated! No. people want though.   Nobody reacted caution UK, opened nightclubs right surge.  know, history anything go by, sorts political calculations resulted things like ropes lampposts past.

These Pro COVID governors really playing chicken citizens. politics carefully leaving comment truth removed Reddit. folks want vaccine get also wear masks. hurts folks Exactly, they're trying out-crazy become new God-Emperor.

Also, F U, automod, whole thread politics   Yeah well, unfortunately Idiocracy real US giving Goverenment authority inject people vaccines know long term effects probably smartest thing do. Cases spike. People react caution. Case drop. Caution fades. Cases spike. Wash, rinse, repeat. plays well. problem lot people, kind arithmetic beyond call “common sense”. fuckin idiot  yes, itchy throat, headaches, one basically got flu rate entire population least Also, people weekend went home got tested elsewhere?! idea many people unvaccinated celebrating holiday MA. never want know what’s it’s like weak. horrifying. likely teachers school staff though. sub hyped believing vaccines stop transmissions science come it, many people sub hard time adjusting new information. said before, sub ""pro science"". pro-""vaccine science like""

We acknowledge vaccines remain effective severe symptoms delta allows vaccinated people spread virus. one other. both. there's heat wave also ended power loss right?

Stay safe. Ooh that’s good way flip “states’ rights” bs narrative gets trotted out. Abbott dumb fuck. get wanting impose state-wide mask mandates large part state population rural, least let cities defend themselves. Small government ass.  man idiot hypocrite There’s always military medical corps draw dire emergency.   work engineering company work directly Walmart corporate. well Walmart work another company sub consultant. huge push grocery pickup services. several projects planned drive pharmacy canopies nixed favor using space multiple pull grocery pickup.

We saw similar change Walmart operates decided expand grocery items stores 15 years ago. Grocery service accounts 20% footprint building, closer 80% gross revenue store. 

I saying Walmart started grocery pickup altruism. saw grocery stores it, realized would loose customers pandemic unless also offered service. iM vAcCiNaTeD AfFeCt Me? little yesterday's figures today, dropping 30k again. Probably bumps generally downward trend. ONS data UK (which tracks infections via random tests population) suggests infections actually still increasing despite drop official cases (i.e., tests people taking). could given holidays, people coming forward tests UK avoid isolate/ cancel plans. Sure. Close Reddit, Facebook, social media, MSM. Go outside walk. don’t go back sites/channels week. You’ll feel lot better big difference vaccine, know tomorrow (and every day it) much better. COVID, bad symptoms, main thing mind it’ll get worse tomorrow you’ll hospital guess won't.  think governments mandating medical treatment unethical circumstance, personal opinion. Re-watch move, Contagion.

Life Art one same. document notes risk infection threefold lower vaccinated people, risk severe disease death least tenfold lower vaccinated people.

These numbers we’ve talking about. Either there’s mistake ground truth rosy I've seen zero data supporting claim.  Yeah, seems like decision would bit difficult Olympic athlete rest us. hate murderous trolls vaccine good protecting you; others.

It absolutely say ... all. fact evidence health care providers vaccination may
reduce transmission attenuate unvaccinated cases, vaccinated cases (full partial) had:
– 40% lower mean RNA viral load (2.3 v. 3.8 copies/mL)
– shorter mean duration detectable viral RNA (2.7 v. 8.9 days)
– lower risk febrile symptoms (25.0% v. 63.1%)
– shorter mean duration symptoms (10.3 v. 16.7 days)


Why lying blatantly giving link? That’s part I’m hoping for.. county wants smart actually get vaccine. vaccine actually killed anybody? Blood clots anaphylaxis severe, know look treat you. wasn’t “lying”. science time, prior delta variant. Several studies showed vaccines effectiveness preventing asymptomatic infection. asymptomatic infection = transmission. Even asymptomatic infection viral load low transmission unlikely. Nothing 100% pretty close vaccinated transmitting. That’s masks came off. came delta much higher viral loads changed everything. latter. Though may people willing help Uber. 100%. Creates uncertainty hurts business leads people relatively safe staying home don’t to. I’m stealing quote Atlanta fact researchers spend time BS absolutely insane. 11 year old son wants vaccine badly want get family sick. kid understand part caring people, grown adults ""Christians"" get this?  seatbelts. Two coworkers said heard Good Morning America 76% covid cases spread vaccinated people. I’m pretty sure can’t right, can’t figure report heard might misinterpreted. Anyone watch Good Morning America today abs cbs clarify might referring heard?? I’m one vaccinated person team abs try fight misinformation can, need original source can’t find it… Roll tide say CDC covers leaked doc.

Estimate cloth masks reduce transmission 60% provide around 30% protection catching disease.

N95s much protective. question much individual risk willing take. fully vaccinated, healthy 30 something lives another fully vaccinated, healthy 30 something, happy wear cloth mask stores otherwise live normal. find N95s uncomfortable also difficult get properly fitted.  lived kids immunocompromised people, calculation would different maybe would wear higher quality masks. short, think mask quality individual choice, obvious right/wrong answer vaccinated people. Fools all. Stop trying make happen. happening. Sorry friend. Yeah we’re staying pretty close home right No. CDC PowerPoint country. excluded Israel numbers lower due methodology concerns frequently come up. There, reported low 60s preventing infection, also may position elderly, risk people data set.

The numbers CDC used come countries higher rates mRNA vaccination. vaccines usually less effective. room speculate age vaccine type matters, data fully analyzed yet. think basically saying sees writing walls things getting worse doesn’t need anybody tell wear mask tell needs wear one  I’m curious too. I’m day 9 quarantine getting breakthrough case curious contagious still may be… thought going fine partying alot people beach ey? 🙄 God hate state , lived year....worst place ever lived in

now covid cases....colour surprised biggest problem people mask mandates noticed? mandate comes it. CDC calling social distancing dressings rooms closed concerts canceled latest study. call masking, bet places mask mandate tend follow voluntary restrictions private businesses maybe even capacity limits etc. Concerts tend get canceled well. really ""just mask mandate, want mask!"" would bad would truly zero cost.  chance know could find discussions? would helpful share others. Southern man don’t need round anyhow. Vaccine mandate means don’t need mask mandate, that’s moving toward masks indefinitely rest lives. warned delta variant, scientists predicted surge, free vaccine. Maybe next time, maybe next time. Whoops, reading comprehension much 🤪 thank you! remember around September October 2020, Mississippi's positivity rate 100% one week, little testing done. Yup CDC record ignoring everything around world happens US overly negative, yet. It’s incredibly rare things like caught bc requires electronic track trace plus video incident plus genomic sequencing virus people confirm it

So, something like would never even able come US bc doesn’t things don’t see anything showing percentage numbers asymptotic breakthrough cases. know that’s hard figure since people don’t get tested unless feel sick. must rough estimate somewhere. young kids that’s worries most. I’m going breakthrough infection without knowing it. give them. biggest problem going long ass time state legislature flips blue.

Sure, could see statewide election going blue 2022 2024, legislature? gerrymandered shit is, going take lot longer get enough votes right places. Probably post 2030 might blue governor involved process help situation. title incorrect, armed soldiers. military personnel patrolling streets.

#clickbait talking something completely different though - context screwing person posted regards profitability, logistics carried out. Dane County one best vaccinated counties country, currently reporting R0 1.41, despite aid vaccines. 

""Dane County’s current 7-day average daily new COVID cases 6.8 per 100,000 residents. rate for
unvaccinated residents 11.3, 2.5 times high rate fully vaccinated residents, 4.5.""

Additionally, check page 3 cool visualization growth cases vaccinated unvaccinated people. 

Additionally, week's report features plot vaccination status vs viral load. data supports CDC claim vaccinated folks clear decrease viral load levels infected. Long chicken pox* personally can't believe reading things like July 2021. ""See! None y'all tried works!"" need move wall side Texas. I’m gonna ask dr third dose. Good point. I'd love big beautiful wall around Texas good guess, one country exceeded 80% vaccination rate, actually 83% July 27th country Malta. one else world vaccinated   I’m conservative lol. guess similar opinion 99% people real world. subreddit echo chamber. Go outside, life back normal. I'm starting belive assholes want many Americans die possible. That's thing makes sense....why else would threaten people asinine fines againt policies meant literally save lives. eyes, strange-- UK cases plummeting testing stayed relatively steady.

Obviously, thing makes sense 70% UK least one dose vaccine. That's crazy. feel like delta finally delivers consequences kept expecting last year, frequently saw people somehow avoid. think there'll ""Do X obvious bad thing, get obvious bad outcome"" time around. Ravage schools like covid past 18 months? dramatic please. Israels study contact tracing breakthrough cases go CDC statement? spread virus one person, 3% infected two three others. 80% spread, 7% undetermined.

Correct wrong thats pretty damn small Rt number among vaccinated people. Based Abbott's actions quite literally trying kill many Texans can. say wants obvious that's goal. 

&amp;#x200B;

The governor Texas trying kill Texans. Yes, see last link. Yes, great point. ""doing research"" count getting info Facebook?

That's exactly means Illinois this. official state mandate; however mandate federal buildings now. lot counties affected new CDC scale immediately stated recommend indoor. Though, none require there’s still half people stores wearing observations. 

I’m honestly shocked proud NY didn’t automatically implement it, actually reviewing data/guidance unlike many states counties. careful vaccine mandates.

Where work (very progressive state gov) mandate, enforced. someone get vaccinated, wear mask sign waiver. Nothing else. 

We're back office half time full-time Monday. 80% staff vaccination rate. one person know vaccinated stopped wearing mask CDC ended mask restrictions June. 

I hate say it, things looking great. mandates need start bite. vaccine fired would optimal. going disaster school starts. Nuance complicated conservatives... read book sometime uncle Virginia feels way Florida.   people agree stuff? What’s endgame still remember story priest told sermon kid. There’s shipwreck guys bobbing around ocean life raft. Helicopter comes rescue them, there’s enough room them, stay behind, saying problem, God save me. Helicopter comes back, there’s enough room one guy, stays raft saying, don’t worry God save me. Helicopter takes rest land comes back third time. Guy raft tells helicopter go back God would save him.

Of course, guy drowns taken pearly gates. gets there, asks God didn’t save storm. God looked said “well sent helicopter three times!” Covid misinformation Facebook killing people probably ""code black"" they've hit black surge capacity plan, worst case scenario. exact things describe EU valid USA.

No, internal differences EU far wider respect current data underlying trends. I'm gonna quote Massachusetts may vastly different vaccine uptakes, reasons explain different underlying trends (e.g., different uptakes according party affiliation, ethnicity, income etc.) still apply state give insights drive policy. apply Denmark Bulgaria - they're completely different worlds.

Also, EU **not** federation. loose supranational entity tentatively applying common policies certain areas extremely far federation - federal law system, tax policy, job system, language, border policy, healthcare system etc.  agree it’s factor, judging behavior everyone know, vaccinated people aren’t considering assessment risk. They’re evidently aware it. feels like major gap public health messaging. cases rare enough concerned.

Lol moving goalposts. Notice unmasked. seen stories vaccinated masked people catching passing. second it'll higher literacy rate Rule 2. Anyone agree this, please send Abbott kind email explaining stupid. Contact info found 

I live Texas I'm scared, clinic seen covid cases increase lot past week. executive order can't require patients wear masks. patients small exam rooms us coughing place. Right? That’s basically Florida genetic sequencing that, done small number positives surveillance purposes. clinical reason determine ( likely recovered result known) Assume it’s delta now, 90% cases US are. already education though! Alabama. surprising. one dumbest decisions CDC ever get rid mask mandate, vaccination rate still v low. We're higher vaccination rates certain countries Europe we're far getting rid masks indoors. That's scary article. doctor still vaxxed (I am, even ask drs opinion, tbh). talked couple days ago (still telehealth) he's freaking young person died, considering vaccine.

I know people rationalized vaxxing. Every single one seems think never going get ""them."" does, gets someone close them. Georgian, sympathize. Hey, maybe governor start suing local mayors mask mandates, like did! great way spend state taxes. Get it. We're boat. Plus people thought vaccines gonma end niave. Yup - clickbait garbage. Good thing you’re doctor. sell loss. yes expensive, expensive economy shut again. Republican robot says “CRUSH KILL DESTROY, CRUSH KILL DESTROY!!!” Depends come country. Texas Police Department Issues Public Health Announcement COVID-Stricken Migrants Seen ‘Coughing, Sneezing’ state attend school could requirements, course medical religious exemptions. I'm sure different vaccines we've seen measles outbreaks states move block Covid-19 vaccine requirements public 14 states require Covid vaccination. one  60 people ICU Covid 45 vaccine….statistically speaking words paper crap elected guy governor.

They're likely waiting point August enough people chance actually get second dose restrictions freedoms science deniers kick in. Quebec said impose vaccine certificates September 1st, since self-imposed target everyone double-dosed by. cases starting trend upward again, I'm fairly confident plan put action first day they've allowed take effect. Delta variant starting spread **red** cointies oretty aggressively, he's preventing cities inacting protections themselves. dark humor sort way, new order going hurt actually kill voter base. would people get tested vaxxed asymptomatic? people probably much less likely make data.

Ok wear mask rest life there’s always going new variant many 600k died Republican voters? states, margin victory Biden pretty narrow, feel like least vaguely possible enough Trump voters died 2024 potentially winning state GOP become losing state result. think 75% population vaccinated time? - read again: vast majority positive cases, despite vaccinated, *symptomatic*. spread evenly across country. Hell, even California, huge differences school districts. like saying stock market great everyone owns stocks.  party small government strikes again.    They’re probably Covid symptoms. Delta data kind board - 

1. article: CDC internal document obtained Washington Post estimated 35,000 vaccinated people week symptomatic breakthrough infections vaccinated population 162 million.
2. Massachusetts - 4.3mm vaccinated, breakthroughs - 4,450 week 7/10, 5,116, week 7/17. 6,373 week 7/24. Provincetown 800+ those. Source: Virginia - 1,14% infections vaccinated people last two weeks (move slider top)
4. LA - June - 20% infections vaccinated people 

All numbers stand own, numbers Provincetown cluster, draw conclusion. I'm saying data seems pretty mixed, remember numerators (breakthrough cases) denominators (overall vaxed numbers). 

Personally I'm masking public, least while, I'm ready think I'm fresh meat Delta yet. things fall apart, people seek guidance ""strong leader"" best interest cause chaos, death, despair like alone fix reason things suck scapegoat group actions! important understand much overall Covid transmission facilitated unvaccinated, even Delta breakthroughs harbor similar initial viral loads. vaccinated still less likely infected first place, asymptomatic, flush virus bodies quicker. Main takeaway still mask fully vaccinated live unvaccinated thread informative. Scott Gottlieb universal mask mandates fully vaccinated. power grid failed people twice already year there. Seems like state government taking real hands approach everything. Good luck  need rural parts die off, literally. fucking idiots diehard republicans act interest spite ignorance, drive us toilet them. Every major city suburb blue past election cycle. Moved Texas soon could years ago, never move back. Turning dystopian hellhole China able control covid controlling borders well exerting extreme control people. may think worth it, think Americans would not.

\- mandatory quarantine period international travelers.

\- control media stamp dissenting views

\- mandatory city wide surveillance testing. Test tens millions people days new cluster infection suspected.

Considering people react safe effective vaccine US, instilling Chinese style covid control measures feasible without installing martial law. People like meaningless lives corona feel like they're fighting kind moral holy war. gives purpose yeah they're going defend it. Especially facebook news paint non-compliant evil ottomans asked crusade against. I've provide proof immunization levels school including university. idea issue sudden. breakdown percentages everyone vaccinated Massachusetts.

Who knows mix vaccines people Provincetown time.  There's also immediate questions whether HIV treatment medicine and/or HIV prevention medicine and/or common recreational drugs and/or binge drinking impact vaccine efficacy and/or virus severity and/or virus transmissability... subset gaycation spot full vaccinated men carrying many breakthrough infections could explained full permutation options, likely combination them.  CDC obviously hinting sexuality(?) demographics:

**further study underway identify population characteristics among cases, additional demographic characteristics underlying health conditions including immunocompromising conditions.\*\*\*** 

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*\* preliminary analysis matching cluster-associated COVID-19 cases state HIV case surveillance data identified 30 (6%) cases verified HIV infection; virally suppressed, none hospitalized result infection SARS-CoV-2.**  Rest world: ""Da fuck doin dere?"" sounds like large number, brutal honesty think answer no, that's worrying number. There's literally medication prevent 100% deaths. understanding vast majority deaths largely elderly, able body create robust immune response vaccine. 

The vaccine clearly working amazingly, easy get fixated breakthrough cases. wish better tracking (I strongly disagree CDC's handling breakthrough cases thus far), given clear trend hospitalizations deaths overwhelmingly unvaccinated people, that's evidence enough. isn’t first vaccine issue see historically

So let's stop demonization getting it, they're actually ones stopping things going back ""to normal""  That's propaganda outlets come in. Whatever anger followers feel result directed target true perpetrators. They've 25 years calibrate media machines this.

SMH know what's ironic? pro vaccinate wear masks (mandatory) would widespread marches protests. Really strange people value health world messed up. discussion findings report subject least four limitations. First, data report insufficient draw conclusions effectiveness COVID-19 vaccines SARS-CoV-2, including Delta variant, outbreak. population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons likely represent larger proportion COVID-19 cases. Second, asymptomatic breakthrough infections might underrepresented detection bias. Third, demographics cases likely reflect attendees public gatherings, events marketed adult male participants; study underway identify population characteristics among cases, additional demographic characteristics underlying health conditions including immunocompromising conditions.*** DPH, CDC, affected jurisdictions collaborating response; DPH conducting additional case investigations, obtaining samples genomic sequencing, linking case information laboratory data vaccination history. Finally, Ct values obtained SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR diagnostic tests might provide crude correlation amount virus present sample also affected factors viral load.††† Although assay used investigation validated provide quantitative results, significant difference Ct values samples collected breakthrough cases cases. might mean viral load vaccinated unvaccinated persons infected SARS-CoV-2 also similar. However, microbiological studies required confirm findings.

Those important limitations study. already knew delta breakthrough cases alpha. supposed bring table infectiousness fully vaccinated persons. conclusive evidence level risk due possible bias symptomatic infections problems analysis viral load. Like say, might mean levels similar proven.

The mask mandate big problem reason err side caution. Thinking vaccinations work delta comes symptomatic illness need dire restrictions stop spread even vaccinations rates high much problematic though. (CITATIONS NEEDED)  Alright. Sorry sad.

Desantis gone full mask rules. state (TX) signed new executive order making local mask mandates vaccine mandates law. light end tunnel us full FDA approval. think he's going win inevitable lawsuits tries block people mandating fully FDA approved vaccine.

I’m dumbass math stats probability etc chance me, anyone care about, sort severe symptoms minuscule now. yes, pandemic me. carry nonsense. bring it. part. Bye. Proof prior infection probably easy proof vaccination. know someone helped get fully vaccinated went antibody test regular blood work antibodies all. know best way never ever even discussed. mean, Covid alien virus. coronavirus primarily attacks infects respiratory system. We've seen before. Everything common respiratory viruses, including flu. one natural immunity first appeared, spreads faster causes serious illness. would worried crazy surprise side effects.  didn't. listen hoping heart attack air. gets angry im surprised happened yet.

I believe idea knowing enemy. listen republican talk radio know they're whining I'm it. kids show fucking measles meningitis cause local outbreak. it’s everyone’s business who’s involved. you’ve inflicted selfish erroneous view’s fallout them. Good job. People like we’re utterly failing contain move pandemic.

I also blame America hoarding vaccines aren’t even using part gave rise delta variant arising India. places like Brazil backyard probably next site future evolved variants. Watch Alberta Canada months... thing. Reckless rednecks throttle. can’t remember Twitter said they’re “competing who’s best following rules,” mask guidance lifted first time, resonated me. want mandates forever zero risk tolerance show everyone good pure are. (and maybe billion people).

I taking personally people mask socially distance month ago immune-compromised mom died (leukemia). felt like selfishness wanting wear mask get vaccine dooming mom solitude. Fortunately, week died hospital visitation allowed (1 person room time) Shiva service childhood home first time rabbi went grieving family's home since pandemic. able get hugs family mom's friends meant lot. sometimes wonder last 14 months would like could left house seen friends. F selfish f-ers prolonging pandemic. this. reporter summed nicely couple weeks ago way: problem is, anti vaxxers believe even problem. That's actually unreasonable. Obviously New England area skews liberal, higher vaccination rates begin with.

In addition, comments thread point particular mass-gatherings popular gay people, another highly liberal demographic that's likely get vaccinated.

Finally, fact people going mass gatherings first place means felt safe so, indicator mostly vaccinated.

So know sure, unreasonable hypothesize 75% attendees vaccinated. Every teacher strike then. Covid tore UK pretty good last year. guess would combination vaccination+a higher expected number acquired immunity combine limit widely virus spread results steep, rapid drop starts dead-ending regularly.  


If i'm right see another surge winter, smaller one time on, surge smaller smaller daily case counts never go five figures. time tell. That's unfortunate classic example cognitive dissonance poor way people justify things ease mental stress. live near registered daughter schooling. required proof current vaccinations. mean need more? people act like vaccination proof new. whole stupid. hear you. collectivist lens, worry places world don’t level privilege lack access vaccines. Globally, many issues Covid it’s disheartening see done continues new variants. agree - hope Gottlieb right. is, could ahead think maybe that’s UK currently at. Time tell! 🤞🏻 know ancient prophecies said King Arthur would return Britain’s hour need? Perhaps Boris reincarnation. School starts Thursday?  It’s fucking nightmare Texas. afraid kids. 612,098 total deaths US - 1411 vaccinated deaths = 610,687 unvaccinated partially vaccinated deaths.

1411 / 610,687 23 vaccinated deaths every 10,000 non-vaccinated deaths. 

That vaccine effectiveness rate preventing death 99.77%. time goes on, number normalize closer vaccine's actual rate effectiveness death variants, suspect hearing line ""99% people dying COVID unvaccinated"" long time. Given fact big ???s around covid might increase risk cognitive issues, exactly long term effects who’ve recovered infection, isn’t exact quantification kind hard time? results? It’s fucking nightmare Texas. afraid kids. guy pedals misinformation often. Good ol' rule 7's. finance anymore. child virtual learning option last year. pain, difficult best. want again. decided last night going least January. You’re right, I’ve definitely seen sure. worked health team knew safe go ahead get vaccine figured cardiac problems. close friends though conditions it’s much less pressurizing space agree. going way protect people protect themselves.

And someone says kids/immunocompromised, 400 kids dying 18 months puts far away risk demographic immunocompromised people unfortunately need isolate, can't pause lives people could protect isolating. may get ugly. local store saw 5 employees lash management told change. store also requiring customers wear masks several throwing fits about. sounds like extreme overreach state power localities municipalities. Typical republican. mean 4th July event Ptown also famously ends sex party so….  Ah, states value small government see live Alabama. I’m vaccinated. want put fault idiots don’t vax.

My anxiety roof. I'm even sure 460000 possible things go wrong human agreed. schools can't afford though.  rapid tests still pretty awful Could - increase vaccination rates

Being unvaccinated addicting, though. Seems like overreach assume stats smoking would carry vaccinations.

If could find ""Entry cessation programs/attempts"" stats. would relevant one. saw rate increases due smoking lead tries (which nearly resulted failure), would lead us believe would bump vaccinations.

Lot easier get vaccinated quit smoking, ya know? Ok fall different group others.  That's said ""some"". Oh know. I’m pretty much agreeing you. think schism flu-thinking covid-thinking really strange bit sociology. Kids can’t get vaccine, hence school going issue immunity cross reactive new variants? mentioned day here, personally know someone caught twice, 5 months apart. person immunocompromised, take medications, 20s. Mild cases times. explanation given caught ""ancestor variant"" first time, ""delta variant"" time. know anecdotes taken grain salt, eyes since personally know person hits lot closer home.

This classic conservative mindset though. problem personally affected. know lack imagination whatever, inability place someone else's shoes speak seems prevent empathy sympathy others.

And lowest IQ U.S. Let evolution take care don’t believe evolution

The great thing science works matter whether believe not. Natural selection finest. shithole. Somehow US continue seem tout numbers. this, many countries like Israel others saying effectiveness good vs original covid. Breakthrough infections extremely common effective severe infection.

Only US seem surprised breakthrough infections common. wear surgical mask

N95 might use nasal sanitizing spray least 4 times day

I'm pretty sure absolutely nothing.

If choice this, maybe go? Same, got first shot late March. Get shit together everyone else. it? Cool. Thanks posting. lot misinformation, history vaccines medical practices harming Black communities. But, many Black communities currently believe pay vax. Hispanic communities well. misinformation communities can’t afford vax. greatly harming communities rest country. likely? depending test pretty accurate.

A different varient change detection looking virus strains similar. 不见棺材不落泪 covid care paid govt? Darwinism lol population hundreds millions, virtually guaranteed oddballs there.  population hundreds millions, virtually guaranteed oddballs there. 1) we’ve lived chickenpox long time, 2) nearly everyone vaccinated chicken pox never political issue, 3) Different virus, also lays dormant become shingles get multiple times.  lot ""I hearby suspend"" order. someone owns business, tried stupidly “save ppp loans smaller businesses” paid wages life savings, someone done right thing, shut down, shut up, wore mask happily, got stick ensured team did- horrible point read similar headline think “good made sacrifice make yours”?

I everything right. used limited influence make sure anyone associated too. spent life’s saving make sure everyone taken care of. part. 

Now why, fucking care anyone regrets? I’m really hard time facing second shut downs massive team need keep fed happy though new wave. 

At point- let natural consequences sink in- don’t much left give anymore. Bingo! Housing must cheap.

^(and sounds like get even cheaper) explains bump cases bump cases vaccinated. God accurate Missouri would like word. areas country shockingly low vaccination rates. play different ways different places. places see real change death places war zone. Yeah, sums up.  reluctance political ignorance

I mean, one causes other. info advantages Third dose? impression would help longevity protection necessarily increase efficacy short term interview, surgeon general saying (vaccinated people) need wear masks outdoors protect unvaccinated us. I'm hard time wrapping head around that. Like ~~red blue~~ night day. know people bought deep zero covid plan they're literally ready give years lives fight losing battle instead accepting endemic virus vaccines treatment make magnitudes less deadly like flu sure, original numbers moderna look little bit better, granted seems like even 3 provides better protection. what's point vaccinating kids CDC acknowledges herd immunity happen though honestly? vaccines keep infecting others kids extremely low risk seriously ill corona, what's point? Pick one. 

1) Force vaccines people

2) nothing watch unvaccinated kill orphan people walk away scott free ""freedom"".

&amp;#x200B;

It's fair hospital staff exhausted burnt out

It's fair patients need medical aid die suffer permanent injury we're busying tending people could've AVOIDED hospitalization becoming vaccinated

It's fair people trying stay safe lookout others

It's fair immuno-compromised people can't get vaccine dragged risking death gain whatsoever

It's fair businesses who've stay closed go bankrupt can't safely open

&amp;#x200B;

Why EVERYONE ELSE bend backwards risk lives lives loved ones bunch idiots simply refuse give damn happens anyone themselves?

You want tell kids risk death accommodate selfishness bunch idiots?

Why???? everyone else suffer run severe risk account? makes selfishness, callousness recklessness bloody important?

I would MUCH rather give government power end go home one day find someone care died anti-vaxxer's stupidity would gladly spend rest life seeking revenge for.

Their brand murdering selfishness go unpunished drunk driver allowed walk free.

Freedom worthless allowed supersede justice. New Zealand every place Australia except Sydney still zero covid successfully. Obviously vaccine rollout crap, meaning borders closed much longer needed be. outbreak Sydney due government arrogance, delta inherently uncontainable. initially thought could rely contact tracing light restrictions refused short sharp lockdown far late. Surprising one said, DC 600k people something like 85k students. Obviously live DC plenty vaxxed parents states I'm sure gets shared city. 85k go home out-of-state parents (not unlikely, Maryland Virginia right lol) puts rate close ~64% average. USA! USA! USA! GLAD ALABAMA FIRST SOMETHING MURICA FUCK YEAH nonpublic information predicting market going take two different things right now. Shorting airlines cruises advanced knowledge- probably pretty safe bet although increases probability phat federal govt free money. things, market might react positively means federal reserve and/or Congress keep pumpin sweet sweet liquidity. instance, market reacting positively higher new jobless claims expected now. Immunity virus variable.

Immunity vaccine consistently strong. logic me, witch! gotta remember [brace lot people memory actually ventilator. course good thing also bad way don’t really understand sick sometimes Predictably so, saying month people voting shit realistic using common sense?

More frustrating little people think own. they’ve told officially, complete reversal vaccines effective delta variant. know. /s

Ffs, someone shoot space instantly freeze death. 99% nothing worry covid. future going fine regard. Its' amazing everyone ignoring effect vaccination elite athletes. Myocarditis well-known adverse effect. It’s really mean trigger similar cascade aberrant immune responses body? Covid couldn’t literally cause infection mononucleosis virus someone never exposed mononucleosis virus. Perhaps people die Governor get run town. deSantis growing popularity freedom crowd push anything negative him. nothing actually covid sure. WSJ reporting [this isn’t requiring 1.6 million U.S. workers get Covid-19 shots. mandate, unveiled staff memo Friday, doesn’t apply store warehouse staffers, bulk workforce. Instead encouraging employees get vaccinated offering $150 bonus. Maybe thats point. I'd much rather zoom conference opposed going wearing masks.

With mask on, I'm anything unless absolutely to. annoying point. Fair point.

The data sources bottom Twitter thread. right fighting for? right make others sick? Good you, guess.

Seatbelt wearing worth actually saves lives.

You can’t get shot arm that’ll reduce chances dying fiery car crash 99.9%, could, wouldn’t need seatbelts either.

As said, strap M95 mask you’re worried. vaccine protects me. mask protects you. agreed. want it. vein, i'm surprised antivaxxers equally concerned unknown 'foreign' (from racist perspective) virus circulating bodies. seem totally okay that. believe banned government oversight power utilities well. Corporations finally realizing going hit bottom line. trade whatever dumbass sue worth it. know would go nowhere anyway. Keeps dust nose I'm gardening. Abbot needs go further!! want drive opposite side road drinking tall boy playing Clash Clans mobiles. god-given RIGHTS. Move? 🤷🏽‍♂️ Yeah someone Zimbabwe isn’t visiting US anytime soon. Western countries make bulk travel eachother. 3rd world, needs vaccination, won’t generally result global spread new variants. fuck automod Sorry people die party’s hubris. I'm ashamed Texan.  GOP full willful idiots take advantage them. Thankfully yes. We're vaccinated. symptoms past couple days. shortness breath last night chills/fever fatigue. fatigue felt lot like got 2nd dose.

Today went nasal swab test tested negative though. really felt like COVID though. Pfizer Moderna boosters specifically formulated target Delta? Versus simply giving people third dose existing ""pre-Delta"" vaccine? 

Why little reporting status adapting MRNA vaccines target Delta?

I'd first line. died pandemic still voted Trump? Sounds like finally found AZ voter fraud. backing posts adding additional perspective getting patronized ""it's Covid"" pretty heavily downvoted (at time) making valid point. Unfortunately, Reddit culture toxic replies assumed arguing you.  Curiosity got me. North Dakota New Jersey aren’t hot right now. aren’t screaming news? He’s murderer “Texas Gov. Abbott, COVID enthusiast, today issued…” mean, think money matters Abbot local people Texas. literally got massive ""donation"" power companies weeks ago, said Texas anything help people pay stupidly high electricity bills. There's requirement wait FDA approval. least one court confirmed context college's vaccine requirement. felt like narrative even last year went “you wear mask” “you ENJOY wearing mask” quickly. It’s weird me. wore mine supposed to, miserable. Wearing work talking day straight unpleasant. Somehow saying became terrible thing say though. brother vaccinated tested positive. careful there! Mask up! bet ass Biden issued nation-wide mask order, Gov. Abbot would first one line refusing comply touting ""states rights"" basis. Even conservatives would agree fucken weird. Abbot entrenched loud side base he's forcing cities *not* care residents. It’s New Jersey New York That’s well good choice could kill harm someone else. Personal freedom include right kill neighbors willful ignorance misguided beliefs. (/¯ ಠ_ಠ)/¯ worse decide touch start conversation states actually implemented CDC mask guidelines?

I know county/cities sure whole state has? good father like kids weird one even bothered asking question states different laws anyway. data 12's yet. get it, approved EUA, probably couple weeks. high think peak go daily new cases time going back down?

""United States COVID: 35,604,136 Cases 628,594 Deaths - Worldometer"" K-Mart still open? not, mouth breathers go work Hobby Lobby. don’t remember I’m done checking think it’s Arkansas Missouri. governor calling members Arkansas General Assembly come together special session, possibly early next week, consider modifying rescinding law passed year’s legislative session prohibits state, including public school districts, imposing mask mandates. nutjob Liability protection Wal-mart Well I'd say everyone going run fits Someone else chooses reduce risk same. 


People go around - including youbg children, immune deficiency people like cancer patients, yes even people choose endanger themselves.  deserve death even begging it. Republicans wanted ""limited government"" power. I’ve heard number may waaaay higher testing breakthrough lands hospital. Scott Gotlieb example said today thinks 1m infections day. would mean way breakthrough (non hospitalized/non tested) think.

Obviously that’s one mans opinion, track record right. Hard compare fatality rates when, time around, elderly population (most vulnerable covid) also vaccinated demographic group understand it. infections delta among younger people they're ones getting vaccine, think they're invincible. fine end ICU

And big picture thing angers refusal even *allow* precautionary public health measures. people died covid 2021 far entirety 2020 yet leaders proud actively obstructing simple precautions would save lives. Fox News new material good month lol Still better holdouts deny existence Covid intubated ... lengths people willing go protect ego scary. disease never gonna leave us I'm Nebraska air quality index unhealthy today due wildfire smoke hundreds miles west.

I get point, saying lol Abbott literally dumb tyrant needs put prison. first amendment part constitution. EO. analogous all. Secondly, restricting towns something locality spikes limiting government positive way. ability Texans preserve livelihoods protecting lives.""

I think meant *decimating* lives. I'm still waiting ""facts."" look far enough think provide citations.

You've commented multiple times, continue bait argument, ignore I'm saying, unable cite claims. concern troll. Period. That's sub. sure citing numbers total death counts we're talking kids.

Of course, sure. We're talking highly transmissible virus. Children transmit virus, get vaccinated, yet. Scientists working that. 

What trying argue about? Seriously? I'm saying need follow proper mitigation measures, ignoring that. Completely. 

it looks like spend day picking fights people subreddit. that's called trolling. needs happen schools open safely?
School closures impacted children many fronts, academics social interaction, equity, food security, mental health. CDC recently released guidelines opening schools, noting decisions safely open schools consider levels community guidelines prioritize five key mitigation strategies, which, layered together, minimize spread COVID-19 correct use masks cover mouth nose
physical distancing
frequent hand washing
cleaning high-touch surfaces maintaining healthy facilities
contact tracing, combination isolation CDC guidelines physical distancing vary school level degree community transmission, assume everyone masked. CDC recommends least 3 feet students elementary, middle, high schools community transmission low moderate. transmission high, students divided separate groups, called cohorts, maintain 6 feet distance cohorts throughout day. CDC also recommends minimum 6 feet teachers students times, minimum distance 6 feet masks off, lunch guidelines also recommend improving ventilation, opening windows doors, example. Ideally, schools access testing students teachers symptoms, well routine screening identify asymptomatic cases. acknowledge vaccination teachers important, require returning kids less likely adults spread coronavirus?
Most children become infected COVID-19 virus symptoms, milder symptoms low-grade fever, fatigue, cough. Early studies suggested children contribute much spread coronavirus. recent studies raise concerns children could capable spreading recent studies varied methods, findings similar: infected children much, more, coronavirus upper respiratory tracts infected amount virus found children — viral load — correlated severity symptoms. words, virus mean severe high amounts viral genetic material — studies measured viral RNA, live virus — kids prove children infectious. However, presence high viral loads infected children increase concern children, even without symptoms, could readily spread infection That’s feels like me. imagine want things back ‘normal’ also accept probably catch delta variant. workplace can’t really trace origin 9 us, fully vaccinated, tested positive COVID week finding exposed Sunday. UK vaccinated, think big difference.

For fully vaccinated, 57% vs 49%, partially, 70% vs 57%.

Seems like huge difference me, maybe is? like wants ruin everyone else's life happened reply waiting for. 10% seems high tho lol virus shooting us?! Going fairly big wedding tomorrow. worries COVID leading this, I'm pretty nervous going even though I'm fully vaxxed. Here's hoping. US live North Jersey Except Texas. /s kids school said ""Sure wear mask need social distance day."" Honestly concerning. One observation, anecdotally, masks recommendations dropped *for fully vaccinated people*, saw tons parents making obviously 12 children wear masks. kicker: ""Bloomberg identified 100,000 vaccine breakthroughs."" ""Seeing"", ""Filling Up"", never metric historicals context thrown - ever. I'd rather zealous weird lack information leaks CDC causes unnecessary anxiety


Not CDC news general. Like weird report vaccines help prevent long covid one small report peer review Texas. least Florida amazing beaches notion GOP Russian control trying kill many Americans possible sound far fetched now… live USA somewhere else? Per US CDC Director, breakthrough cases occur rate 1-2 20. means 90-95% protection infection period. vaccine still best way this. part hasn’t changed true, would much expeditious, least I’m aware of, Pfizer request third dose amendment EUA authorize quickly, opening access people much faster go doctors get label third doses.

I also clarify post largely snark; I’d like things post haste. Gov. Death appropriate name moron. Wait happens FDA rejects full approval ? I'm gonna wear one anyways.


ANARCHY ANARCHY ANARCHY wonder constant vilifying unvaccinated people blaming every outbreak going ease subreddit news like these. time Alberta Saskatchewan lift precautions - including longer mandating quarantine covid positive people testing people unless ""severe"" symptoms. noticed. shitty thing? cause spike cases hospitalizations, going embolden anti-vax/anti-mitigation people they'll proclaim ""the vaccine even work all, COVID stay, time live it.""

But, stupid. addressing content. one planned next week. I’m going Yosemite. cancelled last year. Could someone explained it’s clear transmission coming mostly unvaccinated vaccinated individuals increase chance mild asymptomatic cases don’t prompt testing? Unless everyone consistently tested know vaccinated people spreading unvaccinated develop symptoms?  mean shit like ""If enough people care, gives virus time mutate something hurts people protected it""?

I'd love reassured. Lol fuck Texas what, 3rd time they've chance make good decisions. Appalling. said another comment, “mental gymnastics” thing referring several early comments thread saying exact opposite article said. example, fully vaccinated people weren’t showing symptoms. know much research methodology, I’m commenting Reddit board coronavirus  want decide gets medical care doesn’t. It’s understanding main issue w-r-t vaccinated folks 1) Breakthrough infections common 2) vaccines work said infections still mostly asymptomatic, meaning easily spread unknowingly 

So worrying issue people unwillingly unvaccinated, like young children immunocompromised. yet it’s issue “The vaccines longer protecting us.” It’s people can’t protected properly vaccines yet danger. Yeah I’m tired seeing “what’s big deal? It’s mask! Nothing lost wearing one all!” Feels like twilight zone episode. Yeah, crucial tool mitigating spread. fun, enjoyable, big deal, anything remotely positive. suck. guess people disagree that’s fine, wearing one it’s “the right thing do” far I’ll ever go mask spectrum. Indeed, viral load. see reason assume possible HIV meds leads higher loads. Otherwise lot would hospitalized. I'm correct is. Reagan puppet many people, sickening. study literally says cannot draw conclusions vaccine effectiveness aka specific medical term quoted studies. conclusion viral loads symptomatic patients equal non vaccinated, whereas previously vaccinated individuals ~30% lower viral loads. datasets tiny Ct values(viral load) ~120 vaccinated people. 

“The findings report subject least four limitations. First, data report insufficient draw conclusions effectiveness COVID-19 vaccines SARS-CoV-2, including Delta variant, outbreak.” really trying vacation right tho?

Since, vaccinated lowers chance contracting spreading virus immune from. 

Which making law criminalizes wearing mask public would criminalize people neither COVID came contact anyone COVID. 

Unlike wearing pants objectively waving penis people street.

They’re taking every report 100% completely, totally, vaccine. correct. said CDCs data suggests serious breakthrough infection leads hospitalization death extremely low.
In end that’s trying eliminate here, hospitalizations death. It’s working data supports math change. math math. stated fact, lockdown stop temporarily soon remove lockdown, spreads again.

Lol hardly. accurate say sub pro-""science-I-like"". right. science keeps pivoting. many people want pivot change behavior unless evidence overwhelming, case, kinda late ever changing situation.

Even research studies published severe symptoms transimissibility, people saying science wrong, data incomplete, sample size small (I'll happy come back comment edit examples later). Suddenly, everybody acted like PhD-holding editor JAMA something. Whenever good news science vaccines, seem complaints scientific process though. 

So that's say sub selective science. selective science want accept, that's ""pro science"".

Sitting back watching Abbott similarly crazy shit makes realize there’s future Republican Party. CDC upping amount stuff panic Delta get vaccine fence-sitters roll sleeves, point Walensky saying we’re variants away vaccines useless.

So far seems like it’s slowly working, despite fact there’s valid argument messaging convince vaccinated people shelter place, anti-vaxxers continue giving crap. Texas seems Variant universe, soon probably inhabited variants. You/we won’t get rid virus, it’s endemic. You’re willing sell civil liberties virus high survival rate, don’t get back. You’re distorted perception is, it, willing sacrifice. rhetoric, using terms like sabotage idiocy, true villain, one half thinks half mere foot soldiers tyrants. Take look mirror.  Serious question. mechanism US Federal government override governor actively taking steps put population risk? Every time see article states passing directives *outlaw* public health measures, blows mind... like they're payroll virus itself.

Like want issue statewide mandate masks vaccines, whatever (I think that's wrong, blow mind). *actively legislating* private businesses cities/counties *can't* implement public health measures contain virus sheer madness me. Sewage human. Vote Texas. Please. I’m talking moron made assertion nothing policy wise could done differently.

Australia, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, Atlantic Canada - went elimination able grant freedom people keeping safer regions.

You also say “wasting time theoretical” responding theoretical question could done differently. don’t want theoretical discussion, don’t literally start discussion theoreticals. long, partner. Elimination could, would require political there. likely international coordination (if eliminating alone, re-enter eventually). Living Ohio I’m incredibly shocked isn’t list. Yeah, hard science difficult lot people get news people facebook mean this? many school-aged children hospitalized? Dying? 

For record, I’d prefer governor let cities bigger hand local COVID response, seems bizarre we’re using exact rhetoric year ago, yet half population fully vaccinated deaths low they’ve since pandemic started. Except allowed leave borders infect states. Besides society meant help other, improve livelihood etc. opposite that. get selfish affects others. Move mountains become hermit one would give shit. Otherwise what's difference making someone feel threatened physical violence could lead death threat passed virus knowingly could lead death? hope 🤞

(has vaccine) conclusion article masks true way prevent transmission. vaccinated people spread COVID unvaccinated also other, transmission generate new vaccine-resistant strains (as article argues), looks like we’re masked future. Vaccines clearly aren’t enough. It’s limited government sense limiting power city governments make mandates. 

Leave individuals make choices. anti-vax people different smoke, take medicines, drive recklessly..etc etc. least vaccines protective equipment now. We'll treat everyone comes same.. governors charge mask mandates? really mask mandate, opposite intention normal. governor makes us wear masks, makes sense could tell us well, right? maybe im one. seeking understand That’s it. math breaks rate transmission isn’t known

These need calculate Bayes denominator usually blown respective terms well.

Risk infection given vaccination = (probability vaccination given person infected x risk infection baseline)/vaccination rate  According article read, risk infection 3 times lower vaccinated, opposed somewhere around 6 times lower Alpha.

This matches numbers countries. GOP, party big government! knew Yeah. Zero indication folk psychology argument reimplementing mask mandate would stop people getting vaccinated would true, quite opposite far. understand people posting mostly vent frustrations, still. dead republicans tho.  *licks lips* Yup schools start, we're another surge strain actually spreads easily... week 3, going see lot upset parents. you, I'm immune virus I'm going get. recommend boosters make available, I'll get soon possible. virus going go away. choice change life much what's still possibly fruitless effort avoid new flu that's many times contagious take chances vaccine unknown potential long term effects COVID, I'll take later point. truly bizarre eye-opening peek echo chambers time time. gonna take many kids dying realize mistake is.

Yes, people do. people use argument justify getting vaccine probably never going get anyway. Low vanilla COVID.

It matter, downvoted. That's happens deal fanatics. different flat-earthers.   question also define news, I'd SHOCKED respondents considered news would consider news. adjusting expectations. People saying ""we need distance/wear masks/lockdown we've beaten Delta Variant we've beaten pandemic"" operating level reality. Covid around forever like hundreds viruses. high vaccination levels, deaths continue rare. 

And panic variants (as long vaccinated). sub passionate making people think vaccines useless provide high level protection hospitalisation death (which really Covid problem first place). People also love talk inevitable super variant evade vaccines really seem much evidence happening/will happen. mean could happen, could anything, need sensible projections. replying to, issued executive order banning mask mandates. aslo racist executive order, basically called profiling possible immigrants, main source Covid.  Sean Hannity keeps talking terrible New York I'm pretty thankful live honest. herd culled, huh Spanish flu affecting 18-45 year olds badly children infants always increased risk flu. ROLL TIDE !

Do believe everything government tells you? Wow I'm shocked. thought Jesus would cure covid vaccines. would've thought lol  Sorry hear that. 
Don’t let infection dissuade putting stock vaccine(s). 
You likely fare much better vaccinated. 
It sucks sick, outcome vs. unvaccinated likely night day. 

What know Delta simply easy spread even vaccinated people close contact. 
We may roll back expectations intimate contact people. 
It sucks hand dealt. 

Good luck. What's pretty wild Washington DC, success story. last Covid death July 16th. Hospitalizations trending downward. Vaccination rate high still increasing. However, DC Gov still reinstated mask mandate based CDC guidance. Scott Gottleib thought CDC Mask Guidance targeted higher risk individuals. think move needle much. Also, keeps pointing people using masks protect wearing high quality mask fitted correctly. I've people ask **""Can walk pharmacy get third dose?""**

The answer maybe, although mileage risk may vary. I've known people walked claiming first dose successful. However, officially approved, hook anything happen. 

Will anything bad happen? likely not. speak someone get another round shots vaccines state records even though know gotten before. I’ll join you. demand bailouts states mocking last 18 months. guy work BIG covid? benefit have? anyone surprised?  Where's violin?

If country's gonna go like Titanic did, might well go style. (Begins playing music) official cases winter wave hundred thousand per day. amount undercounting really changed much? doubt increased, kind doubt increased enough get 1 million cases. (And 1 million cases, low deaths, almost complete lack symptoms one bothering get tested. goes publicity Delta putting people hospitals easily.) lazy, wonder implied case number would get looking deaths versus expected death rates age group/vaccination. 

Re: deaths, pretty good point elderly people heavily vaccinated, makes sense deaths drastically lower. No, that’d detrimental public health. based ids, folks don’t live near dmvs/can’t pay ids wouldn’t able get them. undocumented immigrants would spreading mutating virus would affect us all.

I relate, stand 2 weeks intubation, sudden movement made dizzy hell, hard believe able move week would made body weak, reason hands tied stay ICU, patients love remove huge amount things get connected Worldometers still reporting daily cases Florida wed-saturday. Sunday-tuesday lumped 3 day average. rolling 7 day average already 14,209/day 99,463/week. someone POC mean can't asshole. dont hate Republicans vaccinating hate unvaccinated vaccinating making covid last refusing vaccines?.

Even you’re getting right now, doesn’t make right. incredibly sorry state failed kids. It’s bullshit. I'm legit shocked would've sworn FL way state's run days. would suggest government provide support this. However appears government abandoned support people. likely completely screwed.

Please pay special attention point #3. happening media admits NFLPA probably wouldnt agree. Vaccination indeed like 90% protection. 
Also, movie theater audiences shoveling snacks soft drinks mouths almost entirety show, Broadway audiences members likely eat drink. maybe one glass wine something beginning intermission.  
So ""masks-while-not-eating"" still nearly effective vaccines utterly useless Marvel movie screening something. love hear listen people thought trickle economics, Vietnam War, Segregation, Anti-LGBT laws, tax breaks rich, Iraq war, Donald Trump good ideas telling allowed protect pandemic killed millions. stupid country society let mental midgets take conversation?

Unfortunately seems though viral load similar delta variant vaccinated unvaccinated individuals infected. ""Four guests vaccinated two unvaccinated minors, Royal Caribbean International said statement""

Presuming family, 100% eligible people got vaccine Arkansas legislature banned use masks. meeting next week due rising cases revisit governor's request. 

I hope repeal it, knowing Arkansas much hope. They're finding vaccinated transmitting virus much non vaccinated. that's true likely need mandate both.  people get infected, go icu, dead, people go get vaccinated. country already demonstrated impressive ability produce distribute vaccine. rest, always, race vaccine next vaccine-proof variant. People aren’t going get vaccinated faster point. vaccine available free almost 5 months now. people wanted get vaccinated, would. Locking isn’t gonna motivate anyone. mean, it’s still sad regardless. critical factor people likely fully vaccinated people vaccine least effective, people likely hospital given time: elderly, immunocompromised, people serious conditions complicating recovery illness all.

So looking mix people coming hospital really useful thinking vaccine effectiveness. fancier stuff case-control studies, put Pfizer 88% effective COVID right man lives state denial: ""The governor claimed Texans ""mastered safe practices"" help prevent avoid spread covid-19.""

They've mastered art gaslighting themselves. still goes initial data vaccine 98-99% effective preventing hospitalization. 

This nonsensical conclusion context. Vaccines supposed *prevent* 95% hospitalizations *that would otherwise happen*. Meeting number requires much less 5% people contact virus hospitalized, every unvaccinated person contact virus would hospitalized either.

However, cannot determine much less (and thus cannot quantify efficacy), know enough demographics affected group. said year, you’re one full bs Less one fucking TENTH percent even (0.08%) Lmao ""plague"". Please stop 😂 way put it? personal freedom argument bullshit involuntarily getting others sick. People get sick. recover show symptoms. Life goes on. isn’t plague disregard human life shocking

I see anybody shocked conservatives' disregard human life anymore. policies hazard individual and/or public health safety, decades. too. wedding coming up, know do. Anecdotal evidence I’m paramedic half COVID patients going hospital vaccines. It’s also important admit none severe infection, mostly call 911 panic.

I wouldn’t surprised breakthrough cases pretty high. New shots vs. first shots…wouldn’t first shots new shots md rest J&amp;J (assuming aUS). No. FL **may** reaching peak. Rt number seems like might decreasing bit. Still little early tell (and lack reporting make little hard get true sense) FL drop like we've seen delta drops, overall US numbers start look better (assuming CA/TX/NY dont take off...) Oh, sorry. thought meant increased number tests.

But additional measure took. trust outside cities measure imposed. last wave hit India really hard, almost everyone could get infected already did, think under-reporting now, tho certainly peak. have. 

And guess care America I'm coward. immune compromised, probably checking doctor. 

Unfortunately, isn’t guidance health authority, knows? ""But vaccines approved took decade make they're safe ..."" /s Florida entered chat. used big government defeat big government /s

Hypocrites gonna hypocrite things like make certain lockdown pt 2 happen That's thing. FDA *killing* us approving damn thing already. hundreds millions people point. Approve fucking vaccine people stop using dumbass EUA argument. Literally, even east Vermont covered smoke start week due western wildfires states telling people stay inside mean…maybe meant they’re willing die. Yeah honestly think ever end.

Why high percentage symptomatic infections? thought vaccinated cases asymptomatic? logic asymptomatic included testing know? people inevitably die, every politician charge voted jailed voluntary manslaughter. saying best way prevent COVID spreading give everyone COVID  kidding me? two year old cancer - thankfully chemo far well. got it, wouldn’t count?!? WTF. Good see people realizing this. OK thx ! agree may worse flu, going away, matter do. pretty much going wayside Spanish flu. probably us forever less deadly form time goes on. Also, getting downvoted speaking facts? actual science showing vaccinated people spreading virus, albeit lower rate unvaccinated.

I didnt need government health agency approval vaccine. Covid scary enough. Ill gladly experiment fine care, like I've done part getting double-vaccinated (quickly) keeping wearing masks distancing whatnot. said care still manage get infected result people drawing longer longer longer. virus still persists, get back normal expedience, variant cases showing states even smaller amount brought aberrant events Delta variant, surprising whatever place we're right now-- pinning theatre whatever-- keeps going 2022.

Rapid, guess. gave results 30 minutes later.  right what’s fucking wrong media people hate it. 125k breakthrough cases many vaccinated Americans? Give fucking break. That’s less one FUCKING percent. Dude wants President bad going kill people prove 66% would right inline Israel's original studies Pfizer vs Delta were. They've since come back said Fully Vaccinated Pfizer vs Delta 40% efficacy symptomatic infections. still 90% stopping sever illness hospitalization though. They've forever. imagine happen physical conference requires masks people go “unofficial” events one wears masks. 

Otherwise agree you—zoom conferences blow, they’re better masking up. downside *all* get infected Delta scenario, vaccinated not. even mild COVID sucks shit. Meanwhile CDC rash, reactive incompetent keep recommending masks know stand vaccines new variants. Good luck getting cat back bag. agree fact likely happen, would doable. would cost lot take months, would work.

36.8% fully vaccinated

41.8% least one dose. Yeah, join club. since OP appears UK include well : CDC ending mask rule middle whole Biden unemployment thing good PR move... (is) bullish raising teacher pay tackling environmental crises Florida facing (specifically Red Tide). 

When first elected toned rhetoric down. However, response (or realistically lack thereof) COVID made GOP celebrity summer ended people we're pointing Florida anti mask utopia. true. highest populated counties Florida ignored him. mask mandates, fined businesses enforcing them, etc. He's basically useless aside bluster make feel bit silly getting vax, even though know that’s probably dumb. got second shot felt severely sick couple days. I’m perfectly fine now, sounds like still get covid anyways? 

And know vax reduces chance hospitalized age health already extremely low chance Barely 48% us fully vaccinated. imagine doctor poor nation(who's waiting get vaccinated) feels this... Creepiest part people cheering. know evolving situation, it’s back forth That's major change

An unsurprising one. Encourage mask BS exact reason Delta spreading they’re saying spread I’m worried immunocompromised ppl 66 year old mom Christian him. getting third shot? 60 immunocompromised? Unfortunately NC blue Triangle surrounded deep red. hands much tied situation especially legislature distributed. There's winning, envy position right now.... 
-a blue NCer living Triangle pissed rest state's idiots. A-fucking-men. It’s infuriating assuming OP 60 Israelite. Don’t pedantic Well, vaccine working, good delta. Israel studies show quite high breakthrough cases lower effectiveness vaccine delta variant well. want natural immunity, follow please. give medical community. upper 80s-low 90s % effectiveness severe disease Delta Israeli data. Seems he's referencing. Here's original Like red ball cap stupid slogan it? Art school grades? UK ended mask mandates, still masking bunch. ""nobody's suggesting getting booster shots yet bro""

israelis 60 fact somebody US fail, intentional sabotage particular party. US made available enough vaccines every person US, capacity vaccinate 8 million people day. failure citizens dragging country them. intentional sabotage citizens govt trying protect. Good! Buh bye!   listen doctor Depardieu I'm home get high sit wondering long covid high? No, haven’t.    plot show R0 delta 5-9, chickenpox 8 also popular summer tourist destination. Lots people coming over. vast majority. literally like 99%. They're probably playing soft (for now) increase response rate. I'm guessing they're attempting poll better idea next steps. disagree. believe everyone still unvaccinated hardcore anti-vaxx nut. believe right message carried right messengers could made difference beginning. late though. saying avoid Universal Orlando? 


 that's sounds like saying. US currently ACA (obamacare) mandates insurance accept people regardless condition, law took effect insurance could deny people raise rates virtually reason. Even though obese people make large portion deaths, still unlikely die catch virus. you’re 60 vaccinated shouldn’t worry much.  Since last comment deleted ""political"" (kind hard subject matter). going say Abbott cohorts doubled hoping would go away certain orange someone inept handle crisis. People rightfully mad anti vax, fallacy see people seem think avoid another lockdown. vaccines losing efficacy delta, see come fall Hey, stay house instead marginalizing entire population people. horrible take. immunocompromised never lockdown forced either. Covid going away people part reach herd immunity Covid gets flu like levels. Sounds like get vax wear mask Getting incredibly disheartened near-term prospects Covid. really hoping vaccinated people done thing. 

What's going happen fall? wedding do-overs, cancelled again? take newborn see grandma? “protecting people” also means protecting you, people wear mask Same. I’m trying extra pissed it, yes, vaccines means back normal life faster, also damn. supposed do, slackers get reward? It’s high school group projects again. Don’t ask more, you’re getting any.

I get it, really hard wear mask public? Last time went Universal (a months pre-covid) got sick hell. way I'd go now. suspect one reason Florida struggles case numbers least part due tourism, there's reason increase potential exposure like 10,000x+ point time. kind view Disney World, Universal, etc giant overpriced chickenpox parties atm. Good idea. Corporate America responsible citizens. we're tired protecting people delay end this. Last year, willing waited vaccines protect people. We're there. we're delaying people getting immunity virus going away extending duration pandemic. There's miracle vaccine around corner sterilizing immunity we're waiting anything. point we'd like get back normal lives. likely virus less less dangerous time Lmao there’s literally vaccine tourism foreigners come travel US, get vaxxed, go back  Click bait fear mongering point title. 60 crowd already knew. isn’t brand new information Hey would mind posting article?

Another 25 million? Fifty million? hundred million more? Something right here.... health insurance rewards program gave like $30 worth gift card points getting vaccinated. fully clear offer customers straight cash get it. And? Grocery workers probably vaccinated exactly reasonable path forward point? don’t mean question come across antagonistic, fatalistic. 

The cat bag. People form restrictions. things dire report suggests, don’t see reasonably effective way mitigate what’s come. know point, I’m going back office unless everyone household vaccinated, transmission drops 1% locally sustained basis. Honestly never quit source: past sub teacher. Like said earlier, mask mandates likely won’t wide spread time around. It’s gonna mixed know got downvoted, honestly, vax viral load vax viral load, vaccine doing? assume stopped testing day first shot given. almost 18 months this.

""less two years"" say. define ""safe"" yourself, look hundreds millions (Perhaps billions point, i'm sure) shots given side effects thereof compare data people received shots. one person (who wary) got vaccine another family member would probably stand get on. getting shot saying didn’t get it, getting sick, shows anti-vaxxers “look Karl didn’t get sick” kinda crap. That’s I’m getting at. fair guess?

Ok cool, spited enough get $100 dollars, I'll go republican circles discourage many people possible getting vaccine cuz ""life's fair"" Wat free rider problem meen  went slides. new piece information viral load breakthroughs. rest known data studies. things effect individual.

[Here, I'll give head Missouri Supreme Court came back saying state comply expansion. sent lower court force state government comply. Agreed. I’m still aiming COVID. Despite vaccinated (I small child still N95 masking anyways. Nothing new us except staying home even now. Bummer Thank you! partner BinaxNow test came back negative since either cold COVID, PCR test today - hoping negative. want speak authority none.

You seem know majority people. even know b cells. power ya! Yea, it’s deja vu thought CDC specifically denied funding research gun violence Congress years ago? isn’t true. Data becoming clear vaccinated people fact spread virus, lot easily previously thought least. there's plenty FREE vaccines anyone age 12 months? seen mention before, Sturgis ready kick like week? get vaccinated collect money. It’s almost like that’s vaccine Lol. We’re concerned unvaccinated hear you. anti vaxx crowd insane untrusting science NOTHING CDC could said past, could say future. 

We doomed start. live Idiocracy. Well, is. Even vaccines enough keep virus spreading exponentially. implications huge. Vaccination longer viable solution. We're going living way long time. cites combination recently obtained, still-unpublished data outbreak investigations outside studies showing vaccinated individuals infected delta may able transmit virus easily unvaccinated. Vaccinated people infected delta measurable viral loads similar unvaccinated infected 

So delta spreads vaccinated people easily unvaccinated contagious chickenpox. Science calls Universal Masking going even CDC did.  would explain increasing numbers reports entire vaccinated families getting infected. sounds like good approach. hope government gets something similar going they’ve started approving at-home tests It’s moving me. I’m getting vaccinated collect money. Going need booster soon anyways. Agreed absolutely true. Singapore reporting infections (Pfizer) vaccinated individuals Delta variant back June. CDC slow respond. known better.  Previous variants much less viral load vaccinated people much less likely transmit others, vaccinated people wear masks made sense based that. difference much higher viral load transmissibility Delta variant vaccinated people aren’t *quite* protected anymore (but still significantly protected) aren’t barrier transmission were. true people left hiding it. Everyone thinks it’s right lot people reason hesitant get vax either lying masking getting vax. It’d hard sell current numbers areas.  Fucking hell. Narrator: vaccine kept a-mutating. Country’s full debt one gives shit clearly. I’m going get vaccinated booster collect cash. people mass vaccine site area fake name tags case wackos got upset something. surprised. 800 cases total
.but 800 could trace one outbreak point it’s fair say it’s vaccinated people well. There's tw major gaps information 

What defined showing symptoms? they're defining things could contributed allegories middle summer that's worthless 

How many vaccinated people area actually exposed time frame vs breakthroughs? 10,000 vaccinated people exposed time frame place suddenly changes data drastically kid 12 ER nurse family member. said:

Our hospital filling again. Almost unvaccinated. People expect us panic shocked say Covid. one cares anymore. We’ve year half. didn’t want vaccine don’t feel sorry you. 🤷🏼‍♀️ awful thing print. Household transmission rates 80-90%. No, alas. experiment done test tube. would still need done get finish line:

* whole.lot *in vitro* experiments, turn prospective treatment
* See worked animals kill them
* Go series safety trials, gradually increasing scope
* Show better (more effective, and/or safer) best available alternative (which vaccinations improved versions we'll then) Yeah, that’s good point, would great catching asymptomatic transmission. extra precaution people allergies, acid reflux, migraines conditions cause symptoms similar covid ones (runny / stuffy nose, sore throat, etc). It’s unrealistic people self-isolate 100% time indefinitely. course, rapid tests would need reasonably accurate. Since you’d every day, probably wouldn’t need sensitive brain swab pcr ones get health providers. i.e whereas pcr tests might pick positive course e.g. 2 weeks, rapid ones might get viral load highest, maybe middle week something. that’s you’re infectious case. least that’s general argument I’ve read favour widespread rapid testing. knows, could misinformation guess. 
I agree you’re feeling sick (i.e. something status quo, since significant part population kind condition causes least one long list potential covid symptoms constant regular basis), exposed covid, it’s best stay home case, get lab test since they’re accurate. everyday testing, think rapid tests would helpful.
It would ultimately come good detecting whether someone’s infectious. whether they’re sensitive lab pcr tests. they’ve often compared know that. Still don’t believe it’s major part lack getting shots far. Lol, zoom graph fluctuations size every days. And, none scares you, US covid much higher chance costing fuckload money. dont agree understand train logic. someone sitting home quarantine breakthrough, symptomatic covid (Pfizer, March), I’ve coming conclusion myself. able vaccinate entire world variants continue develop hotspots. virulent strain like delta tearing world fairly quickly better chance creating widespread immunity. pretty shameful, tbh.

OP made bullshit editorialized title. original title translated doesn’t say single thing anyone protesting vaccine. protests UK United States?

It doesn’t seem right able post article another language, make title narrative. course not. that’s fair comparison, gay doesn’t affect health family others.  world wide pandemic, think something yourself, get vaccinated, get loved ones vaccinated. south needs better reason? Democrats getting vaccinated. don’t care, right thing. millions dying every month worldwide, thinks joke Vaccines tool halt spread. whole ballgame we’ve treated That’s definitely here. know plenty people vaccine hesitant, lying saying vaccinated. isn’t reason anyone get “vaccinated secret here”, population falls two main groups. People shame others getting vaccinated, people say “it’s everyone’s personal choice want”. people reason lie two don’t want backlash getting vaccine. Looking India. screw responsible citizens got vaccination without bribing. Like women poor welfare receive benefits kids without required use birth control. Negative!

I’m worried “I lived long term chronic health issues limiting expensive.” ain't sticking nothing nowhere anymore body. society wants, that's fucking problem. Get fucked lmaoo.

Healthier I’ve long time. Turns sitting house day incredibly bad physical mental health. Research funded Donald Trump's legal team, probably. inhumane they're us. Let go. least Alabama governor calling people don’t get vaccinated True, would interest moderna, Pfizer johnson discuss maximize mutual profits. Although illegal happens time. 

Roger's Bell Telus example Canada. Fine, claim vaccinated terrorists. head coach Nick Saban recorded public service announcement encouraging people get waiting on? I'm sure charts looking at, one substantially worse spike 7/2020. work Ozarks attorney literally elderly couple tell didn’t believe vaccine. “You mean like Santa claus tooth fairy?”  No. don’t want told do. “You mean like thou shalt kill?” No. don’t want government tell us do. “So don’t murder people please don’t drown children bathtub?” No. don’t want registered. “You mean like driver license?” President Trump told us get it. “He got it, thought proud quickly invented it.

The reality vaccinated older people still risk virus. almost every single older person UK double vaccinated right now. Therefore get sick, die, counted fully vaccinated person getting sick dying.

How natural immunity look now? siege vaccinated begins.

Requiring masks instead vaccination real Mickey Mouse operation. Yes? half country.

And call tracking people tf wrong you?? cannot adult, one ignorant history.

The goal ALWAYS avoid overflow Healthcare system, achieved that. NEVER vaccinate everyone. people move goalposts go power grab people like want keep handing rights over.

I agree want novel vaccine get it, want (because scientific know long term data) right take it. 

This virus 98%-99% people complications, vast majority people underlying issues. kinds numbers kind virus mandate people get vaccinated. dropping healthy people dead ages insane mortality rate, maybe could make exception, CASE.


EVERYTHING said line science says data shows, disagree it, back response  pretty much non-issue. bed several days - big deal. natural immunity. yet could used thst money already got vaccinated. shouldnt punish people making right decision quote refers nationwide cases particularly surging areas low vaccination. 97% people entering hospitals right Pfizer oral go together   would propose world would done?

There's many people planet one thinking beyond Covid? gonna keep getting vaccines every new virus? People gonna die yo. Yep, get shot, grab mask, let’s this. vaccine exposed hundred times adverse affects.

Governor Satan rescue Well, look Israel. crunch numbers looks like doesn’t matter do. people 50 hospital covid, 60% vaxxed. 40% vaxxed. Natural immunity starting look better vaccine reduce symptoms. Peace ✌️ lmao yeah are

i'm sure Biden's team strategy get states comply clear reason non-risk group get vaxxed

Assuming vaccine safe (which science far shows is), clear reason get vaxxed simply greatly reduce chances getting sick.

I'm non-risk group too, someone told vaccine common cold, I'd shit. Colds annoying fuck. Getting sick sucks, even severe enough hospitalize you. 

Why want prevent that? do, dont. Malaria kills people never gotten weaker. Yeah, exactly. Basically everyone interacts anyone arguably expensive zone A. ffs even day player, get Covid test day day go fitting. like crew *isn't* protected. need photo ID? guess alone enough trigger insurance company?

Exactly. rewarding stupidity laziness. ever situation teach us hold dont get screwed. Great points; agree urgency vaccinated twice (by infection and/or jabs). see, however, lot people double vaccinated suffering mild illness catch covid. think everyone *need* booster, although see harm everyone receiving it. think making sure everyone 12 wants first 2, gets young(ish) age groups 18 50 y/o. Unfortunately here, UK, seem vaccinating many people 18. could have, near future, 18-year olds triple vaccinated 17-year olds none. proving point LOL joke, it’s joke, JOOOOOOOOKE (sing me) Good idea. Source? directly contradicts cdc link above. fact, says 6k hospitalized, 27% asymptomatic, hospitalized different reasons happened test positive despite fully vaccinated. also plummeting India vaccinated people since delta wave passed. seems Delta passes quickly. ‘Merica! need rights spread Delta !” Florida.
The armpit USA. better backtrack everyone vaccinated. Yep Everyone fully vaccinated, live life like that. 7  Gotcha. Yeah, I'd pretty pissed 17% lol.  Type “1” you’re stroke.  Missed distinction.

That said, would expect FDA weigh side effects/risk vaccine vs risk child public health. &lt;looks general direction Arkansas don’t even think lifting mask mandates.

We also need keep Rt 1.  okay, sure Immune systems work too. thought read virus always mutates become less deadly (but contageous)? really don’t. There’s reason to. vaccines work literally decide get one whenever want. could understand another lockdown initially couldn’t even get appointment there’s excuse now. either get don’t Wise precautions , wish well rumors I’ve heard. might age well though CDC finally announced release studies tomorrow support policy revision. dozen staff staying masked work public - we’re vaccinated work place thousands visitors per day, mostly unvaxxed unmasked (lots kids distressing number proudly unvaxxed adults).

.... Right?

So decide want send kid roll dice wait months vaccine.

You should. Live best life, also wear mask public, fewer people die virus. Good...good...let vaccine flow It’s Missouri, sister works Arkansas wife Louisiana.  crazy common too.  it’s semantics, “I faith” less specific kinda wishing things work out.

No, mean like someone says “I faith God”. sounds like “I trust science” lot people. 

Especially since people saying “I trust science” aren’t ever looking studies data themselves. It’s reliance, trust, media reporting “the science”. I'm exact situation. I'm office full people constantly ""brag"" tough get vaccine. working home full year without issues boomers forced us back around late May doubt we'll ever go back remote work everyone's denial. Needless say, I've looking new job since then. Christians view pandemic catching virus. them.

Being persuaded believe something based demographic really good gauge sanity. 

My point reality entire situation, people denying benefits vaccines people desperately trying push normalcy without view bigger picture (which much factor current resurgence virus anything else whether want admit not), people selfish. assuming they'll anything outside selfish means pipedream. lot us choice. way keep lights on. 

You call pessimistic want, seen much lately optimistic about, so...you know whatever. Also, show emergency room--unvaccinated--for laceration, they're going test covid. show vaccination card, going test me. That's understanding anyway.

This depends individual hospital practices. instance, UCSF [tests everyone (see tweet hospitalized comes ED even symptoms. Call ""Vaccine 45,"" something. [Vericella's R0 3.7 - seems right based estimates R0's Delta. turned on.. holy shit. can’t believe it. Darwinisim* ""There's censorship there's deleting comments people argue bad faith""


Lmao that's definition censorship. replied one idiotic replies I've ever read. I'm close contacts longer needing isolate I'm numbers data people infecting others large. overkill.

But actual confirmed cases needing isolate straight insane laughing face science, data know already. Well insane. bright side lots cheap houses sale shortly. news lately Yeah! people never lives go work take care kids provide family go school.../s I’m game it’s tough ethical/political question whether re-vax many can’t yet get vaxed all. system view we’d almost certainly better sending vaccinations e.g., Madagascar individual view boosters could make big difference. Israel already planning boost over-60 crowd. Seriously, vaccines even end bullshit Delta, will? 

1) might able avoid Delta variant (at least enough people get vaccinated) people COVID-19 precautions seriously, 2) gotten enough people vaccinated COVID cases going go end time... (forgive me) just... like... the... flu. 

It always going way, matter trying get point less governments going make us mask mask forever?

We really first place, lot flu deaths could avoided. Wearing mask public every year October March would shame did, because—sacrilegious, know—masks zero cost measure. **They block communication, impede exercise, quickly get stuffy warm weather. **

I really think huge inconvenience. Wearing mask public category wearing seatbelt would shame did, because—sacrilegious, know—masks zero cost measure. block communication, impede exercise, quickly get stuffy warm weather. 

Should stop signs voluntary chances COVID getting eradicated riding bicycle Mars;

Technically, never point, like polio technically still exists, small pox. Herd immunity, original sense, still point we've got learn live virus return old normal. 

For lot people, ""normal"" good first measures supposed temporary, permanent.

It really depends specific measures talking about, think gets define ""supposed"" happen. But, want blame anyone, blame people never did--and still don't--do needs done fight virus: people dragging thing ""the CDC said Delta's making vaccines almost useless

That's brilliant. reading companies jumped vaccine train yesterday, couldn’t help smile. It’s time. Everybody deserves safe workplace. Kansan here. part got shots back april. Wish idiots would. 18 year old freshman, I’d say nothing’s getting better time choose courses next semester, take gap year can. Threaten give dose immigrants. they're wearing mask already ""ousting"" themselves? sounds like cry baby tactics. Good. Sure. that's legs group biggest pants want let us pull pair.

Never mistake it: population wields absolute power, refuses use it. closer get governing body single individual, better representation governing body.

The thing is, goes ways.  really uncommon state step ""reboot"" local government that's fallen apart gone absurd path another. Democracies tricky keep running, local governments tend entirely missing one key branches, judiciary.

The way ends working states actual sovereignty reserved constitution, municipal governments effect allowed exist hosting state government. don’t think many places try enforce. lack NY CA seem tell story. I’m interested see seasonal. south starts peak decline towards end august north picks leads kind seasonality. dont know sure seems delta hits hard may burn quickly. UK showing promising curve downward recent delta spike.  someone tried shame getting vaccine, would kick life. 

This becomes problem live rural shithole ""someone"" everyone. High vaccination rates summer people outside virus harder time spreading. Bullshit CNN...Bullshit Mountain. Get vaccinated. one going care. Seven people reported hospitalized.

That &lt;1% consistent with, less than, variants. even delta infectious virulent...at least vaccinated. must met Dad head CDC say 1 10 1 20 vaccinated getting covid badly again? Idk data cdc come on. lock whole country This.

Also mRNA baller. cell uses make spike protein help body build cells breaks like cellular function. Really amazing. can’t wait see cancer imagine mRNA vaccine teaches body kill cancer. Freaking awesome. guess? exchange happened text, knows. I'm sure we'll talk again, nothing beyond superficial brief exchanges family gatherings. never close, that's always been. Kinda dread seeing now, though, it'll bit awkward. People longer following state emergency there. Foot traffic essentially same. entire University California Health system making mandatory. That's 26,000 people working hospitals, clinics, etc. Auburn UAB fans give shit Nick Saban. NJ resident, downloaded Murphy’s vaccine records app phone don’t carry card around time state starts requiring proof vax. Holy shit. whole thing troubling, explains CDC clearly right thing recommending new mask rules. live area lot unvaxed live, tell essentially nothing increase vaccinations. people riled point view COVID vaccine one greatest sins inflicted upon Man. hundred million dollars get go get vaccinated. like everyone work got raise despite high higher evaluations. paper, right. Nothing changed me. certainly would upset rewarded made better decision everyone time needed. 882 people tested positive 7 hospital, sounds like vaccines job, That's 0.79%. Well. stepping power vacuum crested someone lead.

It's appalling got far, rather nobody.

Anyway, can't force deal anti-vaxx bullshit owe anyone jobs. Unfortunately, American electorate is, might actually help presidential campaign.  NGL, normal circumstances, masks minor inconvenience, high heat + humidity, quite onerous. Cool! maybe stop overdeveloping stop encroaching animal habitat causing situations potentially created disease first place! What's that? want money? give benefit doubt, new things learned every day, they’re changing recommendations according current information. 

They us dirty saying didn’t need masks vaxxed everyone took despite 30-50% people getting vaccine. keep mind CDC requiring wear mask, always local authorities. Agreed. hundred times. It’s keeping lot companies afloat amid slow slow times news. Obviously downplaying threat covid know it’s dangerous still through. “we won’t return normal lifetime” pretty fucking extreme. second imagined brother stuck actual boat antivaxx, conspiracy theorist wife. Good, go safer church right take precautions respected. next time wait item know likely go sale future. right. time doesnt make difference already happened They're also losing ten billion dollars either way. Bad luck terms timing. nothing “get”. missed point entirely context original conversation. Listen stop jumping comments pretending you’re smart. Media hard work. Shaming antivaxers creating divide. It’s already established one cares young kids. See: flu shot rates child death due flu. It’s even dangerous kids COVID, one cares. 186 kids died flu 2018. 

Get damn flu shots people!

Side note: hope combo COVID/Flu/RSV annual shot comes fruition mean they're personal freedom issue right? Unless they're massive hypocrites something. used less loaded term given context. whole thing becoming exhausting. People need get already think might right. mean, America's also soaring yet olympics. saying good time olympics think pin olympics greater reasons. people getting paid didnt get (at time). example people get rewarded extra 100. like work everyone got raise you, work them. course would upset. Same, exposed indoors 3 4 hours. Even took test 3 4 days later confirm. i’m starting college weeks university reinstated mask mandate top vaccination requirement. really thought going get totally normal freshman experience guess That’s true. Olympics empty part. governor said we’re allowed mandate masks. Broward trying mandate anyways. successful, think (Palm Beach) county same.

If mask mandate, guarantee kids wear them. Pretty spicey stuff man worships God known vengeance. I'm personally glad pays fair share taxes.  Look people dumb media making way much money this. firmly believe come next January latest things start come back normal. 

Look - plant survived plague plague continue don’t let fear ruin everything. Frankly masking going destroy immune systems going create super MRSA hand sanitizers. 

Keep calm carry fuck media.

Edit - imagine social media 24/7 news media small pox? would died lol idea many people vaccinated, previously infected mild symptoms? that's Jesus would do.  global pandemic scale would highly unethical, also really stupid Pfizer, Moderna, Astrazeneca J&amp;J form cartels. There's way one would find make public would get sued existence governments world. Risk high screw people's health right I'm looking death hospitalization charts. I'm also comparing statistics show ~97% hospitalizations unvaccinated even less lead death. Biden stated address today ""this pandemic unvaccinated."" words problem, concern, free walk local pharmacy get vaccinated *today*. largely personal problem point. major factor, Russian linked operator caught paying social influencers money peddle bullshit BioNTech vaccine.

They hardly biggest problem, almost everything, certainly help planet large.

(Note: social media influencer story aimed US actually, whistleblowers people France Germany)  Even frequently elderly population still important know effectiveness vaccine virus changes. Every single person who's died Covid immune system, clearly protect them. work them, think it'll work anyone? number kids age 18 died low hundreds. ~75 mil lines inconsistent mess comes covid requirements.

Really they're trying find way something fundamentally make sense right now.

It's actually very, very, simple: time go cruise.

Yes, sucks people employed industry, lot industries. every industry people found gainful employment *should* exist arbitrary circumstances. cruise industry one already lot strikes it, food borne illness, worker exploitation, environmental issues.  Seeing scaled back smaller volume would painful short term, bad thing long one. Fair enough, missed mild part common covid people mild symptoms long term symptoms. happen sure calling common ridiculous. articles came self surveys people said tired media blew said young people mild covid long covid. second morbidly obese ppl. gross ass state far people go. bet you’re outlier though- fight good fight haha. Yeah, straightforward math people get vaccinated, breakthrough cases happen, vaccine 100% effective. population 100% people vaccinated, vaccine 90% effective, 10% people would still expected get virus everyone exposed. symptoms would typically milder, hospitalizations deaths compared unvaccinated population. play Democrat games health safety. Sane people move.

Thursday, 882 people tied Provincetown outbreak. Among living Massachusetts, 74% fully immunized, yet officials said vast majority also reporting symptoms. Seven people reported hospitalized. virus 98%-99% people complications, vast majority people underlying issues.

This completely untrue. data shows 10-30% people infected end ""long covid,"" cases heart lung damage never go away. happen even mild infections even previously completely healthy. study garbage. app made advance people show proof vaccination, add QR code scan get places requiring proof 49th education. Lol listed simply first steps vaccine requirements. federal mandate, next best thing, business.

It's drop bucket drop none less.

The bottom line need vaccinated people, high percentage possible virus loses advantage far less chance mutate.

If raging pandemic 55% vaccinated 15% vaccinated maybe get still pandemic. that, every single person gets sick virus sees antibodies give chance mutation. 

It's numbers game. know two people like … they’re convinced absolutely logical evidence vaccine significant risk reigniting chronic conditions past mom told day people like fiancee (vaccinated since February) might making people sick. try keep questioning admits real evidence, feel like new conspiracy every time. Honestly make mandatory question ask refused get vaccine did, use resources elsewhere.

Wait... disagree. get vaccinated go grocery store. curbside. inconvenience people get vaccinated. enough people know you’re douchebag, huh? Sounds like took nursing attention. Glad longer nursing...we dont want They're definitely vocal minority. like anyone UK going protest vaccines considering readily available everyone 18+. vaccinated people get shot move witj lives.

Maybe national registry vaccination (states would submit data would mess) incentives/bonuses based that? don’t know. like 6 people admitted ICU interior, accounts unvaccinated. Rising case numbers mean rising ICU numbers people vaccinated. told us get vaccinated that. told us needed get 70% eligible adults least one dose that. moved goal posts said 80% that. say anything herd immunity. goalposts keep moving. Nope. Look 'T-cells' 'polyclonal antibodies'. Immune escape affect vaccines natural immune response, can't negate them. Meantime we're working revised vaccines already vaccinated people exposed variant infection levels prime immune systems. building portfolio immunity time different ways. Yep vaccine hesitant crowd definitely seems vocal minority they've managed get almost 90% adults vaccinated far. without qny incentives offered. see masks eventually going away gradual thing going forward. 

There won’t another big CDC announcement whenever it’s deemed safe take off, blowback got May guidance.

Just increases highly contagious variant mean 'failed'. US, would saved 500K lives successful SK. don’t think getting vaccinated disguise means someone hesitant, means want private. 

If, say, worked Catholic Church might hesitant pick birth control prescription, wouldn’t want boss see it; could fire it. Federal Government require vaccination regular test private employer can. Public sector employees tenure retirement benefits risk. private employees ""at will."" think Russians blame?

I shunned way often like spending Sundays getting blitz drunk watching cars drive circle. fact able enjoy activity took place building bartenders staff.

There's actually whole world that's excuse drink beer. know grew up, though. Clearly havent missouri. Sure theres farms here, theres everywhere, farms towards northern part, democratic part. south go, methtized gets. I’m sure punish word would use, bit slap face us already done part didn’t throw temper tantrums it. 

Don’t get wrong. protection main thing I’m glad that, damn could used $100 too. Actually UK covid dashboard 88.4 adults received atleast 1 dose far. Bear mind thosr 18+ eligible shot UK. offered yet teens think plan apart vulnerable source data (linked Israeli health ministry website), one periodic can't read details since mostly Hebrew break quite well show number cases. definitely testing antibodies (what even mean that, vitro work, actual infections found country), slide 7 looks like mostly symptomatic also includes asymptomatic detected cases. measured efficacies symptomatic COVID-19 total detected cases nearly identical. seriously keep promising awesome shit result getting shot, like longer needing vasectomy, upgraded DNA, etc., I’m sitting shooting potent skeet genetically predisposed number health issues like March ☹️   Except ignoring long Covid. Something everyone seems ignore saying like flu. mild case flu doesn’t give ton symptoms months, possibly years even permanently, later. you’ve seen areas lot unvaxed live, might different perspective. poor long time ago. get point apologize anyone that's impacted situation. made smart-ass comment based headline without reading article. Hello, name Mr. Snrub, come from, uh... someplace far away problem is, people limit lifespan making overall health costs lower without issues. might cost given year, quite bit too, since spans fewer total years, overall costs lower. I'm sure is. vast majority, way. Disney closing again. Leaving always easy western world. People think difficult. take steps needed: send job applications, book plane/train/bus ticket, pack bag, step bus.

I done plenty times youth never hard, matter money not. people actually find hard mental hurdle thinking logically taking necessary steps. get stuck minute details. want record every instance mail Supreme Court next time someone challenges Roe v Wade. I’m perfectly satisfied free vaccine protection I’ve had. Holding deadly disease hopes $100 really big gamble super high stakes. conspiracy shed mRNA ""vaccinate"" people around you. works, allegedly, editing genes. 

I wish creative enough make shit  ""Yep! want tombstone? Democrat, fallen propaganda?"" Key word: said eligible population i.e. UK get shot currently anyone 18+. Although think plan offer teens deemed vulnerable soon teens. link gave think overall population around 70% thr UK offering vaccines teens. 

Looking thr UK covid [dashboard](http://Key word: said eligible population i.e. UK get shot currently anyone 18+) 88.4% adults yh he's pretty much right gather younger people going bars clubs full capacity now, that's biggest difference capacity spread like wildfire underestimated opinion. *Overall, 1,089,475 people 36% Arkansas's population fully vaccinated.*

So barely 1/3 population fully vaccinated.

Gee, connection? positive negative? really still looking day-over-day numbers nearly 18 months thing? Last Thursday's case count nearly 40k. People big loads tend ejaculate virus. Source?  Binax test 5 family 3 positive 2 negative. Seems like good alternative can't get tested anywhere else. got appointment see results correct days Even reading first paragraph thinking managed differentiate vaccine effectiveness vs Delta variant's effect obviously paragraph article also note reviewed study yet:

""Natalie Dean, biostatistician Emory University, said data point two possibilities. Either vaccine’s efficacy mild disease decreasing slightly, emergence new viral variants made look less effective. “It’s kind modest decline, keeping perspective number still high.” also emphasized data collected, vaccine remains effective preventing severe disease."" fact. Manitoba’s hair shy 80%, too, second doses hit Labour Day first doses crawl eventually stop at—I’m guessing around 83%. religious/conservative towns south, near North Dakota, **WAY** lower. think public health orders literally Warsaw Ghetto something. Premier (*Governor* American) hiding ten days he’s terrible Covid whitesplained First Nations Genocide public. vaccine shedded, hmm🤔 founder Bill Montgomery (and equally dead covid). awfully tempting. fall too, sometimes. offense, uncle preacher speaking truth congregation. He’s actually authority figure people could reasonably change minds. 

Instead he’s essentially lying save reputation, may cause die. actions good Christian. Probably lockdown could see mask mandates returning Winter “serious states”. Malaria even caused virus opened 11 days ago northeast pretty high vaccination rate doubt it'll high usual. know NJ 70% vaccinated I'm aware. person implying people hesitant bosses, unless I'm misreading that?  Oops. bad. Sometimes forget check trolling dive discussion. American mutations already? need remind U.S seeing nearly many cases per day india Delta discovered… people want act like U.S small nation small population… PLENTY available hosts virus mutate here. 

Mind im overly concerned new variants case numbers alone. deaths hospitalizations rise greatly ill concerned.  I’m UK right correct I’m wrong difference step 2 step 3 lot larger step 3 Step 4. UK mostly open anyway, don’t think significant changes people’s behaviours cause another surge. get point but... look curves infection, compares schedule Olympics, keep mind tested every day made quarantine, please explain Olympics responsible crowded trains Tokyo ?  Canada hospitals fine vaccines yet lockdown permanently many times changed stance vaccine effectiveness? ""under control""? 0 cases, cause never happen. &lt;1% test positivity? tells us? would like forced wear masks would least like benchmarks look for.  say ""corona symptoms"" that's one vaguest answers could give. ""Sick fuck"" could mean dozens different things bunch different people. specific Speaking myself, want get point hospitals overloaded enough people vaccinated away things we've lived last 15+ months. looks like vaccinating substantial portion population way achieve that, previous generations measles, polio smallpox. Many us boat. School starts less two weeks sending unvaccinated child school seems downright irresponsible. *Dr. Ronald Petersen, directs Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center....""It may months people get back square one, think would conclude necessarily going permanent, lasting condition,""* 

*Dr. George Vavougios, lead author one new studies.... ""There telling course, we're early stage, whether reversible slow burn toward Alzheimer's dementias, something dissolve months, weeks, years""*

Yeah, fill unbridled optimism either. It’s fucking surreal witnessing world burn last year, lives got ruined ended, overall chaos. thing could literally end people like nah I’m good, there’s something vaccine don’t understand (probably someone failed high school biology) don’t comprehend science goes making I’ll go whatever little Facebook meme politician says it. fuck guys. Hehe I'm sure anyone able fake vaccination status it'll world's talented actors! Really, hundreds unvaccinated children every corner community interact school day likely one infectious Delta?

The US new COVID cases country world right now, except perhaps India *if* assume India underreporting cases. Chances get hit new variant rate it'll US' fault.

And parts world access US vaccines either. do. hospitalization death shouldn’t focus point comes vaccinated people. Long term disability front center, it’s not. Many would agree you. Especially last two years covid19.
That said, doubtful ever abolished. No, young unvaccinated kids home. teacher state masks declared optional. I’d like level protection make likely don’t bring anything home kids. covid tide roll Well, total numbers Florida still winning 193 now, probably since saw number... Lol remember sub insistent delta fearmongering data delta severe, despite ICU doctors throughout India reporting younger people getting severe symptoms. 

This sub pro-science, let's face it. pro-wishful-thinking selects science justify them. get started fluoride chemtrails. Ok cool I’ll Yup, another article manipulative title ridiculous thing say. Big money British studies. Come through, England, we're counting you. That’s probably good we’re going get FDA gives full approval. “no evidence vaxed people spread it”, accurately “vaxed people likely limited ability transmit covid”, decent assumption given priors, though (and early year studies show limited transmissibility vaccinated people original strain). seems different “no evidence covid spreads planes” Says who? J&amp;J recipient, I'm sure do. think large events going require proof vaccination masks. Lollapalooza required everyone vaccinated present negative test. conventions I'm going within next months also requiring this.

I personally think things die bit fall, surprised there's another winter surge. people talking point realize sound exactly like anti-Vaxxers using things like blood clots reasons get vaccinated? It’s logic. “This thing doesn’t happen often, anecdotes extra cautious”. we’re going tell anti-Vaxxers trust big picture data, needs done across board. low probability person wearing mask fully vaccinated going get child severely ill. State California announced days ago healthcare workers. pain story anecdotal, take it’s worth. guy mid-70s contracted, recovered COVID. I’m sure it’s dementia, guy lost election 7 million votes, tells everyone listen won. Dude I'm even American. Hence freedom bullshit talk even laughable, nobody else jerks shit.

I made plenty sacrifices ignorant people country went around parties indoor family Christmases led five month lockdown. people complained lockdowns masks done fucking thing prevent us endure instead ranting shit read Facebook. 

And concerned open borders. borders open Americans couple weeks I'm terrified they're going bring next wave upon us get vaccine rates high possible. “Stop telling damn democrat.” mother’s response urging get vaccinated days ago. us cannot work mask? live entertainment industry work masks. Sounds interesting, booster specifically targeting Delta variant (so it'd mRNA coding Delta mutations). believe would lot effective it'd make sense. great advantage Pfizer vaccine modifications mRNA code could made quickly cell-based vaccines.  Ah yes, chickenpox… 9, mom found neighbor kids chickenpox, neighborhood moms arranged brief “play date” could get with. Overall, numbers lower younger people are: 

Latest CDC numbers fully vaccinated age:

12-15: 28.3%

16-17: 39.7%

18-24: 43.5%

25-39: 48.5%

40-49: 57.6%

50-64: 67.1%

65-74: 81.7%

75+: Wow. Delta much fun Also right remain silent always new variants, always new variants blowing communities little immunity covid. may actually last time happens US. Michigan one extra outbreak last spring, fueled UK variant, counties hit hardest barely seeing covid right now. That's probably country's future, starting weeks months.

Your frustration shared many, going permanent means. Put mobile FIND ME! j/k appreciate reply. Sounds interesting, booster specifically targeting Delta variant (so it'd mRNA coding Delta mutations). believe would lot effective it'd make sense. great advantage Pfizer vaccine modifications mRNA code could made quickly cell-based vaccines. like thing could respond to, that, don’t want accept fear. Literally thing respond to.

You’re invested still choose blame government sending sick migrants around. 

Why don’t force vaccinate instead blaming other? catch border, send crew immigrant warehouses border force injection? long enough collective belief Jebus, pray virus away. Thats Good know. Glad people coming through. respect tremendously. [Essentially Chickenpox returns later life contracted Silly, least they're it. Go figure They’re also working nasal vaccine COVID, that’s different inhaler filled virus/variants, no? That’s HIPAA works. Yeah fucked This. Children immunocompromised really unvaccinated demographics actually feel really bad right now, ZERO sympathy anti-vaxxers. can’t read article due paywall numbers don’t make sense me, anyone help?

882 infected;
74% 884 vaccinated;
7 people hospital (unknown whether 7 people vaccinated unvaccinated?)

Can anyone (kindly please) help facts math? seems like important bit whether hospitalized also overlap group vaccinated. still cite 75-85 percent protection infection. Florida here. 

You guys get face coverings? exemptions must abolished even talking about? lol 

Oh look DC reinstated mask mandates must flu season :/ Archive link: Lol Kinda defeats purpose go parks. I'm staying home. literally show proof get in, OK sure Good thing HIPAA laws tell people we're vaccinated not. perfect example cannot nice things. THINK chances getting extremely sick low, completely healthy younger people die immune systems went extreme overdrive. never know would case you. Yes, chances fairly low statistically chances absolutely next zero point becoming sick. one going Disney world right smart. Also hot Right, lot places already lot natural immunity, know protect hospitalization pretty well. one way another we're going back normal we'll ever get winter. 

Looking quickly peak UK coming maybe shows Delta much infectious, burns hotter faster OG virus last year. Let's hope doctors imported they'll fighting covid canned soup whippets instead ventilators. Backup link: kids get shots? get breakthrough infection infectious hell without knowing it, get kids sick can't even get jab yet. kids getting ill dying. care enough contributing bear mild inconvenience little longer?   We'll agree disagree then. Public shaming work anywhere else working now. pastor made clear church accepts Republicans, Democrats need apply. Yeah! immunocompromised people never job, need take care kids, provide families, go school... stay home foreveeerrr. people they? jobs us immigrants..  indoor outdoor orgy? everyone masked? need context reflective efficacy. 95/5 = 19, close 17

You probably think going much higher media reporting % vaccinated vs % unvaccinated hospitalized patients, reflective efficacy.

The bad reporting unfortunately made many vaccinated people feel like invincible are. get wrong, vaccines effective go clubbing every night place substantial transmission, still putting lot risk. get milder case vaccinated, viral load still matters. sure said accurate, quick check, sure.
And yeah, states exemptions laws, kind.
 states make harder get said exemptions, fact exist. 
They differ slightly state state.
Just particular college required you, entry, mean laws exist. sort expecting this. moment got politicized we're going hit 70% full vaccination herd immunity. We're 50% think we're going bridge 20% getting lot infection getting lot people sick. sucks big time.  can’t say agree everything article, provides interesting discussion points really useful data. teach preschool vaccinated teachers masks summer, leaving one unvaccinated teacher (who hates masks still wears chin half time) wear mask. health dept ""strongly recommends"" even vaccinated teachers go back masks.

Yea tripping up, we're sending school armed cloth face coverings stop virus equivalent chicken pox?  90% crowd vaccinated, 10% tested negative. There’s need worry That’s true all. still cite 75 percent 85 percent efficiency slide infection. less likely catch someone unvaccinated. think people losing perspective thread due overwhelmed.

Absolutely great advice here. want wait, that's why.

Pfizer may develop something better, timeline clear surge infections already (in Israel is). trust facebook Karens modern medicine, oxygen level drops. Then, show hospital help, instead facebook friends told get vaccine. Video games Oh, Alabama. devil fools best laid plans. CDC\] must continue emphasize proven efficacy vaccines preventing severe illness death acknowledging milder breakthrough infections may rare all, vaccinated individuals transmitting virus.

I've saying weeks breakthrough infections rare... all. data places like Israel supports this, personally know four people fully vaccinated still tested positive.

Public health officials really need come shoot straight people vaccines great job keeping people hospital, new variants + waning immunity means there's still very, good chance given enough time going get COVID.

Pfizer bullet point recent Investor Relations presentation they've completed first trial batch delta-specific vaccine expect begin clinical testing early August. want bring efficacy symptomatic disease back originally OG COVID (the 95%+ studies late last year), pretty much given need approve disseminate variant-specific boosters. Important note people pointing Repubs changing tune, would appear vaccination masks, clarify misunderstandings. read actual presentation there’s heavy emphasis vaccination effectiveness People really spinning here. good news I'm sure people getting idea doomsday scenario. Unless 12 certain health conditions… 80% wrote straight wrong disinformation. vaccine means “rushed”. resources thrown probably anything outside world war effort. Millions people exposed virus everyday life data came faster vaccines wait enough people get infected measure outcomes. FDA review approve standard safety clinical trials (3 phases, longer term monitoring ongoing, standard new drug vaccine hits market). 

We also 16-18 months COVID data, 12 months vaccine data shows effects COVID much worse, likely includes many ne long term, much prevalent health issues death far vaccines (like factor 1000). Billions doses administered. billion people vaccinated. numbers waiting for? 

Maybe update assess risk. already approved it, bet would complain rushed process. Even that's you, lot people would. process takes time, rush it. addition, major events cancelled means huge amount money lost them, venues, vendors, host cities hence big events like Lollapalooza went ahead scheduled year required proof vaccination negative test.

I volunteer conventions much money lost last year due everything cancelled. Even though insurance covered ""an act god"" clause, tell happy either upped premium rider sky high made financially even tougher events cancel again.

This year, conventions either requiring proof vaccination, negative test and/or masks depending local guidelines, unless local government orders events shut down, they're going ahead scheduled. Many cannot stomach cancel yet lose yet another huge amount money unless insurance wants cover everything I'm sure they're going best avoid. start paying people get vaccine? bet there's plenty people  would take fifty bucks get shot countries reporting far less impressive numbers though?

It’s pretty high percentage country doesn’t want get vaccinated. going do? national guard going hit streets hold people give shots?

Alberta eh? Unfortunately it’s green light anti vaxers sucks us employees especially since we’re required wear starting Saturday… Pray 😭 long affect children significantly more, say gives fuck. Let unvaccinated die. 

They're saying vaccinated people getting hospitalized dieing Covid now. things listed? one asking except masks. call selfish yet put simple face covering on. shows clearly know immunocompromised people. know many. lives completely turned upsidedown. work jobs work home. small businesses, work warehouses, retail, one surgeon! can't marginalize entire population matter small. easy solution: Mandate vaccines. get upset good parking spots reserved handicapped? Big government telling people run business? I'm confused. ""extremely tiny chance significantly harmful side effects vaccine"" vs. ""extremely high chance protected virus that's killed millions people across planet""? acknowledge fact vaccines work vaccinated people still spread virus. 

People seem forgetting initially idea vaccines would cut transmission *at all*. goal vaccines never stop people getting infected, cut serious illness death. Roll Tide! drink drive too? link shows cases exploding. Mandate vaccine, fuck feelings. Delta's R0 ten. 

That mean anything*. First, recognize zero Covid probably impossible, that's often meant trying clash every possible chance virus transmit. Allowing transmission trying keep R 1 *easier* stops virus anyway eventually. 

R0 tells us far virus spread, let's remember population immunity, vaccines, masks, guidance reduce prevent aerosol transmission indoor, quarantine positives, use tracing apps, etc.. mystery least *try* reduce spread fronts till virus mostly dies itself. alternatives lockdowns many, least borrow time either even better vaccines adapted variants, hopefully treatments gets infected ill, even ICU get capacity. risking building burden disabilities future apparently acting reasonability unbearable, everyday I'm like: ""seriously?"", get people's frustration pandemic, think that's healthiest way cope it

Uhm, no, ""universal masking that's it"" ""what asking for"". quoting kind policy recommendation modelling assumption probability model presented slides 20 21. say masking non-pharmaceutical intervention they've included model.  

A slides later, ""Next steps CDC Prevention"", first says ""Universal masking source control prevention"" *""Reconsider community mitigation strategies""* (my emphasis), way like NPIs table. pandemic started said usually takes 2 years ""end"" saying end 2 years too. thought thats absurd thats damn long. feel like 2 years even achievable I'd happy end 2 years thats unlikely now. Yeah anything shows need vaccine protect since apparently protect around well. thought meant Georgia country lol Hell yeah brother No. slide article referencing differentiate infections hospitalization effectiveness. 70-85 percent effective infection 90 percent hospitalization feel like we're talking past let reframe core point. Consider following scenario:

There's small, unventilated room 50 people it, confirmed covid 19. They're coughing talking generally socializing. I'm going walk room stay 2 hours.

* wear full P100 face mask + respirator (the kind might use mold remediation), barring equipment failure, probably contract covid 19.
* wear N95 good fit, might get covid 19. There's reasonable chance I'll escape unscathed far safe bet.
* wear cloth mask, likely contract covid.
* wear nothing, would almost certainly contract covid.

Now let's change scenario imagine everyone room, including me, wearing cloth mask. There's decent chance I'll escape without catching covid everyone's mask controlling emission cloud, preventing droplets collecting room.

I feel like sources referring second scenario: effectiveness cloth masks control emission cloud. I'm talking first scenario post-mask-mandate world unvaccinated folks running around without masks, that's scenario exist in. question feel left unanswered is: scenario completely uncontrolled emission clouds -- fact breathing air tainted manner particles -- effective cloth masks stopping particles getting lungs?  Killing grandma part God's plan get family pray more. /s Knock feather someone highly recommend following! worked vaccines level-headed comforting throughout whole thing! still 52% ONE shot. Ridiculous. fully vaccinated person got breakthrough case covid, would act like booster shot? never wanted tp believe idiots would ruin vaccine everyone. believe it.  Hm, that’s good actually. Tax Chriiiiiiistian burdens society.  Alabama lowest fully vaxxed. Mississippi lowest first doses. get new information, adapt it. Good idea used earned PTO one day.... It’s funny agree here. arguing side debating you. yes, data suggest delta deadly alpha strains even back then. apostrophe anything! Evolution don’t care. Evolution keep keepin matter 7 pounds nerves ears does. Finally dumb fucks number one something  based assumption transmission needs reduced begin with. doesn't. Deaths hospitalizations need reduced, that's vaccine does. give flying fuck get Covid sniffly nose. Good point. unvaccinated children fairing? Delta seem hitting harder? Except I'm replying comment.


Not CDC. stole this. Thank you. Yes, one dose effective preventing symptomatic disease. That's true, question that.

[One dose quite strong hospitalization That's going coming soon. recent data Israel bad ignore. good news there's reason optimistic making less terrible matter constant boosters simplifies supply chains greatly, bad news stretch say means probably going need booster least year. There’s distinction symptomatic infection infection Antiva.  deaths.... Time guardianship &amp; make sure she'll voting Democrat on. 'cause that's Jesus would do. 

These people idiots. hope everyone shows mask shut down. believe effectiveness related severity keeping people hospitals, dealing easy spreads.  Athletes still getting infected. even bother read original comment?? say refuse wear face covering say vaccines mandated?? said ridiculous ask fully vaccinated people get tested everytime suspected exposure.

Yes admit know many immunocompromised people ones job. Maybe I'm anti social maybe that's they're small part population. 

As example handicapped spots, guess reserved spots? local government, ""program"" help people without causing major inconvenience others. chosen ignore second comment government's responsibility people help vulnerable. Getting vaccine wearing mask necessary enough general population.
The approach covid akin saying every parking spot handicapped spot everybody compromise few. 

Also flu season remark meant point get seasonal flu vaccine lower severity infection thing gets is...basically every politician every major party saying get it. Biden says get it, Trump says get it, Schumer says get it, McConnell says get it, etc etc etc.

So resistance? thought Trump people's ""God Emperor"". used look back history look stupid thing believed in. look time line No, isn’t. None news said that. Literally zero.

What saying new data suggests vaccinated individuals spread comparable degree unvaccinated. spreadneck name already claimed fans Widespread Panic. put evil them. someone works medical field nursing facilities severely understaffed nurses want get vaccine.   vaccinated, likely okay even get it. Everyone dies eventually. point find joy long regardless Death Day. Everything I've heard indicates mid-fall approval 5-12 age group, winter 2-5, early 2022 kids 2.

Can’t tell you’re genuinely confused trolling Disneyland 6/2 6/3 masked entire time. fine, honestly, essential worker masked 8 hours day year half now. sure dealbreaker many people especially indoors. Yes, order transmit it, people actually become infected. vaccine provides high level protection becoming infected. 

For reason, vast majority transmission comes unvaccinated individuals. Yup.  updates mixing vaccines ? Specifically would like know it’s safe take Pfizer taking two doses sinopharm. Ah ad hom, mhm. comment history anything said here. Feel free point ""yikes"" things comment history, since much time hands invested this. wasn’t South got vaccine big box store asked insurance ID. partner got city vaccination center didn’t ask either. really think attention paid toward get undocumented immigrants vaccinated. guess rates extremely low population unvaccinated people risk public health. Even got slightly inferior vaccine versus delta, data still shows way many vaccinated breakthrough infections. Yeah, I’ll admit didn’t think we’d see (and clear, CDC isn’t recommending additional measures beyond masking time), think new data, it’s bit likely.

I ate indoors restaurant couple days ago. Wouldn’t now, least Delta wave passes through. think 5-9 write will, etc?  Actually is... normally that's good thing basis employment law, consumer protection, etc.

In case though...  Jesus, think 1 5 people Covid Good. know first thing get drafted? vaccinate every communicable disease get sent boot camp fun month, I’m sure still wonder UK saw case numbers drop rather skyrocket. reckoned with. pretty obvious need Elvis get covid vaccine. Oh well… anyways! point, hope culling bag genes lasting effects. sympathy plague enthusiasts anymore.

That textbook hypocrisy. Main steam news worst, sides. divide us. guess people would rather risk

The thing is, risks wildly different picking one vs. hard.

It's like preferring risk standing middle freeway, vs. risk getting struck lighting. follow county's health department social media post stats fully vaccinated people, new cases, etc. fully vaccinated percentage going increments 0.1% every days, we're something like 56.3%. rate might around 62% - still high enough - early 2022. painful see. rate could even slow down, really many hard-headed anti-vaxers. hand, kids 12 get vaccinated might pick somewhat demographic. Yeah, even non Covid, it’s bad enough ventilator, odds 50/50 best. Covid ventilator means you’re damn lucky survive, likely serious long term health issues result. 

And agreed, wish others weren’t arrogant pricks advise others equally stupid. Grew Alabama. Saban saying get actively make people Aubrun fans get vax. Sports important religion there. Thanks. I've saying along (at bare minimum reasons get COVID)....I love food want give tasting it! Wating Alabama virus.... shitshow best thing Tater Tot family caught COVID (I want say kids) he's complete dumbass. pedantic, surprising sense vaccine designed neutralize alpha beta variants, either. So, presumably, would offer substantial protection delta well (which does, though clearly previous variants original virus). long time, window delta India, horrifying, also occurring among population nearly entirely unvaccinated. So, really didn’t science delta justify sustaining previous caution, proof vaccine protected remarkably well known major variants concern, time. 

Of course, many prudent people continued socially distance wear masks, perhaps hadn’t forgotten Covid-19 constant development unknowns upon unknowns, transmission symptoms long-term effects. wish one people. But, missed life. sit extremely worried exposed complete abandon past week. Garbage state. good leadership and, thankfully, large Native American population, got vaccinated remarkably high numbers. vaccines 85 percent effective infection reduce transmission default…all saying people breakthrough infections contagious, makes perfect sense. Maybe one two people know could persuaded

NM I’ve quite surprised majority people suburban areas on-board covid precautions. never fight masks vaccines many us Tell understand medical field without telling understand medical field. That's good all. Nurses tell patient beforehand chance may never wake up. imagine hearing words. actively removing sick, depraved tyrannical society. Becoming self reliant networking, watch see society burn ground  sad well would work, especially gave spares Mexico Health insurance absolutely charges smokers more. LOT important distinction. kids everyone cared much last year ""suffering"" virtual learning inadvertently going left sick, disabled dead adults selfish.  think CDC moving slow this, like originally masks.

The article states virus ""as contagious chicken pox,"" have, ""studies showing vaccinated individuals infected delta may able transmit virus easily unvaccinated."" means new virus could spread though vaccinated population easily unvaccinated population.

I think mindset preventing severe disease death. that's possible achieve, it. However, problem even someone need hospitalization, sometimes get sick may long-term effects disease. **Therefore, goal, never get Covid all**. seems readily achievable today booster shot. would almost certainly work even better delta-specific booster.

I think need start approving variant-specific boosters keep changing virus. happy current level protection? Fine, get it. However, option people want it.

In meantime, N95 masks readily available wearing whenever I'm indoors people. It’s losing perspective. Things changed. Good 75-85 percenters good outcomes. data saying referring breakthrough cases “rare” may statistically true misleading reason small percentage (breakthroughs) really big number (the vaxxed) still significant number, especially small percentage.

So prove it. Wasn’t Israeli study suggesting Pfizer effectiveness stopping severe infection vaccinated persons drops around 80%? I’ve seeing sub virologists follow Twitter.

Granted, also heard reasons skeptical study’s findings.

For record, UK AZ shots. “Pro-life”   went Greece hundreds thousands people saw metro, saw less ~40 people wearing masks incorrectly (only one totally wearing mask) weekend youth out. Everyone masking indoors. Kinda wanted stay. moving target. first, 1 200, people vaccinated, were, long. couple weeks ago, state (WA) hit 6.7% breakthroughs (1/13.1), weekly report yesterday, 12% (1/8.35). Seattle area (King county) 14% little that. 100% vaccinated population, may cases, 100% breakthroughs, lot increase we're lot vaxxed now. Anyway, expect 1/17 last. tied MS far least full vaccinations. Though higher percentage Alabamians one shot Louisiana, Wyoming, Idaho, and... Mississippi, probably makes least vaccinated state. Well first diabetes heart disease. Better yet, make federal offense forge them. fucking hate state Yup Exactly thinking valid excuse. 

The Olympic Games implicitly penalize countries lack resources. Ever notice shocking lack athletes India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh? 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th populous nations planet representing 2 billion people, yet one top 20 countries terms medals. New Zealand 3x medals combined 0.2% population.

The reason populous countries poor lack resources. Requiring vaccination less onerous requiring ability pay airfare accommodations, let alone facilities train. also potentially save lives. Darwinism! sent article recent University Tennessee pharmacy school grad still unvaccinated. Dude trying get hospital pharmacist job, can’t bothered get jab himself? cognitive dissonance deep.

These company-wide policies though. I’m DC there’s word yet there’s going different plan us, could be. there's process involved that, rushing since actual EUA already place. Supposedly Pfizer's soon ( Aug-Sep ) Moderna month after.

Don't read anything it. canada countries US country Get tiny bit sick shot twice, know get better. maybe get mildly sick delta.

Or risk permanent damage, months fatigue, terrible illness. 

I'm surprised people bad assessing risk. Sooo...bleach wawa behind hole? hugely relevant: ADJUSTMENTS INTERVENTIONS. e.g., distancing, isolation, gathering restrictions, etc.

So they're asking universal masking people catch naturally people get vaccinated, that's it. Masks wave over, and/or vaccines mandated employers full FDA approval, and/or kids get vaccinated. masking winter, worst case.

Get vaccine, wear mask, live life. That's unreasonable.  chances already insanely low hospitalized I’m saying Age group

And vaccinated people still spread it, delta insanely contagious, didn’t willingly feel super crappy 2 day’s reason? seeing lockdowns? Ah yes, **selflessness**, tried true American virtue. vaccine drastically reduced chances getting sick

Even get sick again, vaccine drastically improved odds sick thing is, getting vaccinated choice effects you. unvaccinated person, potentially spreading virus helping cause mutations (like delta variant) direct effect vaccinated people like me. vaccine effective, want put risk people like still spreading rapidly-mutating virus. reason get vaccine, stop selfish help stop spread COVID. It’s Cape Cod probably skews older among first vaccinated. confirm boosters needed sooner many thought Delta. politicians. Okey dokey. That's simply true though lol, that's ridiculous. We're 95% less likely get infected, 97% less likely hospitalized, 99% less likely die hospitalized, yet *may* infectious. Yeah, *may* live flat earth. sensational stuff like makes people distrust actual journalism. know mean. nostalgic smell me. Takes back days kid playing outside summer long evenings catching distant scent skunk. article talking COVID making resurgence much dangerous form even seems lower vaccine efficacy comes infections possibly severe disease (not deaths currently). article says COVID infections severity may lead cognitive issues. saying may make beyond novel virus reminding us novel. points B C largely debunked. correct. Australia reported exposures fleeting, we’re talking seconds. Someone Covid infectious simply needs breath near without mask you’re protected N95 equivalent could likely receive infectious dose. many viral particles shed variant. It’s infectious measles.

Yeah. unvaccinated people. That's enforcement then. Lmfao. work. work tremendously matter fact. big concern right apparently comes delta variant, vaccine protects hospitalization death opposed actually stopping case happening. false profit blood hands. calls shepherd Lord, yet leads flock straight flames.

Versus confirmed Delta infections we're seeing -96% hospitalisation UK (mix AZ Pfizer, albeit typically 8-12 weeks doses). Agreed. lived non-touristy side Orlando month ago. Everyone rather conscious protocol no-mask-if-youre-vaccinated announcement. expected, towns major university seem compliant. living Daytona Beach, boy oh boy different story here. party states rights personal freedoms long strictly follow guidelines ideals. guess clear clarifying sane people ones crying microchips, equivalency understood comment. getting vaccinations, way less likely severe symptoms. So, may get sick infected Delta variant, far less likely require hospitalization. makes point

I make counter-point

you derail moving goalpost fallacy

OMG GASLIGHTING HALP irony live Georgia went Alabama get vaccinated since begging people come get GA open age group yet. left site walking behind couple walked got car Washington plates. sure country speak of, really thing, mandatory vaccine. least Canada USA. believe applies U.K.
Although obvious Vaccines proving worth taken eligible. cannot forced upon individual. That's simple truth.
There exemptions. exempted religious reason, medical reasons reason consciousness. saying good thing. I'm saying.
So, I'm afraid say, literally never gonna case 100 percent vaccination countries. always pockets ppl using one exemptions get vaccine wish avoid.
Some might say that's luxury living ""free country"" (a) oh, okay

(b) yes, delta change this. Preliminary result study Israel suggest so. Breakthrough cases higher other, common variants. Heck, see cases high community. increase breakthrough cases. - long better number many breakthrough cases really die hospitalized, err side caution. delta variant spike starting. 1,000 change. say fearmongering ... yeah, well, again, err side caution.

(c) Yes, (1) delta change that. (2) kids school instead online change this. studies done kids last 1 1/2 years obsolete. already see higher hospitalization numbers kids get even higher, ignore still going pandemic. fallacy compare COVID flu anyway. Also, vaccinate kid flu yearly. cannot yet COVID, sadly. kids done lot take care older population dial back live. vaccinated, think older ones courtesy adult careful little longer. That’s true. olympic standard field competitions actually lower (easier) US standard. US standard American athletes need reach order sent compete Olympics behalf US

so makes sense replacement way big fan mask mandate removal unenforceability (who vaccinated isn't?), surprising, least unfair predict public health policy worst case hypothetical scenarios. 

Admittedly Delta exist time rule changed, research sparse. still novel even India time. Early antibody studies showed less evasiveness Beta, Pfizer tolerated relatively well, assumption big problem. 

We're running three simultaneous problems: 

* Delta moderately vaccine evasive (but hugely) 
* Research (unsurprisingly) showing neutralizing antibody levels decline time breakthrough infection (not severe disease) likely 
* Delta appears effective creating viral load right places spread (hence higher R0 level) irrespective vaccination status 

Any three things break chain: one two case, people still get infected. three case, vaccinated people big source spread. 

The FDA authorizing booster would solve problem (1) (2) - least another 4-6 months. / limited infection, chance become spreader. ten 20 years? Indian government* thanks. can't blame entire country's people power procure vaccines need. worst thing pandemic finding much people act like they're gleeful hurting killing people. There's freedom infecting people deadly virus, that's pointless cruelty. dadgum ""The vaccine doens't protect getting covid, lessen symptoms"" WELL THATS FUCKING REASON GET FUCKING SHOT, RIGHT?!  


Sorry yelling today, I'm frustrated anti-vaxxers making covid situation worse, I'm done. mask mandates might thing again.

Only places like California New York.  They're never coming back Florida, Alabama, Texas. test virus. don’t need severe disease get long covid. I’d rather wife lose jobs and/or long-term disabilities. think wake call some. enough likely.

Fuckin' idiots. No, 3% hospitalized. still overwhelmingly unvaccinated people, obviously. 1000 ""pretty much none"" hospitalizations, parent commentor getting at. He/she implying numbers close zero. I'm saying close zero still &lt;4% hospitalizations. I’m thinking going third.  say funny.

I get they're saying, point reality situation think ""sane people"" actually end rarely tend fall line anymore.

I agree people already got vaccinated MAY wait compensation future event, fact still large number people think whole scam put tracking device proves hope reliable crutch anymore. christian original objective stop slow transmission, reduce serious illness. death. Honestly, much lower could really go? briefing corporate executives hold donation purse springs got. threatened GOP politicians pulling donations push vaccination efforts.

With mid terms coming Trump siphoning money election disputes GOP desperately needs money campaigning 2023 want attempt get majority somewhere. mention GOP voters vulnerable latest strains winningly stuck information echo chamber tells believe experts. That’s established tendency. thing established virus become transmissible evolutionary pressure. Everything else gravy it.  in: Anti-vaxxers much likely premature ejaculators. spreads one place never go to! in: Anti-vaxxers much likely premature ejaculators. Article says 94%, huge sample size. 271 total COVID patients surveyed ICUs, 255 patients, approximately 94%, unvaccinated COVID-19 ABC News' snapshot time. LOL PERMANENT bahahahahahahhaha ""Don't blame virus"" force nature, ""it do,"" ""blame"" grizzly bear behaving like grizzly bear, etc. depends people getting vaccinated taking sensible precautions area case surges. Probably best thing young person convince people age get vaccinated. let boomers outdo generation vaccinations? You’re supposed better them, right? Funny tone changed ""STAY FUCK HOME"" ""FUCK I'M GONNA LIVE LIFE!"" You’re entitled opinion, there’s much double standard going on. want think everyone deserves loans paid off, can’t mad people waited get vaccine compensated. people work ass live well means pay student loans, others wait may/may forgiven specific policies put place. 

Likewise, people say “you’re forced vaccine - quit job!” people claim underpaid people choice stay, can’t leave, forced take lower wage, that’s government needs enforce living wage instead free market work. Doesn’t work like that, it?

What said “hey, perform act makes uncomfortable want keep job”? would sound? guys would coming woodwork droves saying “wahh terrible person forced employee terrible thing didn’t want do?” See ridiculous is? Yeah, us vaxxed still wear masks public children 12 years old cannot get it. wear mask public trust scummy people would lie vaxxed. 

I go work toss people think wearing mask.  so? asking. Breakthroughs happen you’re less likely get really sick them. tolerate sore throat congestion much better vent.  CDC saying there's 0 difference delta breakthrough infection, peer reviewed yet, interpretation raw data see. There's money made see eventually. Provincetown, health officials operating assumption extraordinarily rare vaccinated person become infected virus. did, probably end passing others, children young qualify vaccine people medically idea vaccines halt transmission virus largely behind CDC's decision May suggesting vaccinated people could safely go without masks indoors crowds, even others unvaccinated.

Until Cape Cod Beach outbreak, CDC believed vaccines massively reduced transmission (which early Israeli data agreed believe) Mine too.  15 min whole day? mean even walk street day, would 15 min passing people by.

Come on, get vaccinated, hard understand, get vaccinated. Stop disingenuous. item.

This life-saving preventative measure. saying really put health risk alienated sane civilization chance $50-100?

Additionally, value vaccination April/May beyond health benefits. Major sporting events venues available via proof vaccination, giving vaccine intangible value. hope lockdowns. starting feel normal *everyone 12 older  believe reason allowed avoid penalizing Olympians countries access vaccines limited nonexistent.

That said, International Olympic Committee absolutely providing vaccines competitors, regardless country origin. problem countries access, create equity allowing anybody come without vaccine. created providing vaccine everyone.

Such clusterfuck. Missing context federal government borrowed spent around 20% annual GDP get us back baseline. Bro, tripping whole time, I'm taking chances. missed every stimulus check well. Never mind working first quarter year due COVID. hey - year banner year…never mind peoples current situation.

I’m done right thing watching everyone else get money thrown them.

But mind, look Reddit front page maybe month - idea what's mind cute pet, meme economy cryptoscam communities. I've doubt they're lot worse science &amp; environment subs dominate sub lists. many disabled kids think okay number?  I’m willing live knowledge disabled killed someone hang Applebee’s.
But think going maskless hanging Applebee’s worth low risk, you.  It’s America that’s freedom.   really ridiculous point. vaccines super effective disease variants far people sub acting like suddenly lost efficacy doomed. Companies function working home (I.e every fucking office less) duty help stop delta tracks continuing work home policies. I've started shitting nearby bush, dare track movements! I’m sure “battle” isn’t over… people envision saving America hero. fantasize able destroy obliterate. 

Yet idea building, caretaking showing compassion follow vision. Move western NY-Buffalo! Low cost living Small government? Hypocrites.

How hell right tell businesses can't enforce basically dress code public safety? kid 3 getting shot soon it’s approved. 

I’ve already pulled soccer. wish could also pull preschool can’t work. least school required masks amazing health safety protocols. 

We going go outdoor event birthday weeks we’ll probably cancelling too. It’s fair I’d like make next birthday. Unfortunately, aren’t even ones placed make decision… want vaccines mandatory protect idiots themselves. I've done that. actually best waves hurricane actually hit. Nice! town something like 85% vaccinated. sample self-selected people went get covid testing, biases data towards breakthrough infections. know absolutely nothing rate breakthrough infection data randomized. 

Look base rate fallacy.

In short - data collection wildly biased numerous studies delta variant better designed. inexplicable CDC using poorly designed study craft policy.  see employers coming weeks. spread vaccinated well Weekly Florida Covid report 07/23/2021-7/29/2021

\- outbreak scary death rate *(are really dying.......)*  nah *(too many cases / deaths)* \- chile/uk  

\- really going icus  nah *(they vaccinated - soft cases)* b/c political economic devastation another lockdown hurt/kill lot people  You’re well way! don’t know like it. wanna see many downvotes get. Negative 6 minute. example OP's statement wrong. clearly wrong statement currently worded. Bound happen people generalize though suppose. seeing kids Delta variant? know generally speaking, least OG virus, children showing many symptoms thankfully fatal adults. Delta variant similar way? 

unrelated, Bobby's ass taste? I've always wondered... think perfect world everyone agreed vaccinated would true. unfortunate truth places vaccination rates incredibly low putting everyone risk including vaccine. Sure risk low vaccinated still risk. sad places Canada vaccination rates high (80% first dose 65%-70% second dose) see hospitalization rates dropping dramatically total cases well. Florida 66 new cases per 100k people. California 20 new cases per 100k. California could get Florida levels probably since better vaccinated least attempting take precautions. Christian camp apparently.


I remember reading summer camps open 2020. Deniers acted like cases proof schools would safe.


Turns examples gave went extreme measures keep kids locked small groups whole summer. interaction kids outside groups. today, tomorrow, 8 kids summer camp buddies whole summer. masks. many activities required kids get hand stamp, complete first activity, wash hand stamp. move first stamp washed off. would get next stamp, could start next activity. Utah too😠  It's. Happening. close 70%! great news! J&amp;J: actually don’t much data J&amp;J delta right now. However say recently havent found anyone yet died covid got J&amp;J. Im sure happened data hasnt released yet seem think vaccine holding quite well. data stating 33% 90% Delta jury still effective J&amp;J delta long run. Anecdotally caught covid fully vaccinated J&amp;J back late april, got vaccine mid march. line thinking led Holocaust numerous atrocities. Comparing end July end April seems...weird. Like supposed infer 10x number? right decision. fictional power anime compels target commanded. Sorry, weeb speech kinda snuck there. NY heavily vaccinated expect see something like UK That's par course, article says they're offering $150 store warehouse workers get fully vaccinated. many words! Ah! 300 dying everyday, that’ll take 1500 years kill off. evidence effectiveness desperation 3rd world get them. 

Actions consequences Tell it... we, point, get clear numbers every day (I'll settle every week) number breakthrough infections lead hospitalization versus total number vaccinated? think merit tracking number (maybe vacuum like CDC been, would paid attention to) wish could see updated daily. I'm holding breath we'll get granular data CDC fire recommending every American get tested constantly they've around someone COVID (which, let's face it, leave house live Vermont, probably multiple times per day). 

Right now, can't really focus COVID positive cases I'll go insane. are, mean look around sub. 

It would far useful know two things state country 1) many breakthrough infections lead hospitalization? 2) many children 12 hospitalized infection? 

Also, plotting children 12 infections graph starting April 2020 would wonderfully helpful. 

(I expect happen anytime soon.) new data spread Delta among vaccinated, case symptomatic breakthrough infections? asymptomatic breakthrough infections also spread? fewer people back though. 

as percentage population, 3% world died WW2, far cry COVID .05%. define ""long covid"" actually is? husband got sick tested positive exposed never got sick tested positive. Moderna double vaxxed read PBS clear up, never meant mean reflect personal opinion. sarcastic scenarios could used

At end said hope none happens  though? isn’t particularly helpful comment something like without additional information. towns relentlessly backward. 

Walmart announced employees required mask. Hopefully Hutchinson follow along like last time. I'm boat. think we're expected back (at least 3days/wk) beginning September. know what's going happen. still talk returning. discussion changing plans. month ago, daily COVID cases area 70 (0.9% positivity rate) we're 700 (8-9% positivity rate). Ugh.  Vaccines binary. Sometimes work well enough keep gates up. breakthrough, defenses primed deal it. occasion take Imagine broadcasting world thinking you’re sort genius Last time Provincetown almost knocked man wearing fairy wings covered green glitter, screaming angrily phone Portuguese.

I can't wait go back. Israel still going month national mask mandate higher percentage vaccinated US.

Chile essentially lived near ATH 120 days things finally came recently.

And annoying India, everyone knows cases undercounted, ""miracle"" dip still much higher cases before. 

So we're throwing away bogus notions reinfections breakthroughs rare question seen anyone try answer medical science viewpoint:

Is getting Covid cumulatively worse every time person does?

The stories far 'my family mild case go vaccines'. Great. 

What's thinking happens family outbreak gets mild cases again? want feel bad people. really do. can’t bring find much sympathy though. 



It exists. It’s spreading. Again. reasoning I’ve heard people around laughable. changes DNA. Bill Gates gets mind control. released emergency “officially”approved it’s 100 years type shit. Facebook, local/state politicians source science. 



Your wife’s uncles nephews stepsons granddaddy’s friend died probably wasn’t misfiled COVID extra 75k funding. 



How fuck become acceptable reasoning? Fauci said couple days ago viral load vaxxed unvaxxed. 

In state vaxxed wear masks public unvaxxed do. one would assume would viral spreader store? go option.

Needed camping cot replace old one son outgrew. Bass Pro, Cabela's, Dick's, Scheel's sold out. 

Fuck. FUCK. FUUUUUCK. dramatic, protesting outside schools pre-covid demanding mandate flu vaccine? Like 10 people live ND. NJ ranked like 38 daily new cases per capita I'm sure talking about. love Bayesian statistics. Sadly articles report p(vaccination|hospitalized) make people think number actually p(hospitalized|vaccination), even think that, first number hard interpret without p(vaccination).  Reportedly quite doses expire US immediate intention exported low-income countries. I'd rather used wasted. think specifying pertains delta variant rather important context Wth geass? Yeah I'm getting vaccine “research wait see” talk sounds like kid saying “I’m GOING clean room/brush teeth/take bath!!!” found day Bezos bought Washington Post 2013. article first I've seen questioning efficacy vaccines. Brought news agency owned man wealth gain stay inside afraid order everything online. number countries even mixed vaccines get Pfizer first Moderna second, example. Pfizer Moderna offer lot protection vaccines, I’d like see program get guys dose good stuff.

Admittedly, J&amp;J didn’t seem like bad idea time. It’s Delta really messed things up. apologize. takeaway?

This study based people sought COVID testing.

By definition biasing sample towards people breakthrough infections.

We cannot take ANYTHING rate breakthrough away study. way make conclusions randomized testing. So, couple family.  Honestly think Delta made landfall pre-vaccine times there's good chance US would completely collapsed. going wild wild winter among unvaccinated. Ben Shapiro, Sean Hannity, Mitch McConnell, Steve Scalise, extent Donald Trump made marked rhetorical shifts past week regarding vaccines. Shapiro example revealed fact vaccinated. Don’t feel like finding links right able find examples googling names. fact came around time led speculate gop “marching orders” may come I'm waiting someone make graph linking education rate covid infection rate...  Feeling dread last fall. supposed over. Got mine worried cannot Hmmm time really? say let's take another 18vmonths find presentation? Overwhelming ignorance, deliberate look schools huge drop rates, barely afford books. Basically anyone rich huge disadvantage. Critical thinking become privatized sold premium. got vaxxed state site asked ID. back reservation system though probably check really said were. .... idea people get long Covid infections, even asymptomatic infections. need data like needed data whether vaccinated transmit - seeing can. Plus huge amounts people cannot get vaccinated -- children others vulnerable -- real issue common cold. Plus Delta hugely transmissible. Here's people getting vaccinated can. people need mask up. """"The agency’s data suggest people weak immune systems wear masks even places high transmission virus. vaccinated Americans contact young children, older adults, otherwise vulnerable people."""" Starting hunker socially distance again. need start staying home even vaccinated stop spread. I've returned masking staying home cancelling gatherings. Think vaccine efficacy like entering lottery. 5% chance infection *per exposure* 

The lottery tickets buy chance winning. People went back normal life regular contact tons people buying lots chances winning. Basic probability. remember 85 preexisting conditions maybe avoid cruise year. Congratulations 'Bama y'all finally beat Mississippi. bottom. Roll Tide! Yup. experts agencies deliver information public consider possibly definitively false larger, often well-meaning agenda, telling called noble lie. Although teller’s intentions may pure—for example, feeling urgency behavioral change needed among lay public—the consequences undermine intentions also public trust experts science. first year COVID-19, leaders faced unknown disease amid politically sensitive election era social media, preconditions noble lies became especially fertile. 

This article makes lot points made past Fauci's behavior. opinion, response right's reaction him, left made immune criticism. 

I hope people able read avoid knee jerk defenses Facui instead focus larger point. hell unvaccinated people get take priority procedures?? point care something elective nose job; unvaccinated need go back last line. Think vaccine efficacy like entering lottery. 5% chance infection *per exposure*

Flu vaccines similarly don’t prevent flu infections, seem lower risk severe disease. Alabama finally first something! That's usually bomb threat. Would think ""drive status"" would appropriate. situation vaxxed since March (essential worker) wife biting nails young children vaccine approved daughter start preschool. Meanwhile boss like ""I'm vaccinated wear mask ain't gonna get covid me!"" feels worse year ago least could tell people left right put fucking mask glee. report suggests vaccines even matter much without tests since vaccinated people still transmit easily. viral load overwhelms vaccines easily.

Covid's over. We're over. Why? vaccinated people high risk others allowed make choices bodies? whole world going vaccinated, virus going away. It’s helping situation, would agree? allowing untold thousands unvaccinated migrants country helping vaccination program? Let dumbasses die. medical care given non vaccinated people. need booster shot 5-6 month intervals. unvaccinated people ok sorry accurate, whole population exposed once. would vote this? true.

Why one paying attention That’s right. cat would never this. high quality accurate information. CNN propaganda machine better bot. tell truth? mandatory vaccination thousands unvaccinated, unemployed foreign nationals enter country illegally day? Well, 2k new cases day, 1 5 vaccinated person, schools starting going make spike worse. Yep. companies straight ban smokers due premiums. Reynolds Reynolds example absolutely *not* consider smoker happily terminate pop nicotine drug test. shit. lol. know 3 people already fully vaxed got covid w symptoms. think many people getting tested it. riding it’s minor Looks like document article refers PowerPoint slide CDC. Looks like masks coming back foreseeable future *sigh* aren’t vaccinated, get vaccinated. 

This biggest public health crisis 21st century…

Until next one. Fr defining phrase Alabama ""at least we're Mississippi"" applies nearly every statistical state ranking find.

Oh wait, nvm logic applies side agree with. Get vaccinated move on.  actual fuck. ""Attest?"" Believe there's whole process administering documenting vaccinations military.

Hell, half lie medical condition get military first place. Moderna 3.3x stronger? That’s insane. idea horribly reporting issues well.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  this? Incompetence intent? switch weird? Russia doesn’t soft power well.   1.) That's true. vaccines almost 100% effective stopping virus, meaning end hospital. Thats fact. 

2.) Two doses effective stopping getting covid (note 1)

Now reading #2 conflicting research. UK showed delta would stop virus infecting you, meaning could asymptomatic spread virus. Research Canada shows exact opposite, vaccines effective. 

Some studies shows Moderna might last longer (over year) focus much those. 

Also taking **A vaccin** 1000% better taking **0 vaccine**. Take one available live make sure take second dose. also studies UK says 8 weeks sweet spot I've seen anything 5 12 weeks. USA. Hopefully we’ll able grab additional shots want soon Ireland sort supports countries data though. Yep. mom says I’m ‘super gay’! ‘regular gay’ got shots. That’s gotta atleast twofold increase.  first test long ago, highly unpleasant. sinus infection. paracetamol viagra probably clue end-manufacturer is.

Uh... yes do? says right box. 

Also buy unbranded meds anyway. Paying brand molecule exactly manufacturers stupid. sub, last month so, turned hivemind essentially vaccine making immune. People caught covid double jabbed called liars. Suggestion covid could still result death double vaxxed person called misinformation.

So news comes America people saying true, they've collectively lost kinds. might success developing promoting narrative anti vax messages deep State propaganda designed eliminate true Patriots

Only partially /s, longtime parent obstinate child basing of? dont worry plenty extra judging heartland's rate vaccination. shocked face ask Doc Covid antibody test. single blood draw tube.  would shamed it, competitors street so. Keep eye hospitalization, NYC high vax+infection rate, maybe closer herd immunity anywhere else country. biggest irony people think Covid conspiracy ones actively choosing extend long possible.  ERROR, INCORRECT ANSWER CDC mishandled mask mandate retreated several months back.

Delta already ravaging India, CDC, removed mask mandate, administration, whole, sent loud signal USA back ""normal"", that's ""mission accomplished"" type fantasy. overly dramatic doesn’t help anyone are. 

Vaccines still highly effective, even Delta. make statements odds really, really bad simply true. people get vaccinated? Yes, absolutely you’re making sound like without vaccines gonna hospitalized die get covid that’s absolutely case. 

Florida’s hospital system nearing collapse? Again, stop overly dramatic.

Nah I'm done that. wondering. Obviously Delta spreads easily cause lot people get sick raw numbers basis, see data aligns dangerous individual level. strange. headline seems intentionally misleading. graph article shows cases, hospital stays death rate race. White skin color second cases third hospital stays/death date. Love article waits way second last paragraph state: “Still, C.D.C.’s figures show vaccines highly effective preventing serious illness, hospitalization death vaccinated people, experts said.”

I’m tired news media organizations using scare tactics. again, vaccinated - FINE. unvacc’d - that’s you. Take whatever vaccine get. 
Practice safe interactions including masking good mask limiting social bubble. 
Otherwise prepared likely get infected statistics side. 

Like many others saying, way full vaccination everyone. 
Best case: everyone earth. 
Worst case: everyone immediate community. 
Obviously one much likely succeed multitude reasons. Yes. But, strong. thing care death, still excellent. Hospitalization, still way better odds unvaccinated. Transmission moderate illness showing signs erosion.

The thing worries personally always brain damage we've time fully understand. recent studies seen imply causally connected severe respiratory issues. worse worse cases, affects people hospitalized. knowledge worker,I want know effective vaccine preventing cognitive damage.

I'm choosing cautious Shingles sends thanks them. getting lot votes, everything saying CDC counting hospitalizations breakthrough cases accurate. listed website.

CDC also admitted vaccinated people spreading Delta variant. scientific evidence enough mask guidance changed three days ago. Fully vaccinated people advised wear masks indoors.  ‘Where Ron DeSantis Go Get   even US. Mexico! Sucks suuuuuuuck  Schools cannot require masks either. School starts August 12. It’s like slow motion pileup know crash, sure bad it’ll be. Pfizer Moderna completed trials dosage kids.

Facebook poison No, meant step line blundering public health approach countries bullying messaging. Yes, true vaccines still highly effective hospitalization/death, thank goodness. plenty people saying vaccines also effective stopping spread (see pinned ""Vaccines work safe"" post), true delta. also saying breakthrough infections rare looks like rare. *Breakthrough severe disease* rare. 

But anytime mentioned that, people would yelled ""stop anti-vaccine"" anti-vaccine. acknowledge vaccines highly effective preventing hospitalization death, still acknowledging vaccinated people get infected spread it. mutually exclusive looks like ""I believe science"" people interested science extols good vaccine news. Rebekah Jones nothing wrong 80% eligible people (Over 16s)

Those eligible ~80% total population

So 0.8 * 0.8 * 25.36m = 16.23m people total need jabs. (32.46m doses total)

80% adults achievable (UK almost 90% first doses easily get 80% fully vaccinated) Wow, 10/10 hope CDC wrong. I'm sitting reading articles round affecting kids worse original rounds. I'm sure sampling bias (less old people dying kids hospital getting focus) what. However, kids set go back school 2 weeks. supposed do?? navigate parents? wish kids get vaccinated...this sucks. What?

And believe. hope so, let’s real. many times told “just two weeks, another month, need flatten curve!”? hospitals filling now, mid summer, 70% people vaccinated, don’t see restrictions don’t get attempted fall winter spirals further. I’ll deal wearing mask longer, don’t support heavier restrictions gatherings work, almost certainly going come point. Ontario signed document months ago allowed doctors treat lower chance survival, keep ICUs overloading. I'm guessing that's rationing referring to.  Ontario also cancelled elective surgeries.  may getting surgeries now. Mayo Clinic Provincetown scare mongering Reddit hilarious. like people sheltered understand week long parties men gay sex barely knowing one another.

Like yeah, taking cum men anal sex might catch something. Crazy thought. Makes sense fox single entity Facebook breeds entire groups fanta menace cults. I'm considering myself, walk existing vaccine card ask give another shot? pretend gotten yet? Also, notice side effects last couple days shot (I felt flu-ish half day second, girlfriend felt crappy several days)? Case positivity rate sub bipolar. Several days ago, people saying never wear mask vaccinated, see several threads people implying need lockdowns control delta variant. 

Lol. GOP: ""We hate apples"".

Rational observer: ""You force apples businesses spreads COVID...""

GOP: ""So ADMIT hate Oranges! A-HAAAA!"" haven’t paid mind - say, huh, finally acknowledging - CDC said since March 2020. 
They consistently wrong / misinformed best, downright untrustworthy worst. 
I can’t imagine anything full management purge could get organization back standing held. 

Anyone reading raw data past two months US making level actual critical analysis known report CDC found. 
Many others sub related subs seen anecdotal trends backing report shows, course everyone likes ignore anecdotal evidence despite one best tools past two years. 

Am smug right? 
You bet I’m sure I’ll get hate pointing skyrocketing infection rate growth started witness weeks ago. 

Good luck everyone; keep mask handy, limit unnecessary public interactions, jump chance take vaccine allowed to.   Facebook silently attempting cull idiots. get shit virus mutating become highly infectious nearly deadly. Viruses want keep host alive host dying means virus killed off. COVID eventually mutate like flu become nearly deadly. tell truth. read Bo Burnham song. states want voluntarily get 3rd vaccine, demand dropped enough I'd say go it. I'm seriously considering myself. try working out! It’ll help prevent complications even death case contract virus. I’ve heard stories, confirmed Albertans stopped wearing masks. It’s insane Oh sure. That’s almost never went anywhere mask everywhere go somewhere, continue shots. It’s epilepsy concerned though, rather talk condition. That’s cardiologist I. Geoff Faulkner from Queensland Brain Institute refuting claims COVID-19 enter person’s says claims led “scaremongering” people hesitate Faulkner team’s research published in Cell Reports showed evidence COVID-19 – Pfizer AstraZeneca vaccines – entering DNA




So professor Queensland Brain Institute research. Put many restrictions unvaccinated ruins life take vaccine. I’m talking jab, school. jab, job. jab, government benefits. jab, international travel. jab, entry government buildings like courts DMV. Texas gonna Texas... Insurance companies jack rates states like Florida.

Yeah, amazing people read beyond headline see 80% think total population. Unless change age barrier 64% total population definitely achievable Australia although take while. Yeah. Cool. 🙄 People sub rock hard permanent lockdowns masking forever. zero concept risk calculations acceptance. ABSOLUTELY insane. I’m sure many parents either.

The statement course privileged parent two typical young kids without immunodeficiency issues, understand that. want able make risk decisions myself, zero COVID type health directives take choice away family. UK trying test positve sample major mutations withing 24 hours - samples go away Whole Genome Sequencing. Since latest upsurge cases since May, positives Delta. United States nut shell I’m sure people breakthrough seizure vaccine. definitely causes breakthrough seizure: getting covid High republican black population. Two groups low vaccination rates. What's alternative? People going stay isolating, little choice officially open up. ""step line"" apt telling people keep lockdowns. leaving part estimate vaccine 75-85% effective preventing infection.

So vaccines still work stop spread. say Cape people businesses Memorial day Labor day. 🤣 I'm fucking dead thank 

The original GWB prob fave presidential quote ever This, also, unvaccinated variant factories. long Delta new one kids sights comes along. Could new variant Indonesia? cocktail we've seen India months ago: Sudden surge cases, 30% positivity rate, overpopulated crowded country lots poverty makes lockdowns difficult implement. Yep.

Masks dont block virus perfectly. catch droplets carry virus reduce total amount goes distance travel.


The way seatbelt doesnt make immortal



But look explaining something 99% world knows capable independent thought Send back masks per CDC. clearly don’t kids.  Yes, it’s new *virus*. It’s new *outbreak*. Lick balls feeling booster shots recommended soon.

*cries Australian literally first Pfizer shots*  Absolutely! meant vaccinated people things (and perhaps still considering masks *certain* contexts). Governments role getting message out. No, slide referencing says breakthrough cases MAY transmissible unvaccinated. also says bright ass red letters it’s preliminary data subject change. There’s mention said data got from. 

The word referenced anywhere slide makes think insurance?  We’re going learn live it, 0 covid cases never going happen Yup, total opportunist hypocrite.  percentage fully vaccinated population end symptomatic covid Oh holy shit Well policy maybe Texas Alberta America. Kenney (the premier) Republican counterparts. Although taking shit ton flack latest polls suggest loose next election NDP.  Ebola actually example become less deadly became virulent

Ebola used self containing 60s 70s first started noticing it, would basically wipe entire village could spread

Now makes people less sick longer allowing spread much greater distances newer outbreaks

Of course CFR still extremely high (30%-60%) earlier outbreaks closer 100%

Luckily appears good candidate vaccinate against, we've success anti-virals. also much less contagious something like COVID proper controls hygiene dramatically slow ability spread. Exactly. Moral hazard. COVID positivity rate - percentage COVID tests positive over, think, week. listening epidemiologist radio yesterday claimed giving 3rd shot people wealthy countries already received 2 shots poor use vaccines. would far better distributing poorer countries vaccines. reason dealing delta variant first place India dense population practically vaccines, caused mutate. deal global scale, inevitably prolonging pandemic dangerous mutations continue develop. makes lot sense. government basing solution science encouraging people get 3rd dose. Lol what? exactly picking choosing scientific fact? way describing it, making sound like efficacy rate delta 0% infection plain true.  Thank you. I'm glad see one comment like this. read asked, what's new. knew stuff already. 

TLDR: Get vaccinated. I'm going continue summer mask free. What's concerning [the study longer dosing found. 8-week mark, generally Canada UK doing, almost detectable antibodies left, people badly lagging going back second dose putting risk unvaccinated. stand significantly higher antibody levels afterward, there's always that. suprising, Fox News tame shite goes around social media. no, that's ""probably"" = 51%+. lawyer scientist doubt different. may means nonzero. US always 3 weeks regime 2 doses. However China, 2nd dose schedule strictly controlled, come back 3 weeks, 1 month even 2 months heard. let start 3 doses regime vaccine..... inactivated virus vaccine really need 2 doses effective. 

From people know, fully vaccinated probably still minority, personal experience though. observation younger people usually already got vaccine older ones still kind skeptical think urgent get vaccinated. protection level natural infection minimal nation level. much longer way go herd immunity compare US. seniors Alachua county vaxxed. Gainesville destination counties around it, good hospitals, vaccinate, mask, go Gainesville kinds stuff. might liberal, still COVID saturated. Get fda approved pretty clear based data Provincetown, VACCINATED INDIVIDUALS TRANSMIT VIRUS. can’t pick choose want accept scientific fact. “limited government”? Leave individual cities, towns schools. Seriously though, you’re right. I’m sure  may imply 50% imply 50% would call 75%? 

You’re pulling numbers thin air. May implies number. Monitoring? acting like thing check extra box report. Collecting data ""monitoring"". require extra activity. Alberta long called Texas Canada Fellow redditor stuck Alabama here. post understatement. work public health kinda. much go detail. Needless say, see data time time regarding vaccination rate infected civilians. It’s surprising number one. hospitals part enforce masks. business open, masks even individuals wore masks afraid taking vaccine due misinformation. wore mask you’d ridiculed work, schools, stores, public open spaces. exception major universities. can’t get football teams coaches sick. It’s literally state ignorance fueled denial misinformation.  Shut Fox News What’s that, death rate? evidence shown vaccinated people infected different rates shedding depending severity symptoms?

I dont answer order kn95 masks first time. tests tell delta variant? doctor know says tests say kind variant is.  ended cannabis testing, would bunch applicants. Win-win Vaccinated infections delta present cold. 12yo infections even less. Anecdotally attest kids (3yo 5yo) caught without indication positive test.

I say rip bandaid. want immunity vaccine, get good-old-fashioned risky way infection. dammit, need population reach herd immunity. Jesus would socialist let people earn *little* extra side long honest work community cared for. likely happens patients get full blown Covid disease rather Sars-Cov2 virus. 
We'll know time. case, there's way cases would dropping UK. R0 4 even vaccinated would mean social measures prevent 75% infections fully vaccinated population, prevent virus growing. 

The UK fully vaccinated, doubt social measures preventing 75% infections right now. True.....but guess shut because:downvotes. ? ""I protect me, thee.""

\-- Abbott I'd like answer well please He’s forcing people take put mask though. Individuals whatever want. He’s mandates. We’re point pandemic either mandating everything mandating nothing opinion.  Hopefully they’ll tell families friends get vaccinated go back home. Young people whole least vaccinated. 

I know many zoomers sub, they're dragging whole world carefree selfish.  They’ve juked stats beginning. people blame unvaccinated. Please read comment respond. nothing vaccination status They’re waiting Donald trump come army Q’s physically fight virus. decide weapon choice would be, don’t kind creativity may missed previously - apologize....but shot get initially considering getting time? People forget influenza children actually get pretty bad. ignore assume chances low severe (and rightly so) reason cannot apply thinking covid.  US makes 17% confirmed cases. number likely lot lower since US tests vast majority places find cases.

The odds mutation outside US LOT higher US. odds mutation outside US insanely higher vaccinated people US great news Resident AL fully vaccinated since end April. Nobody wears masks anymore since early June. live alone step dad refuses get vaccine puts 10 year old sister risk. mom says little sister wear mask anyways still alleviate stress it. grew rural southern AL amount stupidity unreal. know nurses get it. realize essentially exact argument people paid student loans make loan forgiveness ?  cat quailified Trump. Wait currently positive, people it?   really large gap... compared apples oranges. pointed fallacy comparison. doubled can't bothered trying reason crazy person.  Still earlier point continuing transmit virus increase rate mutation. Furthermore delta variant consists 5 sub variants. 4/5 susceptible vaccine 1/5 isn’t, likely strain circulating Provincetown. Since strain positive evolutionary adaptation likely spread faster farther wider sub variants, likely becoming dominant sub variant. believe call delta plus. Yeah don’t think I’ve ever caught cold around someone cold. Actually. can’t remember last time stuffy nose wasn’t allergies. longer choice body, it?   brother vaccinated caught delta 5 days 102-104 fever. slept couldn’t eat anything anyone figured regular cloth masks actually cut delta variant transmission? keep reading anything less N95 mask less effective cutting transmission delta. live there. That's terrific /s guess meant comment was, wasn’t big government telling people run businesses restrictions/mandates? person responding made seem like it’s bad thing.  Pandemic* 

Stop hyperbole   That’s paid actors conspiracies start claim actually people vaccinated. Downvoters stupid. answer. 

The case Australia caught simply passing gives us idea quickly happen.  ""Move along ... nothing see here""

If *pretending* problem *fixed* problem, Florida would solved. I'm conflicted one. They're wrong saying indeed way forward; simply cannot sustain current level enforcement forever, truly necessary forever. think biggest problem timing: would made sense wait school year started better sense kind community spread would take place; ideally 12 cohort becomes eligible vaccination. I've hoping they'd mention us j&amp;jers point, seen anything.  long question ? talking lockdowns infinity beyond ? tell virus mutations away escaping lockdowns masks would still say ? Don’t worry, believe imaginary knowing sky wizard protect them… they’ll fine. ROFL!!! bizarre linked document doesn’t even say that. says could *up to* contagious R0 5-9 places chicken pox R0 9. Except chicken pox’s R0 actually 9-10. means highest estimated R0 delta contagious lowest estimated R0 chicken pox. make equal. 

Relevant Slide: document: pox mentioned document R0 9-10: http://ocw.jhsph.edu/courses/publichealthbiology/PDFs/Lecture2.pdf incomprehensible.   even ballpark plague. ~80% mortality rate *least lethal form* (bubonic). killed third half everyone Europe biggest outbreak 14th century. understandably felt world ending. recurrences every decades centuries. must beyond terrifying live through.  Ms 30+ county Beat it... gonna say, 601 breathing sigh relief... temporary may be.   Interesting. he’s applying government overreach state hates government overreach. Reds fun! So... None currently.

You can't say requirement any. 


This article really says all. Despite news yesterday, media beating drum new lockdowns capacity limits, instead they're beating drum vaccinations. proof WORK DELTA. Missouri at? don’t think want outdone Yep. decent sized group people reason want restrictions end, sure fooled. lot reasonable people left May CDC changed guidance went hiding. cant flip flop.

This literally science though. Guidance recommendations change new data becomes available. can't cry, ""Follow science!"" immediately follow ""You can't flip flop!""

Well, either one other. one want? want follow science? want unchanging messaging follow science? Say again: vaccinations save lives. somehow raise pressure willfully unvaccinated. It’s urgent matter public health. Bruh, we're 0.2% Sydney *know* there's serious issue here. We're ready vaccination, unlikely Europe.and North America. Im blown away fact NHS FDA advocating vaccines safe youre blatantly ignoring will. know anecdotal consider Biden agenda similar trump agenda hinged putting virus behind us, particularly return school. Think bout significant data must really willing walk back mask recommendations especially knowing likely decrease vaccine compliance too. load high attaching high rates wahlah infected. vax kick initial exposure matters. I'm wearing mask isolating, feel like exposed lower amounts likely infected. Vaccinated spread Delta unvaccinated vaccinated.

You get tested know risk spreading virus. stated - usual states immediately happily reimpose mask mandates punish vaccinated. need governors guts finally tell people make personal risk assessments get vaccinated.

Last heard NY still ""reviewing"" guidance shocked didnt instantly put back. Cuomo seemed shit - even saying wants people back office/schools Labor day Yes, still do. Like anthrax vaccine. Fox News viewers old AF. average Facebook user younger 2 decades. Adjust age let's see. deadly sorry say it, seems vaccinated people developing long covid symptoms infection. trying scare you... but, main reason self-isolating again. least develop strategy dealing delta surge cases go back down. possible virus may mutate evade degrade antibody response. burn out, know when. like Jesus would wanted.  


Fuck guy. There's special place hell reserved him.  I’m starting suspect actually covid human form, disguise… he’s acting virus. Goddamn it. Well done sir. Well done. gold - recipient. strange hill (literally) die on. Fighting “right” spread dangerous contagious variant pandemic.

I haven’t felt angry state things US since first waves anti-mask/anti-lockdown protests year ago might mortician's issue now. zeta omega wipes us /s/ cut person talks like that, family friend. tired idiocy. I've longer tolerate them. anthrax vaccine approved given it. approved many, many years still requirement military members. guys sounds like conspiracy theorist. 

It's total number known symptomatic cases divided total number fully vaccinated people.

It's useful metric determining personal risk even personally like it. Ah gotcha.. I'd forgotten that. Thanks comment 😊 like reddit much better, every coronavirus subreddit huge number users spreading misinformation usual coronavirus misinformation subreddits. Gottlieb others predicted last “major wave” covid lot well vaccinated countries precisely reason. Lots immune coverage ways. always pretty spot realistic predictions tend think that’s headed. also made point delta likely peak quicker prevalence. probably far deeper wave know. assumed delta son's positive. He's 3 caught another 3yo. got mild breakthrough. Typical covid strains contagious among kids likely result breakthroughs. Stupid enough avoid visit US near future  Almost 12 months yeah, side effects associated accumulative effects vaccine all. Technically speaking sky *looks* blue, people animals perceive blue. 🤓 management actually acknowledge wrong? 
I mine double return plan us. 
At first meeting yesterday said “next week.” 
Gee, thanks heads up, dudes. That's so, sad.

I due day got vaccinated back February. hoping fully vaccinated 4 months pregnant gave Bean antibodies.   Oh totally wouldn't. Ozark white evangelical separatists taking vaccine. They'd delight seeing ""trialed"" brown people. Exactly this. thing happens homosexuality abortion tons things. They’re anti abortion need it. They’re gay marriage it’s son daughter. sudden something clicks act like it’s huge revelation. scale use writing data analyses (I'm research analyst working PhD stats/research methods).

""may"": non-zero chance (even small 5%) 
""probably"": greater 50%  Seriously talking about. \*Cries Singapore\* live Alabama work federal installation. announced yesterday civilians contractors must wear masks times federal buildings.

People can't prove they're vaccinated undergo routine testing. imagine, pearl clutching going right amongst workforce hilarious. correct. However data suggests becoming virulent, pathological, deadly. trend towards development worse virus. Also per Pfizer’s data announced earnings call weak vaccine effectiveness severe disease wanes 80% 6 months second dose. Source Pfizer earnings call CNBC interview Albert Bourla first ones side effects all. I’m concerned. still know exactly do, already said distance, stay home, mask up,

You've already got vaccine, that's best individual do.  Doubtful guess natural selection job. Woah, read slides? Even CDC call data definitive preliminary. CDC head even rare, unvaccinated people account bulk virus transmission, Dr. Walensky said.  believe individual level might, updated  
recommendation,” Dr. Walensky said email Times.

So yes, vaccinated people may well transmit virus bad levels likely right transmit extent person replying right well. even CDC definitively confirmed anything yet. know today.   ""An expert panel India's central drug authority Thursday recommended granting permission Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore conducting clinical trial mixing two Covid-19 vaccines -- Covaxin Covishield""

""The SEC (subject expert committee) detailed deliberations recommended granting permission CMC, Vellore conducting phase-4 clinical trial covering 300 healthy volunteers mixing Covid-19 vaccines Covaxin Covishield,""  Societal tolerance.

Maybe 2021 one booster. Next year think people would happy get shot shot.

Problem booster shot distrubuted, yet another infectious variant appears?

So government hesitant, unless clear booster absolutely necessary. whyd Tuberville. Saban would probably really good job. Apply process government 😂 portable bidet. Anyone least 1 month bidet usage decides going without barbaric. Pretty sure consistent experience across board. We've toilet one since January 2019, battery powered travel bidet since March 2019, got camper, got dedicated portable bidet keep there.

You’re telling uneducated state worst pandemic response. Color shocked! /s validity this? Agreed, need clarity true game changer entire world. also strange jurisdiction made claim; I'm going remain touch skeptical validity statement, particular conclusion drawn lab study. part near bottom claiming compensation adverse reactions. Look CICP. reasonable expect end wave, many people either vaccinated infected, mitigating future outbreaks? could see changed CDC guidance point? I’m hanging word may that’s literally science saying. 

I honestly don’t even know kind poi you’re trying make tribal here. live AL near enough equivalent state. tribal. hear fucking town crier. long vaxxed, mask try distance.

I think anyone's mind changed, point. Stay safe - I'm FL, boat.  Hey, central Alabamian here. Got Vaccinated soon possibly could. second shot April 11. Literally *everyone* know (at least I'm friends with) got vaccinated restrictions lifted CVS Walgreens *throw many away* dipshits signing get vaccinated showing up.

Our ""big boss"" hated worked home all, even though 80-90% job done remote, wanted ass chairs asap. building 3-person department wore masks office, literally every person/building adhere mask mandate.

It's disgusting outrageous amount stupidity here. us - plenty good folks around trying right thing, we're held captive old fucking assholes spoon-fed good boy points rich old fucking assholes letting know Daddy Trump going make rich racists. poor family rings going start dropping. 
This time next year might family trees though! Officially planned thing? correct even 75% effective, still 25% people walking around unknowingly transmitting infection increasing rate mutation. unacceptable want pandemic end. kind like wants people die miserable death covid. Sure, covid mutate spread though vaccinated populations. evidence protection becomes weak enough bring back risk hospitalization? Looking Provincetown outbreak, there's almost 900 positive cases 7 hospitalizations. know vaccination rate 100%... I'd willing bet 7 hospitalized unvaccinated.

Which comes back main point... cares covid evolves evade complete eradication vaccination that's left something presents cold? There's millions viruses there, colds, flu variants, etc... right now, mutating. one could end lethal (spanish flu 1920's ~30% lethality rate example) odds small. new covid variants end another cold pass vaccinated populations, really matter? Yeah, *could* evolve deadly, could influenza type A, one millions viruses caught every year prior 2020. got downvoted *bloody hell* asking back months ago b.1 variant found campus shows breaking immunity vaccines. recovered infection yesterday.

We reddit! Clinic researchers recently published a study that shows proper use masks reduces spread respiratory droplets. 




Well looks like Mayo Clinic research.



Meanwhile antiMa believe masks innefective can't block Covid19 viruses, also effective masks block gases made 3 atoms like Oxygen CO2. We're shocked  Fuck em..like fuck sisters.

Getting multiple variants vaccine provides slightly better coverage. live here.... I'm loss else people damn stubborn here. DeSantis ban testing cases go down. Far behind aim, aim least vaccineate 80% population. include children, least 12-17 September. Educated not, people still voted Kenney in. there’s large percentage Albertans phenomenally stupid last 18 months. Albertans shown complete idiots. start learning science

now lets look inventor mRna says vaccine....

he it???? sciene??? god science failed me?????

its almost science isnt singular object.... I'm arguing validity CDC mask guidelines. literally said probably err side caution. arguing grand scheme current Covid situation, vaccinated people probably play small role driving transmission compared unvaccinated (who typically also people refuse wear masks) wasting time polarizing people putting responsibility people that, part, done supposed do.

And side note, slippery slope logical fallacy assumption made one thing (A) happens certainly lead something else (B) that, reality, unfounded, assertion made fear rather reasonable argument A. WOULD slippery slope say government could punish misinformation, Republicans would prosecuted government hates them. slippery slope say government could punish misinformation, point people would likely punished spreading truths government deem false. example, pandemic began, Dr. Fauci said masks futile stopping spread. Prosecuting people disagreed would hindrance slowing Covid, better yet, punish Fauci spreading misinformation saying masks work? I'm saying good thing science function independently government flip-flop things face new evidence without worrying legal ramifications.

If want talk logical fallacies, used ad hominem attack calling people wear masks ""babies,"" used black white argument saying unmasked vaccinated people ""no better"" unvaccinated people, reality much protected getting infected transmitting Covid. Vaccinated people wear masks get hospitalized transmit, people combination two things, varying degrees. Treating two different groups equal want make mask-wearers vs. anti-maskers logical fallacy.  Bro serious lol scientist say media bound requirements scientific community held to. agree CDC messaging hard follow agree media breaks information first, push back sense scientific method must followed prove trend media anecdotally reporting on. Sometimes means replicating results additional study followed board peer review results.

I saying could political, I'm merely stating proper method must followed. lot moving parts must move order information presented. Republicans terrorists  we’ll living Covid rest lives like 99% diseases exist, normalcy I’m talking one restrictions - masks, social distancing, testing unless sparse localized outbreaks possible vaccinate enough people. 

Yes. That's pipe dream. Make peace actually need high vaccination rates achieve herd immunity protect people idiots can’t basic responsibility getting vaccinated protect communities, much less themselves.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Making choices people will? People take vaccines idiots? racist, African Americans nearly lowest rates vaccination among ethnic group. fact, white Americans vaccinated rate 3 times higher Black Americans. New CDC figures show received least first dose vaccine, 5.4% Black people, compared 60% white people. According recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 35% Black Americans said don’t plan get vaccine, citing fears safety concerns vaccines Right you.  Wait Indiana? What?  Like take vaccine become high viral load super spreading plague rat? Wrong account. @sailorrooscout name chise. one random e. Account. really don’t want credible anymore, they? problem suffer it.

The answer make mandatory. CDC data says 469 total cases identified. science knew going happen think leaked reports CDC peg R value 8 9 delta variant. 60,000 *Provincetown* summer population. many people crammed bars staying Truro/Wellfleet/Eastham/Orleans/etc? gop realize they're killing people support them?  Mayo Clinic? Really? like Lamo Clinic. I'll stick Facebook feed thank much.  Funny mouth breathers elected office murica bc fda trash else would it? doubt legislature change ban mask mandates. many legislators receiving 1 call favor masks every 9 10 calls against. 

ACT 1002 include penalties non-compliance. handful school districts signaling intention mandate masks, even it’s overturned/changed. huge mistake Biden CDC. requirements suggested drop mask mandates county reaches 70% vaccination rate. 

That way could pinned idiots wall outbreak happened. Instead gave unvaccinated power listening anymore private businesses needed choice require masks before, allowed choice. Huh, weird stance understanding science, history, logic, more. read Wikipedia 1918 pandemic picture health service announcement paper. Literally first thing listed 'Do take person's breath'. movie 'Idiocracy' becoming reality? Truthfully articles good lately. explain much tend favor ""if bleeds leads."" 

So fun. 

4 5 hospitalized vaccinated. Thats kinda shocking IMO.

Lets say 1000 (close enough) people infected due outbreak.

75% vaccinated 750 people. 4 hospitalized. 

25% unvaccinated 250 people. 1 hospitalized. 

So chance 1 187.5 hospitalized vaccinated outbreak

1 250 unvaccinated.

This seems worrisome it? thoughts is? Truthfully-lots things happen. Surgeries get cancelled post op area becomes overflow ICU. ER begins boarding ICU patients decreases throughout. 
At point hospitals begin implementing tents staging. entire ER Peds ER (if one) converts majors area overflow ICU. ER already plumbed oxygen available beds plus outlets needed run IV pumps machinery. Tents get set minor care staging, usually parking lot main ER. 

What get system patients get triaged arrival major minor. Typically Covid’s go tent normalish vitals get sent home, often portable oxygen sensor instructions oxygen gets low. Minors like lacs sprains get treated streeted quickly possible emphasis quick follow primaries catch things may missed. Majors still go ER/ICU care may good could without.

Thanks politics people. Profit people would mandating masks monopoly manufacturing them... would support whatever fuck Texas currently doing.  “If information today would gotten vaccinated.""

You *did* information, chose ignore it. Zero sympathy.  something even understand beginning. politicizing issue pretty early on. I'm thinking, ""if guys wrong covid kills lot people, literally making voters susceptible."" Even think covid serious selfish, entitled prick, selfishness kick try err side caution reason make sure voters stay around? Let’s assume easy math. 75% exposed vaccinated. 75% cases vaccinated.

That means efficacy vaccine 0%. good. shit, Sherlock think wrong account, got like 6 posts Chinese language like that. wouldn’t happening got vaccine.

...but would happened. doesnt stop spread. could still got covid.

That’s tiny amount, need freak out.” - Pro gun lobbyist, probably People angry situation. It’s good. We've tried nothing, we're ideas! Abbott limiting government abusing dumbass bases' low education level.

Good news baby early childhood coffin making business! possibly justifiable? would anyone Austin care locality like Grapevine issued mask mandate? even enforced? governor's powers unlimited. absolutely idiotic political theatre point I’m genuinely surprised people still buying crap. you’re vaxxed, you’re protected much, much unvaccinated. mention never significant risk throughout pandemic way beginning till virus transmitted outdoors. world would someone who’s already fence vaccinated want get shot seeing news? They're killing people.

Plain simple blame selfish vaccinated super spreading plague rats carrying high viral loads. US? Texas. Build wall, around Texas. point. Preventing deaths hospitalization right. least that’s thought got vaccine.  Good point Let’s assume easy math. 75% exposed vaccinated. 75% cases vaccinated.

Absurd pro-Rona talk elected officials (and majority populace) followed us shockingly well vaccine distribution (not sure Trump-admin favoritism hand Tribal distribution definitely helped) like 6th nation ice storm promptly picked back hitting ~30% vaccinated rates going almost nobody getting vaccinated anymore pro-Rona talk gettin dialed 11 becoming pro-Rona policies. love several double entendres slid there. Article hitting sobering scientific analysis published Friday explosive Massachusetts covid-19 outbreak fueled delta variant found three-quarters people became infected fully vaccinated. report, Centers Disease Control Prevention, bolstered hypothesis vaccinated people spread transmissible variant may factor summer surge data, detailed CDC’s Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report, provided key evidence convinced agency scientists reverse recommendations mask-wearing advise vaccinated individuals wear masks indoor public settings study found vaccinated individuals carried much virus noses unvaccinated individuals, vaccinated people could spread virus other. CDC criticized week changing mask guidance without citing unpublished data. report released Friday contains data.

A CDC internal document obtained Washington Post estimated 35,000 vaccinated people week symptomatic breakthrough infections vaccinated population 162 million. Vaccination coverage higher average Massachusetts, nearly 70 percent residents fully vaccinated.
“This shows delta formidable,” said Larry Corey, virologist Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. “We can’t take one report packed bars extrapolate say sky falling. sky falling. say vaccine sense used,” Corey said. “It’s learning moment, it’s teaching moment. can’t overlook vast data effectiveness vaccine.” Fuck yeah.

You must provide proof vaccination get nasal brain probe every week. Also much paper pushers teleworking don’t even think tests apply come back office.

I’ve actually enjoyed random strangers breathing neck checkout line. value small government, value dysfunctional government. 


Because government ever allowed work, people might demand start taxing wealthy pay it, simply cannot allowed. think overestimate effect would general election. Additionally conservative voter base shrinks year year old age probably see shift republican party try catch people middle set tracker specifically states compared everywhere else. Keep eye see trends new cases soon.  want limited government unless government pushing agenda.  Anyone good sense data much protection one fully vaxxed (Pfizer) recovered breakthrough case (mild symptoms)? I'm going live life normal wondering feel reasonably well protected re-infection next months. anything it’s great example someone needs vaccinated. Every little bit helps Base rate fallacy effective vaccine would something like

80% population vaxed 50% cases vaxed. large percentage cases vaxed people it’s less percentage total vaxed population.

If percent vaccinated cases percent people vaccinated population means risk unvaccinated person.

Again, downvote away people math based numbers provided story. Good you, hope wearing seat belt works you. Actual CDC report well. lie say first shot even ask anything? I'm curious would want do.

Mandatory vaccines? hell time enforcing that, plus cause vaxxed dig harder.

There's much population give fuck. Sure, also unaware spreader Texas freedom. Texas much big government. Welp, we're officially survival fittest stage. strong live, weak die, good political narrative Abbott others like want course good economy. masses sycophants cheering consequences damned. 

Couple Hurricane Season coming we're wild one. Yeah...I used wearing one inside figured I'd keep it. I've gone dinner times without one though cases area downward slide again. also showing much viral load even vaccinated people spread Delta variant. Thus rationale behind vaccinated people masking up.  piece information concerning, seems like scientists, along officials Massachusetts Department Public Health, reported 79 percent vaccinated breakthrough infections symptomatic. Four five people hospitalized fully vaccinated. analyzing genetic fingerprints virus samples taken trace chains transmission determine commonly fully vaccinated people infecting one another. mean republicans slowly worshiping regan more, regan really set bar body count genuinely ape shit crazy! ""Overreaction"" aside, morally bankrupt.

Certainly, I've seen businesses close pandemic change models afford so; arguably that's one reason PPP created - help keep businesses afloat arguably help keep safe business.

In Yorba Linda, example, Taps (a local chain) started renovate old restaurant open - pandemic. pandemic hit, kept working, also created outdoor seating using parking lot space, could comply current safety guidelines. problems opening new restaurant pandemic, well established place.

This HB restaurant took money exact opposite, everything power make unsafe possible, including putting staff risk forcing remove masks (hence OSHA fines) bemoaning government ""overreaction,"" despite statistics clearly pointing serious increase COVID infections due delta variant. 

Some businesses lucky enough additional space make outdoor eating areas, especially places downtown LA heavily urbanized. look Basilico's map parking lot space use outdoor dining space, like Taps did. 

Personally, little sympathy somebody who's going use restaurant political platform, instead simply serving food drink respecting health regulations welfare guests staff, using money create safer outdoor eating space like many SoCal eatersies have. person like government oversight, regulations, compliance, restaurant business pretty poor choice vocation.

I'll curious see long place stay business rate. Yeah part Dutch approach return normal. Test events, sports games access, kind things. Appointments time slots places like Zoo's. on. That's there's much research particular case went wrong. Fortunately, people blue areas self-govern generally right thing. mitigate damage extent.  Lol. bet guy hasn’t watched someone gasp air slowly die Corona.  one side benefit blue town residents probably smart enough still mask even though vaccinated.

You would surprised number ""red town residents"" exist blue areas though. community Texas, example, pretty good number vaccinated people, voted Clinton Biden, pretty good masking participation, etc. However, know kids neighborhood whose parents reich-wingers trying bully kids wear masks. weight making right decision school going solely shoulders kids told loudmouth bullies they're sissies wimps wearing masks. Yes, cause safe something function scared are. That's never wear seat belt, aint skurrd front window ejection. Can’t businesses like target Disney whatever want though?   giving Government authority inject people vaccines know long term effects probably smartest thing do. Also, vaccines magic solution initially advertised alone stop rise new variants fact could push evolution strains evade protection, researchers warned Maybe blame people responsible instead entire state. I’m sure every single vaccinated individual including resents bullshit much do. fucking angry everyone else, we’re ones stuck middle this. mask mandates implemented county level then? ah, makes sense. thank you! guess figures population calculation house representatives, ok bunch people die now. hope includes Broadway tours, highly doubt able get away states like mine covid surging... unfortunately. Luckily shows part tours until, think, January just…I honestly don’t words anymore. fucked. Give tech education. son program half day high school training trades got good full time job right high school. HVAC firm even paying certificate program community college. still home, save money truck. really, eventually run people infect, one way other. Hopefully add fuel antivax fire People said thing months ago lifted mask mandate, spike never came.  shame pesky thing called reality come crash party. Unfortunately, possibly affects recommended videos include anti-vaxx nutjobs.

Its exhausting. Okay open see problem. need cautious.

Lol people still learned anything 18 months pandemic. law unconstitutional. legislature doesn’t come senses, courts them. week’s edition of… Texas worst… Teachers strike schools can’t provide safe working conditions. seems fair.

Bringing back wild wild south   Republican hypocrisy finest. Conservatives really think “small government”?

Insanity Texan, I'm glad priorities straight. diverted absurd amount budget building wall, electricity premiums cost housands dollars month, least rednecks read, wear masks. 

Honestly, think Abbott looking replace Trump dumbest politician history  True Gottlieb believes true top estimate likely correct. Probably better assume worst act accordingly. feels like we’ve reactive whole thing instead proactive. new Executive Order emphasizes path forward relies personal responsibility rather government mandates

Uh, like exact mandate? someone claims want less government interference, sure using government power interfere. course right, corporations report shareholders quarterly basis. Q2 2020 tank, heads roll, especially competitors better. great news, never attend either way money. 

You get many clicks story crying mother whose child dying Covid. newspapter - plenty clicks interview doctor(!!) saying flu worse thing Covid. Facebook much extreme this. im vaccinated, wear mask, live rich austin area. covid rip state abbott less voters mean though.

If 10,000 people room together 75% vaccinated 25% vaccinated. could lead number scenarios 3/4ths infections among vaccinated.

Could 75 100 750 1000 7500 10000  say lot ""city folk"" also getting vaccinated due (lack of) education vaccines. number people support idiots dwindling. Mostly people love fucking die. children’s hospitals filling now.

It's possible continues, especially since seems like dem GOP stakeholders page vaccinations lately.  


I think good news regardless, months daily conciousness, question months look like.  sure lotta flights n outta florida! even trying nothing, explicitly legislating ""do nothing"" law land forbidding governing bodies trying something. least freedom they’re controlled. /s

Go Darwinism It’s definitely grind, we’ve done two years one kid another year two haven’t complete breakdown yet. Ironic people refuse wear mask claim government wants control you. law banning cities mask policy controlling? ways bury head sand covid19, got top 3. doc office requires masks. yesterday.
Something Texas medical association whatever it’s called. Could president ban banning mask mandates? Texan here. Greg Abbott embarrassing piece shit. entire state gov't is, actually. guarantee it’s easily twenty times amount. Thought republicans locals governing little ignorant this. anyone explain unvaccinated causing anyone catch anyway whether received vaccine? I’ve already told virus mutated people weren’t vaccinated, variant discovered December vaccine rollout. want bit information anyone offer it. I’d appreciate much. require masks, offer in-person schooling majority teaching time. 

Requiring people public spaces school forbidding schools requiring masks insanity me. Like that's actually willfully creating conditions know people die. completely ineffective.

Wow, pessimistic much?

Mrna 94% effective symptomatic infection alpha. 88% delta. AZ takes hit well, still well 50%

Looking (small) Indian study cited cdc presentation, serum ppl mrna vaccine better neutralizing DELTA serum AZ vaccinated ppl ALPHA.

Further, viral load part paper (data supplement) based physicians got AZ vaccine. wr know viral loads mrna.

If goal widespread vaccination, need reinforce efficacy vaccines presence delta, unnecessary call question downplay efficacy. Lol. They're adopted. Saying social workers hard. Kind makes wonder want Normal wear mask travel without worry getting tested. even stupidity bigger texas.... * party oil industry subsidies (Military \*COUGH\* \*COUGH\*)
* party women imprisonment (abortion \*COUGH\* \*COUGH\*)
* party war (iraq iraq vietnam escalation \*COUGH\* \*COUGH\*)
* party lincoln, today lincoln would democrat ... require masks know everyone vaccinated? make optional want wear one? say “I’m going put partisanship people” without saying “I’m going put partisanship people” US Europe administers first vaccines starting Dec'2020 concentrate first healthcare workers. US March nearly every state fully administered healthcare workers, elderly, people conditions, opened eligibility general public 15+, states earlier others, mostly March. May eligibility expands include 12+, anyone wants vaccine get one. states June already vaccinated anyone wants it, struggling get last holdouts. Furthermore states vaccinate anyone shows up, could foreigner visiting vacation California get vaccine here. 

Japan received first doses 20k, 3 months US Europe, earmarked first 4 million doses, expected arrive next two months, healthcare workers. late April Japan able expand eligibility elderly 65+. Pfizer, May 21st Moderna AstraZeneca approved use, AZ temporarily put hold, big blow Japan made AZ manufacturing plant. first shipments Moderna expected arrive June 40 million doses, Japanese government announced eligibility would expand everyone 15+ June 21st (which less 6 months ago), 12.7 million doses showed month expected. Japan offered vaccine China use IOC, turned offer instead reserved part shipments IOC. Combine reservation delivery Moderna, failure AZ, people got angry. 

Right Japanese government goal secure enough vaccine population September vaccinate willing people November. leads 3rd point made- Japanese people inherent distrust vaccines. comes botched MMR vaccine deployment early 90s, lead public outcry measles vaccine longer required Japan (Or least decade ago), huge groups people turning flu shots afterwards. Japan still worst measles outbreaks first world country. vaccine hesitancy difficult overcome. 

So circle back question, correct Japan receiving huge shipments Pfizer Europe, started receiving 3 months later compared US Europe. problems two major vaccines. large groups population resisted vaccine. I’m sure part talks vaccine longer effective preventing serve illness Yeah AZ wild right now. Ducey basically told CDC get fucked libs get owned

It's literally sizable portion Republicans care costs. moved Florida Last month. Granted moved Ohio much different say least.. Good question. Sore throat runny nose here! Maybe air quality really crappy right now? I'm presenting one two panels anime convention Labor Day weekend. I'm fully vaccinated, I'm terrified getting infected then, causing miss con. compounded fact business trip Canada week before. anxiety getting better know (besides keeping mask on). This. I'm SW Missouri trying tell people couple months.

The worst even get vaxxed today fully like 6 weeks insidious pretend they're interfering. That's wish people would stop spreading news like ""between March July, xx infected x compared xxxxxxxxx unvaccinated."" idea many asymptomatic vaccinated people spreading Delta. data taken variants dominant. Preventing variants important battling current ones. actually look article cell reports, isn’t science proof regarding vaccines paper, comment author. Title blatantly wrong. Meanwhile, HOA demanding get permission color mulch use flower beds.

Weird priorities. think you’re alone. understand mechanisms cause isolation negatively impact mental health, masks? mask negatively impact mental health? 

Admittedly, wear mask easily don’t feel discouraged wear it, also kid can’t vaccinated wear mask many deaths family (as many Black folks US) feel frustrated one measure. there’s ton bias part, I’m wanting learn different perspectives. I’ll grab popcorn slowly watch Texas kill itself. Sounds like towns secede tejas make state. Portugal took things seriously. Mandatory masks, curfews, tests Republicans want make America country poor sick people.  


Makes weak country cheeks? Explain Texas land freedom? Wow. That’s backassward logic. 

“People mostly infected gatherings aren’t wearing masks, wearing masks theatre”. What'd many people die of? assuming vaccines never updated. I’ll challenge that. brother (41) died COVID complications underlying issues. mom (70) died vent two weeks COVID. brain blood clots ultimately killed her. sister experienced Mom dying hospice I’ll say fucking terrible. got vaccine first day could. sister…. still day thinks vaccine conspiracy…. even got COVID weeks ago pretty bad still would get vaccine all. words crazy is.  wear mask properly photo opportunities. Lol, sorry, gonna trust people know they're talking instead, thanks playing though. ^pay ^them ^more I’m trying troll vaccine causing asymptomatic spreaders virus shown positive tests getting tested couldn’t vaccinated individuals spreading close rate delta? Genuine question. Schools using cheek swab. think CA state employees vaccinated tested cheek swab well. sad fact many texans praise this. Except countries recognize 'mixed vaccine' approach led countries treating Canadians mixed vaccines treated unvaccinated. social media post going around someone went Barbados mixed doses, surprised arrival find they'd quarantine entire vacation treated unvaccinated. screwed 16th word sentence. ""Thought"". ""thought"" republicans. submission. higher authority. Fully, total, utter, on-their-backs submission authority. Period. A+ timing mean masks, social distancing, etc. going become permanent?  got awkward people recently moved Texas California. Sadly, describing old days Broadway eating/drinking house allowed. days, theatres allow patrons--usually tourists--take full advantage.  CDC considers vaccinated people enough risk enough us mask again. CDC pushing bare minimum try get compliance whole time erring side caution would smart thing. assume insignificant hand spread seems like easy way get another ""oops, wish done better"" situation. CDC lots yet-unpublished data supposed released today impacted changes wait get current info dig outdated info.

If folks want babies pass masks despite CDC guidance better eyes rest them. still ge hospitalized, still transmit, still contributing problem.

And side note slippery slope logical fallacy, intended rhetorical argument. see going going disagree case. actually stepped messaging filed law suits people blatantly lying probably could saved lot lives. draw lines sand come.  giving Texas back Mexico what? guess gay men locale?

Wow TIL Could well be. still yet get vaccine whatever reason, Bless hearts.

For vaccines, smart go, soon enough. matter time now. That’s 14-year old take though

Nothing guarantee actions take increase chance good things decrease bad things. smokers fat people diabetics whoever else want put group falling ill time. constant wave smokers getting ill simultaneously, point ERs choose new patients, hospitals shutting normal operations, opening emergency field hospitals, hiring every single travel nurse could find paying one thousands dollars week still enough staff, hospitals running PPE, bring morgue trucks, bury people mass graves, ran oxygen, close massive parts economy - smokers, better believe there'd pushback smokers. Sandy Hook would like word. Also states major teacher shortages. Hmmm, wonder why... Explain. guys alright? sounds exhausting. I've alive past year heard arguments longer that. Lol Ouch. True.  Probably That’s problem. vaccinated people punished idiots won’t right thing? supposed feels like it’s naught. 19. I’ve Covid didn’t hurt me. got vaccinated, scared dying Covid, wanted protect around also wear mask anymore. feels like really nothing. sucks feels like endless time loop Seriously wtf wrong people?? Disease incubators = Texans. natural outcome millions people aren’t allowed buy food?

They’ll hungry. kids hungry. know exactly them: you.

I wonder much longer blowback starts?  Delta variant worse outcomes children previous strains. answer almost always family support structure. Sometimes it’s jobs. lot jobs here. I’ve tried convince wife move years support structure family much anchor. It’s going happen. Abbott’s mind wired differently… differently, mean incorrectly. Oh good, thinking Texas needs Covid. guy idiot. Yah it’s reasoning companies drug test, don’t want people stuff may make less productive. True. maybe pleas touch like minded. That's good thing, probably doctors encouraged speak out. There's lawsuit coming Arkansas. going get worse, looking like Delta catch if. already know fully vaxxed people confirmed delta, screwed unvaxxed. thinking Covid hijacked mind theory works too. haven’t forgotten. What’s funny surrounding lost power intermittent power 4 days many people ended frozen pipes etc. live pretty Republican area would certainly kinds people contribute big bucks politicians. interesting it’s time vote Abbot out. anti-vaxxers lean right half million fewer come Nov 2024. wonder strategists consider ramifications especially tight battleground states getting hit hard  I'm naming Hannity specifically he's idiot hear radio. I'm sure they're living large city. put things perspective, home state CT one higher rates vaccination country. Delta causing rise cases like everywhere, positivity rate infection 2.3%. Meanwhile, Alabama, one lower states comes vaccination rates, 21% positivity rate infection. Hey everybody, Three Dog, friendly neighborhood disc jockey. What’s “disc”? Hell know. I’m gonna keep talkin’ anyway.

Don’t feed Yao Guai! all. Pushaw Governors PR person auditioned job continuously trashing Rebekah Jones.

She brought clean Gov Desantis image re-election next year.

Zero credibility.

And ""the Florida Department Health leader data reporting transparency throughout pandemic"", come Orlando Sentinel sue get COVID reports Florida government? love it.

Take charge health.

Leave everyone else alone.  Yes, go Ireland! WOOOO, get vaccines! normalcy return to. Give pipe dream. ""they"" ""they"" consist of?  Funny, I’ve always referred island civility amidst sea barbarity - might bit charged politically way put it. Alberta spiking again, government removed covid restrictions. even people confirmed covid positive required isolate. yes read right, government says covid positive people go restaurants, pubs, school, market. mind boggling Coooollllll Note dates link year old.

I'd like know Gottlieb get's evidence 1M day.

But I'm pretty skeptical anyone knows they're talking about. Year old data unsupported speculation seem best -- that's nothing. Nobody knows sure, first principles tell us 129-year history virology (the first virus, tobacco mosaic virus, detected 1892) good century immunology public health. might flying blind, still know fly. quite whose local schools, hospitals, restaurants, grocery stores, movie theaters, buses, subways, airports, etc restrictions. lot. doesn’t matter whether I’m ok it. read disclaimer? isn’t political views I’ve tried make pretty clear. Would limiting government? Obviously, yes! Would unconstitutional? Obviously, yes! constitution prevents federal government stepping states’ toes like that. 

Again, disclaimer: made expression political views post. wearing mask still increase likelihood spread it. lot won’t vaccinated. I've heard many stupid things response 600,000. 

""You know mislabeling anything 'potentially' COVID related COVID death. number wrong."" 

""Same flu deaths last years."" (it's not) Surprised Texas isn’t wasteland yet! Thanks concern. 
Perhaps consider visiting children left long term (maybe life long, simply don’t know yet) damage health COVID-19. 
I sure reassuring “there tiny change Covid hurt you” really make feel better. 

Good getting vaccinated, understand everyone different risk acceptance levels. 
When age probably would thought / talked much like are. 
I responsible though life health care isn’t something I’m willing compromise on. asshat trying kill people? Abbott opposite Biden/White house does. embarrassing looks like whining child get way. Fair, edit ""felt."" isn’t going Florida thing. Duval county like 59% fully vaxxed lags behind higher vaxxed areas 10%. factor natural immunity much Florida got last year it’s pretty clear delta gonna hit everyone. Nah, they’ll nervous breakdowns panic attacks. :-( little, would effectively shut travel countries that. No. everyone vaccinated/previously infected, spread serious disease much lower. become endemic, probably cause worldwide pandemic. people likely vaccinated. pretty fear mongering [...] don’t know still sounds like vaccine working. 

You acknowledge vaccines work keep severe symptoms fact delta effective breakthrough infection. mutually exclusive. understand like hearing news (me neither) true.  Boomer alert: Four five people hospitalized also vaccinated. That’s good. wondering wtf going here. good theory. Also MASS one highest (if highest) vaccinated state. Watch even people make trip cross rio free vaccine Dial rhetoric lmao houses though. Oh no, they're perfectly capable adaptation, evolution response change. 

They constantly get worse, belligerent, violent. went 20 years without catching flu.

Then kids. Caught 3-4 times 5 years. Stomach flu best, especially 5 people throwing 3am. fuck wrong US? Considering Massachusetts one highest vaccination rates country, nearly 70%, sounds like good deal. me, started finding incredibly uncomfortable (yes, I've tried lots varieties) hot. makes feel like difficult breathe. pretty quickly became huge acne issue (and yes, I've tried washing frequently, disposable masks, etc). That's actually pretty damn painful, obviously hit self confidence, far appears permanent scars. longer continue wearing them, worse that's going get.

Those things still case, top there's whole mental piece. Masks undoubtedly put idea people's heads (or keep there) we're disease vectors other. feels like pushes us point view people way anymore, that's really really depressing. constant reminder terrible things happened past year, honestly putting mask enough make spiral rest day point (and recognize I'm pretty lucky sense put one every single day go work).

So something enjoyable marred combination physical discomfort/actual pain pretty serious mental issues them. pushed long time try keep things love support community, anymore.

I know sounds dumb lot people used issues them, honestly way I'm feeling. got vaccinated asap pretty big motivator fact another step towards removing masks, point requirement comes back live, I'm going home time again. let anxiety control thoughts. vaccinated best medical protection available planet protect pandemic.

I'm sending positive vibes, I'm looking forward hearing awesome con presentation goes. keep masking need to, keep little things keep safe, keep thinking fun con be. Pro-Take-Your-Life party  take step leave individual? mandate stop people cities wearing masks. Cities usually lean blue wants make sure least many democrats die republicans. vaccinated people catching tracking real numbers gonna rough Fun thing survive, innate immunity getting isn’t good got vaccine first place, meaning could get feel like garbage every time. 

But get get vaccine, vaccine make feel infinitely worse would gotten vaccine first place gotten getting sick. 

Literally took hardest road get there. many die and/or long term side effects listening Republican / Trump rhetoric. Unvaccinated people get tested go hospital. Vaccinated people get tested hear possible exposure. like wear masks often, vaccinated likely tested asymptomatic. Case closed. CDC also works.  disturbing confusing.

882 tied outbreak. Among lived Massachusetts (which could anywhere 4 882), 74% fully immunized (highly concerning). vast majority (of 882? individuals? vast majority 51% 99%?) reporting symptoms (mild symptoms?). Seven people hospitalized (again, smaller group full 882?). it’s 882, &lt;1% hospitalized. 882 many people? Hundreds? Thousands? Tens thousands? people fully vaccinated (which true) you’d certainly expect higher amount infections among vaccinated areas many people vaccinated, it’s hard make heads tails WEAR MASK. plain safer, fully vaccinated otherwise, go public wearing pants shoes it’s entitled whiny posturing claim wearing mask inconveniencing. ever happened common sense? mandatory class. can’t ban abortion legally, that’s pretty bad example. Leaving mask requirements individual towns cities would definition limited government case. fucking placating moron. god damned thin piece fabric wear go store shopping. I've manual labor on. FUCKING BAD DUMBASS DRAMA QUEENS. WEAR FUCKING MASK.  It’s exactly condolences.  wouldn’t need executive order that’s wanted. thinks Abbott overstepping power isn’t he? fully vaccinated. chances catching already extremely low. Even catch it, chances anything cold-like symptoms even lower. fine. afraid catching cold flu every time stepped house past? Aahhhh, nothing says freedom government like government issuing executive orders preventing local governments make choices. fuck writes three-fourths Username .. check out? pro life aka sickness. It’s terrifying people getting confused public decency anymore.

The situation walks take step back, take step closer, take another step back. Let’s say said distasteful things overacting.

I don’t remember nose nose someone even shoulder shoulder talking. It’s steps away someone usually.

Unfortunate say, think misinformation spreading around people forgetting things.

Just remember, dont want take precautions doesn’t mean person  pandemics end, type mentality going stress out. We're 1.5 years global pandemic, and, historically, pandemics end around 2-3 years. developed countries vaccines, pandemic probably ""end"" sooner less developed countries. vaccines still effective, still need keep pushing those.

The absolute worst option walk away let virus burn population. can't happen, given amount deaths strain health care businesses. Even still, ct/viral load stat needs big caveat - data people AZ vaccinations. mrna vaccinations. Sending patients town happening southern Missouri. Branson hospital maxed COVID-19 patients, doctors contacted dozen hospitals corners state. capacity. Lake Regional nearly full, too, Dr. Joe Sohal, pulmonologist critical care specialist, found bed Barker.

That's two hour drive. hospitalization they're talking happened three weeks guys protesting Gov Whitmer executive overreach? ...crickets well said point way stop variants give vaccinated prune sticks. thought practice entire pandemic vaccinated get cold basically

Not quite. ranges asymptomatic really bad flu knocks week. gonna hospitalize you, need worry go ER. Oh shit comitted killing many Rs possible. What’s difference vs transmissible infectious? people I.C.U. Covid denying Covid,” said Dr. Matthew Sperry, pulmonary critical care physician treating Mr. Greene. “It doesn’t matter say.”

It's impossible reason people like that, quite number seems. mind boggling Ok, hypothetically speaking, federal government passing law prohibiting governors issuing executive order? ok it? perfect according mr reasoning. sister law nurse ICU. says they’re seeing lot young people children hospitalized delta variant. simply care weak, aside children (elderly, co-morbidities, etc). vocal minority Reddit, actions speak louder words - case, message clear. nation, care minor percentage us die long personally inconvenienced. Florida texas wants title too! got tested Wednesday abundance caution; I’d large wedding 20+ states attendance, symptoms mirrored cold like symptoms breakthrough cases. Unfortunately, mine breakthrough. Curious many discovered. I’m AD service member. I’m pretty sure know I’m talking lmao. marxism

Hahah Mark Levine moron took money fed bunch bullshit. sad, least Saban recognizes influence pretty good dude it. There's far worse people could position instead. insinuation original poster's tone absolutely means people ample opportunity not. people vaccinated can't yet due measures outside control. This. black panthers exercised second amendment founding fathers intended used, NRA supported governor California Ronald Reagan passing strictest gun laws country. kids work/attend school. safety measures last year.. plexiglass, temperature checks, distancing, etc. wife said plexiglass still campus, can't use it. distancing classrooms. health/temp checks.. kids feel good running fever go back class.. beyond reckless criminal stage point. Retail workers go work sick can't afford miss payday. can't afford fired downscheduled unreliability. want go homeless.

Think next time supermarket mall fast food outlet. Spread variants never quashed, right still outstanding challenges fixed eventually:

1. lack understanding long term effects covid. eventually know more, right getting Covid still rolling dice unspecified amount damage one’s long term health. still don’t know vaccines eliminate risk.

2. lack early effective treatments antivirals. Also part “rolling dice” thing. Whatever covid inside body, think want way stop rapidly soon possible. don’t yet.

I see lots “if now, when?” reasoning regards moving socially psychologically pandemic, it’s train thought correct. think it’s incorrect apply time, actually think literally aren’t yet. “there” get it, it’s now.  need see data. 

The one study cited presentation doctors got AZ, mrna. paper shows mrna much better delta AZ. 

So show viral loads fully mrna vaccinated people get breakthrough infections alpha vs delta. make informed decisions. Wow. Fuck Abbott. “If information today would gotten vaccinated,” Ms. Greene wrote. Come may, hit “send.”



I mean information, chose ignore Facebook. couple nurse friends they've said number vaccinated people requiring hospitalization seems really low.

I hate vague words like ""alarming amount"" ""really low"" could mean number - interpretation. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

After test done get positive/negative result, swab sent lab genetic testing determine variant.

I believe Delta diagnoses based symptoms (as Delta symptoms slightly different symptoms variants). both? mean, disagree approaches point. forced mandates, forcing lack mandates. It’s overreach either way vaccines available. surprise slightest Well noticed lot people lying people sub particular (maybe thread much) idea vaccine meant couldn’t get infected spread virus knew wasn’t case months ago.

The vaccine always portrayed science community offering personal protection severe cases/symptoms super significant effect spread/infection. absolutely insane watch people react harshly reality known since vaccine around really. LAST!! Alabama FINALLY #1 state nation something! Hospitals required masks/vaccination employment long remember flu season COVID. going fine hospitals continuing practice? idiot.

If ER broken arm might get treated ahead bank robber came multiple gunshot wounds but... That's works. 

If non-life-threatening injury, they're always going treat life-threatening injured person first. Always have, always will. That's like see, leaders indomitable fighting spirit comes nemesis, Covid! 


...er, what, say, leaders fighting side Covid? Oh, never mind.  always Alabama... Yep, US basically unlimited supplies, UK bit constrained front seen demand (cos fewer anti-vaxxers).

Both nations seem finding new people vax, current one dose figures (69% 57%) probably increase much .... unless there's vaccination younger age groups, happening Canada several European nations. house freeze winter kill brain cells? blood hands. GOP obviously evil point Voila American Read comments questions best posed doctor. read it, Provincetown data using base party town closed tightly packed spreading event situation.

And say spread infected.

As long taking part types events probably makes huge difference get infected? (Edit Iceland Singapore seeing high infection rate clubs) 

Nightclubs crowded bars - Bad

Grocery stores - bad originally were.   Talk doctor concerned Read comments able run reelection hell drug. odds still lowered. efficacy still range expect vaccines in. efficacy numbers insanely good, people calibrated right. live well-vaccinated liberal small city, popped one ""play safe"" coffee shops morning. still indoor seating, took long time stop asking people wear masks, thought might quick backtrack. no, staff mostly unmasked, well customers. I'm pretty pleased that, pretty surprised. county CDC's list significant spread, expected little panic here. much. starting think breakthrough infections occurring frequently. 74% would crazy... think even 25% cases vaccinated would set us back lot... biggest concern unvaccinated kid spreading myself. Breakthrough cases rare enough concerned. media/Reddit reports every single one good indicator real world.

I don’t know. I’m vaccinated. friends family are. I’m living normal life something extremely different tells otherwise.  Rewarding people immature, belligerent assholes - time alive. that? mother immunocompromised ventilator. told yesterday requested another shot, doctors refused boosters approved emergency use yet. New York City, USA.

She really needs booster gotten. immunocompromised vastly diminished lung function. people going clubbing Netherlands June 26 would fully vaccinated though. example, I'm 31 receive second dose Pfizer next week considered fully vaccinated mid-August. imagine people going clubbing younger me, probably add week two would fully vaccinated two dose vaccine. 

The Dutch government promoted 'Dansen met Janssen' would considered fully vaccinated could go clubbing day receiving vaccine. vaccinated yet, could take lateral flow test (and plenty issues carried well).

We need shame people exact thing government told okay (but view poor decision government). mean people unable work weeks/dying droves unwillingness people go brick mortar ruining every business. What.. Dumb fucking statement. course Right agree. think become regional sporadic western/wealthy world. hopefully point sooner rather later focus effort vaccinating developing nations quicker. That's significant reduction 95%. Vaxxed people need socially distance wear masks next 6-10 weeks least. need lockdowns Serious: 
1. list comorbidities/sicknesses people, put high risk injected vaccine? list medical reasons person can't vaccinated.

2. vaccines safe use people history thrombosis? saying expect 1.2 million infections weekly, peak 1.2 million infections week August 21? year definitely sucked part restrictions I'm New York felt hard. Really bugs they're talking potentially restrictions need work.

My family social circle really fortunate last year us exposed covid. know one person absolutely fine (was pregnant time also older). got worse pandemic (we still went could) us vaccinated.

It's also real frustrating people follow guidelines ones paying attention getting vaccinated. many people allowed get vaccine refuse, suddenly comply another mask mandate?

We've year half messaging still sucks. I'm point I'm saying ""fuck it, I'm going what's best me."" I'm inclined wear mask indoors shop I'm worried getting ill delta testing positive test able work weeks.

A years ago read 'And Band Plays On' AIDS outbreak 70s 80s government society bungled that. It'll real interesting read debriefs mistakes happened covid ever fucking ends. hope something dumb like likely catch hydrated enough. point, close 90% new cases Delta, assume AYOO First dose - unable work day

Second dose - unable work three days 

Third dose (booster) - unable work week? Yeah perpetually make virus cycle instead wearing masks. idiots don’t understand small businesses work /s type without wearing N95?! everyone thread exposed Texas sized small government Vaccines never able stop catching virus."" true! depends virus. many viruses, vaccines provide ""sterilizing immunity"" prevents disease first place. vaccines chicken pox, small pox (I presume), polio, hepatitis B, etc... prevent infection entirely. true Covid vaccines well (esp mRNA vaccines) original virus. Hopefully true mRNA tweaked better target variants.

""It stand reason virus spreads ""as easily vaccinated population"" - hope right this, I'm guessing are, article saying.

edit: typos source Australia story? would like know details happened bc shit scary. im fine masking indoors needed (im vax'ed live numbers climbing horrible yet) nice finally get see people, obv summer nice hang outside without avoid people (crossing streets, making tons extra room, etc). 

&amp;#x200B;

also fact we're going entirely backwards (masks back indoors everyone, recommendations mask outside), gonna tough get people back board again. timeline sucks. Every vaccine patent needs released copied domestic generics, inhumane poor countries. Fuck private pharmaceutical companies Right agree. think become regional sporadic western/wealthy world. hopefully point sooner rather later focus effort vaccinating developing nations quicker. youngest ineligible time. Also baby due October. fucked . *Every* business? Every single business planet? That's objectively false.

You sure sound like know lot business. share credentials? swear disgusted no-vax communities many newspapers country. Extreme cover people dead vaccine autopsy administered, even cases borrowed USA unconfirmed (if totally fake) ""news"", clickbait articles vaccines, de-contextualized Fauci claims (a lot of, lastly ""vaccinated individuals contagious unvaccinated"" articles' titles, forgetting Fauci also acknowledged vaccinated even get positive), etc..

And newspapers pushing anti-vax propaganda, also share news kids unvaccinated elders dying COVID. shamelessly milking money clickbait either ads commonly paywalled articles. publishable trash published relentlessly.

People follow news also Facebook obviously confused exposed many ""realities"" anger grows. Facebook really bad job letting anti-vax communities build grow, I'm mad many journalists careless year far award clicks probably would mitigate collapsing hospital system covid people. won’t mitigate outbreak still outbreaks flu cold. Yeah bought 12 things Lysol wipes, 4 things hand sanitizer wipes, 4 big things hand sanitizer Lysol sprays donate kids classes. also got mine individual wrapped masks toss home end day. might double mask stock masks school decide mask. homeschooled last year taking toll us mentally. moved kids really lonely super hard. call therapist get perspective. keep going back forth need mentally I. Actually yesterday stopped requiring COVID positive people isolate/quarantine, aren’t requiring close contacts positive cases isolate/quarantine, aren’t contact tracing, aren’t offering asymptomatic testing.

It’s going great /s Wahlah? studies around this? vaccines protect symptomatic infection level 85% more. That’s damn good. longer wait harder gonna be. Small changes next decade pay big time. understand. I'm saying thats argument ""I paid student loans, irresponsible people get break? get reimbursed paid then""

Be happy got vaccine move on. said, $100 go far anyways People want data. is. disease infectious covid measles. universal masking reduce spread. read that?   17x number definitely misleading; however, describing absolutely spreading disease.

Vaccinated people likely spread covid unvaccinated people, *if get breakthrough infection.*. vaccine still ~75-85% effective those, per CDC. Found idiot Yeah exactly. Stupid idea rules ""no edited titles"" 

The headline ""Facebook News Consumers Anti-Vaccine Fox News Viewers, Study Finds"" read found phrasing confusing luck, future waves fill hospitals patients, cause nearly much concern! Nuke place Lysol orbit. way sure. Maybe vaccines meant anti-vaxxers States sent Australia countries vaccine hard get. people critique paragraph realize poorly written. really unclear actually numbers status are. myopic areas life? kind puts perspective priorities sharing vaccines progress worldwide. South Africa like 6% vaccine coverage total. Africa overall 1.5 think? still factor Natural immunity infection kind barrier. developing nations pose far threat current issue within borders. Let dog shit backyard, pick wearing underwear. So, 50/50.

Seriously, though - 50/50, depends politics, apparently. I’m fucking terrified toddler affects people around them, still apply considered appropriate response? Shocked faces abound. Unless businesses receive state funding unless business receiving state funding nursing home living facility.

Yes, put confusing possible way purpose.

More clearly:

Nursing homes: Always allowed require vaccinations.

Private Businesses: allowed require masks/vaccines receive state funding.

Now, know ""receive state funding"" means. assume I'm government contractor contract state would count. allow people pay SNAP/EBT cards? accept Medicaid patients? things also count ""state funding?"" African Americans historically trust government group used political weapons decades. I’m surprised. algorithm Facebook pretty horrid. heard parents watching video FB day vaccines used global conspiracy combat overpopulation killing people off. joke there’s idiots believe shit.  use surprised pikachu face, right? It’s principle it. reward idiots assholes prolonging pandemic making lives healthcare workers hell? I’m fucking tired us revolving around them. I’d like see workplaces firing antivaxxers health insurance refusing coverage. Enough. It’s loooong time. wasn’t easily visible public. “War drugs”, anti-abortion, support oil &amp; gas literally contributing climate change, etc…do remember Tr*mp wanted bring back coal? 21st century scientists warning us climate change wanted bring back coal!!! think heard there's something like 12 states sort prohibition local governments and/or businesses requiring masks and/or vaccines. Crazy! it! First covid, last education! two things probably unrelated... (unlike wives) one big family there. one. breakdown per vaccine type? cycle pleading:

1) Doctors/politicians plead residents get vaccinated.

2) Hospitalized residents plead doctors get vaccinated.

Rinse repeat.  Disallow insurance coverage. Since mix-and-match officially studied accepted WHO, countries businesses (like US cruise lines) treat people mix-and-max vaccines unvaccinated people. Canadian went Barbados vacation month two ago found arrival required unvaccinated person, Canadians finding eligible 'vaccinated-only' US cruises booked. posted small rant days ago company enforcing masks unvaccinated people using ""the honor system"" instead. pretty low percentage coworkers actually vaccinated (-_-).

Welp.

They big company event Monday, tons people packed tent ""outside"" nobody masked. go, livestream watch. 

Tuesday got email somebody tested positive.

Today got email office shut indefinitely people symptoms.

And coworkers like ""wowwww could happen? odds???"" I'm like............ yay home-grown super spreader event.

Sad thing work lot older people (who vaccinated). really hope get thru outbreak without deaths. Nah, I’m Ontario, Canada testing available walk-ins pharmacies. got fast test girlfriend clear minds, even sick.

Our positivity rate 0.8%.

Don’t fool yourself, it’s really really bad. completely understand. risks vaccine. risks minimal age groups really well virus. much discrepancy risk benefits. Thus unknown possible long term side effects someone could 70+ years life left something consider. child 12 correct dosage needs determined think currently studying that. weighing long covid know breakthrough cases showing symptoms long covid. Without data difficult know impact decision. Given increased transmissibility Delta mean cloth masks likely effective? people wearing N95s? That's fucking awesome. husband get tested last week got sick someone work. faced, 18 month old not. find test days. buy home one. kid got sick tale dr. Thankfully, covid, since coworker refused testing....well...we make sure. data right-hand side [this shows cloth FC (face covering) prevent getting infectious dose 33 hours 20 minutes based infected person wearing.

Thats based person within 6 feet infected whole time.

That document appears created May Delta really boomed I'd say there's less protection now. Especially given time get infectious dose Delta seems much lower.

So answer question - dont think Delta specific study there. N95 seem way go.  Actually many people fully vaccinated. That's also large part problem. Dutch government promoted getting Jansen vaccine going club evening, despite lot evidence need least 2 weeks immunity form. top also people sending QR code friends tested all, though one falls club security checking properly people's IDs. 75% unvaccinated

I'm thinking children, willingly unvaccinated want protection.  study recently healthcare setting showed 15% breakthrough cases symptoms lasting weeks. sure type 'normal' long Covid, happening. Thankfully 15% total number symptomatic breakthrough cases still fairly low (something like .53% remember math thread correctly) time Except Texans. week’s national ensemble predicts number newly reported COVID-19 cases likey increase next 4 weeks, 200,000 1,200,000 new cases likely reported week ending August 21, 2021. covid penises? Since I'm vaccinated told load lower taking zinc, pineapple juice, drinking lots water. still chance killed falling fragment space debris second leave house. So..? 


I mean chances miniscule really, point, wanted shot already got it. least euroatlantic area. 33 got second shot month ago. cant sit home forever fearing every single positive PCR test happens fly around. interesting Reminds shameless episode rob truck contaminated meat, army comes lock area. 

Only time fucking real.

Stay home folks, stay safe. Perpetual closing /= banning mask mandates vaccine requirements. Advent Health COVID-19 hospitalizations right time since began. Bets week’s number? averaging 10,500 day last week weekly number complete. I’d say weekly number least 100,000 July 23-30. Atlanta oasis blue sea blood red. Zero chance anybody putting masks back state anywhere outside 285 perimeter.

(Ok maybe handful Athens, Macon, various smaller cities) Wasn’t case Australia contact tracing discovered person infected someone walking past outside store? missing key feature vaccines analysis here: reduction severity. COVID Rt 1.6 unvaccinated population definitely bad news, COVID Rt population overwhelmingly protected severe disease simply big deal. common cold's Rt 2-3 give second thought. 

I'm saying still threatening some, influenza catch pages influenza news every day flu season (although personally would love see courtesy masking cold flu season young people getting flu shot.) 

I think lot vaccinated people reading alarming sounding numbers vastly overestimating personal risk covid. lot vaccinated cases we're finding people felt sick, they're people get tested routinely work otherwise would idea even carrying virus. point young, healthy, vaccinated many things worry present risk covid. meaning relation death rate. ton people catch cold every year.

Postive meaningless own.

Hospitalization meaningful

Death rate meaningful.

People fever, much. Well, go official statistics, either way, 1.4 billion people, need keep mind evaluating numbers. That's 4x US population 20x UK population. thats sad stuff mean need shut society 1. No, thing higher risk side effects vaccine. medical contraindication Covid vaccine, history severe immediate allergic reaction one components. extremely rare case, get different vaccine. 
2. Yes. point, yes. limit government people limiting help citizens limiting taxes paid rich.

They care you’re born you’re top 5% wealth. Voilà Pfizer costs roughly 7-10 times AZ Indian vaccine. 2-3 x Sputnik. Pfizer Moderna arent going selling developing world vast numbers. slight overlap markets. Mmmm exactly.

Mississippi Massachusetts may vastly different vaccine uptakes, reasons explain different underlying trends (e.g., different uptakes according party affiliation, ethnicity, income etc.) still apply state give insights drive policy. apply Denmark Bulgaria - they're completely different worlds. nah That's get viral load local Wal-Mart closed tomorrow. 40 employees it.

They're removing everything sanitize every inch. headline article. article also clearly says armed. quite interesting data different, comparing example UK Canada. compute delta. indicate virus reason, instead different circumstances (i.e. Vaccine = UK uses PZ lot, interval doses, UK used 12 weeks long period time, etc. etc.) 

Hospitalization also difficult. countries (US) hospital paid mark patient COVID insurance, UK healthcare free. 

All know know enough CDC want recommend mask (They tool toolbox) to. country follow science imho. much free market deciding go business. 

What pandering moron. 2 yo really well mask yesterday. post somewhere. worried, well, still likes “school” (daycare) Yet one payin attention this:
[Still 88% effective systematic Terrorist data passed around yesterday.

One thing realize contagiousness graph x-axis R, R new strain estimated 5-9, insane, especially 4-day incubation period. R value 8, four weeks, two million people infected. Two weeks later, billion people, course nonsense, we're one giant tight space spreading virus other. suggest extremely rapid flare outbreak, countries shown people predicting. Maybe ""We're much outbreak realize"" crowd proven correct! Vaccine never designed prevent infection, prevent disease could said something RNC gave followers permission vax. left. love memories Texas, grateful gone current mess. Holy shit. Well, back ordering pizza house. removed lockdown went Trumpian styles getting 0% straw poll among GOP congressmen they’d support President anyone wants see, numbers, Alabama trash state: [Why it’s worst state Real world efficacy lower depending age, amount exposure, factors. CDC puts 75-85% recent knew body count would next Republican primary scoreboard? Yes, fucked badly, gave CEO huge bonus reward that. Go figure. very, recently, adenovirus vaccine military members get IET conditional approval limited use military only. vaccine used span 4 decades (with break struggled find manufacturer it). Ok, thanks doctor. I’ll let real doctor know since recommended it. Still, ease Delta variant passes one person another caught public health experts surprise.

Sort states deaths per capita still liberal states Northeast done worst pandemic whole.  Build wall around AL. way sure. Pretty darn rare. know, *are* counted.

As last week, [153k symptomatic breakthrough cases since vaccines started tested. (0.098% vacci


Now compare [1,224k cases general population last 30 days. Here's presentation:
  
The takeaway infections vaccinated people (which still rarer unvaccinated) contagious. even symptomatic breakthrough cases, relatively rare may be, far away mild.
 
The actual *threat* still unvaccinated population, can't count rest us buffer virus them. rest us asked mask behalf -- least workplace. inverse scenario bunch different countries world would vaccination campaigns entirely run completely disconnected wildly different borders.

No one ever grouped bunch different countries together though. severe cases India remember procure thr industrial grade oxygen concentrators. Upwards 15 L/min Right sitting plastic swimming pool full hand sanitizer wearing N69, I'm wearing two condoms (can't forget wrap balls too). 

I mean can't careful Delta Airlines variant else never able redeem SkyMiles. Brb gonna share Facebook. It’s article basically explains can’t always explain everything Covid cases rise fall one place another. try explanations ranging weather vaccination rates various policy interventions, sometimes don’t seem sufficient sound perfect one place another (like late summer arrival could explain recent drop cases UK similar drop India).

One thing discusses comment doesn’t mention alpha wave US localized Michigan Minnesota lesser extent. Usually outbreaks start one place spread far states much fewer restrictions time.  Still, ease Delta variant passes one person another caught public health experts surprise.

Sonder vs Solipsisim Suprise?

Not rly... smartest people state. Spreadnecks. Yeah 6 months NYC IRL Death Stranding. LMAO! Already changing. know it, we'll back lockdowns. thanks. I'm vaccinated data suggests equal chance severe illness death compared refuse vaccination.

Before anyone comments, kids?! went counties fair couple nights ago. kids 12 wearing masks. They'll okay. I'm sure love common breakthroughs show negative aPCR test? know nature still uncertain false negative factor also interesting. Yeah…are actually doctor/nurse? Nothing you’ve said accurate. someone need oxygen need oxygen? intubated patient placed medically induced coma actually press call button, know, they’re coma. Unless point you’re sedating intubated patients…which isn’t happening. virus lucky there's many stupid people humanity flat refuse measures could wipe everyone kids pandemic. insane. dont care us :( mean…it sucks took I’ll take it.  Party small government tells governments govern. wear seatbelts? Right? number toxic douchebags downvoting honest discussion sub mindblowing. Seriously desperate creepy.  Given that, according CDC, lifetime risk gay/bi men HIV infection 1 6, could subset gay men HIV skewing breakthrough cases?

I'm sure HIV would count immunocompromised, untreated HIV, purposes antibody titers/white blood cells.  Abbott sides COVID US's war COVID  medical experience. nurse practitioner wife myriad experience education however. Although even knows listen scientists corresponding fields appropriate expertise. 

Again, two different numbers, statistical anomaly. easiest effective place enforce workplace. Sending vaccine records HR one time logistically lot easier checking vaccine status door public facing business every time walk place. dont know long term consequences things. microplastic use seemingly everything, found almost every living person, linked plummeting fertility rates. knows else use everyday thats horrible us.

take steps protect yourself, worrying beyond probably going make big difference one way other. Isn’t 1141 deaths still worrying number, many total deaths time ?? party small government Seriously, wrong fucking asshole? goal? piece shit state go bankrupt medical problems? Kill half population?

Fuck Abbott fuck texas politicians

Sincerely, 

a fucking pissed-off texan Get covid get vaccine. want hide woods hermit rest life avoid covid go ahead. Unfortunately know people like haven’t left house except essentials 18 months fear repercussions lifestyle choice longer term effects. Last person know drank death 41......I'm leaving trades 45 broke broken. Pretty sure Abbot terrorist whose infiltrated government like many right. Never late told husband today masks store live upstate NY seems like COVID-19 barely thing ended year ago I'm talking 2020 far larger worse one normal. testing even verify flu time, assumed. year basically flu season though nationally Hopefully year idiots dead. knew virus would get much support? Ask different way, bro. Brawndo plants crave!!! really think he’s idiot, he’s highly educated idiot, great deal political ambition.  Possible. ED. Limp pee pee I’m Texan. Trust say stupid. He’s new kind stupid. qualify “religious exception” claim whatever want part religion created mind two minutes ago?

I wonder deadly COVID become people take seriously.

I’m looking various articles could wouldn’t huge deal everyone fucking vaccinated need stop spread, need stop something puts people hospital. You’re anti masker? makes much sense now. Enjoy FrEeDoM, stuff worried rando calling hypocrite. Mask get covid, it’s proven time time again.

Have FANTASTIC day! Great news! Texas almost blue, 3rd wave could turn blue. Lol laughed immediate reaction ""oh phew.""  people talk say “ya it’s 600k it’s mostly old fat.” absolutely blows mind. Like totally okay Wyoming sized population dying, long 50 fat? Jesus. science says vaccine protects well even delta variant?

It offers useful degree protection, yes.

But enough protection areas overall prevalence pumped large unvaccinated population.

At present, vaccination one number tools best layered combination; ""the answer"" near total.

Especially globally never - hope would locality, vaccination rates high enough ""travel cases"" usually fizzle infecting breakthrough cases, rather sparking explosion substantial unvaccinated population. thought digging I'm sure bad situation. resort town thousands people likely liberal highly vaccinated. smaller amount unvaccinated cases might due fact WAY less them. Thanks! I’m literally doctor one states listed. It’s bad here, you’re describing collapse health care system aren’t (and never been) close Seriously. We're still 250-300 deaths per day entire country. one deaths tragic, yes, that's type number force everyone upend lives again. threat another mass casualty event like saw March 2020 last winter exist anymore. Even CDC starting come around inevitability humanity needs learn live freak time variant comes around. likely. Living loving Texas getting embarrassing. also look age. Elders risk Florida oldest state California among youngest. get coronavirus news Reddit. Lolwhat Yeah you… ready accept life expectancy reduced twenty years, please let us live. vaccinated willl masks enclosed spaces, please don’t shut down..  There's lot irony contradictions statement... mandates mandates? Words cheap. Let's see actual efforts That's is. Restriction lockdowns return hospitals fill up. sucks, options there? Hospitals fundamental pillar society.

The best hope people hesitant, flock get vaccine reaction hospitals filling up. really gonna take thing hitting home numbers start moving again. Omg wtf wrong people?!?? Yeah, misread it. Thanks sorry! definitely win allies.......hard/s That's averages work though... spike show rolling average, spike - normal fluctuation. true spike happening, show weekly averages. Daily numbers noise nature. defending releasing weekly reports instead daily, can't hide spike using weekly average. I've experienced pandemic Singapore mask mandate indoors outdoors norm law carries severe punishment. People issues complying it. makes everyone around safer (vaccinated not) allowed life resume almost normal LITTLE FEAR anxiety.

People US opposed masking (even non political reasons) calling uncomfortable, anxiety inducing, etc. find ridiculous wearing mask induces anxiety knowing protection?? everyone would mask get rest population vaccinated one way another, anxiety level would lower whole. People selfish ignorant what's causing current spike. Yes part getting vaccinated. keep wearing mask end year pound chests like Pfizer superman. Aargh. know that's true, want think it.  I’m worried tourism. Im afraid virus all. personally think masks need gone. I’m tired people high horses judging state willfully walking right fire taking risk picking spreading it. Again. PART SPREAD. QUIT ACTING LIKE YOURE REASONS JUSTIFIED! hypocrite. parents actually going send kids dangerous environment like that? Specifically 12? sure wouldn't. people care kids, either. get downvoted comments straight removed respond people's comments stating going maskless care (either anti vaxx tired anti vaxxers ""did part"" getting vaccinated it). Kids getting really sick right now. special needs son high risk. able ""ease back normal"" like everyone else around us has. still old day day out, home time unable see anyone. see dark tunnel end sight. depressing. Yes, vaccinated people become infected delta carry high viral load transmit virus others efficiently, unfortunately. Hilarious, example government telling people can’t do. Pull head out, bro. 
Clearly vaccines alone great plan Delta coming. Delta here, time admit bad plan change it. smokers fat people diabetics whoever else want put group falling ill time.

They are. literally, every single day. 

If things get bad, hospitals triage treatment. get wish youll start seeing people get turned away. except wont based vaccination status, itll strict ""most likely survive treatment"" elect him? He's banning mask. wish wear mask wear one. He's simply preventing government forcing so. Oh. I’m idiot. read 175k dragging feet making vaccine accessible lower income areas seriously ill directly responsible aunt currently dealing organ failure uncontrolled diabetes. 65 cut doctors trying get dose approved her, hospital even enough doses staff. One county over, issue. Guess county typically votes? Spicy sub says pandemic agree stipulations. vaccinated, expect health care contract covid. unable vaccinated healthcare physician recommend it, young, maybe young anti-vax parents, exceptions. Otherwise, resources spent individuals way lessen symptoms almost completely avoid them?  


I'm also open taxes. Vaccinated individuals tax deductions weigh resources needed less. Un-vaccinated individuals taxed % wealth. (Investments, income, assets, etc.) static amount, becomes fee rich burdens poor. make % based entire wealth increase % higher wealth becomes. sure, vaccinated get medical assistance. He’s says, open carrying hand cannon “just case” feels like it’s already here, extent. Well half marriages US end divorce, maybe one half parents vaccinate children. one talking eradication, talking reasonable measures. 

You head sand day like won’t change facts. That's key guidance local trends, individual feelings comment waiting for. tf racist didn’t even mention single race, also article 6 months ago it’s accurate anymore Ahhh, that’s good know. That’s certainly dogma, it’s proof. Proof would testing post-vaccine human signs DNA integration. That’s part study. Okay, percentage population vaccinated? average 11 deaths per day, many kids, adults, seniors, vaxed unvaxed? thing statistics good reference point also miss represented fit nearly naritive good bad. I'd curious see deaths compared unvaxed deaths per vaxed county get better measure what's going on. God dammit hate fucking man craven assholes anything stay power, even kill constituents supporters. Disgusting. Sorry constant responses find study really interesting. I'm part LGBT community Provincetown gay resort town matches following statement CDC report fact 85% infections men.

THIS ANTI LGBT POST could explain shocking numbers here. 

**.....demographics cases likely reflect attendees public gatherings, events marketed adult male participants.** Thank you. course comment buried bottom thread. Working conditions suck US. high salary jobs difficult get often demanding. surprising many people try chase way living make miserable, famous social media personality 100% easy negative sides compared many jobs still better. 

But combat many young people going direction, need constantly reminded small likelihood success much requires luck right connections. also pursue realistic career path trying get famous side opposed putting eggs, most, basket trying get famous. even worse 70% rate included single dose. Per-capita sensible way look sort data, California twice population Florida. 
Also cases always lead hospitalizations turn lead deaths. deaths July upswing won’t seen next month. 
Luckily, expect lower ratio hospitalizations deaths new cases go-around. Even states poor overall vaccine coverage still pretty good chunk seniors vaccinated. 1 250 could statistically easily 2, 0. number hospitalizations low really statistically significant.

What normal percentage unvaccinated end hospital? cannot possibly low 0.4% still are, district get funding it, pay themselves, least one choosing too. school district Austin choosing offer online pay themselves. Idiotic solutions towards idiotic antivaxxers. Sounds fine me. hadn’t seen flu stats. Maryland barely flu masks social distancing closed schools.  Woo hoo! /s abuse power? Oh yea, sorry, offering opinion. Forgot Tam. Agreed, don’t know sure. would pretty shocked 75% fully vaccinated though. Thanks useful website, risk people vaccinated. Majority unvaccinated people younger lower risk hospitalization. Also, LA county huge virus may spread yet less vaccinated communities don’t data that. Lastly, without vaccinations number hospitalized pts would much higher.    article correct, bit tricky: ""Abbott's order applies government entities receiving state funds, including counties, cities, school districts, public health authorities government officials."" technically going depend clinic run, could county public health clinic. According 10% Texas 18 (so age 12-18) fully vaccinated locally transmitted cases well kept control while.  Ive trying get answer reddit's new ""libertarian"" groups ah right, 1 1000 side effects, 1/10,000 serious side effect.  clear question relevant discussion. Thank much compassion. husband fully vaxxed live Houston area. pandemic hit, husband quit job (I higher wage earner best option) massively changed lifestyle could afford keep kids school virtually. essentially stayed inside home last 16 months main one go necessary. far, 4 us managed become infected. option taken away district offering virtual year, can’t afford stay one income much longer.

Our daughter 8 son, severe autism non-verbal, 4. start school August 11…without mask mandate place. fairly confident daughter keep mask throughout school day, never able get son wear mask.

Hey Governor Abbott, please give advice explain “personal responsibility” son wear mask school around dozens unmasked, unvaccinated students adults? desperate signed kids pediatric vaccine trials, far neither selected. terrified don’t know do. doubt. Try sending kid school lice.  Go Crimson Tide!

U-S-A!

U-S-A!

U-S-A! seems pro Summer 2021 lockdown crowd 3 talking points easily refuted. 

(A) KIdS? 400 kids America died Covid time. That's less typical flu season 3x time. either assume risk choose isolate family, whichever best them.

(B) people legitimately can't get vaccinated. I'm sorry, need isolate themselves. Society can't permanently shutdown sake people could easily protect isolating pickup groceries. can't afford it, government assistance provided. tbh really think many people exagerrate many people can't get vaccinated. 

(C) cases HIGH? cares.... believe 1,000 162,000,000 vaccinated people died. That's really strong proof vaccines work. deaths better metric cases. Unless someone category b, they're protected. aren't, protected decided they'd rather risk Covid get shot, smart, choice. 

No lockdowns unless something drastically changes. ""overreach gov"" ""mandate"" NPI's record, case anyone quite notice, made subjective assessments whether agree disagree this.

You need :) Maybe file lawsuit states ability make us wear seatbelts car, shoes public building, pants underwear public street, shirt church.

So pfizer vaccines tested positive lower rate vaccines put arms. Jennsen likely test positive moderna equal. mean thats read it.  Depends are.

Texas Florida literally banned Arkansas teachers are. support ... school. She’s tried nothing she’s ideas   Yeah, good thread, think measured people assume responses here. acknowledges good bad things happening. Following spirit post, panic, take adequate precautions.  Yep. want control women's reproductive autonomy. Yea agree. Seems pictures huge party. 40000 people there? 300 cases Vacc'd 100 unvacc'd seem major issue. don’t take 5 label says “take 1 bedtime.”

If label says take 1 every 6 months, might. 

Or don't, run risk getting COVID accordingly. Now, medical knowledge, take massive grain salt. Could variant Delta maybe identified yet? ""Pro Life"" Looking percentage whole population meaningful, entire population exposed. would much better look vaccinated vs. unvaccinated areas high daily cases. think message reopen, need increase uptake amongst vaccine hesitant. event proactive possible new information require adaptation since already acting accordingly. see reflected Israel’s upcoming outperformance US, since former already administering booster shots latter going wait adapt upon becoming informed.

Also caught flu vaccination. Bro what.. didn’t think real people believed chip 5g thing. thought meme problem CDC really know.

Sc governor McMaster banned mask mandates took plexiglass paid millions going federal bus mask mandates .But he’s trying ban abortions cares lives. like gives flying fuck. people neighborhood still suffering power/plumbing/housing issues Texas freeze chose line pockets golf buddies whatever. 

but yeah, let’s take away woman’s right choose what’s best body continue pretend corona made disease doesn’t hurt anyone. 

I love state also hate GD stupid leadership is. blatant disregard humanity ≠ freedom.  still goes initial data vaccine 98-99% effective preventing hospitalization. significant piece information amount virus vaccinated person carries Delta variant versus variants. virus best friend Republican Party. see two sides that. Scientists willing use real names also get death threats angry letters employers. Paul Offit stories that’ll blow hair back. try evaluate based quality information instead. statistically speaking words paper crap reason trend Republican governors actively squash attempts protect people Covid. Whether schoolkids required wear masks entirely different debate, literally ban protective measures way overkill opinion. Man dick hand must feel good think okay buddeh. info whether risk factors/ comorbidities?  increase RSV something covid right? sounds awful. Please take care best can.  sole purposes Republican Party increase corporate power protect wealth already rich. Everything else trick uneducated poor people voting them. Again, know that.

This skewed population. Predominately gay men, skew liberal, skew urban, reasonably higher proportion vaccinations general population. 

This study answer question efficacy. show breakthroughs possible, lead symptoms.  know good news, 10% really high. older younger mind asking?   Yeah, I'll damned I'm going behind curve walmart. I'm vaccinated, I'm going start wearing mask today. Fuck risking shit. love grandpa much miss time like grandma covid took her.

Be careful people. tell loved ones love them. non-cancer news website read this?  I'm curious one brings prior immunity. studies sides prior immunity vs vaccination appear, sum them, relatively close best combo would go lot smoother start proof prior infection included. find odd one talks it. understand can't forever boosters start thing natural immunity prior infection literally talked where. Like exist all. hate right that. going happen. amount people sticking rhetoric green energy failed astounding. That's Idaho. Governor state conference like... single day, Lt.

Governor came back next day tossed order garbage said cities make decision. subreddit. local sub. believe CDC verbiage currently masks recommended indoors areas high new cases positive test result ratios. Whether vaccinated not. There's map areas danger zone changes weekly conservative approach assume need habit eventually may well start now. 

The new internal CDC document says Delta variant one transmissible viruses known. spreading throughout population rapidly likely saturate population rapidly. information risk maps might timely enough provide adequate warning mask better safe side.

Masks, even KN95 respirators, available designer colors fashion prints dollar. breathe easily, respirators protect others. costly inconvenient compared downside risk.  Oh, wow - pretty interesting. Compare Israel planning give 3rd Pfizer booster Turkey giving double Sinovacced people Pfizer improve effectiveness. Also many countries Europe mixing due concerns AZ (so AZ followed mRNA). Given studies show mix great, nice approved  sister got kindergarten, 4 thankfully barely remember it, yeah it. probably ask doctor there's antibody test and/or reason _not_ take vaccine even though it. I've enough skin issues life want part shingles, literally learned vaccine existed thread want book doctor's appointment right Florida lol AJAB  almost exactly thinking weeks ago. vote put different GOPer nothing change. Greg Abbott pro covid anti walking Athis first big ""new"" vaccine generation. counting flunvarients. antivax movement rise, mistrust government also seemingly high... one big shitshow Thinning herd. cannot fight ideologically driven conspiracies facts. simply work way. driven believe conspiracies along ideological lines develop rhetoric drive narrative new facts part conspiracy. tackle ideology drives conspiracy. root problem.   think conflicting information sure. Provincetown outbreak really goes everything seen far Delta.

We need better data see concern caused outbreak.  latest CDC data brought lot people like back sub. Outside daily discussion thread kind rhetoric becoming norm sub. real life? Absolutely not. People wanting normalcy. Vaccine mandates cruel.

Jesus christ rocker Sounds like masks rolling lockdowns forever mean, long government depriving minorities things, unlimited! stubbed toe day got vaccine moment swore I'd never get another vaccine again. due congestion common cold. Covid affecting brain nerves way common cold doesn't. enough data yet whether vaccine stops long term covid symptoms developing. Mild covid cases still cause long covid unvaccinated. hope vaccines stopping long covid developing know sure yet. man originally said last year can't issue lockdowns/masks county different &amp; left them. can't voted quick enough.  this? know states type behavior impossible due state constitution, idk anything dumpster fire Texas. language use? mean prevents 88 percent symptomatic cases?

If so, mass event would suggest otherwise.

If not, metric ""effectiveness"" based upon? Schools literally test length skirt can't require mask. Makes sense conservative. mean, you’re gunna it, hopefully don’t take day.   Fine. Die then. Fuck Greg Abbott. Texas giving tough competition. Last year 1000 deaths day  Fair point. ""Authorized"" would correct term. ""Emergency Use Authorization"", interim guidelines based Reddit biased. fall rabbit hole hate half population good reason. could possibly go wrong? There’s absolutely way backfire, comment age well!  think long travelers vaccinated barring catastrophic event breakthrough travel isn’t shutting US countries open again. number people vaccinated regions rise cases ebb flow. odd mask much push back something like Patriot act flies radar. weird fucking world live good news, great. UK sticking longer 8 interval order maximise overall efficacy.  Austin area, 11 Counties serving 2 million people, 13 open ICU beds. lot outlying counties transfer ICU cases Austin get overloaded, there’s that. However, we’re already lowest number beds entire pandemics.

I imagine doubling ventilators building new temporary wards might still options, delta wave probably hasn’t even hit earnest yet. we’re already present limits.

Anyone bans common sense medical precautions past mere criminal negligence point. They’re veering towards crimes humanity. Coming soon: Texas variant. He's pro-life, he's pro-birth. Whatever happens born, good luck that. EXACTLY.

These people proven one thing else;

THEY GIVE FUCK YOU. Oh spike brewing. Yesterday, Texas new cases since first week February. R0 1, get exponential growth, covid seems happen time restrictions relaxed. means every n days, new cases double. start small number, takes time things really get rolling, do... 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, .... single shot isn’t fully effective two weeks, anyways! It’s ridiculous. believe misreading say order grievance here. 


It matter reactive proactive general, adapt new information resulting actions correct. get that, trying understand figure nonvax deaths time frame…  2 Delta 2 Furious

Keep voting red Floridiots! Let schools make choices.

Honestly, really live Texas, probably seen get allow school districts make choices. example, grade school Texas, taught slavery small issue compared true causes Civil War, real historians call American Civil War, ""War Northern Aggression"". Turns true, all.

No, matters public health, required vaccines children, masks pandemic, cannot allow school districts decide. deciding follow recommendations best medical experts.

No, need Texas government make determinations, need based actual science. You’d feel sympathy kids long haulers, ok. 
What good them? 

Yes feel bad children die / long term issues sickness. 
I worked guy severely overweight unable partake physical exercise due ravaging influenza inflicted lungs child. 
He normal kid BAM! ability play like normal child. 
That vaccines important first line defense, mitigation efforts.  Efficacy calculated looking risk vaccinated person versus risk unvaccinated person.

75% vaccinated population , 25% unvaccinated population

75% vaccinated cases, 25% unvaccinated cases

There difference risk vaccinated / unvaccinated scenario.

Again I’m antivax, I’m fully vaccinated. numbers cdc reported ProvinceTown outbreak. One big differences 79 percent vaccinated folks group turned symptomatic. get feeling I'd rather watch literal train wreck, forced choose.  link interesting.

It looks like states could possibly mandate, would punishment non compliance? case provided link, fine. assume similar now. course might slow possible lawsuits chances catching spreading greatly reduced. already bit. Look places mask mandates last year implementing one year. Alabama,Texas,Mississippi,Universal Orlanda,Walmart customers, more. places mask mandates last year implementing one year. despite CDC guidance. Republicans bought via money. fuqn nut job Delta already spreading around world Biden even took office. come India, would've come somewhere else. inevitable.  pretty much wait death overloaded hospitals convince people get vaxxed. already seeing another uptick vaccination. I'd expect continue people face real consequences inaction. 

Masks alone, social distancing, barriers, capacity limits, full compliance etc going much. help encouraged, highly doubt effectiveness delta much infectious. nutter. Father?

Yes, son?

What ""regret"" mean?

Well son, funny thing regret is, better regret something done, regret something done. way, see mom weekend would sure tell her: SATAN! This. feel like absolute worst, we’ll go back things March. need shut things down.  GOP’s agenda, kill poor, weak base. Please someone explain makes damn sense, use small words cuz brain hurts.. Cases might likely it. expect see rising cases north east like last fall winter. going continue seasonal pattern long long time part yearly thing like flu yearly shots. Make mandatory Disney/events people get them. Bc can’t live without sports mouse seems pro-big government republican!
what’s view wheelchair ramps? know Hand many total deaths extracted 1141 from.. instance total deaths period 5K scarier opposed 20K That’s trend that’s incident I’m downplaying discouraging due fact people vaccinated numbers sever cases group still align effectiveness vaccine keeping people hospital dead. Best luck impending Delta infection, new symptoms, severe illness, potentially long Covid. vax’d I’m fool, I’ll take ticket agency wants give masking public. 

Close bars. Cancel cruises. Checking Facebook first mistake. think hard people, pro-vax anti-vax, conceptualize risk mitigation instead risk avoidance. breakthroughs due Delta variant, weakened estimation vaccine. see social media. sad part never-vaxers take trepidation proof big lie. 

Protection binary. reduction efficacy still good. prevention goal, significantly lower risk hospitalization death worth celebrating. want spread it, ultimately want get really sick die. takeaway anything else vaccine. Good luck helping 45 1,500 unvaccinated individuals also dealing covid! Wow, depressing. people would disbelieve climate change voted piece shit. Perhaps, possibility bad things sake bad things (at least, main reason)?

Or both? Money, *and* sadism. 4/5 people hospitalized vaccinated. There’s one day skin cat. undercook fish, believe not, power loss. I'm letting emotions make decisions. simply confused. one CDC study says vaccine effective delta, this. 

So correct? idea, I'm fine either answer. would like concrete answer without speculation. window closed, think globally US-centric. world received single shot.. hospitals full Massachusetts Covid?

If vax working They’re not? Code Black usually means bomb / security threat.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* matter anymore. Vaccinated people, like myself, spread virus well according latest reports.  deleted original one, Reddit quick dismiss Israeli data ""outlier"" past days we've seen wave sobering data regards vaccine effectiveness. going charitable assume people really overwhelmed right lashing out. data positive anything far away square one. bullshit likely legal (hopefully see resolved court) people obviously free wear masks want. Bottom lines though agree public health local matter decided people live local areas (within broad parameters obviously). Yes. sure downvoted. literally government limiting allowed do, rights allowed restrict. Yeah trust mostly broken, seeing state officials ppl waging war mask mandate reintroductions. feeling Delta prob much contagious ppl truly realize, vaccinated easily transmit ofc much better health outcomes. 

But basically means even 60% vaccination-rates unvaccinated population almost certainly get numbers prob going worse last years peak come winter. average almost 70k cases again, icu unvaccinated areas already peak. mayor FW R. board masks early Judge whatever he’s called. realize needles haystacks, occasional R isn’t science denying moron. Okay. That’s better news.I get flu shot every year too. Thank response. We've known likely never completely eradicate Covid. vaccines never expected bring cases 0, significantly reduce hospitalizations deaths point mostly return normalcy. Went Walmart without mask, felt naked. Plus everyone breathing everywhere. thanks. many flue like cold like diseases around forever.

If vaccines lower severity 90% vaccinated people probably good enough.

And lets let's hope better vaccines, keep working those. vaccinated people done part!

/s, case needed. fact 72% population Mass fully vaccinated also protects smaller proportion residents aren’t vaccinated. also don’t know vaccination rates control group superspreader event happened. could like 90% vaccinated/10% unvaccinated know.

Also keep mind Pfizer/moderna 90% effective Delta, also means twice many breakthrough infections happen Delta compared original strain. Also P-Town people clubs close hundreds people, superspreader easily infect dozen + people night, even everyone fully vaxxed.

Basically vaccines effective everyone vaccinated. delta transmsissable, threshold herd immunity higher previous strain, like 90% now. Sounds like sincere, genuine discussion. That's cool rock on, I'm willing engage.

And yeah, (to articulate least perceive personal viewpoint first time thread) think RNC wildly inconsistent claiming limited/small government, stance gay marriage great example. believe limited/small government, government business getting involved marriage.

I lot sympathy lot people downvoting thread RNC's hypocrisy small government. incredibly rare Republican has, balance, made government actually smaller. Ironically, greatest expansions recent history federal government's powers came Republican presidents: Patriot Act, Medicare Part D, bailout '08 financial crisis, bailout '20 financial crisis, wars Iraq, wars Afghanistan, etc. merits issues decided individually, point being: Republicans arguably expand government power Democrats do, paying lip service 'small government.' There's hypocrisy aplenty. would like refer 125th rule acquisition: can't make deal dead.  point, data showing vaccinated could spread original strain COVID well unvaccinated, especially vaccinated people. 

The end goal always making COVID far less deadly severe illness, stopping spread. 4 aged 20-70. 2 comorbidities, 2 didn’t. half country unvaccinated, new death figures India suggest around 4 million people died Covid country 66% population antibodies.

The US 50% vaccination + sure another 10 - 15% least got virus. So, already 66% mark higher, right? missing here? not. that's republicans sell 'limited' government.

They sell 'freedom whatever want' hell doing?

I hate here. Maybe due variants? 
Also think people need willing get tested right? 88% CDC study, citing UK study. UK used different dosing schedule. Look page 19 too. even US number effectiveness Delta.  Ah yeah. Governors done exactly things. even sent state patrol assist ""border problem"" Coming Texan, Abbott scourge state. can’t vote guy gerrymandering.  There’s always % idiots don’t take ‘hurricane coming, get town’ alerts seriously, hits window help closed. 

Same volcano eruptions. 
Same pandemics. 
Same climate change. 

‘But didn’t believe would bad’ Ugh know, I’m low key regretting getting vaccinated. I’m really active college student anyway seems like pandemic go forever regardless Depending crunch numbers, driving actually bit dangerous vaccinated person world behaving normally. doctors made clear I’d probably dead wasn’t vaccinated people dying Covid hospital unvaccinated. enough He’s Matt Damon Contagion. \~450 infections total, almost Delta variant. 5 folks hospitalized (4 5 fully vaccinated), deaths population. get awful public messaging goal COVID mitigation. actually still speaks quite well vaccinations. ran frequent flyer miles. hope fucking catch die knowing goddamn fault Texas Gov Abbott gigantic walking talking turd could give shit people's health. youngest one unvaccinated family we've definitely conversations keeping remote. goes back 2 weeks. I'm lucky take work to. debunk microchips? wealthy billionaire hand pick right one data showing up? Seriously, ignore going do? Texan here, dealing thing state. It’s fucked. Good news! 90% children die. Woo Hoo!   people really think going stop much anything?

[Yes, evidence shows even cloth masks, everyone wears them, significant impact It’s like want people get sick die. see actively making pandemic worse? No.

That’s true, unfortunately.

Anosmia well understood, least measured. doesn’t vary lot based virus caused it.

If olfactory nerves stop operating virally-induced inflammation 12% chance eventual recovery.

There slim chance COVID recovery somehow much better viruses, COVID particularly bad anosmia onset would strange recovery better. I'm sorry. cannot imagine going through. waiting new information Delta variant decide yesterday's WP article CDC slideshow/document basically sealed deal us. still feel weird hope something change next weeks unenrolled them. update school district dashboard twice week good indicator what's happening schools currently session. cannot imagine governor could continue like children's hospitals start sounding alarm. already dealing RSV right now. DeSantis wants dead children.  florida list?

Also, let’s look deaths per capita, tops states there? It’s like going mass school shooting event don’t know shooting begin.  [covid “Pro-COVID policies” excellent &amp; effective tag line. Apparently need federal law keep state legislative branches attacking public health May 2nd exposed cousin last Saturday Texan what’s difference. Flat states stupid people That's fair, standard, according others field, source appears pretty biased. applies issues support. soon fit, gone. bring abortion again. forgot 

D) forego lockdowns private enterprise enacts vaccine/negative test mandates. flying, restaurants, ubers, sporting events, concerts, etc. without proof negative test within past 72 hours vaccine passport.  longer nations, ideologies, ethnicity. dumb sack shit. Republicans contemptible morons. mean alot us never imagined GOP would back Trump are... Yea dig less makes sense base CDC global recommendation cases scenario. Seasonality data. people get tested week weekend every reason list sounds like brainer provide product pick up. Walmart corporate need weigh costs versus revenue versus loss revenue. walk store, mind purchase X products, see additional products make impulsive purchase buy Y. Pick services prevent impulsive purchases could result greater loss revenue store. 

The classic example impulsive purchases Costco sells fully cooked rotisserie chicken $5 take loss every chicken sell. plenty people go Costco buy chicken, enough people go buy chicken, end impulsively buying products makes loss selling chicken. whole concept called Loss Leader, products sold loss attract buyers purchase profitable items store. Costco started pick services could get away ordering 1 chicken pick up, would huge drop revenue; one reason many stores minimal order amount charge extra fee. 

So yes Walmart providing grocery pick select stores years select markets trial run. since pandemic Walmart made decision expand pick services almost every store. correct, people using it, looks like service good way people shop changed. whole groups people want use pick services, want selective fruit, pick milk expiration date. One thing true, stores ever adapting people shop. kind figured would something like that. He’s still believing anti vax propaganda. told wouldn’t hanging got vaccinated we’ll see does. Unfortunately parents also anti vax train reading bs articles “We want infected” — Trump White House

I guess it’s party thing. Ironic considering parent comment That's insulting covid. fellow Iowan seems I'm sick there's difference saying lalalala, there's threat anymore declared so. based UK study, anything new anything using dosing schedule (3 weeks). Immunocompromised people kids still exist. yes, unmasked vaccinated people putting risk, even unvaccinated people many positive asymptomatic.

However, it’s important note got shot different state got original J&amp;J—there’s federal vaccine database states might keeping track. Full approval expected within next 2 months. guess completely change opinion people get it, though suppose thats probably small minority. moms watched much 101.5 past year got nervous. Thank god head’s straight calls laugh nonsense. It’s nice hear local news debate omg sometimes it’s much listen past 3 days checking COVID stats California 25 deaths day.

Florida 80+.

So Florida half population 4x death rate. Problem read masking vaccinated individuals protection unvaccinated individuals self protection. would likely extraordinarily tough sell get vaccinated mask protect people willingly avoiding vaccine. shocker high school dropouts would capacity understand this. US covid deaths time low. understand death lagging indicator far vaccinations look job preventing death. like limited government limited ways like. Otherwise they're limited government oppression. education federally regulated beyond me. 

At point, matter national security. population uniformed science critical thinking would rather die preventable illness listen fucking doctor 5 minutes. 

It insane. 

I'm half expecting next terrorist attack half country saying bad defending terrorists... Wait already happened year. 

Education poor right literally threatening safety whole country. Obviously, *cough* entire south east *cough* certain states task educating children long time. time fix bullshit.

California 25. Sure, thought Shakespeare’s Globe-closing-factoid interesting, happened Bubonic Plague surge parallels venues closing now. lowercase “p,” term “plague” isn’t exactly scientific one, don’t think it’s necessarily “wrong” refer experience Covid plague. see semantic connotation term referring Black Plague, many folks associate word with, doesn’t mean every time someone uses word saying “This Black Plague.” Black Plague still exists people still get it. recover lot better 16th century, it’s still “The Plague.” comment mentioned frustration possibility husband's fertility affected since trying got diagnosed covid.


They asked trying pandemic. looked like deleted email alert showed.

Dunno business considering takes 9 months (in best case scenarios) slowly road endemic, loss last year agreed try summer anyways.

But worries, roadblocks surely commenter breathe peace mere stranger fertile pandemic. data research shows. point I’m wondering same. Tbh I’m angry CDC ever even lifting mask mandate. messaging coming inconsistent. I’m someone following guidelines mandates whole time, see people don’t trust CDC. Tennessee here. kid’s school starts Monday also masks.  Agreed. nothing shocking either. 2 empty spaces everyone's vax card, literally made room anticipation this. Yeah, know is, man. think really give advice please stay safe take whatever precautions can. Hopefully vaccines children approved soon. :( Health officials calling delta ""hurricane"" comes destroys stuff fast, leaves. reason governors think still need suck trump's dick. traitor trump done.

The reason CDC brought back mask mandates areas first two steps process, getting infection (asymptomatic otherwise) giving another person, far likely previously believed. know anyone knows odds vaccinated immunocompromised person getting severe illness, people shared doctors' anecdotes vaccinated people wind hospitals typically immunocompromised.

Either staying home, reconfigure entire office reinstitute temp checks masks. Cities ignore Gov. Abbott issue mask mandates. Texas AG would definitely challenge city mandates court, municipal governments enjoy power acting protect health, safety, welfare local residents. cities could therefore argue Gov. Abbott's ""no mask mandate"" must stayed Covid numbers fall acceptable levels. masks, [but doubling racist attacks Fuck piece shit. Key point here: “They said people need wear masks take steps prevent spread almost everyone population vaccinated.”

I mean, “almost everyone” vaccinated US won’t happen guess we’re effed also feel significant disconnect vaccination natural infection. Gottlieb genuinely thinks actually 1 mil new cases day (haven’t read article yet), even entirely unvaccinated population, gives thing many places go people even short lived natural immunity. 

Not I’m advocating let rip point temporary brick wall, unless immunity isn’t thing one wants tell anyone. much small government. Republicans really seem love covid, can't get enough would interesting. friend got covid last year got sick month after, thought might long covid ended mono Man, know joking not, I've seen said unironically before....

Reddit horrible place get news. Nothing worse place things legitimacy number upvotes get reach readers.

If News Stories rated Facebook Likes instead Upvotes Reddit would go balastic. Per week, day. Florida 73k last week That’s thing. I’m paralyzed indecision  Hoping could expand this. I’ve trying figure meant 3-fold reduction since yesterday. understand terms studies looking vaccine antibody titers (like South Africa variant x-fold reduction compared wild type, kind thing), I’m unclear baseline they’re reducing example. simple 100% chance infected, 3-fold decreased chance, 66%?

Thanks! sure that, think CARES act covers COVID care.  High enough we'll never eradicate destined endemic disease continue exposed entire lives. pandemic level spread happen immunity. way pandemic immunity - people get shot else get infection. year nice, round number something? 

You seem basing calendar rather science. **Death Bunny.** I'm sure pure coincidence, Florida, Arkansas, Alabama top-5 highest per-capita new case states. Texas Oklahoma top-10.

If can't national level, becomes ""state' rights"" issue. 

If can't state level, becomes ""local"" issue. 

If fails, whine rights individuals infringed upon.

Consider: Republicans votes legislature ban mask mandates nationwide, think would exercise restraint name ""state local rights""?

The dates perfect match, 21 27 June, Delta responsible around 90% Portuguese infections, depending region. B.1.621 outcompeted 1%.

I'm sure I'm allowed link stat trackers, Portuguese cases also showed 15% decline last week, 54.2% fully vaccinated.

Can’t federal government make illegal make illegal? still get girl pregnant wear condom too. wouldn’t, really hate precedent “vaccines another layer protection now” always meant way out. makes forever masks seem feasible makes feel fucking hopeless. law order? Weird. Hellworld ""You're gonna get Covid gonna like it!"" Yeah, old- middle aged (and recently young) people make kid's cluster higher chance die US' leading cause death.

Because contagious. get better option? dont understand logic scientific approach either, follow evidence. is, best, conjecture entirely unsupported evidence time.

The vaccines *not* becoming less effective virus mutating. appear happening greater viral load Delta causing great enough level exposure vaccinated people increasing chances infection.

Further, one benefits vaccines ability safely stop wearing mask. used lot messaging, like ads Department Health instance. Continuing enforce mask usage among vaccinated people would probably reduced vaccination rates somewhat.

The vaccines (especially mRNA ones) needed adjusted *yet* keep current mutations, including Delta.

I'm surprised people think they're better job following science lean towards worst-case scenarios. Fucking repubs turned shit another front culture war surprised constituents choking fluid. Doubly hilarious pride changing minds. honestly understand insurance companies enforcing higher premiums vaccinated. 

Does stupidity count preexisting condition? approved Canada mix vaccines based public research. phase 3 trial made privately owned Pharma company see good mix vaccine another brand lose sales. could even better take strenght vaccines type.  Lmao ever ""done them""?? friend Denver drove 3 hours conservative town Coloroda since wide open availability months ago. I'm sorry, I'm following data. NHS graphs like CDC one liked showing infections per population hospitalizations? course, everyone getting sick (see Oklahoma), kids get sick proportionally. That's important adults get vaxxed kids too. Friend ICU nurse Manhattan exclusively COVID year. currently 0 COVID patients unit. reassures cases increasing repeat last year. Well spoke couple employees know personally since used work said think it’s BS since got vaccinated, can’t really blame understand frustration I’ve reading (sorry mobile easy link stuff), seems Covid, even vaccinated person, spread others (vax unvaccinated). It’s made rethink summer hangouts I’m curious it’ll play gain information around it. Also recent data shows, vaccinated still share viral load, get vaccinated others arguments falls flat

The news infected vaccinated people significantly likely spread virus previously thought. still believe vaccine significantly decreases change getting infected first place, vaccinated people still significantly less likely spread virus. (And vaccine still *greatly* decreases chance severe illness.) wouldn’t surprised if, whole, we’re infecting million people day right now, we’re picking maybe 10th less 10th that,” former Food Drug Administration commissioner said

That seems incredibly high [CDC we've detected 1 4 cases, includes spring 2020 little testing done. Misleading data. Slides Ferrer's PC show 120 vaccinated people hospitalized week LA. maybe 300 new hospitalizations total. good. What's time frame now? couple days since exposure? More? Nah, masks flatten curve unless unvaxxed people use time buys get vaccinated they're gonna catch pass vaxxed people anyway. Masks dont stop anything, slow down. Unless expect 10s millions change mind vaccination, masking delay inevitable. know proximity viral carriers COVID-19 one largest indicators spread. let’s take grand look population densities Texas California, also take city city look actual densities:

California Population Density: 251.3 people per square mile

Texas Population Density: 109.9 people per square mile

&amp;nbsp;

Also figures major city population density Texas:

* Dallas Population Density: 3965 people per square mile

* Houston Population Density: 3630 people per square mile

* Austin Population Density: 3162 people per square mile

Now California major cities:

* Los Angeles Population Density: **8495 People per square mile**

* San Francisco Population Density: **18562 people per square mile**

* San Diego Population Density: 4381 people per square mile

* San Jose Population Density: 5677 people per square mile

* Sacramento Population Density: 5376 people per square mile

All sudden, Texas tracking 77% California’s infection rate 83% California’s death rate doesn’t look rosy picture make be. Especially California twice population density, major California cities much **5 times** population density largest cities Texas.

If anything, shows utterly terrible Texas done respect California containing COVID-19. Yup, lot Americans abroad returned get well.

I think you’re little stupid, relative anti-vaxxers you’re certified brain genius. wonder higher vaccination across pond played role well. also earlier start us Delta becoming dominant iirc. I’d say another month falls that’s rough guess. Vaccine stop transmission. protected severe illness though much shit it’s right now. abortion education legislation really top list personally. That’s inexcusable, people saying Texas “probably going blue next election” since 2008. That’s plenty time happened now. don’t think it’s happening. conservative faction gets truly desperate straight something stay power forever. exactly endgame killing constituents? seem like good strategy. could changed much? It’s pandemic, every part world gets affected. shit hole reading aren’t vaccinated wondering we’re returning mask wearing, guess what. It’s fault.

Just thought…..

Enough nonsense. mean cruel, truly putting us severe risk compromising emergency medical services. ""Some may die, sacrifice willing make"" -- Gov. Faqwuad Abbott Yes, absolutely! Thankfully Republicans power mandate federal level. Crazy difference percentage points, less, election make national level well state city. Something feels taking advice furry. It’s stressful freak every new development initial reports often based incomplete data since virus new. often experts disagree initially. try wait freak portion give weeks. Delta may end peaking quickly. don’t know certain. solution misinformation authorities? don’t like wish ill people, guy needs learn lesson yeah unfortunately I'm guessing everyone plain going get this, whether get sick partially lottery partially lifestyle. probably always going happen virus may never completely killed - unless runs things infect.

Anecdotal, know couple tested positive, one bed ridden, went worked fields since even know sick. see mean felt heard. decisions moving forward based personal safety (I mental health issues I'm jazzed possibility cognitive degradation) local hospitalization rates. kids might relatively unscathed mean secondhand effects hospital services won't. 

So, uh...do kids?

The proper framing get us this. God willing. Yes. Reason AL doesn’t educate citizens properly make informed decisions based science. large portion unvaccinated Alabama POC. Still think it’s cool many sick? People vaccine spreading like unvaccinated. gamble incentivize getting jab able remove mask flopped.

Jesus. thats actually good thinf, better safe sorry  wonder get along! Good you! asked could done differently start. said, travel bans zero covid policies. delta never came country wouldn’t covid threat longer.

Places pursued zero covid enjoyed much safer lives able open far longer places not. Eh, could let work unvaccinated. mean sure, death familiar back then, well attested lot trauma surrounding great mortality*. really sure would anyone left alive.

From see, currently legal challenges there. know failed, may state dependent well.

Several articles I've read seem indicate may gray area. seem likely  
that lawsuit challenging required vaccination good chance winning, court cases (yes aware already), think definitive yet.

I’ve yet see anything really gets upvoted awarded comments pointing misleading straight-up fabrication, cannot said Facebook slightest. resent places like NYC even considering mask mandates clear huge part country nothing - actively trying ruin everyone.

Let us live vaccinated, low COVID-rate bubble, keep people places (eg. Texas) establishments. Otherwise, collectively, we'll never get lives back. Honestly, tons people done movies, zoos, even whole concerts masked. It’s good before-times we’re resilient adapt. concern there's severe disease vaccinated people (very rare)

&amp;#x200B;

I guess depends consider ""very rare."" 

At 95% efficacy severe cases, means vaccinated person 1/20th chance severe case compared unvaccinated person.  It’s ok understand. understanding 3 fold decrease means third chance catching compared someone unvaccinated.

So (100 - 33.33) = 66.67% efficacy wife do: one person work days work nights. Yep, sore throat asthma flaring up. Could due many things, since I'm seeing lots family members 60 years old next weekend wanted make sure symptomatic breakthrough!

I'm Flonase + Zyrtec + Singulair regimen sometimes still need inhalers fml  DELTA CONTAGIOUS EVEN VACCINATED

this isn’t technically *wrong,* phrasing awkward/irresponsibly hysterical enough I’m pretty comfortable calling disinformation. 

If didn’t know better, I’d see header immediately assume vaccines don’t work Delta understand post meant parody, overall tone eerie similar actual anti vaxxers New report states virus continues mutate among vaccinated, given reinfection rates among Alpha, natural immunity, creating new variants inevitably escape vaccines. Essentially we're screwed; never going end true US never comply. Glad it, thanks hard work keep state safe! mean, straight wrong. They're same. adjust population, Texas statistically significant increased number deaths. got mine grocery store, 2 pack $24. tested negative! wagon wheels Totally get viruses spread one arms it; ie colds flus. Parents example would knowingly send kids school sick. trying start argument it’s observation. ok cold flu Covid? ""Typhoid Abbott"" ""Die me."" may also find useful - fixthemask.com  Time new sticky? ""Vaccines EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE Delta variant, safe."" I’ve reading (sorry mobile easy link stuff), seems Covid, even vaccinated person, spread others (vax unvaccinated).

This helps absolutely nobody. feel self conscious knowing, join conversation way. Zero COVID?? Don’t make laugh. ignorant be? small island nations even attempted zero covid inevitably failing due Delta. US hundreds millions people thousands miles land borders. Zero covid non-starter.

Like seriously bruh. Don’t suggest something impossible zero covid travel bans. It’s unrealistic makes impossible take seriously.

As soon Alpha Delta sprung elsewhere done deal they’d end here. That’s politics, that’s pandemics work. “Pan” pandemic means all. places affected. could 100% vaccination rate still zero covid.

Get head. NEVER zero covid. Kiss possibility goodbye otherwise spend entire life waiting scenario isn’t remotely realistic.  blows away. Seeing anyone congratulates Texas erodes humanity’s progress. media largely fault people seeing Delta non-issue June.

They plastered UK, SA, Brazil variants news cycle months nothing significant happened them, lulled Americans false sense security. 

People convinced wouldn’t anything based previous variants, closing borders India enough address it. acknowledge virus stay might continue mutate spreads. breadth acknowledge vaccine doesn’t keep contracting spreading delta variant. getting vaccine doesn’t stop spread FUCK SUPPOSED DO?? logic, getting vaccine won’t stop mutating. ask again, FUCK DO??? madman.

Worth reading rest [his short  I’m aware this, I’m wary familiar viruses influenza EBV well. person whose mom Parkinson’s, triggered bout viral encephalitis, take viruses seriously, want data re: long covid/post-viral vaccinated people relax it.  basically though. Covid alien virus, type virus common well understood. functions respiratory viruses, spreads faster results severe disease (and one immunity year ago). There's reason expect weird symptoms years line. work like HIV chicken pox. apparently, so, well done Walmart, better bring security, deniers force probably!

Well that's foreboding...  way first amendment doesn’t allow government prohibit abridge free speech limits government. restrict power government control people’s choices.

Not allowing government force someone something limits government to. completely agree think small subset people would argue government cannot require full approval.  


I hope gets fully approved soon people excuse get anymore.  


ANyone see news lately might fully approved emergency use? willing die him

They might, way thought would. bunch Pro-Life people sure Pro-Death (not even counting love death penalty). responsible, wore masks, got shots could go back normal. 

When locked again, losing work, paying high prices grocery store they'll blame Biden idiots eat up. unreal. even ground staff right ? could hot take seems like Trump worship overtaken nearly core values old Republican party I'm longer wondering whether 3 year old able vaccinated gets covid. definitely get covid first. (And age fine.)

This must scary time parents kids immune compromised can't yet get vaccine. heart goes them. get new variants. Stop saying dumb shit flu fuck lungs ground opacities like covid does. One. pneumonia does, one good indicator covid do.

They also think covid may cause infertility men.

They also think maybe cause lasting brain damage people.

This stuff need study unknown. hospital worked Kentucky (this decade ago) Code Black severe weather code. gonna sprint, sprint under-12 EUA, scream parents young kids.

This exactly screamed *citatations needed*

This ignorant comment. citations? attempting break comment, using emotion. incorrect, disingenuous. 

Your reading comprehension also poor. advocating ""complete isolation."" commented hybrid models. creating argument, one. 

I check post history...all post opinions subreddit. nothing way citations. consider (actually quite small) risk covid (including studies showing limited risk ""long term side effects covid"") 100% unacceptable

What ""quite small"" risk addressing? people died? people wind hospitals? Lost work due illness. kids spread teachers, parents? 

Estimates coming lost close 1 million people COVID. 

[A new study estimates number people died COVID-19 U.S. 900,000, number 57% higher official study's authors say, COVID-19 death count nearing 7 million, double reported number 3.24 million.

You're ignoring facts, favor opinion, nothing situation. 

You completely ignore statement hybrid models, keep transmission low, keep people safe. Masks, smaller class size, etc...

You're disingenuously pretending care people, children, completely ignoring rising transmission factors. 

No one wants way. Looking intelligently, keeping safety measures place essential. thought death happened 1% cases even vaccination? don’t feel crowd old think.

As 30 year old, friends age regularly bring “did see X Facebook” never ask saw something news channel. People age watch news channels, news comes Facebook. degree statistics work analyst - I'm well aware works. Claiming hide spike trends average absolutely incorrect unless looking something like 3-day ""spike"" - basically irrelevant talking long term trends. There's reason almost meaningful Covid reporting uses rolling, weekly averages daily fluctuations. hate asks consideration accountability. 


If Texas introduced legislation saying mandatory least 30 firearms 2022, they'd think. brilliant company decided move give us new office cubes *shoulder high walls* ""increased collaboration"" BS. multiple coworkers refuse get vaccinated traveling going vacation like nothing wrong yet I'm expected return office. lol...hell no! really wish government would mandate WFH us simply want work physically next stupid. 😫 mean, yeah? point, yeah is.

Two weeks pandemic, means protecting yourself? Masks absolutely worth it.

Going December, tolerance wearing bit thin. vaccines weren’t available yet, middle surge, absolutely still worth it.

But we’re year half thing, I’ve fully vaccinated months. Masking doesn’t anything me.

An inconvenience, matter mild, tolerable long benefit inconvenience. vaccinated; benefit masking. looking comment. *facepalm*  Fair enough vaccine gives good odds delta variant (like getting flu shot perfect match strain year) makes different? So, like Lucky King Hill. even skeevier friend got J&amp;J would ok received another 2 shots mRNA vaccine? key stats really many hospitalized people vaccinated?

I absolutely agree important stat *most* public policy measures. 


But still need understand virus transmitted. Turning blind eye uncomfortable data helpful and, we're seeing right now, ends contributing atmosphere distrust.  


I've definitely thought, we're bound get sooner later. I've even (briefly) considered tossing precautions allowing get it. remind want vector. want responsible somebody else's illness. I'm going get sooner later, vote later better treatments available. Oh didn’t mean way. think Abbott hypocrite using big government approach. thought person commented also trying claim anti-big government that’s Abbott wrong. clearly pro-big government support mask mandates and/or major restriction personally agree with. everyone got triggered comment lol. guess big government ok agree   easier get vaccine get license? US, consider heading saner country. Things going get better whole thing runs awful course. Oh well that’s surprising  OP. One reason virus concern rate infected requiring hospitalization high enough outbreaks hospital capacity strained. LA last winter COVID wards popped hospital gift shops car parks, example, India earlier year massive shortages medical equipment oxygen tanks. people ended hospital particular outbreak (indeed none died might expect 2-4) say vaccines still offer means reduce hospitalizations (and death) thus also solution one major logistical problems (providing care ill) pandemic. Totally red tide see either everyone come beach! Thank noticing! horrible outside daily thread.   always knew Texas slowly creeping towards turning purple, Republicans fucking badly, surprised see Kamala win 24 Disney could probably afford close Disney World. would hurt bit, Florida much more.

Besides, lawsuit would probably fall favor businesses making decisions. ABP mobile browser + Javascript site exceptions defeats pretty much stuff I'm gonna die auto-erotic-asphyxiation. die lack oxygen, terms. Friend mine WFH entire time.

Gets dragged back office reason almost immediately - exposure. stupid. agree, start voting Abbott office. Funny though. DC, fortress trump voters, vax rates dont go up. people, damn GOP fanatics, dont want get shots…. tell, it’s sarcasm. whole GOP / southern states cliche trope. isnt DC 100% vaxxed? like 6 Republicans ln whole city. NyC. sooner drop false rhetorics Red=bad, blue =perfect, sooner able reach convince people reluctant get shots miss going kid, walking around looking seemed infinite racks clothes.

Something 90s it. Sigh. would anyone live shithole state? Lol. They're links sent friends. Low effort click. everyone OK-circle left FB yet. Ptown 100% vaccine coverage among locals. Combine tourists mostly gaycationers skew liberal would surprised vaccination rates among well excess 75%. absolutely never walk back anything matter many people die unless child.

Conservativism another word stagnation. ""One hospitalized patient (age range = 50–59 years) vaccinated multiple underlying medical conditions. Four additional, fully vaccinated patients aged 20–70 years also hospitalized, two underlying medical conditions.""

That's reassuring. I’ve heard number may waaaay higher testing breakthrough lands hospital.

I cold like symptoms week, got tested negative. saying positive, CDC count breakthrough? urgent care facility test asked vaxxed certainly correct information report breakthrough not.  Texas blue less religious, would real contention one best places live. red, consider profits power grid, religious extreme morals rights. painful, change better. Phenomenal quote. They're saying test change anything (negative test? Wear mask day 14. test all? Wear mask day 14). That's fine, people test whenever, long negative tests treated proof infection let's restrictions. can't make virus disappear, get pandemic control bring daily deaths virus highly developed countries almost zero enough people get vaccinated. Herd immunity achieved, without vaccine.

This virus awful. single good reason live threat heads vaccines. 

You claim I'm willing sell civil liberties I've done insist people get vaccinated, yet one willing condemn hundreds millions fragile people live world every interaction carries non negligible risk contracting potentially deadly disease. even die it, there's nothing benign COVID-19, fuck anyone months. wife father's cousin still recovered senses smell taste two infections early late 2020. run-of-the-mill infection often nasty one half thinks half mere foot soldiers tyrants

You get claim half population. humans (a large majority) reasonable enough get vaccine. Virtually every person knows they're talking comes immunology getting vaccinated. One quick glance people standing next convince anyone they're wrong side history.

Vaccines awesome. claim that's self-evident anyone modicum knowledge medicine history. Covid aside can't news you. I'm saying good thing families absolutely depend schools safe place leave kids day since double incomes basically required now. UK case numbers crashing now. Im hoping see Florida takes quick turn. Seems like Delta burns hot fast.  that’s reason people seem focus Florida. others said, think unreasonable expect highly vaccinated, I'd also like add know percentage vaccinated unvaccinated people *responded* requests contact tracing.

It seem like stretch say unvaccinated individuals less likely respond vaccinated are, vaccinated individuals likely respond experiencing symptoms vs not. irony comment flu deaths surpassed war time deaths decades, centuries ago. 

This metric meaningless btw. Heart disease kills comparable amount war time deaths *each year*, though almost never expressed terms. 

Put another way - death disease almost always higher deaths war. isn’t state law. It’s EO. Sadly probably staying walmart. applies corporate employees regular ground staff. ground staff get forced back masks dealing 1000 unvaccinated maskless customers day big difference though? stats see are:

Fully vaccinated, 57% vs 49%, partially, 70% vs 57%.

Definitely difference, expect UK vs US trajectories different ~10% difference? fully expect US worse, catastrophically worse. know. It’s stupid. hope amount people getting boosters pretending first shot skewing numbers. don’t want contribute covid gofundme campaigns. I’ve friends coworkers sick this. covid. That’s talking about.  Fuck no, that’s Nigel Farage. Even get 0 cases day US tomorrow, billions unvaccinated people worldwide could increase case count.

If you’re vaccinated, that’s best protection get. Unless literally wear n95 mask rest life even that’s 100% effective. many states making 'executive orders' prevent mask mandates schools, limit making opt-out. depressing. also turn America’s number one insurance plan, gofundme Fool Cool, thanks! sure since they're EUA guess considered within employer's rights mandate anyway. main symptoms vaccinated people little different standard covid symptoms.

The top 5 common: 

- Headache

- Runny nose

- Sneezing

- Sore throat

- Loss smell Whoa (here’s link: )

Apparently it’s study right now, lingering possibility dementia development future among infected individuals can't make accurate conclusion based that. way determine efficacy without knowing demographics population.

What everyone 12? vaccination rate would zero. 90? would 90%. 

This data useful vaccine efficacy, tells story something happen statistically useful beyond yet still it. patriot stop wearing pants? No, comply. Proving original point. Thanks. vaxxed that. current vaccines fda approved. given emergency approval lot leeway companies things go awry. vax list used decades, approved independent bodies, subject rigourous approval process. wish people acceptant vax, good faith, cannot compare pfizer/ moderna vax covid ones. same. participant society literally entire ""responsibility"" fucking dolt. That's follow rules, whole thing call country stays together. follow every law social norm somehow buck societal responsibility stops preventing spread deadly disease??? fucking dolt.   Exactly. Limited government.

Local governments cant, instance, ban protests. state federal laws preventing local governments implementing measures unduly restrict rights citizens. I've vacation week cdc changed guidelines people wearing masks dropped drastically North Fort Worth. I'm currently Galveston MAYBE 1 10 wearing masks indoors. I'd wager 1 20 honestly. Really hoping see better numbers get back. dont disagree that, vaccine appear help prevent bad outcomes. However research seems indicate you’re gonna get covid even vaccine it’s going roll dice outcome is. death hospitalization bad, also don’t think anyone is/should looking forward flu symptoms and/or long term effects. 

That’s overall question. seems like point you’re going get accept hope best. can’t see avoid something contagious cold everyone gets every year. wish rushing lesser extent.

FFS, understand importance details? small % still takes massive ding patient care. people getting worked like dogs, people leaving due mandates. gonna stress already stressed system. You’d need control age factors, right? older people disproportionately small percentage infected, instance, would make sense people hospitalized older etc. I’d want see data stacks compared demographic breakdown group. Texans vote individuals, vote capital letters. Cool, literally care. people get virus made choice getting vaccinated. that’s true. worried might happen didn’t appreciate science doesn’t move speed 24 hour news cycle. That’s complaint.

My complaint CDC often seems claim things safe, finds backtrack new data comes out.

I would expect public health agency err side caution, CDC repeatedly bitten lack caution. distressing part again. don’t seem learning mistakes.

It appears (from perspective) CDC rushing re-open things short-term economic reasons, repeatedly caused people act recklessly, prolonged pandemic.

There departments would better suited worry economy, commerce department. Public health agencies concern public health. report science. public health agency repeatedly errs side economic growth, nothing mission, gives appearance political interference. Yeah worked great Brazil Abbott President? idio... er sorry want insult anyone.  75$ enough incentive get free shot? Fuck pandemic kill stupid people instead ~~using~~ recycling vectors even little oil show it. data 0% effective vaccinated likely hospital unvaccinated. Wear mask guess. Aren’t employment states? texas say texans ok people dying? like what's number americans, family, friends, neighbors, need die something governor. Thank you!  I’m surprised haven’t tried making illegal get vaccinated yet. American. many think people taking third dose? read reddit, taking third dose disclosing fully vaccinated, fact, main advice deny get rejected Gives new meaning ""Give Liberty Give Death...""

&amp;#x200B;

I guess case... I'm crossing fingers you! guess that’s difference delta variance.  No, refuse mask still see them. refuse service mask get fined now.  # may die, risk I'm willing take!


Never thought comedy characters become reality lifetime. corporate employees. regular ground staff unaffected this. people joke. Jesus. won’t mandate vaccine, reasonable thing do, I’m likely going switch every class online. mood play stupid game. Herd Immunity (the hard way) bust! argument preventing government overreach. like law explicitly allowing people weapons. 64.7% people MS fully vaccinated. go that. Code Black, Defcon-1? parent Thier right mind would send Thier kids camp?

On flip side, NC (and probably many states) covid outbreaks required reported. sure applicable schools not. got sic came home ruined plans vacation. told possible couldn’t smell anything scheduled test ASAP don’t understand trying everything could like around want stay common areas like idiots need use microphone things like that. wanted gone already haven’t put date pissed said go judge actually sided Austin Paxton's lawsuit. Travis County Judge Lora Livingston ruled Paxton's arguments. March 26, 2021. POS (point sale) telling gay people knock off, women want right able control body tell knock off, majority republicans voted Patriot Act multiple occasions, conservatism really ever limited government 30 years life country.. Rate hospitalisation among unvaccinated people: 132 per million

Rate hospitalisation among fully-vaccinated people: 16 per million fucking cripple... swear. really contagious chickenpox, CDC document claims, kinda fucked. 

If quick search chickenpox rates, see this: 

""More 95 percent American adults chickenpox 4,000,000 people get chickenpox every year.""

Given know spread among vaccinated people wearing masks, matter time Delta mutates enough circumvent even vaccines' protection. 

It really scientists predicted endemic would unfold; arms race viruses vaccines. probably another mRNA tier breakthrough technology Yep. made exception executive order health care clinics. think exception hospitals doctors offices. Call narcissism way say human. USA joke nobody laughing.  R0 Delta strain reported high 8. exponential growth! 1, 8, 64, 512, 4096, 31768.... fact gave probably absolute worst case example beach party, (those stats probably way higher actual (didn't say 75% infected vaccinated?). people hear 75% vaccinated people still get covid still spread easily vaccinated. 

Like you, I'm hopeless ever. endgame sight. ""once vaccine"" goal ateast give us hope. mention take remove masks again. I'm positive mask mandate last longer actually necessary. will.justify saying ""see happened May lifted them?"". Upcoming school holidays spook too. ""Lets make sure get spkies holidays. safe time"". know point end. definitely longer mentally prepared applies corporate employees hi! thanks this. seems confirm Fauci's declarations, masks seems necessary Delta variant, even vaccinated, order protect youself others, sad true. Probably lot cases vaccinated ones lot people change approach life &amp; virus, vaccination . However important vaccines seems protect severe illnes, majority cases I'm requiring proof vaccination, masks well?

If entire audience vaccinated, need masks? Smart. every school country, including public schools ages get vaccine. Absolutely. vaccine helps mitigate symptoms bodies adequately fighting virus, meaning still spread it. FDA approval makes legal difference. precedent already set failed lawsuits healthcare systems mandated it. There’s sense long term covid risks somehow elusive hard quantify therefore it’s worth worrying worrying leads obsession/madness whatever.

I don’t agree that, seems discrete specific questions covid body long term vaccines modulate risk, it’s reasonable want answers questions making decisions pandemic “over.” never agreed consensus instant vaccination occurs death/hospitalization mitigated light switch flipped risks eliminated overnight. spent entire pandemic focused avoiding long covid death, frankly. I’d still like get answers. problem focusing vaccination right late make difference, least many places. everyone got first dose today, would still five weeks rising cases overflowing hospitals.

Masking offers immediate benefit. people started wearing masks now, could help reduce cases next weeks.

Despite that, agree guidance change leads people ignoring it, even changing good reasons. Disney afford employees can't. governor bright fuck cares wear mask sacrificing military readiness they're putting us risk too. pretty much useless masks 1sr use stores, nose chin all.
Leaders want right thing held back people lead say government interfere business turn around pass law interfering businesss right require masks enter. don’t care principles long it’s want. r/UnexpectedPawnee I’m aware exact date Deltas mutation. please provide source? 

To best knowledge emerged India largely publicized April. 

13 months impacted us US. Excuse me? vaccines still prevent serious illness hospitalizations death effectively even Delta! must’ve confused Florida. I’m wrong. bad. still concerning though:

“prohibiting cities government entities state enacting vaccine requirements mask mandates protect coronavirus, even virus's contagious delta variant drives another surge covid-19 cases Texas.”

Cities businesses you’re right. cities people. people work government. Still fan, thanks making distinction actual fucking moron. assume card. proof ? Parents year here. they're alive covid, late googled found article this. Definitely sounds like something would common expected severe viral infection. gotten tested need gig next week. usually best easiest way get test? home tests fine? ideas? Hey quick FACT- average daily death rate FLU 2017/2018 30 people DAY Netherlands. 
This last MONTH 60 people died covid TOTAL ONLY. 
Please look yourself.  It’s highly reduced spread among vaccinated that’s opinion that’s data. US social culture absolutely kept modern science infectious disease control prevention. Masks absolutely given feel like may exposed infectious disease might coming something go public. Staying home work school sick tolerated rewarded. can't run business without sick people work need re-evaluate management abilities business model. Dismissing everything ""allergies, contageous"" ""just suck up"" eliminated public discourse. proven sick people working public worse expensive generous sick day benefits.

When comes enforcing christofascism propaganda, Republicans love swing big gubmint dick around. slipped pee-pee Cosco got $53,000 settlement. know many vaccinated *didn't* catch virus? % people area vaccinated? highly vaccinated group tightly packed together, bound skewed numbers like this. x number people *didn't* get it?

All data seen thus far shows vaccines especially effective greatly reducing chances severe symptoms death. enough people get it. magic bubble. local hospital system (city 300k) 99% hospital age 50 COVID unvaccinated. 93% age 50 unvaccinated one 7% that's vaxxed 1 shot.

(Y'all, give tips keep glasses fogging up. something I've deal *every* mask I've worn. don't. I've tried everything.) Oof. can't disagree. Way go conservatives! Always looking little guy! So, hide behind them…..but still! Sucks kid, guess.  someone taken pandemic seriously elderly parents, sounds like point short locking inside, aren’t going avoid Delta. correct statement? 


It appears contagious even something like parents going grocery shopping going expose them. guess maybe could lock inside 3rd booster, knows happens. 


My mother father 67. slightly overweight dad also diabetic. mom actually still works RN hospital I’m amazed hasn’t caught yet (works labor delivery around Covid+ patients), fully vaccinated January.

So now, back original point: different vaccinated around unvaccinated people? 

I reduced risk chose move community. Someone else chooses reduce risk same.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 74% infected vaccinated. Yeah… I'm point  It’s understandable. much still unknown, appear ending soon. Good luck.  Abott sucking dick anti vax voters simultaneously fucking everyone power grid vaccinated, primed immune system eliminates virus early infection. That’s prevents mutation. even true vaccinated folks producing mutants, sure wouldn’t reason remaining unvaccinated stay unvaccinated. top? 74% infected vaccinated. Yeah, great look. Yeah see real world examples time... Area's visitors lean heavily liberal.  can't say without knowing percentage people vaccinated first point.

If 5,400 people vaccinated 100 people every single unvaccinated person gets infected 90% vaccinated people protected would mean 25% cases happened unvaccinated.

No, believe breakdown instance, that's problem. can't make conclusions vaccine efficacy without knowing population judge actually sided Austin Paxton's lawsuit. Travis County Judge Lora Livingston ruled Paxton's arguments. March 26, 2021. “Life, ah, finds way.” Can't wait lawsuits filed. point wonder Texan residents case civil suit Abbott losses damages.  unvaccinated idiot office always yell top lungs hover everything. hate lol Maybe need reevaluate you’re getting news from, there. seen single article warning take vaccine.   restaurant bars? Large scale events capacity limits, like sports concerts? inevitable point things need shutdown, heavily restricted, suspended again, even masks? think headline pandering desire lose mind. Good riddance ass...where delta variant need it? That’s unfortunate. 

I guess doc private practice sons dentist came require masks. 5 hospitalized almost 900 people infected...that's incredibly effective number vaccine.  Covid severe flu, know this. Viral infections mess up, like said, surprise cases long term damage caused. I've seen stories referencing sound clickbaity often data back up. Prohibiting cities?? right smaller government?? seem like are. argument here. Well suppose mostly right personally unlikely die could knock butt week two.  course spread others including loved ones.  Right? feel like data would make people hesitant take vaccine. develop side effects 10% chance it’s serious sounds like lot. That's good. also pre-Delta. schools open, well started year round schedule two weeks ago. 25 positives 82 quarantined. maybe 1000 kids. Masks mandated inside. Sounds like good ""90s"" weekend me! agree. Case numbers meaningless point vaccinated cases rarely wind hospitals dead.  great hearing, masking realized much rely seeing lips move understand others even necessarily read lips. seems happen subconsciously, everyone's wearing mask found asking people repeat things often.

It also help there's piece plexiglass cashiers too. Lol, don’t even carry weapons. isn’t DMZ. 

For example friend pilot fly’s internationally. army check randomly isolating. don’t carry weapons, rock knock door see home. Nope 100% serious. kinda weird walking picturesque New England village seeing leather shop main street.  Yeah people vaccinated get mildly sick going get tested. Plus major testing centers around anymore, go way get test now. good evidence moderate protection 8-10 days first shot. Sure, full protection takes 5-6 weeks depending shot, protection vastly better none, especially preventing serious complications. Cool story bro beatings continue morale improves.  back square one? Could imagine coronavirus like smallpox? Spanish colonized Americas, brought diseases them. met population hadn’t exposed coronavirus exposed them, think would worse smallpox natives. must young mother  mention, he’s working ERCOT spread cost power grid winterization among people pay bills instead digging companies’ profits.

That’s like going McDonalds buy big mac, pay extra get ice cream machine fixed I’m there. happened wife spring - lucky delta wasn’t going around cause probably would caught it. It’s developed Africa countries current vaccination campaign. fact, India vaccine power house fine. Ah, yes. old, “personal attacks, can’t reasonably debate subject arguments.” hallmark tolerance intelligence. Don’t know you’re paid astroturfer willfully misinformed, blatant lies falsehood doomerism like exactly prevents rational discourse issue.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  2016 election. compare states’ breakthrough rates? might factors aren’t seeing data one data point. CDC could trying sound alarms cause another screeching halt society thus downplaying things crossing fingers. Texas Governor's Mansion closed since March 2020

Same Tallahassee. big vacation spot people informed. RIP. US 330 million people, 48 million 12. Google tells 189.5 least one dose 163.6 million fully vaccinated. leaves 92 million people US received covid vaccinations despite eligible. Reminder types headlines, binary thing. 85% unvaccinated mean 15% fully vaccinated. Completely vaccinated patients accounted 7% admission

So words, 93% people fully vaccinated.

Falls line study, study, study. Relevant username? Seems like yesterday debating opening schools last year. state? would fight like hell get mask mandate schools choice send kids. Ironically executive orders masks shaky legal ground. Without passing law legislative system mask mandates actually enforceable, dispute makes court pretty easily shot down. Mask mandates generally exist inconvenience.

Governors really mean able make declarations like outside state emergency, historically never lasted weeks, well year. My…God!  awesome 5G connection can’t facts here. Florida man bad. possible got false positive? what? recall anyone claiming vaccines would prevent infection, would greatly reduce chances serious illness, hospitalization death. fact do. 

Vaccines magic shields make completely immune things. men claim Christianity yet experience like bunch doubting Thomas’s believe happen them? “They honor lips, hearts far Me.” Tam literally wrong every step pandemic, Canada overall given first doses 70% population almost 60% fully vaccinated, we’re still almost vaccinating 1% population day, casedemic, they’ll probably use excuse enact another 6 month curfew. study literally says data sufficient draw conclusions effectiveness vaccine. 

It *could* case, data would need corroborate that. Shhhhh, lay back let happen. herd culling itself. surprised 70% country fat disgustingly fat. Turns you’re likely die ALMOST EVERY DISEASE you’re obese. one wanted talk last year either. USA average BMI closer China bet we’d 80% fewer deaths, that’s talking ass saw hospital. top 3 infectious COVID19 states country California, Texas, Florida Gov Abbot wants prohibit mask-wearing vaccines Delta specifically? data this. appears long COVID somewhat less prevalent vaccinated people, still happens 20% breakthrough delta infections. Driving dangerous even close. US, around 1,400 breakthrough deaths. Figure that's period 6 months. Extrapolate year that's 2,800 deaths. 30,000 car accident fatalities year.

People many things riskier without thinking twice it. Serious question: chickenpox airborne though? saw Ebola mentioned understood, Ebola transmitted via bodily fluids. chickenpox airborne, comparing apples oranges least apples pears?  Boo Read study lol someone please sneeze professor xaviers dumb face please first bi thought joking naive host

Hah typo? works ways can't tell. seeing total cases == exposed? significant portion people test positive, aware that, right? population PTown summer 60K, large location - 17 square miles, conservation land. many asymptomatic cases? tested?  amazing many people claim would fight die country, unwilling get shot wear fabric noses country. since I've fully vaccinated, I've gone back hanging local bar Jan 2020-March 2021. spend nearly time patio I'm thinking time go back isolation, basically. 

How risky one last hurrah tonight? Thanks friend. Reddit social media partake in, could probably use healthy dose putting often. surrounded people (family coworkers) either anti vax, Q conspiracy people, combo it’s getting exhausting. 

I also find hard faith even system raising broken people - it’s bunch people making decisions knowing hurt others without regard that. Idunno sorry rant can’t, logical compassionate person, understand this. seems possible can’t sure — remember Sweden, parts Brazil, parts America/Europe thought hit herd immunity previously, subsequent waves?

The data Pfizer Israel (decline antibodies) —if proven true— also coinciding delta, antibodies declining 6 months post vaccination, folks vaccinated early could susceptible.  know damn well seen explanations saying pure stupidity. know fucking fact seen someone list reasons ""just let be"" *problem*. Yet made aware view wrong, continue hold it. shit's america global laughing stock, got many people ignorant. independent leaned R. 
Did vote fake tan douche never would. pretty firmly camp point I’m thoroughly disgusted verbal diarrhea pouring majority Republicans mouths. 

I don’t insane. deadly regular strain unvaccinated people get stacked like never before, get it? 2/3rds Indians antibodies means Delta blew 900,000,000 people months killed ten times official tally. excess deaths India suggest number people killed covid around 4 million, 400k. We're fucked.

This already happening Missouri Alabama. Well, I'm catching it.  I'll wish good luck too. believe infecting people public ok? I’m sure you’re trying say. 

FTFY. makes extra silly people donate medical gofundmes ones oppose universal health care 😕 new information we're seeing mandates come play. June 2, 79% adults Mass least one dose. Reasonable assume second dose now. Given particular population study, completely reasonable could vaccinated higher average state.  vaccine proactive measure? data shows symptoms receiving 1st dose recovering? Oh ya? Where’s evidence that? India western country? ya'll tried shooting it? bunch wealthy folks see wealthy grow pandemic. so...maybe? really, obvious truth vaccines work people actually get them. Unfortunately vaxxed unvaxxed share public spaces together fucking accommodate even many literally kill us (I attacked wearing mask weeks ago that's lost patience lol).

Of course many unvaccinated people make point making. derailing vaccination campaign turn around use people masking protect bad decision evidence ""see told anything!""

I really buy idea changing guidelines confuses either. sounds like WIILFUL ignorance me, genuine confusion. Anyone willfully stupid could tell guidelines change situation changes. completely bad faith argument.

I'm 100% vaccine passport system. Fuck it. We've already shut everything name public health, let responsible ones waste another year lives real public health hazard (not taking vaccine) real incentive corrected. Minimal isnt zero. 👍 second part  piece shit correct, vaccines mentioned decades data back up.

That said, COVID vaccine far data short life would suggest. data clear vaccines extremely safe extremely effective (despite latest news delta variant). Again, correct, agree you, EUA vaccines used mean rushed unsafe. anti-COVID vaccine crowd isn’t quibbling FDA’s process, they’re fed BS whipped frenzy political purpose. mention children often mimic parents political beliefs. 

You know kids decide wear masks going get bullied they're ones. sad thing is, isn’t dumb. He’s acting dumb he’s accomplished man. I’m kind curious midterms shape many right dying hospitalized maybe realizing lied to.

I can’t imagine much enthusiasm them. asshole keeps blaming everything Federal Government time says wants Texas Texas affairs.

Then pulls shit like blaming COVID immigrants. hope catches new variant chokes it! Ya shit, thats *people electing them* need make health wellbeing focal point. Texas example this. Southern states always handled shit worse since started hitting them. par course. Stay Safe, good Redditor. mean, legally (if states) states make hard kick out. Look tenant rights state bullshit. I'm sorry deal covid shit roommate situation. one deserves that, especially time. Good luck searching let someone kick somewhere legally allowed be. want respect smart decision making (they masked well common areas etc) that's them. gf recently take care mom covid, we'd go house windows open, kn95 masks, cook meals, clean up, drop medicine water etc get there. Neither one us got sick time followed proper procedure mitigate risk (and I'm vaccinated Pfizer handled gathering laundry ""closer"" contact, gf got first shot things incredibly slow Mexico). you, part.  I’d say yes point inevitable. 
If vaccinated wouldn’t think need terrified infected. 
Concerned yes, terrified. 
Just lower risk level comfortable with, adjusting lifestyle align it. 

For likely going back set social bubble, grocery delivery service, hoping keep WFH, despite company finally officially rolling new policy office start date yesterday. 

If unmanageable level anxiety this, perhaps virtually speak someone (professional) able. 
I family member struggled major hypochondria issues throughout pandemic finally admitted themself mentally ill need help. 
Their anxiety straining family life needed attention. 
No shame it! Mmm wonder why….. paper says 88% cases asymptomatic 96% severe. There's top level comment source.  time today’s regularly scheduled cdc panic inducing info drop scheduled take place? change math vaccine defeating variant arises let Delta spread rampant among vaccinated population. Oh damnit Indiana fuck. agree 100%

This greater good. anti male laws strange sad flex. Didn’t Texas already school person last year? 
 
Also doubt masks make much difference you’re locked room 30 people day. That’ll gloriously floating around, doesn’t matter mask reducing initial spread distance. 
 
Edit: support wearing masks getting vaccinated.  Different hospitals use different code systems sometimes (although universal Code Blue).

I would guess code black code use mass casualty event, disaster event require diversion resources away non-emergent needs. Yes, vaccinated people probably still transmit virus cases, vast majority transmission, cases, hospitalizations occur among unvaccinated people. I'm anti-masker means, half country want take free easy precaution protect communities, blaming vaccinated people didn't/don't wear masks CDC said could essentially return life normal? anyone blame community transmission full hospitals still unvaccinated people. empathy different IMO. think Autism example. someone doesn’t need empathy racist. need ability think abstractly. comes regular exposure different cultures scenarios put someone’s shoes.

empathy reaction afterwards. feel thing someone else feels? able sense someone else’s emotional state feel thing? happen even without thinking abstractly.

for people two intertwined. abstract thoughts lead higher levels empathy vice-versa. seen numbers going US. leave one left around donate $ dumb ass Sounds like get CDC horn point authorize third doses. Since they’re consistently behind eight ball shit. actually fell like 10th fattest state people vaccines don’t even know fucking ribosome is. America monolith. Plenty Americans (probably 50%) agree saying. pockets weird, idiotic holdouts around country. Regardless vaccination wouldn’t happen without vaccines well? Reinfections natural immunity would result thing. I'm afraid we're going do. wife home full time thankfully, I'm sure handle another year teacher-mom 6 kids. Lmfao work fast food pro-trump anti-mask city. would like every days Im dont even car ever much would cost Uber actually program place [where rides donated people going get need free Uber! You’re missing point- even Delta spread areas like Northeast, impact wouldn’t nearly bad south since vax rates high. cases would minor, completely asymptomatic- means masking indoors necessary, although wouldn’t blame someone course. insanity. eight million (or 40%) already first jab, Australia literally halfway first jabs. Since Pfizer out, three weeks second shot. It’s easily doable even November/December.

Last week, Australia vaccines given ever. week even better, every day week since Tuesday vaccines ever given day.

Australia done messed D&amp;G coming Australians sub right odd given many vaccines coming country. rural voters ate up. Instead trying replace jobs coal cities decided poison rivers air really wish media CDC would honest. people scared making angry, people are, well already are, making scared helping anything. unvaccinated resistant population look sensationlism double reenforce distrust even more. many new unvaccinated people messaging actually reaching? I'm going say causing harm good limited perspective world lens that's see. one time. ICU physician here. We’re seeing lots late stage cancers could caught earlier acute exacerbations chronic diseases higher rate normal. consequence delayed treatment. Delta variant inadvertently scaring people getting vaccinated. Blyat..... Damn. eloquent description huge chunk population. wish exaggeration... know good answer that. I've seen people post FDA said boosters go full approval process, I've never seen links go mechanics accelerated approval regime. also possible different countries may may also pursue kind ""booster fast-track"".

My personal POV need figure pretty clear-cut way dramatically slash approval cycle time tweaks vaccine, takes year approve EUA updates, we're going perpetually locked losing race new variants. understanding actually updating ""code"" mRNA vaccines trivially easy, take much change production lines make variant-boosters. main bottleneck approval process. secondary bottleneck (at least 2021/2022) production boosters sufficient quantities blanket population again.  ClarkWayneBruceKent, biblical prophecy willfully ignorant going die pride able listen people's advice:

“They perish refused love truth saved. reason God sends powerful delusion believe lie condemned believed truth delighted wickedness”  
2 Thessalonians 2:10-12 I’m reposting comment. literally wrote many people first jab wrote numbers many people jabbed week. Please delete. Let's rollback seatbelt laws Bummer behind pay wall. vaccine efficacy go down? someone shows get tested hospitalized, I'm assuming we'd know whether they're vaccinated person likely say vaccinated order given proper treatment. goes double kicked fought vaccination... they'll want EVERYONE know right thing, got shot, still got sick. stops severe reactions enough. Hey look another half assed measure nothing... Baton rouge place coco cola bottling facility.....just putting there....been seeing Discovery channel lately...... Antivax sentiment strong Bulgaria Romania low vaccination rates remain problem future EU. still moving forward least. Yes, parents worked opposite shifts sister school full time old enough alone hours afterwards. extended family support help little, either.

Evenings, weekends, holidays - one parent usually always working job situation really improved gone 7 3-4 PM school. could work weekday 9-5 type jobs.

If waited years kids, better employed paid debt, would LOT easier us youngsters.

But birth control isn’t 100% effective, already given kid adoption lot pain that, abortion tough choice time. American, I’m embarrassed. People countries desperate vaccines huge supply can’t convince asshats get vaccinated. Oh yeah, that's best source ever. company makes product says works. Ask Washington Nationals well works. outbreak 11 infections. still doesn’t solve problem able homeschool kids parents sleep home. limits Democrat-led government encouraging pandemic spread among voters. Yes, want I'll want, telling track thoughts lead conclusion get vaccinated cretinous. keep suggesting we're trying feel smarter righteous unvaccinated people truth, thing care getting rid virus. pure pragmatism. course we're going resent sabotage chance recover rapidly pandemic. Damn miss series full world lockdown? Yet another reason avoid Texas giving away, places PAY take it. Republican Party dead. It’s literally party death ignorance now. soon locked down, spreads again. Unless plan going door door forcing needles people's arms said lockdown, delays inevitable. means new virus could spread though vaccinated population easily unvaccinated population.

It absolutely mean that; vaccines still effect infection, likely lower Delta. saying people get breakthrough infections transmit virus like unvaccinated people, vaccinated people spreading virus much unvaccinated people. Vaccines reduce chances catching it, reduces chances symptomatic catch importantly *greatly* reduces chances hospitalization death feel symptoms. Good luck one buddy. exactly it. How, kids still little need supervision? would sleep? 


Yep. one, chief. fuck? There's ""loller"" generation. shocking news  guy must fan snake oil charmer.  full lockdown stop spread. half assed one last year. 

Boogeyman word apparently nobody wants mention more. US data find recently Arkansas Ped hospital saying record admissions month including kids 12 kids without underlying health conditions. concerning. Well better hope enough, otherwise know stop it. Texas banned local mask mandates state never one again. Universal Orlando requiring masks customers neither Walmart, employees. need focus getting people vaccinated. matter takes.  won’t die hill, he’s leaving kids die place. article isn’t based actual human behavior. instance, Delta strain indeed easier transmit Chicken Pox, last mask mandate, wasn’t uncommon individuals enter restaurants, bars, clubs, move theaters, social gathering places proceed remove masks. happened everywhere every state. that’s case, mask mandates little success stopping spread Delta. reintroduction COVID lockdowns. That’s going happen that’s something ever support. 

I maintain data seen, best course action get vaccinated move on. COVID long term. I’m vaccinated every piece data shows chances ending hospital dead greatly reduced. Yes, virus mutate. way prevent point mandated, forced vaccinations. It’s spreading fast enough it’ll burn couple months scheduled october France. bother thoughts prayers. Plus, would make kid wear seatbelt ride safe vehicle. mandating masks school like speeding class seatbelt freedom. concrete vs abstract thinking. simply contain ability think abstracts terms.

“How would feel black house appraised half that?”

Concrete response:
“I’m black refinanced. make sense?”

Abstract:
“i never thought way. head let replace skin color pretend like got news home lost half value that. Wow would feel shitty. Man lady happened must feel really shitty.”

There numerous examples southern rural areas people completely unable think abstract terms. exposure. soon exposed personally effects racism, sexism, violence, discrimination, etc… things change. don’t exposed things think abstractly either. often confronted things, easier becomes think abstractly. 

The earlier better prevent cycle misinformation dangerous rhetoric literally gets people killed. Texas proverbial petri dish, environment hosts unvaccinated vaccinated split middle. This, combined absolutely mitigation policies much vaccinated people get virus possible, allowing possibility vaccine resistant variant emerge. exactly happens. found fast rate vaccination decreases probability emergence resistant strain,"" team results suggest policymakers individuals consider maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions transmission-reducing behaviors **throughout entire vaccination period**.""

So justification continued masking relies belief we're going substantially increase number people vaccinated, quickly. think that's wishful thinking grounded reality. Would stay inside Vermont there's bad air quality California? 18 months people still understand 7 day averages? worked retail, would honestly making effort stay inside working can, since testing positive could mean losing 10-14 days pay, there’s currently employment protections blue collar workers get infected. information what?? traded back forth themselves!!?? I'm thinking Delta surge 4-6 weeks based UK. We're pretty similar. that's guess. little restriction vaccinated people. free market force unvaccinated hands. It'll interesting August.  Requiring vaccination makes safe. masks security theater otherwise people eating drinking. baby dust way! Texas, get every bit bad karma deserve. never going end … it? Yes is. Substantial zone - bet many 60+ people though. Also people higher risk would less likely want spend hours packed bars, even vaccinated. 

I'm claiming hospitalization rate vaccinated people high... crowds Provincetown bars really representative sample public, that's I'm saying.  can't speak Canadian recommendations. giving direct answer question whether approved US. happens practices early research shows effective separate topics. think guidelines probably change soon, that's speculation 857,000 new shots, 563,000 first shots.  Highest total one day since July 1st. Damn, really wants constituents die. Oh sure you’re hypocrite far know sources remember seeing, talking hospitalizations include partly vaccinated adults vaccinated group, even though full immunity yet. article linked corrects false previous info says 60% unvaccinated. comment says, 88% adult population received least one vaccine. Also, children, know, thankfully rarely hospitalized. People end hospitalized vaccines mostly previously vulnerable groups - older underlying conditions. really 70/30 take everything account.
Another factor although virus infect vaccinated, spreads faster among unvaccinated, happens first. That's what's still happening US parts. UK initial situation same, changed. Unfortunately might change too, especially higher vaccinated areas. 
I understand concern, first read stats confused. read articles watched videos analyzed situation realized much nuance little understand. main stat everyone looking difference hospitalizations deaths UK wave previous one. Well, kind consider possible actions. 
I looking following:
 - roll back face face interaction friends 
 - already re-implemented masks even outdoors 
 - cancel summer camps 
 - think seriously / online schooling district fully killed virtual option  

There probably others, going forced make tough decisions. Tell more, seen yet. family TX. 😔 Yeah, really need block reddit again... Add South Carolina agree new mandates dumb, also don’t know it’s good idea governor state much power cities. Sleep weak. Ground Zero lets go!!! Masks required slow transmission point virus longer mutate variants. 

The scenario masking actually prevents mutations restricts R-number less 1.0. scenario, slows emergence. 

And looking recent case counts places like masking cultural norm, nearly politicized, look like masking reducing R-number much, all. 90% people UK Covid antibodies, mostly vaccination. weird turn fate shit hole state, Mississippi, one vaccinated states remember right. general vaccinations anyways, i'm sure Covid. Dummy grandpa died funeral probably week somewhere Salt Lake City. I'm vaccinated, since May, can't say I'm excited around bunch people Delta variant going around.

If go, pretty likely I'll exposed, right? know I'll protected, I'm still happy situation. lot people give shit COVID Utah...I since pandemic. Sweet home Alabama Vaccine mandates cruel. think also lot fact unlike previous pandemics-epidemics people know many people test +ve given area adjust behavior, leading yo-yo. people clue much spreading think virus would burn infecting many people. Meanwhile, California, school district sent ""share opinion"" type poll, see single person replying asking kids masked, receive outdoor instruction, etc. 

You get pay for.  

Part I'm paying neighbors. he's ""A Christian,"" supposedly. 88% symptomatic infections. Israel numbers bad. shut vax  seems ridiculous? That's precisely they're saying far read it.

If vaccinated, admitted hospital *for reason* positive COVID test, show data. Already peak oklahoma. value smaller populations seems... I’m saying it’s would situation, I’m claiming it’s actual workers currently doing. took Israeli study account noted outlier. known vaccines took hit comes preventing infections 75-85 percent bad. time Fauci said 60 percent would fine. still 90 percent effective severe cases though. That's natural selection works think here. stupid idea. Everyone delete Facebook sake mental health betterment society.  symptomatic? caused get tested? breaking immunity vaccines

You're getting downvoted nonsensical phrasing like this.

Variants slightly reduce efficacy vaccines, incredible effective merely effective. ""break immunity"" them. remember outrage closed beaches California, quickly backtracked public skewered them. playgrounds. 

Now, long pandemic, CDC deciding relenquish remaining credibility this.  People sticking head sand. try dismiss Israeli data keep saying UK Canada proven otherwise. fail see country different vaccine regimes USA followed Israeli regime closely. Thus, makes sense experience similar issues. 

The solution boost vulnerable populations NOW. wait data (because data there). People die suffer don't. waiting like message sends public good reason postpone. anything, tells NEVER trust message public health official again. kids planned combined household income six figures. daycare would cost mortgage, options move in-laws pay daycare. Cardiology. agree you.. ridiculous. Yeah, hoped improvement communication overall competence would seen old administration shown door. 
That hasn’t happened, CDC remains viewpoint organization deserving respect. 
Certainly smart individuals working there, public-facing among them. “Limited government” means “whatever level government Republicans happen control moment”. would think man paralyzed act god would empathy developed years.  going get lot people killed. Disproportionately GOP voters... R value thing?  explained solution. Iowa. Thanks, COVID Kim Reynolds! they, though? area near 100% compliance masks winter, still, cases went haywire. Masks work great comes models, real world application nearly impressive. People still allowed wear masks volition gather :) hypothetical new mask mandate decent compliance (I.e majority country following it, excluding obvious anti-lockdown state holdouts), lasted 6 months longer, think average person would throw hands accept masks gonna part life going forward. 

Social media echo chamber, average American likely comply basis “it is” there’s point starting conflict masks. got back getting Moderna shot Walmart. first two Pfizer jabs back March... That's adorable, somehow managed sound like dependapotamous wearing spouse's rank commissary checkout line. “personal choice” assholes ones claim bigger patriots George Washington don’t give damn anyone else country  Ya think?  Yes thank you. Poor mean stupid.

I sadly know many college educated, decently paid people unvaccinated various reasons. Yeah weird. think people far excited fantasy eternal pandemic useless vaccines genuinely interested what's best societal compromise going forward dealing something that's never going away (but manageable vaccines).

The vaccine dialogue baffles well - people hate anti-vaxxers love emphasise feels like every case breakthrough infection occasional death vaccinated person. seems like mostly feeding superiority complexes anything else. we're going see even cases states like anyone warn us?!?! Sigh... Except deluge misinformation virus vaccine part job absolutely control narrative. nation’s premier public health agency say say matters. crisis communication need message clear, concise, consistent been. both. 
My main point though things it. 
We can’t guarantee won’t get it, take steps drastically lower chances happening. 
This plan! It’s really people sad things changing they’re ready accept it. Extremely low. Indoor dining movies still me. Risk infection == exposure duration X exposure severity. shoes? planning address fact schools don’t allow parents choice whether children wear shoes school? Right? read one articles today; know yet. I'm wishing anything I'm pointing solution people act like there. Albeit sketchy one. Yeah, really great stopping first time. That's we're pandemic anymore! quit, make enough money support Texas care anything it. least, that's think quit. believe neighbors dog 🐕 tells do. Woof. 86 year old mom COPD, almost 20yo niece genetic metabolic disorder multiple organ transplants. They're vaccinated vulnerable kind data really matters families like mine. mess. 🤦‍♀️ trying figure own. amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  crazy conservatives. small government. Wait... They’re attempting avoid base rate fallacy, failing need factors weigh current CDC data shows 75-85% infection 90+% hospitalization deaths Clearly nobody listening get vaccinated lol understand sentiment. deployed? got ridiculous amount vaccine shots deploying single day. saving Covid marriage. problem country many people okay Covid outside marriage.  Lol vaccinated people get covid fear mongering get unvaccinated get vaccinated everyone knows vaccinated people get sick bad got vaccine Deltas already burned UK without overwhelming deaths hospitalizations. concerned Republicans literally picked hill die on. You’ll never get 70% vaccination unless force people get it. think analysis flawed couple ways.

First, Gottlieb said winter wave, thinks capturing ~1/2 cases.

Second, importantly, deaths (hopefully) won’t scale way, unvaccinated people lower risk groups. death rates groups still high—they get vaccinated eligible—but much smaller.

Thus, ratio deaths/cases lower was. see clearly UK data, I’m pulling things nowhere. Yep, bullies still bully kids things like cough spit part bullying. Hey, us countries shit rollout . able go home get vaccinated, husband stuck working come with. city Japan, vouchers/coupon make eligible get vaccinated age group arrived (my FIL's age group came last week). actually anti-mask mandate. Preventing school districts mandating masks students. Diatribe? Triggered? Bruh, get dictionary. shit fucking Alabama.....

Ranked 46th Education
Ranked 45th Healthcare
7th highest poverty rate
7th highest unemployment rate

That combination conducive good decision making. information outdated. recent CDC leaked documents giving delta R factor 10 higher. contagious chickenpox. protection getting infected starting appear way lower 80-90%. even sort super lockdown vaccination entire world would together. never happen. Covid forever. Get vaccinated move on. Ok ok Yes, exactly. Government limited. I'm getting downvoted folks disagree policy, limited government. Common sense rarest thing Texas. That's really boils to. Sitting back watching narrative implode measure # Total Covid Hospitalizations (923 Yesterday), people COVID. report 410 total breakthrough cases hospitalized, COVID? Even seems ridiculous, county 5M vaccinated, roughly 1/2 hospitalizations CAUSES vaccinated. Thus, number thousands DAILY. Says guy got vaccine generally stays isolated public.  completely get it. latest CDC guidance affects anti-vaxxers least pisses lot people off. tend live areas chance mask mandates anyway, going affect fully vaccinated people living responsible states. symptoms could mean small cough  I've honestly shocked response NJ masks day one. part, high compliance. Absurdly high. vaccines 65 older KNOW fact good number Fox News loving Republicans. 

I can't grasp even people family make perfect sense talking COVID, masking, make ""I told friend better get shots we're seeing anymore"" type statements... go right back echo chamber everything else. 

I am, however, thankful they've chosen let go one thing keep safe families. Redditor r/FloridaCoronavirus saying [code black going 2 days ago. cited various employees meetings talking it.  Jacobson vs Massachusetts would like word...  rush bottom list things ""ethically scientifically void"" I'm unaware of?

I feel like everyday state something dumb regards Covid. Texas like ""hold beer"" Thank this! bring another excellent point forgotten about. regard viral load, slides referencing India, US terms vaccination vaccines used. It’s comparing apples oranges. Two completely different scenarios two countries. early? school year duration Arizona? looks like knew otherwise hid it. We're finding stuff leaked internal memo, apparently?

For fucks sake that's true .... never end. already new mutations way. Soon evade current vaccines almost completly. Oh sure.  look data, research, makes sense. respect Dr. Fauci, don’t worship either. reasons I’ve already explained, disagree suggestions won’t wear mask places isn’t required it’s safe to. it’s private business? Isn’t like “we reserve right refuse service” “no shirt shoes service”? mean province basically said care covid anymore think concerned valid. guarantee months fewer expected children die, years evident long Covid symptoms life. course matter republicans use ""survival rate"" evidence right. office since March 2020. opened first time 3 months ago. supposed voluntarily upload vaccine card. need go back. far 5% office even back office day. supposed start new hybrid work setup September office 2-3 days week.

Apple Google delayed back office October. I'm fairly sure company follow same. conspiracy rabbit hole never fucking end. “Evidence” liberals guess. people unvaccinated people ignoring safeguards across country anyway there’s much difference there. Many care, CDC guidance affects least. majority live areas chance mask mandates. gonna learn severe infection delta. know whats good would get vaccinated hits them. There’s third country willing die get back office. he’s prison, running 2024. 
Republicans seen get away anything, they’ll going full steam ahead. 
I’d relieved proved wrong. one side benefit blue town residents probably smart enough still mask even though vaccinated. 

I got two shots months ago, wife still mask step out, even wearing cloth mask one filter. 

Anything better nothing. Schools open week parents start pulling kids covid infections class. Same. kid two October. Hopefully, shortly vaccine available 2-5 age group get it. guarantee people parroting migrants line everywhere vaccinated themselves. Guarantee. bad misread comment people say Fed can't tell states mandate, say states control local cities towns. Inconsistency much? need overruled federal level requiring masks schools. Florida Texas kind deathmatch lose. That's article saying. Good. Let Darwinism thing. covid.  long term symptom noticed poo smells like pickled onions. honest, kind like it...

I completely lost sense taste smell, think recovered nerves brain connections grew back slightly different arrangement. wife finds smells disgusting previous enjoyed. Issue fancy perfumes bought. Gf family tested positive within week seeing one another. She, mum bro exhibiting symptoms, latter two bedbound. Luckily gf gad first vaccination help fight off.

Honestly barely holding together, want nothing go get look 24/7. can’t. American stupidity gonna end civilization know it.

Ive pretty uncommon experience rollover car accident. Covid US feels like hit car starting roll. late anything hit car technically totaled yet, near future completely fucked unusable. 

The US rolling car purpose thinking going drive-able get come rest rightside up. not. going back undamaged car. another said, didn’t get kid I’d seriously consider getting it. born 92, didn’t get kid, get sometime around 18 remember correctly. Maybe going college, maybe high school, either way recommended get certain age since hadn’t gotten natural infection kid. know deleting Facebook new version ""Kill Television"" life really much better getting rid it. account years know missed damn thing. I'm still touch people matter. longer hear incessant bad takes people matter. Explain numbers UK India crashing delta? So, answer. I'm trying engage conversation deflected got defensive, hoped I'd realize ""my end goal everybody else's"" answer. ignores people different ideas acceptable end goal looks like. So, I'll ask again, what's end goal? Yes meant say symptoms. Doctors observing ICUs good sources information, see worst cases. need widespread data draw conclusions, [like concludes ""vast majority ICU patients covid unvaccinated."" year half bucking whatever medical experts say, almost Texas Governor wants Texans die. Well well well consequences actions. watch vote guy wants cut medicaid!!!! here. I'm tired things going here. one thing politics, another edicts like intentionally designed place lives risk. employees hate also. going work hospital shit hits fan? ok getting spreading old immune compromised person getting dying? Cool Florida: “Hold margarita” Tread harder daddy Meanwhile, Texas governor doubles ""fuck kids"" Arkansas considering repealing it’s law banning local school mask mandates. Things getting bad. Pediatric ICU filling nursing shortages. Another article read today said Arkansas seeing kids 12 kids without underlying health conditions ICU Covid. pure evil wrong. shamed, especially since many children going school fall maskless unvaxxed. Really really heartbreaking. wish COVID anyone hope children unvaxxed change mind right get vaxxed stay masked. Governor banned mask mandates vaccine mandates thinks cracking migrants help It’ll alright, hope, kids know take masks, Wash hands, go grabbing people’s things. They’ve always way even aware. Plus, wear masks fine go anywhere, complaining. It’s lot kids parents dirty don’t care. curious affect voting map elections next years. 

A lot republican voters dying, states already marginal differences outcomes. 

Even GOP changing it’s tune vaccines month - it’s kinda late clearly isn’t enough convince base. 

Expecting lot desperate gerrymandering coming years. concert end next month I'm fully vaxxed concerns you. finally feeling good couple months ago started seeing Delta wave coming knew things gonna get shitty bit. much want go like it'll fine! know amount anxiety I'll feel cases still high ruin experience. feel bad anxiety keeps going. people understand appreciate want spread little ones! It’s going end hybrid herd immunity- mix vaccinations natural immunity, I’m tired people pushing restrictions pretending like they’re anything making take longer get there. is?

I'll give guys hint. Nothing. lot people actually virus dormant bodies. individuals, covid must something causes trigger. seems racist considering POC lowest rates SARS-CoV-2 retrovirus COVID-19 mRNA vaccines don’t make reverse transcriptase. contain one gene -- gene SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein. Dude obviously username checks out. wanna point unrealistic offer “get vaccinated” “not around people foreseeable future” solutions.

First all, people compromised immune systems can’t get vaccine, among many people conditions. COVID obviously throttles even worse.

Secondly, live here? Lol Texas possible survive without making contact people? Get clue man. Abbott playing politics that’s it. odd Texas constitution written specifically prevent Governor controlling smaller municipalities across board. Good, stay home scared get vaccine. masks schools governor wants to.over turn vs wade. Means knows science looking higher office. /s big government. big government too! Wow, awesome. hope adopted cities. wore mask working flatten curve protect hospitals buy time got vaccine. Sorry, lifetime masking something I'm willing do, vast majority people. completely free mask life afraid sniffles, I'll get flu covid shots live small risk diseases present like live risk tons things life. CDC prematurely declared vaccinated individuals need wear masks.

Data come vaccinated individuals spreading Delta variant.

Do think CDC botch anything made premature recommendation? vaccination rates suddenly spike CDC made change. Peer pressure real palpable, could right. come many big box stores mandate masks customers. think know coming days ones won't. hope right :) anti-california people moved Texas - how's going? Enjoying less taxes little Covid? Same. legitmately hard one. 

Little kids, masks shit. They're going fiddle non-stop, likely forget wear etc. 

8-high school. Less issue, 12, 12 vaccinated. (Which thing).

High school, put fucking mask on. wear mask going wear condom responsibilities easily expected teenagers modern life. 

The schools going back ""distance"" learning option either IMO. work well. 

If Az didnt' cut funding year year year, MIGHT able less 30 kids 50 sq ft room though. Fucking Az....  count Georgia out, want party too. First step sowing doubt, two steps. Texas honest answer absolutely people agree him. Although think majority, many us hate man. Poc? Yes. everything can. vaccines. reason vaccines answer immunity answer, people come covid, immunity is. outbreaks centered areas low vaccination rates, i.e. low immunity. variant runs covid-naive bodies infect, we'll reach end tunnel. hate much. niece 6 diabetic. Every day get worried could get sick shit happens. Elimination completely unrealistic societal cost would worse virus. Masks effective reducing R0 virus, R0 Delta insanely high people need realistic much masks help. may able reduce infection factor 4 perfect 100% use, attainable, cutting R0 Delta like 5 10 still leaves virus 2 times contagious Alpha. Vaccines far away important masks. hopefully low enough forget theyre antivax We’re talking mask MANDATE, nothing stopping wearing mask nothing going force to. pretty line Texas libertarian thinking. Yeah that’s less saying. Saban really smart guy also pretty humble considering success, might know would surround people listen I’m sick willfully unvaccinated shitheads. wish could make life impossible since they’re hell bent making situation equally impossible. Let’s start hiking insurance rates roof. smoker considered “at-risk” unvaccinated person “at-nuclear-risk” also need start thinking overall risk. 88% efficacy og covid much better 88% efficacy Delta Delta twice transmissible. Efficacy end all.

BUT overall risk infected relatively low (especially weekly), maybe one wants look like they're downplaying covid. Guess can't handle truth.

BUT worst looking absolute risk either vaccinated unvaxxed group passing efficacy. absolutely call used pro- anti-vaxxers. Austin wasnt able before. vaccinated interested watch this. long pretty enlightening.   lucky, already one day infected manage completely asymptomatic.. Hopefully neighbors, coworkers, friends, family contact expose luck live thankfully. I'm BC right late fall. Hopefully shit go hill drive get back Ontario. think that's optimistic take. bet Republicans want virus spread, hopes Dems enact stay home orders people lose jobs can't pay rent/mortgage, housing market rich people buy everything up. Yep, let’s remove vaccine requirements it. Polio, meningitis etc.

But let’s still force people wear school uniforms prevent wearing short skirts.

Because hypocrisy…  Don’t realize need get shots go school US? I'm worried kids going back 10th FL. would suggest people like me? wife work kids can’t unsupervised used proud Texan. anymore. embarrassment state becoming. pockets weird idiotic holdouts almost last election. underestimate numbers. don’t know expect say. necessity current circumstances. point vaccinated then? I've vaccinated tons things (military), never got vaccinated against. areas diseases vaccinated around... never got anything. 
I mean Covid vaccine risks blood clots, cardiomyopathy, PE's, etc... protecting you... Earth risk that? Understandable, limited data long covid among vaccinated individuals, symptoms tend typical post viral symptoms, like fatigue, persistent cough, joint pain soreness. Certainly wouldn’t want that, compared long term symptoms unvaccinated folks get, seems preferable.  guess people dying mean anything... WCGW Right?! fight tooth nail pro-covid policies guns, legalizing weed?? Nah. Letting woman control body? Nah. rural North Alabama personal experience vaccine shaming, rhetoric turned virus fake claiming death real. It’s literally gonna take massive deaths area even won’t believe it. It’s fucking crazy. got vaccine got berated half coworkers got COVID earlier year. Unreal. We’re trying. Time tell we’re successful. people hesitant completely anti Seatbelts benefit 1 person. body flying windshield projectile kill someone else. read commenting on? People didn’t take vaccine hospitalized COVID realize serious since it’s affecting personally regret getting vaccine. 

The information danger it’s already affected millions people. point people understand seeing others go people don’t seem capable comprehending they’re hospital deathbed. 

If read people thinking need forgo beliefs appease them, think you’re missing point. like seeing semi-truck train crossing, driver knows drive crossing arms refuses anyways, can't help pull phone start recording know going shit show. ~~Dignity~~ Regret empty sack, worth sack.

Rule Acquisition 109.  never used Facebook first place. told roommate get vaccinated move reading this....but mostly comments vaccinated people getting fucked... Maybe I'm asshole, idc. told didnt right tell do, doesnt right put wife pets extra risk already are. literally changed gyms, sleeping schedule, almost entire life actually, workout 3am person there. gf go time they're unvaccinated...I'm tired mad people close wife dont seem give fuck immunocompromised ass lives dies. Least educated state union. tracks open schools. Literally watching train wreck happen. Serious question, tipping point exponential growth it’s late action choice … let burn out? ask feels like there’s several states, Louisiana, Florida couple serious trouble there’s little mitigation efforts. feels like people misinterpreted saying, hey typical Reddit hivemind mentality. That’s dumbest people live south. 

Source: live south people make clear can’t follow basic instructions everything. Good time re-opening schools 12 allowed get vaccine. Nurgle pleased Abott know people work foreign company company sponsored flights come get vaxxed. show there’s lines anything, go in, get vaccine, fly home. It’s ridiculous point we’re hoarding them. I'm wearing masks protect anti vaxxers especially outdoors So...never visit Texas Florida again. That's I'm getting ass-backwards executive orders. sad could prevented.

I'm medical person family members are. Thank amazing things do. national championship want, guys! Ugh! Alabama worst state right well?

Stay safe. ❤ see relative risk better, without reference absolute risk even useful. iirc unvaccinated person 0.06% catching 3x likely. absolute risk least gives reference point evaluate (0 100), 3x likely vaccinated person tell much anything without reference much absolute risk vaccinated person. agree you. It’s half assed advice worse took month long even give half assed recommendations. It’s like haven’t seen coming months seen India, Israel, UK etc. CDC response time future variants screwed. mask mandate= Pro-Covid Yeah agree u said. Long term outlook fine. short term still could obstacles. Right summer vacation time China, tons parents children traveling.   good😂 thing work lot older people (who vaccinated). 

But whyyyyyyyy.. **think** (not 100% sure) comparing apples apples.

In imgur link, think thats total cumulative hospitalization throughout week vaccinated people. 123 vaccinated went hospitalize last week data.

You going dashboard - think showing many currently hospital all. 7/22 645, 7/29 918. mean 273 people went hospital week - currently there. possible throughout week 1,000 people went hospital 727 left period, end net 273.

So comparing cumulative hospitalization vaccinated current hospitalization both. would want compare cumulative vaccinated cumulative time period “Pro-Covid” OOF. I’m stealing that. completely insane framing ""the unvaccinated"" 86% world population Delta emerged India vaccines widely available there.

The reality Biden administration business interests tried rush reopening blew faces, now, they're trying shift blame whatever way can. Unless they're going border quarantines, we're going breakthrough infections globally-emergent variants years come. 73 hospitals LA County. Hospitals 100s admits PER DAY. Half LA County Vaccinated. possible these, say 5000 daily hospitalizations LA County (So 35,000 1 week), 123 vaccinated. 

You think realistically arguing absurd is. Yup. freedom want, long it’s ok’d government…. Oh /facepalm completely agree, mods contribute climate. literally banned “fearmongering” saying “a bad feeling” Delta variant months ago, fight get reversed. gobsmacked - I’m fully vaccinated, pro-science get, even contracted COVID last fall got double pneumonia it. pretty disgusted whole situation. 

But anyway, totally agree take. HCM City (VNS/VNA) - Patients with locally acquired COVID-19 showing symptoms, with no underlying disease or obesity, a 14-day home quarantine, according new guidelines released the Ho Chi Minh City Department Health on July 29.

HCM City urges vaccinations 62,000 shippers

The HCM City Department Industry Trade asked city’s Health Department prioritise 62,000 shippers for vaccinations.

Director of city’s Department Industry Trade Bui Ta Hoang Vu said department compiled list shippers sent Department Health, along People’s Committees districts Thu Duc city vaccinations.

Dr Bui Thi Thu Huong Viet Nga Eye Hospital HCM City, charge one five injection points District 7, said addition shippers, many store employees pharmacy staff were vaccinated.

""It crucial be vaccinated high risk COVID-19 infection,"" added./.  What's even crazier Republicans **love** ""tough talk."" Yep, saw elsewhere replying you. 
What missing though chicken pox 10-12 chart fully unmitigated. 
In practice like 3-6. thread

Sorry guy jerk, since seems engaging good faith. 


I think idea COULD continue mask 2-3 months, spend time trying get another 10-20% vaccinated, bit closer vaccines kids, etc. idea probably slowing things get bit closer using remaining weapons we're waiting on. 


I'm saying that's right choice, tend agree stuff saying, think there's ""right"" solution right now, rather okay ones various faults flaws.  Chise coming again! don’t see 1 million per day. look uk extensive testing, peaked near 50k per day dropped. multiply 5 estimated equivalent US 250k cases. US deaths per day much UK upswing could assume US cases also unvaccinated lead deaths. Also, deaths per day US started higher number wave never UK style restrictions summer. doubt US 500k per day may surpass 200k confirmed cases within next 3 weeks. Oof. comment aged well move Florida 15 years ago teach. left 2 years. one worst states live teach in, sane person knows gotten far far worse since then. probably seen reports Israel low vaccine effectiveness wave. Delta? Waning immunity? think reason mostly got denominator wrong.

From Assistant Professor Aran Lab states pretty much ones would expect. Car crashes contagious . cousin kissin' What's point vaccinated wear mask step outside house lol

Serious making great way discourage vaccines that's they're suggesting. They're implementing mask mandates that's it, totally ignoring fact masks part puzzle last year literally impossible isolate real-world effectiveness NPIs. clownery. Wel wahlah....means traitor people Source? getting moderate treatment put ICUs? last words were, ‘Mama can’t breathe,’” Ms. Jones said.

Imagine living that. got vaccinated convince daughter. ""guarantee"" this? actually realized mistake - axios info based unvaccinated americans. So, african americans may make largest # unvaccinated currently (or time study anyhow), also make largest # plan get vaccinated. Okay, spent childhood Texas moving PNW. probably means missed lot political nuance time, truthfully, Texas also different place twenty years ago.

However…

The Texas know individuality fault. boldness, grit, willingness summon inner cowpoke bully arise. don’t see translates Abbott’s response here. Texan communities allowed choose whether they’ll pass legislation protect biggest, baddest bully around home front right — COVID. fact, Abbott nothing he’d still able say giving Texans ability choose. he’s not. He’s restricting would choose masked community. would choose medical professionals aren’t actively contaminating patients COVID refuse get vaccinated.

Texas faults lived there, also pride. Where’d go? Corrected headline: “Pro-Covid Governor Refuses Let Masks Get Way Chaos Death” Broken link, I've read things talking about. know, general, group studies one find similar results, likely 1 outlier error they're finding something everyone else missed. Please rally together, especially positive. Christian follows teachings Christ. fail meeting potential goodness idiot deliberately ignorant kill people run office. We're China America   leaving decision wear mask unvaccinated 15 year old school smart thing do. order prevents organizations buildings do. That’s limited government. enforcing preferences every town, city school letting tame proper precautions community outbreak. Hell go ahead approve booster. That's crazy story sad, hope gets better all. I'm Scandinavian problems pandemic antivaxxers generally trust medical professionals I'd say. Absolutely. theater. discovered @Chise twitter another thread. supposedly well versed disease interesting take CDC’s data. Check out. I”m vouching well thought well backed statement.  Reddit Get Together Alabama next week? I'm sorry going this. hope kids feel better soon. live Arizona equally ridiculous things happening. Schools allowed require masks even quarantine kids. governors dreadful people. agree, definitely overboard reaction!! Thanks sharing. 

I think concern fever coughing. guess need trust tests accurate. I’m aware vaccination rates increases likely Delta slow down. long think vaccines improve children 12 under? it.

Mask up? Listen, truly want lower risk level, stay away others. Specifically, avoid prolonged close contact poorly ventilated indoor spaces. Masks magic totem confer immunity wearer. exception properly fitted worn N95. Sigh… life living constant fear virus 99% people survive. perish often suffer self inflicted co morbidities like obesity high blood pressure. I’m done sacrificing protect people. though.

See easy make point without resorting ad hominem attack? middle school level debate skills don’t suit well mean people werent gonna wear mask still arent might give booster. guess want ""buy"" Western countries even Fuson invested early stage. Quite political reasons Study: Vaccinated people carry much virus documents obtained Washington Post. note, COVID-19 vaccines still highly effective delta variant preventing serious illness death. metric useful; think fact dealt flu heart disease CENTURIES. course caught war death.

Wearing mask doesn’t protect you, getting shot protects you. way think is: someone shooting protect tin tea cup (mask) Kevlar body armor. either one still take bullet one offers much protection. 

Make people get shots over. us shots it’s over. start “think children” nonsense look numbers, kids don’t get often bad. real surge unvaccinated adults. Correction, breakthrough Alpha infections. I'll mosey r-conservative see say about-

**[HOLY state/local health department know better grumpy redditors, delta changed math, math vary one place another depending community profile transmission rates. need mask forever. would weird. Depends. super big would say anywhere 10-30 people depending night. random sampling. 

But yeah, without new testing Vax mandates, hard see. Luckily we're getting mandates we'll probably start see reports asymptomatic vaxed testing positive soon. High risk customers option using pickup delivery services. High risk employees don’t choice going work. again, retail workers get shaft. hell would ever live Texas? biggest buffons government there.

Oh wait - residents voted dumbasses. Idk who's dumber. % elderly immuno-compromised?  Republicans continue show big loser crybabies are. even equally, pfizer vaccine seems retain 75% efficacy rate infection U.S delta variant. 25% accounts breakthrough cases vast majority mild. Even Delta, virus shown nearly impossible fully contain quarantines. Australia almost exactly describe, Delta still made through. New Zealand succeeded far, bubble could pop day.

I know fun point out, sometimes left get distracted obvious disingenuousness Republicans. think intentional distraction Ah, right. Ignorant, hateful morons plummet steady descent madness degeneracy...and ***their*** fault? 

#LOL hate Simone Biles now, too. vast majority people catching spreading covid unvaccinated. Especially Delta much transmissible need much people vaccinated possible. 70% won’t cut anymore reach herd immunity. P-Town data study skewed town’s incredibly high vaccination rate. look covid map NYT website you’ll see biggest outbreaks happening unvaccinated areas. Massachusetts outbreak tiny comparison. virus, it’s even real first place, NATURAL. /s Governor Abbott really wants constituents die, apparently. crowded patio? Ocrevus, this. worked me. I’ll keep fingers crossed you! ""Texans... individual right responsibility decide children whether wear masks, open businesses, engage leisure activities.""

My point (to original commenter responded to): would hate Abbott big government policy, pro-big government yourself? Yes hypocrite, isn’t good thing something “big government”, something supported along? also takes time vaccine work. takes two weeks first dose get protection another two weeks second dose. Altogether six weeks achieve full vaccination.  might change autumn approaches convince people vaccinate. passed 50% mark due low interest, supply enough month half already.

I’m quite confident isn’t banning vaccine. People still get want. vaccine nothing slow delta transmission, lessen symptoms. herd immunity vaccines don’t work that. much “big government” letting towns cities decide what’s right  13 year old great kid really proud! Good luck year, got little guy start kindergarten I'm terrified. saying CDC saying. shield Covid, immunity Covid. Get facts straight stop spreading misinformation.  Congratulations.

He’s severely ill! joke people. Mask up! give zero shits anyone thinks mask looks stupid know it’s stupid selfish. Uh, government could technologies things pretend exist! seen Independence Day?

/s schools different summer camps right? left leaning citizens eager vaccinate? communities would see less damage...like lot less. Seems kinda dumb.  surprised ight bans since seem even worse last year child. would told people would making laws actively spread disease, would told there's way humans stupid. keep telling self law makers following voters stay power. costco pretending like pandemic over. could still happen.

Same - his, he's :) Trying say, point things actually quite safe open things fully.
Take account flu deaths recorded last 1 1/2 years? (please correct im wrong? )

Corona blasted news 24/7 thus people think stil problem, actually currently low corona virus(flu included) related deaths. 

Im saying wasnt bad start. Im say saying OVER. Ah yeah! US likes take lot risks transmission apparently. Cases deaths pretty high there, makes sense. love hearing people say requiring people receive vaccines un-American, un-patriotic.

Good ole' George Washington wholeheartedly disagrees - get American forcing inoculations (the OG vaccine) citizens - replace coronavirus smallpox.

""On 6th January 1777, George Washington wrote Dr. William Shippen Jr., ordering inoculate forces came Philadelphia. explained that: ""Necessity authorizes seems require measure, disorder infect Army . . . dread it, Sword Enemy.""

Source: think cdc put new information refuting that. Said vaccinated folks spreading much non vaccinated. Hence request vaccinated folks put masks back on.

Apathy certainly common among people know plan get vaccinated Enforcement: act compelling observance compliance law, rule, obligation.

Public shaming enforce law powerful oldest form enforcement. DC reinstating Ok go wear mask rest life might happen 5 10 years now.

Or even year!  time last year easing restrictions preaching summer 2021 time finally defeated. 

I even feel comfortable next week out. city here? Cases rising 10% previous days' total. mathematical rate us end August highest December peak. 

I'm terrified. Israel’s data showing? “Delta variant” section assumptions stated slide. Also provide overview there. needs work way courts. way telling private business conditions employment access mandate legal. Period. Lol fuck dumbass fr “Marlene got COVID cured addiction social media! hasn’t posted thing since got it!” it’s like jumping airplane without parachute. parachute, would jump airplane without parachute?” Asked Nafziger.

You mean government issued bondage vest? Nobody gonna force wear 40 pound backpack. fell pool? weight would drag drown me. sniper wants shoot me? think wanna slowly floating towards ground give 'em easy shot? way. I'm jumping plane without overbearing interference thank much. think legs anyways? land ground, silly! ever jump couch kid? Jeez. Except 90% seniors 70% adults least 1 shot (and 1 shot still quite strong hospitalization death), we'll see far lower levels death. virus quickly run vulnerable people. mother upset got vaccine soon could back March. basically told tough, opinion wrong, immediately changed subject.  New Jersey highest covid death rate country. two countries higher death rate New Jersey. sure happy. country way now? recently went Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, bit Idaho I'd say maybe 1 10 people wearing mask, that. signs say unvaccinated wear mask still someone getting vaccine likely wearing masks. yeah havent seen Covid precautions anywhere I've country 3 4 months. Mask up, vaccinated not. trying fat shame anything like covid not-obese would one way improve likely outcome caught it. Also covid aside likely make transition middle age old age lot nicer vis vis mobility independence. whole thing started doctor told since kid daycare would probably ok caught covid. many colds caught 2018-2020 including one January 2020. 

I caught covid April 2020 felt like dogshit totally week. Barely even coughed. fever headache. “bUT PcR tESt FlaWEd!” 

That’s thing now. sure. anecdotally, anti-covid vaxx folks know personally circling wagons since they've tied idiotic stance personality. They're ready die hill. really sucks since includes direct family well friends, neighbors, coworkers, etc. Tigers could walking street eating people certain governors would like ""Animal control wants us put tigers cages, that's ridiculous. Cages work. Sure want tigers gone, big deal, go life get eaten tiger. We're great.""  Honestly, might thing Missouri needs. smart person might actually get people. 


I trying overly-optimistic. Pathetic. many people? I’m bad math. Would expressed x^17? Gods would nice take birth control. get COVID shot set life! thing never team effort anyhow.

Yep. That's point. Delta brought alarmists especially claiming vaccines offer little protection infection variant. article helps offer perspective numbers we're dealing even though breakthrough cases might trending upwards, rates still low still high protection infection, hospitalization/death. Must nice loons running asylum. Honestly though, fantastic news world; people vaccinated, better. agree gap seems closing 20% week week drop now. quote “Although African-American men participated study told receiving free health care federal government United States, not.” hate like ""BUT ACTCHUALLY"" depending car accident joe wearing seatbelt gets car accident Samantha, body could jolt around car severely injure kill samantha, seatbelt none wasn’t call last time CAs. FL may viral thunderdome CA far proactive government. Nope. ""Terms"" mean nothing vs national security.  Vaccine hesitance disproportionally common among poor, often get free healthcare Medicaid, pay hospital would persuaded hundred dollars. aunty said facebook vaccine killed twice many!!!! wish they’d require proof vaccination. Eating huge part experience. CDC fucking joke give CEO huge raise worth tens millions dollars? article mention tax increase based policies specify desirable programs go underfunded? city already haven’t heard anything. feed troll. block it. predicted well Olympics started. Bringing thousands people around globe central city pandemic. could possibly go wrong?

This outcome surprising one. It’s mainly whether want acknowledge not, section population believes keeping lockdowns table essential “taking pandemic seriously”. 

I’d say there’s good chance it’s rhetoric appeal people. realize intentions good here, I'm 60, vaxxed, still worried long covid. (I lost 20 pounds last couple months I'm working another big risk factor) ROLL TIDE (of covid cases) 😷 Well, brother gets it, sister gets it, gives sister brother, siblings give kids after... mixes school children .. wait school starts back weeks state governors forbidding masks school. Hmmm... Gotta shorten up. Depends expectations are:

If zero covid yes end all

If expecting never get covid lifetime disappointed likely.

If make mental peace fact may get lifetime long get vaccinated age 80 circumstances either like mild cold severe flu. exactly feel. spent 18 fucking years hoping freedom got college taken away year half. might well try next life. UK 6 percent people vaccinated US whole… survival rate get put ventilator Covid something around 20%. chances good. feel wish we’re bold headed ass it. Arkansas says “Thank God we’re 48th everything, Mississippi always worse us” Bumbles, like call been, Brayden?

I Cayden, Emma, Bella Godsgift, hanging two hundred friends movie theater, mom.

You didn’t sneak get vaccine, you?

No mom. real president Jesus, wouldn’t want that. 

Ok.  Well case, bring fridge magnet check arm. state regulations prohibiting local regulations hypocritical? net effect fewer regulations, would line deregulation... This. wish others going life everything back normal again. guess that's point. asymptomatic getting tested right now? Thank you! Non-Self Centered Thinking? Alabama export? Guessing prices may start rise. Wait…. grow third arm?! 

BRB, gonna get another vaccine…. Isn’t empathy? here. kiwi tons vitamin C delicious. I've eating ton since whole shit storm started, along exercising eating better general. virus nightmare... also look large group DC well...The dangerous em all. right paid people administration decided ignore half took seriously. right supported workplace received letter remove signage website inside/outside building requiring masks. taken someone reported us. 

This happened found positive COVID cases within staff. employees refuse miss work despite sick can't force anyone leave. definitely visitors close contact many employees. 

People also refuse provide contact information let can't contact they've exposed. Unfortunately, also stopped contacting anyone may exposed many stopped caring. side effects second shot? wonder expect them. seems like South Park episode. fucking backwards. seems like relying Indian study retracted. need see data. ridiculous won’t show public data   Evolution virus give fuck feeling either. Good riddance. Lots colds affect sense smell taste, covid much severe one think Delta, least concerning variant, already identified rare careful. can't go sauntering forest fire expect escape unburned wearing flame-retardant suit. 

If sharing air infectious person, *will* infected, vaccinated not. Vaccines buy time, front-line defenses overwhelmed Delta's massive viral doses give chance. They’re going fine. flu worse kids Wow terrible article. don’t even talk R#. Since beginning covid-19 higher R# influenza. graph following Wikipedia article great table graph R# common infections. cold somebody else kinda difficult wash hands aren’t right facing breathing air. exactly worried article. basically saying give up, every person end. 4th July put us trajectory rough winter. Deaths economic stalls future I've saying quite conundrum crowd. either going admit lied intentionally harmed trusted leaders told virus ho@x reject vaccine thus mortally betrayed, think trusted leaders ""been gotten to"" trying get take poisonous vaccine. 

Because reasonable thing, admit wrong, right thing going forward. *That* bridge far! Hopefully long time ago Threw mine away never buying another read yesterday breakthroughs less likely lead long covid. find article again, I'll link it. I'll keep watching hospitalizations ICU. Cases important leading indicator fully vaxxed ppl getting virus get breakthrough hospitalized, we're still business. paper cited long section covers protection. Rather try summarize it, pasted entire section below. 

PPE

In section, study whether face mask likely decrease chance potentially susceptible mask wearer becoming infected. use mask wearing potentially susceptible people known “PPE.” Protection wearer challenging source control, since particles interest smaller. also much harder directly test mask efficacy PPE using human subject, simulations must used instead. Masks made different materials designs (66) influence filtering capability.

There two considerations looking efficacy: 1) filtration material 2) fit design. many standards around world issues, US National Institute Occupational Safety Health (NIOSH) N95 classification. “95” designation means that, subjected testing, respirator blocks least 95% small (0.3 μm) test particles. NIOSH tests flow rates 85 L/min, simulating high work rate, order magnitude higher rest low-intensity breathing. designed tests worst case (i.e., produces maximum filter penetration), test conditions severe likely encountered work environment (85). tests use particles much smaller virus-carrying emissions, much higher flow rates normally seen community settings, means masks meet standard may effective PPE community. machines used studies specifically designed looking respirators hold shape, glued attached beeswax firmly testing plate. Flexible masks cloth surgical masks get pulled hole testing plate, makes less suitable testing method designs.

A study filtration using NIOSH approach (86), 78-nm particles, used basis table World Health Organization’s “Advice use masks context COVID-19” (87). 90% penetration cotton masks handkerchiefs, 50 60% penetration surgical masks nonwoven nonmedical masks. Zhao et al. (88) used similar approach, lower 32 L/min (which still 3 6 times higher human ventilation light work). also tested materials creating triboelectric effect rubbing material latex glove 30 s, finding polyester achieved quality factor (Q) 40 kP/a, nearly 10 times higher surgical mask. Without triboelectric charging, achieved Q 6.8, similar cotton t-shirt. concluded cotton, polyester, polypropylene multilayered structures meet even exceed efficiency materials used medical face masks. However, depends details material treatment.

One recent study looked aerosol filtration efficiency common fabrics used respiratory cloth masks, finding efficacy varied widely, 12 99.9%, flow rates lower at-rest respiration (89). Many materials ≥96% filtration efficacy particles μm, including 600 threads per inch cotton, cotton quilt, cotton layered chiffon, silk, flannel. combination materials effective materials own. findings support studies reported 1926 Wu Lien Teh (4), described silk face covering flannel added mouth nose highly effective pneumonic plague.

There many designs cloth masks, widely varying levels fit. tests different designs. simple mask cut t-shirt achieved fit score 67, offering substantial protection challenge aerosol showing good fit minimal leakage (90). One study looked unfitted surgical masks, used three rubber bands paper clip improve fit (91). 11 subjects test passed N95 fit test using approach. Wu Lien Teh noted rubber support could provide good fit, although recommended silk covering whole head (and flannel sewed nose mouth areas), holes eyes, tucked shirt, comfortable approach provide good protection whole day (4).

Research focused aerosol exposure found types masks least somewhat effective protecting wearer. Van der Sande et al. (78) found “all types masks reduced aerosol exposure, relatively stable time, unaffected duration wear type activity,” concluded “any type general mask use likely decrease viral exposure infection risk population level, despite imperfect fit imperfect adherence.”

The review Chu et al. (11) included three observational studies face mask use SARS-CoV-2 health care environments, showing risk ratio 0.03 0.04. However, studies given much lower weight review studies Middle East respiratory syndrome SARS, overall risk ratio mask use health care estimated 0.30.

One frequently mentioned, misinterpreted, papers evaluating cloth masks PPE health care workers one MacIntyre et al. (25). study compared “surgical mask” group, received two new masks per day, “cloth mask” group received five masks entire 4-wk period required wear masks day, “control group,” used masks compliance existing hospital protocols, authors describe “very high level mask use.” “no mask” control group deemed “unethical.” study inform policy pertaining public mask wearing compared absence masks community setting. found group regular supply new surgical masks day significantly lower infection rhinovirus group wore limited supply cloth masks, consistent studies show surgical masks provide poor filtration rhinovirus, compared seasonal coronaviruses (67).

Most research masks health worker PPE focuses influenza, though yet known extent findings influenza studies apply COVID-19 filtration. Wilkes et al. (92) found “filtration performance pleated hydrophobic membrane filters demonstrated markedly greater electrostatic filters.” metaanalysis N95 respirators compared surgical masks (93) found “the use N95 respirators compared surgical masks associated lower risk laboratory-confirmed influenza.” Radonovich et al. (94) found, outpatient setting, “use N95 respirators, compared medical masks outpatient setting resulted significant difference rates laboratory-confirmed influenza.”

One possible additional benefit masks PPE allow hands directly touch nose mouth, may transmission vector. lipid barrier protects viruses destroyed within 5 min touching hands (95), wearing mask period could protective. However, case reports laboratory evidence suggest touching mask cause infection.

Overall, appears cloth face covers provide good fit filtration PPE community contexts, results vary depending material design, way used, setting used. would want save anyone would amenable that? Low chance point, still chance. human brain simultaneously marvel universe complexity *and* capable whatever roomate We’re #1!!!! Unfortunately people going think death faked deep state something like gurgle gurgle glub. pre delta internal document, mean someone within organization tipped Washington post? hard fake true southern accent y'all say like Republicans burn Democratic ballots middle street broad daylight enough votes ""win"".  don't. long-term effect salutary.

We need see data, aren’t releasing it? ridiculous Thanks, here's hoping continue recover. theory vascular dementia - multiple tiny blood clots like 'jar head' experienced put heart-lung machine open heart surgery. think research points inflammatory pathology. long Covid alarms think quite rare (?). I've encountered one case ER work. seemed okay conversation unable return work. brain black box. way. nothing else. hope lot Zero-covid crowd seriously wake delusional fantasy:

**Covid going endemic. going get maybe multiple times lifetimes. Vaccination THING help us.** Vaccination next 2-3 years like measles chickenpox. like advanced version flu vaccine. Maybe next generation vaccines provide sterilizing immunity. worried vaccine. may feel little tired couple days, normal. matter you’ve vaccines. extremely unlikely allergic, reason make wait around 15-30 minutes after. start coughing alert medical staff they’ll inject epinephrine you’ll fine within couple minutes. way we're transitioning one getting people immunity, either vaccination natural immunity. one major themes covid era. Scientists institutions slow design. good thing. slowness also means people rely science/institutions flexible adapting changing recommendations. 

We treat science like politics- change signals weakness evidence past deceit. 

Covid great opportunity build social organization necessary combat future crisis, worry opposite effect instead built social neural networks used deny next crisis. legitimately afraid. fear response through. surprised, two articles incidents involving (note, subscribe NYT): right protests happening European countries well, international embarrassment. consider ""center"" attention right acting way towards vaccine possibly ridiculous thing ever witness thus far (and believe strange things come time passes... always do) Yep. lot places specifically don’t ask IDs want everyone, including undocumented immigrants, get them. Thank posting this. missed report. Pretty much take too. Vaccinated masking Welcome. I, others, hating since April..April 2020. far useless infection data shows. Remember vaccines released Fauci said would happy 60 percent effectiveness? think like said fight going getting people take vaccines. right, can’t afford leave 50 percent. Also protection hospitalization higher 83 percent study. sucks. insurance support may word that. must senior leader ANTIVA. feel like they're testing less symptom-less people states. Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi greater rates new COVID cases week. supposedly Bear Week P-Town, covid outbreak amongst vaccinated people lead CDC believe vaccine still extremely EXTREMELY effective hospitalizations deaths, might effective transmission delta variant. letting boss control personal health decisions

Just wait hear wonderful healthcare system boss full control health insurance vaccines work vaccinated scared unvaccinated?

Yeah I'm scared. lick sample COVID-19 lol. I'm scared *of* you. part scared *for* you, feel like innate empathy wasted time. anger point, since could moving much quickly drink much kool-aid.

My friend lupus, get medicine ya'll would rather *pay* hydroxychloroquine get *free* vaccine. vaccines safer hydroxychloroquine - many 'safe' 'effective' drugs pretty terrible you, reported neuropsychiatric adverse effects hydroxychloroquine use include agitation, mania, difficulty sleeping, hallucinations, psychosis, catatonia, paranoia, depression, suicidal thoughts. Hydroxychloroquine implicated cases serious skin reactions Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Drug reaction eosinophilia systemic symptoms. Reported blood abnormalities use include lymphopenia, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytosis.

Wanting take *that* instead (much safer) vaccine little bonkers IMO. Even prevents death, better safer cheaper accessible vaccine. also (most importantly IMO) reduce likelihood giving COVID grandma, grandpa, friend lupus. Personally want responsible anyone's death - whatever likelihood - guess YMMV.

I get - devout contrarian once, living best life. Getting vaccine end world big deal think is. Honestly force you, please try spread COVID if/when end getting it. honestly know should, I'd you. Vaccines still effective. need people get them. Vaccine mandates/requirements become norm now. France UK already equivalent (i.e. make life difficult unvaxxed folks). Many companies city/state governments US already it. Nobody's surprised, right? Yep, know someone regularly visits Germany business company based there. said knew several Germans flew get vaccinated USA. paying this? Yes, obviously vaccine safe US let people use it, that's information antivax people going see. way “filled” article claims.

The article contain word ""filled"". reading much word ""fills"" headline - saying beds *filled*, saying Delta variant *is filling* them, is.

It's *filling* them, they're yet *filled*. 

""Fills"" perhaps best choice word clarity, that's headlines written. Headline sometimes ambiguous, nature limited space, hence tendency short words ""action"" verbs (""SLAMS"", ""DESTROYS"") overall make hyperbolic mode expression. Knuckle draggers ignoble fate. fucked CDC believes effectiveness vaccines infection 75-85 percent delta. super great far useless square one anything. remember Fauci said vaccine 60 percent effectiveness would great. Yo doctor dumb AF It’s question many. It’s question long. need 12 month trial data, that’s done right now. Y’all I’ve using NYT get case counts afternoon updated don’t match state reported numbers. Ex Missouri state reported 2k cases NYT report says 5k. use case counts? plenty evidence. science change, virus changed. watch Israel; started 3rd doses ages 60+ raffle 30% members only, waiting? situation convinces people get vaccinated, hubris suffered vain. people seem get first part. I'm young vaccinated, already survived virus. even remotely scared myself, I'm particularly scared vaccinated people either, given *extremely* low hospitalization death rates among vaccinated. I'm concerned continuing spread virus, potential keep mutating, potential kill immunocompromised people, yes, potential continue killing unvaccinated people. Sure, majority unvaccinated people made choice take risk, mean want die.

It's scared myself. That's also wear mask (some people *still* understand purpose masks, exception N95s such, protect others you, vice versa). I'm afraid getting COVID. I'm concerned people still risk greatly suffering dying it. Smoke like hundreds times smaller viral particles (not mention ones contained droplets exhaled moisture). Yeah, drive luxury vehicle, cannot switch delivering food. decent replacement income. mean, least learned dumb mistakes. I’ve heard plenty stories people intensive care COVID still say wouldn’t get vaccinated. got mess it’s problem. Please don’t leave state spread COVID/stupidity Alabama. May rest population get vaccinated it’s late delta variant coronavirus appears cause severe illness earlier variants spreads easily chickenpox, according internal federal health document

Winter coming. Again.

We almost lmfao.  Nah man, he’s idiot. wouldn’t fought cancer ready go correct, skepticism heart science. let rephrase pedantic: *tons* evidence showing current US-approved vaccines causing ADE way. 

All data points consistent, high degree protection severe disease every currently known variants concern. rare deaths occurring frequent weakest immune system (very frail elderly underlying immunocompromised issues). ADE would result opposite effect: strongest immune responses would highest risk ADE-related disease aggravation. It’s $100 NYC. profit! Oh well ways highest rate post secondary education per capita Canada....not like Bama'

We Premier grade 5 education. first dose AZ second mRNA extremely good. Get first dose asap.  guess FL AL (and rest) mistaken Delta football. Grudge match! want win!

Go Gators! 😷 Go, team!! 🐊

/s There's leap logic. coincidence sudden GOP strongholds seeing voter bases incur higher rates hospitalization test positives they're suddenly jumping board w/ getting vaccination numbers up. especially need corporate donations ever failed attempt temper Covid first started.

The majority people misinformed refuse get vaccinated Red voting districts. They've refused acknowledge vaccinations work, entire country suffering it. Someone gets covid mild symptoms may never get tested infected would never show logged case. Similarly wife tests positive start showing symptoms may count positive without getting official test showing official case count. Situations 100% testing (like prisons cruise ships) give estimates fatality rate versus total infections.  dope

other gig jobs like instacart might poppin case numbers go next lockdown.


good luck stay brotha slowly, compared states. IIRC we're 10th bottom terms case growth. look particular counties got hit hard back Spring, thumb, they're great. Huron, Sanilac, St. Clair especially awful shape, case counts pegged floor. doesn’t matter spread? That’s literally bad unvaccinated person spreading Tell anyone circle isn’t vaccinated get vaccinated. longer afford awkwardly silent, tacit approval. jerk. Start argument. Put pressure them. “Dude. It’s time get vaccinated.” Don’t let go don’t give blow you. waiting throw horseshit around, you? sitting there, desperate, looking opportunity pretend situation purely black white. 

The reason vaccinated people still getting sick *is because* unvaccinated people. room full vaccinated people spreading covid like trying bounce golf ball Solo cup across room filled basketballs-sure, possible, pretty unlikely. Put sick unvaxxer like stand front cup toss directly. moved US eyes opened assisting poor folks (at least time met them, worked asses decades) folks bankruptcy 20 years ago. CDC spiked koolaid. Singapore, Australia, India telling everyone bad Delta is. Bama like, Mississippi covid19 variant? Hold beer 🍺 Roll mf tide voters like dead? ars technica article bot hates reason:

The USDA also took reasonable precautions make sure data accurate. Agency scientists tested samples around prior pandemic confirm rate false positives low (it was). researchers also ran antibody tests using two different machines make sure conclusion due sort hardware problem (it wasn't). likelihood, large number deer exposed virus. Uber Maybe, maybe, people relying advice healthful living wonder died following advice. knows?  much whole Republicans small government thing... *Herman Cain enters chat.* It’s guaranteed it— plenty stories people get confirmed COVID-positive partners. Regarding long term studies vaccines… several based vaccine tech that’s used decades. main thing would cause deleterious effects would non-active ingredients (eg solution carries vaccine preservatives). look decades data that. mRNA vaccines, tested many years viruses again, parts could cause bad reactions would buffering solution preservatives. look whether might reaction. (If haven’t reaction previously vaccine it’s super unlikely arise COVID ones). mRNA lipid vesicles get broken recycled naturally within hours normal cellular processes. 

Not mention, billions people gotten vaccinated going back year. We’d know serious long term effects now. we’ve identified addressed (blood clotting AZ rare cases, example). doctor knows history able help gauge you’re risk (I’m betting aren’t). Oh well authoritarian surprising since easiest catch COVID family members Roll Tide! never recommended taking masks. always wear mine. standard vaccines prevent infection disease? think finna comes ""fixin' to"" though Florida: Hold ventilator. way everything else, spending millions upon millions half assed It’s time tax fuck churches. wife’s family’s small church attend infrequently mentioned trump last time went parents. Fuck them.  Yes, exact situation 4 days ago. Took home test, +, pcr, also +. First night felt exactly like night vaccine comments churches Facebook page full “please pray family member, put ventilators” it’s sad I’m pissed selfish people state couldn’t bothered contribute public health. 

We homeschool last year we’re excited back real school, point I’m terrified. School starts 2 weeks one kids higher-risk young vaccinated. sure do. care? trying flippant, nearly everyone zero immunity choice. Children still lower risk flu. matter anymore? 1300+ comments daily thread, again. trend continues. somebody make flattening curve style daily thread comments chart? bet it’d get ton upvotes. doctors Israel even agree conclusions based see ground. Thanks award!!! guys talking tough liquor department suspends liquor license keep serving, they'll learn real quick. California screw around comes serving liquor without license. They'll couple night ABC raid them, take LIQUOR (Yes, even fancy wine) order electrical company turn power. never heard something like ending well defiant restaurant owner. sure?? way..wikipedia never wrong!!!! Thanks sooooo helpful answer. someone lives Huntsville, AL hurts bit. Home NASA Marshall, Redstone Arsenal, FBI lots big aerospace industry. 

We're vaccinated county state btw. We're surrounded 😳 also one dumbest states.  I'm super glad read this. interview week wondering would in-person feeling bit nervous. omfg.

Even did, doesn't, would impact cells mRNA gotten into. would what? Make look like infected cell?

Lern 2 PhD student. Last weekend concert oak mountain amphitheater. pretty packed. touted first concert since covid started, tons people showed up. masks anything. least open air guess. Thanks posting! Really interesting read, would encourage everyone skim full deck.  can/does. virus replicates less vaccinated individuals, (by 100x vaccinated individuals infected less replication equates decreased likelihood escape variant higher fitness variant population vaccinated versus unvaccinated people. point, think every little bit helps. Agree need folk vaccinated, also agree masks really good idea right now, especially N95 better. Apparently anti-masking moderator support r/Coronavirus even though CDC already recommends masking public high Delta transmission areas, us live soon almost us will. CDC may soon move universal masking recommendation. 

But saying kind, compassionate, responsible thing get thanks here. Sorry. History shows nature points folly men wow seems unreal. mean like, going 5/5 vaccine breaks vaccine 80 90% effective feels like something really reporting local public health officials BSing us.  PCR positivity also plummeting UK vaccination rates 18-30 still something like 70% first dose. family. also kids 12 get vaccine. severely sick month solution also isnt vaccine works moot. mean shit, won’t tell mom, don’t want hear man. work Canada it, 2 hours pay first 2 hours pay second, still holdouts. 


I wonder reasons were, wanted either bigger incentive, trust it,  


Knowing people work, actually going bigger incentive. immediate family motley crew sure, thank lord we're page vaccines Covid (only one member currently unvaccinated - 9!) Logically saddling generation people crushing debt improve economic activity, good everyone. Without crushing debt, people go places buy things before. Huh? Ok ret*rd! want new EUA treatments?  longer goes on, ammo give anti vax folks.

It feels like they're making go.   bet makes skin crawl 16 unvaxxed members family hopping flight island florida Saturday enjoy family vacation like last year, year that……  Nice cherry-picking, let's continue Martin McKee, professor European public health London School Hygiene Tropical Medicine, said doubted Britain reaching population herd immunity, part wouldn’t explain regional differences. “I don’t simple answer, none us do,” said.

The decline strange, matter opinion vaccines are. love vaccines biggest proponent let's realistic data.   jersey daughter. Mums word. approve message.

Honestly, way we’re going get certain folks vaxxed make crappy annoying unvaxxed. Well, don’t stay night thinking you, hope family remain safe healthy. Fuck federal workers. want salaries paid tax payer, need bare minimum protect health tax payer. ""nobody else"" exaggerating make point many people seen social media talking getting vaccinated. bit disingenuous. state California population 5% greater entire country Canada. percentages Canadian people 12 older fully vaccinated less California. 

It might useful compare BC like, SF Bay Area. SF Bay Area still 50% higher population BC similarly high percentage vaccinated residents. exactly. Fox News took q context supposed drink beer sore shoulder? fact sheet data (top right) - masks - fairly useless

Surgical masks - OK-ish

N95 - decent protection lot people including family member think u get shot longer get Covid. 

Isn't shot supposed help milder covid side effect catch ?  Welcome logic behind paying student loans people willingly chose go debt work pay off. Currently fighting one HELLOVA cold gives hope. point vaccines enough people become immune, either vaccine repeated exposure. Unlike polio vaccine, mRNA vaccines stop someone vaccinated share viral load onto others. 70% us together. It’s still front page subreddit. lmao. hell people? say everyone able get vaccine. like advice better Good luck building funds leave shit hole wut lol Imagine letting boss control personal health decisions times except makeup chair, eating/drinking front camera. Nah get mate. guess America would still wearing mask inside I’ll take “things never happen” 1,000 Alex. bad actually meant 17 times. suppose still huge amount operate C19 airborne discount fomites/droplets-inside-2m claims WHO.  Can’t find non Twitter link White House states lockdowns aren’t table yet. Shout people Missouri proud, masked vaxxed

Ehh, vaxxed. Give us options simple. I’ll take inactived vaccine like COVAXIN day. that. inhumane.

However *should* substantially raise insurance deductible possibly monthly premiums people chose remain unvaccinated. Let people carry economic burden poor choices. Depends mask. Cloth gaiters bandanas, basically protection. Fitted cloth masks, bit better. Surgical mask, pretty good, many gaps defeat it. Well fitted kn95 kf94, excellent protection. Well fitted n95, best protection basic mask. sources this? Really interesting look socioeconomics pandemic. Appreciate  many bacterias carrying dude?

'Big Loads'

This headline gives headache. Definitely. Can’t wait see reaction can’t even leave home anymore LOL agree. Give strong incentive get vaccinated like German UK (or soon). Restaurants (for indoor dining) bars good start, groceries no. Maybe let people eat even choose get vaccinated. Tell say bullshit like God gave vision future saw world ruin brought covid way kill evil everybody get shot. God actually exist, would thing got reserved spot heaven. fake holier thou followers get reservations simply pretending believe follow holy book lol saying comes mind ""you whatever want life long prepared accept consequences""

Take shot, go indoors

No shot, enjoy ambience tent Florida heat

Other take away, build something permanent lot people dead near future anyways. vacant buildings. can't breath sickest ever been. new dude holy shit. link research even better, post it? whatever 3M leaked river.  “Your motivation role is: you’re young starlet finally broke get leading part Broadway, you’re willing throw away one last shot broken glass lung MRI!” guy congregation Locke said, “If go round two start showing masks nonsense, I’ll ask leave. ask leave. playing Democrat games church. want social distance, go First Baptist Church, don’t come one.” We're reddit, /r/coronavirus, /r/daytonabeach. We're speaking general things apply US. Maybe things different locale much bearing us responsible average states. feel full antivaxxing Florida mans direct national policy lead public discourse. people need assisted self-care community obligations looong leaving parents. CDC expected release new study saying vaccinated folks spreading Delta. Fucking sucks. couldn’t care less willingly unvaccinated, really feel bad Oh, sorry right. article says donate vaccines, guess automatically thought Pfizer. That's get reading article. She’ll get tired testing get vaccinated likely. Nothing jog belief system like inconvenience. don’t care got vaccinated tell hide from. get vaccine dipshits Sounds like comment, 3% (which less 50%). “No one knows whats vaccine” drinking monster energy drink. Imagine losing Olympic dream Facebook meme convinced vaccine government plot something. fence, rural area, got first shot. 29/m. Think ton like getting now.  don’t see much distinction two. someone says “I trust science”, comes across others kind like religious person saying “I faith”. Please don't, sane people live states also, it'd absurd doom terrible people neighbors. Ah yes, people sing 8 shows week living want risk never full use lungs again. teachers count staff? secret? I'm pretty sure vax publicized. Oh crap, done? Seems like WANT true. Otherwise, idea
how vague story makes think    Cases UK slightly last two days course highlighted news. Guardian interviews professor intensive care medicine HAAAD include this.

**Montgomery, 58, said believe life would return normal lifetime people would remain cautious, adding mask wearing continue hopefully people try live lives outside.** fact printed segment article...what joke. hyperbolic fucking nonsense. Hard say. Alabama lower vaccination rate, Florida DeSantis. Good. Let gods save them. way title worded, sounds like unvaccinated person vaccinated person get tested, unvaccinated person 17 times likely. time read article right now, someone correct headline wrong. haven’t spoken vaccine that’s body? That’s wild. perfect overall think good job regards restrictions vaccinations. Maryland regarded one top states handling covid, especially factor demographics population density. dinosaurs pray? No. still exist? Checkmate atheists. (Just case anyone needs /s). Well need exposure infections problem wasn’t bad. CDC/FDA messaging shit. think might hit one shot goal debacle.  chart article showing 126 ICU right now, compared 132 last summer, 192 January. Mink, cats, deer, bats. Hopefully turns common cold good knows many waves. Sowner later going catch People leave. probably unvaccinated people hanging increasing risk anyway. Mild symptoms studies showing loss brain tissue symptomatic Covid? ok mentally killing entire generation? Sorry. going prevalent image. Thanks letting know things Huntsville. (I'm American, btw.) yup, feel like im living different fucking WORLD like 99% people know, politicians, work friends literally watched China get fucked January 2019, thought myself, holy fuck, going get decimated.

-Telling friends family Feb. going biggest thing generation ever seen.

I'm always surprised friends learning vaccinated people even get infected all.) post says 1/3 get mRna vaccine, could part it.

The numbers know Pfizer Moderna Here's cases last 14 days age vaccination status. 

There kids affected Delta, anyone needing supplementary oxygen ICU 18 years age. Hospitalizations great measure Singapore lot pre-emptive hospitalization case someone asymptomatic perceived risk severe outcomes. Compassion led thousands people fates like his.

I cannot wear jeans shorts restaurant dress code. different vaccine masks? Great, go tell family this. Covid kind lobbying power Republican Party something?? benefitting BS virus. Ok Reddit told medical system like 1000000x better USA general feeling nothing ever right.

To find divine. live Portugal, Delta variant already took responsible 99% covid cases. 50% population fully vaxxed 70% least one dose. Covid cases dropping vaccines avoiding deaths. Breakthrough cases hit fragile people (who may need third dose) vaccines preventing deaths hospitalization. month half ago kept posting Delta rendered vaccines useless getting fed media. Reality proved otherwise. 
The virus become endemic vaccines allow that. avoid getting covid getting vaxxed. probably asymptomatic really mild case. natural immunity reached without filling hospitals. That's end goal. Covid go away. become virus circulates get while. fragile need yearly boosters prevent death. 
Calm down, trust vaccines get anxious. Things get better

I actually know situation like. Sturgis seems good comparison. gay male compadres would assume gay men pretty contact heavy (for better word) say large group men woman would be. man may gay certainly understand male sex drive. 

This would good CDC rec large gatherings sure like sturgis said. Feel free correct mean insulting! Yeah... Cause got hit first vaccine variety treatments available. stay home son keep safe get health insurance case one us gets Covid?

Ugh. I'm sorry make tough decision. One many reasons hate employer-based healthcare system. countering point I’m making, using argument doesn’t apply.

You’re saying “everyone’s vaccinated, course greater proportion cases”. get that. isn’t I’m saying.

Someone saying “most vaccinated people won’t symptomatic”. quite large instance, were.

I don’t know you’re lol. One time might make difference either way.

On hand, drinking home cheaper, bar tender attractive. Second shot us J&amp;J people. show vaccines effective delta variant.

At all. acknowledge breakthrough infection means fuck all,

If delta variant, would say correct. looks like breakthrough infected vaccinated people also spread it. spread it, means hospitalizations deaths among unvaccinated. That's difference. people spread previously thought. right actually change much, except indoor masking compliance. evidence vaccine would ever help kids? thought lack evidence one major reason's approved them.

So sit around wondering going approved hard even measure going effective. Nothing seems point major solution. tucker carlson said …

/s degree statistics work analyst ...

Appeal authority logical fallacy. I'm well aware works. Claiming hide spike trends average absolutely incorrect unless looking something like 3-day ""spike"" - basically irrelevant talking long term trends. 

That's long way saying ""I admit I'm wrong"" particularly since hiding shorter term spike EXACTLY talking COVID. plenty examples rapid sampling governments tried hide sharp measured rise nitrates, pollution, radiation, etc. clear discernible rise non-random fluctuations could washed longer average delayed reports. Interestingly - look fact COVID 3-5 day incubation period start see rise rates starting day 3 superspreader event discernible spike happening 5-7 days second one 10-14 days. ... EXACTLY seen DAILY reporting elections MI several states, seen sturgis event SD, etc. etc. etc. There's reason almost meaningful Covid reporting uses rolling, weekly averages daily fluctuations. Hey, fucked up? population percentages people vaccinated. it’s really:

-	39% Pfizer (34% cases)
-	26% Moderna (28% cases)
-	5% J&amp;J (12% cases)
-	30% vaccine (26% cases)

This single event, can’t really use draw conclusions vaccine efficacy. bro it’s 90-95% infection. CDC said so. never wrong late. Stop trying think yourself. case studies bulletproof Remeber started greater good un-vaxxed deaths 100% Okay even encouraged sub. Lol quick tune changes good point there. Definitely get 3rd dose foreign land naturalized citizen.

I'm US born here, feel risk deported.

I'm 45 years old, diabetic, and, medical definition, obese.

With rates infection Delta, numbers people hospital/ICU, among scary stats Delta, figured risk worth taking get 3rd dose.

I think I'm entitled anything. think I'm special, way Americans run front line soon line forms cause backups shortages, felt like going would helpful. keep safe turn keep everyone else safe around me. best answer protecting kids, want outside, healthy, able develop healthy social skills CANNOT pretend like inherent danger pretending like world normal KNOW adult world not.  


Is ""right"" answer locking kids? right answer risking choking death  fluids avoid either . great many employees qualify food stamps medical well state supports... rather livable wage totally meaningless, would know basic grasp statistics.

The release study horrific misstep CDC. infuriating. like virus zombies, stupid die waves. Shortness breath severe symptom. That’s common vaccinated. internet shitty since got vaccine. I'm sure access microchip free 5G. recognize commenter post data back claim ""same people donate medical gofundmes ones oppose universal health care"" - sole experience confirm/refute correlation exist. Thank response. happen know study cites reduced viral load asymptomatic cases?

Yikes, someone make typo entering data this? What's deal? We’re 71% one dose 50-64 age group. Higher age group. masks.. get vaxxed mask up. that's way. silly, headline says texting hospital bed dead, ascended many kids die every year car seat? 9000 kids age 12 die every year car crashes, lets say half car seat 4500 died one. That’s still 25-30x amount kids died USA coronavirus. (About 200) “preventable” yet stuff happens anyway. sounds callous, shutting society people die moronic without clear end. I'm sure years people getting covid flu calling either one flu. think there's zero guidance pushback government bringing people back offices even worse. argument made person schooling necessary right mix precautions. 

No argument made stopping WFH proven better company employees last year. cases, better. 

If, whatever reason, choose two, think school way. MANY NYC offices opening September vast majority NYC commuters use trains buses. old (not new old, lol) Penn Station NJ Transit commuters wait track assignments enter narrow stairwells droves hours end one worst Petri dishes America. worse even kids school parents going work they're school two potential vectors colliding daily. least masks school limited outside gathering vaccinations approved 12 bit practice control. Going back work offices sit eight plus hours poorly ventilated spaces poorly ventilated transit systems take HOURS slightest hiccup? 

No thanks...

And week, Cuomo said would like NYC businesses office space mandate return Labor Day. 

Here go again... Pretty much country 80%+ people willing get vaccinated let anywhere near many people die past 18 months. isn’t requiring 1.6 million U.S. workers

Holy shit. US roughly 207 million working age adults. fudging numbers mentally I'm coming figure suggests 1 every ~120 people (working age) country work Wal-Mart. Correct I'm wrong. That's insane. want get policy disagreement counter sub's commenting rules. say trust thought leaders CDC think would well amplify bandwidth. Elimination happen. Smallpox disease we've wiped out, possible generated permanent immunity, needed dose person once.

The true diseases we've ""all-but-wiped-out"" first world. Polio Measles big bother us need one shot we're kids permanent immunity.

We already know COVID-19 reinfection breakthrough cases exist, immunity lifelong. alone makes exponentially difficult.

Good luck getting world agree mass culling cats. What's source vaccinated asymptomatic spread? Thotts prerrs facility healthcare worker that's vaccinated tested. vaccine mandate tbh testing mandate unvaccinated workers screenings rarely enforced. dept supervisor looked like 2 heads said still get regularly tested own. I'm sure breakthrough cases way widespread even know.

I’m sure want backlash, would huge boon getting vaccines there. UK much better vaccination number, reckon.  vaccine mandate dominoes started falling week, think they're going continue rapid pace next weeks. big players set precedent, lots employers going follow quickly. think they're done playing games this, hurts bottom line.

It's case what's good corporations (people vaccinated) also good rest us. would imagine isolated 16 months also nightmare. 🤷 Ouch. got find way teach people better critical thinking skills.  kids could read would upset right now.

It’s pretty cowardly think locking kids 2 years neglecting education socialization risk compared something that’s twice deadly flu. Less cases among vaccinated well fact asymptomatic mean less contagious someone symptoms. Viral load factor determining contagious individual is.

An 80 yo woman remembers vaccines different periods time, studied etc, refuses take vaccine ""God-given immunity antibodies."" went tangent really. 

Same woman asked gov't allowing illegal aliens country pass us diseases. health care department screen first allowing country. (It like blaming COVID them.) asked ""Christian tax dollars"" going towards immigrants them?  governor seemed died inside bit. 

My suddenly said, Let virus them. Darwinism point. Unfortunately, he's done. influence still enormous large part base. Better question rate transmission among vaccinated people.
Vaccinated people spreading due symptoms there’s that. suppose could. hard say sovereign states would consider person health threat getting 3rd (or beyond) vaccination.

You're supposed lift mask take bites, put back chew food. future boldly claim virus hoax never vaccinated Yea do. think need invest teachers education general (Dr. Jennifer Nuzoo John Hopkins School Health) discouraged organizations — like pro baseball teams — surveillance testing among vaccinated people without symptoms, saying “it probably harm good” eroding public confidence. 

I agree sentiment. Early wise play bit shell game breakthrough cases keep motivation high getting vaccinated. shell become kind transparent, though, new data emerges--such high viral load vaccinated breakthroughs clear cases vaccinated people spreading other--a different strategy required. think seeing scrambling week. 

The important thing circle wagons around whatever official messaging is. looks like common theme unvaccinated people putting big strain capabilities vaccine. That's I'm going go anyway. ""gas $3/gal last week $2.50! want refund!"" vaccines work vaccinated scared unvaccinated? Pooled testing. Usually one test bundle per class. think likely plan. update you! ended giving monoclonal antibody infusion discharged hours ago. entered ER around 3am left around 4pm. oxygen levels dropping given IV sucked ass nurse missed vein first time account shaking much couldn’t give blanket since fever didn’t PPE gear?? made sense.

Cool, mind business. Doesn’t work? problem. make decisions you, I’ll make decisions me. one us thinks authority demand doesn’t do. easy identify masks mandatory.

They would wear mask nose. actually believe one second can, fact, fix stupid? Yes, live never go doctor that. meant vaccinated people felt like pandemic over, masking needed except specific situations, etc.  Forgot /s I’m vaxxed, that’s unrhethorical answer. care whether we're going sick, contagious. Clearly answer yes we're wearing mask even among vaccinated.

The formalities medical definitions let's leave epidemiologists pharma giants. Totally understand! fellow Missourian, wanted share good news seen ;) Also worth noting, CDC really provided data based decision on.

Contract tracing / case studies proven point. Nope. one glad carefully reviewing data following proper processes fully approving vaccine. ensures beyond reasonable doubt vaccines safe effective, institutes trust them. last thing want, especially waning trust government institutions, FDA rush approval vaccines potentially miss something. Even it’s something that’s show stopper like “oh specific group actually shouldn’t get high risk”. way ensure full FDA approval kind meaningful impact done right methodically.

Gofsammfit loves pandemic high death numbers, clearly.  get grateful good odds issue all, sick drag even don’t end hospital. literally removed masks walked capitol immediately Bidens announcement. guys expecting go back office? 1. talking US
2. can't compare hospitalizations semi competent healthcare system people hospitalized. Covid patients watched communitry facilities sent hospital necessary. like 5 deaths covid total. outbreaks proving outbreaks driven vaccinated people possible, therefore increasing chance virus mutates get past vaccine. Hope everyone enjoyed 10 weeks freedom!

This gonna depend live. Many places won’t bring back mandates restrictions matter what. See Texas example. Say sending doses Mexico expire, watch line up... went Alabama confirm one mask, zero social distancing, restaurants looked packed, generally absolutely consideration whatsoever virus. even shields cashier customer. Nothing indicate pandemic. Terrifying. Worse case scenario, could weld doors shut while. company announced today must vaxxed come back early. CEO said every American vaccinated. proud work do. Look numbers hospitalizations deaths. Compare vaccinated vs non vaccinated. Look highest caseloads vs vaccination rates. There’s answer People simply don’t want it. It’s. That. Simple. deflecting question. However, culture well **general public, bit attuned nuance** typical scientist,

This satire, right? brother doctor wife, pharmacist. tried NY saw number people asking getting 5 vaccines one day would make sick. (Because can’t ask ID NY???). Anyway, need way track it, people sign (and get) multiple vaccinations. mean like Trump? Boo fucking hoo. Zero sympathy patience people. so? don’t get argue right choose freedom also argue business doesn’t right make choices behalf (that aren’t discriminatory otherwise corrupt). Free market, don’t want get vaccine work somewhere vaccine isn’t required. Free market settle out. Hint: it’s interests free market everyone vaccinated. offered vaccine everyone, required it. Vaccinated people still catch virus test positive, fairly rare. people testing positive vaccinated, required, morons. Hey [some know stay (relatively) safe still good time. Maybe, faster next variant—that could fuck us Anti-vaxxers collective millstone around neck humanity. randomly disappeared tomorrow, nothing value would lost. didnt get paid. Thsts issue It’s little late pushing mass, full vaccination… damage pretty much done we’ll likely need boosters entirely new vaccine rate things going. full vaccinations help “train” rolling, much harder stop. critical question hospitalized 7 vaccinated? winter local health dept telling us wait 4-5 days possible exposure get tested. changed? surge cases referring that's 'almost bad first wave"" driven unvaccinated people. Breakthrough infections hospitalizations among vaccinated remain low compared overall vaccinated population. numbers looking suggest massive outbreaks among fully vaccinated rival first wave 2020? weird retort. 800 cases, 7 required hospitalization. Keep mind. vaccines still extremely effective serious disease. one rhetorical questions I’ve heard much about?

I’m vaxxed pissed unvaxxed threaten health. Yeah. I’d like 3rd shot. Like right now. prove virus doesn’t mutate vaccinated folks? He's trying hardest real di ck. Exactly *what* demanding everyone vaccinated lunacy? medically unable get mRNA vaccine, J&amp;J covered. absolutely excuse vaccinated. Spanish Flu raging, people wore masks 3 years.

Flu helpful comparison know average person behaves flu season. Normal, healthy people continue daily lives, immune compromised people take extra precautions, young children especially careful. think probably simple stat could look answer question. someone high risk, might even tolerate slightly higher risk since reasonable precautions could take outbreaks protect myself.

While understand rebuttal here, point ""average"" person likely means reasonably protect outbreaks.

I've trying find silver lining clusterfuck that's pretty good one. stupidly interpreted new data shouldve comforted them. data shows vaccine better even thought first, unvaccinated ones need worry. got spooked want protect anti vax idiots even protect themselves.  yea well maybe also god fake. Bad news: even get vaccine chicken pox still get shingles. It’s rather unfortunate thing found couple years ago. Like vaccinated? record Gainesville quite liberal much masked since beginning. Correct, however may implies greater 50%likelihood, wanna call 75%? means they're testing. They've closed testing sites, people interested showing testing eyes gouged out.

So time, shake things little - we've done pandemic thing reverse 2021. opposed 2020 COVID. year, decided let everybody act pandemic (because""tHe vAcCiNeS OuT!!), go ahead let hospitals fill capacity.......and decide may be......

# ......issues. wanna get paid insurance companies. sucks here. family fully vaccinated, rest city probably isn't. least that's feels like. state government really try anything. Back home, slowly recovering. even really mention severe disease part article quick word. 

&amp;#x200B;

What really means anti-vaxxors can't hang hat friends/family getting vacc'd. protect them. here. point human rights trump sort malignant policy? Hollywood taught Americans negotiate terrorists. People chose get vaccinated get back line. research intubate themselves. Ironic thing new mask advice CDC vaccinated people likely follow wear masks unvaccinated people - whole point vaccinated people wear protect unvaccainted - wont protect masks That's exactly point made yesterday's daily thread. anti-vaxxers caused delta... developing world large populations high density unvaccinated people unsanitary conditions.

But hope here. Vaccinated people get breakthrough infections mostly present asymptomatic mild cases (like cold). believe heard somewhere initial evidence indicating immunity due prior infection (rather vaccine) similar boat delta. So... either vaccine infection acquired immunity new strains mild low risk hospitalization death.

At end day, believe covid eradicated. whole population vaccinated exposed, issue? matters rate hospitalization death... subsequent exposure (or vaccine booster) reduces likelihood, eventually new variant covid different strain coronavirus based common cold (for intents purposes). Texan, abhor man. science-denying lowlife. mean, isnt considered dumbest state America nothing Yes, missed point. people vaccinated means less people die short term. However people vaccinated still moving society especially without mask still spreading virus providing opportunities mutate. Eventually enough mutations acquire ability kill effectively evade vaccine. Leading deaths long term. Leading one conclusion regardless vaccination status prevent mutations worse disease people must practice social distancing masking public. feel same. baby right pandemic. everything. Curbside pickup delivery, going out, seeing friends, etc. husband work person. put son daycare, work home baby, mentally broken. I've see therapists. go back work person teach Florida...in 2 weeks. I'm fucked. Finally! state #1 something! must it. 8L/min oxygen lot oxygen. People (except reddit rogan crowd) place much higher value life 16th century expected 10-20% city die smallpox times every decade vaccination card literally bathroom counter got third injection. Living reputation There's oof here. That's Darwinism work, God's good work. Maybe consider editing last post clarify. 
Good reconsidering stance though sure! Yeah we're stuck crazy cycle anti-vaxxers someone family die get seriously ill covid-19. change tune tearful plea others get vaccinated.

And rest anti-vaxxers ignore happens someone family. think difficulties equally split this, also dumb understand community spread works. understand spreads, care understand it, I'm never gonna understand try to. FREEEDOMMM!!! need *extremely* cautious lab data. Remember beginning pandemic lab study claimed live virus detectable surfaces 3 days people starting dousing groceries Lysol? need real-world data, lab studies show something theoretically possible manifest real life. said, fact UK regulatory agency determined vaccines risk children covid

They say exactly, said yet enough evidence show risks Covid outweighs risk vacvines, want data vsccines . exactly right though, relatively close thing. can't help side US doctors experts think vaccinating teens right choice, based evidence I've seen, based benefits teens could getting vaccinated, like missing school, able visit granny without worrying passing covid etc. like medical regulators look weighing risk death serious injury extremely incredibly rare anyway. medical regulators charge transport, theme parks, going beach etc...we would never leave house. LeT BuSiNesSes dEcIdE. Fuck gop That's reality works though, learn go, new data comes up.

It sounds like overloaded news maybe good idea pause treat covid treated 2020. Masks, avoid crowded indoor places vaccinate. give good balance enjoying life protecting yourself.   want advocating action, saying agree people it.

I'm interested untill public health officials say necessary. walked in. said needed 2nd vaccine. asked vaccination card. said it. said could issue another card. said that’s fine. asked still going able get shot. said yes. printed sticker said “put sticker vaccination card get home.”

I waited five minutes. Got third vaccination. Waited 15 minutes allergic reaction. Nothing happened. left. 

My state health department released document earlier week saying would good idea high risk people get third vaccination yet offer sort advice go getting third vaccination document. improvised. Yeah seriously, like that's one biggest biggest determinator. Jesus christ. suprised? No. reasonable path forward would people get vaccinated, clear ever happen. resisted long changing mind.

Anyone wants mitigate what's come already vaccinated, rest ready embrace it, stupid might be. Exactly feeling.  April 7, 2021 -- COVID-19 increases risk developing erectile dysfunction (ED) nearly six times, according data first study investigate association ED COVID-19 young men real-life setting.Apr 7, severe symptoms largest declines. hospitalized put ventilator average drop cognitive scores equivalent 7-point decline IQ, researchers reported.

\--------------------

I honestly thought getting ED would get people asses get vaccine, no. risk cognitive decline end severe case Covid well. Seriously, low end joke R-naught be! Well science suggest transmission amongst vaccinated, hanging word may. Similarly republicans hanging word masks may prevent transmission virus, one shot may protective. flawed logic. Redditors rejoicing! Right? They’re performing efficacy thought would, astronomically high vaccine, suddenly we’re “well guess they’re better nothing”

This sub. insurance companies jack premiums unvaccinated people. Oh no, everyone think policy makers data? Lmao YES! also 3yo 5 yo. Time rip band aid. part! backpedaling insane - risk breakthrough infections low, even spread get sick, it’s mild. Let make risk decisions. 

As stated - usual states immediately happily reimpose mask mandates punish vaccinated. need governors guts finally tell people make personal risk assessments get vaccinated.  I'm starting think FL good job.

🙄 worry.

I'm sure Trump save  Yup, could mean bedridden days really, really sick, quite sick enough require trip hospital. Freaking ""symptoms"" without mention severity symptoms seems like fearmongering. dude really wants Matthew McConaughey take job. does/can make dogs sick actually quite disturbing gave freedom refuse vaccination continue viral

workplaces already mandating vaccine. gave us nothing expect us give right decide medicine. refuse cancer treatment reason anywhere planet body.

you abort baby body

""i dont want get vaccinated""

""NOOOOO BODY ANYMORE""

what kind bullshit this? Pretty plain day. Water wet. It’s endemic always be. Children ages become ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). kids infected typically become sick adults might show symptoms all. 
 children capable getting virus causes COVID-19, become sick often adults. children mild symptoms According American Academy Pediatrics Children's Hospital Association, U.S. children represent 13% COVID-19 cases. Research suggests children younger ages 10 14 less likely become infected virus causes COVID-19 compared people age 20 However, children become severely ill COVID-19. might need hospitalized, treated intensive care unit placed ventilator help breathe, according Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC). 
 
from  Within month, won’t naive hosts left US infect, reached herd immunity combo vaccinated previously infected people. read CDC memo Wapo obtained?

It needs interpretation aren’t antiVax.

This might well new virus. transmits easier common cold contagious chicken pox. Vax protects 40% (Pfizer numbers Israel, giving 60+ 3rd dose booster).

Layer protection would clothes warmth. 

Vax, Mask, Distance, face shield can’t distance.

This won’t stop everyone worldwide vaccinated.

For want return “normal” haven’t shots: blame get shots. 

This pandemic unvaccinated now. According CDC's new guidelines, we're supposed wear mask indoor public places areas ""substantial transmission"" ( they're defining 50 new cases per 100k people 7 days positivity rate 8%). found definitions article: guy really hates Texas huh  Oh sorry. really know rate kids. gather going delta, obviously still relatively low compared adults. I've equally frustrated. ""Follow science!!"" say, science really slow. I'm opting cautious possibly can. Federal worker here. fact wrong. 

You must provide proof vaccination get nasal brain probe every week. Also much paper pushers teleworking don’t even think tests apply come back office. 

An actual shot mandate would run union lawsuits. testing regime opted via vaccination. much lower bar clear legally. 

They counting people tired brain scraped every week. happen cases hard core anti vax people likely keep taking test. think best way use scripture preach them, rather offer perspective Bible taken word big sky man punish them. Using Bible’s values reason stop gives Bible power better so. make change, offer new perspective growth. all, forcing people follow dogma leads deep psychological problems.

Your last point true, can’t make change believe sky god wants, can’t make believe anything. healthiest thing offer new perspective want hear it. elected fully knowing kind things would thought conservatives believe small governments able make educated decisions based happening local area? Isn’t beliefs? Big government stepping telling little guys run counties/cities? talking about? Fresh presses, Texas governor dick Hit gym. Honestly, depending data looking next weeks, I’m leaning towards going it. *think* (and based anecdotal data friends coworkers) shouldn’t flu-ish symptoms go third, simply know people covid got vaccinated, reaction **first** dose, basically nothing second. I’m doctor/immunologist, sounds like immune system “primed” first exposure (either pathogen vaccine), second exposure triggers aggressive immune response; that, immune system “tuned” enough doesn’t affect normal bodily processes noticeably.

[This explained got third shot inquired. agree point. also affecting children young vaccinated. Texas Children’s patients ventilators. also affecting adults truly cannot receive vax, like immunocompromised.

Edit: Misread comment. Completely agree you. hear you. delta ripping communities hard, given places either mandating masks enforcing half-heartedly, pretty much guaranteed us going catch Delta? key stats really many hospitalized people vaccinated?

The message switch ""vaccine shield covid"" ""vaccine prevent hospitalization covid"" (which admittedly already message switch). They're sucking Trump's dick, they're sucking Trump's followers dicks.

They're simping psycho votes. Republicans complain big govt reaching lower govt levels controlling lives stopped non-essential international travel (and required strict 2-week quarantines essential travel) soon knew going become pandemic, become pandemic.

If world implemented strategy point since became pandemic, would stopped spread new regional variants across globe, made less likely variants appear first place (as fewer regions would infected).

This seems completely obvious. Medieval Italians figured - let infected people in, people can't get infected. State capacity control borders increased massively since 1300s. missing something? people stupid? Corrupt? afraid sounding like certain shitty US president? *at least* plan implement strategy case new, potentially deadlier pandemic, see talk nowhere. can't develop vaccine? death rate like untreated bubonic plague? It’s effective *at least* six months. That’s last testing interval done trial subjects. Expect hear longer duration soon. mental health kids already breaking point. don’t mean rude need quiet spouting stuff don’t know 85% symptomatic infection. I've seen numbers 60s infection, recently Singapore.  fucking gimpy piece shit toast, no? thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

reading disheartening comes whole set problems. Don’t forget, people pay system feel entitled say live life. works well coronavirus, well social issues comes politicians like cheap housing Texas doesn’t seem worth it. I’m proud Texan always makes even prouder. Wow. outdid Florida. Quite feat I'd prefer sacrificing kids health get there. vaccines eligible everyone I'm fine letting play out. Long term pain coming keep remotely teaching kids (especially young ones) That’s fair hear that. you’re concerned yeah safest bet playing safe till vaccines available. Hopefully it’s soon idea, irrelevant. Nothing said addresses emerge new dangerous variants. surely know better WHO. Arizona checking in. School started 9 days ago, see results another week so. sickens politicians don’t care health safety children, let alone adults. willingly unvaxxed don’t care. think everyone brainwashed reality ones got brainwashed. Honestly, pull federal funding asshat. I'm sick states relying tax dollars come begging idiotic ""no big gubment"" obstructionism inevitably fucks them. hell would anyone downvote this? I'm huge fan personal space, always been. pandemic Ive forced practically run away people stop getting face. Jaysus people, back off, seriously. Maybe so, might school community specific. daughter friends wearing masks. noticed got together, one girls wearing mask went got mom put on. Kids lot respectful thoughtful give credit for. Yes, data complex unfortunately anti-vaxx crowd using benefit. working, people take time understand nuance. 

Data Israel, ahead world vaccination used Pfizer, shows exactly saying - immunity getting covid waning, protection serious disease death still high. also shows we'll need booster sure. 

I looking sources keep date mess found John Campbell's YouTube channel. He's retired medical professional living UK goes latest data research world. mostly pretty good job putting together perspective. data shows vaccine better even thought first

Can tell part encouraging you? I'd love good news today thanks. 175,000 people died?? (Honest question, European) Ofc we’ll living Covid rest lives like 99% diseases exist, normalcy I’m talking one restrictions - masks, social distancing, testing unless sparse localized outbreaks possible vaccinate enough people. know “they” are, Unvaccinated straight refuse get vaccinated I’ll exempt group actually can’t take vaccine medical reasons aren’t eligible yet potentially completely unable vaccinated (which happened areas), actually need high vaccination rates achieve herd immunity protect people idiots can’t basic responsibility getting vaccinated protect communities, much less themselves. Texas biggest turd country. So, dumb ones?
Got it! vaccinated year ago, ending hospital. recall, prevalent wisdom young, healthy people would end bad cold. That's clearly longer case. one ways make sense UK trends. sub complaining mask mandates, safety measures (granted, warranted show w/ little use) since like January year dude. sub took distinct shift tone since winter. 

It recently, due anti-vax idiots causing recent surges, complainers bite tongue can't like ""SO tRuSt SCIencE"" like y'all months ago lol. probably somewhere around 65%

Where get number from? prob around 85% Thank breaking me. appreciate it! Yes, article said 97% unvaccinated average age 55years old admitted hospitals. Even Alabama, people age 65 vaccinated. Teachers. group care even less about. allowed refuse service? man dead set spreading COVID much possible. Probably try convert wards reality triage happen. Get bad car wreck…well bad. Symptomatic mean lot things. Stuffy nose, scratchy throat, tired, etc. agree point, keep mind. Conservatives determined kill voters. It’s unreal. I'd argue less comes holidays events are. Holidays = households mixing average day week countries. Families friends get together. case, please accept humble apologies congratulations awesome person. hope kids happy lives get love opportunities every child get. I'm fully vaxxed attending conventions next month labor day weekend. likely fine. Wear mask inside crowded areas fun!  supposed get yet Same. 🤜🤛 amazing many people seem actively side plague Drive progressives corporations state.

Blue districs suffer.

State never turns blue. 

More money shady politics corporations would bring in.   Let free market dictate pandemic safety! Thanks feedback! guess beginning 10% hospitalized vaccinated would consider ""alarming"" amount since expected vaccinated get hospitalized all. people get vaccinated goal post might change. Someone needs wheel guy cliff, love Texas people like make hard. Maybe read article next time jumping strawman want clarify something. mean cloth mask like made breathable fabric like cotton? Bandannas, etc? simple mask, like medical/surgical mask? Sorry, bad example.

You bring really good points, first occupation popped head. believe end lot earlier though end fewer total school days, could wrong, ages since cared look lol. age statistics hospitalized please? I'm literally gay Imagine happens next pandemic moves through. one 5% fatality rate children. going effective. need mask mandate everyone comes building, matter Third shot boosters currently study. rate voting bloc dead. leaked memo? Oh well... learning here? 

When choose leader based much rights take away others different expect leader turn around care you, end looking stupid dead. reality. prime example chickens coming home roost. believe happened 1890s ""flu"" may coroanavirus. know ironic? 

As Texas becomes purple, side votes red party line keeps listening ones spouting hypocritical nonsense cheering things like this..

Sad reality begin set lose lives something could vaccinated also (seemingly) make voting population would vote keep him. 

Harris/Dallas/Travis counties 50%+ rate versus larger populated counties sometimes going prime political science statistical data crunching material years come. got wrong, honest question. federal government issue executive order overrule? Source purely anecdotal. I've seen mentioned several articles, virtually always quote ICU doctor. 

You're welcome find ways disbelieve dismiss it, course. think many people would comfortable continuing think Covid something affect youth lack pre-existing conditions. There's talk-radio guy Nashville cited factors reasons worried Covid getting vaxxed. Yesterday put ventilator. Question: turn long term negative effects vaccine insisted given people will, would personally admit wrong? would stand actions say still risk worth taking greater good? trying pin mindset. need vaccine mandate, mask mandate. genius sure vaccine focus? “We” mitigate it? we? I’m gonna pay read I’m depending give complete interpretation. Thank you! big herd immunity experiment underway. Also, see people fully vaccinated hospitalized due covid, all, ever, state Illinois. knowledge, total hospitalizations tracked. 


There 6 million Illinoisans fully vaccinated. vaccination rate Massachusetts means little here. matters vaccination rate among group exposed Provincetown. exact number unknown (and unknowable - can't check exposed infected), likely high, well 70%. 70%, 75% vaccination rate among infected would mean vaccines make *more* likely infected!

Put another way, imagine 10,000 people Provincetown. 95% vaccinated. 1000 people catch covid, 75% vaccinated. good bad news vaccines? Well, among 500 unvaccinated people, 250 caught covid, 50%. among 9,500 vaccinated, 750 caught covid, 8%! pretty good result! kids supposed start 3 weeks. Wife agonizing quitting job, taking kids out, trying make (financially) 12 vaccines available keeping hoping best. worst part worked ass last 4 years get position now. Currently working youngest kid's school, was/is perfect fit her. Anyway, hoping governor backtrack holding breath. International. Teachers TX literally cannot strike sorry. can’t imagine...purely evil anti-maskers anti-vaxxers doing. can’t think explanation evil blatantly selfish. parent older children heart breaks you, would feel exact way.  Well, Facebook boomer’s social media now!  Singapore quarantine everyone coming weeks hotels? sounds like reason cases rather simply wearing masks. Well, Facebook boomer’s social media now! Omfg, let’s Texas anti-vaxxers/markers perish! Enough them.  mean I’ll honest, unreduced spread despite vaccination well seeming leveling 6 months pretty close worst case scenario, assuming live vaccine world  Wow, requiring tests everyone unvaccinated.

And sitting quarantine UK fully BioNTech vaccinated european coming Germany lower cases UK... state government keeps stopping Biden put wall around Texas. I’m pro-vax double shot, I’m gonna willy nilly get shots hoping works better reason don’t take 5 label says “take 1 bedtime.” Right parents keep loosing god damn minds even kids don’t care masks Yeah. Still, shall celebrate every vaccination. Anything cling good news, rest area around continues bury heads sand. goal kill constituency? ""probably"", literally heard argument gun nuts before. Sounds like may work office. results idiots getting killed less GOP voters, Darwinism wins Well see haven’t pandemic ones exactly. like I’ve said earlier push vaccines must continue protect vulnerable limit spread, vaccinated part problem whether admit hindering path normalcy. Look Olympics. Basically every nation ""fuck it"" point except North Korea, refused go. There's bunch security theater nobody seems take seriously. It’s great news. wished knew *why* happening. Smoke test find mayors follow not? *wheelchair* Hospital Worker SE Alabama here. inpatient numbers went 28 July 21 71 today (July 30). spread vicious. Conservatism avarice death called Hook would like word.

What one every day?

Nope, still change majority minds. part Alabama?

My neck woods still barriers everywhere, lots masks, etc.

If rural location, may seeing things always were: unchanged wearing seatbelts. Simple: refusing cancer treatment allow cancer spread others.

Aborting baby cause abortions.

When u refuse vaccination, u allow virus spread freely. spreads, easier mutate. could come day vaccination enough Covid resists vaccines.

A better example smoking. stop smoking? body.

Except smoke gives someone else Cancer. what? F#ck near u? I’d hoped brain worked better legs, guess not. Yes right…..why try keep kids safe? it, friend. might notice much changed outside gilded cage. want believe you’re right everyone telling crazy last Feb disease are. I’m cautiously pessimistic point. think people HIV allowed sex whoever, tell them, intentionally spread it? body choice afterall. Yeah ever gay beach town they're events, know much closer contact is. study worry I'm going events like that. went Hershey Park got fast pass even stand line people. I'm vaccinated, engage risky events, feel perfectly safe. 346 break cases study, 127 fully vaccinated 84 unvaccinated similar viral loads. equate unvaccinated vaccinated spread same. 

""This intriguing data, important, I'm positive equally infectious vaccinated"" Dr. Monica Gandhi infectious disease specialist University California. 

Can dig little deeper get studies data declare fact? Israel situation vaccine breakthroughs initially reported somewhere around 40 people something. wow. I'm opinion much deadly/contagious variant eventually emerge point, course idiots forced reverse course inane laws arguments. changing delta. number bad outcomes pediatric cases rising consensus seems developing something different  Reactionary regressives noted foresight. California trailing behind them. Oregon pretty big upswing well. Apparently mysterious unknown disease killed hundreds thousands definitely one know about. seem forgetting initially idea vaccines would cut transmission all.

Then CDC advised vaccinated need wear masks? party climate change antivax etc. 🤪🤪🤪 346 vaccinated that's like 1% people hospitalized You’re correct, fact two hive minds dueling control. Nah, we'll never stand that, even us diligent precautions first year this. something we're gonna live with. vaccines dramatically reduce likelihood severe disease/hospitalization/death, making still threat longer orders magnitude dangerous threats already face day day. can't wait booster specifically designed go Delta. Funny make point. Open carry legal Sept 1 Texas.  Anti-vaxxers defined ""people gotten COVID shot.""

You'd get lot people getting shot. I'm struggling find polling data saw number, significant portion population ""if to"" camp. anecdotal info backs up.

There's another group worried missing work inability care kids due side effects.

Those two groups see 100% uptake locked up.

I think smokers unvaxxed people would high rates. think time society stop viewing every death highly contagious respiratory disease entirely preventable. ignores human nature, that's evidence-based decision making. CDC still says Agreed. Tree failed us. Killing supporters winning strategy. override federal law allows businesses institutions make decision btw. (not articles).

I believe there's reason that.

There articles aliens outside house right either. reason. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's uninsured, come get tested. ""Hey, man, move Austin. great. like shitty parts Texas.""

""Nah, I'm good.""

""But...why?"" Since contact-traced outbreak it’s fairly unlikely people wouldn’t get tested weren’t immediately presenting symptoms.

Furthermore, even case, it’s even worse news degree asymptomatic spread infection occurs vaccinated people. amazing fast politicians move pass laws culture war topics like masks takes years pass common sense laws reforms. really hope Matthew Mconaughey runs governor kicks Governor Abbutt office 

I know people don’t want celebrities office closest person beat according polls uploaded fivethirtyeight Texas robust self-defence laws. allowed act self-defence stop mass loss life harm? still wear t-shit shoes go mall, right? 1 million/day, 7 day rolling average deaths 300. Even triple deaths 900/day, cfr &lt;0.1%.   though vaccine free, adverse reaction complication requires emergency hospital visit could cause financial ruin low income worker even insurance.

I bet hospital visit vaccine free paid for, still would take vaccine considering hospitalization Covid would cost much. small correction - according latest official numbers able find, primarily killing unvaccinated. Delta variant killing nearly identical number vaccinated unvaccinated (latest reported vaccinated deaths, 2 - insignificant. mostly shows people pre-disposed incredibly susceptible matter what) developed countries.  


HOWEVER, diminish point - hospitalizations roof unvaccinated individuals. We're fortunate medical capacity keep death count low. one hand Dutch government says “from two weeks injection protected corona virus.”

And spokesperson ministry health told NOS “immediately vaccination well-protected think responsible let in.”

That's idiotic ... know Texas several times hinted seceding Union, Abbott realize six foot holes constituents buried surround U.S. soil? Death escape seems think is. GOP others done huge disservice US. 

It effecting ever younger people. day, CNN interview fully vaccinated mother, gave Covid unvaccinated 15 year old daughter, ventilated, induced coma.

Wear masks thing settles down…hopefully next year least children fully vaccinated. Even difficult, school district services Ft. Hood Killeen ISD. KISD 12 campuses Ft. Hood. employees military bases required wear masks. People schools also required wear masks. So, portion district required wear masks, however rest district prevented requiring masks. smokers lung cancer? overdoses alcohol poisoning? Heart complications severely obese people? Internal bleeding people wear seatbelts? Broken bones skateboarders? People incurable diseases?

How much information need gather make prioritization makes calls? That's anything beyond emergencies non-emergencies would endless nightmare. Can’t say states, basing daughter start kindergarten: there’s MMR (measles/mumps/rubella), hepatitis B, DTaP Tdap (diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis), chickenpox, polio. Older kids need another Tdap meningitis vaccine.

This 100%, without shadow doubt people pushing bullshit political agenda. pretty much guarantee overwhelming majority COVID anti-vaxxers vaccinated kids already, likely multiple times. home school able get it.

Note: account batshit crazy states allow religious exemptions vaccines, religion aware (save, perhaps, Christian Science?) doctrinal mandate vaccination. religious figures peddle anti-vaxx bullshit, based scripture, dogma, otherwise “true” teaching religion, recognized religious body.  hate say it, CDC basically become joke point. Scott sort throwing bus week (but nice way). 

It's shame since CDC always seemed great movies. Overturning won’t change much state full people would rather catch covid get vaccinated. Hutchinson’s town hall today shit show. Ongoing fight. March:

“Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) filed lawsuit city Austin keeping local order requiring use face masks Gov. Greg Abbott (R) eliminated state-wide mask mandate.

The lawsuit filed Austin Mayor Steve Adler (D), Travis County Judge Andy Brown Mark Escott, interim Medical Director Health Authority Austin, CNN reported.

""I told Travis County &amp; City Austin comply state mask law. blew off. So, again, I'm dragging court,"" Paxton tweeted.

Abbott announced March 2 would lift Texas' mask mandate coronavirus restrictions, though Austin officials signaled week would push keep mask mandate .15% CFR UK. Pretty positive CFR perspective. grand scheme things, no. statistically insignificant. heart attack deaths time span 1,411 compared previous years even blip radar.

It's terrible families 1,411 people, especially right thing got vaccinated. sometimes number called. Yes difference 90% UK's 50's least one shot. huge populations vulnerable people who've none. real answer know. 

Delta became main strain US weeks ago, take multiple life cycles infection (each around 2 weeks) figure impacts people without breakthroughs.  I’m certain statistical anomaly conversation give much peace family give ok turn life support afternoon…I’ll let know nurse practitioner wife said let know that…We 45 people ICU right vaccinated literally dying anomaly. I’ll let families know great piece information well.
My lunch break over….gotta go give people amazing knowledge good news not. Even though current vaccines shown decreased efficacy Delta, actual protection still staggeringly high, better every flu shot ever developed, still among best vaccines ever. people get jab, protected entire world population becomes. I'm saying experiment drugs. sketchy hell. proper studies done. 

It's urgent done right now. Even best thing get third shot, always wait period vaccines. Like think reason delta spreading faster Israel relatively short periods vaccinations, compared UK lot longer.

There one study found Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine 81% effective second dose given three months first, 55% efficacy six weeks.

If look like TBE vaccine second dose taken 1-3 months first, third dose 5-12 months second, take booster doses every 3 years. would time get third dose, they'll probably know people not. wish jackass would stop telling communities operate. Texas great state generally lets municipalities govern themselves, like small government, republican party should.  works Midland doesn’t fucking work Houston vice versa. Stop forcing political priorities communities don’t want them. GTFO false “small government” ideals. I’m fed Abbott show boat republican cronies. They’re Republican Name true republicans would stay fucking business. drives crazy. 

Is gonna prevent schools requiring meningitis tetanus vaccine next? dumb enough see shit think “he’s Lord’s work here”? I’ll give hint - it’s ones don’t get educated well enough Republican Party dismantling school system years. Keep populace dumb don’t know better. mention republican governor Alabama crying saying pandemic nonvax folks pretty damning.. wish Desantis learn I’m thinking ultimately work betterment humanity.  matter time new variant pop cause even deafness also blindness. Damn 2020 fuxking amazing. love watching dumbasses prove right Except seemingly starting see rise, again. living fear right now. husband fully vaxxed live Houston area. pandemic hit, husband quit job (I higher wage earner best option) massively changed lifestyle could afford keep kids school virtually. essentially stayed inside home last 16 months main one go necessary. far, 4 us managed become infected. option taken away district offering virtual year, can’t afford stay one income much longer.

Our daughter 8 son, severe autism non-verbal, 4. start school August 11…without mask mandate place. fairly confident daughter keep mask throughout school day, never able get son wear mask. 

Hey Governor Abbott, please give advice explain “personal responsibility” son wear mask school around dozens unmasked, unvaccinated students adults? desperate signed kids pediatric vaccine trials, far neither selected. terrified don’t know do. actual nightmare. that, kids, Texas turned blue. heard sentiment ""We gotta something keep Californians moving here."" lot rural areas. Man, can't catch break. Delta variant worse thought, see many businesses governments requiring vaccines masks, bringing back social distancing next logical step. “Me, me, me”

Unfortunately, aren’t realizing live society. civilization. One depends interdependence, alive today benefiting fact people stopped worrying things common good. 

You don’t live island. Man up. I've said before, I'm beginning think collective hive mind humanity suicidal.

I wonder there's link fact we've killed planet deep level way too. Southeast states thump chest strong local government big brother would get backs let govern themselves…. hypocrisy never ends assholes Oh understand that, that. clearer, hoping info full hospital is. PA, online. 

I'm also trying find specific location Florida, too. Trying help family hospital.

Very good advice course! Yeah one family member contact point info goes (large) family there. Unfortunately first rodeo it, Uncle passed back December COVID. thing seems missing many people contacted many responded.

Let's say contacted 10,000 vaccinated people 500 unvaccinated people, 300 unvaccinated people responded 9,000 vaccinated people did. Finding case numbers terribly concerning then. obviously made numbers, zero idea real ones are, fact appears missing makes almost meaningless. mean it’s internet. People biased. lot people want hear vaccines work free. psychos think world ending. much noise is, it’s easy make case one way another. Especially since science necessity lags behind reality We’re going moon! Oh... leave word, ""we"" fuck mouth, loser.  amount properly fitted masks truly helping people public probably single digits %. That's always confuses people demanding masks lower age groups too. kids wear nylon mask target paw patrol it. people really think going stop much anything? might help stop cough sneeze getting droplets everywhere way many gaps stop something airborne. mental wreck all. Worst 4 years life terms politics. know presidents plenty bad stuff keeping spotlight negative way every damn day. Also, I'm keen seeing flawed government structure preventing dictatorship coup often feeling like verge that. awful government like need best try prevent authoritarian type people top seats power easy fix flaws. Give third shot right meowwww deaths? Sounds good me. see event like large gatherings gay party town means need wear mask go buy potatoes. Know risks make judgment calls, I'm sure lot guys prep too. We’re sick dumb conservatives making worse.  blue town residents probably smart enough still mask even though vaccinated

Nope, sadly Austin, aren't. Observations last week 10% people wearing mask indoors.

I've vaccinated since June always wear mask go out, get car. Sure. possible unaware spreader before, asymptomatic infection, mask mandates social distancing decreased chance spreading virus unknowingly.

Now, Delta variant, see lot breakthrough infections, mostly cause asymptomatic minor infections fully vaccinated people. Vaccinated people tend feel less risk also less risk others participate public life events without masks social distancing. lead vaccinated people breakthrough infections spreading Delta variant vaccinated people and, worse, unvaccinated people, Delta especially harmful. CDC figures rest world known 3 months story question? Seems like distraction. 5% long covid 20s...and assumes get infected once. Plenty young people perfect health get long covid. 

I driven beltway years assure orders magnitude safer risk getting long covid.

Your odds ""ridiculously fucking low."" either can't math, making emotional decision bury head sand that's feels good you. moral tale that, yes, people would rather die unnecessarily give believe liberties. 

And is, generally, one best traits humanity. harder part finding worthwhile things believe in. fuck Exactly, op saying going use guide foe mask. Don’t worry, won’t slow motion long. sMaLL goVErnMeNt!!! Yeah...not rude orginal commenter can't imagine kids fun like wanting show up. would normally since vaccinated cancel. bordering insanity. you’re going treat like it’s March 2020 wouldn’t it. Dang well bad news. Thank response. talking I'm sure allies talking I'm trying win any. can't imagine think I'd want allies for. “Anyone defiling disease must wear torn clothes, let hair unkempt, cover lower part face""-Leviticus 13:45 

It's right there! Even God wants wear mask people aren’t pro life. anti abortion cases go up, he'll blame immigrants, like months ago. super annoying cause associates got vaxxed back wearing masks correctly unvaccinated people stopped wearing wearing around chins again, it’s essentially useless. Especially since customers aren’t required to. Except got rich payout got injury paralyzed him. Later would make sure nobody else could get payout like did. 

He’s absolutely welfare baby. No, stop letting anyone make fucking choice, fucking stupid. Start putting people fucking jail, including Governors. shit litteraly first degree murder point. also accept still risk regardless mitigation. Yes. else would this? would overwrite cities?  work well greatly reducing odds death hospitalization Israel UK, despite hit hard delta variant, hospitalization death number way anywhere near previous peaks last year. UK expected hit least 100,000 cases day, maybe double that, instead hit 55,000 dropping precipitously past week. Israel, hospitalizations small fraction saw last year.  


I see need alarm vaccines work damn well. I've infected, I'm fully vaccinated, I'm scared. Going go live best life wish everyone else suspend non-essential travel business Texas? Seems like want ""woke""  comment removed Auto mod, sure why. 

Basically see point. Fuck greg Abbott grooving big reason many young adults opted jab. **Since requires one-shot fully vaccinated time.** Dutch health minister Hugo de Jonge tweeted good news earlier  Fuck point im vaxed wear mask. Im enjoying new jobs opening up. Another year 2 like ""old days"" boomers talk about. Walk store immediately hired least interviewed. ability single person provide whole family. took boomers kill refusing wear fucking mask. 

Bring on. someone simply answer right this? can’t figure all. Delta's motto, ""Keep Climbing""


...oh wait Delta airlines? Kids district year great them. Thank editing Alabama. governor mostly stuck CDC guidelines. hope that, spending time unvaccinated, virus ""learn"" infect vaccinated much ease (or more, somehow).

Damn it, booster shots, below-12-years-old authorizations coming? Quick: everyone downvote person's 100% factual statement! make *not true* that!

What desperate pathetic bunch. Oh is....... would require parents common sense give info. sisters school district said anyone household waiting test results kid go school. course there’s way enforce it. least two kids per week pulled class “Mom/dad/sis/gma got positive test Bobby Sue go virtual” afraid sister teacher even though she’s vaccinated. Biden charge treason. Let’s start conspiracy theory like Abbott working Russia kill republicans covid. Whatever takes get vaccines people’s arms. Oh yeah, definitely get that. 
I wonder getting third today could help push protection higher. 
Diminishing returns apply course. wear seat belt? Wash hands public? Drive correct side road speed? Yet somehow vast majority vaccinated positive cases outbreak symptomatic. That's exactly happened, though. Herd immunity varies depending behaviors, immunity level, contagiousness virus question. [This described really well. massive portion population fall category terms risk, matter? astronomical number people much risk long term damage disability due age and/or medical conditions? people deserve considered protected, no? They're outliers. I'm worried kids.

I know ""WON'T SOMEBODY THINK CHILDREN!!!"" meme, still.  encourage unplug unsubscribe 🙏  Difference human behavior must part well.

People less exposure due work school. People higher lower risk tolerance. Curious- region school in? northeast college hasn’t submitted guidelines mandating students vaccinated. help god require masks well.. encourage unplug unsubscribe 🙏  not. There's semi-random sampling.


That's problem. could random sampling could tell within 10 100 infections per day what's going million day tests. we'd solid IFR could much higher quality sera testing. 100% convinced tree fell paralyzed waist down, also paralyzed peepee. 'man' manhood. Turtle come shell decades. Get fucked, Texas government. happen vacuum. virus allowed spread unvaccinated unmasked population, increases chances virus mutating.

Which exactly happened. Multiple times. 

There's real chance virus could mutate point current vaccine ineffective. American socially distanced, stayed home year+, happily wears mask got vaccine soon could, let first tell average American spoiled, entitled, social-media addicted idiot listens facebook posts science day week. 99% family included. *Especially* area live in, called ""the bible belt"" try dismiss Israeli data keep saying UK Canada proven otherwise. 

The UK Canada data generally referring people immunocompromised.  There’s evidence vaccines presented though, look figures. quote cuff title suggests evidence. tougher answer people going face that's natural immunity.

If fully vaccinated healthy, getting asymptomatic case Delta may actually bad thing. Good chance boosts immune system next variant come out. third doses different identical first two?   course, purposely exposing oneself bad idea

You say 'of course', [some idiots still things like chickenpox despite vaccine knows! People dumb. Right... numbers massively inflated. played. deadly flu, one panics over. Take damn mask stop whatever government tells do. Unless actually like controlled ""big brother"". state would sue cities/counties threaten/withhold school's funding. executive order can't require patients wear masks.

False--the EO prevents CITY mandates. practice/building/business, require masks. 

Your business, rules. going masks social distancing forever then? confused. baby steps, friend -- gotta start baby steps  O:-) Lol.  You’re serious?   Greg Abbott belongs one prisons. ""What least helpful thing right now?""-Greg Abbott  would masks aren’t mandated Yep. DeSantis same. I'm “War changed.

We tied people ways can't ignore. like is. Big city hospitals serve rural areas surrounding don’t hospitals. can't. legislature banned mandate. Philadelphia confront riders without masks. drivers often unmasked. Here's point: offers one great deal protection serious illness and/or death. 100% protection, vaccine history offered 100% protection.

It literally matter unvaxxed anyone says does; they're getting it. means either compel excluding unvaxxed people society, force via mandate, let 'em get sick die. I'm good options. R8 = doomsday Yes, Abbott face state sanctioned capital punishment... never will. He'll continue roll around like stupid fuckface is. Look comment I’ve posted before. lost Mom (70) brother (41) COVID.  brother underlying issues regardless vaccine available died. got vaccinated first day could. 

I lived shitty COVID person people don’t see. sister right me. still believes vaccine conspiracy. 

Well guess what… whole family picked COVID pretty bad month ago. bet delta variant. Regardless rough go it. asked wished gotten vaccine said way. 

It opinion see two family members die see silence facts yet still believe cracked bullshit Internet human piece shit. limited government compensated government influence banning abortions. Trump states? That’s scary considering change ingesting ecoli. maybe, maybe, worded poorly it’s everyone else problem  Missouri governor, spending pandemic saying it’s county health departments determine county’s requirements (masks, shutdowns, etc.) last month signed legislation limiting health department’s ability impose requirements something like 4 weeks 6-month time frame. Mask mandates never lifted. Masks reinstated countries reported delta spreading among vaccinated. Biden told Americans removed masks vaccinated. 40% even vaccinated. idiotic southern governors banning masks. 

This depressing. wish born country taking seriously. Alabama's motto be: ""Someone last"".  Links helpful correct someone's interpretation. always hypothesized homosexuality Nature's way keeping population growth check. think current Republican mindset way keeping population growth check. feel bad collateral damage. De-Nile Texas. excellent catch. hellrazer24’s point, it’s difficult interpret number without data unvaccinated. Oh, definitely got shot. Probably one first people get Texas, too. according internal CDC report leaked Washington Post today. bit balancing act likely occurring behind scenes. Facebook clamps tightly way that’s obviously, risk pushing people decentralized social media platforms (the types sites known extremism, terrorism, illicit activity), legitimately impossible regulate moderate all. 

All things considered, unless feel like giving government power (attempt) ban people internet, letting Facebook likely lesser evil. feel sick kids. get want keep safe, studies shown COVID isn’t dangerous kids influenza. You’re taking important moments childhood away tiny change Covid hurts them? fully vaccinated (and 65 immuno-compromised) normal already here. Clear cookies refresh.


Works almost every site limits many articles read. even work logistically? Tokyo requiring incoming athletes quarantine 14 days? he's asymptomatic carrier infects bunch olympians? Goddam GOP wants destroy America. start fucking something!

You want work government? need vaccine

You want go school university? need vaccine

You want leave house purpose going grocery drug store? need vaccine confirm, Texan.

Same exact thing happened family friend. caught covid wearing mask ""I CAN'T TAKE MORE"" attitude. Spread whole family. got little... continue talk shit COVID.

My buddy long-term effects far too... depression brain fog. go get SSRI manage level depression experiencing.

Out stores, see 5 - 10% people wearing mask, even.

If go place different types people like Asian grocery market (where 95% people first gen korea, japan, china, etc), 98% people wearing masks. majority Texans brainwashed gimp fuckhead red goons. Hoping start making vaccine mandatory go cafes, bowling alleys, anything recreational. Well, cousin vaccinated get enough load get sick all, might've ER all.

Your cousin change heart getting vaccinated since got sick? New Zealand still 0  Serious question, Gov. Abbott mission kill many people possible? Texans? personal prediction: Pfizer applies EUA booster August gets approved, however recommended healthcare frontline workers, immunocompromised, people 65 older, anyone got second dose January February citing waning immunity. 

So dose schedule would look like this: 1st dose 2nd dose 21 days 3rd dose 6 months after. It’s level “a bad flu season” children 12

Sure. children recover fine. continue spread virus. Spreadneck new favorite word. truly get people subreddit dead-set minimum wage workers enforce policy. Back day would get downvoted hell bringing downside mandates. like people forgot people trying enforce mandates.  right! remember ""urging"" take mask off. like, ""well vaccinated, here's freedom unvaccinated see rewarded are."" 


Everyone vaccinated knows anti-vaxers nervously thinking:



""Do know people, wear masks anyway, incentive. sure telling us unmask right now, like minute, watching Delta variant come India weeks hits us think good idea.""

And funny/sad CDC director announced vaccinated people could take masks off, see much trepidation has, like messenger decided meeting go this, actually thought, ""This get people vaccinated, let see free unvaccinated are.""


Every average person America eyeing anti-vax family like, ""I think incentive CDC thinks is.""  love dying Texas. Amazing choose actively kill people.   missed every single headline saying well vaccine still works Delta? Breakthrough cases happen serve illness insanely rare. Cool jets 3 million people die India? Even Fort Worth (R mayor) mask mandate.

My area pretty Republican still see lot masks. Probably educated people dumb hicks. obviously correct way think it. similar consideration end. comfortable covid patients bump patients hospitals similarly comfortable vaccinating unwilling perhaps confining homes get chance fill hospitals everyone rely on. You’re reading wrong stuff then. Thank you! experience severe case. permanent nerve damage entire right leg, starting base spine. days can’t walk improve spinal implant. Doctors don’t know activated, healthy. It’s wild experience makes look COVID potential long term complications seriously. Oklahoma Florida Great Plains. pretty high...~65% least 1 dose ~55% fully vaccinated.  care children dying school shootings, children abandoned foster system, children living hunger, expect they'll care children dying covid.

That said, offer traditional thoughts prayers proven effective, course. /s 3 days decreasing week week numbers. Thats important metric. cant compare day day  Yeah stay home I’d lose business completely. Even government support Right, else gonna get body count up? trying kill many people possible, gotta team effort. That's India supposedly got 3 million deaths response Gov Hutchinson signed law ban mask requirements. cannot legally require masks anywhere state... sound closely related vaccinated/anti-mask crowd that’s also cool keeping pandemic alive  Party small government! people, keep parroting point making, seem understand GLOBAL pandemic. NEVER able vaccinate 100% 7Billion people. always ""unvaccinated"" people virus mutate always make way back US world interconnected. 

The whole blaming mutations unvaccinated population stupid. blame increased stress hospital systems ones causing mutation. Especially learned vaccinated individuals spread virus, means mutate within vaccinated individuals well... 

The thing is, despite increase virus cases seen increase deaths yet similar early COVID. means vaccines working stopping severe infection people want get vaccine, let play Russian Roulette lives. Agreed. I’m fully faxed getting downvoted saying thing.

People emotional right get it. tired.  Congratulations idiot governor, Texas! Oops, correct. actually makes feel little better. Exactly- boy fucking hate hammer point. 🇨🇦 many people kill? great king. WTF? Governor Hot Wheels strikes again! UK also 4th July Theme Parks operating full capacity. central Florida parks UNREAL terms attendance, that's 3 major parks Provincetown big gaycation spot.  like CAT 5 hurricane entering shoreline say vaccination makes less likely you’ll catch Covid-19 first place – do, data suggests could similar tendency spread unvaccinated folks.   prove hospitals run primarily unvaccinated children would change mind. understanding, risk high. Ever ProvinceTown? Lots lots gay men. Great time though pandemic. problem :) Even don’t believe corona virus masks Texan doesn’t feel like guys mission make dumber kill you? asking…  want get job? think right

You want continue education? say right

You want live life enjoy human experience way aside surviving? say right

This dangerous bullshit way thinking. saying people shouldn’t get vaccine should, that’s road go down. won’t stop there. never time history government given back power granted crisis situations. math example base rate fallacy? Covid mostly spreads presymptomatic, it’ll really hard know mask NP. fuck. Looks like prediction came best personally, point, regarding pandemic believe try convince vaccine god trying help dont ability test method family non-religious live/work one non religious areas industry... 

So far effective method ive seen withhold grandchildren in-person meeting them. negligence, criminal homicide. start talking crimes humanity? USING GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY LIMIT LOWER GOVERNMENTS LIMITING GOVERNMENT. MAKING SURE *HIS* OFFICE CHARGE FACT EMBOLDENING GOVERNMENT. Republicans would tell us big government stay local politics local governments know what's best local communities?

""so think schools mandate something people normally allowed decide themself""

its protecting rights small americans get vaccinated. wheter like ethical choice. refuse cancer treatment body. state full protective macho men, sure OK letting family get sick die. Wheres strength bully disease? think fact seemed middle states Covid peaked last year decided everything right. think luck. purchased $20 glass perfectly regular rose Broadway. must make fucking bank.  Angry member republic? Sounds right, pretty sure US monarchy. Gov Hutchinson signed law. like put hand stove told hot upset someone else. level ignorance knows bounds. Right. COVID masks *inconvenient* one wear save lives.

-Governor Abbott, actually get checked arguing relevant LADPH measuring it. idiot? wish case. know many people completely deny effectiveness masks. It’s infuriating.  fucking stupid. want open economy refuse easiest thing help happen. Didn’t Texas already school person last year?

It option. governor banned online public school back though school districts planning offer cancel plans. Right age sit pubs day, point lockdown surge numbers still went down.  Thank you! also, shit. whole concept limited government supposed tied individual sovereignty. people power, local government, state, federal. That's Constitution lays limited power fed delegates rest states. Power supposed flow bottom pyramid, top. Give years he’ll able read Abbott wants Texans die economy. people likely die covid already vaccinated

There regional aspect this, using national statistic applying regional situation allows large margin error areas surge occurring, states like Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas Louisiana also 10 point drop average first dose vaccination rates among 65+. also increased risk younger cohorts comorbidities, predominantly hypertension, diabetes chronic renal disease. look states highest occurrence comorbidities, find top: Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas Louisiana. say things like 80% Seniors, need keep mind US large, 99% Seniors places like Vermont, Pennsylvania Hawaii pulling statistic way up, people pulling average people currently areas outbreaks occurring. Yeah think used low everything changed delta. like play rules anymore know expect. needed again. That’s new guidance Exactly. 

Gov: ""We've gotta open businesses!!"" 

Business owners: ""Ok, we're going employees customers wear masks keep everyone safe."" 

Gov: ""No! like that!!""   Biden needs get ass issue nationwide vaccine mandate. refusal tell states go shove regards pro-COVID policies biggest disappointment presidency far. quite. mean. Say 75 people vacvinated 25 unvaccinated 100 people. 

Say 20 test positive, 15 vaccinated 5 unvaccinated. 

But 1 15 vaccinated gets hospitalized/dies vs 3 5 unvaccinated group, show vaccines work. data need. guess Texas bought season pass COVID game want timer run switch different game altogether.

""The governor added vaccines remain effective defense virus would never forced state.""

So breath ""No mask mandates vaccine mandates"", said this. medical advice. 


There need one person elected family communication hospital. multiple family members calling patient stressful efficient. Family need get list questions phone call. One person calls gets answers disperses info everyone else.  Gay cakes make absolute nonsense. deny service everyone wearing mask ""personal belief."" High profile stories young people partying reflect collective reality. median age UK 40.  think part fear children whole “long Covid” thing don’t know long term complications, lots “long term” left lives. people refusing vaccines inner city minorities working?

now lets loot countless studies show lockdowns dont work.....

yeah disagree media dont want talk anymore... strange isnt it? Ending pandemic 6 months would let affected companies return profitablity much sooner. Even greedy got screwed this. cold? Power loss. hot? Power loss. Hard rain? Power loss. 

We literally lose power anytime weather anything decent. fucking infuriating, especially working home. kids needed show full vaccination record go day camp years. people been? People US fucked, jfc best friend MD works veterans hospital spinal cord injury patients. lot people permanent serious health issues, cannot vaccinated. taught pharmacists grad school, work medical researchers, ton friends fields. People lost patients lot cases faith country people.

He one best people I've ever met find planet, lucky AF people like able jobs like every day deal mental strain would crush many us.

That said, fucking it. He, quite colleagues, getting point, seen many people die without chance get vaccine (then now), completely drained empathy people chance ability get vaccine choose too.
These wonderful life saving people depend FUCKING BROKEN stupidity many beginning feel like people admitted without vaccine denied care. quote I’m tired putting family risk every single fucking day going work. risk taken vaccines; front lines going another wave it’s due unvaccinated. That’s acceptable functional society. don’t want vax, fine, it’s choice, you’ve forfeited opportunity inpatient care. Best luck you.

This America right honestly embarrasses fuck citizen country scientist works therapeutic development. fucking disgusting. 

These people families hell year now. They've watched people drown lungs, alone, terrified, lucky iPad families could watch last agonizing moments gasp breath. sick fucking sugarcoating this, country broken think fix it. politics deeply entrenched everything life-saving, family-saving, neighbor-saving vaccine political issue, completely agree friend, longer functioning society know way back...

We've called heroes again, solution ease suffering fucking take idiotic country is. countries would kill access vaccines have, really ethically point giving people use countries.

I never thought would say something like this, maybe way back sanity Delta another variant runs roughshod sections country Darwinism thins herd. makes healthcare workers lot innocent people can't take vaccine legitimate reasons collateral damage. situation depressing point... Okay 5 people tiny amount, doesn’t disprove said 5,000 people hospitalized 160M fully vaccinated. Venn Diagram circle. Exactly That’s point. shouldn’t suffer right thing. Florida, become national disgrace Thanks, I'm GA even lower vaccination rates MO. Half country utterly irrational. never wake fact. going kill 100s thousands Americans. Small-government conservative ass. OSHA Venn Diagram circle. time hold force in. care much anti vaxxers scream ""No!"". asking it!! I'm vaccinated got delta variant. First symptoms last Saturday felt pretty crappy 3 4 days. feel completely fine symptoms smell. Get shot nothing worse bad flu, least experience. worst part constantly tired congested. really hate governor Great Plains Florida US. makes sense considering know vaccinated folks also transmit virus. 

Kids 12 cannot vaccinated. 

We’ve asking folks mask awhile protect others complaining anti-maskers, rightly so, don’t get someone thing guy exact thing. 

Situations change learn new information. flexible.    everyone worried kids dying Covid now?

It's binary thing. every kid dies COVID, huge number long COVID symptoms possibly permanent damage. cases lungs. others causes neurological problems. lot unknowns well, since virus around long enough know kids get going dealing 10, 20, years future. seems perfectly logical concerned idiots charge banning mask mandates. Seriously frightening. thankful able keep 9 year old home right now.  Hate break you. RoundUp every food eat comes farm. Even garden, high probability contamination weed killers that’s water supply take back calling Greg Abbott useless cripple, mean still guess even broken clocks right twice day. Governor Satan, epitome “Florida man” legitimately believe wants democrats die score political points? Absolutely criminal. Schools opening top peak, Gottleib correct. Schools designed children's safety. teacher. get people lock gate students ASD bolted could avoid traffic busy road next classroom. child went missing first grade one noticed walking around town. classroom flooded sent kids back in. Parents flipped four months later lab revealed high levels mold. One day, superintendent shows up, says get kids out. grab stuff go new classroom. Four hazmat suits show clean classroom. zero faith schools keeping kids safe, let alone pandemic. Abbott wants make sure safe gain. CA protocols except masks required indoors only. schools started two weeks ago year round schedule. going okay. Looks like 82 kids quarantined 25 infected Tuesday. can't imagine protocol place. Delta R0 8 9. That's two three positive kids one class infecting everyone. come said get vaccination TV. It’s literally he’s done prevent year. send them. many words keep get replaced who? wouldn’t matter stepped not. Another death-cult Republican would take place. Badly researched antivax opinion bad reason take vaccines. Adequately researched antivax opinion welcome reasons take vaccines. Hopefully finding supports correct opinion whether take vaccines don't. Could Irish Spanish type republican. aka best kind B) fascinating ""party small government"" completely removes power small government manage themselves. Yeah terrible america lol Time federal law punishable real hard time. Ferengican ? huge! plus (+) means than, opposed following number k means thousand. 
 
175+ - 175 
175k - 175,000 really understand this, actively trying kill people?  obviously troubling sign, showing vaccines good Delta thought. 

That said, 5 people small sample size determine impact vaccinated vs unvaccinated. hard get much statistical significance small number. aren’t gaining freedom wear masks inside don’t don’t lose freedom forced wear pants outside. explain much detail sounds fucking stupid? We've spent 25 trillion dollars war poverty rich pay net taxes. Party country, humanity. Honestly, one things local govts. need it. Enforce it, make state sue drag court. state, MN opt show records based religion. new religion, Nunya. Nunyabuisness.  That's well good based old data.  delta variant changes things. know, find swords existential connection eastern martial philosophies. Q variant likely apply patrons soon. said businesses kept masks required signs.

Anyways, always wear mask Walmart, want people see shopping haha  government banned something aren’t vaccinated? 

Schools always vaccination requirements, that’s really strange. 

You right get vaccinated, others also right refuse service decision (especially Texas, don’t y’all love private businesses choosing). complete 180 conservative stances show conservatives really believe beyond “I want whatever want” Gov. Greg abbot fucking moronic pos understand. Limited government oversight themselves. poors, POC, women, rest us SOL. toddler.

That say, we're together. Life fair. Covid care right thing. bare minimum. understand mentally blown tired all, truth we're done. thats good thing. doctor would start refusing treatment based personal feelings regarding circumstance requires one need treatment would terrible doctor community. Immunocompromised vaccinated, particular set vaccines really work even vaccination. seems like we're agreement part. testing thing really sucks giant pain ass. really need push businesses local governments enforce mandatory vaccination burden move vaccinated onto unvaccinated belongs. Yeah we're going wait see county 3 weeks (when performances start) see requiring masks well proof vaccination (though way numbers going looks like case, least go back down).

Hopefully avoid another shutdown guess we'll see things develope He's still yet first action curb spread since start pandemic. ran guy wearing mask hiking trail said people could tell Republ*can.  think also entitled crash car speeding wearing seatbelt. Problem affects others around you. Right ya fam 🤘 dunno, there's lot I've problem mask.

But yes, mask guidance rightly prompt ""is right time that?""

Requiring vaccination + masks broadway realistically, desperate attempt keep running all. leans towards farce, conclusion ""nah, packing theater bunch others right smart"". Civilization self crippling downward spiral  he’s prison

You know, technically there's nothing stopping someone running president prison... kids, masks shit. They're going fiddle non-stop, likely forget wear etc.

Actually, mask compliance among younger kids [is better 

Our son in-person schooling last year 2nd grade Connecticut- wear masks except outdoors recess lunch (which eat desks). absolutely problem wearing mask, teacher said class general handled mask-wearing fine. anyone asked obvious question ? Abbott funeral home? one cool antivaxxers die droves? 

Do nfl charge missed work they’ve demonstrated unwillingness get vaccinated. Yeah, that's thought.  someone decides get vaccinated, going take almost 2 months fully effective, assuming mRNA shots. EVERYTHING BIGGER TEXAS!!! INCLUDING MISTAKES! We're 1/5th 1/4th cases nationwide now.

We also massive ""flu"" season Jan 2020 seen weird, flu shot work causing covid like symptoms. almost certainly got hit real first wave then, tests prove vacuum store nurse 16 years…anything else want know? 
Also…what medical experience ability read?
Statistics paper actual people ICU right two different numbers…. New Zealand effectively solved COVID problem closing borders. island country &lt;5 million people, sure include cutting international trade. However, relatively small number people involved global trade, interfaces domestic transport networks often limited. people contact situations limited enough proper oversight, able effectively cut vector international spread.

Last checked, China &lt;100 new COVID cases per day. US 9000 new cases per day, 1/4 China's population. Clearly, they're something right aren't. Antiva listening evidence. support premise shot save life whether protects contagious not. conjunction universal masking get keep contagion level everyone vaccinated. desirable thing worth jab social level. 

But they're going hear that. listen station plays song.  never time history government given back power granted crisis situations.


Quite historian, see. there's literally emergency powers granted recinded pandemic. need make shit up. 

Also, new. parents get vaccinated get kindergarten. wants constituents die become disabled? Serious question: ever-loving hell trying accomplish? Doubling-down bad decision? Trying kill people off?

*Banning* creation measures protect people seems like saying quiet part loud. tbf non vaccines approved. technically. Unreasonable deeper pandemic. Limited federal government leave state. wish stay life much possible includes forcing wear mask. definition limited government. I'm fearful person that's I'm trying like them.

I really hate this. governor Texas determined culture war. hurt back day, god damn vaccine. know CDC lying us all? They're inflating many people died covid also telling us people killed vaccines! /s 

I legitimately someone telling week.  rare: it’s common occurrence dude honest you’re bigger child flipping like that. stated opinion accurate malice.  40% less likely what? 40% less likely compared what? making sense. Someone make daily chart number deaths Texas since Abbot became governor think one annoying parts nowadays virtue signalling posts forced masks coming back. ""Well ***I*** never stopped wearing mine I'm amongst *plague rats* EW unwashed masses.""

Like great congrats. IDK point sound insufferable. main difference analogy cancer transmissible COVID is. hypothetical decision refuse cancer treatment affects body, one's decision vaccinate affects everyone person comes close contact with.

The problem conservatives constantly harp ""big government"" overstepping bounds, textbook example that. private company school system's right act believe best interest employees students require vaccination see fit. drown anti-vax propaganda. can't say once, people need bombarded message. Yes. way covid rates blue areas look covid rates red areas, downplay effects mask mandates vaccinations. Otherwise end red parts Texas that’s overwhelmed covid blue spots well, would kill gop narrative. That’s flu. That’s norovirus. Completely different things. feel shouldn’t even calling stomach flu. reminds General Abbott Sweet Tooth. big true people wanna watch world burn Think crucial well

""Among vaccinated group, one received Pfizer vaccine, remaining three received Johnson &amp; Johnson. vaccinated individuals ranged age 20 70, two underlying health No, it’s literally population Florida taking precautions whatsoever. live near big city don’t astronomical numbers, even tourism, precautions taking place people getting vaccinated. 

I’m sorry state sucks don’t feel bad visiting friends. get butthurt want online nothing going change fact governor Trump loving state HUGE part problem. you’re worried tourists, don’t lobby politicians shut state’s borders? easier come thread? winner. regret dont awards give. point republicans seemingly want people die. aren’t gaining freedom wear masks inside don’t don’t lose freedom forced wear pants outside. get “Fuck it” point throughout world? shits around long seems like phenomena can’t control. people fed light end tunnel feels gone new variant, it’s literally like another virus. I’m ready give shit anymore even though don’t want to. It’s never late. hate “too little late rhetoric” encouraging others get vaccinated. Again, I'm arguing anything. simply telling data actually says seem oddly incapable understanding it.

And even though feel like I've explained pretty clearly several times already, I'll try one time:

*You* repeatedly interpreted what's said ""only 123 vaccinated people hospitalized LA county week"".

That true.

What data says ""123 vaccinated people hospitalized **AND** tested positive COVID week"". best friend MD works veterans hospital spinal cord injury patients. lot people permanent serious health issues, cannot vaccinated. taught pharmacists grad school, work medical researchers, ton friends fields.

We don’t need states. republicans evil. state already dumpster fire far public health concerned, reach train-collision levels bad. Last year plexiglass, mask everyone, daily temperature checks health checks, separation class rooms least 6 feet, kids sent home signs sickness negative test come back 2 weeks time, online option... Etc. 

This year, wear mask feel like it. Someone prohibit use chair anywhere. feel like result much like Trump may downfall Abbot DeSantis Florida come next election. Masks required requiring vaccines insane endorsing downvotes, merely explaining. multiple people know Bama came covid week. 1 vaccinated, one complications covid.

Everyone else claiming fine, feeling like they're dealing sinus infection. Biden made comment “all beds filled Alzheimer’s patients 10 years” something similar month ago. Seemed super strange time. Wonder related? good! know number display characteristics differ country country making sure. hate people like him.  Glad ok!!! Thanks sharing experience. That’s fairly common many respiratory infections. Again, AAP recommending person school.  way prevent uncontrolled spread started mutating. 

If only. 

I bet would have. alas, didn’t. one option. 
/s must really hate Texans  Happy share. 

Roughly 12 hours first, muscle soreness local injection site 18 hours. 24 hours first, headache felt generally yucky day. took acetaminophen helped. 

After second, muscle soreness local injection site. 

After third, again, muscle soreness local injection site. 

First vaccine 1/19/21. Second vaccine 2/11/21. Third vaccine 7/26/21. 

I higher risk, legitimately. T1 diabetics higher risk rest “normal population.” high person anti-rejection drugs (for transplant). Diabetes affects several systems point they’re pseudo immunocompromised. Example, takes longer scratch arm heal. could take longer get common cold. I’m brittle diabetic. keep blood glucose check. Also, wear insulin pump. eat healthy exercise little. I’m pretty active work. sit behind desk maybe half job half I’m running around putting fires. also sleep apnea; use CPAP. also 50 lbs overweight. don’t high cholesterol hypertension, least positives. Yeah, actually call bullshit that. part family part Hispanic community outside Tampa. Getting vaccine access near impossible county two much easier access. Desantis knew picked certain locations. also much easier state tourists areas actual Florida residents get vaccinated areas start vaccination drive. easier access younger person family Florida, one later states open access. good come past year, it'll Republican party longer bullshit they're anything hate group neither. I’m dreading feel coming. miserable, solution see everything power ensure everyone else miserable are. There's whole lot bad statistics thread. Florida resident here. Vaccines still much requirement enroll child school here. Public private. honestly can’t imagine Covid vaccine different others. 

Out 4 kids (19, 17, 14 &amp; 6), they’re vaccinated except baby. starts school August 10, we’ve told even though school can’t require everyone wear masks like last year, still needs wear one times. Important note, that's literally count. five hospitalized. study TINY charts rural, middle America water tables. Pretty much non-existent concentrations New England water supplies.

You notice first RoundUp towns, heavy agriculture. People ""shakes"", lots eye lid twitching. pretty  can't long, really can't.  get used way. Muddled messaging people charge sensationalist headlines help. Society collapse covid. pandemic end. Scott Gottlieb right (big though) end may closer think. California huge population per million test positive, 35th nation. Great question. haven’t seen bill yet. said it’d around $700 insurance asked though Stupid, evil man stupid evil thing.

&amp;#x200B;

""Limited government"" ass. zero cost precaution. Wear mask. turns unnecessary, lost nothing. sounds like we'll need them. completely different question asking $500 precaution might anything.    deaths hospitalization, right[?]

""Hospitalization"" vague term mean anything night supplemental oxygen double lung transplant. Getting vaccine helps ensure wind hospital COVID, stay brief relatively uneventful (and death-free, case needs spelling out): Brytney Cobia said Monday one COVID patients Alabama receive vaccine. [The vaccinated patient, said, needed little expected fully recover. others dying.

In case plain old influenza, vaccine bulletproof either, even so, [""vaccination shown several studies reduce severity illness people get vaccinated still get UK Office National Statistics (ONS) February updated April also sparked concern. showed 9.8% children aged 2–11 years 13% aged 12–16 years reported least one lingering symptom five weeks positive diagnosis. Oh no, think you’re little stupid weren’t able understand difference hypocritical opposing “Big Government” fining private businesses simultaneously progressive problem “Big Government” fine mask mandates. 

It crazy false equivalence mentioned another thread outbreak occurred ""Bear Week"". waiting game run course.

17 months masks closed businesses virtual schools limited travel, personally enough.

Let refuse vaccine take risk (including overwhelmed hospitals), limit access crowded places (sports, concerts, exhibitions, museums), let vaccine developers continue improve adjust.

Other that, let us live lives. honestly makes sick stomach. former teacher also worked public school administration. guess that’s bothers much. I’m sure teachers furious! protesting anything? Everyone exhausted knows? agree son too...as society responsibility protect him. I’m ashamed many people country don’t see that. Fwiw, I’m GA making kids wear masks inside even though vaxxed...I think owe people like you. ive dealing symptoms 9 months mild infection. shit sucks Idaho like TX, shitty mexican food.  I’m that. feel like long term morbidity dark horse pandemic. Soft lockdown incoming. happens going destroy businesses, know destroy businesses even worse? Pretending operate normally ignoring it. Scary thing there's push ban schools requiring COVID vaccines, ban requiring vaccine result anti-COVID vaccine nonsense. goes through, things going huge mess people get first hand experience bad childhood diseases are. thought schools didn’t spread COVID? /s  Apparently science easy, either. There's difference efficacy effectiveness. Yep. need think logically compare risks take. That's I've since last March. led isolate May 2021. got vaxxed waited two weeks. I'm free.

The risk vaccinated person drying Covid extremely comprable lots risks already take, like driving, flu, etc...  really let sue anyway.  too* I'll take good news wherever find comes variant. Hopefully scaring people straight. John graduated HS 2019. He’d done well swim team, even made states, didn’t catch eye recruiter. matter, took student loan. Anything get away tumultuous home life. 

Half way John’s second semester, COVID hit sent home, home longer existed. started gig work pay crash pad tried keep classes he’d already paid for. Meanwhile deemed ineligible COVID relief unemployment, least got parade.

Fast forward today, government decides needs get tested every week, even though somehow managed make appointments doses Pfizer vaccine soon could could get back college. John doesn’t even time sleep. 

At point John completely broken?

John isn’t person particular, story I’ve heard far often.

The structural issues issues. 10-20 years I’m thinking So, basically signed thousand people deaths. exactly “small government”? actually stopped them? threatened them? Texas send national guard enforce unconstitutional legislation, city give up? constitutes next generation? 18 years?  Trump closing border China anything. global pandemic. close border everyone, anywhere, period. enough death yet guy So, total 1/10,000 serious side effects. death rate Covid adolescents similar, less, right? DeSantis consistent nothing else, threw seniors bus earlier pandemic. vulnerable children Florida exposed Delta variant high level contagion. 

The Delta variant potential infect entire classroom day. Cities ID too. 7 billion people world. wait community spread virus zero open won’t see probably least 5 years. Maybe more. 

I’m vaccinated, I’m living normal life don’t relapse depressed state last year put into. want stay inside fine, need understand huge repercussions almost sort preventative measure. Covid caused people 0 risk tolerance mindset insane county hit 17% 2 weeks straight. kids feel like we're time loop. lot plans summer/fall, I'm sure. 


I'm afraid infection, prospect permanent damage terrifies me. God hit bigger tree stopped non-essential international travel (and required strict 2-week quarantines essential travel) soon knew going become pandemic, become pandemic.

This ridiculously untrue. Essential travel still people traveling, infected contagious. Quarantines perfect containment systems. takes one person introduce region community spread starts, role international travel becomes marginal. Look effort countries like New Zealand Australia Thailand put preventing travel still continue outbreaks require periodic domestic lock downs. There'd endpoint sight every country planet tried completely isolate themselves, virus would still soon end restrictions would start spread further. Nothing lobbyists, billionaires, media, donors.

Everything polling voters.

Let lesson. That's politicians care most. donor going donate candidate think can't win. lobbyist tries curry favor people politicians can't win office. need power first. get power? get elected. get elected? people vote you.

Politicians answer us, even people hate admitting means part problem. I’m fully vaccinated healthy. know I’ll fine. It’s existential dread/worrying state humanity pandemic thing. Except cancer contagious virus mutates jumps person person.

If head ass counted masking up, huh? we'd problem. glad Lancaster country set precedent Nebraska issue even state prohibits due county health department predating state department. sure Omaha got away mandates, rest state copies them, Dime Store Lex Luthor gets bored bother again. Safe get case? certainly lower odds, there's still moderate chance get Covid.

Safe much problem Covid even get it? Yep. vax weaken virus chance dying negligibly small, especially school aged somewhat healthy.

People need start accepting catching Covid bad outcome anymore. Good. Less Texans. True, side effects rare begin with. 10% 1 1000 adolescents get side effects all. realize literally lose enough voters covid lose next election?  Man, CDC's job try protect EVERYONE, including unvaccinated. ones extreme risk here, people got shots. concerning CDC enormous risk unvaccinated population, still significant.

Yeah, dolts willingly. case children. literally future. need protect costs.  thinking fully vaccinated. wrong.

Are sure Delta variant? See last three days, plateauing high numbers I'm not. school funding try keep remote option. I've signed remote school elsewhere case, guess I'm homeschooling youngest public remote option available school district can't find funding. Glad quit job partner manage work safe support family, otherwise we'd spot rest neighbors also contributing spread.. feel folks around actually care neighbors can't work home ability remote school.

Stinks live area opposed masks vaccinations, even parents conspiracy theorists, moving complete waste. already want leave, last couple years would convinced us.  flat believe number. Many members family outright dispute number dead, withouy sort evidence logic back up.  Free-Dumb Lol wrong. said felt issue, would harvesting upvotes. fake internet points, where's fun echo echo chamber? said people need wear masks take steps prevent spread almost everyone population vaccinated.

If read far **2nd sentence** article, see saying vaccination stop *once vaccination rate high enough*, then, extra precautions required people vaccinated spoiling things everyone else. evolutionary perspective, necessary reduce (spread) vaccinate many people possible fast possible across globe. According worldometers, since 27th, still round 23 000 cases, gone 27 000 cases 28th 30 000 29th.

The problem might noise, might random chance, might explained million things we're simply way close fall cases say anything situation. know whether go back up, keep falling going happen wait something like two three weeks. point idea cases seemingly sudden fall. now, way early even speculate. dragging feet making vaccine accessible lower income areas

That's DeSantis-specific issue though. national issue. We're even dealing California. Californians enrolled Medi-Cal vaccinated far lower rates overall population 58 counties, according state disparity reveals strong economic divide vaccinated unvaccinated throughout 45% Medi-Cal enrollees eligible COVID-19 vaccine (those 12 older) received least one dose July 18, compared 70% eligible Californians, state officials said Thursday. 

What state Florida early stages vaccine distribution work Publix (who federal agreement CDC) distribute vaccines stores. course, get vaccine Publix need live near Publix, disadvantage communities historically underserved good grocery stores (food deserts, call them). issue goes beyond DeSantis. Eventually stores, including Walmart, would start distributing vaccine Florida. 

What Florida let perfect enemy good, prioritized seniors regardless whether perfect distribution plan. hyperbolic Publix backlash, make efforts get vaccine rural minority communities, something probably already planned. midterms going awesome! republican left vote! think ""breakthrough"" infections breaking entire vaccine. Vaccines beef body's defenses, individuals' defenses broken through, across vaccines. lot factors contribute breakthrough infections, what's important unless immunocompromised, risk serious illness very, low regardless (FDA-emergency-approved) vaccine received. vaccine still offering plenty protection. Former President Trump. Gotta remember name forget next election. He's gonna run 2024 best forget bullshit he's done. Farmers probably bad example here. farmers (even family farms) moving hundreds thousands, even millions dollars per year farms. don’t get keep money obviously, that’s scale required run farm business days. you’ve got much cash flow, stock market real impact much sell crops for. Towns run ads saying citizens make decision mask up. here’s **free** gun qualifying purchase Seems strange someone staunchly pro life…. Maybe abortion thing really controlling women all. Hmm… Republicans love death. Would say governor prohibited banning abortion? active measures actually increase freedom. Well saying variant 1000 times viral load original strain wonder can't contain it. No, vaccine holding well. holds severe symptoms / hospitalizations, hold infection nowhere near well. There's big difference two. honestly probably real way out… get vaccinated folks unless you’re sheltering place Delta gonna catch ya. clinic longer allowed require facemasks Greg Abbott's executive order. clinic state Texas/ government entity. ask wear masks can't force to, fined $1000. Keep mind also, none 882 people died. Zero. I’m advocating let rip point temporary brick wall

This seems way out. we're essentially opposite ""flattening curve"", we're letting infections run rampant, (at least among unvaccinated) significant increase quickly followed peak almost significant decrease. UK pretty good example immunity isn’t thing one wants tell anyone. 


I suppose possible, steep drop-off deaths hospitalizations globally following vaccination campaigns would indicate case. point Delta, either going vaccinated going catch it. Potentially both, breakthrough infections seem given, outcomes typically mild illness (not unlike cold-causing coronaviruses). means point, general spread naturally slow down. Even future variants eventually hard time propagating there's widespread baseline immunity virus general. gives anxiety people unrelated medical emergencies won’t get timely treatment suffer others poor decisions. 

Tots pears, friend. hope ok. government took away freedom speech. Twitter, private entity, simply decided fire customer. delta vaccinated people spread disease. know one crystal ball, chances EU restricts entry even vaccinated Americans again? find crazy we're allowed Brits aren't. I've got trip Austria Germany September I'd really like take.  Well problem lot families can’t keep young kids home either. hope least teachers vaccinated it’s 100 percent course I'm little surprised include OANN poll. (Not sure viewership stacks numerically Newsmax, they're anti-vax train well.) they're bringing back unemployment new stimulus package mandatory vaccines, gives damn? local area Provincetown never heard apparent multi day gay orgies you, reason, think everyone must know I'm saying. People sheltered unaware niche thing happens close you. I'm guessing given tone response parent. Either I, sympathize parents concerned long term, unknown side effects. Dr. Griffen TWIV estimates 1 30 kids experience form 'long' covid. Sounds high given news reports, repeats regularly respected doctor handles cases daily.  
Of course, really data moment whether vaccination would even prevent kids. Everything bigger Texas especially stupidity. love guys use big government force local municipalities things campaigning bug government. data right-hand side [this shows surgical mask prevent getting infectious dose 30 minutes 50 hours based infected person wearing.

Thats based person within 6 feet infected whole time.

That document appears created May Delta really boomed I'd say there's less protection now. Especially given time get infectious dose Delta seems much lower.

So answer question - dont think Delta specific study there. 

But surgical masks seem offer good protection given 6 feet someone infectious 30 mins seems unlikely cases. 

N95 seems much better protection obviously.  death rate was….ready….ZERO. Yep, Quebec started offering people one AstraZeneca one mRNA extra mRNA shot want travel. There's safety data this, course, logically fine. explanation people ignorant fuck either believe virus real think dangerous.

Some Republicans already backtracking pro-covid stance recommending vaccines now. certainly want virus continue spreading they're seeing primarily killing unvaccinated now.

The unvaccinated, worth noting here, largely GOPs base supporters. They're losing base. literally article? react headline? lazy get? 😂 principles beyond maintaining Heirarchy. *as* effective. Please look Cape Cod study done so. Covid going away ever. think said they’re seeking approval 12 September “There way come back bite us. definitely pan constituents.”

-Gov. Abbott probably seems counter intuitive kill base... mostly anti-vaxxers He's even competent enough Governor yet are. mention we're gonna start getting swarmed plague rats everyone's cancelling Vegas plans due mask mandate... First rule Republican find deep hole....bring backhoe dig deeper hole. anyone mentioned ZERO people died 882 number? Anyone?? Whew, good thing voted Republicans. imagine Democrat governor? Trying meddle people's lives, making decisions them? Good thing voted small government free like God intended! local hospital hour ago

Smart people surrounded morons.

Stay safe buddy!  Businesses individual establishments still require masks. EO saying CITY can't mandate it. Roll tide thought mask mandate back effect let come this?

There's ""we"" here. inherited broken fucking system came me. masks stop delta, virus infectious chicken pox. refusal vaccinate children combined insistence return school suicidal, especially teachers. happens 13 beds used up? happens need 300 more? It’s like slow motion pileup know crash, sure bad it’ll be.

And meanwhile Governor spraying water highway make sure ice. 🤣 Love it. Criminally stupid Agreed, know structural issues, sorry affected. Right tools possibility actually testing enough stop spread, factors get way.

PS: said ""and probably testing enough"". wanted highlight factor high positivity tends indicate. UK, group highest infection rate 20-29yr olds...   military told Anthrax vaccine safe effective. Glad dodged bullet. people served disability dead due vaccine. Florida Canada, even old people there.  don’t want kid get vaccine virus. hoping enough adults could step get came decision. However, please remember kids die year flu (with flu vaccine!!!) covid since entire thing started. unknown part potential long term effects. seems unsound fears point though. they're conservative governments, telling small government do.

Conservatives lie state want small government, want things want. Big government decision small minded government crimes humanity. COVID. think closest thing actual study available no, that's 6 months old. can't find actual new study. need another 2 weeks even determine UK reversed.

Or idiots?

Just theory... know long term effects even mild case yet though, would prefer catch all, honestly way everything going, gun rights going become important ever. Don’t let one side guns… point need get acceptable number adverse events virus, including willfully unvaccinated. vaccinated people die Covid. cannot get vaccine die Covid.

We accept tens thousand flu, rhinovirus, pneumonia deaths every year. Including lots kids. 

Are really going stop lives next decade prevent minimal amount deaths (I say minimal almost Covid deaths individuals chose get vaccinated). sure never wears mask crowded spaces around people doesn’t know vaccinated, right? Agreed 100%. This. Kids likely die covid (however fact didnt republicans ok speaks itself), long covid rough. kids entire lives ahead they'll essentially mentally kneecapped live worse life could have. idiots wanted play victim use people's kids fodder culture war enemy reality, really result constantly seething impotent rage likes Dr. Suess, Fauci, US Women's soccer team, communities getting ravaged preventable disease.

I've cut anyone take covid seriously. tolerance willfully ignorant people. going copy message print bring next appt LOL thank you. right, many articles bad telling us take vaccine etc :( live well vaccinated, liberal area.

Public health policy requires buy proposing social distancing get buy in. I'm Springfield MO Delta Central two months. One hospitals announced 6 deaths vaccinated. Average age 77 immunocompromised big risk unmasked fully-vaccinated person (Moderna) spreading coronavirus unvaccinated people live with? studies conducted give hard numbers this?

I'm trying decide personal policy going forward since think enough Americans ever vaccinated achieve herd immunity. one household unvaccinated, I'm worried strangers grocery store, mall, movie theater, etc. 

I'm trying decide whether resolve mask-up public forever (at least indoor spaces). disagree this. circumstances, business able decide associate with, applies circumstances related pandemic. big government, authoritarian style move condemned. stop creating percentages using total vaccinated people country. It’s almost bad calculation antivaxers use.

You thing calculating many unvaccinated cases percent unvaccinated people country. also meaningless small percentage.

The best way show correctly risk unvaccinated person getting Covid compared risk vaccinated person getting Covid. Variants change name game - society need ready pivot without throwing tantrum.  Agreed. hell someone world view opposed? seen titles like that. fact minorities low-paying industries continue working frontlines. exposure time CV19, cases communities. Also, higher percentage multi-gen households increases chance CV19 cases. Great, comes Delta? next variant named state gave birth it. means covid burn population quickly. bad US is, there's around 50% full vaccination probably additional 10-20% prior immunity, last forever, reinfection rare, even one shot covid vaccine grants significant protection. made similar comment last night. slides clearly weren’t meant public consumption exhaustive presentation information contained. One slides even labeled “confidential data subject change. “ likely presentation presented slides information study methodology, sampling characteristics, full key graphs models, caveats, context. Yet people going around making authoritative statements room. Hmm, hindsight metaphor bit mixed. Maybe GA needs desert... Atlanta needs island  I’m fully vaccinated (which am) vaccine still works well severe illness death, still need take precaution? getting COVID similar bad cold vaccinated, why? wear masks flu seasons?

The shift narrative frustrating. Screaming vaccines still get infected stop death enough motive get unvaccinated get vaccinated. mostly people yelling since start COVID 99% survival is. Free die cold electricity, free die due COVID, free die due poverty. free die general.   entirely disagree entirely agree either. 


 suspect they're blaming unvaccinated two reasons. 


1. vaccine offer significant protection vast majority people spreading Covid right unvaccinated.
2. hoping get vaccination rates increased blaming unvaccinated.

I'm defending distortion data.  


Also curious, stats beginning feel juked? New Mexicalifornia remove Texas US? lol exercise autonomy getting vaccinated wearing seatbelt…but things choice, force. sure hard understand that. I'm Springfield MO Delta Central two months. talked customer got second time Delta told living hell nothing like first

Everybody know vaccinated gets Delta tries check hospital can't breathe R chickenpox 3.7-5 amongst vaccinated people, we'd constant state overwhelming number chickenpox cases. literally limiting government acting, much simpler could be? mother watched Fox News decades didn’t start acting top emotional extremely one sided politics got Facebook….so yeah believe this. saw article fully vaccinated people likely spread delta variant rates unvaccinated people Yikes. 

And no, I’m talking completely unfortunate hairstyle. 

Stay safe there. Like even do!? They’ve thrown children wolves Fox News sewer. Facebook sludge inside. Oh my! Bless heart! sounds like ordeal go through. mother watched Fox News decades didn’t start acting top emotional extremely one sided politics got Facebook….so yeah believe this. rational thinking person will, course, *want* get COVID, rational thinking person come conclusion vaccinated reduces risk getting well risk hospitalized get it. vaccinated individual's symptoms reduced/subdued (in comparison unvaccinated person), risk transmission reduced well. Im really starting feel republicans want never end making worse silly things like masks, eviction moratorium, pua.

All guise ""my freedom"" run marxist narrative. Literally projection.

Abbot seems like real stand guy. /s remove tax exemption?

Clearly, political party disguise. brother (democrat) tell member church told could democrat faithful member time. Christ amighty.  Good luck. This. Mass vax campaigns. Keeping venues closed masks place 1 month more. Vastly diff6from US approach. Texan 'essential' (Pizza delivery, skating carhop) hope gets fucked ass covid.

The fucking pizza place 4 FOH get covid told tell customers foh vacation closed days. Sanic managers get pissy anything safety, day one dipshit assistant managers said 'we masks anymore.'

I’m terrified – I’ve done everything right, I’ve caregiver husband many months needed break. guess I’m looking encouragement rationality…

My friend vaccinated. 
My husband vaccinated. likelihood – even immunocompromised – getting COVID another vaccinated friend, giving COVID, develop severe illness pretty low, right?

Either way two tests scheduled next week days apart. leave Airbnb morning hotel room leave Sunday. *Now fantasizing burial mounds made wedding cake* Wrong, funeral services emergency rooms staffs quite well. Get vaccine. Protect family. That's really do.  Yh card although could faked? I've always thought vaccine passport secure digital guess card wins US culture war, wins elections.

Vaccinated people still much safer non vaxxed, elderly people higher risk death event get sick. two things true. local union that? locals PA got sucked one big one KML. guess gerrymandering voting districts successful conservative voters needed anymore? literally killing base. enough people got vaccinated first time wouldn’t problem now.

He stumbled delivery HARD, really believe intent stay ""Fool once, shame you, fool twice."" something effect. sure. definitely taking heart, monitoring situation.

The CDC giving data today well.

And get Delta joke. went 24 cases June 28th many days 20's/30's prior, 200 cases yesterday popular tourist region.

Last summer 20s/30s restrictions loosened, took October get there. Portugal (we one first countries affected Delta), cases grown since June week seen decrease numbe rof cases Rt already 1. Also, wave reached maximum 3300 cases/day second wave (October-November) reached 6500 cases/day third wave (December - January) reached 13000 cases/day Thanks Oh sure, all, chuckling bit fact something mortality rate parents like “where sign kid up?” know prevent serious illness line.  


Good point though numbers fear — term “500% higher mortality rate” sounds scary, right? many coronavirus headlines include numbers days, hard put perspective. “Are scary numbers scary numbers?” people. all. Imagine thinking biggest problem facing state people wearing masks virus already killed 600k Americans. up, mean down. Haha! It’s perfectly consistent. Texans don’t want government telling do. Hot Wheelz says “the government won’t telling do.” point say don’t wear mask. blows face don’t worry lesson learned hard way. losses mount guarantee you’ll see uptick mask wearing. personal choice mandate. complete asshat.

I see nothing online presentation materials putting higher 5-8. need another analogy actually one reported comment. disgusting sorry someone said you. remember shocked much someone would say that. course federal government CDC serious danger completely losing control narrative. presentation getting leaked disaster. they’re significantly less sick. vaccine worth shit Moderna.

Lambda already exists, seem able outpace Delta   Don’t worry, TrumpJesus save them!  **America**: ""Good lord happening there!""

**DeSantis**: ""No.""  Hell, 7%, thats 7 100 people infected average. NYC, encounter 400 people walking two blocks parts. I'd sure AF wearing mask too... guess, large amount non vaccinated people susceptible infection providing virus cozy place spread one next -that's discount vaccinated people could (just less effectively). every transfer chance mutate again. set stone rule stating vaccines received effectively deter combat next variant. Anyone else also concerned dog-rat mutants running sewers? fucker. much pro-life one worst education systems country. 

HMMMMMM I'll waiting go plays, concerts, symphonies, etc masks required. Would one. live alone? Discussion people useless. agree mostly joking pick Saban Tuberville senator I’m picking Saban way runs org. based fact properly complete sentence org insanely successful took control think would better last idiot literally job besides grifting.

Edit: watching trump try run football program would comedy highest order Well funny thing is...they mandating vaccines Broadway guests, also requiring masks. get. Bombshell study released today states virus continues mutate among vaccinated. way end vaccinated wear masks slow/halt using bigger government tell little governments cannot do... That's exactly thinking. question think is, far climb drop? wearing masks Alabama? ya think got it? seen? reading internet like rest us? kid can't single-handedly spread dying car crash entire family. add anxiety likely, yes. Maybe year, maybe next year likely get sometime life.

I can’t imagine respectable scientists thinks going away point.  That's key point explaining elsewhere. mRNA influence cellular DNA needs additional foreign proteins *whole virus* bring along code for.  
These vaccines single simple strand mRNA, read ribosomes make proteins naturally degrades less day. There's mechanism self-replication reverse transcription present. many voters going die, insane Considering well half kids 12-15 vaxxed, dont see reason suspect things changed way makes survey unreliable. alternative facts: 

- Rice grains chess board. Crazy shit indeed. Iirc FDA standards longer trials full approval given. trials ran concurrently situations like take long time. 

Also, like half government, they’ve handicapped four years last admin wasn’t January could start functioning like support actually get anything done. definitely nervous mine wore n95, I'm recognizing mostly unfounded anxiety, real stress danger. Facebook Trash outdoor wedding week ago. I'm frightened I've picked up. I'm feeling weird chest (could anxiety too?).

Interacting people huge drag, I'm watching performers stage, another face darkness, cares? way pull school home school them? That’s bs. God want nightmare already. Yes random, natural selection occurs “strongest” mutations succeed. comes viruses, “strongest” mutations ones increase infectious decrease mortality. families still kids wear them
to school? What's potential reinfection delta Exactly. people think pandemic hoax kept hospital. vaccinated point deserve care. worried that, don’t visit friends unvaccinated kids get tested. Cases Delta seem dropped UK Netherlands recently could well explain that. We’ll see US follows. President different senator. senator easy hell. 

You take meetings rich people, take money vote way want. 

To good senator easy too. ask law would benefit normal Americans. so, vote it. not, vote against. rich people meetings, order expensive item, take money vote interests hurts people. Stay vigilant, despite fully vaccinated. still know long-term consequence Sars-nCoV infection. still spread virus… reminder career politicians care health wellbeing. They, instead, made whole job getting reelected. useless words feel like flop thoughts “it’ll ok” type thoughts.

Murderer   Cmon 100,000 way much. don’t think go 30,000 confirmed cases. honestly won’t ever know real case count feel point mist people don’t get tested. Ok, thanks sharing this. 
I kept seeing people post 10-12 couldn’t life track down. sure enough? may've covered classic covid, thing far contagious. Whatever plan choose, sure infect him. worried vaccinating young people consecutive boosters may exacerbate issues see second doses young population (I remeber fever common second dose, pericarditis). Shouldnt worried that? NC great. Don’t lump southern states together. info comes here:  Id rather mask lockdown really bothered it. regardless, think vaccine mandates precident mask mandates. It’s shame researchers medical professionals even need give consideration vaccine skeptics. stupid shall punished. Something always said Navy. leaning way home school. It’s rough want go back class interact classmates misses seeing Delta rise us nervous cannot get vaccinated yet history lung issues.  Fun whole family! notes mask requirement employees ""not applicable  
all stores. Managers refer CDC site updates relevant

So county county customer requirement. Quick! Everybody act surprised! Damn. Thanks work do. patients vaccinated? available Israel mention applying emergency use US. get advice doctor I'd worried, personally worry many reasons, primary kids much risk dying. Something like 400 dead 18 months... That's flu season numbers. science pretty clear outdoor transmission rare.  virus mutations absolutely random. think odds another mutation ends vaccine effectiveness entirely likely COVID ever getting consistent case/death level like flu season.

There's really scientific support point. delta variant slightly degrades vaccine effectiveness. theoretically possible huge mutation occurs we're back square one? Yeah. also theoretically possible bat living neighbor's attic carrying Covid-21. likely? No.

Delta tearing unvaccinated communities, fairly predictable outcome. think anyone expected come quite strong, there's reason think different delta outbreaks, steep rise pretty steep fall. guarantee, there's reason yet think likely.

I'm trying invalidate disappointment, try shake doomsday forever-pandemic scenarios. They're realistic bum out. *just another That’s interesting information. I’ll look @Chise further. Yes, main point. R0 gone \~3 \~8. problem. Vaccines designed prevent infection prevent disease (as repeatedly stated Maurice Hilleman). overwhelming majority vaccinated fine DELTA. vaccinated -especially patients fall high risk group -will not. pay heavy price. Luckily, 65+ age group also greatest rates vaccination. lambda getting started No, eat meat.  Honestly idea considers healthy lifestyle.  honestly, family mostly locked away whole time, technically they've followed enough guidelines likely get sick (although, us, neighbor super sick last year january. Covid considered here, month long sickness, cough jus go away. always wonder). country? There's lot countries trash ""news"" read article all? People going required negative test (or vaccination) enter person infected everyone have. Either false negative test person got COVID test event. people think asked wear mask pandemic 1984 never questioned putting helmet riding bike child, even world would arguably better place right refused. He's going murder state can’t believe narrative pushed; folks need take precautions stop hoping go away. 

Completely irresponsible. Delta going mainly effect regions low vaccine rates.

I'm Springfield MO raging unabated higher hospitalizations everyday nobody vaccinated around here.

It suck getting kids hospital school coming right up.

For part highly vaccinated areas worry much get tested get back (free testing still widely available everywhere) don’t go home test negative. someone lives WA state, I’m glad city county 70% vaxxed people around believe science. 

We’re even record 44+ days recordable rainfall, we’ve much sunny weather summer already. 

When time cut America’s wang FL? YES LOCKDOWNS AMERICA!! School starts monday us. meet teacher yesterday half kids didnt wear masks... f***** Broadway rules, place least October apply 41 Broadway theaters, require audiences wear masks, **except eating drinking.**

Literally what's point mandating masks, then? places ban food drinks? concessions profitable? Society can’t afford stupider. Gene Wilder said...morons. Unfortunately protected thing cry taken away. charter rights (for Canada least). hospitals capacity, two-thirds adult patients isolation home, increases chance children infected, said Edhie Rahmat, executive director Indonesia nonprofit health-care group Project HOPE.

""Post-vaccination Infections Overall""

I can't get good screenshot mobile, One best resources available IMO Car crashes contagious. people concerned kids getting seriously ill Covid. 
The big concern many school vector infect whole community. parent young children probably know pretty much every cold flu household starts kids bringing home school. Arizona. local mandates kind. thought read ""california"" first...   doubles every week! They’ll either dead immune time! delta covid infectious chickenpox, effective surgical masks. Like 50%? less? can't find online Seems like really well thought out, definitely politically motivated decision. expect society post-911 demonized cultures wear face coverings? Saw anti-mask movement coming miles away. thing surprises haven’t yet somehow linked plot impose sharia law something. mind ask is? local mask mandate requiring customers wear one? play ""Texas Taliban"" one proof make conspiracy theorists dig deeper say something like ""that's government sponsered lies! They're hiding truth!"" bull spit like lol. mo-Ron governor goes wrong Masks don’t bother general don’t understand anyone hates virulently personally.

As Broadway, would go show mask + vaccine requirement.  probably would go unless required both. point it’s clear vaccine passports essential. Also, rapid vaccine development new variants hyper necessary. Pfizer beginning trials delta despite knowing delta since least May. Pretty much everybody except Israel found protection symptomatic disease. also weird brain disease 1918 pandemic (Encephalitis lethargica (EL) post-encephalitic Parkinsonism) even though flu strain.

Also, flu vaccines help prevent heart attacks, leading researchers believe flu may increase risk heart Someone sue civil court heard repeatedly every wave: ""ah, looks like we've hit kind herd immunity"" new wave would happen new variant prove case. one really handle hows whys behind waves. Mandate not, I'm masking follow CDC Guidelines. know what, stuff day saw good 60% people also choosing wear masks inside stores went to. surprising see. free will.. mandate here. going get rapid PCR test Sunday upon return, two tests scheduled later week. hopeful masking distancing (we live SoCal windows also always open), sleeping separately, sufficient. I’m already sick trying can. Good thing they're super spreader sports event. CDC track breakthrough infections unless results hospitalization death. data referring to?

I'm holding $1,000 unfortunately may also confusing vaccine monoclonal antibody treatment. - vaguely remember someone saying ""made fetus cells"" never really considered -- think 100% correct. Lol, that's really whole lot better... Sure beats Facebook! big filter Reddit, depending mods pre-existing views community create lot bias would imagine.

Was /s intended btw? Might gone head XD Also confirmed vaccine scientist works moderna empathizing scenario? get tested? This. It’s pretty simple:

1.	Get fully vaccinated. 
2.	Wear mask indoors. 
3.	Talk doctor specific measures stop soliciting medical advice strangers Reddit. Exactly interfere God. chose get sick, maimed die, must working mysterious ways. /s Small correction, infected vaccinated individuals spread rate, less infected-vaccinated-individuals.

Vaccines still good, reduced level compared ability counter alpha. reusable cloth replacement filters? able order today. weeks ago, restock coming good time. already sold small filters, think mask comes least few. 

I really hope smooshes face (and nose!) correctly. lol -- true. became convinced lot people understand point masks, think wearing like wearing magic bracelet something, wards corona existing. understand filter respiratory openings. think Huntsville PhDs per capita. maybe state too? Probably combination small population state + huge number PhDs Huntsville. Compared populous states like CA. PhDs get diluted large pop.  Travel bans zero covid policies. past year covid become 10X transmissible.

If infection low level awaited vaccines Alpha Delta variant never entered US - vaccination alone would meant we’d literally zero daily cases right now. almost like lying principles. Again. She’s legit. That’s profile picture. Read tweets. She’s diving information presented CDC, dumbing us laymen. She’s feisty hell well informed. Reminds wife- also scientist, immunologist like Chise. media plastered UK, SA, Brazil variants screens nonstop 2-3 months, none variants became major problem. 

By time Delta came around, people apathetic thought media trying stir panic again, closing borders India would enough address it. 

The media largely contributed people seeing Delta non-issue June. Fuck, I’m heading Phish today. Pretty freaked. Texas, y’all got really bad leadership. 

Maybe consider voting different people one topic… can't that. Neither federal government cases. provinces drop hammer now. hate fool much. impeached read Florida ranks 25th currently stat. oxymoron. get news matter much whether perform fact-checking crosschecking given news story.  sound like loser. think immediate push doctors hear health officials hear makes good story honestly people know get vaccine believe stories believe affect see going work. #1 thing USA could done flat pay people get shots. biden calling $100 feel that's enough financial incentives table day one. spent trillions dollars everything else. mind boggling. realize still would get 100% vaccinate would suggest could gotten well 70% lot faster -- especially poor(er) parts country. Well that's productive. link data referring to? 

Just there's confusion, antagonistic post. trying research. public schools trying require masks. executive order would make parents ignore mask rules kids consequences. Yes!! like viruses evolve resistance best vaccines science make. much coronavirus donate campaign? could pay live Texas. Shithole It’s top comment That’s measure vaccine efficacy. tell insurance company preexisting condition. They'll deny coverage! Ok, fair point. right. 

He's small government, government small level office. Anything local that, never mind huge diverse Texas is, get bent.  true all. Why? Texas deliberately trying go back time? Provincetown popular gay destination large parties. It’s packed summer. know large outbreak weeks ago mention fact CDC estimated 115 million infections end March 2021 (35% population), we've many infections since then, studies keep finding recovered people levels immunity similar vaccinated people. long, we're going run people neither infected injected. point, may still spread, levels like now, we'll strongly protected hospitalization death catch it. Short answer, pre-Delta bad. know, looking worse. bullshit like still dealing this. 

Imagine idiots bothered wear masks year ago. makes wonder fact barely breathe nose never got COVID surrounded close quarters weeks (whole family got me). getting coughed plenty physical contact, shit seemed bounced right me. averaging around 217k 1st doses start month around 339k 1st doses day now. peaked 2.5 million doses day around spring. we’re still moving waaay slower could moving. 

Delta workplace requirements motivating people get shots, we’ve got LOT work do. Correct cocktail napkin math I’m wrong, looks pace would take us well year vaccinate rest eligible population. 😬

(Thinking probably 125-150 million unvaxed eligible folks, we’re getting 0.34m 1st shots arms day) would mean vaccinated ones danger unvaccinated, way around. That's I'm glad I'm vaxxed up. could UK way vaccinated US there's far less risk overwhelmed hospitals like US.

If people spreading covid UK, majority asymptomatic mild due vaccines, less concern US areas &lt; 40% vaccine uptake. Republicans want smaller government Democrats office. Reagan, Bush &amp; Trump every Republican congress since, grown budget possibility attenuation variant itself? vital deletion somewhere code can't worked around identified yet? Probably since UK sequencing anyone. Wishful thinking part.... Israel still far lower cases UK per capita basis. Ron DeSantis possibly dumbest human planet. hope anyone half brain takes ever dipshit says files foolish. spike show rolling average, spike - normal fluctuation. 

Sorry - wrong. well measured spike time well measured spike time. Period. Read basics FWHM data measurements. kind irresponsible grade-school level understanding see climate deniers use argue climate change happening confusing weather climate, dangerous levels nitrates water reported averaged confusing daily ingestion weekly, lead gas bad rise lead local water real spike, .... etc.  news, Governor Abbott still piece shit. Texas.jpg Restrictions keep cases manageable people get vaccinated. *feels* like impeachable offense dereliction duty protect constituents. don’t know law well enough. Probably nothing happen.    keep Texas quarantined? Exactly. Way many would go grain long want clubs closed exactly. Covid endemic … absolute moron  come surprise. Despite data came today back square one. CDC still cites 75-85 percent change infection. Oh, know it. see one Mountain Home?!  care. got vax, decent protection. can't control people bodies. want it, get nobody make them. Health officials going flying around Canada helicopters dart-guns loaded COVID vaccine, shooting antivaxxers air like polar bears nature documentary. generated controversy bluntly saying pandemic fault unvaccinated, recall race-related controversy recently. Maybe missed it?

She very(!) far perfect this, give modicum credit. kept mask mandate much longer neighboring states. far avoided (some) ultra-crazy shit like see Texas Florida.

That said, would still give performance 'F', ""higher"" F neighboring governors. Wdym reasonable measures? end? wear mask chances someone else catching given day 10% instead 30%? long enough time frame goes effectively 100% point? 

If actual goal like wear hospital capacity increases vaccine makes sense, wear mask take transient measures indefinitely just.. why? article mentions large events Barnstable County I, gay, infer means

What mean? Also red tide, definitely not. Interestingly really seeing rise deaths, cases moment. hope Texas secedes rest country watch burn like dumb piece shit is. layman's guess would lot people vaccinated + lot natural infections = lots people antibodies many people left infect.

That’s National constitution. took state’s right abolish slavery away states. fact, 3 first 5 pieces Article 1 section 9’s “Bill rights” slavery directly, protecting slave state’s interests. probably also due fugitive slave act. “The 125,682 ""breakthrough"" cases 38 states represent less .08 percent 164.2 million-plus people fully vaccinated since January.”

Well least putting by-line instead burying article still…. think lot people hold mistrust it’s FDA approved. I’m vaccinated myself, find argument bit stupid. token people argue government banning certain hazardous things overreach.. really winning. Probably? That's playbook 40 years.

And working hold faith humanity, realizing that, opinion least, lot we're seeing evidence broken system raises broken people, rather human nature somehow 'bad.' Belief human goodness something that's worth fighting for. early times covid pandemic something crisis faith humanity, though think way time, kind thinking helped get sense optimism intact.

We've landed two party system one party ran combination people mentality murderous children deny ounce reality suit actual Human scum willing lie take advantage first group, party made people stones and/or common fucking sense much even recognize party doing, nevermind actually anything meaningful it.

American democracy fucking dying every day, people like Abbot allowed take courses action clearly (read; painfully obvious anyone working brain) lead otherwise preventable needless deaths, political economic gain, one actually hold accountable it. American democracy dying direct result one parties actively poisoning never-ending effort accrue power deceive people, party marches business usual. American democracy murdered politicians political majority continue view committing slow painful murder broad daylight valid political rivals rather truly are; *enemies people openly abuse corrupt democracy gain turning actually brainwashed base easily controlled pawns best legitimate domestic terrorists worst.*

The divide happened America, allows people like Abbot retain power matter what, great people side divide might well living entirely different realities other. divide going healed either political majority mans drags political minority reality kicking screaming, political minority gets truly desperate plunges us civil war and/or total authoritarianism people *forced* violence. zero future business usual country's politics seriously risk destroying United States rate. Abbott proven time time right thing. Republican thing. Constituents matter people. Pushing agenda matters. love overpriced Mickey ice bars guess I’m vaccinated, that’s fucking stupid.

So, someone passing law restricts government making law imposes fine imprisonment protecting individual freedom limited government. 

Glad could help. War, war never changes… mean, yeah? point, yeah is.

Really? me, small inconvenience, like wearing seatbelt carrying Masking doesn’t anything me.

You noticed difference, that's expected. Keep mind, protect you. know vaccinated people asymptomatic enjoy living like that, I’m sure 2020 fucking breeze, makes sense **some people eager bring masking back return things last year.**

Actually, opposite: mask wearing facilitates fewer restrictions. Cities businesses...  know vaccinated guests catch source (i.e. unvaccinated). Exactly, talking it? feel im put risk long covid permanent damage knowledge risk make informed decisions. anti-mask thing drives crazy. big deal wear mask? 3-year-old without complaining. still brazenly stupid move even political expediency angle. Elections Florida tend decided narrow margins net loss even 10,000-20,000 voter base could dire political consequences him. completely agree. Masks barrier social interaction. actually inhibit socialization development children. wore mask mid May mandates started dropping. I've needed times since every time I'm reminded much hate masks. Seeing masked faces knows long sounds dystopian miserable. absolutely downsides masks never understand forever maskers. truly wonder people give up. pandemic certainly enabled antisocial behavior lot people.

As vaccinated person, I'm done masks. Mandate vaccine something anti-vaxxers, leave vaccinated people alone.  teachers babysitters? educators? Yes stop city Austin passing city mask ordinances several times. literally talking information given CDC slides. It’s thing earlier actually sourced information whereas spouted rhetoric. 

Thank verifying nobody listening you. Yep, partner's birthday said going get glass (having never attempted buy concessions Broadway before), want come back empty-handed else would turned right around. nursing shortage gonna grow mandating vaccine nurses. Yeah going go fucking well getting people vaccinated. ""Vaccines nothing, need mask forever"" FUCK. THAT. CDC still reporting 75% efficacy rate infection 90% efficacy preventing severe covid new report. He's inadvertently making state blue killing unvaccinated supporters. vaccine mandates passports needed, masking putting bandaid gaping wound.   thinking vulnerable populations strong survive not? Guess ill stay Chicago bit longer till blows literally isn’t. He’s forcing businesses operate certain way. Sounds pretty ORWELLIAN Sucks kid, then. apparently shit stopping viruses spreading. 93% delta hospitalization. ethical, actually opposite.  banned wearing mask. Everyone wants wear mask option wear mask anyone also option. government say it. Yeah it’s like flu, right? /s you’re saying it’s ok lie get people vaccinated? 

Do realize people aren’t getting vaccinated? made joke found fox news grandfather brain damage fall recently. Gotta cope somehow. 500 infections sounds like lot there's way know vaccine stop 5,000 infections occurring.

If did, 25% cases unvaccinated. That's biggest problem democracy. Mob rule. exactly.

Delta crazy shit People working (and lambda), take time. lot vaccine R&amp;D machine working child vaccines, variant vaccines getting Warp Speed level funding. DC bastion stupidity.

the government shuts economy

-healthy people told quarantine 2 weeks

Turns survival rate virus 99.98% 

-young people barely effected. average age death 80+.

knowing this, everything still shut 1.5 years vaccine available anyone wants wants it, taken it. want said want saying everyone take whether want say ""herd immunity"" people already virus also told take vaccine. even testing people trying make vaccine mandatory said keep borders shut 80% taken it. Currently time goal met, goalposts saying vaccine stop transmission virus, everyone still take anyway someone please help me, feel like I'm going crazy. 

I remember CDC admitted COVID spread aerosol transmission, essentially determined masks really help stop spread. taped n95 masks really lot stop. 

Am crazy thing? keep forgetting people like exist Reddit. adults talking really concern you. People like cease existing 😩 gaslighting people different opinion you.

Disagreeing someone ""gaslighting."" ""opinion."" transmission virus. 

You're projecting lot personal feelings onto comment. make logical points, nothing emotional appeal. “safe” you? Zero COVID? happening buddy. Try remember lived life 2019 personal risk calculations.

This preposterous, baiting argument. trying put words mouth, triggered, angry comment barely bothered read. 

It's quite interesting accounts commenting response massive commenters sub, post citations, opinion. conversation. encourage anyone reading comments, check post history people attempting create arguments.  Yup, tested positive antibodies good bit well. Wife tested positive even higher amount, Moderna shots later mine. ATL area fully vaccinated still wear mask considering third shot soon. believe things going get worse. Freedom: ability choose, individual, whether wear mask get vaccine.

Responsibility: Acknowledging risks stepping outside safety home, taking initiative protect yourself, realizing isn’t people’s responsibility protect you. hesitant take EUA shown quotations FDA ""sprinted"" ""pressure"" fully approve, throw additional roadblock?

Of course does. removes substantial obstacle mandating vaccines military, govt workers, healthcare workers, even private companies, vaccine longer considered “experimental”. You’re never going convince cohort thinks rushed. truck driver should’ve thrown reverse finished job Supposedly we're finding long covid might actually activation mono triggered covid. decision mask vaccinated falls individual rather state, county, city…lol seems pretty clear He's dumb all, knows exactly he's doing.

He's gearing run president firing base telling want hear. He's playing strongman standing Federal Government case means he's helping perpetuate spread Covid.

His actions inflict pain suffering state Covid hot spot. got kn95 way. think cloth masks cut setting. worry bringing home little boy 2.

Thank post. seen VA dashboard -- looks like shape Indiana dashboard (click Breakthrough far right: anyone explain two states (*edit: Indiana VA) outliers places like LA county, Israel, Spain, Provincetown? thousands breakthrough cases recent weeks, VA closer 100? around 8M people state...am reading something incorrectly VA dashboard (I realize Indiana dashboard cases per 100K). VA nearly identical curves (in shape count) cases time google it. :(

Scary kids without pre-existing conditions. Limiting government mandating something isn’t overreach. It’s literally opposite. beyond ridiculous. It’s like he’s working virus.

Doing nothing would beneficial active effort belittle curbing virus. look far enough think provide citations. spam people links like thread do. Covid very, small threat children. I'm sure citing numbers total death counts we're talking kids. That's disingenuous, that's ignoring facts, that's acting emotionally - like said - projecting trauma fear onto kids. Honestly would like understand paragraph means bottom line that, contrast variants, vaccinated people, even get sick, got infected shed virus similar levels unvaccinated people got infected,"" Dr. Walter Orenstein, heads Emory Vaccine Center viewed documents, told CNN. you’re concerned wear mask 12 get vaccine. Nobody saying can’t voluntarily take precautions. That's one thing I'm nervous about. insurance company come way? show records surely right? Boosters way Sry sry *Texas joke* comment?!?!?!  looks like reading comprehension's thing? Texas fund remote. district set cancel summer due state deciding fund it. Covid aside, districts remote learning successful many wanted continue it. ""Keep virus alive. Spread it. Help mutate."" Plus even flu season last year.  IKR one isn’t feeling sympathy - he’s imply trying help hyper focus worst possible scenario that’s extremely rare. You’re taking insult defending fear clearly controls you.

Breath America Unvaccinated go work K-Mart know violence answer, anyone else feel urge beat shit guy? Florida experienced similar spike last summer since right time year everyone stays inside runs AC. I'm wondering north see similar spike winter start running heat staying indoors.
I think likely, hopefully less dramatic since higher vaccination rates north.  Oof.  120 vaccinated hospitalized 180 non vaccinated yeah that’s good needs addressed mr fauci Private businesses…..

I've long blocked log FB cat gifs memes. It’s rolling average 7 deaths per day. That’s hardly anything concerned over. point make situation bad possible. know they're losing voter base Covid; preventing cities schools issuing mask mandates, expose people Covid ordinarily would careful (and part voter base), thus ensuing mass casualties sides political spectrum. strictly political calculation.

“Yeah, that’s there’s always backup surgeon operating room.” 
ಠ_ಠ Well hope refrigerated trucks body bags going need it. Again. much higher mortality rate *in adults.* 

It’s level “a bad flu season” children 12. know, doesn’t feel like “no problem” you’re thinking kids. it’s true. Israel already recommending immune compromised kids 12 get vaccinated believe. Part problem getting vaccines fast enough wanted U.S. moralizing people would get jumping line... come find out, half country want anyway. think could figured lot sooner less moralizing sitting around waiting people show December February. U.K. kind going one-shot route first reaching volume, worrying second doses.

Knowing there'd many people unwilling vaccinated would helpful information lot sooner. also would single dose people level protection news rough 2nd shot could would taken longer get out.

So whole ""less honest people going start getting one anyway"" sounds like ""people would like live longer trust (RIGHTFULLY SO) veracity information given out"", especially leans towards, ""It's fine, everything great here, time get back office/restaurant/mass transit/school, etc. asap resume normal life!""

Btw, mean come across confrontational it, think agree everything, honestly can't begrudge anyone whatever takes get third shot point, especially vaxxed January high risk category.  Keep mind already state media! feel spread you? people seem think get vaccinated, decision affects them. thinking broader protecting others? Good news. I'm glad NY north east seemingly ok...for now.

Aren’t still resilient symptoms?

What probably spread existing variants far wide communities unvaccinated, using schools main nexus transmission. Imagine someone political power actually caring citizens. Vaccines still easiest answer.

There's tougher answer people going face that's natural immunity. idea guys think ""normal"" be? Delta rising I'm dejected [From Data July 4 outbreak Cape Cod, Massachusetts, appears led CDC Director Rochelle Walensky earlier week recommend fully vaccinated people wear mask indoors public spaces live areas spread virus currently ""substantial"" outbreak, vaccinated unvaccinated people nearly amount virus recovered test samples, indicating vaccinated people contagious unvaccinated people comes delta previous strains, vaccinated people became infected coronavirus much lower levels virus, meaning less may changed.

People aren’t getting vaccinated. Hospitals overwhelmed. still takes 3 hours get covid test areas state. 

Vaccines alone stop Delta wildfire Arkansas. taking 6 weeks people fully vaccinated. fully vaccinated people able infect others Delta variant. 

Arkansas needs vaccines + masks minimum, K-12 schools. Right now, mask mandates schools still illegal. point people choose testing rather vaccination testing costs deducted paychecks. go zombie apocalypse stage already? years, although would still recommend it, it’s super exhausting.

Of exactly? people US? number people exposed/ Infected? one states aware local quirks make sheltered. Political how? Thanks info I'm saying purely academic perspective...

Doing GOP one fastest ways theory ensure revolution. Particularly Marxist one written paper. 

Marxism formed wake excesses Victorian-era Industrial Revolution. know, workhouses, indigent families afford medicine, orphanages filled brim unwanted, uncared children, out-of-touch wealthy elites... 

You know, stuff Dickens wrote two contemporaries, saw stuff, likely knew influenced other. 

Dickensian meant pejorative, aspiration.

And sounds like GOP aiming for. per *Communist Manifesto* *Das Kapital*, that's asking revolution. well aware, GOP exactly savvy Marxism Marx actually said, I'm sure they're educated Dickens writers time... Post-vaccination risk level things live time already shame people failing cower from. big threat unvaxxed people, they're GOING catch spread it, masks no. Masks slow long takes spread it, we've (or shot) spread much lower level. Life involves risk. I'm spending entire life covering face public people demanding zero risk covid, contrary treat risks life.  know still allow stadiums filled 40K daily? Ok cool thanks info guise fucked. wife got another argument today wearing masks public - even though fully vaccinated - protect young school-age kids. finally confided today stubborn wearing mask due shit put teacher rural school district. hoping closer normal school year shot hell thanks numerous asshats cannot bothered get vaccinated.

However I’m saying even 60% 70% fully vaccinated won’t enough it’ll wild fire unvaccinated partially vaccinated. Delta target 30-40% population worse original 100% population healthcare system. Yes. support masks indoors schools rise delta variant per AAP guidelines reason lower rednecks economically weaker states even *dumber*. makes shit look worse, texas look better. indirect proof. Infect cells makes mRNA virus (including available mRNA!) integrated host genome, whereas running experiment HBV leads detectable virus integration.

Do evidence integration random mRNAs host genome Obviously mods agreed took post down.

You may want check assumption. Seriously. 

I'm alarmed lack criticism towards CDC's messaging lately. absolutely stoking antivaxx rhetoric. 

I trust CDC followed data guidelines throughout pandemic, obvious everyone recent messaging confusing people seeding doubt vaccine efficacy. provaxxers antivaxxers another article Jessica DuPreez, fiance Michael Freedy, Las Vegas casino worker, ""wanted wait one year release (of vaccine) see effects people had, never intention get it."" 

Doesn't sound like anti-vaxxer. Sounds like casualty disinformation war waged. pro-fetus/ pro woman's womb/ pro controlling woman. gave us sorts shit. Anthrax, smallpox, malaria drugs little 3 month deployment. I'm baffled covid shot mandatory. Based agree sir indeed dolt. there's nothing add since said needed said, simply emphasize still dolt - reading this, likely long time I'm expecting see. differences timing depending live. got shot gonna okay. things could get interesting you. Exactly this. I'm Texan choice want leave home 20 years Abbott destroying goodwill Texas received regard state tax , looser business restrictionsl, good cost living. Also economy good moving Energy sector. power grid, Covid, voting rights going set us back 20 years. Fuckkk man living Texas gets worst day. already work people don’t wear masks unvaccinated. recommending in-person schools mitigation in-person schools costs. may said previous comment see it. 
The recommendation telling states, open schools full time social distancing masking indoors outdoors. Nothing changed vaccines answer, really - Delta, somewhat higher rates vaccination required, that's all. US solid start vaccination campaign slowed much. However, numbers ticking back past days, people hesitating realize choices really Delta vaccine long term. 

It sucks vaccine campaign fast enough make reimplementing mask mandate unnecessary. mandate go away enough people immune, even though that's yet. 0 reason think permanent masks. completely abandon time yourself. leaked CDC presentation literally says vaccines reduce risk hospitalisation death 25 fold. headline. \*Sentences thousands death, far norm Texas. Comedy? Wow consider surprised 😮 Must. Spread. More. absolutely caused wobbles reliable weekly trend. almost ALWAYS goes weekend, almost ALWAYS goes midweek. Newspapers taken advantage directions, writing ""EVERYTHING FINE COVID OVER"" articles weekend drops form part overall rise, papers currently writing scary sounding articles 2 days cases going saw yesterday. BS intended confound following stats closely enough see weekly patterns. calculation unvaccinated person? Again, won’t see much difference numbers unless calculate relative risk absolute risk. think Pfizer going sell loss?  Yes. article says lots infections right - trying safely manage covid patients expose non Covid patients part challenge risks pediatric patients. Might well close em Shocker Sure, yes linked press release easier understand many people see they've submitted data peer review.

Now, question asking infected severity infection limiting disease? end goal every vaccine developed, preventing infections not. seem delusion locking country getting virus zero keep zero. there's enough immunity keep spreading, spread reintroduced. Unless somehow entirety world US packed slums Brazil India mountain Afghanistan war torn displaced populations middle east simultaneously reduce virus zero, starts spreading again. admitted vaccination enough stop it, aware said true.

Look, get it. Covid sucks want go away. want live world exists. willing ANYTHING make go away.

But wishing make happen. extreme measures willing go try eradicate wipe Earth, it'll back greet us take away extreme measures. Sometimes life sucks things want happen happen. Covid's one things. genie going back bottle. Covid lives us now. Yeah odds contracting covid sans vaccines still relatively low people. take account odds contracting covid greatly reduced vaccines. emphasis breakthrough viral loads always misguided. always possible (even based previous studies) breakthrough cases could spread virus it’s likely. even worst cases scenario loved ones vaccinated it’s unlikely anyone experience severe case covid. pretty fucking obvious GOP going opposite left. left like start going balls wall GOP talking points shift GOP right thing. r/publicfreakout lit  living. need aggressive mandating vaccines. me, would vaccine passports school mandates. 

Beyond that, vaccine protection doesn’t last forever virus continues mutate. can’t give “done it”. 

That’s works never has. People previous plagues challenging times don’t get give up. 

By means need to, pretend it’s going go away done I’m sorry take measures. Got them! 
I've still avoided indoor dining. go inside anywhere, I'm masked up. masking behavior changed. certainly mind wearing one.  Best luck! preview Delta may here, elsewhere: relevant bit: ""More 150 children died Covid-19 week July 12 alone, said, half recent deaths involving younger 5...More 800 children Indonesia age 18 died virus since pandemic began, Dr. Aman said, majority deaths occurred past month.""

In words, Delta killing children alarming rates. Meanwhile, school transportation related crashes, per NHTSA--these include involved parties, children, pedestrian hit schoolbus, person hit bus, etc: looking maybe 100-150 fatalities year, 281 school-age children died school-transportation-related-crashes 2007 2016. average somewhere 30 year. Wanna know many kids died COVID US since pandemic began? Somewhere 520 far. 

Oh, southern states leading COVID scoreboard right reporting record numbers pediatric hospitalizations COVID seen point previously pandemic. recap, case bad math, we've shown evidence supports notion Delta hospitalizing killing children rates higher previous strains COVID, school-aged children die way school vehicle-related accidents rate less 30 year, course pandemic, children United States dying rate 300ish year, rate looking likely increase dangerous Delta variant running unchecked fall school semester rapidly approaching safety measures place. COVID = 10x deadly traffic accidents en route school, Delta, proving thus far unquantifiably dangerous previous strains were, particular children. much worse yet seen. That’s bold strategy Cotton let’s see works party small government? watch day watches evenings. sleeps sleep sleep work (or staying 3am that’s way get free time). combine highly virulent variant people refusing get vaccinated issues. wonder what's common factor States? policymakers want change minds, change calculations raising costs remaining unvaccinated, benefits getting vaccinated both. can’t that, won’t, vaccination effort likely remain stuck — least variant wreaks sufficient carnage change ultimately fall issue. Persuasion demonstrated highly ineffective, fact attempt persuasion seems cause individuals become set thinking, costing hundreds thousands lives. 

If behavior change, behavior must acted upon change, requires incentives punishments. There's talk recently $100 checks getting vaccinated. lotteries. think country continue seek generate many carrots possible generate incentive get vaccinated. 

But also need stick. companies, especially healthcare, requiring proof full vaccination vaccinated employment. I'm entirely favor that. We're also looking mandate Federal workers possible military requirement well. Fantastic. would still like benefits functioning society, must contribute safety society form responsible personal behavior, includes 1) spreading disease), 2) costing us valuable healthcare resources, 3) incubator variants. 

**We need carrot stick thinking stop wasting time persuasion**. can't persuade someone thinks microchips injections sees death toll thinks lie get medical information Facebook political pundits. cannot relied upon rational.  people gone cuckoo !!! 

even animals go die actively ! Cloth masks ok original COVID delta apparently 1000x viral load spreads easily chickenpox r8 cloth mask even going anywhere near effective now? Shouldn’t pushing higher quality masking? Excellent. say isn’t good sign study included 4,000 delta cases done UK. 

The UK completely different timetable people received second dose versus US Israel. think 8 weeks dose 1 2. 

There seems evidence larger gap doses provides longer lasting immune response. Abhorrent. Texas ghastly image could happen entire country people don’t wise up. hope tool someday realizes they’ve done. Check public library free access. may able get virtual library card online current member. comment -1 already. look good almost half new hospitalizations vaccinated, wish people would explain they're downvoting it. numbers real. 🤷‍♀️ someone vaccinated still vulnerable family members something I'm following closely. Thanks pointing out! he's going brought murder reckless endangerment charges people die result this, right? Right.....? Also, try fucking sue this.

Pretty sure local mask madates jurisdictions municipal jurisdiction. executive order shit.  Climate change working Stupidest thing heard since ""It could tourists."" wrong sub. called antivaxxer saying hide fact vaccine slightly less effective Delta. Cold, course.  
Flu everyone get vaccinated vaccine varies efficacy year-to-year kinda accept risk.  
Covid killed 600K Americans thus far. tally CDC's flu deaths past *decade* get 359K. Covid vaccines *way* effective flu vaccines usually are. 
so no, okay disease killed almost twice amount people one year flu killed decade *and* free super-effective vaccine. post makes political. Yet don’t ability see it. say everything bigger Texas .... even idiots need brace Isreali data accurate, boosting vulnerable populations now. know CDC Public Health officials worried messaging, obvious boosters MRNA Gen 1 vaccines needed every 6 months. Arkansas pediatric hospital reporting record admissions kids 12 kids without underlying issues. numbers enormous worse ever been. seems worse, clear much worse? communities vaccinated Arkansas Indonesia, make better? IDK. Thanks random unverified Twitter account!  R Baboon... Certainly important point, peoples’ nature focus negatives positives (myself included), glossed over. 
The mRNA vaccines remain amazing accomplishment much important tool kit combat disease. 

The concern report stems things. 
Delta cases much higher viral loads - know means. 
Until recent events, assumed interaction vaccinated individuals incredibly safe presented minimal risk infection one parties sick @ time interaction - changed (we need consider symptomatic asymptomatic). 
With easily Delta spreads sky high R0 value, legitimately vulnerable population - speak specifically children - even increased risk. 

We want shit end: 
 - deaths  
 - hospitalizations  
 - sickness  
 - cases  

Delta shifted varying levels. 
Arguably standpoint need best eliminate cases, Delta makes hard do. 
Simply put, like many others point out, continued wave wave infections bring new variants biggest threat ending this. 
We simply must stop virus many variants continuing chance evolve. Florida needs lock point. Masks enough PM Aus pretty much continuously gaslit entire population last several years harsh lockdown VIC broke lot people.

I think theres general defeated feeling amongst portion population, probably ones follow along COVID news subreddits.

The rest population would seem cease care COVID soon cases hit zero. Everything individual choice right now. cloth mask wrong choice. promise they're listening matter say. can't even convince unvaccinated friends massachusetts get poked, even without dick it. data Delta reinfections yet. video gives good breakdown current literature may apply immunity binary immune/not immune state. Based prior infection already type immunity, various factors, may specific you, determine degree immunity.

That said, current understanding previously infected individuals, received least one dose vaccine likely well protected known variants coincidence high percentage states rank bottom terms quality/prevalence education amongst populace. Seriously, isn’t reckless endangerment? Sometimes wonder Texas politicians want citizens die much possible. CDC Update: B.1.617.2 ''now transmissible Common Cold infectious Chicken Pox''

Vaccine Not: Mask Good Hygiene America much pro life understand point, don’t know future. virus could mutate something weaker, better vaccine could come along. Children aren’t even vaccinated yet. question give become fatalistic personal one. me, it’s early give mitigation, it’s still waiting game. even TVA could stop them. think everyone, mean everyone, exhausted trying enforce mask mandates. sure you’re getting downvoted. dozens articles say exact thing. 

IIRC, scientists still don’t know Spanish flu disappeared. China still vaccinating 10-20 million doses daily, they'll ahead US soon terms shots. Although right cannot compare natural immunity US maybe 25-30% population already caught virus.

Still looks like China pace finish vaccinating bulk population fall, starting fall start giving boosters, either third dose inactivated shots, use mRNA shots booster. India absolute shitshow talking help politically? think mitigation policies widely popular. anything, could argue rescinding fairly soon vaccinations started may somewhat political motivated many people like want believe over. hardcore pro-mitigation people small percent, many accept mitigation efforts due unique situation even though personally wish things pre pandemic. still worse education performance. United States

2020 Motor Vehicle Deaths: 38,680 people

Covid Deaths: 628,513 people Wouldn’t easier create cure? News viewers definitely contribute people unvaccinated.

Sure. according link make said wasn’t case. pointing weren’t applying percentages populations. math problem. worries. reactive attitude reason Covid hit western countries much harder eastern ones behaved proactively. assured play catch-up approach. instance: nothing institution science proclaims cannot act *as if* COVID airborne study done demonstrate is. idea one learn things taking *pre*caution disastrous public health. keeps dropping. week ago 99%. 95%. mid 80 70%.

Because end day, die variant? get vaccine, choice.

And I'm willing put good money would pool people vaccinated, vote majoritarly republican.

They literally killing voters. That's good start. Majesty needs peel $5 billion $48+ billion fortune (which really belongs people Thailand anyway), buy remaining vaccine needed, rescue businesspeople tourism sector plus anyone else plunged poverty. good king protect loyal subjects? sad  customers well?
Fucking sick bs,and caving whiners.
They shop somewhere,and time vaxxed,and sensible people start ""asking speak manager"" Sadly hope alone nothing.

Keep mask distancing, whatever Texas Governors says, can't forbid individuals masking.

There needs breakthrough treatments. IMO. remember seeing fair amount older people, hit bars, spent day hitting shops wandering around. girlfriend idea like there, took teenage daughters day. experience none us forget, heh work 2 girls going healthcare field refuse get vaccine even said use degree allowed work without one. go back college next month hate say kinda expect come back work us. One church camp couple weeks ago working got call saying might exposed. worked 2 days called sick yesterday. refuses go doctor "" say covid anytime anyone gets sick covid"" getting vaccine next week even though wanted wait. many people worry about. Abbott anti-intellectual many republicans seem love. “Our stand Americans,” wrote Roman. “They thank us later.”

 think important part article. Armchair patriots take upon protect people government. Government officials, is, elected general vote people represent populace, appointed elected officials, put regulations place protect populace dangers, like bad working conditions, poisoning environment, food poisoning due unsanitary restaurants, communicable diseases, etc.

 restaurant owner tilting windmills incredibly misguided reaction regulation regulations designed keep people safe. Honestly, person likes regulations, restaurant business ton health safety requirements involved running restaurant. consider public mask mandates form hygiene theater. Everyone wearing masks Walmart gives appearance government something pandemic, anything solve primary driver infections, private social gatherings. people thought thousands years one gets sleep? No, vaccinated people still transmit refuse masks still antimaskers still responsible least transmission. could even operate bridge different unvaccinated communities.

If anyone blame U.S. government chickenshit punish misinformation letting fester. admit new administration came power behind 8 ball continue make bad calls means try carrot stick. CDC never said did, early. delta every needs go back part. 

We need vaccine mandates need mask mandates hit herd immunity vaccination rates. chip get things dialed back fall potential worse last year. (My state already ahead last summer infections deaths per day despite 49% vaccination rate). 

We point fingers still part. knew waves infection thing beginning. like MLM. bunch people sign like crazy beginning. left basically one sell anymore everyone moves new MLM trying get early We’re long past full ICUs. Hutchinson waited hospitals unable get necessary staff take care additional patients. tool. There’s never bigger “we micromanage freedom life” types  Love it. Thank you.  comparing CFR Delta highly vaccinated population CFR Alpha much less vaccinated population. scientists analyzed variant found that, controlling age/health/vaccine status, Delta severe. I'm sure random guy internet looked two numbers jumped conclusion smarter knowledgeable qualified analyze are. flagged misinformation, absolutely nothing vaccines paper. don’t think there’s way vaccines retrotranscribe doesn’t permit overt lie title. People like little children. can't see it, can't see them. Texas Florida, making Democrats job midterms easier death! CDC's guidance changing virus changing, get data every day. Still, messaging last year less impressive. previous administration's attempts cripple excuses much. Eh, got J&amp;J concerned. It’s easy get swept news cycle think things falling apart, careful reading news shows really surge driven unvaccinated. 

Sure, vaccinated getting sick spreading before, hospitals filling vaccinated individuals. Getting minor flu doesn’t worry me, dying does, far hasn’t ton evidence delta carries significant risk vaccinated, significant risk spreading/showing symptoms. really hate see sucks know solution be. come extreme measures eventually keeps going way. Strikes medical workers such.

If things continue like this, healthcare workers quit? reach breaking point. Kill Constituents 101 Man. Think peripheral deaths going happen economic destabilization, canceling treatment/surgeries diseases, etc. I'm probably side worrying sane people holy crap. see get without severe pain level we've never seen before. Yeah read slides it’s pretty clear vaccines effective they’ve always real world. It’s even really clear they’re less effective Delta, there’s Delta circulating. WaPo whole presentation it’s really doomsday scenario media portraying as. Get vaccinated you’re not, wear mask hot spots cases go back down. Individual risk relatively healthy vaccinated people remains low. 

We’re going cycle variants outbreaks years. Vaccines free, safe, effective. Get one, mask current local infections indicate masking. Otherwise, get lives. Feeling hopeless ever. least start/middle light end tunnel. vaccines answer. updated progress gave us hope. what? There’s nothing. Mask rest lives?? don’t want that.

Yep. It’s thing puts edge compassion anti-vaxxers grossly scientifically illiterate, hatred dumbasses create new variants much easier. shithole governor shithole state tight quarters lots lots kids snotty faces grubby hands going epic breeding ground COVID variants. kids typically able resist disease variants prove even deadly. get second shot exposed cousin? entire population offered year. enough Pfizer Moderna coming vax entire population.

Yes stay locked away forever. Finally someone gets it. Torino, northwest. Currently one ""green"" regions according ECDC good article info most. 

Record pediatric admissions July - Covid, Covid Covid related illnesses add stress. Half kids ICU age 12, vaccinated kids. kids underlying health conditions. Article says things definitely different delta admissions. legislature may undo law cities schools cannot require mask mandates. nursing shortage. 

Concerning. This. would interesting see mortality rate plus rate sever outcomes result this. map direct indirect cost/losses. picture literally red Florida top pro covid anti life policies since start. Never actual lockdown /shutdown, immediately banned cities enforcing attempt, banned attempts mandate masks vaccines months ago, banned even asking vaccination status

The local governments starting rebel though, seeing we're surpass 2020 peak hospitalization numbers would think school boards people education(admin) tend lean liberal. live extremely red board quite liberal. Or, know… everywhere don’t CREATE new hotspots? What's next, banning seat belts? Banning sprinklers fire alarms large buildings? Banning restaurant health inspectors?

What bunch dunces. imagine history say this? ""In middle pandemic, state governments spent time resources banning efforts reduced severity pandemic.""

Texas backwards. can't imagine state pro-power outage pro-pandemic. That’s fear. It’s called zoonosis did. low. get symptoms, they’ll milder less dangerous would hadn’t gotten vaccinated. That’s really bottom line. Less sickness, less danger. don’t think person right make choice themselves. I’m asking question Abott idiot. “force” things time. seatbelts, vaccinations. cities Texas can’t even walk around barefoot, somehow putting masks dealing line? act like booster shot?

It would give acquired immunity. good idea intentionally though. Yes, everyone likely infected somepoint. virus isn’t going away. 

There’s good chance you’ll never even know got infected, way. Infection=/= disease. Yeah 🙃 know vax rate area. everything can.  Unknowns =/= misinformation. One thing clear general public cannot handle direction based unknowns, safest option. Scientists often communicate 'better safe sorry' perspective, means insight gained ongoing research, safety recommendations become obsolete. People get upset say, ""SEE TOLD SAFETY REQUIREMENTS NEEDED!"" *didn't* *know* made safety standards. neither you! simply best avoid worst possible outcomes. ""Do harm"" often credo, even fault.

Now mean CDC (or WHO, etc.) gotten everything right? No. opinion mask recommendations never changed (many heathcare professionals thought thing: anti-vax, viral mutation vaccinated individuals mumbo-jumbo goes window can't spread body (vaccinated un-vaccinated) kills it, mutations matter anymore.

But end day, see medical institutions recommend *least risky* practices rather say, ""we think probably ok."" one time say SURPRISE ""ok"", killed bunch people lax recommendations. former conservative, find understand today's conservatives lens Frank Wilhoit's quote:

""Conservatism consists exactly one proposition, wit: must in-groups law protects bind, alongside out-groups law binds protect."" worry! governor told us he's going anything it. 😊 Historically, pandemics tend last 2-3 years. Wikipedia gives [27 month 1918 flu pandemic. [1889–1890 (probably similar there's reason believe actually caused coronavirus, flu originally took place October 1889 December 1890, recurrences March June 1891, November 1891 June 1892, winter 1893–1894, early 1895.

(Sound familiar?)

A serious vaccination effort (which means vaccinating *everyone* possible, people 12 people feel like it) way end pandemic faster (other good enough containment never becomes pandemic first place, we've long past failed that). first pandemic medical technology good enough vaccination even option. unvaccinated people mostly “ Fox News Viewers.” isn’t actually reality

It isn't? link says says 40% 60% population getting vaccinated. Sure, smaller populations may resistant percentage (although link says that's changing rapidly), still outnumber white people refusing. also removed safeguards. number people wearing masks social distancing like closing porthole Titanic. helps still 40ft gash water pouring in. Even delta? Like original virus June 2020, chances naturally immune rn  Getting vaccine masking stop spread.

If noticed, said still catch virus place many unvaccinated people. place high vaccination masking rates, much spread, even Delta variant.

What say, also true, vaccinated, even catch Delta variant, 33 times less likely end hospital someone get vaccinated. everyone immunity vaccination infection put major brakes much spread, extremely high levels protection serious disease. endemic disease circulates like flu live it. Eradication always pipe dream.  Wtf wrong people?? science speaks itself! he’s basically committing negligence homicide putting nurses doctors blue towns serious risk. need stage walkout. madness. Breakthroughs happening *well Delta.* It’s new. job isnt ‘control narrative’. wasn’t ‘leaked’. Restrictions lifted many places US, Vax folks could ba carriers, kids getting exposed now, whether variant worse. end day, kids still pay price. term “Spreadneck” recently brought attention…, Maybe read article. personally? I'd rather go though like wearing mask means need cautious alert. feeling want I'm trying focus enjoying something. Like yeah people *kinda* coming back lot comes feeling ""must"" go out, four months road drive gonna enough cover gap people like me? glad left mess state. beautiful pockets state amazing people miss governor many people living state fine masses dying long they're political team wins.  care scared not. want facts.  saying vaccine COVID lead cognitive defects? saying COVID paper supports absolutely correct read initial response ambiguous especially deleted comment. 

Again misunderstood comment bad apologies harsh-not fan spreading misinformation like vaccines cause cognitive defecits assumed worst.  gonna listen pillow guy? gawd feel parents kids wonder why… I'm sure want third jab Delta specific vaccine boosters developed. get delta strain specific vaccines clock reset vaccinated people. Check county CDC site, see ranked transmission. good dog weeks now, assumed delta variant already (in USA), and, since daily numbers rising, interpreted evidence vaccines offered sufficient protection delta variant. assumed delta variant spread rapidly throughout India entire population mostly unvaccinated; UK, thought spreading population still received one dose two-dose vaccine. past week seen sudden increase cases within highly vaccinated counties. So, perspective least, seem like CDC lagged far behind terms recent change guidance. However, could wrong... possible taken ""wait-and-see"" approach, despite aware alarming evidence. also imagine strategy publicly modifying guidance (for instance, imagine many, many people would taken change guidance seriously daily numbers still low; numbers suddenly increasing, perhaps messaging would believable). really knows, though? really wonder point is. They're prohibiting local governments imposing public health measures protect citizens?? makes zero sense, lot last 18 months made sense. worry, one twenty children Arkansas even insurance. Holy caps lock think going change anyone's opinion unfortunately.  challenged courts? can’t imagine would stand, given concept freedom association. know necessarily constitution, generally protected classes fall category. think hard time making argument vaccinated medical condition requires reasonable accommodation. And, reasonable accommodation would shop give store order credit card information conduct business distance outside pickup. 

And restaurant give takeout.

And also given almost stores would accommodate non-vaccinated person someway without letting store. depends, Universal Orlando? Maybe bit iffy. knew Disney would doubts Universal. Abbott? No. getting hit hard party mask mandate last year.  Maybe dick answer. 

… didn’t come right. Please go grandfathers funeral talked daughter vacationing FL. rest country also reads. Free real estate, I'll pee pants. Utah saw 1100 cases yesterday. highest since Feb think, almost double seeing time last year. feel bad kids people can't get vaccine, theres part thats ready sit back watch trainwreck doubt either things true, hard draw conclusions data without knowing hospitalized.

I agree, frustrating without context.  Lol Alabama apparently top area coronavirus information needed gleaned vaccines what? husband wasn’t gasping breath front face then? It’s effecting now? Oopsy, bad?? Perhaps phrasing made see red. hope husband lives, hope people infected live. Get fucking vaccine.  Anti vaxx trash: can't get decent jobs anymore! like Holocaust!!!! point responsible people revolt stop supporting assholes actively destroying community country?

I vote anyone calling mandatory vaccines severe restrictions unvaccinated (as in, go grocery drug store - that’s it). probably depends doing. Going crowded indoor wedding reception right delta cloth mask probably effective child’s teddy bear protecting monsters.

The better advice would send bride groom gift card stay fuck home know shocking everyone lives mom basement seen sun inn18 months. therapists using covid keep patients long term go rehab 21 day stays. There’s much medical healthcare fraud covid blessing dodgy therapists. *was really getting downvoted tho?*

^*really?*^^*really?*^^^*really?*

*Because* ^*of* ^^*phrasing?* 😞 ""Mask up"" psychology worked? I’m anti vaxer, point I’m fully loosing hope vaccines have.

A close person last week went event vaccinated people allowed. 9 persons total. One person COVID far it’s confirmed 6 people event got it. 3 haven’t tested. Again, vaccinated half got virus.

This person met early week. got COVID wife also it. We’re vaccinated. I’m tired this. barely afford live Texas, neighbors leaders could give shit one health safety. Sure wish could afford live somewhere like NY CA. entire family vaccinated two still vulnerable. Take snarky comments elsewhere. equal representation/information, TX 24th nation deaths per million. Hardly massacre.

And really, isnt going much effect, even called mandates, large number population would ignore them. mostly posturing governor. almost comical seeing politicians, really knows better, rush kill voters. Apologies!!! absolutely correct quick judge. Florida probably needs stay course focus expanding maintaining healthcare capacity. people need follow mask mandate aren’t going follow one. lockdown buy time, time what? isn’t like unvaccinated Floridians flocking get vaxxed need buy weeks time immunity kick in. mitigation measures kicking inevitable weeks road. Cool man - stay safe enjoy life fullest extent safely possible so! Universal Basic Income could take away, make vaccinations prerequisite. Really there's bunch stuff could tie system make people things get free basic living money. held liable ensuing deaths long term covid effects? Still better CDC does. CDC remove mask mandate May confidently? 😡

You can’t look graph make decisions. Take sociology account 🤬  Yep. *12 year old* daughter fully vaccinated. worries. see deleted comment played conclusions. I’m sorry grandpa. 

It’s decision whether want go, I’m sure nobody would fault answer news Delta past 2-3 weeks. 

I’d recommend decide go, wear mask get tested get home.  Oppress harder daddy! early variants. whole presentation CDC struggling messaging communicate ""just transmit vaccinated mean vaccine pointless"" -- also communicate vaccinated making higher % hospitalized cases good thing. Ideally would 100% cases unvaccinated population. expect stay office none voters alive? Good thing whole charade illegal. would like mandating stores can't ""no shirt, shoes, service"" policies. I'll take downvotes cancel Broadway shows thing gets control. Neither vaccinations masks 100%. Continuing public gatherings/events sending mixed message. sounds like absolutely deserve shame. sure defending actions considering outcome.  think we're going eradicate it? previous plagues people ""give up."" risk considerably low, willing accept risk get life eradication point seem viable path forward proposed. 

The Spanish flu instance still circulating form, developed natural resistance ""giving up."" I'm glad barricading indoors socially isolating since 1916.  believe called bribery, perfectly normal something supposed good you. Makes complete sense. Low good right? /s  elderly heavily vaccinated. I’m also opinion Gottlieb close right assumption. also think Delta R8 around chickenpox level infectious infecting huge amount people LESS severe original strains. remains seen idea many actually getting infected compared hospitalized hard tell. I’m fact Delta infectious burn nearly entire population quickly. could good thing end indeed much less severe. mean get that, adults sleep really isn’t solution cannot possibly pack sleep truly educating kid “abandoning time yourself.” 

It’s real solution acting like doesn’t help situation. 

I married woman. don’t ever plan kids even understand isn’t healthy child parents. Even someone without kids don’t want families kids live like this. need public education system people trust protect children. main difference people take medicine smoke mostly danger themselves. Reckless driver csn potentially kill people. anti-vaxxers access safe vaccine use put everyone around danger stupidity. infect dozens people. Way move goalposts. small big government government solely ""I"" want it. seems little narcissistic part.  sickness news event, care opinion now. Objectively pro-disease. moved Bama, boy excited feel like vote never counts.  telling 1/5 people feel concerned/ill enough seek test positive supposed surprising? Israel seems data processing issues, I'm going wait re-analysis data customer requirement.

Imagine minimum wage worker trying already shitty job try enforce mask policy angry (and often armed) rednecks...

No thanks. He's God's work. ""God"", mean Darwin (blessings always Holy Name.)

Hopefully offset least damage voters' rights. agree. I'm sure need FDA CDC tell us take medication/vaccine. doctor power see data, make decision, recommend someone get booster now. Limits thee, me.

""Conservatism consists exactly one proposition, wit: must in-groups law protects bind, alongside out-groups law binds protect."" Read footnotes data.

The cause hospitalization Post-vaccination infection hospitalization defined post-vaccination case hospital admit date day first positive COVID test date; hospitalizations verified COVID-associated.

Now obviously *may* people fact hospitalized COVID. could also case none hospitalized COVID. doubt either things true, hard draw conclusions data without knowing hospitalized.  Next question 7, comorbidities. COVID! almost moved Florida 9 years ago teach there. can’t believe different experience COVID would done that. Stay safe Floridians. Check ""Kissing Coronavirus"" debut can't prevent individuals masking no, hardly matters one else around masking except small minority. like entire south even North Carolina bringing back mandate. 

But makes last point even stronger correct that. REALLY need effective treatments. needs focus that. trying turn covid plague stupid people, you’d it. Power stupid, guess… masks specifically N95? too. 

So many coworkers proudly unvaccinated. It’s pitiful. limited decision hands individual. Cant limited that! Der took uuur jeeeeeerbs Right sea.  Remember Republicans would tell us big government stay local politics local governments know what's best local communities?

Republicans full shit. Texas hate Washington tells us God forbid like Austin tells us do. Let schools make choices. hate Abbott much… Republicans don’t believe limited government. perfectly fine oppressive intrusive government long control it. It’s kind like people “pro-life”… aren’t actually support life. support want almost nothing life living… desires rules. Fuck Texas Buckle up! *Laughs Holocaust* He's handicapped, right? There's way GOP backs president, ever. true vaccinated people? Might true unvaccinated people hard time believing it’s much deadly flu given vaccines? Half LA County vaccinated. saying 1 week, 5M vaccinated residents, 123 vaccinated residents went hospital REASON all? that's absurd. would thousands daily.  non-paywall data source:

http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/states-normalized.html R value estimate many people infected person passes disease to. R value 5 means sick person infect 5 people. R0 ""R naught"" value would population immunity mitigation strategies. Rt ""effective R"" value presently given current levels immunity mitigation strategies. Rt greater one, infection levels grow. Rt less one, infection levels decline.

Edited add word forgot wear reading glasses lol don’t think it’ll full April 2020 fully expect city reinstate mask mandate put restrictions bar/restaurant capacity, probably close at-the-bar service, lot places voluntarily curtail service ( like bowling alleys small music venues ) Vilifying people wary new vaccines is, 100% unwarranted. furthermore vilifying people help way convincing people wary vaccine take it, likely exact opposite effect people fence. vast majority got infected either vaccinated, received first jab recently (and many even day went clubbing). context topic point guy responded moot, based false assumption. great news, herd idiots afraid vaccine. Darwinism finest! havent asymptomatic vaxed because, delta, think could actionable rate. Fuck state.  asked it, got it. Lock rest country. x1000. exactly I’ve wondering. point say ok, we’ve done can, safe, mitigate risk, get shots! 

I know covid real jolt, move treat communicable risky infections? ever happen? feel sympathy kids, it’s rare effected badly. feel away kids dying influenza viruses? respect decision parent, don’t think taking important moments kids childhood virus might hurt right. Alabama turns blue 2022.... read due paywall. 

But thing keep mind. vaccines 100 effective. 

So population 100% unvaccinated, cases deaths among unvaccinated.

If population 100% vaccinated, cases deaths among vaccinated. 

Seems Mass. majority vaccinated. proportion vaccinated test positive bound increase. yours. fuckin moron. Lol I'm unsure downvoted. comfort level is, influences absolutely one else. would *much* rather person over-cautious. downvoted feel comfortable OP? That's toxic shit.

All collapse society coming fall believe  vaccines estimated around 70% effective preventing infection. 

Various studies find similar even better protection masks. 

Vaccines effective preventing infection, people definitely oversold it. Sadly true. I’m suburb Dallas county top 10 cases counties. Even cities counties allowed mask mandate, wouldn’t implement mandate county. Yeah...vaccination passport = vaccination record forever. people boggle mind. preventing disease? mean 10% difference vaccination rates counties voted trump vs voted Biden. literally killing conservative base point. sad people stupid?

That's smart, capacity pick orders matches demand. Often hasn't.

Indirect Protection Reducing Transmission: Ending Pandemic SARS-CoV-2  Well yeah. responding vaccinated people likely get tested asymptomatic. Yes, perhaps, since many showing symptoms I’m sure say definitively. Maybe like vaccinated people likely get tested general. Which, yeah. pro life life born yet. born practically ""pro-death"".  Elimination COVID pipe dream couldn’t happen cooperation. costs would high would vastly outstrip benefit. tons circulating diseases. one them. everyone antibodies, COVID look much different. tell people around dying? article them?

Tell hospital statistical anomaly less 3% hospitalizations vaccinated individuals. January May 2021, COVID-NET data laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations adults ≥18 years age, vaccination status known, showed &lt;3% hospitalizations occurred fully vaccinated persons. CDC conducts nationwide monitoring vaccine breakthrough cases resulting hospitalization death. sell vacuums spare time hospital shifts? There's link research paper there: think peer reviewed yet.

Here's another paper (also peer states opposite think right still know.

I fully expect Covid year bring death least 1 person aware personal life. Unvaccinated idiots cruel.

Or call murderers? also finish May. went late August June. Vaccines make people less likely become infected, turn makes vaccinated people less likely spread viruses others compared unvaccinated people less likely become infected show symptoms first place. studies suggesting Delta might possibly spread easier vaccinated people infected showing symptoms previous variants. know sound good, good put perspective considering regional vaccination Actually, read slides CDC presented says vaccines 88%effective symptomatic cases. Small government conservative RepubliQons strike again! UK ended school year ended Euros partying 1.3% tested positive delta. Scotland, school year ended weeks earlier surge ended fat fewer testing positive. 

It's impossible number infected much higher 1.3%, Europe actually test lot. recent study Germany found 60% many tests seropositives. Florida work well known theme park. fully vaccinated I’ve worn mask best ability. Tourism helping spread. Again. part problem. go ahead. Make feel better wear “two masks”. 🙄 Ok statistician someone translate this? I'm reading correctly breakthrough cases vs general public vaccine type:

Pfizer: 46% Covid Positive Despite 56% population getting Pfizer

Moderna: 38% Covid Positive 38% Receiving Moderna

Jansse: 16% Covid Positive 7% getting Janssen.

&amp;#x200B;

So Janssen worst job. Pfizer best. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Among 469 cases Massachusetts residents, 346 (74%) occurred persons fully vaccinated; these, 301 (87%) male, median age 42 years. Vaccine products received persons experiencing breakthrough infections Pfizer-BioNTech (159; 46%), Moderna (131; 38%), Janssen (56; 16%); among fully vaccinated persons Massachusetts general population, 56% received Pfizer-BioNTech, 38% received Moderna, 7% received Janssen vaccine products.**   exposed shit ton people contracted it, one lives someone severely compromised immune system. get point I'm allowed curious no? Florida, August 10, masks (yet 🤞🏻) required. Good...that keep safe! 25% cases related covid also - covid related hospitalizations/death % even lower law restricts governments ability create laws force people compliance threat fine imprisonment limiting government, limited government.

Holy shit always thought Florida Canadian territory thanks clearing lol statistic, possibly true, absolutely useless context. Mostly part left unvaccinated vaccinated spread infected Daniel Dopp? dont sell arkansas short ! I'm loop currently live country best mitigate spread without completely wrecking economy, Governor explained are, taking precautions, also forbidding municipalities anything mitigate spread? still simply political thing motives? understand virus living thing like living thing wants survive procreate? see coming feel like people always going say wait little bit longer . 12 vaccinations school starts wait booster shot see effects [insert new variant]. People deserve consistent timeline Canadian government massive problem shifting goalposts. man absolute terrorist. First all, masks, vaccinations. 

Second, don’t get vaccinated. can’t come school would pose risk others.

To cancer example, cancer contagious refused treatment, that’s choice. perfectly reasonable let come spaces would affect others. see, freedom decide affects others. It’s anything. don’t care smoke home, don’t smoke face. don’t care let 10 year old drive car property, don’t let drive public roads. don’t care don’t get vaccinated wear mask, get fuck away family. another source. Writers follow style guide. happened American politics That's justification public policy. whatever want personally.  Yeah. human mental toll awful, least protect proper PPE save anxiety. 

NBD though! /s still tons different viruses world. everything COVID. Wear N95/KN95 mask. fucking hate living Texas. me, concerned 3 kids (including 8 month old baby). think Trump piece shit happened watch, would protests streets every media outlet would screaming story 24/7. Prior delta, feel like understand sort rationale this. time, really, \*really\* like distinguishing positive cases among vaccinated individuals unvaccinated individuals, but, retrospect, see makes sense.

I know paper, stated reasoning want waste resources keeping track ""positive"" cases would generally go develop symptoms; since none vaccines confer sterilizing immunity, given many (perhaps most) vaccinated individuals would exposed virus, accumulate viral mRNA bodies, would never become ""infected"" sense would ever develop symptomatic disease.

Even besides point, though, feel like possibly PR move play, which, me, feel warranted, even prioritizing kind political strategy truth. First foremost, tabulating so-called ""breakthrough cases"" among perfectly healthy vaccinated people would make vaccines appear much less efficacious actually are, would incorrect, also dangerous, obvious reasons. Secondly, would perhaps encouraged fully vaccinated people unnecessarily self-isolate, needlessly prolonging economic pain that's wrought virus. certainly believe people encouraged endanger communities participate economy, vaccines actually confer near-perfect level protection told alpha beta variants, well original virus. quite recently, unclear quickly delta might spread among fully vaccinated; able see spread among unvaccinated partially vaccinated populations, among communities majority people fully vaccinated. ""wait-and-see"" approach might appear irresponsible, short-sighted maybe even inhumane retrospect, but, truth would never know bad get, things start getting bad. delta effectively neutralized vaccines variants concern, nobody would feeling betrayed CDC's decision keep track infections among vaccinated people, guidance dropping mask mandates vaccinated people.

Unfortunately, know delta variant spread among fully vaccinated individuals, least often enough warrant reintroducing measures like masking limiting time spent indoors among crowds.

I guess I'm trying say is, think tried advise us based information time, manner genuinely intended public's overall best interest. Even might political / PR component it, expense truth. Probably always sort balancing act like comes kind country-wide public health messaging.

(Of course, personal speculation, making actual claims CDC's intentions this).  LOL, same, getting hateful messages saying still wear mask see situation shakes out. I'm blinding trusting organization protect people last year. want company mandate it. We’ve least gone back mask mandates offices updated CDC guidelines, I’d love see become mandatory. Terrible headline. unvaccinated don’t care don’t see way. simply spin “see, vaccine doesn’t even work” Walmart, Second-Largest U.S. Employer Next Federal Government, Saves Many Staff's Lives"" Ye h shit like Missouri too. St. Louis literally sued AG masking. flickers anything flex keep power. 600,000 dead? They'd see millions beat eye that's price ""right"". metric dumb fuck, can’t believe still makes headlines. go ahead wall Texas Florida? guy probably posting Moscow amount misinformation he’s spewing.

Dude threw case studies redditor told “9/9 us got sick” 9 people. NINE. dude definitely getting 100% news Facebook. often groups stretched health care system point code black issued? 2 3 examples suffice. text beyond grave? Surely go way stories Tweet heaven.

People downvote say something want hear. said earlier year we'd wearing masks summer 2022 got downvoted it. 

When reflecting attitudes 2020, admit - times conflicted whether much alarmist. Given what's happening now, perhaps wasn't. 
I feel like conflicted feelings year ago. Except now, I've learned people won't. different opinions sometimes never changed. I'm pretty sure none stand SCOTUS even state Supreme Court challenge, clearly strategy tie legal system long enough next wave two passes. /r/excgarated Ok see saying. still need information.

Add another study found IQ drops amongst *all* Covid positive individuals (magnitude IQ drop correlated illness severity). human race got dumber. Wooh hoo!  effective prevention infection especially preventing hospitalization death. want get sick want spread it, outlier breakthrough, least I'm less likely get *very* sick. 

But I'll first line third shot/Delta variant shot. I'm turning extra protection. feel doesn’t affect personally fuck everyone else right? mildly inconvenienced mask Walmart prevent listed happening people right? could get covid worse second time , run 5k hur dee dur   Desantis mass murderer. pullout game hand..........🙌 see way spectacularly backfire Abbott GOP, large. Also worth pointing directly responsible winterizing power grid. would happened regardless, virus 🦠 would spread slower long giving enough hosts (non vaxxed) would spread People misinterpreting Cape Cod study. Nate Silver talking it, apparently math wasnt easy.

efficacy would zero everyone vaccinated got disease. Wait…. let get straight. States hate federal government intervenes state politics? state perfectly fine intervening local politics? understanding hypocrisy here? vaccine foolproof it’s much better place last fall Womp date, vaccination rates among Black Hispanic people lagged behind White people, largely due access logistical barriers well concerns safety potential side effects. such, even broad national vaccination goals achieved, groups may remain higher risk, could lead widening health disparities limit nation’s recovery Cool, saying judicially mask mandate Texas ever upheld purely political post (anymore discussion), whatever. minority Americans. They’re called republicans live different planet. literally kill admitting experts right anything. saying, gotten vaccine know risks. Let die terms delta variant, still become infected infect others vaccinated, could make virus evolve become dangerous unvaccinated? long covid?  mean getting people sick fucks economy? low potential.

What claim based on? past 2 weeks become increasingly aware easily delta spreading among fully vaccinated. takes 1-2 months long-haul symptoms develop. Even then, would take even longer identify tabulate statistics account people fully vaccinated confirmed long-term complications.

I agree probability vaccinated people developing long-covid found small original virus, well alpha beta variants. But, delta variant, believe real data that, yet.

What have, though, \*ton\* anecdotal reports fully vaccinated people losing sense taste/smell, developing chronic fatigue brain fog. evidence neurological complications typical long-covid. indeed CDC saying. reported something along lines of:

"" advantage vaccination terms transmission""

That CDC saying, incredibly powerful negative propaganda.

carpe diem.

The trolls took advantage wording add even FUD vaccine debate. Austin able before. Austin chose to.  Like, pharma paying keep going lots boosters updated vaccines? Republicans treat Covid same,just incompetent mean next one bad,she said circumstances anymore lockdiwns,or mask mandates.She old,and touch Govern. really do. psycho mask crowd beyond pathetic point. mean truly don’t know see look mirror. It’s tragic.

Let’s let rip fine tune vaccines/boosters learn live thing. anti-vax crowd pathetic mask forever crowd. worrying however think need honest move goalposts back were. time last year expectation would vaccine prevented transmission - hoping vaccine saved lives eliminated hospital surges. 

When real world data early year started coming out, pleasantly surprised got vaccinated people really transmitting virus other. amazing.

So have? Right strong vaccines go long way towards reducing mortality hospitalizations, wished. 

Now, need figure work together reduce spread increase vaccination rates avoid huge surges way updated boosters low risk infection. something comparable. 

Segregation based something cannot helped- race, and/or something hurt people/ isnt contagious- religion.

This something helped something hurt people. cannot compared. Yeah. probably need plan next vacay. actually massively important demographics stat need check into. 

I'm LGBTQ community I'm going assume lot close contact liberal vaccinated individuals many unvaccinated cases may workstaff hotels/bars/restaurants who's contact close? 

What fascinating cases study is! think issue lot vaccinated right before, single shot vaccine takes 4-6 weeks reach efficacy.

I doubt it. ""Proof vaccination"" EU corona certificate generally means ""at least 2 weeks passed since second shot"". safe wear mask everyone area fully vaccinated? school requiring everyone submit proof they’re fully vaccinated campus masks longer required, I’m sure wearing one case I’m safe since we’ll vaccinated. someone believes government able force anything will. dumb. remember joking anti vaxxers years ago thinking hilarious seeing people okay letting virus run around expect go away stupid. Members Kovid Kollaborator Klub.  assume GOP intentionally trying kill people. 
There risks fucking freedom mandating mask. It’s piece cloth helps slow spread airborne virus. isn’t complicated. GOP followers prove horrible really are. Gotta love Friday dumps refuse speed limit it’s car? smoking area? people right get vaccinated, actually forced. fired deterred though.

The worst part nobody knows fuck going conflicting information. ""Going out"" mask attempting enjoy leisure activity jibe me

If I'm ""going out"" comfortable enjoy I'll stay home.

If I'm ""getting something"" I'll mask even post-vaccine.

I know worse furlough, people similar thought might be. Agree.   end though? 2020 took precautions limit hospital capacity wait vaccine. vaccine freely available people refusing get it.

So perspective hear ""you need mask up, this, whatever limit spread"" thinking like yours. what? Wear mask, stay indoors, hope goes away? hope people suddenly decide get vaccinated? Unbelievable. Honestly. 

Villainous. would hell lot better businesses Covid went away. Covid go away batshit crazy conservatives refusing take vaccine even wear mask. total collective viral load also needs low possible! ? going ignore UK India? Speaking purely analytical view... 1,000,000 per day infected right now, considering way infections increase exponentially, form ""herd immunity"" would quickly result. all, around 50% total US population fully vaccinated another 7% least one dose. Leaving around 140 million unvaccinated (but portion population antibodies previous infection). put herd immunity quotes believe virus remain endemic least foreseeable future. want clip ""shame me"" used political ads. Got Pfizer shots far, frankly either mRNA shot would fine Nice. Hopefully findings corroborated.  7/72=10 7% gives 10 periods doubling time. 27/72=2..3 somewhere 2 3 periods doubling time. Ya, mean news even worse realize. Varicella estimated [R0 around 10-12 common really high. theoretical herd immunity formula = 1 - 1 / R0 would imply required herd immunity level 1 - 1/10 = 90%.

The CDC's [own internal presentation suggests Pfizer 2-dose 64-87% effective delta variant  see problem - even vaccinate 100% population, 87% efficacy, quite reaching herd immunity delta variant.

Fortunately, there's wiggle room here, delta's true R0 Rt values, likewise levels natural immunity seems provide protection delta. hate state logic $35K year farmer uses speaking stock market records highs. Tetanus. Flu. Pneunomia. Shingles.

Not sure point is, lots. main times I’ve seen lockdowns hospitals gotten overwhelmed. seems like states South feeling pressure. don’t know they’re going do. one hand would guess they’re going lock hospital capacity limits Delta beast. Willful ignorance new eighth deadly sin - willfully ignoring science vaccines = death.  Good. Let kill supporters. Maybe Texas flip faster.  Uh oh.

Especially since we're seeing protection serious disease persists, sterilizing immunity fades time. equations laid show something much speculation. Idiots. least looks like less them. mess Texas.

You'll probably get sick. Yep. Important emphasise! article experts saying vaccination stop talking can't even take premise article seriously?

If lock lock country borders virus zero slowly start reopening. understand politically unfeasible let's act like solution. That's misleading interpretation data, though.

The cause hospitalization Post-vaccination infection hospitalization defined post-vaccination case hospital admit date day first positive COVID test date; hospitalizations verified COVID-associated. really.
