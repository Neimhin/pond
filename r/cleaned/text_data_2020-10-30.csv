0,2020-10-30," Huge numbers. best. bestest hugest numbers world. told. Yeah, like 83k cases last Friday determined lie. only, non mask wearers could stricken first. Alas. value put lives declines second endangered life, forth. Charity ads raise money focusing one person instead many. Compassion fades people. 

Here's video explaining Stephen Fry's calming either shut business, shut population. Eventually, they'll shut down. Maybe guy needs make useful. Maybe could mop floors Covid units lend nurse's aides hand physically demanding Covid care. Maybe would see city needed temporary shut down. It‚Äôs ridiculous. need sub somewhere lockdown one. Kind like need president Democrat republican. ain‚Äôt happening either. . . actually mis-typed it! meant say ‚Äúdo get hospitalized.‚Äù intent show even covid survivors pay heavy price. Theres many anti science people effectively get everyone board. people directly effected take seriously. science really support this?

I thought young children enough viral load pose significant threat infection parents. understand saying. Look responses local disasters like tornadoes hurricanes. Calls go aid nation usually responds. different here? source? Fact Check: Thanksgiving? Try Valentine‚Äôs Day....Jesus. blame President that. lol believe not, got Covid-19 control. friends currently China everything returns normal except everyone wearing masks. authoritarian state, power, manpower, willingness control disease litter regard human rights, fucking works pandemic Bill stroke pneumonia- good. Covid? going need time extra documentation... could Google fairly well known piece information yourself. Murderers. Lol. God. I'm nervous go dentist Monday üò¨

I get braces Monday morning scheduled cleaning later day dentist. cleaning know could wait on, root canal done year ago needs crown wait get til braces come off. build tooth supposed good like year, wanna push end worse situation later things Covid may even bleak are. 

I've orthodontist three times since June office always taken extreme precautions Covid, I've always felt safe.

But dentist office really mentioned anything Covid protocols I'm little scared...

I'm Los Angeles, know least they'll wear masks... I'm scared they'll wearing single surgical mask &amp; think that's enough??

I keep telling feel safe show up, always leave ... damnit, really need crown!! üòì I‚Äôm honestly confused dumb humans. happen Spanish flu literally happens MONTHS AGO!! I‚Äôm flabbergasted. never learn it‚Äôs inconvenient. already d....oh nevermind know saying, ""the best time plant tree 10 years ago second best time today""? sort like that. mobilized country make N95's March, would lot less cases deaths today. mean shouldn't. Necessary proper clause says sup. can't people refusing basic care around them.

the way going end disease becoming endemic people moving forward life. dont worry things go back normal mass hysteria ends

you could easily say people advocating restrictions selfish. harder get job participate advanced education chemistry labs. Yeah one point monkeys. I‚Äôm going bunny trail you. Like said I‚Äôm debate. good one. death rate 6%. Today, roll die. Tomorrow, roll die again.

You keep rolling die die, stop.

The choice clear, right?

Riiiiight?  Right, doesn‚Äôt infringe people public decency laws do. official language CIO election-related. (foreign powers, Russia) want maximum disruption/division.  Triple digits right around corner!

Edit: sextuple Rounding turn brick wall IRL (or mine least) seems way sometimes read comment sarcastic tone America way is, maybe wasn't. Okay, move there. Enjoy. Well good thing got electoral college /s I'll give hint:

üíµüíµüíµ

Think much money could made something like 9/11 grief, country music stadiums new weapons contracts fill. Grief COVID would mean approval lockdowns restrictions means less workers less people spending money, opposite that. can‚Äôt... words virus opened eyes selfish stupid many Americans are. realize, there‚Äôs untold scores counterparts countries around world. Covid spreading, know mean. Amazing beginning heard was, even scientists, masks straight didnt work anyway prepared catch matter what. we're learning beneficial, anything else. Actually people comply rules. Gyms bars always full. completely changing said. semantics. correct underrepresented given less voice non slaves. incorrect labelled 3/5 person False negatives. husband tested positive daughter negative. 3 us sick didn‚Äôt quarantine separately til results. ample time infect eachother. He‚Äôs firefighter 8 months pregnant gone dr appointments since March.  doctors said probably tested outside window false negative since sick too. husband way worse got second wave exactly daughter had.  could‚Äôve worse since exposed viral load. even though like think antibody purposes, continue though didn‚Äôt precaution wise.  lost mind? 160k dead counting there. worse death rate US. That‚Äôs brilliant. I‚Äôll remember runs something else midterms two years. one ever accuses virtue signaling wearing seatbelt. week still light out. There‚Äôs nothing understand. It‚Äôs excuse coming weak, spineless individual.  long go Disney There's new Covid cases US last 3 days, Canada 8 months obama day get experience may cry. initially cared much, me, becoming everyone unifying message, national leadership, stimulus.

so feds want take responsibility dont get blame, one working level.  .... pranked? bar example seems bit disingenuous: bar activities (drink, eat) wearing mask? Waiting ""It go away election"" folks change talking point ""It go away inauguration"" ""go away election"" Probably learned US. used best world pandemic response, taught rest world, January 2017. Sick article, friend!

I‚Äôm going see trying programs.

There 100% happy medium found staying informed subject wild world network news clickbait mega outlets.

A lot local papers big cities fairly good job imo. trump said beat coroney Penis Walmart requires masks every store US. see, stops door. inside, nothing enforced.  Right. means know sick isn't.
And. deaths reported ""unknown causes"" likely covid tests arent picking up.
200 days without domestic covid infections yet many cases exported virus countries.
It seems Taiwan asian countries Japan doing. 
With 23 million population, they've done 220,971 they're testing people symptoms.
So, looks like open things back up, test get praised well handling pandemic, right? HARAMBE!! Errr they're ""projecting"" power unity...by implementing strict lockdown measures get country up-and-running faster almost nation world? population 1.5 billion?

If ""projection"", goddamn sign Well super-preditors better using pill drugs rather needle bill sharing drugs! fairness side argument, slippery slope argument /sentiment. taking away AR 15 imo. 

Logically makes sense wear masks becomes whole different ballpark mandated enforceable gov police. Notwithstanding issues comes trying enforce thing, issue potentially becoming excuse restrictions people's freedoms future. 

IMO important wear masks voluntary enforced socially culturally.

 I'm responding think healthy necessarily assume worst others different opinion specific issue, political not. actions directly purposefully put people danger either life altering side effects including death, think deserves whatever comes him. state's democrat governor put several mandates effect republican controlled state supreme court appeal it. shit Definitely Saturday. Halloween gonna cause problems Yes.. explicitly allowed per process process united states national plan way manage it. makes happy? Today learned myopic means. Thanks internet. follow damn lockdown procedure, CJ! oh. think education mandated. Wear helmet leave house. sue parents malpractice. whats point? 91,000 figure ""reported"" number too, least got tested wait 3 days! get result, ok testing ramp up, people wait 7 days, test useless! Based case numbers people even social distancing dude bet even read article know survey I'm seeing 85% area. place see high compliance stored mandate even lot nose chin. someone's trip Target times week call much anything. look Table 3 general risk household transmission 10% , go 3% precautions taken. best.

Riding car: 4% risk transmission according precautions described, risk would close zero. Avoid long conversations enclosed spaces also important, see nicely illustrated article would difficult hide overrun, autocratic regime trying project power unity simply cannot believed issues like this. rules subreddit applied, comment would removed. problem people expression political views, becomes problem rules selectively enforced. Comments anti-mask mandate get removed political, pro-mask mandate comments stay. Either remove both, neither. 2020 mood. exactly mood. think France celebrates Thanksgiving? wonder possible 2.3 million subscribers sub varying opinions. What's going Italy right now? initial shock pandemic worn many, become regular part life. pathetic prepared. 

We wanted tax cuts. called pandemic planning pork barrel politics slashed spending it. 

Now paying price. Oh god one guys idiot. doesn‚Äôt impact you, cares?

The first correct thing you‚Äôve said thread! Well, hopefully January we‚Äôll resume following pandemic playbook taught successful nations like South Korea Thailand thrown 4 years ago. young man, wearing nothing linen garment, following Jesus. seized him, fled naked, leaving garment behind.

Mark 14:51‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨52 NIV predict Michael Hunt Carmen San Diego dining lot MI. clarify goal help businesses, virus? disagree many people celebrate holloween parties , really holiday off. Whereas get like 4 days Thanksgiving tell many corona virus vaccines created year.....zero. Thanks playing! posts give secondhand embarrassment Everyone knew happening seemed like nothing could stop it. felt powerless executive branch kept destroying respected institutions.

VOTE

VOTE TODAY can. VOTE early. Take time vote election day, prepared. Make plans vote. least germans tell truth. CEO Biontech last sentence press speech ""It still possible vaccine may fail"". read article. Exposed? Everyone knows it‚Äôs there, don‚Äôt care. legal government tell citizen need pay another citizen services providing, without subsidizing payments? 


In lock downs, business forced closed government still providing services customers free. closed.


If government concerned public health, subsidize renting cost relocate renters government paid housing. 


In area live, housing/renting still high demand. may dropped 10-15 percentage high, still high. people paying people begging get money free market? 


Will moratorium lifted once? happens, people get evicted month? exit strategy this? disease getting worse rural Republican states then? Agreed. Virtually everyone it. Denmark says better Sweden. Sweden says better Czech. Canada says better USA. UK says better Belgium. (Not really sure Belgium says however). 
But honestly western living Asia I‚Äôm worried global perceptions democracy. Frankly western governments responses Fcking walking advertisement virtues Authoritarianism. Every single western country looks like pathetic joke Asia moment. People absolutely astounded richest, privileged countries world pretty much completely lost control virus. (Sorry aussies kiwis honestly one cares). countries best universities still arguing virtues masks. 
This going broad implications (negative) people‚Äôs perceptions democracy decades. Pretty much Europe instituted mask mandates done jack shit stop case growth.

To clear, America taking steps help mitigate (give bars restaurants money stay closed keep employees payroll would big one). mask mandate ain't it. I‚Äôm sorry hear. government strict lockdowns testing numbers still time high flu season people parties ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hmmm. think that‚Äôs fair point it‚Äôs main reason minorities uninsured disproportionately suffering.

Lack access health care lack quality health care cause inequities. Consider migrants don‚Äôt legal status new country stuck wrong country, refugees living areas poor standards living. That‚Äôs reality large swathe US, US hit even harder third world low HIQ countries US, also lack care fellow man. mean Biontech? city set new rule landlords charge late fee equivalent 5% rent maximum $25. landlord charges $45 late fee still refuses listen city rule. millions stupid stupid people [now. explain think 38% are?

""Church None Fucking Business"" saying since preventable death statistically commonplace, ignore society conditions alter death numbers?  beleive grief displayed every day preventable deaths pragmatic ways.

Seat belt laws, food safety laws, speed limits, fire building codes examples pragmatic expressions reactions grief. nobody cared, none laws would exist. society exist paralyzed grief, grief expressed personal legislative action. 

National grief displayed pallitive expressions sympathy, combined pragmatic assessment risk change society based assessment. shaped society real ways, missing conversation Covid. Lol Wisconsin's cases surging definitely gonna lock don‚Äôt mean dick, actually good way gain perspective. want gain perspective situation given country, one must is. . .look numbers published country‚Äôs respective authority. want see strategy working time, considerably higher amount effort made significant period time. raw numbers don‚Äôt actually make true comparison way informs person true perspective regards what‚Äôs happening somewhere else. No.

Looking cellphone records purchase history digs everything you, far better everyone involved preempt that. *checks profile*
Active r/conspiracy Taiwan country idiot like [this even fully confirmed plus scientist reinfected problem carry convenient really... good.

People still cleaning themselves, food typically cold drive home, usually takes longer cooking.

You may willing put lot people aren‚Äôt.

They probably aren‚Äôt seeing level business seeing dine days thought encouraging dine way fix it. *facepalm*

Please excuse autism. virus care per capita lol positivity rate hospitalization rate look COVID  Spain  brought mainly plane. It‚Äôs going harder fight rural areas lack staff equipment facilities 

In Manhattan take Madison square garden make hospital bring workers New Jersey 

In western Montana can‚Äôt get workers Mine unicars flying corns! Hospitalizations still lower right definitely trending way up. really hope see level getting hand like last two spikes. slow moving train wreck. family visited northern Idaho back late July. pleasantly surprised see many people wearing masks. Definitely all. California wearing masks since March. nice see. HOWEVER, folks LOVE Trump. someone ‚Äújoke‚Äù us shouldn‚Äôt move there. told way hell we‚Äôd move Trump country. Northern Idaho‚Äôens different kind weird. Could worse. could Midland/Odessa. gym requires mask enter lobby leave. you‚Äôre past front desk it‚Äôs required anymore. think overestimating strong economy is. built piles debt expectation debt generate income principle interest. Even coronavirus even hit, facing downturn. can't afford lose ""just"" 10% workforce. government runs deficit every single year. can't afford lose workers practical sense. 

Also, many industries would expect struggling. busy grocery stores are, owners near reporting lowest profits ever had. paying tons protective equipment, extra staff losing money holiday products need heavily discounted. owners small logistics firms panicking hard, business slow sharply cutting drivers hours even deliveries themselves. beginning financial spiral. county colosseum offers drive thru, that's main one downtown, others well. example, Oz Glaze senior center Horizon offering drive up. designated parking spots could park could complete ballot car. colosseum site actual drive thru classic sense. 

I'm sure complete list sites offering contactless services is. probably find online though. üôÑ Masks work. curb pandemic stop one. works 6 months, need 16 billion doses year get everyone twice. 

It's called salesmen, tell great product buy it. said, doubt heard. El Paso actually quite left leaning. think 10,000 daily deaths possible. frustrating still quarantining everyone else living best life, going each, bars, distancing. get drag covid even longer.... Per capita us many times fewer cases lot European countries. Yeah, I'm bit concerned ""abundance caution"" turning FDA dragging feet record zero love T"""""""". Well red cross would buy supplies, testing mobilizing doctors go hard hit areas....none done believe yet knew them. Anyone else support mask mandate thinks shut downs feasible? Thanks telling me. Germany, started lockdown much earlier curve (start lockdown 22 days ICUs would full according calculation), allowed meet two household 10 people. I'm extra glad did. Rishi like Worf Star Trek. role make suggestions slapped Picard violent, order solve problems rationally. 

Only Rishi supposed supporting economy, he‚Äôs good at. needs someone aware cost human lives argue him, unfortunately none exist Tory Leadership. basically Klingons. Currently, **RNA vaccines** approved human use. - Google

not sure question could answered, due samples small Stage 1 2 trials - reddit dude allowed? question irrelevant. fact is, allowed. 

And since discussing more, 

There federal mandate masksso masks allowed? obviously unsure status pending tests, allowed fly. airline policy also Hawaii's policy. Everyone plane comply policy.

Which bullshit. policy put money lives.

No idea continue put money lives. Given CDC health bodies traced outbreak clusters planes, answer no. wonder Chris Hayes MSNBC going follow video discussing Europe worse US? obsession ""normalcy"" EU US failing COVID response. ridiculous countries states offering free rapid testing. pandemic could controlled much efficiently rapid testing focused potential spreaders. Rounded corner upwards ahla ackbar Thanks boss. never scared ashamed live Idaho. Time start looking home state... I'm helping smaller landlords, charging late fee's right dick move. guys rounded corner guys! Guys? ""no religious affiliation""?

That's catch bucket. Could atheist, agnostic, believes God exists identify particular church. Yup, difference convenient government point finger towards protests trying get rid of. 
The little ogre power ( one really charge puppet president called *pen* sign anything told little ogre) even national speech addressed far fight hooligans pacify protesting women. basicky told green light use violence towards protesting women, winked face real consequences dirty work . mean, big state. Air Force people month ago. created Space Force Dec 2019, created Air Force Space Command. us working Command time got assigned Space Force Air Force members. Space Force members besides Chief Space Ops others lot us started permanently transferring Space Force last month. longer Air Force, Space Force. So, time, Space Force entirely built Air Force. However, bringing Army Navy Space soon enough well.

tl;dr-- yes,  EU keep things control. spreads less summer clearly. long days outdoor activity spread diseases. 

It's coming US worse EU. fucking see saw back forth asanine. El Pasoan here. Every time go out, everyone wearing masks.  Many people shaking heads wondering spread coming from.  guess family gatherings bars. El Pasoans like party. Yeah, love ""Well *we* wear masks"". Guess what, see anyone stores Houston wearing masks either. mandatory long time now.

It's always area good uptick oh one wearing masks.

Europe amazing 100% mask compliance *no one* US wearing masks, new uptick Europe everyone saying ""Yeah, well surprise wears masks here.""

I'm saying Texas perfect, major cities masks requirements while. Bars closed ages Houston now. think main complaint would constitutes ""restaurant"" gotten pretty laxed indoor seating never going get numbers low enough another uptick opinion. change India gets winter seasons. still hot there, even north. means farting man Well got rid asylum system 70s choosing instead outpatient small facility family like rehoming. idea let severely disabled mentally ill live society, better integrated it.

I guess success since appeared run lt governor. honest see mostly slap Mayor trying provide reasonable quarantine response Governor able resist taking dump Austin every opportunity. City Council best, think would look like El Paso right Mayor Adler told Abbott fuck off. many people, particularly foreigners &amp; uneducated, fail understand America nation founded equal union states - distinct nations world, born urban center conquering surrounding &amp; establishing region gov'ts administrative regions capital politics. means *Federal* mask mandate would absolutely violate founding principles Republic (particularly 10th Amendment). going mask mandates, citizens need lobby state gov'ts them. Wow, never heard before. Thank you!! common churches throughout us, parts us? right started going beaches back April. Everyone sub losing minds beaches open. Meanwhile fantastic Summer beach, got plenty sunshine, get sick once. Imagine that. mother retired ICU physician. regards COVID less respiratory illness inflammatory process epithelial cells (which line blood vessels, etc). Apparently would account multitude ways sickens people blood clots leading strokes, heart attacks organ damage. line right sums type people nutshell. selfish narcissists give thought care greater good ""acquiring"" ""possessing"". 54% majority people use term evangelical actually mean ""christian"". parts country parts dont. 

i quick google search (probably similar yours) saw christian sources claiming high 70% christian, articles seemed strong agenda christian articles saying 30%

50% sounds reasonable, though proving would probably involve lots definition clarifications hope virus done teach country less individualistic selfish. Unfortunately it‚Äôs deeply ingrained society would take massive casualties change. Freeburty. That‚Äôs great. won‚Äôt sitting president January. People continue wear masks, especially private gatherings, ‚Äúmandate‚Äù yeah, that‚Äôs also totally unhelpful unnecessary  shut up. Herd immunity strategy. Stop spreading lies.  20 somethings awesome recommending video games high deductibles tv virtual reality systems.

Just know good Yes, means texas Republicans vehemently against. Keep up. Switzerland brink lockdown well. Might happen 7 14 days. dear leader doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs big deal they? Dear leader would never lie put danger. worry, I'll fine. post much **pants** mandate schools prevents students getting Catholic education, Lansing elementary school argues new lawsuit state.  accordance teachings Catholic faith, Resurrection School believes every human dignity made God‚Äôs image likeness,‚Äù plaintiffs said lawsuit. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, **pants** shield humanity.

Fixed them. say common give numbers? Florida fudging test numbers. death rate still 50% ath. RemindMe! 3 months  Washington, DC. Since probably mid-May I'd say 97% people, even sidewalks wear mask properly, including little kids. think people included felt like jerk wearing one sidewalks since people well. Granted live high-traffic area. getting numbers? different reports OP? experts saying that, unless mean handful count May summer Viruses live fast die hard. Wouldn‚Äôt call plague. Quite different mortality rate exponential corner! Yes, do. I'm Michigan Texas get double embarrassment time  Seattle.

Though coworker went cabin weekend said nobody wearing mask gas station outside city.

There seems stark difference adherence basic pandemic hygiene... El Paso? Whataboutism. Worry state, since don‚Äôt give shit political level. Living Rent free head, guess driving job get horrible accident requiring immediate medical care icu full...then what? wont get streets pitchforks.. afraid nothing will. live across hospital would see taking bodies coolers. lost 3 friends. 2 neighbors saw everyday. April traumatizing. Probably even government calls concept ""Lockdown light"" lol. think lockdown easy word people understand nation enforces restrictions social life. True lockdown something like happened Wuhan. *slams book shut 

Like that's ever gonna happen reports Europe indicating may different strain virus. seems way infectious. also saw massive sudden spikes cases believe new strain reason it. Covid took vacation summer like everyone else. numbers going extreme hights now? know - I'm putting emphasis idiots making worse making innocent people sick. Yes reading this. Lulwut..... Ya, half measure enforced lead economic trouble cases still surging. take it, Capital name? Lol Best way describe lot people wearing mask like wearing seatbelt. Think last 6 months driving, didn‚Äôt wear seatbelt time would life different? people would say ‚Äúno.‚Äù people minor accidents would say ‚Äúa little.‚Äù people would dead dealing life long medical problems. problem right people don‚Äôt wear masks think fall 1st 2nd grouping. Either won‚Äôt catch won‚Äôt get sick. Damn that's useful site. similar ones states like California, example? I‚Äôm sorry went though that. don‚Äôt live anymore, used to...spent almost every night March April zoom (before tired it) friends live alone Brooklyn went that...I could see toll nights sirens stress took them. Welcome reddit. either super progressive alt right. middle ground, people, simply represented much. Haha no. Florida managed convince trump voters control fudging testing numbers. beginning rise spite it. daily death numbers still 1/2 time high.

So anti maskers gonna go Florida thanksgiving christmas ( assuming explosive growth Thanksgiving stop things ) party. bring back states. Dec/Jan gonna dire. wipe ass, blame trump isn‚Äôt clean? Shut dumbass. attorney general really fighting judges order shut down? words vaccines mostly job? wasn‚Äôt eradicating virus, getting point risk low enough go back normal ease. Come Tahoe report back. He/she dead wrong. Even local amusement park supposed open upcoming Spring. Along line, dimwitted politician Urbana, Ohio, said wear mask face God genocidal relevent Covid numbers? Im confused. Stay topic Let hoarding begin. time move beyond mere toilet paper. Whatever was, I'm sure Capital read. Sadly, that's I'm expecting see too. seem like anyone cares more. 100,000 per day looks like certainty. that, 200,000 day could month away. Ok Stalin Meanwhile freely give away information social media profiles...üòÇ RemindMe! 30 days leaders telling people everything fine sociopaths. access data. know many die. care. agree you! wear masks distance found 100% effective cure disease? tyrannies, tyranny sincerely exercised good victims may oppressive. would better live ruthless cruel dictator acting greater good. cruelty dictator may sometimes sleep, cupidity may points satiated; torment us good, torment us without end approval conscience. people play covid ratios, per capita stats bullshit really shut mouths.

just crappy way die Yeah could two years done, good idea People need stop shit. already saw spiking demand reason punishes dont horde. Supply there, bet ass toilet paper manufacturing jobs considered essential. think given political situation US fact federal support population comply hard long enough shutdown actually beat covid California come good system balances economic health concerns. I‚Äôm sure see spikes, don‚Äôt think California high chance seeing get bad enough hospitals overwhelmed. 100% correct. Absolutely not. unconstitutional.

Maybe states pass mandates, right pass federal law executive order. numbers R0 2.5 pandemic slow. 1st wave much bigger already January. test, need, mass keeling-overs. Remember Iran spring? basically found cases reached help ill. Italy woke wide community spread overnight Alps region full young folks enoying skiing. wave detects much cases, postitive rates worrysome, catch infections, still miss huge bunch, infections get older population another 50k dead UK, France, Spain, Italy each. Czechz didnt huge 1st wave celebrated end 1st. Sweden so. Germany moaning complaining also didnt saw anything first wave, 800k die per year, 8k first wave, peanuts. \*2cents  Oh great, morons saying masks vaccines.

Can stop misinformation shitty little lies tell other? SF bay area, people really great masks distancing. lucky live here. state's Attorney General told legal stop shutdown. drive voting don‚Äôt even get car. People determined united back March, April. lack leadership, mixed messages, contradictory rules left vacuum conspiracy deniers move in. Plus personal level, lose mind sitting home everyday world around seems go back normal consequence. 

Just like climate change...media government tries pass burden onto regular people minding business working taking care family. We‚Äôre ones power, can‚Äôt educate change anyone‚Äôs mind. barely teach first grader read. can‚Äôt enact laws policy curb carbon emissions increase testing virus. 

So don‚Äôt point finger other. leaders knew do. knew virus was. failed act, failed lead given up. don‚Äôt blame us. one year vs 1 life. Chicago public schools 360k students. Cook county currently 5.5k deaths. 65 kids lost education every life lost. Add things sacrificed made large sacrifice slow COVID. might worth it, screwed lot lives save lot lives. saw update Worldometers. wondered Belgium get hit much worse European countries first wave. now, happened again. previous disaster therefore fluke. government lot answer. thing live next park also football games time.  monkey doo doo We're going run people soon. leave water nurses station! Rules made reason. Nobody rules, especially mayors.

Rules??? Like Hatch Act, says can‚Äôt use Federal funds campaigning bars Federal employees engaging political activity duty. Things like holding fucking campaign rally South Law White House Secretary State giving RNC speech god damned Embassy Jerusalem. 

Or Emoluments Clause prohibits President profiting foreign governments. instance, officials Saudi Arabia reserving huge blocks rooms Trump International Hotel DC. 

Is NOBODY rules??? law already exists. quite.  heroin* Wont surprised bunch lawsuits employees contracted covid working clearly non-essential job. Like argue lot jobs essential dont seem like face value, shit like gamestop? Worthless. 13 11? numbers natural given random chance. Sheesh..idiotic. give 12 special meaning idea dozen. Right, best comparisons make. Trump cultists plug ears dismiss day mention Taiwan, New Zealand, etc ""small"" island countries. stick Canada, South Korea, Vietnam...they simply give filibuster change subject. bug later can't even bullshit way around those. You‚Äôre genius buddy. Go suck dick. committed mortal sin criticizing genocidal country Thank correction! Proof even multiple news sources gloss deets. several occasions China tested millions people course day two. requires great organization cooperation. also use technique 10-20 samples combined single test, reduces laboratory load order magnitude. batch tests positive go individual tests narrow down. want Old Testament God. I'll take New Testament Jesus chance. Yeah sure go ahead mandate masks fine people watch still happen. enforcement struggling stores restaurants commit comes bills vs health? 


How threaten people follow beyond fines? they'll contest court anyway pay.  


This teeth country leadership CONSISTENT. thought guys rounding corner saw 10% wearing masks grocery store today Portland Oregon. Seemed higher recently.  really hope everybody come back tell wrong was. See then, happy Thanksgiving.  read mask religion school??

SPIT respiration.  really need stop trying make analogy. 

As proven point: MASKS PROTECT YOU. protect OTHERS reducing 'germ cloud'. read mask bible, commandment 'SIX FEET SEPARATION **OR** WEAR MASK CLOSER'.

You get CV-19 hands air... that's important wash hands NEVER TOUCH MASK. Again, mask bible whole chapter 'once touch mask yer filthy paws, contaminated useless.

I know WAAY do.. cases continue rise unabated hospitalizations required, hospitals filled capacity. return death rate beginning pandemic, people access much worse treatment options. Asking dumbfuckistanis read articles? Pretty brave. ""Could rolled Christmas"" according asswipe CEO someone knows damn? Good reminder one immune. viral recombination fun! here. lot people already voted early sites offer drive thru/up voting, leave car, tomorrow last day early voting available. Guess we'll wait see Election Day turnout is. Yeah force people stop working don‚Äôt support people they‚Äôve forced stop working, wonder economy falling apart. don‚Äôt understand funky thing viral infections it‚Äôs ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù get infected. expose yourself, get infected. That‚Äôs works. Viruses don‚Äôt care religion brave people go pandemic. there‚Äôs bunch people sharing air without valid preventative measures one sick, everyone else risk.

The scorn comes people hear warnings ignore them, wail getting sick. Actions consequences. Well judge Samaniego says we're shutdown, mayor De Margo says we're not. confusing mess.  need watch it. Steve carrel doesn‚Äôt disappoint. That's accepted science. theory. literally means, someone looked little bit data said ""I've got idea"". 

If less virus system immune system getting less exposure it. equally likely lower initial viral load results time needed immune system react. gimme em zombies people cant work home going do? left starve?

Basically, yeah.

Republicans decided months ago people die keep economy rolling.

Just reminder Senate Republicans chose vote stimulus instead went vacation. dare try live life! 

/Reddit ‚ÄúAsia outside China‚Äù Asia whole? #LiBeRaTeElPaSo today S.Korea Hello Melbourne Australia. 

Locked hard 2 months cases hit low hundreds. Mandated masks.

Cases today. 4... Freedumb, ftfy. definitively pro Mainland China, want point out, everybody would highly suspicious Bejing would reported number. Also Even countries like Australia New Zealand ""eradicated"" virus numbers surged again.

So would take grain salt. So? read sub is: Make people follow guidelines, make people wear masks, force people stay away family holidays. testing vaccine kid far?

I thought dangerous disease, thought people dying left, right centre? 
I thought people die left worse crippling life long disabilities? 
You wanted take drastic action stop plague? Well is. squeamish now? Me! killing 50 million people worldwide. That's pretty much worst-case scenario. Sickening vaccine aren‚Äôt sharing it. ruling party able lie way every problem faced, think lie way one too. Well given incubation period, delay testing positive getting sick enough hospitalization least two weeks growth already baked in. Like double today. Got bit?

If grows week multiply well. vert close capacity point. Yes something done would need done ASAP. Like days, maybe week most. tell think anything really significant done time frame. guys say health officials won‚Äôt make significant changes. I‚Äôm relying part. Thank you. whole world watching. glasses

etc Modi, unlike Trump, actually takes shit seriously. He's probably right wing nationalist does. guy proves ignorant statement wrong he's stupid one? True article states risk reduced massively good ventilation guess matters people keep saying nonsense? controlling virus point. slowing spread stopped. stay vaccine even likely temporary fix much like flu vaccine every year. understand right? coming current data scientists studying virus. might want step self righteous echo chamber look facts. sayin. mean 1per/sec, damn. approve Dr. Fauci's message. much France pay covid jobless? term describing 'pooled tests' Slovakia aiming for. Pooled tests work expected ambient level incidence low (less 1% infected). Pilot test rounds hard-hit districts Slovakia came 3-4% incidence. Pooling would turn almost every sample positive.

Slovaks tested quick affordable antigen test. good enough medical use, sufficient detect enough infectious people severely reduce transmission community.

Keep mind current predicament European countries result R suddenly skyrocketing, function low R brewing long time. estimates R (in France) around 1.25 since August. Thus, even antigen testing badly flawed, still likely push R significantly 1. don‚Äôt know read graphs red white blue fuk yeaaahhhh concerned different concern ""it's gonna 4 weeks"". saying done fact nothing done prevent postpone it. Literally using ""inevitable"". best say us seem exponential growth yet. Could agree more, especially dick-waving contest. That's reason pick worst performing states EU compare US average. 

Only valid comparison EU whole US whole. Macron basically promised wouldn‚Äôt go back lockdown

Is true? exact wording hand remember promise everything avoid lockdown, promise go back lockdown. maybe us interested multi -faceted approach reduce risk rather trying find one silver bullet stops getting it. far silver bullet shown rather elusive. 

Also, dust accumulation inside glasses always significantly less outside. argued nicely yourself. 

Anyway, never said glasses would protect getting Covid, actually said comparison face shields good one gave reason why. 

But sub suit nice day stay safe, however choose that. clarification exactly country referring to?...as investigate things country immune virus controlled entirely. New Zealand fascinating there...

Gatorfan Hope comforts 234,177 dead bodies. Rest peace. basics, wash youre hands keep distance. important masks. reckon anyone aggressively promotes perfect probably interested cautious statements. Water Country, fun¬Æ Even example supports it. Tiananmen Square massacre wasn‚Äôt hidden world, literally covered CNN live. 

During early days course actual number cases much larger reported numbers. government literally repeatedly said warned people bottlenecked tests. country first hit *new virus*, testing ramped way faster China actively hid vital information regarding initial outbreak allowed spread world.

No country earth would fully stopped spread new virus contagious flu. country ever country ever will, that‚Äôs works. think virus originated US somehow we‚Äôd stopped spreading? People said europe. weeks later deaths started accelerate. So, saying things go plan, try different plan next time, idea plan be? 
Yup. politician right. Lots words, said nothing. else new? happened governments paying billions make doses advance lol. Im saying wrong think pesimistic message might cause people give up. think, dont source claim, wars keep morale high like war, sort of. Seems original claim Belgium country accurately reporting, possibly overreporting, cases deaths. NoVA would say 95% masking public. Depends old 50 underlying conditionsn, may even get shot risk get ill low. handed gun 99 chambers one bullet said 
'you pull trigger stay home month, pull trigger also force everyone contact week pull similar trigger.' 

What would do?

If choose pull trigger well good, understand lot us wouldn't. evidence people actually better past today, romanticizing past?

(This honest, non-rhetorical question know answer to, criticism). Nice Poe, idea serious not. realize China literally invent COVID PCR tests scratch, even then, testing ramped up, confirm cases chest x-ray miss anyone.

Oh countries hiding cases, knowing they'd get falsely blamed origin. Next week? end next sentence? Now! Yup. screeching listed article.

Thanks playing. city that? Zero *legal* recourse, say?

I cannot condone real life violence, making like Dream flint steel Minecraft... thinking earlier today...I always believe situations it‚Äôs smarter err safe side. Also, think would easy celebrate creative ways, like scavenger hunt even ‚ÄúHalloween Christmas‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure child would remember really cool, special Halloween. 

But curious much danger infection Trick treating realistically poses possible consequences could expect see result it. 

Is actually possible spread covid if, say, someone infected covid personally hands candy children doorway? likely even possible spread covid getting germs candy hand out? much danger actually posed don‚Äôt wear masks doorway whilst handing out? Say super spreader? dramatically increase risk? 

I saw day CDC lowered threshold risk infection (or something like that) 3 close (less 6ft?) interactions infected individual. read defined interaction 15 minutes long. 

So, would assume wouldn‚Äôt really happen trick treating. sounds likely truck treats. 

Does anybody know realistic risk posed here? live CO, far Springs. CO springs fb forum chock full people talking plans trick treat. haven‚Äôt seen single person say otherwise. far looks like Australia New Zealand really succesfull hard lockdowns unfortunately. Depending define succesfull guess. ~~gives~~ *gave* shit Joe Rogan ~~anymore~~?

FTFY San Antonian here, El Paso residents starting drive due fact everything full capacity, it‚Äôs 8 hour drive. Unfortunately seems like large percentage people actually need see even believe covid real. Ultimate goal rt value 0.999 less forever. 1.08 high. know sounds selfish, I'm worried Las Cruces. huge amount population commutes El Paso, massive elderly community, infrastructure deal real outbreak. top that, week's snow helping anything. Officially never used. people consistently act like Americans countries poorly? It‚Äôs guess I‚Äôm claiming expert. I‚Äôve spent whole life analyzing data however running teams mathematicians physicists I‚Äôm pretty good predictions. obviously different completely. 
Hopefully correct big man Tegnell concerned shouldn‚Äôt be? 120 development. one fails, next one goes top queue one fails tries again. Well legally speaking mayor El Paso Texas power least Texas state law declare national least city wide health emergency close nonessential businesses kind like storms state government really doesn‚Äôt power keep considering elective official city powers state constitution declare state emergency particular city El Paso hospitals basically capacity like one ICU bed left, think somewhere around like maybe two ventilators available future patients they‚Äôre getting every day El Paso really hard hit closing nonessential businesses makes sense keep people dying plan continue live country responsible government lets scientists guide practices. laughable dismissal viability controlling virus via behavior modification policy instantly alerted simply given up.

When vaccine available, government get charge - like healthcare available me. I've house since March. fucking hard unless years people nihilistically independent. Relax. HA cases higher per capita Paris? great remote regions. Plus hospital hits capacity, deaths pick due lack proper care area. Oooh boy this'll suck... Hope never happen. 

Lockdown impossible, vaccine takes time, #MaskDontWork. 

What else could do?  Today heard district, parents may need make decision come January, can‚Äôt get back face 2 face cases go up, parents one last time decide return face 2 face second semester remain virtual rest entire year. think parents started virtual, reasons made smart choice. don‚Äôt judge it, tough make choice, better long run- fear parents made face 2 face choice don‚Äôt really get option opt back far know. is, me, single important heartbreaking video I've seen pandemic. understand downvoting post; scientists understand share one world. sarcastic, hard know days? closed, come back 4 years, sorry ! expert opinion based data. like guess win next World cup sort? 

Sweden doubled normal ICU capacity spring almost warning serious lack preparedness. field hospital set never used. hope come now, already shown possible higher capacity time doubt sit wait see happens now. Currently COVID-19 patients account 15% ICU beds 4x amount patients still 20% free capacity country-wide. current ICU capacity put back normal June. possibility expand, maximum numbers now. There's need guess RTFA.

Like, what's point information posted people can't even bothered read instead use dumb memes gather useless karma? wonder west poorly. Also, Australian state Victoria made payments people awaiting test results isolating due positive results. remove financial barriers people staying home be. I'm among ones mocked, find productive Spaniard, like plenty screwups own. Plus, many American friends reaction things going hell empathy, mocking.

That said, can't blame people thinking America objectively worse EU countries. clearly did. mean, leaders taking enough measures far Trump's denialism. leaders denying pandemic, saying flu discouraging mask use; outright ignoring problem nothing like state governors.

Why clearly worse situation America, then? view, think mainly two possibilities. One that, replies say, second wave US really started yet, does, could disastrous. byproduct different lifestyles continents - America much lower population density, less packed cities, less use mass transit, individualistic life, meaning Europe basically playing handicap respect America.

Personally I'm much believer ""waves"" (I think future system basically depends current state things done now, ""waves"" consequence those, unstoppable independent phenomenon) see much reason second one would arrive late US (I suppose seasonal/climatology factors arrive less time continents) think may second choice, Europe would harder time US *in spite fact that*, insist, US clearly handles COVID much worse.

I'd careful first option, though... hope not. Genuinely curious, explain 10,000 variation, 7 hours post Worldometers, due rolling average/calculation? Take care stay safe Might want edit comment. Maybe. wasn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt get point, didn‚Äôt get mine. 

You‚Äôre saying shouldn‚Äôt complain people fucking world war 2 worse it‚Äôs ridiculous you‚Äôre making comparison. 

Other people worse mean problems invalid can‚Äôt complain them. 

Nobody I‚Äôve ever met said anything imply locking house bad Jew world war 2. You‚Äôre one making comparison, you‚Äôre pulling right ass. 

Why even stop there? people complaining world war 2 like lives sooooo hard. It‚Äôs like don‚Äôt even realize bad Black Death was! privileged. 

Grow fuck up. Yeh course, I‚Äôd him. point wants open restaurants, comedy clubs etc, reason seems think that‚Äôs ok.  would presume trying infect meeting COVID patients unprotected would expose oneself potentially huge viral loads. case, amount vaccine - antibodies - would've able prevent getting second time. still remember Trump's interview around February claimed 1 case totally umder control. 

And add more.. WH document shows defeated COVID...

Reckless ashamed country. Oh crud. Here's lousy 2020. here. don‚Äôt recall statement getting close one... remember growing polio outbreaks. mother wouldn‚Äôt even let brother go outside polio reported anywhere near Kansas City neighborhood. years later got drug school cafeteria given first polio shot. ordered vaccinations literally thousands newborns statement bit curious. following vaccine development particularly intrigued Moderna mRNA approach. vaccine come. Hopefully taken. since making antibodies likely use booster. plans?....

I'm expat France, put someone straight plane office, quarantine, test. Needless say, strongly believe country deserves whatever comes next. point sub Yes wear masks can. article discussing clearly says droplets nothing aerosols. entire purpose article thread show people infection still occur masks social distancing aerosol transmission. evidence masks(not respirators) could filter aerosols may plausible, fact mask without airtight seal would excluded, would may potential options slim.


""If viral inoculum matters determining severity SARS-CoV-2 infection, additional hypothesized reason wearing facial masks would reduce viral inoculum wearer exposed subsequent clinical impact disease. Since masks filter virus-containing droplets (with filtering capacity determined mask type),2 masking might reduce inoculum exposed person inhales. Germany necessarily handle current pandemic better

And right Germany handling pandemic well.

Just countries problem eventually nurses/doctors - Germany significantly larger amount _equipment_ artificial ventilation countries historical reasons¬π, really much medical personell. 

Some equipment (and think is) shipped countries need (and nurses ventilators), course countries might ship doctors nurses Germany utilise less easy transport beds ventilators.

¬π short simplified version: assumption cold war gets hot bad shit happen middle Germany. expected lead mass casualties requiring artificial ventilation civilian population, military civil protection designed ability pull medical hardware storage put emergency field hospitals many ventilation beds pretty much anywhere Germany short notice. end cold war policies reviewed, decided still makes sense keep level ability even without immediate cold war threat.

You find stats anywhere, got John Hopkins there's widget Google pops numbers google ""covid-19 deaths USA"". 

I used boat, thinking NY handled pandemic well south joke.. I'm wondering valid metric *infections* vs *deaths*. graphs currently put Texas top, due infection rate, slightly half deaths New York!

Ps. healthy criticism important part humanity. people seem willing subjugate selves strong powerful government. much scarier virus. go ask real. Yay! get kill without actually shooting now! wouldn‚Äôt say *exactly* like Taliban ISIS.

What proposed - federal ""mandate"" without tying federal funding - probably unconstitutional due 10th amendment, even successfully navigate claiming ""interstate commerce,"" can't enforce it. Federal law enforcement going go fine businesses - can't ""fine businesses."" There's pesky thing called ""due process"" - gets go court administrative tribunal, case, proposing, would federal court, we're completely honest: federal district court messing that. US Attorney, would prosecuting violations, messing that. federal law enforcement agencies messing that. Hell, magistrate federal district court already hard enough time dealing wrapping head around once-a-month misdemeanor ""federal traffic &amp; conservation ticket"" docket.


Again - federal mask mandate effective constitutional, would tied funding: state mandate, get money. federal government time time done effectively so-called ""national drinking age,"" national 55mph speed limit place late 70s early 90s. potentially billions dollars relief aid line, states going buck Enforcing isn‚Äôt important need President Congress strongly emphasize masks save lives.

Just want flip coin don‚Äôt.  President deny existence H1N1 accuse taking protective measures anti-American weakness. Imagine that. Almost like started challenge trials positive safety data... Otherwise go school, get infected go grandparents parents anyway infecting everyone home. May well keep home without infection part. Taiwan, South Korea, Japan never locked okay. Also, many people degree cross-immunity previous infection colds caused coronavirus. solution expected people would simply forego lives two years realistic solution. Source? want tax paying dollars going Biden nazis smh !!! cannot see able make cruises safe high community spread currently. say test crew passengers day sailing, incubation period 14 days contact test negative? high percentage false negatives? testing preventive strategy partially effective. takes one infected person infect many, especially work food service bartending. Even people wear masks time, wear eating. 

Once vaccines come along (assuming effective!), easier; require vaccination. originally intended say stereotype especially southern white people, also used white people America. Apologies. said, fact racist stereotype used white people America, implies saying ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù ISIS. case unaware, ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù symbolizes white. subreddit cult masks. There's cult non-maskers too, somewhere else.
Just get used it.

My issue effectively shuts valuable thinking (like: improve invest better quicker testing?), repeats mantra masks solve everything.

Everyone wears masks pretty much everywhere go. shit. It‚Äôs WHOLE HOLE. It‚Äôs me, I‚Äôll try give brief explanation. First, make sure look graph orange blue lines visualize I‚Äôm trying explain! 

Basically ROC curve plots sensitivity (1-specificity). Sensitivity tells test correctly identify people disease, specificity tells well test identifies people without disease. Basically screening tool, trade two. want maximize sensitivity also maximizing specificity (so don‚Äôt get false positives), work other. 

If randomly classify people disease state, would get straight diagonal line, Y=x. ROC curve (hopefully) lies left this, also higher (or else screening tool would worse random assignment). WANT ROC curve hug upper left corner tightly possible. means get maximum sensitivity also getting false positives. 

So follow lines curve, pick arbitrary point- say sensitivity 95%. gives corresponding specificity (let‚Äôs say, 95%). say ‚Äúhmm, want sensitivity higher! need catch 99% people covid!‚Äù trade comes in. plot sensitivity 99%, you‚Äôll ALSO see specificity also necessarily decrease follow curve- let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 85% now. Basically, catch extra 4% people, increased false positivity rate 5% 15%. worth it? That‚Äôs question decide. You‚Äôll people stressed worried, people trying get lab test, people quarantining missing work unnecessarily, maybe even giving contact tracers work. 

So OP basically saying trade might necessarily great, maybe 90% sensitivity small specificity, every gain make sensitivity offset huge loss specificity. 

What would say response curve includes people officially diagnosed covid- may actually inaccuracy there. ROC curve people ‚Äúofficial‚Äù looks even better. overall, actually pretty good. AUC (area curve) .97 official model .95 ‚Äúall.‚Äù AUC=1 would perfect classification 0.5 would random classification (that diagonal y=x line). screening tools, lot people usually think pretty good. context, article says AUC current serology tests .88-.97. tbh model good lab test classifying them! ""Wearing mask looks extreme me!"" hear that, ‚ÄúWestern Governments?‚ÄùCome ‚Äúbetter solution‚Äù highly-transmissable virus none us immunity against. ‚ÄúEastern Goverments,‚Äù presumably, alright lockdowns.

Thanks info. States failed keep citizens safe shipping people hospitals nearby states. We're seeing Utah Idaho. Maybe even more. re-election order? India gaining us put big numbers forget people transplant lists die waiting organs number usable ones available goes support lockdown September people would've ignored it. hard enough keep peace London summer... yes, economy important, keeps hospitals operating first place one praising NK, maybe China extent they've managed keep virus control even that's generally ability mass testing + take stricter lockdown measures necessary. People praising Chinas foreign policy, human rights record etc.  go gym either, set working mask whole time. 

So regards physical, become winded easily train thought seems slightly slipping, issues lightheadedness? How's overall health? bmi?

I've experienced extreme lightheadedness since lockdowns times. Doctors know what's causing tested negative antibodies September (which mean I've never Rona). Doubt it. probably gonna cross 100,000 cases day, 1500 go 1 hour left sound fun cases one day entirety Chinese's reported data 

and billion people US..

WOW No. old idea. disproved. Recent studies say kids contagious less affected. fear two weeks deeper lockdown. Schools still open limited measured contain spread. TTI system overwhelmed areas.  Well entire nation hit point once. states right uncontrolled community spread may hit exponential growth soon. 

I'm Florida cases edging up. county, Monroe, we're surge hospital chief staff concerned county could headed toward exponential growth, state whole not. IMO biggest mistake &amp; CDC ignoring basic ventilation practices could teaching people FUCKING MARCH!
Instead attention put sanitation theater able see result gets colder people spend time inside poorly ventilated spaces together.

Jesus Christ OPEN FUCKING WINDOWS DOORS! looking on-track cross 100,000 today, [98618 time writing 1 hour left I'm outdoor spaces. much room taken parking. Prevention also invisible working.

What happens violent crime committed inside polling place election day?  police close access place, crime scene?  election equipment still inside? Oof, guess we're going find months. Perhaps Dakotas highest per-capita infection rate, per-capita death toll. hope not, but... make valid point. work well cases exploding everywhere hmmmmm Gotta vote stupid out. Let‚Äôs go Idaho One predicts deaths dropping back previous baseline. One predicts staying high previous baseline. absolutely different theories. logic life expectancy correct, change fact killed everyone going live 2 years,  survivors would higher life expectancy population whole before. Whereas took 2 years life everyone equally, we'd see different result lot deaths front followed deaths time. America level numbers probably shut fuck focus growing potatoes whatever hell Idaho Ignorant ignorant Thank good human influence. Police Chief; guy fired heartbeat insubordination say matter

if think police chief US would actually fired insubordination, anything else, delusional. 

yeah police union gonna sit back let happen. 

let's stop pretending like police chief automaton exactly they're ordered do. Perhaps they'd wear masks instead trying play tough guy... 98.5k new cases rn. 100k today  Well lets hope we're 1,000,000/day Thanksgiving that's case! Halloween bad. Thanksgiving Christmas absolutely catastrophic. fully expect us daily numbers come January. meanwhile said asshole bank robbers killing cops like playing wacka (both perpetrators)

Injured	20 Absolutely proof saying.

The reason flu vaccine effective multiple strains strains targeted specific sub-strain expected circulation - see hand, COVID-19 vaccine, effective, expected match variants -  Many also believe Biden Presidency would lead slow outbreak get public adhere mask mandates lockdowns. play devil's advocate. shapiro things bit baseless presumptions. Imagine real care perform job benefit American people. Ok, boss narcissistic asshole, gotta try job, whilst simultaneously praising jackass. Would you? care helping, price brownnosing shit stain time actually much price still extent help bit. Knowing full well quit, someone far worse fill space. would do?

I've taken call - one particular - ""You're wearing wrong"" someone walks mask pulled chin nose poking out. passive aggressive, one ever fixed mask result, make feel better.

The times I've tried address someone directly, saying gently could ""did know there's mandatory mask requirement now?"" people talked irrationally hostile worth risk safety interaction volatile irrational people. store toilet paper Belgium BAD right Dumb af  expect every day ""new record"" next weeks. 98500 Nebraska's numbers worldometer yet. gonna end 100000 sure probably minority people referring too. stress harder thing fix Mercury chalk. that?

SCIENCE!!!

Name movie quote.  Maybe end today. US healthcare system, medical industry. dramatic. would break down? stay home make extra time have. Learn something new. plenty years left everything can't now. Hillary would done much better job. Also USA, Brazil India male leaders 3 worst countries right now. You‚Äôre wrong. Wearing masks, keeping distance, maybe wearing gloves make trick-or-treating fairly safe activity.  Um littearly hosted terrorists show let recruit... Ironically think government doesn‚Äôt hide shit you, spoiler alert: did.

They knew shit coming January didn‚Äôt utter peep. look us. I'm comparing US countries. say Czech, Israel, Spain, Belgium developing happen. Whether moot point. another lockdown fact happen, government would provide workers unable work closure know much government cares actual citizens... flu good, ""vaccine imminent""

-- Turmp used cloth masks improper ppe months due shortages. still received anything beyond cloth mask made T-shirt material hospital required provide own. 

I feel like Redditors try pull ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù exposure probably people allowed work home don‚Äôt understand tone deaf sound. could family higher risk exposure already are? It‚Äôs like lecturing someone safety wearing seatbelt person forced drive motorcycle without helmet. comparing us developing countries? Sources? terms missing cases shown positivity rates......

we still missing heck lot fewer cases North Dakota overall positivity rate New York March simply many people New York. Tbh COVID sounds like strep plus respiratory damage headache. Strep left untreated also permanent damage pretty much things, anyway, minus latter two. Still shit comparison.

I'm tired COVID politicized. hard wear fucking mask. Scary part we'll probably surpass 100k cases day point Probably calls Pretty Boy Trudy something. Lean homophobia sexism. Also, NZ relatively sparsely populated island nation compared US. apples oranges. stop going create ICU beds, remember think 300 400 more. give us days. Yep, pandemic definitely shows working class divide folk's privilege self-righteousness. grinds gears people WFH basically treat folks working person fault like they're basically subhuman lesser than. wish overexaggerating heard people state associate others WFH, include people ""bubbles/pods."" Yeah, must nice bunker home indefinitely, act like badge honor lol. say someone white collar profession option WFH. Refrigerated truck business too! I‚Äôm saying see 100% mask compliance everywhere go city, like NYC see posts saying Europe anticipating second wave would worse first.

Wrong, lot posts european subs lot people talking upcoming second wave. lot people actually resenting fact preparing expecting worse. Hopefully. world live 1st world country. whole 20 million Oh shit, thought UK monarchy. also, ones full-fledged/mixed monarchies rank around 36 - 48 covid. metropolitan areas are.   front end workers (which mostly young) take 99% chance surviving infection 100% chance homeless quit. pandemic problem solved individuals acting self interest, larger scale problem. government pay wages, forbid eviction, force bosses close doors (also, ideally, help cover overhead costs small businesses too).

But Republicans gone vacation rest us die fat chance happening. imagine would cost-efficient expand existing hospitals way reduced future appropriate. Personally don‚Äôt see Covid today gone tomorrow, businesses can‚Äôt afford make assumption - that‚Äôs vast majority hospitals are. That's quite interesting way interpret data. seem ignore cumulative numbers?

If want talk comitative numbers, let's take look.
[Cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases per million    
     
[Cumulative confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million     
     even make sense. look spikes happening now, mean ""it worked""?

Based graphs, countries went thru first spike March-April experienced massive drop June till end September except US. That's mean restrictions worked whereas US kept going we're headed another peak. Everybody aware March second wave winter inevitable that's Europe right following countries higher death rate per capita US: Peru, Belgium, Spain, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico.

Are seriously cherrypicking mostly undeveloped countries South America compare US? lmao. Go take look graphs compares developed countries.     
      Following countries higher total cases per capita US: Bahrain, Qatar, Israel, Belgium, Panama, Kuwait, Armenia, Czech Republic, 
      
You're comparing small population countries US smaller US states. Let's reverse India see happens.    sounds like fucking bird box Like Cyberpunk Oh. can‚Äôt read. keep there's vaccine. Like that's it. There's cure. Like fuck. point dying, getting back normal. new normal. Get used to. I‚Äôm pretty sure Covid military opponent, would safely locked Guantanamo Bay point, ‚Äùgently pressured‚Äù give useful information complices. exaggerating thinking number minute made fearful sad. sure trying say, UK democracy too. Specifically, unitary parliamentary democracy constitutional monarchy. explained article. think miss point. patients taken countries going overwhelm hopsitals lock down.

If lock down, hospitals overwhelmed even dont help anyone.

So measure hurt us, helps countries take least little bit steam ICU. Abbott Paxton quickly becoming self parodies Showers, towels, socks, fucking sink... People need get creative. gonna home anyways. couple loads laundry. Yeah, joke point would report death Covid death. reality, apparently might reported suspicious non confirmed death Covid. yes, right now, situation critical. think everyone knows least one person infected. don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs practical enforce policy provide proof negative test boarding. policy may safest result many missing flights able travel issues obtaining test, excessive waiting periods, problems providing proof excellent reply lot salient points.

It's interesting really mention education solution though, that's something I've always thought real long-term fix problem. many countries, number students studying science dropped year year, leading increasingly science-deaf population.

An increase computer science education inclusion part required curriculum led much greater understanding technology. Science needs put front centre effect there.

Unfortunately, matter well educated science-minded population is, always refuse listen. 1918 influenza outbreak killed 50 million worldwide, protests masks, closing sports venues schools, despite science less abstract.

The average citizen's lack scientific knowledge big problem definitely gets worse science progresses (particularly speeds up), one thing always bank human pig-headedness. never change.  sure! also remember getting berated reddit telling people mask. 

I've thought beginning, proven, pretend is. default fluffy stuff. something proven true, who's gonna mad little extra safe.

Who f people running show. medical industry always inept. Thank you! US mum works grovery store got it. Since work home, cought either elevator. thing is, one else store symptoms. actually believe that. Also, everyone store thinks mum overreacting hypochonder called doctor went tests became ill. New York LA inhabitant Belgium whole. 
Pretty sure density NY could higher Belgium even inhabitant. 
I'm belgian living Brussels. never said better it. fact, pandemics wiped third people many places, probably weren't. Oh. That‚Äôs crazy. bet they're ramping production.  Agreed. also think farming animals/meat industry plays massive role pace viruses may begin develop. Might get point can‚Äôt hope keep track circulating.

I also amateur theory (who knows, maybe it‚Äôs mine) human-caused endangering species plays pretty huge role development viruses. think perhaps, viruses may act sort evolutionary defense keep certain species (maybe even species prey?) alive. Viruses bacteria descended super ancient cellular life form. humans bacteria cells. 380 trillion viruses human virome. 

Idk, since viruses require cells thing thrive, wouldn‚Äôt best interest keep original host alive? Since that‚Äôs mode able spread thrive...Which maybe viruses don‚Äôt hurt original host? 

We know we‚Äôre top food chain. wonder neglecting idea different method moving food chain. said would take long term studies performed

He look Oxford vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), already development 10 years closely related coronavirus. adenovirus technique one that's already well-established vaccine development (it's one new 'pioneering' attempts making vaccines we're seeing year), they've raised standards testing production quality (ie. correct instructions embedded adenovirus) higher ever done before. 3 testing large-scale multiple countries large outbreaks. knowledge, far incidents significant negative side effects vaccinated volunteers related vaccine trial would halted.

So: base risk vaccine appears extremely low.

How base risk COVID-19?

Well, 0.3-0.5% people die (and e.g. 5% health service collapsing get sick; see Wuhan mortality data, Bergamo lesser degree).

One study found 78% people get COVID-19 get MRI-detectable / measurable heart damage, 60% ongoing myocardial inflammation post infection too. That's **middle aged** patients **both genders**, n=100, presented **mostly asymptomatic/light symptoms** (67% recovered home without hospitalisation). finding **independent pre-existing conditions** too. 

That's **before** get considering neurological damage, kidney damage, lung damage, immune system dysfunction, loss senses, covid toes &amp; nasty clots, etc. 

If internist truly believes e.g. Oxford vaccine might represent greater overall health risk COVID-19 maybe time take break managing patients bit reading Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging Patients Recently Recovered Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Watching friends family Texas behave vs ones NYC makes glad decided move north. Getting hit hard early really shocked everyone everyone still good distincing masks. hope home state wises soon. I‚Äôm seeing small hints live, notice people wearing masks, it‚Äôs small. must remain vigilant difference persistent cough symptom simply forcing cough test. test measured second. arguing structural problems could fixed timeframe include delayed restrictions general especially nursing homes? downplaying pre- asymptomatic spread calling ""not driving factor fact Stockholm densely populated capitol regions rest Nordics

I'd say Denmark &amp; Copenhagen similar enough.

I idea Belgium fucked bad, perhaps Sweden could done better swifter response especially needed structural weaknesses. spanish flu likely mutated become less deadly. descendants still us today. 

That's good example ""herd immunity"" . people directly effected take seriously.

and even enough change views people. Prime example POTUS think hid numbers early on- much anymore.

What mean ""early on""? evidence this, ""I think"" without factual basis?

I've never, never seen anyone proper research topic intellectually honest saying purposedly hid fudged numbers.

Because *evidences* have, ironically, points fact didn't. Highlights article:

""The team used 2,500 Covid-associated recordings, along 2,500 recordings randomly selected collection balance dataset. used 4,000 samples train AI model. remaining 1,000 recordings fed model see could accurately discern coughs Covid patients versus healthy individuals.""

""The model identified 98.5 percent coughs people confirmed Covid-19, those, accurately detected asymptomatic coughs.""

""The team working incorporating model user-friendly app, FDA-approved adopted large scale could potentially free, convenient, noninvasive prescreening tool identify people likely asymptomatic Covid-19. user could log daily, cough phone, instantly get information whether might infected therefore confirm formal test."" ‚ÄúTask Force‚Äù wrong, like 720k Considering many reinfections know asymptomatic missed point like **seriously fuckin didn‚Äôt get it** lol checked top 10 countries covid except UK forms democracy. They're using condoms mistresses. That's secret abortions for. sure hell fucking wives closed Walibi gonna better ;) fault sides, HI gov worker probably saw negative result sent code, tried enter somewhere supervisor saw it, noticed testing site approved.

But first dumb thing done family. given approved testing places go asked another state... like, would that? Hawaii already told go? 

 surprise went outside approved testing places test result approved end. 

They come kid like Mommy says, go whine Daddy try get another answer. throw science window feels? Clean shaven.

Maybe Monday 0% growth start seeing turn back next week.

Fingers crossed. odd, love cali we've lockdown, many people saying lives terrible now...but feel like nothing changed haha, apparently life style quarantine. weekly averages. test results several days ago.

He‚Äôs using power office stay court. hope mob protect help people lockdowns come. know. That's true Fauci! life normal 1995. Lol Yes, it‚Äôs dependent healthcare available. flood hospitals, mortality rates go people can‚Äôt get tmr treatment need. So, yes, simple. reduced testing strategy week. FHM says ""Statistiken visar antalet personer med bekr√§ftad covid-19 som avlidit, oavsett think comes from. maybe clarified somewhere, could wrong. 

Then death crosschecked 2 register, carvictims removed. takes whole done.

One socialstyrelsen report deaths doctor says covid. Doesnt matter person tester not. requires info registers, compiled sent socialstyrelsen thats slower. 

But statistically people die caraccidents confirmed covid doesnt matter (statistically, still horrible course). 

In end Swedens statistics seems accurate (comparatible). still good argument mandate. logic, laws people going break anyway? That's small percentage doses. 80k reported cases, mind you! saying right now, doctor Russia tell right hospitals overflowing construct field ones. official numbers may bc officials want pay hazard pay doctors word broader definition too, doesn‚Äôt refer specific group diseases. Serious question...

If vaccines pass trials...then what?

I know probably happen does.

Are living like forever? deaths thing worry me. think lot long-term impact health. many people potential chronic health problems resulting virus. fact disproportionately impacting communities color uninsured (of both), wrecks me. felt like one gave fuck us before...it's worse now. Still lock here. opened parks yesterday. Right winter! try optimistic possible infuriating. many friends parties weekend. head heart ache. 

Why open parks right sick season pandemic? look 20 years now? Surely able teach children differently one sees problem way handled. 99% surviving rate tho Every time go grocery store can't wait get hell can't imagine working times Weeks probably. Depends lot factors. rooky numbers wait lot people pushing red vs. blue, etc., media perpetuates pandemic. thought think reason people hospitalized rate related fact America unhealthy ever been? God, nearly half population obese! mean, new disease would disastrous overweight, poor health population. see people care health enough want lockdown spent previous 30 40 years destroying inside out. get COVID vaccine line bro know single clinic, hospital, facility *actually* using N95s properly. 

That is: single-use, throw away first time take off. 

The sad thing is, without increase domestic production, *we can't.* Making OSHA place regulations help fact simply enough production, even now, month 8 pandemic.

Pre-COVID, indications N95 use. using maybe 10 20 per year. Now, wanted use properly, would need around 10 20 per *day.* need 365x mask production prayer meeting need. never come close. NO

any questions? add that. aunt doctor Russia can't get tested hospital claims ""covid free"" avoid paying doctors hazard pay. hospital overflowing covid patients they're refusing get test even though literally pnuemonia. able get medicine grandparents covid could region specific. doubt getting worse. shitty situation going down? what‚Äôs idea? much misinformation covid..

Don‚Äôt tell haven‚Äôt herd know, went home town 2 weeks ago one wearing masks. going ask wonder calculate recovered vs current cases? going back checking everyone see they're better? It‚Äôs went essentials transform halloween another carneval? dress nurse doctor ""trick treeeeat"" sweetest voice wearing mask disinfectant handy. kids fun, everyone wore f-in mask. lockdowns, general, economically painful everyone. hard imagine economic incentive keep things closed. vast majority people care vaccine publically available. must can't afford ""fine"" stolen us gunpoint. Please think everyone see mask WANTS wear one. live colder climate I'm worried winter sets everyone socialize indoors, very, wear mask home. CDC supposed able quarantine entire regions country. already happened hit regions last weekend without major issues. worried getting infected virus harmful could spread others it‚Äôs harmful? makes lot sense vaccine gets build antibodies.. infected body remembers bring bad boyz fuck virus. vaccine kill virus bro. body 100% use blueprint vaccine. care. STILL unconstitutional. body, choice. sick nonsense. Also, let see study variables ACTUAL data, data chose use conclusions. Also, fk off. States report time. Results trickle hours day. number gets recorded tracking site depends cutoff hours using. Worldometers reset around 2100 EST every day. course week, numbers add roughly same. 9 million cases now, number today 90,000. Fridays tend highest numbers. might 95,000 tomorrow. think we'll hit 100,000 yet, looks almost certain Thursday Friday next week. especially bad time pandemic fatigue kick in...yet seems like way many people USA (and countries well) starting get lax taking preventative measures CDC doctors saying cloth mask best ineffective worse making us sick? Thank Russian comments. Best wishes country USA.

Here Ohio officially log 2600 infections per day, see it. people think real. fear incredibly overblown. government tells can't buy cocaine. tyranny? 

I'm saying looking back made sense, effort/intent help other. seems many care that. Emperor orange would never that. would regardless many people die. realize NY/NJ got ravaged March April, virus probably January-February completely unsuspected. tore population nursing homes even knew hit us. lost lot people we've learned it, adopted masks shut even ability test treat thing.

What embarrassing rest US blueprint happens prepare testing infrastructure, better protocols, therapeutics, know transmits WEAR DAMN MASK still spreading like crazy, excuse except selfishness idiocy. Flu also starting go around. It‚Äôs casedemic I've trying tell everyone manage expectations, get shouted it.

Well, are.

This actually makes feel better jab, seems realistic preventative. going cause lot people melt freak still can't things want do.

I suspect virus going burn combination mutation (limited) herd immunity full-blown preventative vaccine. medical treatments improve, situation become infected better year today. ....are going cite BS study ACTUALLY showed death rate lower hospitals overrun?

Seriously, cite something. Show evidence, please. nice, thank you! Well written joke, bro. Obviously el paso letting people 5 hours 5pm. assholes declaring NY got cases control reached herd immunity? basically rich get hurt sick. Gotcha. Worldometers shows nearly 550,000 new cases globally Oct 29th. That‚Äôs average 6 people every second! Thanks. Here‚Äôs article points [CDC national mask wearing way back June. 

[This recent Washington Post article every single state‚Äôs reported mask wearing rate. 

-	Only two states 70% - Wyoming 63% South Dakota 65% 
-	There eleven states 90%

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The vast majority Americans wearing masks months. sick redditors pretending tiny, loud minority represents everyone. would take 2 months without additional measures reach level. 

I meannnnnnn say half country thinks hoax. keep seeing pills showing things like majority country want national mask mandate etc. dumb voices amplified, they're majority half us. fake indian accent, get ticket new york mumbai stop frankfurt. come on. /J literally wouldn't. clue heck people think national mandate would do. Sally wants go visit Carol home evening want wear masks, nothing going stop happening. cannot fine someone getting together friends homes wearing masks. wow insane. stimulus? people going do, unemployed starve? max time limit claim state unemployment, varies state course fed unemployment checks ran out.

and essential workers like deliveries/transportation, grocery people, still work..

the solution hospitals build hospitals hire doctors. alternative. So, stance political - Atlas, there's way claim point view medically coherent - instead saying politics trust nature response.

But again, part problem dealing virus may mean lockdowns, people can't stomach matter political proclivities them. Yes, yes did. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ 2021 starting early see... Here‚Äôs link source study couple key parts pertaining everyone currently unclear whether variant spreading transmission advantage virus whether high incidence Spain followed dissemination tourists sufficient explain rapid rise multiple countries.

Also currently unclear whether variant affects disease severity. Definitely something pay attention though research conducted. 2k day pretty rough. either good reading comprehension troll already answered imagine many PSA's mask wearing wear masks correctly political commercials, would go long ways getting people wear masks more. assuming average failure rate 10%, 90% people wearing masks consistently public. So, mean masks social distancing working? Yes, general point still valid. hope next couple months go better expect. Best luck mom! lucky loving careful considerate person life Nobody wants lock again. hospitals ICUs start filling up, longer authorities choose. I'd say odds good lock coming sooner later. nothing continues done, numbers high almost certainly lock downs Thanksgiving. incredible country Europe US anything pro-active stop obvious impending health disaster. see numbers grow (cases, hospitalizations, deaths). Yet, numbers hit ceiling force hands, politicians anything. Contrast Asian countries Western ones like New Zealand Australia. think lock going happen anyway, wait death rates unacceptable move schedule forward get done sooner, less health &amp; economic impact way. data suggesting vaccines closer 80-90% effective well minimum requirement. take vaccinate everyone. Also I‚Äôm sure one two doses required. Vaccination 225 million people take bit. actually is. EU country, politically co-operative trading block nations. nation earth worse numbers. Might long term killer causes long term damages. Less people dying getting seriously ill makes spread easier virus harder detect. ehen dangerous becomes thing tjat cannot get rid take anyone temporarily weak immune system.

But many possible factors. GODFUCkiNGDAMNIT.  W F You‚Äôll never able mandate mask compliance private residences. 

But, wouldn‚Äôt wearing masks EVERYWHERE public stop people passing virus, would stop people giving someone private? basically USA confirmed cases single day China total? mind-boggling, what's crazy many Americans starting accept new grim reality. especially bad time pandemic fatigue set Lockdowns makes GOP look bad, make stop. Ffs. Use real source. mods busy enough here. 

Also, learn basic science. Yes actual asymptomatic people contagious. making everyone wear mask ""might"" sick...  something 99.9% survival rate Also events thousands unmasked people. Careful, sort thing ruled [unconstitutional  !Remindme 3 weeks It‚Äôs like watching slow motion car wreck. I‚Äôm wearing seatbelt two hands wheel, see buffoons swerving throwing beer cans window?

Shits gonna hit fan can‚Äôt look away. Later might keep thoughts prayers, since can‚Äôt control assholes, I‚Äôm watching run others road crash burn. There's new Covid cases US last 3 days, Canada 8 months US. 80k early number; Worldometer reporting 91k. Today's worldwide cases +545,903. realize unpopular opinion Stupid American coming peaceüôå Great first half Europe, thought covid beat! You‚Äôll get em next time I‚Äôm sure moon! lawyer, see constitutional issues federal mask mandate, however, perfect way would federal government tie COVID-related emergency funding, similar so-called ‚Äúnational drinking age.‚Äù Withhold significant percentage funding states don‚Äôt mask mandate. You‚Äôll get night. Election day great. 100000k daily cases. seen numbers like folks. Never mind, read post, mild symptoms now. Get this, lady know, son tested positive come home school. kids get sniffles. Tonight, says feeling great decided take kids trick treating anyway... also anti mask. Oh corrupt motherfucker needs take long walk short pier. *hey look guys idiot* tomorrow delaying payments Covid cases- hospitals bill anything else.  


They cut contracts labs high positive results.  


They aren‚Äôt teaching properly administer nasal swab tests.  


My father stroke Warfarin- also found multiple micro-clots heart. couldn‚Äôt explain it- switched medication, refused run blood test Covid initial nasal swab negative. talked friend works billing hospital, explained issue. code Covid, don‚Äôt get paid.  


Another friend heart attack, neurologist told ignoring clotting issues Covid- tried talk doctors ignored him.  


I 50, dad 70. last four months 2 friends heart attacks two strokes close group 14. It‚Äôs fucking scary. friend cardioligist ER thinks missing half cases. said peak happening concern getting people treated, seeing continuing cases. continuing spike heart attacks strokes, people meds preventing them.  


The tests good- we‚Äôve known long time. Hopkins reported nasal swabs, best day (8 days exposure), 80% accurate. best results- 80%. magic day, before, accuracy declines. reporting results, report repeat negatives repeat positives. So, you‚Äôre sick - get test, negative, you‚Äôre still sick, get test- negative. finally go hospital- first day, negative, second day positibe. run test again, positive- 3 negative, 1 positive. negatives person get counted, one positive per person. That‚Äôs insane.  


They tell staff administering tests ‚Äònot make patient uncomfortabl‚Äòenough- means swab isn‚Äôt actually going nasal cavity, nostril, it‚Äôs held count ten- it‚Äôs quick easy! - missing virus.  


sorry rant- frustrated.  


vote. already said grandpas grandmas sacrifice 'economy'. think favor people trying die. people won‚Äôt follow... Struck Texas Supreme Court 3... 2... education teach freedom also responsibility. unlimited freedom. People get freedom take responsibility. Trump said wants everything open hospitals open record amounts business, best kind business, covid curing kind. Operation warp speed insert rambling continue. Oh please.. opinion genomic data?

That's bit least understand. symptoms?  math add up? US 80k Italy 23k today, we're already 91k two countries. PA dashboard chart updates count day occurred. Comparing counts yesterday today indicates 44 deaths reported today occurred on:

Generally using 7d count consistent single day, PA Department Health releases Friday. numbers risen past 4 weeks 98 129 149 168, also lag bit.

Tomorrow‚Äôs number added last 6 days total 137 correlates period stable cases mid late September case rate nearly tripled. original piece based seem available still think makes point. OP I‚Äôd curious see it. going work Halloween party. First time seeing person since March. week several us 2 3 people removed person positive cancelled party. Things spiking predicted think many people done ignoring it. It‚Äôs gonna bad couple months think. Even colds horrible. Still worth shutting societies them. one point illegal narcotic readily available. products mentioned. 

So able buy cocaine tyranny? relatives South Carolina told recently governor announced removing mask mandate restaurant capacity limits. Around Chicago wear masks. state go relaxed people proud superspreader.

It impact you, cares? Yeah. Normally happens halloween falls weekday (except friday) places. Obviously can‚Äôt answer every child school son 7 wearing mask day school without issues weeks now. takes two masks change lunch. Along spares needed. don‚Äôt swap masks way don‚Äôt swap glasses coats. know mask share it. Really isn‚Äôt big issue. ""media,"" Worldometer - literally statistics. one reducing human lives ""so what"" American Federation Teachers involved? OSHA bearing school environments. share reasonable source would give rational thinking human reason believe there's inflated numbers presented here? inflation, mean least 8% miss numbers. ""there one guy died motorcycle accident said covid!!!!!!"" story. reputable article peer-reviewed research paper scientific document would great. It‚Äôs sad I‚Äôm surprised all. Texas, Georgia, several state governments obstructing local ordinances intended control COVID throughout pandemic.

And emphasize horrible is, take look El Paso‚Äôs surging COVID hospitalizations. already several-fold higher summer done challenge trial. LOL no. get us agree wear masks. One side already would go along deplorable dirtbag greater good. Cult 45 whatever told reality tv show joker. osha great keeping safe someone drinking coffee work station..but pandemic much. least I‚Äôm science denier. believe climate change either? maybe haven‚Äôt taken math class since 10th grade aren‚Äôt able *understand* science. Holy crap.


That's takeaway?

This you, Einstein. Read again, without poindexter ego blocking reading comprehension.

EDIT: ya need hint, paragraph 1, sentence 2. Exclusive: Americans don‚Äôt want innocent people die. Corona's mutating. There's new strain ripping Europe. 

The people in, greater chance it'll mutate. 

Herd Immunity ""strategy"" ensures it'll maximum chance mutations. 

The ***only*** way ""herd immunity"" works without vaccine intentionally infect entire planet time. month it'll burnt gone forever. 

But guarantee you, start trying force people get Covid involuntarily... lol. Oh man. read government said pandemic ended! Italy national outpouring grief awareness slammed early first wave? dedicated front page sections major newspapers running full color obituaries dozens pages. reached rest world raise awareness warn others happening, asked help.

The indifference repeated everywhere.  Californian hasn‚Äôt Disneyland long, long time. I‚Äôm ok that, even though love parks. love everything California: beaches, forests, mountains, cities, deserts, parks politics; love right didn‚Äôt throw open cases went down. mom says I‚Äôm strong right places though feel 20 years younger!! think hid numbers early on- much anymore. safer one delivery person drop 100 pizza's doorstep's 100 people walk restaurant pick pizza. 

This goes everything, pizza. Won‚Äôt surprise it‚Äôs tomorrow Saturday would allow see certain vaccine works better ones approved first really ""trust"", taking stab motivation question. Pertinently, think shit response terms. can't give society culture another year, things fundamental needs cost greater whatever costs don't. I'm shocked someone printed crapload ""from"" signs, planted one every ""Run"" ""Forest"" sign. think gender-typing.. Like seriously, saying vagina makes people lead better pandemic? also research leaders regards race religion - height weight - blood type? real stable genius say it'll go away gets warm? government activities, including voting campaigning, deemed essential allowed. thought europe locked properly beat covid? sound like great superspreader. proud narcissist.

I would hate idiot governor knows yet still costs 18k deaths less 3 months. already mask mandate. can't police people further. wow üôè I've person visits doctors since June. always ask Covid symptoms, check temp, etc... 

But now, they've added asking recently tested waiting results.

It seems ridiculous even ask question.

It's super obvious people really understand need quarentine getting tested know results. Otherwise, results tested 2-3 days ago really useful accurate.

I really think needs stronger information &amp; messaging it. 

My fiance's mom wants us get together holidays &amp; going everyone get tested-- trust they'll quarentine time get tested time meet up, going join them. Except story someone allowed plane without test results.

Are paying attention conversation hand? Wishing best! dare people El Paso try die? challenge that. *Commentary saying something bad China negative karma, god forbid saying something bad especial country.* much damn sub doom gloom. Take look like 90% posts page, take look vast majority comments....all negative. fucking depressing. like people enjoy damn pessimistic. like want us go ahead write wills we're gonna die this.

We need positivity, terms posts comments too.

Edit: already i'm downvoted. Amazing. say Covid-19 hoax? say ""jUsT fLu""? No. believe 110% something need take seriously. get sick tired lots people sub doom gloom. want maybe little optimistic?? I‚Äôm also curious response be. Texas GOP might focused voter suppression moment care... Sure, situation like would fairly persuasive. think 99%+ experts agree Fauci's assessment herd immunity? so, why? seen reported; I've seen assumed.

Of course, badly people get treated come media narrative influences many people willing so. That's Barrington Declaration dissenting opinions, even though fairly high chance incorrect, ought received measure respect.

If well-established preexisting body literature merits lockdowns coping pandemics would also convincing.   you‚Äôre comparing already illegal narcotic board games gardening materials? Like said another comment, I‚Äôm debate anyone change minds. I‚Äôm simply responding question, providing insight. Isn‚Äôt same
Idiot brushed long term Covid damage ‚Äúmold lungs‚Äù?! I‚Äôm wondering November 4th magic also work Europe South America. ""the Darwin award"", shitheads idiots spreading innocents wear damn mask. 

Yet, like us mask up, peoples' sons, mothers, siblings. I'm angry right need stop acting like people side. put better ever could. well halloween definitely kill Trust me, many comments Facebook article basically saying word word. 
The rest say ‚ÄúFAKE NEWS‚Äù TRUMP2020‚Äù oh Trump memes. That‚Äôs nearly 250k last 3 days  People El Paso - toilet paper bread flying shelves? am. I‚Äôm 30, based data virus *isn‚Äôt* big deal. literally math. science - like Trump *deny science* ? send prayers I'm atheist best wishes really know would feel good expanding 'gig' industry, pretty much invented scam companies essentially full time employees rights benefits, yeah shit corona reasons order delivery eating restaurant dumbest shit since march. moment saw queue people waiting get McDonalds, wearing masks, chatting, mixing looking window I'd see families sitting cubicles, separated 6ft plexiglass knew bad idea. Would surprise know lot fame came appearing comedy programme? What's worse looked complete bumbling idiot it. elected him. Back March, seemed like one would traveling long time, hotels town stood vacant desperate, thinking use people sick enough stay hospital want go home infect others.  nurses trained staff around take care them, bring good, etc. anything incentivize people stay inside week two. Also maybe offer one hotels downtown hospital staff only, need go home day, sleep comfortably somewhere nearby instead wasting time commuting to/from work. say equal. Taking something someone says twisting something hyperbolic imaginary ""gotcha"". Thank that. love Reddit too. Normal people coughing time. Maybe dry throat swallowed something wrong way. No, I'm familiar. Probably you. Thanks condescending attitude though. Cute. Right.  states counties data make available.  article smacks politics conspiracy theory. links sources data? Guess I'll trust know talking about. /s think made 20 million stopped what? Bankruptcy lawyers business booming well! line get tested seems riskier situation put here. science-based. put point main issue covid. bad enough cannot afford nothing (people die, people long term covid) mild enough take risk (Most cases asymptomatic, ""flu"") 

Mask mandates stay home order minor inconvenience compared delivering rushed botched vaccine. 

That said, point one need check kids react vaccine better 1000 volunteers finding latter things working planned. thanks There's anti maskers everywhere, especially Texas Florida. Yet El Paso southern Texas getting hit much harder forced lock multiple long stretches time. buddy Hank looking healthy. Hank, ya? Reminds Tiberian Sun‚Äôs midnight sale. Good times. Self imposed quarantine week getting that. Hey know you‚Äôre going lot right now, wanted say best wishes family, healthy take care yourself, best wishes ‚ù§Ô∏è What's good craft store alternative? I'm willing go online things can't seem find like one name store. Eh. good job state like Ohio lot open space would hard local police state highway patrol respond. people unsure status outstanding test allowed endanger others?

Why allowed? question irrelevant. fact is, allowed. 

People unsure status pending tests, allowed fly. airline policy also Hawaii's policy. Everyone plane comply policy. Abbott wants number 1. Texas number one daily cases deaths now. guess he's trying beat new york. everything else, raving lunatics scream mask mandate violates constitutional freedoms.  
Indians probably religion obsessed folks side world, part view minor discomfort wearing masks global health crisis cardinal sin. Well, yes. gathered much. Lol. Also sort assumed since catch one every year two years.

I asking covid expected behave way. understand coronavirus, since studies showing antibodies falling 8 months-does mean covid shorter immunity timeline coronaviruses? definitively 12-24 months? something vary based virus rather family. know people kids covid went treak treating tonight... 

This sounds completely made up. taken right instead left. soldier headed desert weeks training going fun town go. Testing two weeks movement establishing quarantine two weeks pretty foolish made tests largely meaningless.

Better go ahead modify training allow larger ventilated barracks, time Don/doff PPE. 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, experienced number COVID-19 cases since arriving National Training Center Fort Irwin, California, thought won‚Äôt derail planned rotation, unit official unit departed home base Fort Bliss, near El Paso, Texas, one week ago. Since then, installation step restrictions, including barring off-base dining trick-or-treating Halloween, El Paso struggles surge COVID-19 cases.  tests around 30% accuracy. know many details really, I'm doctor anything, understand based ""infectivity"" whatever called - basically chance infect another person, whether covid. basically test ""negative"", may still positive next week, chances infect anyone ""no symptoms"" phase small - least that's say. Wouldn‚Äôt make ‚Äúfun fact‚Äù history books 100 years...  Columbus, OH. indoors around people maskless except one time since march crises really show vast superiority CCP regards governmental power, agility, adherence scientific guidance overall intelligent government policy. think 2020 remembered year Chinese succeeded West primary force world. There's lot things worry about. One thing PTSD going big deal doctors nurses working ICU's. compare war soil quite accurate. Yes exactly. resting pulse usually around 50, 65 70 days. Also heart rate variability (a good signal body stress) indicating stressed. breathing also 18/s instead usual 14. couldn‚Äôt feel subjectively, fever.

I absolutely agree data could useful tracking/preventing illness. that‚Äôs done ethically question way pay grade haha what? types business owners pushing stay open, golden parachutes yachts jets ride pandemic in. Again, think tone deaf assume fucking hospital would protect staff correctly (excuse language shit like makes really angry). Please forgive people like who, place privilege, assume modern healthcare system equipped properly protect workers.

I work one Germany's biggest hospitals shortages there, (and probably colleagues) can't fathom direct contact COVID-19 patients self-bought ppe. would probably refuse call sick. mean, 8 months Corona ffs. bad infrastructure still shortages? 

Sorry rant late stage capitalism bullshit making healthcare workers choose financial security/letting people die endangering health fucked beyond belief makes blood boil.

Where live, may ask (I'm assuming UK)? hope situation improves soon. wish best. 30-40% American fertile soil shit. Trunk Treating

I look too. Apparently something people go parking lot decorate trunks car hand candy. Kind like trick treat tailgate? million tests day. virus spreads sufficiently, test positivity rates 10% perfectly conceivable. enough catch cases course higher positivity likelihood cases we'll miss. seem pretty f'ed. might hit herd immunity christmass. experts said would lucky vaccine year, possibly two. experts warned pandemic last least, based past experience, 18 - 24 months. 

If someone posts ""moving goal posts"" someone listening right people. Science politics. Imagine governor working safety acknowledging hospitals full. operate profit lots it. Stop blabbering know shit. everywhere, even last village dead end road probably had/has cases now. 

Look map, Paris higher big difference like spring Okay question. I‚Äôm 23 still quite young, H1N1 thing, (I actually caught H1N1, lol) people fight much hoax, conspiracy, real? don‚Äôt remember much certainly don‚Äôt remember ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù business around it... Thanks! encouraging actually dining buying take out? didn‚Äôt really say article. I'd managed hold family strict security ever since first announcement nationwide lockdown back March. We've bare essentials delivered safe distance too, yeah, living West Bengal trying maintain Social Distancing part preventative measures major pain bum.

Last month, parents came sudden fever never seemed die down, came right dad decided take sudden morning stroll without mask on. us tested negative Covid, thankfully, absolutely terrifying situation want go again. quite surprised exactly state charters actually say. Yep. dad spent three months ICU ventilator GBS. reason moved patient admitted viral meningitis. read link. clearly stated theory proven science.  individually wrapped candy plastic baggies put foot apart front porch. Kids walked up, greeted opposite end porch, grabbed candy left. Yes Belgium serious trouble. heart goes them. American would starve without fast food. may essential service have. Yeah, would worry oxygen levels, body (hearth, lung) compensate. question much damage (or if) added strain cause long-term? everyone commits together, get back ""normal"" sooner.

And therein lies problem... American intervention necessary close bonfire night? contagious virus.  Keeping people locked isolated slow spread make virus go away.  soon lockdown isolation lessens spread goes up.   science based fact.  scientists, like Dr Osterholm, said much back spring.   Lockdowns buy time develop treatments vaccines lessen load hospitals, people tolerate limited time. half wonder wtf people thinking? 100% mask compliance area's school district. None little kids big kids problem. nice living civilized world. (NorthEast US) Halloween High turnout election Thanksgiving Black Friday Christmas New Years combined person schools 3 weeks next 8 weeks + much cooler weather across country forcing people inside spreads easier, next 60 days.

The snowball running hill towards winter warning months. That's theory. Science based?

This problem stupidity media. fucking idiot wrote article. science behind lack PPE science behind 6t social distancing. predictable elected president today, would do? Netflix. would compare country specific provinces? That's like comparing Germany Florida. detest man. Him, Cruz Hot Wheels ...... (not sure sub rules... fill blank scene favorite horror movie) **will** reckoning. immune colds year catching one lol. 8,000,000,000 population minus 20,000,000 7,980,000,000 go. Wonder even work, so, long would last. Informal gatherings people following guidelines. making false comparisons, arguing good faith. Maybe governor piece shit... lot people go church mainly get good feeling it. think explains part resistance ""killing vibe"" wearing masks distancing, part church leadership members. instead view worship something important do, regardless much enjoy not, COVID precautions (even means worshiping home) big deal. majority Americans wanted different president 2016. realize need put /s lol. Yikes pointed informal gatherings, especially among young people. ""Whether come control open question,"" Galea said. ""It's fluctuating day day."" Oh god think seasonal coronavirus colds immunity lasts 12-24 months? adults catch 3 year, kids catch 8. easy choices here. shitty insurance screwed. poor good one, rich covered grants... right here? Yeah ... still don‚Äôt care.  NZ smaller, homogenous population, torn apart foreign interests. Comparing NZ US disingenuous. lot research.. see 

[worse second Asymptomatic loose term.  know someone thinks may it. took cough suppressant every two hours week ibuprofen daily keep fevers threshold necessary show work. Didn‚Äôt get tested Covid report. I‚Äôm sure got others infected it. Wild West seems biggest bullhorns guns make rules. Thats dude getting paid big time really anything said mess positivity rates, do. 

For example count every negative test individual, 1 positive test even test positive once. wonder use advantage. Like, seeing there's way detect COVID-19 urine stool tests developed domestic usage. 

If conclusions study believed, would probably *huge* implications way test virus, could solve testing problems, etc. Ya mean surgical mask going interrupt flow oxygen co2. 

She's probably higher risk wear mask pre existing lung issues. 

Hope shes good. here. Love cozy house. already worked home COVID nothing really changed. given us opportunity decorate fix house garden even enjoy space. thing miss travel. mini RV could still travel carefully worth risk wait. That's added audio file pretty pictures. you‚Äôre equating rule restricting gatherings save lives pandemic Nazi rules genocide ethnic group? guess you‚Äôre evil person. Maybe aren‚Äôt breathing properly? would spread ridiculous myth? would believe it? We've never still lockdown Germany. fact, time even less strict earlier year. Bars, Gyms, Restaurants etc. close, people 2 households can't gather, that's it. Schools Universities still open, public transport overcrowded, Home Office mandatory even possible. Lockdown means can't go except absolute essentials, schools closed etc. NZ !RemindMe 20 days It‚Äôs essential people business Hard hold treats though. Much better get dead kid go zombie - plus you‚Äôve finally got perfect set-up eating brains neighbours dislike. dodge pesky prions! Ahh yes, liberal bastion is... *checks notes* ...El Paso, Texas. Yep, graph shows Brazil worse death rate US. Eh scientist done forever. Southern Oregon still predominantly maskless shit show. 200 million people do? incredibly small group people that, like polls, way represent views populace?

As usual, latter. country that? BRANDON/HODOR 2020 called excess mortality, covid sent roof, everywhere. God forbid there's corrugated cardboard main pharmacy infection control issue... Meanwhile COVID ramping again... I'm tired man. (Cyberpunk) 2077 
:P speak generally nurse worked smaller (~200 bed facilities) large facilities, ICUs general always run pretty full. ICUs mega huge hospital essentially permanently overrun COVID. opened another permanent full size medical ICU overnight two months COVID - fortunate organization seems unlimited resources. 

And yes, constantly struggle 100% capacity even second 30 bed MICU, top 100 ICU beds have. ICU routinely run full one open bed, risky specialized care units provide - need beds available patients. people seem second infections worse first. ADE happen everyone. right-wing facebook propaganda. 

The FBI warned kinda shit. Also live Louisville. beds 70% state. It‚Äôs looking good here. hope grandmother okay. vaccines

-Abraham Lincoln, probably ""we're rounding turn"" feel like lot people forget turns usually spin out. That's America heading nothing changes.  many people agree you! piddling $200 per paycheck 2 weeks March company offered us keep working helped us miserable Summer, - comes Fall Winter heels! 

When overrun positive cases, supply chains fall apart again, shutdowns finally happen, firing line. help us? playbook coordinated national response authorizes marshals resources across federal agencies. Test trace one small piece it. Localized shutdowns already happening. See: El Paso.

I hope areas high case positivity rates same. Winnning! face it, pandemic slow heck, vaccine reaches last bumfuckvillesomewhere ther hundreds million infected recovered speculate death count. ... dress sexy doctor Halloween. suits wearer, starer. Sounds like stomach flu short lasting ( less one day ) stomach intestinal virus. What? thought guys already rounded corner, saved 2 million lives beat pandemic?

Oh also guys done better countries.

How anyone believe anything said beyond me. go look US slightly caess India twice many deaths. US near test/pop but... Compared others US far lore cares cases tests... Death per population great well.

How anyone think handled well far beyond me. try blame China want, China also early warning rest world shit incoming many countries take seriously enough. Lol, England Belgium, getting slammed right now. country mandatory scanning signs every business workplacem public parks scan signs it‚Äôs number three thing then. two whole weeks early voting... Meanwhile, Indiana, getting people cover noses (and sometimes mouths) continues difficult. 'Murica! president encouraged wreckless behavior get vote! People? *Pah.* guess realistically 2022 people vaccinated. Remindme! 2 weeks 1.5% population normally dies every year, mostly old age. additional .1% (in months) premature deaths, average, what? Maybe 10 15 years premature? Multiply understand real impact. hairpin turn, heading back direciton. know 31% number cases tested positive right? Well ideally Biden would push 6-8 week hard lockdown burn cases, contact trace. know I'm stating obvious some, wonder things bad first wave's peak, testing capabilities reach figures first time around.

Might also mean death count per case lower time.  socializing year hurt anyone care all. Family EVERYTHING here, common families large weekly gatherings Grandma's house Tio's food together. gatherings stop, still stopping. addition, I've seen multiple large parties going neighborhood. 

I'm really surprised spike. Hospitalisations are, IMO, much solid indicator case numbers good/bad things compared spring, highly variable factors like access tests, test quality etc.

Location X might 500% cases April, 2,000% (and accurate) tests carried out, X may actually better now.

On hand, road Location hospitalisations 150% April simply know things gone pear-shaped. I'm sorry must've read this...what book it? see lot people saying large majority wearing masks.

Have New York recently? work pass uncomfortable amount people wearing mask/wearing properly daily. MANHATTAN charge means nothing, prosecutor needs decide bring case finally jurry need find guilty anyone really believe Obama, US would done well South Korea now?

Does anyone really believe would better right pandemic response team strategy maintained President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama dismantled narcissist? worries translating Polish comments YouTube. There's lot idiots Poland.

They're paranoid right wing government using exaggerating epidemic restrict freedoms. political. 

There's posts claiming flu, 80% tests false positive, people hospital COVID-19 they're reasons got diagnosed virus. Others saying people die heart attacks strokes, worry that. Spotted comments claimed COVID-19 Flu combined figures. comments said company makes RT-PCR machines owned Bill Gates inaccurate.

I know YouTube comment section attracts special kinda stupid nearly comments. lot Polish news videos 80%-90% voted, like one announced 300 deaths. rising cases us happen soon enough... You‚Äôre welcome! hope don‚Äôt ever go it.  Holy shirt. chart horrifying. That's China basically made everyone without phone end straw., need scan code else can't enter, can't get app reads code without registering prior. Plenty people coming going europe elsewhere. also porous border partner Covid south.  Ahh ok, bad.  favor, cause it‚Äôll enlightening you.

Go face mirror... hold napkin front face, napkin, thin want... SPIT napkin

Look mirror... see anything? would legitimately doubt it...

Now remove napkin spit again. 

See anything?

Exactly.

This virus largely transmitted *respiratory droplets*.... essentially you‚Äôre talking, spew shit... incessantly.

The face masks reduce spread respiratory droplets.

This shit isn‚Äôt airborne. It‚Äôs spread air wind wildly. case, you‚Äôd right, 100% fact.

This spreads droplets. masks stop spread *droplets*.

This legitimately basic concept able understand. Go test yourself.... seriously. You‚Äôll immediately see difference. passengers knew risks, infected person followed guidelines. passengers blindsided unexpected news. might well sue went bar later found someone else Covid. Save-a-buck millionaires penny wise pound foolish R party. Ike rolling grave. Cool?

I'm LA. first time got tested May, took week.

I got tested Covid scare office almost month ago took 2 days.

üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Regardless takes days hours, time period critical that's ultimately point hate report bad news, [Belgium posted almost 24,000 cases last 24 someone warned us thing dangerous!  Lets ignore Singapore/China average American worker received one-time check $1200 **IN APRIL**. 

There nothing since then. 

Our country massively anti-welfare sides aisle, usual right far worse. nation‚Äôs ‚Äúleft‚Äù candidate proudly tweets [Americans aren‚Äôt looking well, chances nations working-class population - especially disproportionately minority workers - going get fucked recourse.

Go back watch Biden Harris‚Äô debates. answer ‚Äúwhat would better Trump coronavirus‚Äù **NEVER** ‚Äúgive people money‚Äù. food bank lines wrap around miles area, become commonplace sight since summer. 

Tens millions people lost lose healthcare yes, country still ties access doctors employment yes, Joe Biden Kamala Harris single-payer plan (which, argued coronavirus hit, people like plans already employers laying off). 

Literally mean literally impartial observer tell Trump metastatic cancer. telling people fuck fend bailing Fortune 500s financial institutions is, unfortunately, thing parties agree (besides war budget). Joe rogan gonna pissed Bacterium much, much larger speak heavier virus hence would expect much harder infect Air. Plus dosage matters. many particles needed infection? HIV needs lot. Hepatitis-c close 1. Remindme! One month choose stay home without entire city shutting down. know hard lot redditors understand, us jobs. already lost 0.1% entire population

This insane put like that. Taking Vitamin deficient number 1 thing people protect besides masks &amp; distancing...there ton studies showing massive benefits That's assume, unfortunately people truly care much like to. 

Worse case scenario feel comfortable leave suppose.

Hope they're going take things seriously though ‚ô•Ô∏è

Ty feedback (hospitals) get paid code COVID? Insurance companies? Medicare? I'm confused even happening... pay cash, help much better KC metro. pay cash everything even pizza.  Sure, wear mask, everyone vaccinated, dont force others wear mask. That‚Äôs curbed virus... financial burdens virus rest shoulders small businesses employees. yet several spreading events planes. I'm talking abt herd immunity crowd saying o_o bc  shit took toll mentally. Alone apartment, seeing nonstop rising numbers news, favorite restaurants around shuttering up, dead silence except sirens sometimes sound people crying thru windows. assholes want us dead badly? I‚Äôm El Paso go today get prescription. Everything looked normal. Lots shoppers traffic.. talk shut yet see it. mall busy. People inside whataburger eating masks. Walmart‚Äôs packed. People still going out. Sadly. Supreme Court upheld health laws like mandatory vaccines schools different? don‚Äôt want wear mask stay home get everything delivered like home school kids avoid vaccines.  Keyword ""primary"" measure. lock wear masks work. lock contact trace prevent spread, work. Lock downs can't primary preventative measure, sure shit help. thought right wing idealogues argued safety meant giving liberty... Oh, meant safety taking away liberty fetishize hoard guns time word ""flatten"" used article, title. author use words ""flat"" ""flatten"" article, people interviewed quoted using words. 

What people actually good news we‚Äôre seeing little bit decline,‚Äù Premier said. ‚ÄúBut make mistake it: **Please let guard down.‚Äù**

I hope people judging Ontario health care system based article's title. Cool man build beds? lose thumb holds pistol like that. People started wearing adult diapers avoid restroom planes now. ""We sure prevalent long term effects people carry REST LIVES, let's care that."" --you Duration symptoms another factor play here. work hospital access testing issue still would want wait actually test. False negatives likely test done early. think person replied making sex joke. least substance comparison ""but Trump said blabla /s"" see every thread nothing US. appreciate commenter putting time effort sharing point helped put things perspective. 

Though us fucked things, it‚Äôs interesting see others managing. Maybe no-lockdown approach isn‚Äôt working?
Maybe learn something save lives?

I‚Äôd like see less people dying virus. Agnostic

Theism believing god gods exist. Atheism specific belief god exists. Agnosticism state knowing either way. Apparently already seriously ill might unspecified issue.  Anyone know caused this? interesting Cause fully open far far long. also basically transit hub EU trucks go it. Easy spread diseases everyone passes you. drug boosts immune system. patients ventilators phase disease biggest problem overactive immune response. I'm sure even tried patients begin with.

It's much likely help early disease, active immune response issue. bulk trials drug looks far promising. Lockdowns need long enough hard enough ensure burnout cases near zero. US done that, choosing mediocre lockdowns long time vs intense ones. Wow! Thanks posting time took.
I get reading. Tegnell: ‚ÄúAll well! Herd immunity kicking day guys!‚Äù government can‚Äôt go grab quickly without infringing rights?

No. don‚Äôt bother unnecessary things. even full shutdown banning non essential businesses hope survive get hell insanity.

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly congregate settings overnight camps.

**What added report?**

During July 2‚ÄìAugust 11, 2020, COVID-19 outbreak overnight high-school retreat likely began single student received negative SARS-CoV-2 molecular test result &lt;1 week retreat led 116 (76%) diagnosed COVID-19 cases among attendees.

**What implications public health practice?**

A multicomponent COVID-19 mitigation plan including prearrival quarantine testing, cohorting, symptom monitoring, early identification isolation cases, mask use, enhanced hygiene disinfection practices critical reducing risk SARS-CoV-2 transmission congregate settings residential schools overnight camps. protect us Borg now? effectively locked since March. husband's boss dinosaur insists credit team runs can't work home. (They past have.) wear masks office, still thank likeliest route infection. know people get reinfected, herd immunity rate would take years without overwhelming hospital, long term complications thing, oh epidemiologist advocated herd immunity. sure, go get ""herd immunity"". Metric imperial? want hear coughs would pretty unpleasant laundry building, though. agree sooooo many sources comparison go wrong, least it‚Äôs something. 

To continue currency analogy: I, Swede, talk random Thai person, ask much litre milk costs Thailand, answer could 40 baht. tells nothing. get additional information equivalent 1.3 USD, understand put perspective. won‚Äôt perfect, gives idea. Give 4 day ban. entire week . I'll order food try relax Better use N95. easy avoid eating/drinking, lavatory access could inevitable. all, protecting also means protecting others around you. It‚Äôs honestly one nonsensical things I‚Äôve ever heard life. Don‚Äôt worry, week away Biden president. empathetically ask everyone wear mask. public, hearing endorsement sitting president, respond. Covid US couple weeks. Thanksgiving saved! don‚Äôt go infringe rights. Much better minimally invasive. 

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

Health care personnel (HCP) increased risk COVID-19 workplace exposures.

**What added report?**

Among 21,406 Minnesota SARS-CoV-2 HCP exposures, 5,374 (25%) higher-risk (within 6 feet, ‚â•15 minutes, aerosol-generating procedure); exposures involved patient care (66%) nonpatient contacts (34%). Compared HCP working acute care settings, working congregate living long-term care often worked symptomatic received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results.

**What implications public health practice?**

HCP recognize potential exposures unrelated patient care use prevention measures, including masks. HCP congregate living long-term care settings experience considerable risk pose transmission risk residents. Improved access personal protective equipment, flexible medical leave, testing needed. Oh they‚Äôre busy giving contractors $5,500 fines extension cords scratch them. couldn‚Äôt possibly take time set COVID guidelines guys standing ladders one handed. Think many guys working roof without hard hat. They‚Äôre simply busy. People throughout pandemic largely incapable figuring that:

Low cases could low testing

And cases seem low population said country low yep, bracing mentally. Could tomorrow, could April, could August 2027.
Side effects could harmless, side effects could make rich famous cure cancer tasting like good ora√∂ sex drinking Pina Coladas. Could... watch contagion 2 : Novel coronavirus take place USA based real story entertainment people understand done protect us all?

a) taking test think may infected. face? want COVID, too? 

 b) already COVID, person goes door door delivering tests symptomatic people think might step right face (without mask, course) might ensure now. think useful, don‚Äôt trust actual motive sentiment behind based observations countless comments i‚Äôve seen threads france, czechia, germany, etc. most, seems like tactless declaration ‚Äúhaha you‚Äôre worse us‚Äù.

Sure, could pay rent week two late, that‚Äôll come additional $75 late fee really can‚Äôt afford, we‚Äôll pay it. bills get paid later following weeks. Then, bam, rent due don‚Äôt usual amount set aside rent. (About 80% total) struggle again. feels like walls closing there‚Äôs nothing make situation better. I‚Äôm considered ‚Äúlucky‚Äù area, lot already completely screwed. explain think 38% are? walk out, fed America‚Äòs utter stupidity. side usa, person holding gun bible time mental hospital material office holder... helps put things perspective. Great info, thanks link paper. First Lilly, this. Trump told makes younger! Starting think way Europe much better Southern US summer due entirely weather, necessarily anything else. 

Now getting cold northern US Europe, people meeting gathering indoors instead outside, cases exploding northern US states (which quite well summer compared southern ones) Europe. better ""seasonal flu 2x easier catch covid.""

&amp;#x200B;

Could provide supporting evidence. quit, know wouldn‚Äôt hear end ‚Äúselfish‚Äù healthcare workers signed put lives line.

You sign without proper equipment though. would ludicrous send soldiers warzone without weapons. People call selfish, sure, cares uneducated assholes? give shit die COVID listen opinions you? need feel things supposed work one important parts healthcare system. hold cards. can't function without you. Guilting staying system built always comply without fight, kinda shit never change.

If completely dependant job financial security, that's different story course. Ah yes, amendment #87: masks. How? Ah, that's another good 2020 tag line.

It is. shit. one could seen coming. TBH literally the... Slowest people know say messes make. 

And reason make messes constantly 0 planning foresight. almost like people gained control society somehow driving cliff. 

We need less wishful thinking, planning action. Jesus dont get people get I‚Äôm deaf blind. would say majority infections people can't eat masks on. would respiratory. However, upper esophagus cells ACE2 receptors primary pathway virus cell. people telling contaminated food fine...they're dangerously hopeful. risk less, absolutely zero. Happy cake day! They're right. vaccine beginning rollout would mean it'll still actually get one yourself, unless healthcare worker. Higher rates vitamin deficiency would main reason affecting ethnic minorities more. something something inexpensive supplements. automobiles didn‚Äôt help horse buggy drivers. Societies place emphasis helping people transition newer jobs rather trying force old jobs don‚Äôt match current situation. right here.

The article rightly points 'enormous patchiness' spread.

Reminds r0 incorrect parameter keep eye on, assumes linear dispersion, SARS-CoV-2 definitely not, k parameter monitor. [Relevant Atlantic memory short - forget original justification March something like '15 days slow spread'. time bought vaccine therapeutic development, everyone worldwide undergoing pandemic fatigue.

Hopefully 1918 repeat time around, fatigue set second third waves devastating Fall Winter 1918. Interestingly [people US wearing masks well. Wasn‚Äôt pope seen without mask also? masks? point long time ago. weird line dying Covid dying Covid. know true data years. think fucked though simply say ""they pre-existing conditions would died anyway"" lot arguments see. people could years longer loved ones. Thanks helping understand part happening. 

I seeing believe personal risk statistically low, feel altering behavior unjustified based personal risk assessment. personal observation seem annoyed even discussing issue.

You used several denigrating phrases seen commonly used social media ""virtue signaling"" living basement describe people agree assessment. curious opinions shaped social media, news organizations, political affiliation, personal research.

The reason ask seen turns phrase used political arena disruptive behavior. seems used tool dismiss topics without real discussion turning personal attacks character individual, rather merits topic itself.

Thanks advance helping understand further. Last week total 9200 cases Mon-Sun. week already 9500 numbers Mon-Thu since publish today Friday. going higher :S lot suspect. 100k daily 3 million per month, nearly 10% population. could another 20% infected New Years, least 50% population infected Spring (March 20). infection rates even higher Thanksgiving, Christmas, Chanukah, non-Chinese New Year. 

Given amount time takes manufacturer vaccines, probable we'll get high enough infection find herd immunity works. I‚Äôm terrified three fold. increased probability people careful contracting (you avoid exposure long, statistically). chance reinfection. People dying didn‚Äôt die first time. 

Well total economic collapse don‚Äôt know hit virus hard heavy one fell swoop. yet USA get this. Well, needs cure you‚Äôre sick?

Lockdowns work. *How* think general public enforce mask mandate government action? understand government ""social cultural?"" think drinking driving laws came be? think government invented nowhere understand people wanted ""socially, culturally"" enforced making laws?

What devil's advocate, removed reality repartee cloth? need stay here, situation. Specifically, enforce mask wearing? it‚Äôs already ? Lol Keep mind one week ago changed policy people symptoms tested (unless go privates lab). Still huge number cases country like Belgium ironic thing ever September crowd absolute Muppets misinterpreted every direct released manufacturers universities question. Even one said 'we may see efficacy data end September', absolutely never promised broad rollout September even October 2020 all. hope normalised wearing mask public feel ill, like parts East Asia. We‚Äôve sit next someone sniffling coughing public transport, masks could help. general day day activities don‚Äôt expect mask wearing continue like has. Many types particle accelerators perfectly round they're something want Shut down. can't afford lose 80 year olds! don‚Äôt know bet TP companies don‚Äôt want stop thing hoard. Particle accelerators perfectly round they're something want things listed things redditors anyway. Hence they're pro-lockdown tell people ""suck up."" lives paused first place. mean live EP currently nothing said wrong. need stop pretending conservatives

 lets call are, Trump worshippers regressionists

 many trillions ""conservatives"" add debt stop letting call conservatives? 

  many executive orders Washington D.C. Republican President's sign stop letting pretend give shit State's Rights.

 many federal agents Trump send confiscate medical supplies states, tell can't pretend limited government.

 many times write giant bailout checks corporations stop letting claim ""free market"" 

 every Republican Congress gets free ""socialized"" medicine 

 Trump ran got experimental therapy ""harmless flu"" 

they conservatives, pretend give shit abortion trick Jesus people pretend give shit guns trick rednecks wannabe rednecks It‚Äôs businesses find clever ways fit essential categories. beginning shutdown California working large paint company wants cover earth blood employees. managed stay open essential saying hardware store. one ladder stock, zero hammers, zero nails, zero power tools, zero drywall, zero wood, etc. Oh, also sold tape. 

I quit August. company delusional tricked employees thinking they‚Äôre important. Countries spiking starting low point

There 20+ European countries cases per capita U.S. past week. U.S. it... quite literally was. figures r/neoliberal Belgium uniquely bad though, holy crap! wrong. coronavirus stay matter what. point lockdown caseload reduction outright prevention. honest matter time, overpopulation becoming big issue. Okay, serious, what's wrong Belgium? 

They crazy numbers first wave, even crazier now. Yup, citizens freely travel back forth, closed Mexicans though. hope government actually steps - otherwise gonna see LOT bodies..... explain this? you‚Äôre meaning community transmission, hasn‚Äôt week. Testing numbers high. current cases imported, meaning caught outside New Zealand picked day 3 12 testing managed isolation. guy also horribly mismanage pandemic basically corral infected healthy care homes like? NY single highest death rate US? 

I get Reddit seems love Cuomo. No, wasn't, high?

But again, making point. People reddit either way let way right Americans hilarious, seeing plurality Americans first place. Trump done pretty good job president though I‚Äôm jury duty right case going week. jurors wearing masks, almost none courtroom staff are. wear masks hanging one ear, others wearing face shields usually tilted like visors. seems incredibly disrespectful us required law sit room day. Outdated. Fauci/CDC/WHO said people need wear masks least months Yes. think people think ramifications emergency services healthcare providers. happens there's outbreak 911 call takers/dispatcher (who historically understaffed) suddenly enough personnel manage? happens doctors/nurses sick perform duties? 

But yes, please. Keep upset can't get tattoo right go library. Joe Rogan shambles Yeah least government competent, say us America. Probably major celebrations, protests, counter protests election well. travel gatherings Thanksgiving. Xmas. New Years. hard sum everybody opinions... I'd say better Italy. least people understand we're deep shit something done. like people angry done, order. I'm pissed useless restrictions like can't go hiking biking one kilometre away house. shop owners pissed they're closed. lot people understand we've let offices opened long, instead punishing useless office work, we've punished private life. Lol :p. Nah I'm amongst: get vaccine, distribute high-risk asap, see numbers allow us get closer normal  Election Day spreading events Thanksgiving, we‚Äôll somewhere 150,000 200,000 cases day third week December 2000 deaths day end year. madness. kind scary own

 next generation (or idiots like Rogan, new recruits) actually believe shit

 Trump said best himself,  ""if allow people vote mail, Republicans never win another election"" Yea thats explaination sure. point was, true infection numbers even remotely shown official case tally, numbers vastly different context.  I've frustrated city handling outbreak. like mayor denial bad conditions right now. needed shut weeks ago. 2020 campaign platform was... pretty standard Nordic countries idk. praising youth programs public transportation systems make anyone supporter soviet socialism, come dude. case deadlier strain deadly enough cause death strain past on. Covid spreads like wildfire wither way make impact occasion. Multiple strains spread better use justify closing polling stations. Thailand (which low numbers) mandates test fly, mandatory quarantine government government-approved facility, testing land, testing end quarantine. 


And yet....  Good know! confirm. SDV quarantiner here. Also arting knitting generally enjoying legal CBD combos. feel like America going look like early videos Wuhan soon. do, said september well. I'm skeptic anything. think cases really telling big picture would epic already defeated. Stop believing lying eyes!! üôÑ/s downvote fast enough.  Republicans lie steal Trump shown much lying stealing get away 

 Soon, many Democrats going learn ""holy shit, steal money call side communists, call fascists? cool"" 

 election important. Trump worst President history get re-elected 1000000 scandals endless stream lies ignorance, Democrats going start stealing too.  they?

 Republicans always evil, allowing Democrats barely better evil.  Trump taking evil new level America.  like word evil, substitute lack empathy instead

 top guy corrupt hell, everyone underneath going think ""why can't I""  part reason Soviet Union fell apart, everybody stole everything could ability steal directly related proximity ""dear leader""  pharma industry weak literally biggest pharmaceutical industry sector planet. country produces exports much drugs medicine viable vaccine candidates

Mate. 150 vaccines development right now, 8 developed Germany. 
BioNTech/Pfizer CureVac two promising canidates right now. Halloweeneen things rounding curve.....upwards!!! Poland‚Äôs latest daily update (Oct 29) whoever wondering:

- New cases: 20,156
- Positivity rate: 29.7% (-1.4)
- hospital: 14,631 (+700)
- ventilator: 1,203 (+53)
- New deaths: 301

Pretty worried them... largely avoided spring wave almost everywhere still susceptible  ICU, hospital Best luck, dude Yeah... We're real :) . ton jobs too. lot depends space. Gen Thompson awesome, terrible news. said wannabe. He's still left Nordic making point lmao Sounds like talking China, entire continent Asia.  understand deaths lag behind cases? Revisit comment month. Let guess - screeching rights? Yeah, thought Joe Rogan going fix everything??? condone that. Especially first stop voting Cornyn republican representatives out. I'm violence, something torches imply, I'm peaceful assembly. I'm sure socialized healthcare prevent Covid infections. Test, trace, isolate must ""socialized"" though (so pay test able quarantine infectious period kind socialized income job security time). Awesome!! People financially secure can't afford take seriously. data shows lockdowns successful? seem like slowed anything here. entirely true, incompetency made way worse (same goes European governments) current death toll caught rising case count. Peak reported deaths/day around 1500 summer wave max daily reported case count \~75,000. We're going see way time. Mmm begrudgingly agree he's social democrat, socialist. right reddit liking makes sense, Nordic Model rage site. balls guy! Respeckt Big surprise, knew winter gonna bad. 

I hope government pull it‚Äôs head it‚Äôs ass actually productive. Hobby Lobby suck? Haha ever thought becoming lawyer? racial stereotype..people countries culturally ""We"" focussed ""Me"" focussed. know folks Japan specifically wear masks sick prevent spread pathogens. cannot speak authority Korea believe case well. study quoted data suggest possibility decreasing population immunity increasing risk reinfection detectable antibodies decline population

Ok see, headline omits part goes ""suggests possibility"". Thank letting know!

I actually wondering whether amongst think herd immunity achieved next Wednesday, big hoax, whether meant something like :/ knew fever coming in, considered act terrorism? live Queensland, haven‚Äôt lockdown since April there‚Äôs need 0/cases day know going tear shirt dramatically, say ""give serum!"" partner lives El Paso, largely approaching perspective outsider (I live across US moment), voting deemed essential service judge? Obama Clinton really need them???? think unlikely hospitalized.

The worse day coming 3 days, sure. Propaganda works. No. war crime committed war. ""laws war"", part international law, apply war. there's war can't war crime.

Terrorism/act war suit better. r/JRE going lose collective shit I‚Äôm one read journal name ‚ÄúElsweyr‚Äù then, huh? Article author needs lay moon sugar. Ordering freezer trucks dead bodies. Bodies people. People families, loved. protect other. Texas are... El Paso specifically.

Lot's places including El Paso said thing are. hits...grows...gets control know it. dangerous specifically potential unchecked exponential growth. 

US whole essentially doubled weekly cases two weeks. 

If people actually shut took seriously (not acted like everyone else.... possibly them)...we situation. hard allow people in? country allowing Americans in. yeah, it‚Äôs really simple easy keep country, Americans can‚Äôt get Mexico Canada can‚Äôt even get planes countries...dumbass didn't. did, vanishing antibodies. Hot topic since week. Nothing new. headline still stupid regarding study. brain clicked lol'd Nah, he's sub mill wannabe socialist. yeah, course reddit loves him. democrats don't, though, say nothing anyone else. Hey one party us thinks almost there.  Russian troll factory trying undermine vaccine? schools closed, clases trough Zoom meetings client. Now, lockdown go shop (one human 15 square meters), face masks everywhere, exept somewhere alone, shops keep 2m distance people. full population testing weekend those, negative test, go everywhere think, still facemask on. Countries urban areas still less urbanized less part total population lives them. Sweden urbanized Germany - 88% vs 77% someone shared data threads. portion forests land nobody lives much larger ""half country"". perfect measure fighting Covid-19 mean implemented help all. get point. point first sentence. Anne Frank much worse. yet youngsters said 'suffer' apparently young, must able go out, party, drink, go frolicking day. young!

They can't locked down?!? god, might get bored!

What children WWII, could safely go outside play starving energy anyway.

Let's compare young people days still computers, phones webcams, talk, game even might see irl,*if gave fuck stuck rules.* people's lives.

**You gonna die stay inside First World Centrally Heated Clean Water Running, Picket Fenced Fucking Luxury House/Apartment?** ex live liege texted mother tested positive, people know covid, fine mother feeling weak asked stay home hospitals getting full Let lesson countries, can't outdo US.

Of course plenty European countries higher rates per capita. wait. look Europe's numbers US could get much, much worse still covid. :( actual mRNA sequence component may similar, understand it, main challenge developing technology delivery mechanism (lipid nanoparticles) ensures mRNA doesn‚Äôt break it‚Äôs way cells. two companies might taking different approaches here. Thats part Americans Europeans react differently shutdown orders. Europe us live countries safety nets plus extra covid aid helps softening blow. US, many people left stranded. honest, system Americans chosen, situation highlights obvious flaw it; anyone suddenly entire life turned upside due fault own. What‚Äôs wtf. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm happy about. sucks. I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs inevitable point. Sweden likely exceed hospital capacity 3-4 weeks. Sorry say hadn‚Äôt heard yet. That‚Äôs good news. Although, like said, still worrying many people infected increasing odds mutations...

Have idea spike protein that. saying covid history binding domain mutating quite slowly? something could change? Like idk, perhaps virus could mutate mutate multiple times there‚Äôs way allows domain mutation rate speed up? fixed? Like characteristic coronaviruses something? would laugh I've predicting shit ceiling merge long. Well solution would El Paso parts Mexico relies (and rely assume) part travel area, obviously political trust happen. Hospital staff?! I'll believe see it. ""who created health conditions cause pandemic""

Dunno, maybe [propping open BSL4 lab could cause pandemic.

Hiding details world citing national security also cause pandemic.

What cause pandemic testing, thing China anyone else. going cost ~50M‚Ç¨ two rounds nationwide tests. Slovak economy produces ~400M‚Ç¨ every working day. 

Even helps postponing lockdown single day, already paid itself. yeah, absolutely diseases controlled vaccines/therapeutics.

Get rest, bud. Holy shit. 100k thing sure. I'm guessing next week. COVID patient mortality rate 25.6% March, 


25% \*hospitalized\* patients died? That's terrifying. higher Covid ICU mortality many places. ""you going over"" ?? wtf? thing Singapore. 7 imported cases day, give take.

But guess enforcement could challenge countries/states number cases high. Ironically, human rights ""violations"" stopped 500 people dying everyday. Where's Joe Rogan moving then? Canada? ‚ÄúSpace. It‚Äôs around us.‚Äù much SF actually seen? Sounds like you‚Äôve downtown fisherman‚Äôs wharf. It‚Äôs different NYC, big cities Many lockdowns laughable - example France close everything schools country reason cases exploded schools. Children connect people even masks help would wear home protect kids. :/ suggest inhale CO¬≤. know studied. 

I tend side wearing end chance calculation. Wait healthcare doesn‚Äôt cover everything? 3rd world shit hole country live? Laughing European. Early voting numbers Texas particularly high. think indication high voter turn something different early voting system compared states? Thanks, no! busy save euro cents now, cost us billions later on. comment removed mentioned certain someone made political apparently. I'll copy paste without get discussion Covid regarding chances gets age, weight, whatever one epidemiologist, talking hat. 

I'm literally repeating best epidemiologists country say. hat national advice given top epidemiologists country yes, I'm talking point discussion friend *(anecdotal warning look numbers Covid easy catch. epidemiologist statistician? epidemiologist Statistician? Defiantly not. Whether interpretation reading correct not, know considering epidemiologist statistician. totally moot get discussions considering complexity issues hand, complex, everyone would epidemiologist Statisticians, cause would easy. 


You already said anecdotal okay. 

If want argue allowed opinion topic unless expert that's okay, I'm pointing asked expertise comment thought. far see, ask guy said ""WTF kids going spread shit"" epidemiologist. doubts get degree epidemiology argue folks CDC, me, report kids get covid transmit others. 

No one ever claimed couldn't. less likely transmit it, nearly always asymptomatic, thus play big role spread Covid-19. Based conclusion primary schools remain open, provide benefits (economically, mental health wise, educationally) risk. 

Epidemiologists say this, me. I'm repeating it. adding anything, making conclusions, saying others wrong. providing leading epidemiologists CDC best route follow President Trump band anti-maskers covid hoax followers, hard answer side CDC. get degree epidemiology, public health, sociology, answer question assurance talking evidence based science emotions. 

As should, follow CDC US, follow RIVM Netherlands. 

However, government favourite epidemiologists say something else, mean right. can't say someone else talking hat allowed talk expert, also say people agree with. 

Also, surely since beginning epidemic formed opinion? talked *someone* feel things go? Discussion feel lucky US President undermining national health departments trained pandemics. Worse everyone one Trumps supporters suddenly expert anything post ""opinion"" favorite social media platform. 

I lucky I'm US. already felt way pandemic though. allowed post opinion social media, like guy said ""WTF kids going spread shit"" did. Although mind then, still criticized another countries response based thought.

Either one allowed talked virus unless expert. everyone allowed so, matter agree them. important thing view developed based facts, science experts saying. 

Sadly experts say same. sad part is, elderly those, like myself, vulnerable would die off. take distance ego say that, cold may be, problem solves itself.

With people dying, best thing would workers died. economies collapsing type, well, heard say economy go 10% - wealthy - yet 10% enough collapse House Cards cause cascade failure around, need less workers.

The elderly would die work. demise useless. might well save lives. cold calculative way looking things.

But problem: want economic booms. Companies invest, jobs created. need workers, population must grow. bust surplus people, scramble new tech get people jobs. demographic issue: find equilibrium number people Earth cycles economy.

This Covid problem now: people exclaim 'oh god jobs, think economy let virus rave out!' 

They understand vulnerable modern world is. days behead someone France nation red alert. News spreads like wildfire.

All nations scramble measures throw billions sustaining jobs. opinion really. see it. bridge viral gap economy things standing still. Afterwards back business, hope.

But cold heart situation pretty basic. People die elderly contribute much hit. cut costs pension funds government allowances... whole world bubble jobs shit hits fan, clearly redundant. 

There virus? cannot fly. Airliners therefore fluff. thousands people work sector. fact work bubble nature respect makes ill. Portuguese characterize country: Portugal Eastern Europe's honorary member. anyone knowledge know India's numbers seemed plateau? also thought would've easily surpassed 100k daily cases month two ago. Pic plz Thats happens administration believe govt regulatory agencies useless cut down. Many top OSHA positions left unfilled filled temporary hires. OSHA lowest level inspections 50 years leading outbreaks meatpacking plants population \~11.5 million. Lots densely populated urban areas USA similar population density. 2000 sad deaths per day. That's prediction too. cold weather really accelerating this. Every country northern hemisphere experiencing insane growth cases. going get colder. schools? open? restrictions - distance, masks, etc? Hey. Everyone knows 99.96% chance surviving.. 

But that‚Äôs actually scary cause means .04% people die 100% time. There‚Äôs massive travel ban Europe countries sure you‚Äôre about. 6 hours now, hoping people get hospitalised covid receive big bills hopefully bankrupt them! 

But look upvotes - worth it.

Empathy USA, that? Introvert here. (To specific: among people, perceive extroverted social. even enjoy company, never seek myself, need significant alone time recharge interactions.) I'm married extrovert, three-year-old (soon four). 


We taking virus seriously. daughter cannot go preschool; decided he'd leave in-person job, I'd two jobs (from home) takes care everything else. suppose gets enough social interaction child handle decent conversation. I, hand, thought I'd lose mind March April everyone always home, talk LOT. said, need time recharge myself. optimal, go sleep 7 wake up, I'm 3 PM 8 PM, go home office start working. use time (3 7 myself). 


It's far ideal terms schedule, night owl, best plan could come get crucial alone-time two-bedroom condo.  Biden president shit still bad, put states like this: lockdown receive aid UBI, stay open receive nothing. Well done Fraud Fauci stating obvious now? elaborate? hyperbolical way ending statement. patients? occupancy normal ICU beds stays less percentage beds occupied covid patients skyrockets. magnificent forever. Therapeutics development addition vaccines. need time. I'm sure effective treatments us future too. Plus 000s vaccines pipeline 1st generation vaccines end road long long shot. S. Korea also problem.

 
S. K. never closed levels social distancing. Epidemiologists believe chances eradicating virus SK April July. whenever daily new cases became near zero, government decided lower social distancing level immediately, caused another outbreaks made epdemiologists despair.

But amplitude outbreaks around 400 cases, health authorities immediately raise social distancing level, conduct testing contact tracing madly, situation becomes stabilized...then government lowers again... ==;... 10-20 samples combined single test 

This sounds like math problem high-school contests. ""Rounded corner"" behind shed end it.. article discussing clearly says droplets nothing aerosols. 


""If viral inoculum matters determining severity SARS-CoV-2 infection, additional hypothesized reason wearing facial masks would reduce viral inoculum wearer exposed subsequent clinical impact disease. Since masks filter virus-containing droplets (with filtering capacity determined mask type),2 masking might reduce inoculum exposed person inhales. Live Uppsala.

Try come Scandinavia swung far way, comedians make sketches male job applicants told shot woman applied position. people please, please stop using Twitter links posts good articles? Perhaps importantly: stop upvoting vote real articles instead. 


The tweet literally says ""Reuters"" end. means bloody news article one respected outlets world offering information in-depth article. Yet someone chose post bloody ""BNO Newsroom"" tweet referencing article?? BNO Newsroom third rate newsfeed even post \*links\* articles referencing. absolutely must post tweet referencing article, least pick good one (one article link) 


It took ten seconds find link 


Seems small number users keep bloody useless. Ping broken economy kill people pandemic ever could. gives warm fuzzy feeling shut everything prevent COVID deaths, real lives real consequences actions. crowdfunding hospital bills? Surprised hasnt called Trudeau Lie-deau shit you? cops keep breaking parties. Try follow news. tests. Try read written, not.

We 19260 tests per million people. Somebody already told you. Drive voting.

Anyone waits long vote already risking missing chance. People get flu Election Day boat. People hospitalized. People babies. People need emergency surgery.

The message always be: vote early! teacher think mean Margo? said removed reality? honestly know enforce mask wearing. goes anything else. 

i used etiquette example, laws. can't get 100% compliance even law enforcement. next best thing seek compliance things like persuasion, unless feel people beyond that. 

The larger point trying get - worth understand side's point view. sides demonizing creating grand shit show. least, that's see, room discussion anywhere. 

... finally im looking issue outside looking in. Specifically pertains situation US. 2 cents really. That's Australia, kind of. initiated program called JobKeeper government gave employers money passed employees paycheque. meant business could still keep staff payroll locked down. 100% successful, however know employer would closed would lost job without it. Additionally expanded welfare help without job (although much think needed, something).

While Melbourne hit hard (relative rest Australia, relative America probably call rookie numbers) slowly creeping lockdown. QLD, community transmission month positives travelers tested positive already quarantine. None would possible without political pay people nothing. seen population density countries? major cities? Absolutely problem. selfish Americans. Voluntary =/= without consequences ""right"" politicians Sweden would considered communists America. others absolutely change tides. That's voting works. give - alone. RemindMe! 2 months today precious American lives, many even white. /s absolutely character Trump. mean ""on brand"". 

Don't forget ""Q"" would push things behind scenes day Macron really Italian Fascist, that's masks. 

It's really sick imagining mirror world's countries problems... would wait result Teachers walking form retiring early. I'm sorry, live America fucked. 
Your whole system far shit, keep out. 

Maybe try shoot it? Freedom that.    love idea positive negative freedom two rival, incompatible interpretations political ideal. take separation church state Poland Exactly! boss getting angrier quarantining employee. funny one brought political affiliation...really makes wonder(not really) Anything could say would seem trite. Please make sure take care loved ones best can. well. reminds gamestop...  Americans job inconsiderate others here. I‚Äôm LI though. Also every store signs saying mask entry. imagine it‚Äôs easier keep mask car get yelled step store. local grocery store even security guard entrance checks employees don‚Äôt to!  work engineers. lot smart engineering stuff really dumb stuff. part problem is, many think engineer makes smart stuff. 

It doesn‚Äôt. Engineering based science learned, science. Engineers aren‚Äôt scientists. 7 staff whistleblowers. Abuse power taking bribes. went public knows Bill Barr's justice department allegations. Texas officials actively working suppress going affect us  Whew, yeah sorry getting mad man, thought trying say said thought beliefs (which aren't) Everywhere Maryland wears masks we‚Äôre seeing uptick, came aggressive, point higher taxes didn‚Äôt save March it‚Äôs large enough minority wearing masks continuing cycle illness death.

Thats wrong. plenty countries lot less people wearing masks, still lot fewer cases, pr capita. Take Scandinavia example, few, almost none wearing masks here.

So say majority americans wearing masks, Norway less 5% wearing masks. Yet fewer cases pr capita. Shouldnt way around logic correct? dont Probably opened schools  people get vaccine, also won‚Äôt get symptoms therefore decreasing viral load. According scientists larger viral load, worse infection is. decrease viral load lessen deaths hospitalizations. Especially high risk people (older people healthcare workers) getting vaccine first.

When vaccine available, it‚Äôs people get vaccine. choose take it, know risk. People can‚Äôt keep sacrificing giving lives months end others aren‚Äôt trying help themselves.

I see people wearing mask get vaccinated get probable booster. Maybe couple weeks that. vaccine least month stage four peoples, likely sometime spring, that‚Äôs public health measures. dude u heard google? like damn okay long go back handshakes, people super fucking close checkout lines long wear masks still. People gross. Ah problem. Honestly surprised see it, although maybe shouldn‚Äôt be. Tennessee recently actually pretty surprised many people *were* wearing masks required. big caveat ‚Äúwhen required‚Äù...but saw handful people four full days didn‚Äôt wear mask enter shop. Even he's stable genius?  Canada 10,000 deaths 80% stemming retirement homes deaths early pandemic.  deaths, *so far*

We Halloween party work today, looked like fun. co worker spend last week positive family member. Tested negative Friday, HR cleared come work.
Came work Monday, supervisor sent home, tested positive Wednesday. 
*#winning* didnt say anything that. Thats prediction.. well barring vaccine maybe im wrong. vaccine thats would happen. way around it. didnt suggest ""strategy"" eventuality think General Strike state Texas.

You must Strike iron hot, General-ly speaking.

I probs got watch listed that. people dying evicted, get hungry. US already simmering powder keg.

Give front line workers immediate raise paid covid companies windfalls. Take aggressive action keep front line workers safe, like providing N95s. Finally, unlimited covid sick pay people quarantine. second finally, can't let people starve end streets.

And keep hospitals overwhelmed. Otherwise bunch pain. basically think needs happen covid gets worse, start heh.

And nothing happen. things get worse. Name one virus herd immunity worked without vaccine. right, everyone wears masks 

?? Thank you! 3 year old doesn‚Äôt mind it, either. people scumbags. selfish pieces shit. Right, understand now. thought saying socially distance vaccine comes about. 

The people talking trolls, sit every day spamming thing wind people up. That's probably going cousin. Sorry advance. need fancy custom scare people Halloween. need wear mask. paywall claim unproven. also completely contradictory tomy experience live inAL Republicans reactionaries, believe whatever suits time. Intentional part time legislature. pointless

People parts Texas come infect I'm sorry


no, really douchebag. I'm Albany area, really first wave, thing I've noticed objectors anymore. first couple months we'd see occasional person wearing one, wearing mask chin. counted grocery store one time April May think like 1 10 people mouth uncovered. went past weekend looked every single person mask mouth.

I think new normal, everyone realized hell lot easier wear mask left alone make statement idiot. since everyone wearing mask would really weird stop wearing one. Reddit wholesome sometimes. Keep are.

Correct. lumped non-mask-wearers based political affiliation. Man everybody knows somebody who's tested positive virus. kind wonder type thing even news anymore.

I've six family members test positive. big deal. LOL! Oh think wants us social distance get vaccine widespread. group referring sub wants act getting vaccine widespread going take 2021. 

Sorry coming harsh. Lol, fucking insane part Abbott literally sitting **6 billion dollars worth coronavirus aide.** still spent it. Chinese government reliably transparent. problem Western political science cannot explain reliably transparent, Western political science applies West. Stalker lmao delete covid comments people assholes like post regularly actually, covid went doctor concerns, reddit. know, crazy Personally I‚Äôve always liked approach.

Problem gets solved instantly 5 syllables. Magic.  know statistically it‚Äôs poor people color die don‚Äôt care. sure hell hope not, career ruiied this, maybe wiil wake people up. dont believe may based geographical location. Heaven forbid tell people learn new things. might melt fucking snowflake. Lol, ditched fox long ago. much yelling. Holy fuck. HHS refused spend basically money Congress allocated producing diagnostics. administration seriously trying get people infected.  try wait least 5 days exposure. Testing early may indeed give false negative don‚Äôt want spreading it. women aren‚Äôt acting like virus isn‚Äôt big deal appear tough, unlike many male leaders. Wth? Yeah mean they're nearing likely exponential growth there. point really option otherwise healthcare system collapse realize space force actually real thing already. Voting essential service continue. 

Will impact results? unclear.  curve, end russian aircraft carrier. Alright mate, let‚Äôs see... people still wearing masks, several states peaking cases, trend going since March... original comment educated guess. Yeah might‚Äôve used word ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù really won‚Äôt surprising gets 100k. Chill dude we‚Äôve rounded corner. Saddest winter lives think biggest difference duration. late March people willing stay home outpouring support healthcare workers. neighborhood many signs people‚Äôs windows thanking them, passing month signs came people began lose care virus let disrupt lives.

With disasters like hurricanes tornadoes news cycle moves within month, even though recovery process takes years. I‚Äôd imagine news cycle didn‚Äôt move people weren‚Äôt personally affected would anyway. Exactly. Ohio worse without expertise leadership. shame  Great. US leader also advocated masks, guess we're even-steven. UK challenge study literally said reviewable data July. going affect election? That‚Äôs everyone wears masks rate stayed low.

Ack, nightmare fodder. wanted open window onto disease, unexpected fall-out autumn second wave. Sweden high level immunity number cases probably quite low,‚Äù Mr Tegnell told Financial Times. ‚ÄúBut Finland low level immunity. Finland go complete lockdown again?‚Äù person giving ""right-wing"" media quotes relied on? think you‚Äôre almost right. main difference imho isn‚Äôt obvious enemy blame. Americans easily mobilized hatred patriotism (nationalism). Trump tried blame China abstract didn‚Äôt take. obvious difference it‚Äôs taking long everyone become numb numbers. parents say theyre ultra careful, wearing masks, avoiding social events... Well except (weekly) times theyre hanging friends without masks close together- theyre outside fine! times went eat, three vacations took lied homestate quarantine. Probably that's pretty disingenuous argument.

France also something close 200,000 fewer fatalities. 

The guy responding brand-new account that's done next nothing down-play covid. Uncle Sa(dda)m Hussein Oh, that's easy. Trump &amp; Co. wanted go back Gilded Age. know... Kids working factories, uncontrolled pollution's, families routinely wiped infectious disease. 

We're winning!!!!

(Sarcasm, must noted) Linking healthcare employment US dumb move. Or, likely, mass forgiveness plan/the government buy debt.  Maybe different definitions ""rare"" something. 

And give numbers double hospitalizations? know see tracked. 

Also, tell metric using? proven reinfections, seem like severity one infection linked. Moreoevr, people really bad thenfirst time may stronger longer-lasting immunity mild cases. Let clear: many successful vaccines created one 7 corona viruses. would zero. 

Not sure English first language..so maybe there's language barrier. Lockdowns October/November way less restrictive lockdowns March/April. wouldnt get hopes up, maybe it'll stabilize situation that's think going happen.  best friend spent 64 days ICU, 49 ventilator. also lost 80+ pounds developed stage 3 bed sores COVID. Wore wound vac 3.5 months suffers emotional distress every day. yes, get it. I‚Äôve seen virus day day, month month affect someone dear me.

With said, rest country New York City example combat virus. Texas months watch, prepare, battle virus best state could.

Your state chose that. state residents chose make prevention virus political statement. city chose mandate masks inside businesses end June. 

I live city people chose follow science back March/April. live city majority people wear mask, even take trash out. live city compassion others chose wear mask others aren‚Äôt affected. 

Talk shit New York City want, things different here. went worst it, every one chance situation.

So laughing? quite. I‚Äôm sorry loss. chuckling? bet. 

Be safe, El Paso &lt;3 People wearing masks - issue masks mitigate people still get COVID die. lot us. data looks bad, cook books. Woosh. 

Im'a take screenshot post that. people's fault, really.  know experts say wear mask distance... So... them. think much wishing people die unfortunate math thing:

\- Late August early October, average cases 41 43K. Deaths average 700 900.

If US starts reliably seeing case totals twice high, particularly unbelievable deaths would also become twice high. 

That's certainly what's happened Canada, went 6-8 deaths summer 18 35 deaths per day since cases doubled September. natural - unfortunate - line draw.

*A doctor arrested warning China coronavirus. died Li arrested authorities ""spreading rumours"", later died catching virus.*

Apparently US failed handle pandemic. want like WhiteHouse claim successfully protected people ended pandemic? matter landlord spends crucial period denying fire telling everyone carry nothing happening. company's employees goes under? far easier government offer low interest loan, allow company keep much work force possible, workers end street without HC, requiring unemployment payments unable find work extended period time labor market becomes saturated.

The big secret offer companies economic aid times downturn, ones survive cost efficient, cost efficient tend lowest headcount... jobs those, exactly? like overabundance open positions around country time... I‚Äôm trying imagine exact image she‚Äôs holding Quran (or even Torah). outcry keeping religion politics would deafening. previous administration's response H1N1 effective virus prevented causing pandemic. Meanwhile set incompetent idiots office killing 200,000 Americans. can't even protect White House expect protect average citizen? Nah, that‚Äôs true Trump. also deserve blame trying obfuscate downplay danger. Thank finally coming senses.

At least decency admit wrong, even rude answer questions took far long finally ashamed enough admit it.

It would second highest military death count second world war, 14 times amount deaths American civil war, short total WWI military deaths, deaths Holocaust, deaths Cambodian, Rwandan Armenian genocides combined. Asking person made statement opposed person explained statement would probably productive use time. USA! USA! USA! instance, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, initial death tolls less hundred. many excess deaths caused healthcare system getting wiped storm.

Right ... lets say hospital storm coming send doctors home keep safe.

Unfortunately, means bunch patients hospital die doctors home.

What responsible deaths? ""The Storm""? faith humanity retain. *are* people stupid there. It‚Äôs full crazy live land Bibles guns. Well, it‚Äôs European swallow...  think arguable rights attack, think become en vogue attack others. think people attacking religion quite popular, seems Christianity attacking gets far pass say attacking Judaism Islam. labeled anti-Semite Islamophobic, there's faux pas elsewhere. also quite popular work Second Amendment rights bear arms people promote slandered quite shamelessly. gives fuzzy feeling stomach see someone proudly espousing things defiant way. one goes masses, bit swagger, appeals me. say.

I expect someone raised understand try convince you, right bear arms absolute view. ""love guns killing"", see essential. take long view history allow recent history weighted heavily matters. Things change time sometimes swiftly. thankful forebearers leaving legacy potential protection wish leave posterity ability evils arise even contemplate, least equipped fighting chance. simply negotiable me. expect may make perfect sense you, thought would least convey it. want crazy roller-coaster please. comments pretty sad Refusal act causes increased death suffering, prolong pandemic. thing going away vaccine rolled out. really, things considered same. US biggest joke world right now,says one thing exact opposite.

You said welcome Uighur people HK people? I‚Äôm afraid government thinks otherwise. USA back top. confirm, see ya'll violently vocal anti-mask loonies third world cautious clearly murderous loonies, worse gets don‚Äôt tell us - it‚Äôs circle! election spike cases? Dude, bro. Also talking Macron French government, would accept kind source would support way. allegation Macron basically promised wouldn‚Äôt go back lockdown

How supported source said (from totally different person) won‚Äôt survive,..., absolute generalized lockdown

I hope see difference. France‚Äôs new government would seek preserve economy second wave coronavirus pandemic force bring back lockdown measures

How promise second lockdown? Multiple studies shown protests affect transmission rate. crazy lot us US well.

But people tie religious freedom desire guns. unfortunate. like read registration numbers gun far read bible. Yea hear ya. I‚Äôm liberal area without many anti-maskers think case it‚Äôs people comfortable complacent. responsible thing mayor situation do. Issue lockdown order anyway, enforce it. Force state administration take court, hopes lag removing mandates long enough save thousands lives, break exponential growth infections. thing happened DC close-in suburbs. Unfortunately, DC suburb numbers jumped week. 350 million people u.s. produce 20 million doses month, take 17 months produce enough u.s. that's U.S.

20 million big number good start, small compared need. actions take? capacity reduced? Mask requirements? Yep. really depends. rural Wisconsin last week everyone really good wearing mask went gas stations hotel staying in. course, I'm also sure bunch drinking bars without masks holding private gatherings one masks. Seems crazy us inside US too.

Meanwhile here's latest case/death charts Idaho, running 7-day averages, pandemic may currently 34.21 deaths per 100k population, ranking 36th US terms per capita  Well, promise make America great again. specify records going breaking. NYC truly believe we‚Äôre managing outdoor dining, Im less convinced indoors far haven‚Äôt seen sustained spike Rich? I‚Äôm landlady rent downstairs unit. universe rich.
I think people don‚Äôt understand things end saying stuff shows that. mean knew system bullshit. actually put test, failing entirely. knew would, moment anything real happened all. bad think way represent looking peaks misleading. 

New Jersey example looks clear *because* state overrun earlier pandemic. Infections rising currently levels last seen May. 

That's good looking initial spike six months ago watermark. know many people believe facts pandemic obviously wrong? examples I'm talking about:

* ""It's flu!""

* ""This end Easter! (Or Memorial Day, July 4th, Election Day, etc.)""

* ""The economy tanking lockdowns! lock down, economy would fine!""

* ""Herd immunity!""

* ""When vaccine arrives, *everything* go back normal! ditch masks, party like crazy...""

* ""No, *will* go back normal! silly doctors say we're never going back *crazy*!""

Anyway, reason nonsense accepted ""fact"" many people reinforcing worldviews telling exactly want hear. Plenty people would rather believe pleasant lie harsh truth. 1) plenty us little reason fear scourge

2) want lock big portion population away....I want able protect scourge rightly fear

3) food deliveries....health aid workers similarly quarantined...etc. Think creative! 

4) wear mask, social distance like champ, uncomfortable inside anywhere right now. everyone considerate me, we'd much better place. binary shit. make noise risk stratification, think I'm one idiots sold country red hat. 

5) shit. would see tried dereliction duty, stood wall, shot rags. studies run government learn. deaths also broken groups. reaction ""misguided"" might've prevented spread COVID? There's way know unless study quantify numbers. storm hits town there's widespread looting murder aftermath, would count deaths put ""restore order"" checklist things next storm. studies ""blame"" anyone. meant learning experiences. population density. We're transit country lot people crossing borders we've got Brussels, capital EU. want get infected drastic. would crying shame  close 700,000.

Yes. Yes could. protecting rights from? two things threat US right now, it‚Äôs freedom Christians right bear arms. certain candidate healthcare human right imagine 10% idiots wore masks too. That's reason they're attacking her... saying wore masks, even people don‚Äôt want to, would able solve pandemic federal government cannot provide relief state taxes

The state could stop collecting them. Infections follow rallies. scientifically proven. üëç lockdown. voice herd. prepared march Vote Prop 22 live California. previous criticism people cling guns bible. Seems pretty nose here. would probably crave extremely flavorful rich, salty, fatty foods hopes tasting something probably eat fast food. H1N1 less lethal typical flu season. scary made young people sick. welp good know Fuck live Idaho still trying figure nutjob got elected. opened later we're quite seeing number infections countries. again, 20,000 day enough, that's government's reported figures: random testing average person street suggests far infections daily basis.

There absolutely doubt mind end worse vast majority countries. reason weeks behind opening up, we're weeks behind infections, hospitalisations loss life.

'Pretty obvious really, believe amount people country see seriousness this. And, mean looking figures, front eyes, interested following developments closely; still see means next months. ever case catastrophic education failure country, it.

Edited add: I'm overly political, get put people school churn role system. 'Probably schooling Maths, English, Science bits pieces; final analysis find water fell boat. No, bullshitting here. bulk false negatives, happen significant rate, related specimen collection. So, even low levels prevalence, presence still much indicative infection opposed someone randomly Covid waft nose. I'd ask cite source prevalence viral fragments detected people never got infected, know cant. Probably scariest thing current pandemic, thing seems set apart previous pandemics, fact many experts professionals discouraging us returning normal.

I wonder similar things ever said previous pandemics. in, anyone 1918 Spanish Flu predict return normal, something like that. so, would probably give hope I'd need; made similar predictions and, come fruition, would believe current predictions will? mean, also triples number places get delivery, least area.

Look, point is, matter they're biggest workplace safety issue since organizations founded. look big picture. shut up, carry on, keep going patient rooms day day subpar PPE accessible would hurt bottom line. can't ask much. shh go suction airway guy COVID.

Fuck don‚Äôt see problem this. Oh got you. thought saying equivalent 90. I‚Äôm immune!! fought bigly won! Oh shit... really? herd immunity strategy along, like said?

My county chose different path. chose try halt spread virus even eliminate altogether, via use quarantines (AKA ""lockdowns"").

Thanks strategy results orders magnitude better. Sweden 12,288 cases per million population. New Zealand 390 cases per million population. course lead us 5 deaths per million population, Sweden 587.

Sweden's ""herd immunity strategy"" utter failure. think worse that. There's undercurrent is. in-laws Twin Falls. Covid, evidently good experience (surprised...), they're Halloween parties. we're guess. know feeling that, well one else sacrificing I, disconnect really understanding pandemic (yes, get twice, yes efforts helping, even feel like wear mask, distance, etc), overall lack empathy? get it. get wanting sacrifice, steps suck, kids school every day, mess, one likes it, cases low school district. regardless damn thing holding. Religion seeping back politics problem actually weapons Space decades definitely rods god. cost launch far outweighs benefits. Hospital staff?! Holy shit, feel you. literally appointment hospital morning.....They've got police officer stationed outside hovering around door, big sign lobby mask printed mask says 'THIS HARD."" Masks 100% required.

I can't believe hospital staff would that. guess kind thing women nurses refuse flu shot.... use mobile browsing reddit, limit 25 pages, found around 2/3rd page guess. So, 15-20th post.

This scary. ""An ounce prevention worth pound cure.""

This known proverbially centuries, least. Quite possibly. Another explanation police generally allocate enforcement activities laws generally supported. heard Ontario, Canada, early June police would enter park separate groups, monitor masks, enforce social distancing. weather got nice basically told go away, forced make even bigger deal assign fines, use handcuffs belligerent people, etc. starts regularly happening starts clogging legal system turning general public them. 

I could see unfortunate situation police chief realizes entire region interest obeying federal state mandate want tie resources dealing one single issue people told serve protect resent it.

Oscillating shutdown fully open recipe fail fronts. extremists fall right would agree imo. scary thing think about. schools open? Lol, got downvote asking question.

The Schools: Across Belgium, one-week half-term break starting November 2 extended three days (until November 11) help curb spread virus. Brussels, policies vary Flemish-speaking schools French-speaking schools, since education regulated communities.

Right fuck outta haha Probably guys doing. Eating staring phone bed one thing positive Covid, that's testing positive. even talking about, death rate disease healthy age 70 actually less flu. Even super spread event everyone US would maybe 3 million people die. Firstly wins comes January. That's alot time enough damage done. Secondly can't really lockdown entire country best recommend it. state governors go lockdown. Tbh think there's much Biden able PMC see superior caste. regrettable conclusion I've reached. They're brahmins blue collar workers untouchables. ""major air traffic routes"" shutdown back March. yes, Victoria needed four months hardcore lockdown get 0 cases, US whole would probably need several years. US one country? map maybe. USA shares lot similarity Belgium country basically divided appears major friction divide. Belgium divide mainly along language. sure USA political. say judge power? American law work way almost 550,000 day? wasnt long ago 400,000/day mark broken!

The acceleration number infections alarming.

* July 1 ________200,000 / day
* September 10__300,000 / day
* October 15 ____400,000 / day
* October 28 ____500,000 / day defend Conte crown heavy, really heavy situations like one Wowie. would make lot sense case. 

I‚Äôve seen lot studies give convincing arguments viruses bacteria responsible many later manifesting diseases/conditions. think even proved so. really hope far children infected know, covid doesn‚Äôt cause new disease pop years come. 

If happens, fact people claim threat children low seen- been- massively shortsighted. true lockdowns place December things really get control much larger scale

This *absolutely* necessary get spread down. However, already know odds happening.

Oh well, guess we're doomed. I'm already preparing second shutdown place live, caused idiots living around can't seem grasp basic concepts social distancing mask wearing. Surely that's essential right? 

Are mean mental effects people wanting go lockdown? Fuck forgot shit kinda scary seeing exponential growth thing. cases exploded point Thank showing USA consistently staying top except spikes happened Europe March-April October. least countries like Czech, France, Germany something right graphs shows us worked. think saying France Belgium said another lockdown going back lockdown week. feel like time won‚Äôt even get half assed shutdown got beginning loved visiting moneyed friends SF! it‚Äôs foggy city mean? first wave ain't even yet! Governor Abbott's going happy this, use brain properly. Yeah, agree. Although see widespread shutdowns pretty much everywhere across country like March, believe *national* lockdown coming, regardless election outcome, believe second lockdowns *will* necessary *some* states‚Äî*especially* ones really shut hard enough first time, like Florida Dakotas. Sus... saying city 0 cases, everyone follow mask rule lay-off everywhere even hospital hor patients. Situation likely HC workers fatigue resign. won‚Äôt lay saying patient demand...

Unless USA heartbreakingly possible alternative timeline. Good luck election next week! Kudos Canada. But, but, gonna pass April? vaccine gonna out, uhm uhm... hoax!? No? Oh crap might real maybe keep arguing right people die we'll able move catch civilized world. funny, Russia apparently working vaccine asshole sharing it. reality, share export it, probably stolen oxford vaccine, thoroughly tested.
Not saying Russia good guy here, funny.. It‚Äôs way far development failure, clearly works stay safe guys cars? wear one I'm alone, gave friend ride almost realized potentially hotboxing covid. Felt pretty stupid, showed easy fuck up. keep going like normal then? Dear Americans,
 please drone strike shit parliament ~ Sincerely, Brits already develop tail? /s Thank youre clarification. people know trying help slow infection, counter reactions lockdown protest, spitefull following recomendations ""corona parties far know. ones know doesnt follow recomendations misinformed downplaying risks. spite 

I think pandemic end fought collective fighting together. 

This message used extensively cold war aimed citizens, think relevant aswell.

""If Sweden attacked another country, never give up. information resistance end false."" assume BNO stands Bad News Only?  REDDIT??

Not no, hell no.

Lot people would something like purposely come COVID plague type person are. look much like exponential distribution 

If consider bars restaurants reopened may 18th constant drop cases least 8/10 weeks. 4x LESS cases 10 weeks bars restaurants opened.

The first sign significant increase obviously linked vacations. 7 day average increases 6x 4 weeks 200 1200.. end july end august.

Then following 4 weeks increase 7 day average less 1.5x. Approx 1600/1800. Hard define exponential increase.

But happened 7 day average starting 2 weeks schools reopened following 4 weeks increase? went 1800 21000. 12x increase.

No way blame bars restaurants. clearly one single factor responsible deaths see today: schools reopening. Supporting schools reopening asking deaths. since beginning said 2nd wave spannish flu worst deadly. people chose dismiss it. 
After 3rd wave, virus desappeared, that's us president refered ""the virus magicaly vanishes"" so, again, people chose dismiss it. consequences going gonna really awful. think super spreaders already got that's we're seeing explosive growth July. know 2 weeks. 10.000 euros small biz month Ex friend? Co workers flew back US India last week. tests real quarantine, took Uber airport showed work next day. Well I'm big fan universal health Care, United States already highest ICU capacity per capita world.

In words bloated health care system one perks generally medical infrastructure sitting around underutilized. 

However amazing amount underutilized infrastructure ICU per capita slightly better Germany pays like half much per capita health care.

A lot learning virus get people exactly resources better going good least time. 

The half keeping infection rates low enough hospital admissions overwhelm hospitals. 

Long story short nobody anywhere near hospital infrastructure need power covet thing. like mask problem, need masks much greater normal need pandemic almost country enough capacity produce enough masks. 

Infrastructure much extra capacity built starts become ridiculously unaffordable. US already inefficient bloated healthcare, attempting ramp emergencies happened every 100 years would extremely expensive already expensive health care system.

You look around world probably see healthcare systems performed similarly overwhelming force rate infection virus, competency medical industry country.

the competency government people ability prevent infections first place huge factor, difference best hospitals medium quality hospitals significant they're lot great treatments anyway.

In lot ways people getting particularly advanced healthcare well-established procedures drugs specifically virus means expensive healthcare systems world going see much benefit budget healthcare systems world.

Either way they're mercy government mindset people they're going take virus seriously follow mask mandates social distancing hand washing. amount hospital investments stockpiled PPE make many citizens following rules taking things seriously main factor infection rate virus. Belgium Macron ‚Äì trying tell me? Unless western NY, lot people wear mask, plenty wear incorrectly. business enforce people wear them, sometimes enter said building get in, remove it. Still tons people gatherings around wearing masks practicing social distance. course masks work. mean we‚Äôve covering mouths sneezed forever - magic? Southeast Asia relies heavily masks look numbers Japan, China, Australia, South Korea Taiwan.

We need new president push mask mandates dramatically increase testing. might need close gyms indoor bars 6 weeks. It‚Äôs simple maddening. problems getting license produce sell vaccine, matter agreeing price. 90k yesterday. indeed record daily. unfortunately 80k days ago. Every developed nation least one formula. evidence effectiveness yet. passed safety trials, nations decided go ahead vaccinate people without waiting evidence, worst case work. Haha. Glad bring smile. meant funny. really antisocial asshole. Poor extrovert husband miserable stuck home three months. office opened small group people he‚Äôs happy around folks me. Meanwhile I‚Äôm happy house/neighborhood walks dog. introverts dream. ok exponential growth, results 7 days ago artificially lower average... increase voter turnout?

People got nothing vote lol solution every problem non compliance enact law, lean towards dictatorship control. 

I think crux issue think easy solution problem people share point view. think easy simple solution mask issue without creating potentially problems. 

My position everyone wear masks voluntary. big idea. fucked. I'm expecting health care system collapse 10-15 days. mean millions people lazy paperwork open bank account. 

There excuses. Americans generous someone doesn‚Äôt understand process obtain new official ID documents, many organizations help fellow citizens provide transportation free. need simply need ASK help. identify part town spread others There‚Äôs also crowded urban environment Belgium. curious, population 36 million Thank you. think understand now....

From we‚Äôve seen, virus isn‚Äôt likely/expected mutate virulent strain. But, still possible mutation occur could perhaps, deadly? assume depends many people infected, since understand- way viruses mutate game chance? Sometimes mutation allow virus thrive longer (less virulent, deadly?), times not. would also require change receptor binding domain? Yea exactly it‚Äôs also country soooooo big. cases exploding New Mexico, someone Rhode Island that‚Äôs basically world away. peoples lives aren‚Äôt changing what‚Äôs happening literally thousands miles away. It‚Äôs easy become numb it‚Äôs impacting life forget vote Deaths higher ever been. time, say death rate gone down. two facts compared discredits conjecture... unfortunately. big city problem? instance change much, virus actively circulating everywhere territory. might right. Yet would dangerous send message now. 

For example: Spain ckear period downturn like 3-4 weeks ago. Message was: ""things getting better, far good shape, please remain cautious respect rulea""

Soon afterwards (2 weeks) ¬°BOOOM! 60% interweek increase cases stronget measures again. y'all hear tRump Jr still TV bright eyed &amp; hairy tongued; Claiming CoronaVirus numbers ""almost NOTHING!"" ü§£ US media involved clickbait wars public themselves. little interest quality journalism, scattered exceptions. many many many sources honestly saying vaccine timeline remains uncertain. don‚Äôt get clicks, shares ad revenue.

People want certainty simply exist. long public continues reward clickbait keep dominating conversation. 2019: Yes free society, asking? Also look, certain eastern regimes require people cover faces, bad.

2020: hereby sentenced punishment homejail, due process actually crime required. Also required cover face, good. also think there's CFR cliff hospitals overwhelmed. 

But time we've improved treatment, could both. sold millions units. lot contracts. important thing get catching title article, tweet whatever, accurate.  wouldn‚Äôt curfew personally. I‚Äôm favor strict lockdowns. Restaurants I‚Äôd heavily restrict bars would close. Also masks anyone indoors public space. think that‚Äôs totally doable. countries poorly many also leader telling everyone life great clearly not! Scientifically means everyday fewer cases previous day. means virus dying populace. nurse know also told doctors seen Covid toes pre corona know treat caught early. It‚Äôs one systems charms works doesn‚Äôt; you‚Äôre like, fuck Texas? Get shit together business people every year like real governments. Yeah lockdown population hospitals could get overwhelmed take patients countries. joke. mean get packed concert halls cinemas Care state city name? Pubs restaurants homes. Interesting.

I wonder weird schools UK apparently none speaks there. Teachers included. see graph judge.

I'm mathematician, looks like exponential distribution. seem grow slow boom, line dashes upward. grow linearly. like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. like 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 15. math thing.

Also, incubation period COVID-19 *5 6 days* average. might long 14 days, lockdowns last least two weeks order safe, mean always long. People might show symptoms even two days. no, seen increase one week schools opened, two weeks.

Another thing whenever positive case, test people live house. schools major source infections, lot children would test positive well. hard find official data infections, think scientists would notice safety speak about? 1 meter distance masks? 4 5 hours day room 20? that's safe everything safe.

You forget one thing. children. Men get killed COVID-19 women. elder get killed young. People blood type get killed people blood type 0. biology thing. risky man mildly risky child. virus campaining equality. meant vast majority infections happen?

A wild guess? places happened May schools account 3,8% new cases bars, restaurants, gyms, movie theaters, sports events combined generate 4.2% new cases vast majority infections happen? say home family members.

People get infected home, that's super-spreading event, unless also invite 50 people. many people single family? 3? 4? 5? Even schools accomodate 25-30 students per room. restaurant may hold hundred people, without masks. risk same. People seem forgetting black friday too. 

Stores near 3 black Friday events selling tickets. thousands going lot abouts Epi pens save lives food allergy reaction cost $500 obtain two shots one reaction.

Narcan, nasal spray stop illegal opioid drug overdoses, handed free without prescription government addicts anyone community wants hand case someone chooses get high overdose.

I cant afford epi pens cant risk eating cooking friends, family...anyone outside home.

Addicts meanwhile encouraged continue taking illegal drugs often overdose regularly free replacement narcan time....paid partly without consent. see people break quarantine, curfews whatever time it‚Äôs strict. see demonstrations protests. doubt compliance increase it‚Äôs enforced regulated. Sweden it‚Äôs somewhat easy follow population might unsettled upset. However, would open argument could middle ground here. Science, Nature Faux News.  makes think they're honest? Like human version ant poison bait box kitchen. mother fucker mayor republican, think republicans shutting cities?    we're animals North Eest.  even close.

The 10th amendment says:

The powers delegated United States Constitution, prohibited States, reserved States respectively, people.

So states choose pass law requiring masks without constitutional problems may get shot free, zero chance make vaccine available point. Scientists analyze thousands samples patients, check virus mutating. see mutations detect receptor binding domain. domain makes virus attach cells. Mutation rate pretty much fixed, expected change meaningful way. 

Most important thing keeping infection numbers low. Also important analyze samples patients continuously see vaccine evading mutants show up. sounds \*extremely\* low tbh. doctors use proper criteria putting someone ventilator (i.e. good chance walking away good chance surviving least 6-12 months) number higher. varies countries/cultures, US outlier belive. drive voting stations ballot drop off. voted early good social distancing. Gave everyone alcohol wipe wipe ID giving voting judge, finger cot cover finger voting, wiped machine voters, sanitizer door way out. Everyone masks, although notice door said masks ‚Äúsuggested‚Äù, required. Several Texas cities went soft lock downs basically never locked first place. hope works. I‚Äôd put strict recommendations guys. Time tight. Good luck Europe control it‚Äôs reserving like crazy there. Yeah leadership sucks need realize goes beyond politics human understanding. take years us fully grasp happened today. Nah, anti-maskers. Weird complaining forced wear shoes shirts stores. Well said infects Russia, infect Unfortunately won‚Äôt fix idiots willing comply. Plus days might get change back.as shortage. eating restaurants poor thing. never believe anything Russian Government says. healthcare experts agree?  partially.  healthcare experts say study correctly concludes infection risk lower plane places stores restaurants. study gave much credit air circulation system airplane cabins pushes air high-efficiency particulate air filters, known HEPA filters.  experts note test limited certain scenarios. study measure happens infected passenger turns head talk fellow traveler gets seat walk aisle use lavatory. mannequin stayed seat, facing forward, tests. pandemic, bars restaurant revealed opposite GP offices hospitals.  Except thing got start summer months... Unfortunately going anywhere seasonally overstep? wanting taxpayers future taxpayers die unable work preventable illness exactly sort thing government interested in. It‚Äôs weird right? live we‚Äôve told can‚Äôt go back normal lives find something drastically reduces fatalities hospital admissions. vaccinate risk population trick.
But late see articles popping say can‚Äôt go back normal virus virtually eradicated vaccine induced herd immunity tested positive What? mean ""The United States among lowest case fatality rates major country""

I really want see measure that. Maybe definition major countries countries largest economy world. ""The first human right right live, sacrificed economy.""

~ said none human rights lovers, finger-pointing democratic countries. Exactly say! Yes, somewhat correct. One reasons chimp adenovirus adenovirus-26 used people don‚Äôt antibodies antigens present. means vectors won‚Äôt neutralized infect cells start produce SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. far generating antibodies vectors, would less sure. vectored viruses defective sense can‚Äôt reproduce another vectored virus unless externally provided necessary protein. living host, generally wouldn‚Äôt able escape cell able present antigens antigen presenting cells immune system (note adenoviruses embed proteins cellular membrane like coronaviruses‚Äîthey protein shells (capsids) RNA nobs‚Äîso none original proteins get cell). That's nice. 1000 schools province Ontario cases. issue cases schools important keep schools open. Hence important close restaurants, pubs theaters b Cool quote, it‚Äôs applicable here. 

Telling wear mask spread plague isn‚Äôt tyranny all. Period. Folks, let‚Äôs lose perspective here. vast majority cases El Paso due influx infected people coming border.  cough symptom.

Everyone blames fault. Congrats El Paso. Vote blue lost freedom! mom works UMC. already working 14hr shifts says looks worse every day. Patient beds hallways, doctors able take breaks etc Anyone worried shutdowns US. large cities start shutting could lose job 2nd time. concerned going again.

Any reason I'm wrong worries that? see happened el paso.... actually right. shocked brother told it. Sf fast becoming dump  can't work home, job Damn hun really turning heat one. think so? Oh bad! Thank correcting me. went Costco hours shutdown announced. run Kirkland tp everyone pack Charmin Scott cart. go :( ‚ÄúOh fuck, 100k end next week.‚Äù

It‚Äôs thousand deaths day concerning. Glad better handling virus China. certainly are. husband El Paso supposed go visit month grandparent‚Äôs birthday. planned nearly year, Covid started, realized wouldn‚Äôt going that‚Äôs ok. However, many family members made trip and- get this- upset family didn‚Äôt go. Like, upset point aren‚Äôt talking us. Fun times. Right ICU COVID-19 10% spring peak curve, even doubling get capacity. Again, currently less 500 ICU beds, spring doubled almost 1200. lot buffer help health care continue operate. 

I one regions imposed stricter measures ordered work home next three weeks (or advice gets extended, probably will).. situation right one day per week work office, rest still home keep limit people offices reasonable level. mean successfully got twice reinfection super common thing so... Money, 90% time money. Belgian here, 715,000 new case per day US population. read it? That's first time heard this, source? Grocery store workers (and essential workers) already enormously underpaid. far know- aren‚Äôt getting hazard pay study clearly shows right to. 

What‚Äôs sad that, least area, see essential workers complaining people receiving unemployment checks larger monthly income- rather complaining/advocating better treatment, unionizing striking. can‚Äôt blame understand risk taking stand- cooperations responsible unethical treatment held responsible. know fair blame president entirely. Sure, trump definitely take it, bit end day many people successfully ignored thought best anyway. blame placed individual performing action. Well, hope Germany able help you, France saturated quickly... Makes complete sense, right? Sigh. Sure. 

My hometown unicorns flying cars money trees! 

I wont tell though! Except restaurants. one wears eating together outside. seem like reasonable thing do. really dont get it. want support local restaurant, get take away. really asking dine in. order affect Bliss well? separate entity case. Belgium limited contacts 1 personne outside home still cut it. expect today told cannot see anyone living outside household anymore. schools stay open obviously Mahh freedumb. would agree watch single Muslim murder American suddenly BOOM everyone care precious life again!

Maybe Americans guided hatred empathy... certainly pretend care whenever blame Muslims Liberals. It‚Äôs blood bath states moment. joke called solidarity iam proud able help european friends even means take additional risks. giving grief tweeting pic celebrating glass whiskey zero cases..calling tone deaf.  fact anyone fanboy political leader quite sad imo.

Because he's cult leader. saying there's chance? ""If two weeks, situation better control, able re-evaluate things hopefully open businesses""

 2 weeks? way. guess, make stupid decisions US, states get away it, due population density such. something stupid Belgium (like loosening restrictions infections rising) hell breaks loose. think idiocy everywhere tbh. work small shop. boss. became sick covid test yesterday. waiting results. 

I woke morning runny nose cough.  

I never wanted post nasal drip now. Even worse comparison, 90% cases returned travellers overseas go mandatory quarantine 2 weeks immediately upon arriving. They‚Äôre technically people ‚Äúgot covid‚Äù australia, got tested arrival. Seems like mnow herd immunity (although admittedly people claiming ""we reached it"" either). RESISTANCE spread, magic number turns virus off. least someone leadership position U.S. trying save lives, U.S. rapidly approaches 100,000 cases per day.

Good luck, good health wishes everyone. Tbf, Lockdown fatigue thing. lockdown now, blowing reserve people's patience. There's 0 chance lockdown end flu season. Broad restrictions + specific lockdown areas seem like smart long term plan. Every disease affects individuals differently. literally HIV it‚Äôs bad bought food poisoning back 2006. actually trying suggest *you* didn‚Äôt particularly bad bout Covid isn‚Äôt particularly bad? would fucking stupid. call New Commonwealth drop Europe bit, ragey brexit muppets favour *an good practice next pandemic. climate change could happen much sooner anticipated. Welcome humanity, others trying manipulate other's perception since homo sapiens. Brave? serious right now? Brave ICU tending people willing put situation. Build church heart instead stop hurting others. thing vaccine se need permanently protect us antibodies live Saint Paul, MN- see 50/50 wearing masks vs. wearing them. mandate place, isnt enforced. Hell, pulled week cop wasnt even wearing mask. Albuquerque pretty consistent masks. small town New Mexico much. known results imminent Ouch. That‚Äôs quite burn long-Covid/hypochondria sub. long time
 
we dont know long time, probably highly resistant several months, exposed half year showed immune response wanst enough, similar many ppl

new strains evolving encounter different one immune resopnse would weaker making infection likely especially important people risk groups. imho would good tactic send pack n95 every citizen 60yo. There's room New Mexico hospitals take flow now. We're like 80% ICU capacity already looking big jump come Halloween parties. I'm NJ too. become norm throw mask heading store dealing someone close. least Central Jersey. think things different South Jersey shore, unfortunate. answer obvious me. Putin wants destroy USA. I‚Äôm sure don‚Äôt hold folks financially liable harm they‚Äôre committing. want express liberties, also accountable risk, personal financial, incur. thats even true would over. would slow dramatically help problem. but, line coooks still going sweat food, people still touch masks faces etc. experts even pointing bc wear mask doesnt mean wont get it. thats completely false per experts would everyone wore masks. saw video thought ""what complete crazy"". Putting gun top bible, seems contradictory. Pro-life here's gun made kill ~~things~~ people. Nah I'm pretty sure one troll designed question democracy seems common theme thread lately. 

Apparently means people decedent need abolish democracy contain virus. 6 november hit 2000 ICU limit.

They soon starting new phase increase 3000 ICU.

Also private investor start local hospital kids. young kid lost battle cancer want parent loose kid.  think important factor corona timeframes. takes long kill, survive longer contagious. keeping people alive help keeping people contagious longer. 

However, milder case keeping people hospital beds might cause infections. optimal host probably someone persistent cough feel sick enough stay home go hospital. unfortunately, symptoms last longer, variation advantage too. upper part huge range completely absurd. think issue third party candidates allowed participate televised debates even acknowledged mainstream news outlets. Someday... least US, restaurants make far money drinks food. People take-away usually get drinks. Notice map opposite earlier year coastal states getting hammered. almost like virus logical predictable Americans. Fairly common Afghanistan Northern Pakistan. Except religious text different. Keep mind number specimens initial report week incomplete, increases fair amount next week little bit week that.

That said, even accounting this, worst case prevalence clearly 15-20% normal. Hopefully proportion stay similar ramp peak flu season.

Good thing covid hospitalizations ramping up. *Mitch grinned sardonically.* utter complete lack kind health building healing. done people outside system using resources, thinking, money, efforts exactly zero help medical community government. fact, get medical community get anything discouragement: ""that harm you"", ""that work"", ""you can't heal disease; progressive incurable"", etc. etc. etc. ya remembered 10th posted that. 10th amendment doesnt mean isnt something else constitution prohibits Applying South Dakota's case rate yesterday would give us 375,000 cases. get ready another country wide mandatory government enforced lockdown. See spring pastafarians fair, Biden Harris probably believe single-payer plan

There absolutely evidence this. Obama Administration made sure single payer even one can't support called socialists.

EVERY DEMOCRAT called socialist! can't base decisions that.  leaves.. [Mississippi one outlier Rt less-cool weather going them, probability Mississippi states bucking trend? mask mandate expired end September. 

Arguably cases never really went perhaps ""consistently high"" almost leads one question data accuracy/quality. said, could they're truly weeks behind rest curve. Mississippi pretty insular state (similar Maine actually). Yeah... Personally I'm putting candy outside, crossing fingers none crazy kids take candy. 

Thankfully there'll probably less kids general Halloween night, town discourages it. Still think people make choices based personal risk tolerances, though. I'm pretty sure parents approve outright banned trick-or-treating. Test would worthless day after, especially rapid test. 

You need wait 5 days get tested. Probably nonrapid test.

If home time, set quarantine zone house. Stay room, use window get outside maybe, mom leave food front door. wear masks indoors. adjust taken account. Analytics used baseball. throughout every corporation Center Disease Control would also neck deep it. 

They told us start disease would go away, are. People like using napkin math try prove wrong still might amusing though. going enforce mandate? FBI? Local law enforcement, enforcing federal mandates? Doubtful. Can‚Äôt charge person state court violating mandate. 

You tie COVID relief money. well deleted comment seems like agrees now. said risking catching virus 15 dollars makes it. seems clear plus deleted comment Ok. El Paso going people got laid off?

That's right. damn fucking thing. I'm getting fucking scared now. State shuts absolUTELY FUCKED Oof. Ya Sturgis I'd swing get carny food way out. Good luck you. this, February? brother lives Texas openly brags Mayor said ignore mandates, city enforce anything, go business. Risking lives health keep restaurants open. top that, excessive restaurant food part reason (of many, many reasons) society fat unhealthy. Then, even good times, restaurants lousy jobs due low wages benefits sick time (in US...I know it‚Äôs different elsewhere). mess we‚Äôve created ourselves. think pay? Something blood stone. cases: rate: 24% hospital: 16,994 ICU: 1,746 deaths: 199 Calling idiot insulting idiots. whining Reddit Santa Clara County here. can't enter buildings without mask.

How know Trump influenced press release trying get headline election? ‚ÄúFEMA camps‚Äù? I‚Äôve told meth smoking fruitcakes many times shiny part aluminum hats goes outside.

Ah okay answer looking Thanks production electronics halted Covid, GameStop end becoming essential. worked first lockdown sold inventory headsets, hdmi cables even high end gaming Keyboards mice.

Spoiler: don‚Äôt black friends. Lol act causes _increased death_

Short term. evens eventually. thing could make photo American fat guy yelling something clue about, Eagle. honestly mess coke anymore either. smoke hell bud though.  obviously subjective, that's range I've typically seen based various sources I've read. Here's one reporting estimate lower end scale. say ""more half restaurants business today won‚Äôt survive crisis"", link story NY Times.

And ""more half"" includes restaurants/bars including chains. we're talking privately owned mom/pop places (like good places city), that's see 70-80%. US third world country wearing gucci belt. answer FHM (and numerous authorities provided answers too) inquiry initiated government change temporary law (that limits gatherings) done conditions, etc. lower efficacy drug would people infected, would end trials quicker. waiting probably means effective vaccine. event all. 3. people died suffering lifetime disabilities caught covid get first point, hard get unbiased news basically end going CNN equivalent FOXNEWS equivalent usually truth somewhere middle. also adjust pop density. NYC &amp; NJ epicenters one point. entire world classify covid deaths someone dying covid someone dying strictly covid? fact right good.

Whether infectiousness IFR Corona worse flu significantly.

Just substitute COVID name ‚Äúparticularly dangerous strain flu‚Äù plug numbers see... Possibly 500k+ deaths USA alone get year this... would justify masks social distancing measures regardless call disease getting point many dying.

What really interested seeing IFR people get vaccinated still get Corona, possibly 20 50% vaccinated.

Once see numbers, we‚Äôll real roadmap imo.

If get thing 100k Americans die, think we‚Äôll within society‚Äôs risk tolerance. actually thought point order takeout, dine in. Cool, we‚Äôre going work reaction time. Delivered video holding gun bible. done purpose calculated attract voter base still believe covid hoax Abstract:

Vote mail.  I'm concerned profits trump vaccine's safety. Pharmaceutical companies *repeatedly* shown profits number one priority. What? would matter? different voting system, voting third party helps vote person like most. Sauce. Facemasks suck. hate wearing mine. throw trash soon possible. I'm worried too, small ray hope is. far, generally case overwhelmed hospitals one thing pretty much always forced various areas action. 

Leaders across country (and indeed across world) stupidly dithered around virus spreads unchecked noses, silly self-destructive sad. even stubborn, hard-headed areas deepest denial situation, taken action hospitals hit capacity, actions bring outbreak control. end awful period two three weeks hospitals slammed, things become workable again. 

That still sucks obviously, we've yet see example US area hit hospital capacity simply continued bury head sand take coronavirus action. saw sequence events take place El Paso, culminating shutdown week. Looks like Farcry 5 villain Somebody notify soldiers drafted died war inalienable rights. 

Thousands slaughtered drafted going war fucking tit babies can't wear mask Costco. 

Fuck people. Wow, group unhinged loonies. Weird. ISIS held guns whatever text deem sacred, idiots like woman lose minds. Americans same, idiots think cool. Diseases don‚Äôt pay attention state lines vary broad concept interstate commerce invoked require masks. She‚Äôs never read Bible life haha. That‚Äôs probably first time ever held one lol. love uneducated carb fed single passport holder lectures communism.  Holding bible, gun riding truck Murican flag. that's missing brother-husband Whatever happened ‚Äúthou shalt kill‚Äù? Theres even iota evidence widespread long term symptoms. Even 2-3% pushing it. Bring numbers find n=7 studies peer review singular case studies.  flat wrong. use averages 2015-2019 get weekly trends, modify expected percentage increase get expected deaths 2020, compare actual deaths that. idea got misinformation, need stop spreading it. 

In fact, one primary findings relative increase excess deaths highest younger age groups. ""dying age"" argument makes little sense context. comes ‚Äúthey calling flu covid crowd.‚Äù

Guys, test now, state desire ramp cases, scares consumers. really missing one major tenets Christianity, helping others. Eye needle that. What‚Äôs wrong people? don‚Äôt understand.  doubt standard door door trick treating would worse school day, include kind downtown trick treating local businesses, big halloween parties, etc would probably bigger driver cases classroom. article assert should. simply reporting excess deaths saying experts trying tease details see full impact pandemic population terms mortality. Surely covid deaths missed. Fine. deaths possibly would happened pandemic.

As case things natural disasters direct indirect casualties. Sometimes line clear, sometimes gets fuzzy. flood, someone drowns flood waters would direct casualty. Someone else might need unrelated lifesaving treatment unrelated flood, cannot get treatment flood made impossible get hospital. still casualty flood and, depending looked at, counted I‚Äôm thankful grateful known since January finally getting attention.

Folks, everything lie Gov keep economy markets going... addition fueling massive profits insiders. Covid extremely profitable big $$ coming winter real wave hits.

You reckon NZ hiding truth too? don‚Äôt know enough viral loads know answer this. chance one shedding lot virus could make person severe case. think discussion black white.

Many people India starting say democracy deathbed India. imagine could saying thing come 2030 US turn around. article saying vaccine prevent infection progressing disease, way flu vaccines work. get sick flu don‚Äôt end hospital. 
As opposed way sterilising immunity measles vaccine stops even getting infected. Even still buy locals, thats point. point government telling allowed buy. Prohibited items included board games too. everyone stuck home (especially kids need blow energy don‚Äôt understand pandemic), don‚Äôt think board game could save lot heartache even suicides? reason, don‚Äôt think fear overblown all. Maybe disagree. Idk think people realize large Texas unless they've there.

It's ridiculous. One day woke Texas, drove nearly 800 miles, stopped night, still Texas. Thats gotta typo. 10pm 5am. see 6 months No, government say mask stay home lockdown vast majority people would actually comply lead success controlling pandemic within borders. people economic interest lifting restrictions press that, would naive think happening side Probably 40-70% samples genetically sequenced within whatever timeframe decided on. (So pretty close counting active cases would get you.) ...and places uptick, local restrictions increased USA again. Shutting whole country places coming stupid. downvoting reality alter reality

If reality seem change every five minutes I'd agree you.

So *not* allowed go back 'normal' vaccine arrives, vaccine even stop disease? Yes, know. That‚Äôs used term ‚Äúthird surge‚Äù third wave thanks clarification ICU capacity 100% Yup, 2-3 different know happening behind scene stories. said lot staff sick, kept hush hush.

We really idea widespread first surge was. still first wave. uhh, yeah, can't get now. late. nobody letting us in.  O.k. 2020 United States, people want empower police hassle people masks. could go wrong? Fever sore throat pretty non-specific. Could covid, could also strep (particularly there's cough kind white coating tonsils). Worth seeing doctor--they might test rapid strep comes back positive treat right away. *Over*compensating. already mass testing last weekend regions corona cases.

Businesses partly open, causing widespread unemployment, many schools remain closed, personal lives greatly curtailed ‚Äî yet spread novel coronavirus accelerating rather receding. Sunday, seven-day average daily infections United States 69,000, highest figure yet.

Nobody wants return full-scale open-ended shutdowns early days pandemic. yet muddling forward working. compromise, European leaders embraced idea ‚Äú[circuit ‚Äî fairly intense closures lasting limited time ‚Äî would interrupt viral spread bring case counts without long-lasting social economic pain extended lockdowns. Britain‚Äôs Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer, [called circuit-breaker two three weeks, example, prevent ‚Äúsleepwalk ‚Ä¶ bleak winter.‚Äù Circuit breakers one-off interventions [regular (say, three-week ‚Äúreset‚Äù every two months).

The case circuit breakers rests part failures current approach. [Phased aim allow much activity possible, consistent keeping cases controlled levels social distancing, masking restrictions. number disadvantages practice. First, hard maintain extended periods compliance fatigue sets in, standards relax ‚Äî cases tick up. Furthermore, disparities infection rates, within states, make sacrifice inefficient. Many towns subpopulations already sacrificed enough eliminate internal spread, constant threat outside reinfection prevents relaxing enjoying triumph.

The underlying idea circuit breaker approach makes intuitive sense: cutting oxygen fire reduce embers, instance, restoring airflow intermittently doesn‚Äôt produce large flames. add steady continuous oxygen supply, even low level, blaze quickly rages control.

One study making use epidemiological models ‚Äî yet, peer-reviewed ‚Äî two-week circuit breaker would halve number deaths United Kingdom end year. [our preliminary [research society wants allow certain amount social economic activity, within select windows, followed short-term shutdowns, lead fewer cases allowing amount activity occur across unbroken stretches time.

Using mathematical techniques, work explored questions like one: Suppose town wishes allow 1,000 small risky activities like haircuts, ballgames, academic classes small social gatherings course month. better put activities one half month space evenly? mathematical answer concentrated sacrifice, followed period relative openness, beats sacrifice spread consistently time. size impact depends many factors, typical analysis finds 10 20 percent activity might possible (for amount disease spread) activity concentrated.

Of course, activities shifted time, necessary events like urgent medical procedures would continue circuit-breaker shutdown. Additionally, month activity compressed two weeks, businesses may extend opening hours maintain appropriate physical distancing keeping customer demand. Avoiding crowding paramount. even account issues, benefits intermittence remain.

There points consider designing effective circuit breaker. raging outbreak one subpopulation (college students, instance, migrant workers) prevent whole community stamping disease. Public health officials therefore devote extra resources ‚Äî testing, tracing information campaigns ‚Äî infected populations. may necessary prolong circuit breaker (perhaps three weeks instead two) [hot among highly infected groups.

According [mathematical one least efficient ways fight disease reduce activity solely among subpopulations already low prevalence. circuit-breaker policy exempts many people highest risk (such service workers whose jobs put close contact others) could inadvertently end exactly that.

Last spring, [nearly workers defined essential; exemptions made shutdowns somewhat palatable reduced impact. circuit breakers short, require fewer exemptions. time around, many factories retail establishments close, making time opening extra hours subsequent weeks. hand, businesses essentially eliminated transmission risk (through [contactless supply [personal protective [other might continue. general, open periods following shutdown would resemble current rules, masks sensible caution combine relative social freedom.

If successful, circuit breaker could reduce infections levels give United States second chance implement effective testing tracing regimen. Public private entities across country testing far higher levels earlier pandemic, can‚Äôt keep rising cases; circuit breaker would allow reset. true tracing, range mild interventions (phone calls high-risk contacts) robust approaches (detective work possible sources, rapid testing subsidized quarantines). robust responses effective, feasible case numbers already low ‚Äî situation circuit breaker might bring about.

Critics rightly point even limited-duration shutdowns difficult individuals businesses: New federal subsidies, stalled Congress, would therefore essential.

It would wonderful giving public activities unnecessary ‚Äî masks, contact tracing common-sense distancing enough. they‚Äôre not. Curtailing social business activity still essential: point make sacrifices efficient possible. amount sacrifice required keep disease control greatly reduced *coordinated* *concentrated*. current approach ‚Äî uneven, indefinite sacrifice wanes time ‚Äî clearly working. neighboring Mexican state chihuahua red alert crazy covid spike. largest city, ciudad Juarez right next el paso.

However normally burying 25 people week went unclaimed family afford private burial. peak deaths number went 25 day. know common rare is, confirmed case, infection sequenced strain multiple times, people done. think new cases number get much higher 90,000-100,000 day peak. Testing capacity there. El Paso makes think friend mine - Lou Romano still sportscaster there? heart issues past. would agree probably situations people think behave like that. But, think nothing thinking fallacious. think thinking many situations masks would still make significant difference, even people aren‚Äôt distancing well. 

Grocery stores instance. It‚Äôs unlikely would spend enough time close shoppers could contract covid wearing mask (and too.) logic would apply places frequented mass numbers people daily basis- like Retail stores certain workplaces. 

I agree that, ideally, all. it‚Äôs realistic expect people behave way unfortunately. lots factors going people‚Äôs adversity social distance. Like pandemic fatigue people‚Äôs prioritization socializing. case- masks certainly better nothing. wish different- think large percentage population would simply choose social distance *or* wear mask- given opportunity. also think, people chosen disregard social distancing far likely slack disregard advised measures- masks included. 

I understand aren‚Äôt advocating masks, don‚Äôt think acknowledging factors contributing lack social distancing. know masks remarkably efficient worn everyone- even people outdoors. would wager far outweighs people choose disregard distancing. country holds record? one reason go restaurant.

If 90,000 people mostly couple places, hospitals would overwhelmed care would suffer, leading deaths. nice analogy default countries. chose countries compare with.      
      
I'm comparing US actual developed countries top GDP world, islands thousands people small country high density population couple million. think comparing US France, Germany, UK, Italy, Japan cherrypicking Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, Chile?     

I showed India example picking countries low population US compare with. See happened compare smaller populated country (USA) compare India.      

The case per million statistics useful I'm gonna start comparing country like US island 77,000 people. Andorra performed 144k tests meaning that's almost twice per person. think US tested every single people? That's compare big population country minuscule population one even account per million stats. 14 days, take 14 days spread community, add 14 days spread in-home (and idiots), math, cry going Belgium?! want fatigue syndrome rest life? type cannot work even office job?

That 0.1% Black Americans died disease also [debate kind optimism bad. Got source? dick want read. Senate hasnt budged months isnt even open almost another two weeks. Financially maybe get assistance survive things get bad, I'm tired want stay working likely vastly undercounting reinfections. 

To confirm reinfection, strain needs sequenced shown two different strains (to prove remnants first infection).

-According GISAID, virus samples 167 thousand COVID-19 infections sequenced far (out 40 million confirmed infections perfectly distributed 167 thousand infections two per person, would mean 83.5 thousand people sequenced twice.

Of course, that's case. people infection sequenced once, never got sick again, instance. far, far fewer 83k people sequenced twice. Likely few.

-Then, top that, reinfections strain officially count reinfections, since can't proven reinfection rather reemergence original reinfections, strain results thrown out.

-Further, people most-likely get reinfection would ones originally got infected early (because time passed). less likely get tested first place early months (which problem data infections, specific reinfections.)

And then, finally, there's evidence people's immunity wears quickly infection less severe. would cause undercount reinfections people would likely get reinfected would ALSO people lesast likely get sort test due asymptomatic mild symptoms.

So yes, likely that, reasons, massive undercount reinfections. Heck, amount people sequenced twice probably thousand, factors.  Viruses care promises? Since when? Schools start closing longer periods first. could see many schools going virtual Thanksgiving winter break. No.. really going be. love boss said doctor friend works hospital, said close wings hospital. Stay safe there! None ever shown news. People single damn idea looks like ground, enormous problem. 1,000 people died US yesterday, still jerks downplaying it. O2 sensor doesn‚Äôt tell whole story here. may getting enough oxygen, definitely harder breathe mask. wear mask 100% time I‚Äôm required wore one mandate. I‚Äôm good shape climb mountains fun I‚Äôm used thinner air. However, breathing mask difficult me. Whenever I‚Äôm giving lecture often stop catch breath. Moving equipment around even worse. get studies show experience difficulty Rip john malkovich. Yea sister talks sit patients scared alone tell it‚Äôs okay ‚Äúgo Heaven‚Äù calls it. that, patient wants die, sometimes staff won‚Äôt stop tying keep alive, talks convince hospital staff allows patients die they‚Äôre ready. don‚Äôt think color job, she‚Äôs finds really fulfilling people huge moment lives. Right, point things worse then, we've probably either reached exceeded spring. feeling we're making arguments we're agreement. Actually, area hit hard early. greatly impacted curve stress hospitals systems. 

I understand seemingly unimportant area dealing high rates, us whose next door neighbors infected early March, lockdown made absolute sense. Guilty charged Agreed January, question year? put money 2023 nasty thing mutates deadly symptoms like TOF. Oh didn‚Äôt realize pandemic final death counts in. Bro, sub thinks it‚Äôs plague, u gonna get downvoted hell lol small American town currently dying every day. national display grief see.

Perhaps people realized understand 3,000,000 people die America year, they're able put 200,000 deaths predominantly old sick people context without crumbling tears? 

Just spitballing, though. people hoard tp??? something need. multiple options get ass clean. Even Kentucky remember back March April streets little traffic every shopping center basically empty, except Target grocery stores. making things head support narrative decided correct one solely invested it.

Miiight want get checked out. compared eastern nations. asked expect people serve obey... Ah, matter. mom says need shut since finished wine. evidence everything control.*

There's evidence control, mean. burden proof work like wrote assert, without offering proof, teapot, small seen telescopes, orbits Sun somewhere space Earth Mars, could expect anyone believe solely assertion could proven wrong.* Maybe man stop lying us told wife's name guy contact two days prior. asked work said call want know more. know shitty.

I guess I'm wondering health dept ask contacts five days out. got tested Friday went back previous Monday. saw Friday previous. France Germany back ~~lockdowns~~ reducing number people gather together, even November...

You're optimistic.

Edit: per u/GS_Hyperios knows whatsup  Better kill poors non-aryans bend whims coastal liberals - Abbot Normalizing makes big difference.

Leftism hope. 100k day November 4th calculations. Abbott issue another ""riddle"" Paxton sue anyone trying anything themselves.

Finally. really annoying time allergies, isn‚Äôt it?! Sure, didn‚Äôt mean seem dismissive concerns. It‚Äôs they‚Äôre aware risk patients pose employees, mouth stuff flying faces day. they‚Äôre taking double precautions, ends win-win us patients. Imagine ninth grader 'superspreader' KNOWING 116 got infected you......dang lol. (not fault technically, he's kid, &amp; test negative &amp; obviously incorrect, blame counselors making masks mandatory encouraging social distancing) Apparently covid also kills brain cells. I‚Äôm glad able stay safe :) Hopefully god awful haircut time grow he‚Äôs quarantine Sorry lot people sheep follow order blindly. happy people charge like making decisions based lives others checkbooks. 30k deaths agree good'ol Texan freedom? 

/s Lol can't wait til Austin shuts cries it. Protesting least think people need ready actual unrest. That's kind point, mention progressiveness headline instead making gender? understand feeling.

Back May, get MRI super paranoid caught then, luckily got tested (twice) fine every experience doctor's office ever since felt safe... big deal all. They're already send overflow patients cities, unlike cities US, El Paso *really* far away another major city. One friends family member sent Lubbock. Lubbock pretty small city 350 miles away medical field hub. people definitely taking virus serious either. tiny towns West Texas southern New Mexico even hospital virtually none capability resources run covid unit. Uh, Europe lot better far fewer deaths per capita. According quick back envelope mental math, that's equivalent approximately 700,000 US cases. People trick treat pandemic? Idiots thought maybe image moving bodies refrigerated trucks issue. I‚Äôve never marked anything NSFW before. 

I‚Äôm surprised would miss joke.

I unmarked it. That‚Äôs one sixty Americans. Exactly. walked office jail cell yet beyond me. imagine corruption organization, must insane. Philly. seen total 2 people without mask store since April

Can criticize them? assume ""we"" mean Americans? No, cannot. plan retain semblance intellectual credibility. South Korea one death today 114 new cases. Anecdotally, friend South Korea throughout whole thing. kept safe made feel like family. feels lucky there. NJ too. People great w masks. getting continuously informed officials. times earning ire great pumpkin. Abbott trying kill us succeeding. get speak anyone yourself. ""no one wants to"" know that's true.  Spanish Flu count? sole reason I've seen articles suggest herd immunity played big factor

Edit: Seems herd immunity Spanish Flu heavily debated mutations. Might research later. People started wearing became contentious. Cuomo came hard masks, early on. focus masks way saying""I respect you"". Businesses comply get fined. couple weeks back Idaho work, good luck telling state wear masks. people would follow guidelines, wear mask should, keep distancing reason shut down. problem don‚Äôt. Tampa never restrictions whatsoever. one care. Hope still get fajita kits think public would willing cooperate key points (like airports) forced cough.

Or even home voluntarily phone app. pain, seconds. Instant results.

Perhaps read comment hopefully miracle comprehension allow craft something sounds less like disorganized thought pattern. 
 
But yes, you‚Äôre correct- analogy fallacious. 
Not reason listed. also you‚Äôve completely ignored precautions take- legally meant take- safety others yourself. put place finally- you‚Äôve actually proven validity argument sarcastically quoting sarcastic remark.

You‚Äôre right- negligible amount homicidal people kill car intentional covid infection. Nobody would dispute that. whole lot willfully ignorant, unintelligent, oblivious, rash people *do* go spread covid *do* go cause car crashes. systems place mitigate harm cause- regardless whether malicious. 

Not really sad desperate ‚Äúrussle jimmies‚Äù (and disillusioned accomplish goal yours.) It‚Äôs sad you‚Äôve clearly given fair chance discussion, logical discourse already unwilling actually listen.

Instead relatively isolated outbreaks big cities major suburbs, widespread spreading fast everywhere. starts growing exponentially across board, going able siphon resources affected areas anymore areas getting hit hard time, areas resources manpower stretched thin, happens fatality rates go up.

As today, two younger friends woken bilateral pneumonia high fever covid test results pending (one negative covid, influenza positive ironically). I'm 31 somehow avoided virus first wave half office got hit, I'm feeling like matter time me. saw subs, I'm bit suspicious schools accounting 6% transmission, even masks social distancing (kids super-spreaders), find numbers linked article contradictory earlier examples they've provided.

Frankly, governments probably reluctant admit schools driving case counts afraid closing them. understand would *very* hard teachers, parents, students, yet many countries schools reopened (e.g. UK, Israel), reopening schools seemed increasing transmission. 

I think would lot better governments would come clean it, even close schools necessary. That's trust government especially important time like this, would much, much better play safe, risk explosive spikes numbers. see strike parallels gradual decline Rome (not USA mind you, western world). famous poem written \~800s someone looking wonder ruined Roman city;

I simply expanding saying *only* reason. No, completely utterly wrong.

Members team vocal twitter regular conference calls progress. associated Phase 2 trial paper one Fauci holding congressional hearings. real deal.

So stop generalizing start following along particular team's progress. Conservatives: even shut hospitals full people dying dozens.

Conservatism mental defect. I'd say alot people considering successful podcast world. Nova Scotia months. really problem. restaurant knows name telephone number? Yikes! one remember phone books? Jesus. become majority? Maskless rallies perfectly safe, dontcha know! Sweden stated death rate 52.7 per million since beginning pandemic. *per link* better economically. Denmark death rate around 10.7 per million.  

And course, never said over, made own.

Since well state banned towns banning fracking local jurisdictions. Good info. lol thinking last summer, Florida actually 8th country(after Wisconsin passes today), seven states worse Florida lol, need look per capita, go Worldometers Case Tracker, see cases/million column According Reddit, even Biden himself!, Trump responsible every single covid death US. US somehow immune worldwide outbreak. US really poorly per capita sad true. admit quite bit selfishness myself, working medical office (pre-covid) made feel connected others. Rich poor, old, young, bodies function basically same. everyone dead, technically immune? generation grandparents. absolutely correlation population emergence diseases. come poor practices.

What? *is* strong correlation population propagation disease. quarantine, lockdown, social distancing work. sure addressed anywhere, us needs 60% effective get approval get 40% millions doses, surely country buy them. get dumpster tossed they?

To think, are, NOVEMBER, fucking ANYONE still talkin like astounding, mention public representative.

I'll specifically quote part AI model, Subirana stresses, meant diagnose symptomatic people, far whether symptoms due Covid-19 conditions like flu asthma. tool‚Äôs strength lies ability discern asymptomatic coughs healthy coughs. 

And concern using pre-screening would flag people unhealthy coughs nothing COVID communicable disease. probably also vaccinate people work jobs contact elderly immune compromised Thought states adopted free testing program. Guess not.. Yeah there‚Äôs chance show false neg it‚Äôs better nothing far. say ever tested positive PCR test, antibody test (in February even access PCR?). antibody tests 90% specific even best tests (such Abbott test). antibody tests even worse, like 10-20% false positive. 10-20% chance never Covid deliberately made sick. point happen USA? Would 200,000 per day overwhelm country, need far worse? 

I.e. I've noticed death rate climbed significantly (yet), uptrend. I'm comfortable save asses things went public school nyc 90s back least, quality education pretty damn good. art music high level advanced classes. think days it‚Äôs gone quite downhill, sadly... Dental absolutely bulk billed Quick! Someone bribe guy! No, insofar effect worst scenario. ICU occupancy, mortality recovery rates would better served define ""worst week"". 
Just laying numbers like putting much icing cupcake. Esp since people get virus recover w/o long term impact. guess 4 US equivalent 130 then. Every time get behind wheel car, I'm mercy people's decisions least degree. logic, guess I'm privileged enough live area public transportation viable option get around, see pissing moaning it.

Oh, wait. I'm allowed use analogy ""car accidents contagious."" Nobody going around willfully spreading infectious disease much like nobody driving around trying kill injure someone else.

Meanwhile El Paso ~934 hospitalizations 200+ ICU cases. can‚Äôt even imagine hard single city. really space force, lol. 'huge almost empty country' thinking Canada Australia lol government (and sensible part population) important task educate idiots, de-platform religious nut-bags give hefty fines people engaging disinformation fake news. (including politicians)

&amp;#x200B;

It already cost many needless deaths really ramp up. also many cases death rate? contributes fear Sounds like one case four days concern Vatican then. Power grab. I'm one pretending answers here. told dont know. I'm tap dancing. everything simple convenient solution. 

I dont get car crash analogy applies here. Supposedly traffic laws solution here, yet car crashes still happen. difference however everyone agree traffic laws good thing. 

The issue see it, mutual agreement masks mandated. According cdc guidelines take 14 days develop symptoms positive test result. cause massive problems own, but, still. ""Flatten curve"" 6 months ago. played different party office ""You can't track me, big brother!""

*pays restaurant bill credit card* see Reddit article yesterday ""US Health Dept reports 80,000 new cases, new record""? Fuck, shit brutal 100% people going get infected standing line polling locations. makes even better. god...they make rest us look terrible. think resurging. Seems colder gets worse gets.... I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs ‚Äúanti maskers‚Äù it‚Äôs idiots don‚Äôt care rather, uneducated. It‚Äôs overweight people don‚Äôt quite understand got diabetes. El Paso full poorly educated, sure they‚Äôll put mask asked, aren‚Äôt really concerned otherwise. woman bat shit crazy. Brad Little has, least, tried. limited ignorance opinions facts, much hope. Ada County's hospitals full, health board away mask requirements because, ya know, freedom. one medical professional among totally ignored doctors spoke meetings. cause massive problems own, but, still.  Ad hominems still help you. 

What disingenuous using deaths per capita?

Provide proof lie mortality rate US lower official number. Hahahaha blame mexicans USA....USA...... Everyone close eyes pandemic go away. worked education supply store decided gonna ""essential"" suddenly carrying masks getting wipes hand sanitizer. lasted two weeks closed nobody school teachers coming anything. Crazy. 100% believe stat source I'd love read print Michigan checking in. stores accepting cash awhile, went away months ago. worse mayor Jaws. never said ""Shark's gotta eat."" pushed kids water. Pretty fucked up. Didnt think El Paso would get strike Also, natural disasters typically help begins. threat still persists people fear, many use mental gymnastics mitigate fear, many times blaming victim, ignoring facts denying threat‚Äôs existence. Excellent info, thank  It‚Äôs piece cloth pretty much scientific consensus doctors agree protective. Even turns true, it‚Äôs stupid people willing risk lives wearing one. bet get sick don‚Äôt hesitate go doctor. asinine gamestop die? ...from getting Covid...save asses getting Covid. deliberately misconstruing stating. fair, says life, means life. Chill. 

Flying plane Hawaii voluntary act unless military stationed there, case literally signed possibly battle. like Spain popular tourist destination Belgium? Thank info wait, one here:

you order pizza via phone, ""umm yeah, one number 5 numer 132. name, adress, blah"" dont give tip door . damn, need give restaurant name adress entry? wtf?! omg dying. spy us. communist socialst dictaturship /S examples U.S. limited U.S. sexism problem globally. Even lot progressive areas. need able discuss women's capabilities examples much dismissed.

I know I'm pretty confident still fond lots sexism women there. Proof Americans stupid. shut dirty whore mouth Fuck red lights

Fuck cops 

Fuck military

Fuck seat belts 

Fuck laws

Fuck gov trying make do

- stupid sound saying fuck gov legal authority Federal Gov't this. policy statement (aka worthless piece paper) 58% nothing worry about.

Also masks help anywhere near much think do.. scared, hoping filthy piece cotton going save you, very, very, little fear.

I wear mask employer says to. Otherwise don't. 

Masks new religion many liberals. burden proof work like that.

Can read? made initial claim friend reported everything back normal? didn't. offered proof, accept there're means verification. country reporting heavily censored government remove anything makes CCP look bad, there's single reason trust ""official"" reports. passed high school, know verify something true time-tested way compare independent sources. Stop quoting passages understanding expose moron internet. worse us per capita. eu scum! Like Georgie ghost. me! Yes mandatory state federal government. single state mandates citizen get vaccine outside students even pretty lax exemption rules saying people complying complying? Cuz part city definitely are. collar burbs. think China hid numbers, however fair criticise figures time testing capabilities report accurate numbers. stated many nations though. Im sure US data accurate early on. probably president said he'd never wear one people wear masks show opposition him. mocked opponent wearing mask. who's say side fault... plan run people infect? Yes live near border catch lot american illegals trying sneak usual. 

Sorry buddy, love voted mess, stay How? FYI, El Paso part US. Trump president US. did. TX attorney general announced pursuing legal options El Paso reopen mayor doesn‚Äôt authority that.

Absolute morons. didn‚Äôt learn first tp shortage. Tight. Halloween Adam get immunity though, one gets worse every time things happen people heart attacks

There actually lot people surviving mild heart attacks home rather hospitalized unnecessary medical interventions lead death. 

Thanks COVID, we're actually learning dangerous overtreat patients mild heart attacks.

Medical errors third leading cause death US. dropped sharply thanks COVID, people staying home visiting hospital.  Folks, downvote, read articles he/she linked. getting it. yea. people think specific location specific person interested data, reality, Karen, nobody gives f\*k there. can't differenciate ""you won"" spam mail national public health emergency. brown eye new 3rd eye Supreme Court upheld mandatory health laws like vaccines schools past would constitutional.  Contact tracing. people plane need quarantined get tested. like 70 people office 70 students school. 

If everyone plane wore mask risk low, assuming masks effective. 

But person Covid happens person peed sleeping, bets off. dare ‚Äúbrown‚Äù people El Paso try die?

Fixed you, Paxton didn‚Äôt care Houston, San Antonio RGV either  thought Trump ended Pandemic? Lol Well, I‚Äôm lucky live Marin. EVERYBODY wears mask (unless they‚Äôre outside, far apart). Best part? Restaurant inside dining, indoor malls in-class instruction got go-ahead week. People shame no-maskers here. üò∑ Nah hear sources exclusively get news (the largest network convinced they're special rebel underdogs) keeps them, like many things edits laughter UN, lets hear deflection dreamed get parrot others. Dude people half brain they‚Äôd google search ask Covid cases nearing records Covid deaths aren‚Äôt. 

We much better job treating people, ICUs aren‚Äôt packed even tho cases spiking multiple vaccines gonna start popping November June. Everyone woman child gonna dose want long Texas constitution provides ability County Judges make emergency declaration de facto head emergency management Texas. 

While governor make executive order anything binding needs legislator amend either Texas constitution create actual law. governor refused call emergency legislative session. don‚Äôt think county judges power extended lock down. think power 14 maybe 30 day ‚Äúmicro‚Äù lockdowns. Curious see if/how affects voter turnout. Wonder long ping pong shutting opening going last. Cal represent......sadly haha. It‚Äôs guy didn‚Äôt disclose making commission investments investors currently charged securities fraud Compare Houston see dire situation. Fortunately live highly educated area 95% people wear masks.  trump beat covid right? Indeed, put another way, 10% mankind. live neighboring city that's hour away El Paso. honestly quite scary people pandemic shopping Get test getting plane anywhere? Yeah that's gonna work US right turn we‚Äôre rounding toilet bowl we‚Äôre flushed down. shit show lol course doesn't, he's simple cult henchman.  That‚Äôs sad, especially wife, baby entire family. There‚Äôs end tragic stories get responsible federal state governmental action won‚Äôt least January, hopefully new leadership White House Senate. rounding turn wrong direction wronger direction Exactly. man monster. imagine someone asking 25 years legacy pandemic, tell fought reverse lockdowns helped virus spread Haven‚Äôt heard Second Halloween?! It‚Äôs like big deal. get get flu shot numbers expect record sustained deaths, right? numbers aren‚Äôt correlating. Yeah also massive disruption non-COVID intensive care. someone gets traumatic injury like severe car accident gunshot wound, there's little ICU resources available? mention basic healthcare put hold.

Edit - also see eaja‚Äôs comment often occupies ICUs doom making.

BNO merely observes it. obviously don‚Äôt understand stand politics. snooty. LA getting worse worse. People leaving CA en mass right now. Yeah.

My world full physicians spouses, knew doctors who‚Äôs spouses tested positive rest family quarantine based test.

Not counted cases either, treated positive sent home 2 weeks. rattles bit know even physician spouse doesn‚Äôt matter enough get test. Time invest still better America. 
It's Asian nations beating both. ""Oh fuck yeah spread it"" 100k next week really Wild West there, huh? fact matter Americans like healthcare. knew that's like sacrilegious website, change reality, like reality democrats like essential workers essentially expendable *again*. you‚Äôre saying gonna see 180,000 deaths 4 months? We‚Äôd increase dead 1200 per day, every day, 120 days reach number. 

No. going happen. highest death count last month 1208 21st lowest 339 days ago. 

We aren‚Äôt even trending up. trending sideways even tho breaking records. lot people like complain ""high taxes"" NYS.

Turns put money towards things make state great. One things schools. 

We smart population understands things like science listening experts. therefore experts tell us wear masks, wear them.

Other states like brag lower taxes. end dullards can't think critically decide masks obviously political choice. people end spreading viruses killing thousands people, injuring millions. medical costs skyrocket, pay way money would paid NYS taxes. 

THE END. Man weird... it‚Äôs like teleported back time early 2020 We‚Äôre currently #1 COVID cases Fair enough I'm US, People interested politicians' gender. Boy, Utah sure showing it‚Äôs colors. murder moms this, it‚Äôs ugly scary there. *hides Northern California cushion* tracing completely voluntary comes individuals. Companies organizations less so, regularly work County/Health Dept. 

Essentially, one infectious day get sick(show first symptoms). Testing little different story, overall, 2 days before, going get people might infected, plus non shelter place times, easier remember 2 days 5-7. department concentrate Forward Tracing, try prevent cases. uses Backwards tracing, often goes back further, attempting locate individual infected person. many people infected right now. lockdown strict enough stop virus widespread would result civil unrest like we‚Äôve seen EU anyway isn‚Äôt March, completely making idea moot. People aren‚Äôt mental state March chomping bit reopen aren‚Äôt mindset. second set even stricter March restrictions, expect basically amount civil war. Everything‚Äôs harder second time.

I‚Äôm even going get ‚Äúshould moral perspective‚Äù doesn‚Äôt matter. won‚Äôt work even government willing it. I‚Äôve learned anything pandemic, it‚Äôs fellow Americans fuck everyone else order even slightly inconvenienced. guys called Czar US? hear czar think nobles 18th century Russia. lol didnt read article, name Forename Testing Lastname Czar? This. Thank you.  arent increasing compared record new cases Yeah, whole stand aside it‚Äôs strategy worked well 1940s. Republicans like vote Election Day Texas. like magic thing done without economy collapsing. Working vaccine wear masks. supposed empty, there's Plague decimating country. mean shit, started, dipshit Lt. Governor went Fox News say elderly willing die COVID save economy: ""Mask to, uh, mask up."" really get private sector company dom't need federal government tell right thing. Sort like mask wearing. federal government intentionally supported mandatory mask wearing, yet airlines require still, banning passengers flying comply.

Require test getting plane starters.

They could require enforce like masks, choosing putting profit health community someone Texas little happening shut ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù business. One jackass acquaintances sells ground pools. Guess ‚Äúessential‚Äù April !remindme 3 weeks think middle class wealthy Americans fine healthcare, it‚Äôs entirely different story working class poor. family despite health plan work couldn‚Äôt afford dental except child took child dentist never got dental care. paying ambulance ride months longer. exaggeration. conditioned think need healthcare coverage like it, still costs much people even insurance avoid going doctor. It‚Äôs time us get rest western world get universal healthcare. yes, AMA danger right now. send prayers 

yOu mIgHT wElL gO kIlL tHen!!! checks out, Bernie basically center-left politically  even vaccine, pandemics pass. current system self reliance..we need lazy hangers on. current charge parties followers main attitude. best hard workers democrats leeches. deserve one else does. live bay area hospitals overflowing all. opposite problem, highland hospital forced lot staff use PTO anything do. 

I think first time ever Republicans right, shut mistake. really, seen website loves Bernie? Dude even win primary lmao virus disappear forever actually prolong virus lifetime end.

How contradict two sentences. right, lots people happy people might end dying make lame jokes heard immunity. misinformed also nice people. going on, hospital administrators got million+ dollar bonuses. Fuck everything. didnt. 

Unless Wuhan We‚Äôre type spreader events towards end September would‚Äôve kicked surge? tapshead.gif us Americans real leader, would never gotten control. nah. entire world built environment 2019 times, we're stuck long haul find new ways get people back lives. 

and let's forget vaccine candidates getting results initial batch three (J&amp;J Novavax next two coming), highly unlikely every candidate fails. Lmao run far reality find interesting people view different timelines. asked April 2020 thought we‚Äôd September, optimistic things would control. we‚Äôre rolling November completely pessimistic feel 2022 overly optimistic things return ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. 

Even vaccine found safe, talking prioritization gets first, effective different strains, long lasts... many people even get it. Again, I‚Äôm pessimistic. Masks proven useful, can‚Äôt even get decent compliance. Pre-covid19, anti vaxxers hay day. Measles whopping cough problems again. people suddenly going board new vaccine...? doubt it. Nothing response US gives confidence life return back normal next years. 

The thing control myself, protect family, continue isolate. I‚Äôm fortunate position able so, there‚Äôs way believe things safe 2022. truly hope wrong. Yeah made meet every two years civil war. Intentionally trying make government ineffective possible reconstruction Main transmission via air droplets though? highest death count? Canada socialized healthcare. country broken.

Vote! 40% one province ( Liege). call Bergamo North. care

 Fox News busy trying report President cares, he's busy downplaying speak

 that's kind caring

 yeah, see liberals always lying! much small government Ah okie well less immune really unfair statement make right decline antibodies seem translate decline immunity yet. need research done Black Friday gonna us in. People selfish greedy, care hurt long get sales.  THAT'S FRENCHY WORD , HE'S COMMUNIST foolish quickly pass this.

Which already scientific studies analysed characteristics died controlled age comorbidities determined average, covid-19 victims lose 10-15 years life.  pre lockdown, people without income spending hundreds thousands toilet paper Gotta control beheadings somehow. Saddest winter lives far! EMAILS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

 nobody talk emails Russia gave President's lawyer, President's lawyer trustworthy people? Honestly know. That's ask explain everyone exactly think misinformation. part headline headline whole looks sound me. Maybe mean minor slight terminology? can't find wrong less willing explain reasonable seems conclude statement substance all. Coronavirus going space!!! Yes probably due increasing knowledge physicians things work don't. Steroids, low molecular weight heparin antivirals really job. Also early diagnosis also helping patients preventing viral load early treatment. I'm American. There's ""We"". sarcasm directed fact yet another media outlet saying 'the majority Americans feel this, want that'. Unless actually surveyed 328 million us can't assert ""majority"" us feel one way other.  


The article indicates asked 1,002 people two days(26-28OCT) basing assertions that. That's 0.000305% US Population. those, 581 favorable mandate. 581 people (0.000177%), two days, 328 million people. That's hardly majority. 


As far national Mask mandate? Hell no. People freedom please. wear mask public right now? Yes. legislatively forced to? No. many know shut death sentence

Not literal death sentence like shutting down, ultimately things shitty killing people help understanding risks ultimately okay risks.

When spread infection killing people well endangering yourself, furthermore El Paso around 95% hospital capacity, idiotic asses end ICU means someone else dies either COVID accident can;t get emergency care. 

But yes try compassion. Compassion means killing people sustain business horseshit twisting into.  could still months enough made get vaccinated. Hopefully multiple vaccines make production use different production facilities speed rollout. Iirc, plant India able produce something like 20% vaccines world, made 600k per day. They're multiplying coronavirus, even making vaccines US, would still take long time make enough vaccines everyone country. Less 50% population gets flu vaccine average.   
So ‚Äúmost‚Äù don‚Äôt.   half do. tester 3 times. First one nurse two last ones (nose, throat, saliva). always got time next Day. result game back next day.

However smaller cities heard difficult places. think word translated ""mallet"" *paliƒçka*. word Slovak diminutive form *palica*, means stick. *Paliƒçka* = little stick. I'm hoping election ripe time flip, excited vote year genuinely wonder they'll hit 1 million day. manage bar. We‚Äôve balls wall busy every weekend since we‚Äôve reopened New York. Halloween busiest night year (sales higher NYE large margin). We‚Äôre expecting capacity night, clocks setting back open extra hour (3am). It‚Äôs fucking insane allowed happen. Damn, America, wild! Adjust Wisconsin‚Äôs cases Belgium population even start wearing underwear 19 lol convince way. I‚Äôm west El Paso, I‚Äôve seen 0 change. Racist smh  Agreed, population density Belgium one highest world. comparable huge almost empty country like US. Available wealthy food thought:

 bet Trump running President France, he'd call Macron ""Macaroni"" accuse Italian. ^This. Taiwanese wear mask anytime. Right? problem virus one‚Äôs immune system ever encountered before, builds incredible levels body detects metaphorically go Scorched Earth order counter it. teach body detect fight earlier drastic immune response won‚Äôt necessary. Five years COVID19 really ‚Äújust another flu‚Äù. (I hope) üëå I'm neighboring NM coming vote next week, bad getting? Holy shit right infected sewage slightly nuttier taste usual. Kinetic energy kill vehicles, propulsion explosives included experience introverts generally understand concept introversion extroversion better extroverts - pet theory: told lives extroverted educated ourselves. Extroverts never challenged needed understand. 

I would encourage educate him, maybe understand people different feeling right roughly similar feeling pulls one social events. kill stupid people?  I'm starting okay this.  


We've one Sturgis Motorcycle Rally yes, two? first lockdown lethal

 lethal lockdown 

 TNA TNA TNA Oof. hope Alabama. numbers unmasked morons greatly increased now. Bidet, man, bidet. entire job, wow, really makes difference. lolll anything middle ground type probably over-represented here, comments like fucking everywhere almost sub  guy method acts Hallows Eve Eve Eve now, America event hit second wave yet Europe dealing right now. Pretty poor translation. ""F√∂rs√§mrad"" past tense, ongoing.

""The situation rapidly deteriorated"". 

I'm saying believes stopped deteriorating, still huge difference ""has rapidly deteriorated "" ""is rapidly deteriorating"". BNO News probably ask someone read Swedish want translations. see. that‚Äôs still stick use view. Make strict strict rules close don‚Äôt comply one one. It‚Äôs result truly voluntary claim. flying anywhere soon, you? probably dumb question, T-cells eventually reduce reinfections severity cold, need booster shots for? cold vaccine right anything like that... agree. Communication always first often problem find grow older. also failure way life.

I remember black white tv. born time internet. born society let go rigid social circles people would exist in, called that, literally translated 'columnization'. Catholics went catholic schools, churches, sports clubs on. Protestants, thing. political parties.

This phenomenon collapsed mostly 60's. grew free society. ICT get information many sources. However, become decadent relativistic think experts topics make verb corporate name.

We question much including science. science divided many fields sub-fields one follow longer. Virology specialized. ever talk real scientist? people hide universities labs corporate labs. news outlets take announcement new drug run cheerfully, truth subtle say.

Normal citizens longer follow science abstract, far removed daily life. become matter faith 'believe' science. Especially 'experts', choosing cherrypick sustain bias, always finding another conflicting story (pseudo) science.

ALL relative. causing ourselves. Science one voice amidst many. fewer fewer people actually understand methodology science. 

People question facts tomorrow that, one day might be.

Scientists need learn communicate better explain work, so. also science never exaggerate world flashy stories aimed invoke emotional responses new normal, fewer people patient willing listen.

I blame science also governments. government? people understand science. Political parties often scientific bureau sort whisper ears world works. government properly educate about, besides, someone partyline woven intel, many believe it.

We accepted ICT criticlessly society relative question matter attitude. must afraid 'fake news' propaganda, conspiracy theories even compete right. foreign influencing elections on.

That wonder real threat face today much Covid-19 virus lives networks connect us: information.

Information alive. wants known, wants spread. linguistical problem, viral problem.

In 1950 government said wear mask, would oppose it. gone sense collective extreme decadent individualism.

We infect questioning authority, factual information means sabotage other's resolve.

Covid real threat. are. way spread conflict media. dangerous virus. feel like saying beginning, people want pandemic play like disaster movie. Except doesn‚Äôt freaking disaster know prevent it.

We shouldn‚Äôt responding high hospitalizations deaths, preventing them. question, fact. It‚Äôs psychological. It‚Äôs need hoard alternative. fear it‚Äôs basic necessary body function. Yes, technically alternatives toilet paper: wipes bidet, example. don‚Äôt work various reasons public.  good making vaccine, represents ""scale risk"" get fast distribution, knowing vaccine yet effective. ""at risk"" part manufacturing costs lost vaccine fails effective. early data showing positive immune response patients certainly encouraging, real questions protective patients, even low level, remain determined. ""we ready"" stories pharma shortening delivery timelines much possible running manufacturing line final results, essentially parallel phase III testing. 

I would caution read anything positive, negative, kind story. preparing deliver vaccine clinical benefit gets approval. could still fizzle effective. course, like you, hopeful Moderna, someone, makes approval something meets minimum standard efficacy clinic, would love get back normal someday too. likely buy necessities. lifted lockdown way early. Austria reacted fast initially, almost immediately opened again. like this. scary hell us ignorant situation aggravating hell surrounded people completely underplay disregard situation in. NH too. People FREAKING privacy PII blah blah blah. 

I know people don‚Äôt bother making reservations anymore, information require reservation. It‚Äôs big deal. hey. might save life, get back utilizing rights freedums. survival rate 99.4% 18-29 group.

My dad 75 worry survival rates 220x worse people range (86.8%).

Those odds fucking suck shouldn‚Äôt ever even hear words ‚Äúlearning live virus‚Äù ever leader. Good news: wearing masks! too. downside, visible ventilation room (doors, windows closed) even though first appointment, place already full customers (I guess open earlier appointments 9). would love introduced country doctors (""experts"") said covid nothing. notably one dentist pretty loud second wave somehow disappeared. air super dry Southern Texas humid? think humidity might what's causing spread places others. Might explain El Paso Pheonix struggled much compared southern states, Midwest seeing really worrying spikes Yikes they‚Äôre bad bad many volunteers want reinfect multiple time sampling anyway Idk man, New Zealand seems control. Actually did. happen again. Viruses win every year every hemisphere....this one actually warned 2007 remarkable paper Hong Kong virologists. Another virus possibly adaptive contagious mutations emerge. Maybe life time 73 yours. Also, already difficult contain super bugs. hospitals waiting chance. lost newborn one year ago bacteria resistant known antibiotics. sent organism CDC. hear nothing hospitals want type information out. next problem addressed.....your rhetoric one informational enlightenment seems norm days....

Gatorfan Wisconsins population 6million basically half Belgium's 5k cases today probably similar positivity rate Belgium. want really bad per capita daily increases look North South dakota, Tough year politician. I've heard good things him. Ill back someday Australia! Congrats?!?  ""A mandate law! breaking law telling can't come store select groceries. discrimination. Instacart curbside pick equivalent. disability. illegal HIPAA ADA ask disability is. going sue you!!!""- every store cashier, security guard, hostess, barista, fast food worker cop hearing ad nauseum anti-mask anti-vax Trump brigade. Worse. r/im14andthisisdeep Soprano, obviously remember back May averaged 15-25 cases day, went 18 days without death.. kinds people even think exists *now*, makes think they'll behave differently 3rd? They've probably known people died yet still play off, many continue do. They'll delude thinking whatever get selfish pricks. ahaha normal democrats. ok. 

let's look plan- free college healthcare- things Norway Scandinavian countries have.

increase union membership- Iceland happens highest percentage union membership country world. 

expand social security- robust social safety nets whole idea behind nordic model.

his entire 2020 platform heavily based Nordic Model plus beefed climate plan. lowering economic disparities expanding social safety nets two core principles model, sure platform ""not that"". nowhere close soviet communism even democratic socialism. 

anyway take word  Republicans gotta keep genocide going... praying going hurt dead? care someone prays something? Spent Saturday evening friend suddenly developed severe symptoms Sunday. tested positive following day. I've mild cough shivers Wednesday that's it. PCR test results yet. Since Friday feel completely fine, likely mild symptoms all? expect things get worse day now? zero cases live. None anywhere near us.

Yet downtown (smallish city) lost every one businesses due governor's order. wide open now, ghost town downtown. single shop, cafe, bar, theater..nothing survived shutdown.

Our hospital laid workers patients.

It's interesting.

Even cases anywhere near us, get required COVID test every two weeks due job. 15 min., every citizen positive test mandatory 10 day quarantine 1600‚Ç¨ fine violates Wait, isn‚Äôt shutdown good thing? saves lives? can't consent. ANYthing anything, yeah pretty much. could called emergency session Lege wanted ... going that, would done back March April. since would run counter GOP narrative ""it's flu, big deal, reopen state, anybody says different trying undermine DJT"" ... um, yeah Sorry, clear. text call multiple times -- every 15 min so, limit. let phone run batteries (yes, I'm dumb ass) came knocking door within two hours. boy Dan good job. mean Belgium probably worse situation Czech republic. see cases positivity rate growing much slower almost stopped growing. hope near peak. I'm deeply worried coronavirus mean future. scientists recently said pandemic may end 2023. Nobody knows certain will, economic recovery take years regardless. number cases rise, several industries able completely recover rebound previous growth rates. ""back normal"" anymore. Oh yes, blame guy currently charge blame guy charge? Makes sense country?  Yes, also inform results Yes. born firearm. need people guns, cannot everything required functioning yourself. permission others guns, collectively agree taken away murderers, taken away inside court, allowed airplanes, etc.

You life, need firearms it. Water necessary life, collectively ensure access water. Guns necessary life, ensure access guns together. Negative liberty much smaller two, inherent humanity like say conceive spirit.

What know negative/positive freedom made comment? comment first time heard distinction? read Wikipedia pages, Isaiah Berlin essay? immune average JAV take much them.

A quick reference. he's Supreme Leader good things!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 bad stuff Democrats We‚Äôre going quickly skip past 100K/day don‚Äôt start getting handle it.  HODL CoronaCoin importantly they're running trials multiple countries across Middle East Asia. people understand continue deny airborne virus.

Indoor settings nearly every situation, potentially dangerous. Good point. Upvoted. really understand reply. trying make point actions put others greater risk ourselves. Reaching top shelf. Onya Dan. idiotic suggest countries respond responsibly suffer fate North Trumpistan .

I sorry suffered - happen. mucho family fun Sounds like difference approval general public getting dose. Serious ? Belgium located France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands. geographically fucked. lot strangers pass country.

The reason, well, corrupt government. President may actually tell like least country second wave expected mostly experts. People didnt expect second wave much. want people stay home, pay them. I'd stay day literally work live. I'm taking care myself. Feel bad single mom dad working two jobs coronavirus rages.

But, like said, that. Look long taken get measly 1200 parties washington. care think fault, one payment 7months helping anybody. Summoning skeletor! Australia checking in. see movies people wearing masks audibly gasp, remember filmed pre-covid. recently lifted total lockdown, masks still mandatory. would livid government lifted mask mandate. can't argue science. Also they're single dose, speed trial. far. Watch space....... Murdoch press probably give hard time too. Technically, masks/distancing best things order prevent spread get infected. 
Vitamin appears best thing prevent severe outcomes/hospitalizations become infected. lot Parisians also second homes country. spent last lockdown second homes instead city well. seem assume tested positive attended rally. evidence presented substantiate assumption. case 12 days hospitalization able narrow direct exposure two likely acts. one in.... pure speculation. tell making case political theatre folks spend 9 12 days intensive care bit annoying.... thankful alive, home oxygen anticoagulant. perspective retired physician also bit different looked realistically. going contain spread virus... anywhere. Even New Zealand Taiwan Sweden. eventually win.... hope family safe

Gatorfan 31% positivity ? tests symptomatic people :D

So... federal government already announced covid vaccines free want one Important distinction Hart Island COVID victims were/are buried next kin whose families cannot
afford funeral. It‚Äôs done 150 years. weren‚Äôt sending anyone there. Plenty homeless Austin. go grocery store, 3 highway overpasses pass multiple tents out, directly highway along outside retaining walls. every time go, seems. Joe probably see bunch around town... said country, officially recognized masks wear helpful limited way worn wrong, useless. also used short time effectiveness diminished. people keep buying stacks masks. Low incomes cannot afford to. people put things token.

So. base studies! least people hamstering toilet paper longer save Germany... Someone tried tell NYC dense Korea like lmao seoul one densest cities world small price pay.

Besides rents 30% housing becoming affordable. started building friend hospitals immediately getting big increases cases, happened US president telling us fake news. he'd definitely centrist Europe, right that, idea Europe representative entire political spectrum absolute bull, nearly entire goddamn continent concentrated neoliberal, pro-capital governing body CANNOT without offering aid. People die without income well. can‚Äôt afford housing, food, electricity, medications, many things without type fucking effort motherfucking government ANGRY. Ya work lor air force people nah? two? Waiting another Great Flood guess

*side eyes global warming* Look whole country France. Macron basically promised wouldn‚Äôt go back lockdown &amp; choice. Even looks imminent Italy. true - that‚Äôs thought well Oh fuck, 100k end next week options work people actually cooperate. That's we've trying entire time, **but people still fucking it**. country ""national leadership"" mask mandates greater good right now?

Edit: even ""uniting country greater good"" pres' job. People that. people worried shading helping. economic hit economy takes pandemic. Every economy world felt lockdown no.  really believe saying pity you. Honestly yeah, I'll say it. fucked up. assholes dying, plenty assholes get live spread vulnerable among us die. Even assholes dying still cool. cost? lockdown destroying economy people‚Äôs mental health?  Daily deaths 1000 past 3 days. Idk numbers Austin full people still coming town, bars open Halloween parties galore. According White House accomplishments, covid it‚Äôs handled.  Well, last week, accuse doctors faking COVID numbers somehow get paid treating COVID cases. basically resulted every medical association US telling screw off. self-reported.

2016 showed polls usually inaccurate. likely foreign migrant type worker? Given location? 

It‚Äôs guessing. You‚Äôre right won‚Äôt know. Businesses trying level best ""essential"" lose money. workers paid price. Fake news? understanding, China made mistakes still good job warned world time. believe would much worse virus originated US. It‚Äôs piece cloth face.

/sarcasm Diggin coal buildin walls? Yee Ha let's pander morons build obsolete economy. Yeah that's going for. seems Wyoming habit occasional data dumps accumulating negative results (there seem many instances several days reporting positives) RIP people worried shading helping.

lots us helping social distancing wearing masks...its really big deal China physical distancing anymore, everything open. there's community spread, transmission rate way 3. recent factory outbreak infected hundreds people anyone showed symptoms. Fortunately discovered contained. rip homie Americans getting back normal regardless government demands. Sure states majority ignore virus go life like already doing. Oh bad - thank you.

A comment mentions 250k + cases day - that‚Äôs likely we‚Äôre headed unless get proactive collectively.

We learned nothing countries. Nothing. Yeah virus much deadlier bc therapeutics vaccines think expect us

I'd hate see another repeat Dr Acton Ohio treated. reactions mask mandate probably make worth it. situation like trust sense community valuable assets society has. forcing ""skeptics"" wear masks might wear masks also become even skeptical authorities society get polarized followed decline trust (both authorities citizens). probably also sob story someone gets fined wearing mask trying get person hospital something like make ""skeptics"" even convinced right get sympathy people fence.

This entirely accurate.

The federal government cannot provide relief state taxes. CDC hypocritical; can't it.

In fact, ability CDC spend money controlled entirely Congress.

March/April style lockdown, lot places adapted takeout previously. could still get EOTHO scheme discount apply takeout only. idea get people door restaurants bars. nope evangelical christians sad. think current pandemic, people need little understanding. get crap people realize that. ""They argued ordinance unconstitutional masks proven effective.""

A common argument masks is, ""They're trying see much freedom take away. What's next?"" looking back 100 years, true government this? No. article putting people jail giving fines. presumably restrictions penalties lifted never came back.

Can officially retire slippery slope argument government testing us see much take away us and, whAt'S nExT?! anything, government gotten lax this. way state, county, city 2020s would put someone jail wearing mask. That's laughable, would myself. frankly incorrect. capable confident completely united states literally 4th place world covid deaths per 100,000 people

europe whole far fewer deaths per capita family owns illegally smuggled artifacts iraq committed customs fraud. talking Macron ‚Äì also found source would support claim, right? Interesting take. Thank you. last comment someone asked ""do even know anybody carona?""
 
""Do even know anybody who's seen jesus eyes?"" Here's latest case/death charts Florida, running 7-day currently 77.79 deaths per 100k population, ranking 10th per capita (President Trump visits farmer's market Bangor, Maine) NY here.

Everything closed months apart essential services.

If welding people apartments breaching basic privacy entitlements way stop Covid, yeah, let rip. People said weeks away 2k daily deaths since July 4th. July 30th 1851 deaths, since May. Since come close, barely started exceeding 1000 (where September).

7 day average daily deaths 1000 since August, 2000 since April. never going go back April levels. Let go. 

Sometimes feels like subreddit actually wants people die. Young people drive spread. Alcohol drives spread. Halloween night parties get drunk. war bots, round 10000. Start. Belgium: 

First, dual income families relied family members grandparents mind kids school daycare such. impossible.

Second, people asked - obligated! - work home, plenty parents faced demands employers whilst minding kids lockdown.

Third, there's argument closing schools severely harmed development children exposed family abuse situations, schools act social control mechanism.

The net result conservative minister education going ""schools need stay open costs"", vocal liberal fraction went ""businesses need stay open costs"" past moments.

Belgian employees rights, course, comes flexibility, employers pretty much demand people come office. Many thousands businesses done exactly premise ""employees need work office"", never mind risks, even though perfectly work home. mention jobs - e.g. shop keeping - practically impossible (the whole, ""what essential business"" debate)

The net result significant fraction people needing school educate kids, also mind force demands employers.

At time, government discussing lockdown, much possible schools businesses remain open everything else shuts down... would borderline criminal negligent gamble take turns giant hole virus keep spreading.

Many people angry, frustrated tired horrible display leadership past 8 weeks. How‚Äôs saying fascism go? ‚ÄúWrapped flag holding cross‚Äù? Ron DeathSentence Yes. months ago old CS teacher posted exact problem teaching FB group.

Yes every asymptomatic person takes cough syrup every 2 hours too. havent eaten outside inside restaurant since last March. take every week damn.. miss served hot food nothing clean up! could started anywhere. still talking crap. US dominant force world many many years. response covid late. time hospitals full, many people sick system handle. 

This horrible predictable scenario playing out, listen scientists, believe people every reason lie you, get burned... case... get sick die. Hmm, guess right. Kootenai Health hospital northern Idaho 99% capacity week ago, can‚Äôt see situation gotten better tho. Positive sense RNA vs Negative sense RNA.  Get grip, even structurally same.  teach high school now? Speak yourself. I‚Äôll enjoy higher salaries, lower taxes best-in-class healthcare available US.

They‚Äôll probably get unreleased vaccine like Trump gloat beating virus. 2020 shown us live selfish society. It‚Äôs like masks work something. Showerthought: coronavirus charts perfect occasion math teachers explain exponentials, derivatives integrals (e.g. total deaths integral daily death curve) Haha. Every place sketchy Teriyaki street site, that's say they're good. :) think using PCR tests June cases went up, people like made bullshit talking points, deaths shot month later? think one through. Eh, attacking strawman. said helped, necessary sufficient. *is* possible defeat riskier prior. refute point need argue fewer Chinese tourists would ipso facto *detrimental* better outcome.

Cases point. January Hebei (province China) passenger flow 14m Chinese people ended grand total 372 cases. two provinces next door Vietnam, Guangxi Yunnan, 25m 36m passenger flow, total cases 260 212. Even assume 30% interprovincial passengers half incoming (likely higher less developed provinces), Chinese arrivals outside January would still million province.

Edit: also, Hunan Henan literally border Hubei, yet they've 1019 1284 cases total. happens 35th, 40th patient comes in? virus spreads exponentially, numbers add quick. add beds still shortage qualified staff spread existing staff thin. 

Not mention, people still need emergency care services car crashes, heart attacks, strokes, etc. One year free rent exchange seven years destroyed credit score doesn‚Äôt seem like great bargain, means actually gone bankrupt weren‚Äôt paying rent hell it. want leaders   yes yes yes! feel like last years chaotic base..and .just classless. Hmmm, 1 millon sounds right me. Reading need make-shift ICUs brings picture large military tents ICU overflow ... winter ... ugh, it‚Äôs gonna long, cold, deadly winter. Thank goodness. many us non Americans worried all. well. government acting like care, passing something quickly headlines, failing think big picture. cries third world restaurants area even google maps, much less website Dog books. Walking guitar. Hot tub cannabis oil. Good things. Crazy people spreading covid bad. miss anybody except dead. know many people suffer prolonged damage now. know that, Captain Science. 

If 20 30 year olds got sick went infected others, that's big if, that's irresponsibility blame. mine. I'm responsible immediate family. We've taken plenty precautions, I'm happy report single one us gotten sick.

You're quick call others ignorant time sprouting whole lot unproven bullshit. kind funny. pays people treating human right? idiotic, looks awkward af resurgence 

""a process something starts grow, develop, become successful larger usual number events similar, often bad, type, happening within two words essentially synonyms... except ""resurgence"" refers *second* subsequent ""surge""/""wave"".

So, context ""resurgence"" literally means ""second wave"". best avoid well. I've used Uber times dont use things like Door Dash whatever hundred ones bring fast food door.

We need UBI people forced work jobs benefits suck money corporation. implies cases detected time infection. Virus shedding occur weeks.

Cases function testing strategy (not volume, also gets tested). Deaths relevant statistics. Facts  Idahoan here...this gal nuts squeaked Lt Gov win (R).

And someone ""whatabouts"" regarding latest terror attacks France, generation ago ""Christians"" running around lynching black people south trying equal rights different. They'd almost certainly still could get away - oh wait still it! That‚Äôs necessarily true. Covid-19 causes inflammation, even asymptotic patients. It‚Äôs well understood medicine uncontrolled inflammation cause lasting damage tissue. (Hence autoimmune diseases, like lupus, cause problems even without active inflammation). 

One biggest issues understanding virus specifically causes profound immune response. Patients develop Multisystem inflammatory syndrome far sickest patients I‚Äôve ever seen. Thankfully, getting better treating preventing severe immune response.  masks help 1918 pandemic? Given sheer number deaths, think not.  Surprisingly everyone south beach wearing masks..the beaches almost empty. restaurants requires masks get in, bars like restaurants. clubs closed.. Really? exactly like ISIS? Lmao. Last time checked. Woman drive vehicles without fucking beheaded. 

The fucking delusion. oh no...why happening? everything wrong, happening? obamas fault? Antifa? sky wizard angry gays? None stupid little fuckers. people, people, refusing listen sound advice. point really care. C'mon plague inc, it. #CornonaForever 24% positivity rate? holy shit - high back Feb / March? someone suffers Multiple Sclerosis, honestly say can't see easily outside point view, mean going cause serious repercussions coming years. Truly frightening. true , im south one took anything seriously getting flooded infrastructure. extremely normal deploy high schoolers still school hospital work actually think CDCs fault. think think necessary health people. However, another agency government needs counter balance decision appropriately. 


Hunger health problem country forcing grocery stores give free food people. provide people food assistance currency used grocery stores. Nobody listen person.

If mail-in vote, drop ballot box. put US mail. Look positivity rate Italy. testing obviously maxed well. belongings,

the vatican's gold faucet fittings alone cover lots pastina I'm part Pfizer trial, last appointment go Nov. 2nd. first September 3rd, actually got vaccine. So, experience, literally almost done. 

Also side effects: nausea, slight headache, 6 hours getting vaccine. Went away next day.

Thanks. There's balance covid deaths poverty caused deaths. Another massive lockdown would cause latter, well covid deaths moment reopen I‚Äôm sorry. safe, get hands N95 kn94 can. Florida doesnt covid restrictions you‚Äôre getting mad fantasy love guns, agreed. Shit strange. mean, posing book gun classic religious extremists world. Texas, despite smaller population california, **and** less testing

Has cases deaths california find articles like deceiving hopes cause fear. headline states 'Kootenai County hospitals near 99% capacity day mask mandates lifted', state 99% means 31 32 beds full, 31 hospital beds occupied county 170,000 people bad all... communications issue well. border town, huge minority residents watch Spanish language media, including social media. Could getting mixed messages. Could lack testing? Yes, schools can‚Äôt contain it‚Äôs AIRBORNE virus kids room 9 hours day without n95 masks

Don‚Äôt clutch pearls I‚Äôm following scientific recommendations. fair even conservative subs, despite craziness, respectful average Twitter comment. Twitter vile. ""That's ridiculous"", said.

""The US absolutely hitting 100K / day"", said.

:-D I'm playing, lol.

The US clamped hard right original post, surprise delight, ended peaking July 73,000 cases day. Ironically, expected thing October, somehow refuse now. suspect quarantine fatigue time around.

Also, point model clearly incorrect. assumes exponential growth, seen states rise exponentially new highs, point growth ""fairly linear"" state intervenes falls off. people idiots, state starts go crazy, certain percentage people start careful somewhat self-correcting. Republicans, lost fucking minds.


Sincerely, rest planet. Dude inform yourself. Italy lot better countries like France/Belgium/Netherlands.

We even top20 countries cases/deaths per capita. I'm sure every country doing. know UK done. mentioned, getting worse Oregon too. sure Washington. hope figure though, one deserves without healthcare. It‚Äôs awful. many buddies mine ripped families fight CoVID19.

First wave got, second wave ok, now??? P v ¬¨P answered, ‚ÄúSee one deceives you. many come name, claiming, ‚ÄòI Christ, deceive many. hear wars rumors wars, see alarmed. things must happen, end still come.‚Ä¶

These people acting like Christ-like really deceivers. offer little context here: seven human coronaviruses, four cause mild URI typically carry significant morbidity mortality, developing vaccine good use resources. 

SARS basically thing 15 years, course vaccine that; much point developing vaccine disease basically exist outside labs anymore.

MERS caused grand total 2500 cases fewer 900 deaths eight years; again, that's really going high priority vaccine development much common diseases vaccine development going significant impact.

You're free distrust pharmaceutical industry; that's prerogative, lord knows they've unsavory practices past. also important upfront context behind significant interest developing vaccine class viruses that, recently, posed significant *persistent* threat public health. good we're lot tests minute positivity rate evening out, lowering one day rising slightly next. filled much hope good sign half measures taken last month may actually somewhat impact [Sorry Google people know protested got tested quarantined afterwards.  American Taliban (not us district) started person classes again! Great timing. 

My sister teacher told ‚Äúkids can‚Äôt spread adults‚Äù COVID positive kids classroom. 

It‚Äôs complete insanity things get whole lot worse. things see twitter look nice really look scientific makes difference Czech Republic Finland? hope feel alone. lost many people year I've lost count. 2020 one hell year man. people listen scientists.

Can imagine many could saved everyone wore masks? I‚Äôm fucking north Idaho shocked bat shit crazy looked. US didn‚Äôt go lockdown. Certain states did. Certain states fuckall. certain president still national unifying strategy. end US things operating like this. 6 months thing something pulled ass. didnt wear masks every flu season before? ya know flu different R0 value death rate, still every year chance contract illness small chance die. leave house chance contract illness small chance die. thats life. everyone scared want walk around mask everywhere unknown period time Ah, see miscommunication.

I think advantages means better. go online pick food delivered me. lots entertainment options. people work home. 

We need people it. it, better. need real leadership. Well Trump said need stop fearing virus, really logical conclusion. wanna know coins went cough, r asymptomatic?  Brace yourselves. ""Herd immunity, lol!!!"" people coming yabba dabba doo That's fine, needs this, would it?

Part problem interpretation hospital capacity, people report hospitals surge capacity infinite staffing. Neither true. Sharing information npr piece talks puts us path understanding true issue, imagine priority deep state conspiracy prevent released. Something fascist phrase ""securing safety"".

Like forest creature set traps ... Working home positive. Mostly. countries afford healthcare citizens america can't?

edit: also asking rich people pay taxes they're legally supposed pay (in america's capitalist society) 'communist talking point'? ever think anyone represents group people, particular crazy woman ever cares herself. shut raving lunatic.

Touched nerve, I?

Funny forced resort pathetic ad hominem attack rather address argument.

Let ask nice clear... ""herd immunity"", spread COVID19 Sweden come end Sweden? end goal FHM's ""strategy""?

Or Tegnell plan COVID19 endemic disease person entirely misplaced self-confidence quite little misinformation troll. 

And yet utterly incapable disputing argument. No, tell President acts  Technically true. prediction spot-on: Rounding corner horizontal vertical. Lol why? Trump says control. [Obviously Jason &amp; Scorchers Well selective breeding natural selection. Candy cannon. Toffee trebuchet. mean, it‚Äôs going on/off switch moment vaccine approved, I‚Äôd hardly call ‚Äúhopeless optimism‚Äù expect get lives back vaccine widespread availability, expected happen springtime likely knew cases would spike afterwards.

They probably didn't. Presumably, assumed would cause bit uptick cases, understand exponential nature virus' spread.

All scheme end give small temporary boost restaurants' revenue ultimately helping bring second lockdown going devastate sector.

The hope Europe keep case numbers manageable level order buy enough time vaccine arrive. would meant encouraging population reduce risky activities, stay vigilant, rapidly ramp measures back infections numbers start climb. course, nothing sort, back square one, keeping economy life support getting harder lockdown. uncle got pretty well building selling plastics company (auto industry) 80s. housewife. Ever since then, they've selling timeshares Florida. made ton bad investments years still try make look like they're well off.

As cousin wife, lawyers doctors get rich; pick practice based ethics money. Anybody link article says lockdowns effective? I‚Äôve looking while. much there. sure shit spewing? EU, cannot get single cent name form benefits. health insurance either. Maine still plans re-opening bars. Actually complicated. That's point. reddit get shit complex degree /r/corona mean shit.

To point early fragments mean squat didily. likely die nose hairs infect let alone kill. 600k 50M dead probably. 20% imported cases. percentage tests came back positive. Dear God coronavirus determined epidemic one point. addition standard anti-transmission measures (like wearing mask), also got first flu shot 30 years month. rich tho, couple dragons pretty neat piles money. American people poor people places, yall aint got shit. bad carbon monoxide argument. 
It‚Äôs even worse anyone compared actions governors pre post personal covid diagnosis? yeah, part problem. Extrapolating average 2 regions like Hawaii Florida leads somewhat inaccurate conclusions. 

I knew govt could step time change graph. can't extrapolate ""a change direction""... goal predict policy decisions, can't really math (except maybe machine learning). Since US heading up, extrapolating 100,000 mathematical given. could extrapolated 1,000,000. see I'm saying? I'm admitting know made error, error retrospect, modeled linear growth states hitting peak. probably ""on pace"" hit 100,000 day August 18-23rd so, Aug 8th like said, knowledge change policy would knock us course either date. 

I think 100,000 almost inevitable now. might barely miss it. Policy changes delayed effect least week, there's certain amount momentum daily rate. linear growth model would take us 87,000 day 5-7ish days average, weekends lower, one weekdays next week probably touch 100,000. would take 2 weeks average 100,000 day, policy change today could easily take effect then, vast enough. midwest seems determined make policy changes point, tho. 

The US half million new cases last week. 560k so. realize death rate much lower im still kinda sad all. That's equivalent 180,000 US cases, looks like Spain may overtake US per capita basis soon, like Belgium Czechia done already Sorry, I'm loop here, what's positivity rate? shitting me, right?

The full sentence "" Sweden **will have** high level immunity number cases **will probably** quite low"".

High immunity causing low cases. That's context claim. reinforce claim, spoke Finland - much lower number cases per capita - stated would much lower level immunity thus much higher number cases.

You're one ignoring context suits you. Look, honest I‚Äôm really denialism, don‚Äôt feel need go bat Washington Post‚Äôs methodology this. anything I‚Äôd expect bias *against* reporting high compliance rates, favor pumping up. going way New Years Day. Every weekend excuse break quarantine bubble socialize even bigger group ppl. Unfortunately, public tired pandemic willing engage high-risk behavior, especially 30 without kids. 

It's like drinking driving. Unless there's high-profile campaign drill public's mind morally wrong endangers innocent, ppl treat like jay walking. Remember, took generation public advocacy put tough DUI laws effect, convince ppl socially unacceptable. 1. Testing virus known largely inaccurate multiple tests coming back wrong.
2. multitude people undoubtedly showed symptoms? 
3. ""set communities affected protests""... sampling pool necessily people PARTICIPATED protests.
4. article HEALTH SCIENCE written ""a team economists"". commented detailed comment, link dump misleading, many things guy said factually incorrect. yes default started looming horizon. there's lockdown situation seen Argentina/Uruguay one seen NZ Australia Maybe, tbh still think would better now, least McCain professional respectful. see point. know anything Koontenai county. Saying 31 170k hospitalized also bit misleading focus article medical resource availability. Perhaps saying ""Kootenai County Hospital occupancy reaches 31 patients"" would better including somewhere 32 beds total would better. wonder people would say holding Quran AK-47 one buying $6 beer takeout restaurant go liquor store instead. gone crazy even Idaho standards. Please think represents people State. Since taking office behavior become erratic. running office, went debate full security detail hired. first warning sign. Since promoted right wing militia groups, conspiracy theories coronavirus denialism. majority us share views. Round 2. *START* Zombie apocolypse end 2020? 

I'll take it! ROC curve bit concerning. Accuracy falls quickly reduce number false positives. 20% non trivial. Also, I‚Äôm surprised didn‚Äôt use large amount negative samples sanity check.

The features used pretty funny though. Basically covid diagnosis could making people emotionally distraught cough lol. wasn‚Äôt really clear collected data positive test. like last 10 years? picking early fragments stopping someone spreading infection. complicated.  Oh even worse eeek study SARS patients (I believe hospitalized patients, specifically, might mixing another) lasting T-cell immunity 12 years fact. point well-taken antibodies may last long, incorrect suggest SARS immunity vanishes 12 months most.

Second, ""strains"" talking mostly different minor mutations; there's evidence suggest clinically significant impact immunogenicity memory.

Third, interesting paper published Science two days ago pointing antibody responses consistently last least 5 months disease.

So let's go links below:

The Harvard Gazette piece say immunity lasts 4 months; said easily detected 4 months infection, different statement.

Second link example reinfection; indication common typical immune response profiles are.

Third link discusses study methodological problems looks antibodies anyways; every academic commentary points out, that's looking one aspect immunity.

Fourth link study purely asymptomatic individuals; appear asymptomatic individuals lower propensity develop antibodies immune memory symptomatic individuals, clinical significance far known, particularly seeing individuals *asymptomatic*.

Fifth eighth links handful reinfections; millions cases, people sufficiently low-level responses permit reinfection. That's biology.

In essence, misinterpreting overinterpreting many points, factually incorrect many rest.  really enjoy seeing kids won‚Äôt handing candy weekend. normally buy 15-20 bags candy, that‚Äôs many we‚Äôd get, often large groups families. seems risky. I‚Äôm teaching remotely extra candy take school 24% positivity rate means waaaaaay higher 31,000. can't test enough. someone run president issue respect response. admit I'm somewhat confused conflated ""number deaths due Covid-19"" ""political differences"" though.

If I'm reading correctly, think handled Covid well, due promoting strong message projecting trustworthy persona, consider death toll Covid state ""political difference"" irrespective respect him? 

It seems handle Covid *directly correlated* many people die watch. preconceived notions guy, I've never heard speak, odd hear two seemingly conflicting pieces testimony back back. based theory vitamin c deficiency corrected vitamin c. theory around lot longer Paul Marik.  u think Great Barrington Trump dying covid What? Thx! consider amplification person's statement probably stay social media probability easily influenced. kidding me, anything make play victim card 100x before

They still think republicans better jobs, spite seeing major economic crash ensuing job losses every republican president last 40 years, steady job/economic growth democratic presidents. ""Love thy neighbor^1""

^1 they're straight, white, Republican. swear described distant relatives Montana yes professor. Please tell us instead answering question question like pathetic devotee system beliefs. never saw anything ‚Äúover‚Äù. saw people pleading others little things impede spread (social distance, wear masks, don‚Äôt go bars, don‚Äôt go large parties, don‚Äôt gather inside) fewer people would die.

Being able gather groups outside incredibly beneficial. temperatures going people inside uptick obviously going happen. hope prayer cases rate would go summer inevitable increase colder months would either delayed bad. Well Europe blew hope water. day gain insight feels like directly experience deliberate genocide country.

Trump agent death. individual freedom go bankrupt break arm. ya, completely different country side. also wonder data collected birmingham. stuff like means nothing without methodology discussion section go it. anything positive comes Either lead water. I‚Äôve heard people work several occasions state can‚Äôt wait Nov 4th rolls around coronavirus disappears. It‚Äôs insane I'm already lot pain  current administration *literally* mafia study seems based theory Yeah shit Dont forget olive green matte paintjob really hammer home ""tacticool"" look.

BTW, ISIS provide contraception sex workers, ostensibly keep working. Meanwhile, court cases even providing contraceptives women US.

Montana would rather die ask help OK, I've taken pandemic seriously whole time, isolated much can, dismayed anti-maskers. 

But part still questions well governments know people. Even shut country 8 months... then? reasonably connected world, like Belgium, still risk spike. would shut another 8 months? another 8 months? what? People going listen, they're going die.

If geographically isolated strong trust gov't, like New Zealand, might doable. really wonder end game Europe Americas is. Wow. discussing comparative metrics general make Tegnell. it? Paul Marik, study based theory maybe pivot something else better unemployment thou.... least back giving extra 600 bucks week.

That's hardly decision make time high Run forest run right fuck office please  ever thinking hitting Celt downtown Idaho Falls, don't. owns it. know exactly one Germany.

God save us.... therapist almost 3 years moved Idaho couple months ago family. hope ok. üòî Ugh nc like too. dem gov SUED repub lt gov spring lockdown worse doubt Yeah, way back March 'could September'. means absolutely nothing they're actually mass injecting people effective vaccine. Covid's state depends whether president still Trump not. Trump still president, Covid longer exists defeated virus. Biden president, stunning abdication duty 400,000+ deaths January 21st, 2021 resign. feel well. Half US already Covid fatigue right now. 

I‚Äôm saying give false optimism drop social distancing guidelines effectively immediately preaching there‚Äôs end sight we‚Äôre gonna years isn‚Äôt gonna get people doctor‚Äôs side. Reforms access affordable healthcare outcomes qualifying individuals. hugs :( Translation:

It also noted supermarkets able sell essentials.

These ""last chance"" measures Prime Minister Alexander De Croo puts it.

All measures constitute common basis. Regions take decisions. Wallonia it, according Minister-President Elio Di Rupo. let us note Brussels Walloon curfews change: 10 p.m. 6 a.m.

These tough decisions taken simply catastrophic epidemiological situation Belgium. shown figures collected European body ECDC, country highest number new confirmed cases per 100,000 inhabitants average 14 days (i.e. 1,600 cases, double France, Netherlands 10 times Germany) second highest death rate Europe (more 8 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants last 14 days, behind Czechia). situation therefore critical.

For authorities, must also noted measures close bars, cafes restaurants curfew imposed everywhere (yet) expected effects curves. wrote, Wednesday, Belgians still moving much. state affairs also shared KUL doctor microbiologist Emmanuel Andr√©.

 Hope alright Austin! know lot bands trying small gig- socially distanced shows right now. I've seen bands fundraiser type shows, selling limited seats offering buy zoom shows, trying raise money record new music. They're saying Austin getting hang it. Music food seem Austin's life blood, must incredibly hard times there. know tough everywhere lost SXSW people already put big orders food merchandise it. Hope local officials handling better here! think so... April still far guess situation be. Stats:

Ironically, usually claim they're patriots literally nothing LESS patriotic helping kill thousands fellow citizens.  Never human history pandemic lasted forever, reason think current one different. hopefully midway crossing hardest part, since historical examples ~18 months seems reasonable bet. compared past better knowledge, better means, better hygiene...

So, keep spirits much end sure . Try work (working out, learning, reflecting) complete nutjob either way. god asks pull arms humans worth worshipping. sometimes think US country without grown ups looks like. Responding comment appears deleted comment. Yikes. Might want look tad see answer one. Moderna's. Look differentiated approach. Look patent challenge lost. Read trial results paper; tactic others.

If typed true, would second biggest news story 2020. not. guess not? goddamn, Americans dumb. Wtf. tell Wow, someone lives shit ass state, work covid unit well family members covid. fucking tool.

A lot people. Vanilla Isis crazy fast spreads. again....making political job serve protect. Insanity. best food that's good takeout cold sandwiches like Jimmy Johns stuff least Calgary masks mandatory best. Thanks Covid plague now? Plagues caused bacteria, Covid caused virus. ignorant one again? Why?

Idaho fuckin' rocks. let Trumpist shitbirds scare away. Signals ‚â† dog whistles

We signal tribe belong to. agree guns+Bible-mask=symbolic communication rather rational discussion. try decouple biases cultural signifiers intellectual disagreements w people. path you‚Äôre suggesting leads war.

This guy way smarter me. give read time, promise it‚Äôs worth really hope guys watch video, he's saying makes total sense. People become selfish cannot comprehend giving something help someone else. says either ""\[sacrifice\] 250,000 peoples freedom everybody sacrifice 14 days. know one main reasons UK failed response despite island people isolate quarantine asked cannot comprehend taking kind sacrifice. please explain more. I'm set beliefs, I'm type question everything. acts reset switch. lets numbers go hospitals catch get empty beds, replenish PPE, etc. can't contact tracing high number infections have. 100k new cases day, let's say past 5d came contact 50 people, that's 5 million people call one day. Plus chase contacts. Oh one picks phone unknown numbers anymore even billion people tracing, one's going pick phone. absurdly large percent population thinks hoax anything call them. quarantine like wear mask.

But get numbers low enough, yes (like countries have). US going - thus far nobody certainly wants now. India 3 times population US yet half infection death rates, even half critical cases US. consistent months.

And times India ever close ""98k month"" September 11 16. 

India hit 25k mark within 3 months. US hit 25k within *3 weeks!*

And headline OP misleading compared context BNO's tweet.

The US consistently extreme global rates far, bar none FACT. pandemic shown health care U.S. treated matter national defense. Covid 19 exposed huge soft spot U.S. nation state, even worse, smaller terror organization understands fast U.S. would collapse virus percentage points worse covid 19 introduced American society. biggest aircraft carrier fastest fighter jet would useless helping situation. Even U.S. could track destroy entity introduced virus damage would already done. every citizen equal access healthcare produce PPE pharmaceuticals domestically nation safe again. Trump outdone, next time tear-gasses people wave bible front church, bet he'll go USA flag-draped truck gun hand. Maybe shoot protesters running tear gas. Freedumb. Yea, longer get donuts. Well fair, business expects total shutdown economy government! guy disingenuous implying something businesses planned for. one inner circle thought, ""maybe much."" like Germany? Schools still open restriction movement. I‚Äôm italian too, idea hell you‚Äôre talking about! schools reopened September 15th; don‚Äôt know universities, hometown opened today. I‚Äôm sure understand word ‚Äúexcess‚Äù means phrase ‚Äúexcess deaths‚Äù. Excess deaths means deaths expected number deaths time period. expected number deaths already adjusted population demographics. 2.83 million deaths 2018 growth consistent 1.2%. 2020 would expected 2.9 million deaths. CDC recently pointed 300,000 excess death count. instead 2.9 million deaths, count end 3.2 million that‚Äôs factoring last months 2020. Expect 2020 total 3.3 million. We‚Äôll almost half million expected rise deaths. fucking know won‚Äôt. They‚Äôre nazis waiting orders. solution shoot thus killing them? anyone sets foot house winter, windows getting opened. That's sure. Would rather house cool 45 infection free get COVID! second time, im accusing dishonesty. Im senior level chemistry student one thing drilled heads collect data perform experiment matters reliable results also interpret them.

if self reported, matters
if small sample size, matters
if sample randomly chosen chosen representative, matters

how understand that? mean, seen Mitch McConnel recently dead violet hands? /joking course, likely blood thinners fall/ Ask people french church... Oh wait can't, head chopped We'll see deaths follow increase cases.

lmao fucking late October we'll see plays out, again. again. Yes, imagine happens every state per capita. friends like won‚Äôt ‚Äòliving‚Äô much longer. Good luck! Also truck? personally stance well.

I could tolerate wearing masks essential businesses like hospitals grocery stores, 
doing things like running errands going shopping myself, personally don‚Äôt want wear hanging friends attending social event. 

That‚Äôs opinion though, maybe I‚Äôm selfish feeling way. situation happening landlord mortgages? Also, fact sits lecturing slowly lifts hip shows camera

Asymptomatic people **have virus** symptoms. That's definition ""asymptomatic"".

I guess proved point even further. Honestly, take away flag high standard living could Russia see state state IHME site - go predicted ICU admissions see many beds expected available COVID patients. I've checked availability numbers HHS numbers (I think that's get them) well ICUs seem match up. whatever that's worth.

Felt obvious enough already Canada I'm afraid, specifically Alberta. cases 10 per 100k population rising alarmingly rapidly, provincial government still sitting hands anger redneck voter base. infuriating. Rt site tries adjust testing density calculating implied case load (rather detected case load). said, model estimate, different models comes different conclusions (including many show Mississippi Rt 1). 

Mississippi high positivity rate (8-9%) consistently high models see indication cases rising without detection - i.e., number missed cases consistent past 2 months. Ill take come room exactly go around disapproving CCP. 

Categorically incorrect

[China 180,000 protests day 2010, around 500 Kong's protests allowed continue **a full year** without casualties. Despite attacking civilians, killing elderly, throwing Molotov cocktails law enforcement, single protestor killed.

Yes. laws punish criminals things harm people personal gain.

Why acting like strange concept write laws protect people, punish criminals break delusion masks solving driving incredible hatred towards fellow man.

Why lying position? Put straw man away, one wants watch fuck scarecrow.

Mask wearing one several measures fought people power personal benefit. Instead allowing people continue spread ignorance, stop them. Instead trying defend like are, call out.

And idea anti maskers driven hate this. science. bunch witches oppose scientific methodology? even know tankie is? implying, loan. I'm saying government spending borrowing $18k per person US hand $1.2k. $16.8k going exactly?

The thing helps PTSD, apart MDMA (look up), taking people happy state mind, sports proper nutrition full vitamins, minerals etc. Make forget it. Otherwise we'll generations kids adults prolonged PTSD debilitating state detrimental consequences career life.

With news bombardment rushing all, healthcare professionals forgetting tell patients going ok. even, person overcome covid normally, sneeze cough, constantly think ones die.

Wrongful death avoided acting like asshole, hiring assholes. mention standing front osha rep, jobs literally cannot done following osha guidelines.

Meaning would cost 5x much, industry would die. understand following common sense workplace safety, take entirely far. jobs dangerous, that‚Äôs average tradesman makes average guy front computer. Covid19 also called SARS-CoV-2. know exactly mean ""virulent"", covid19 may exactly describing haha. shitty thing probably 300k new infections day right milder symptoms get missed soon? might well cancel vaccine orders, believe long-term immunity, is.

1 1000 Belgians already died it, five times go finish first Covid-19 round. That's implication made. said liable treatment. read Bible...

inherently 40% ""remote"" 2 months.

if find problems, start think fixing next semester. I've warning months. point people going begin evaluate personal risks longer complying lockdown orders. fact life. working age people 2 3/1,000 risk death (much lower 34), faced reality able feed kids and/or lose home, going take risk. Heck, would take 1/10 personal risk even 1/5 make sure children provided for. conspiracy theory, human nature. 

Therefore, desperate need alternate approach blunt lockdowns. personally disagree every respect, rather they're going work much longer. two cents! Spain Strain. Maybe take condescending attitude shove don‚Äôt even understand fucking LANGUAGE 2nd. favor guy reread 2nd. say right firearms, say right bear ARMS? arms? stick sharpen arm? Sure is. allowed keep bear it, yup. need someone else make said arm? Nope. use said arm defend life liberty? Yup.

The second saying right (through property rights, negative right) bear weapons guy. include cannon? Sure times founders. 

Maybe sit fuck assume know guy studied poli sci top university don‚Äôt even know text 2nd negative rights include right property, includes right traded. Put cunt list ejection...

ALL people turned backs science empathy.... List every goddamned name, make new goal learn everything needed put asses politics good.

It sadly work them, happen notice public servant rode short bus science way Chumpsville might get watch beg look shit scared. Actual fucking monkeys, friend.

Shame essential stores get limited sell. understand stuff = trips, production, etc, also provides people options home activities occupy time (and thus improve compliance). People think covid liberal hoax severely overestimate competence liberals. Almost every place Europe Americas time, Dakotas time now. serious condition first doctor orders EEG

Can ask why? What's side effect people non-serious conditions EEG scan? UK, tip. tip hairdresser ubereats. Plus payments done food comes can't even say keep change now. get tested? majority people wearing masks accordance guidance? don‚Äôt casually pose bibles guns appreciate even slight bit sanity would hope ""essential"" workers would get well, I've worked entire pandemic seen people work job getting sick virus, store stores soon chain found ""safe"" so, reopened standard hours said fuck safety part.

I someone test positive virus store.

I decouple bible gun coronavirus Red Tribe - makes sense. context, politician knows exactly speaking directly us additional message somehow ties whole identity pandemic belief. exactly thing author discusses. 



What I'm trying say is, neighbor owns gun fine me, Baptist co-worker fine me, politician hook deliberate messaging. lots work year stop ""hating"" outgroup makes sense can't extend politician intentionally, cynically, seeks divide people. I'll ignoring talking neighbors relatives co-workers waste energy. 




Thanks link; could use editing brevity I'll add resources. 

... WE'RE PANDEMIC PURGATORY NOW!

If idiots would wear masks everybody got tested could less month! Nice job politicizing basic health precautions! Ask local government. Im paid government. getting bad neck woods people complying regularly? Honest question. correct ‚Äújust surviving‚Äù. moment though get past this. continue live irresponsible, selfish life everyone suffer. going take personal responsibility sacrifice. I‚Äôm talking first born here. responsible take simple measures stop spread. Maybe city acquired immunity country helps too. people around back then. easy forget now, that's Reagan two terms office. militarized people political force, they've gotten entrenched since then. Ehh, 0.8% positivity rate San Francisco.

Maybe send North Dakota tests. Get ready Murica. got next. North East US periphery major metro. owe let know surprised. Redress who? Property taxes still due matter what. city offering payment plans still pay amount full end plan. Fuck Idaho fuck bullshit dirt-tasting potatoes! Buy Maine potatoes! Anybody two braincells rub together.  lol new hotness got Idaho ranked really low education years. miss it.  step back moment impressed John Smith eight years ultimate goal?

A Mormon controlled White House.

*muh gold plates er furm gurd* brain fog month got virus. don‚Äôt feel way anymore though. I'm talking federal government whole say ""they"". Society whole dragged lowest common denominator. understand survival fittest means, really believe implied stupid people would dead already Bibles guns... Yeah Jesus would definitely AK 47 guy. get paid good wage must mean everybody else gets paid good wage right? cant happy good wage like you?? Elected officials elected make decisions -- sometimes even unpopular decisions! -- public employees carry out. Maybe thinking governing arrangement. course was. criticized right, knew it, see negative clearly painting it.

It's *exactly* like telling toddler big kids carry security blankets around public, toddler throwing screaming tantrum literally can't imagine life without binky. Lockdown 7 days in, lockdown. understand come early 2021, Americans evaluating personal risk - grand majority workforce extremely low (as 2 3 per 1,000 chance death) - begin defying lockdown orders large numbers. 

A 30 year old picking (1) personal 1/5,000 risk death, (2) feeding family getting evicted, they're going take 1/5,000 risk. Hate say it, know would came that. 

I get selfish choice, shit really start hit fan economically, going happen. **People kill save families**.

Therefore, really need reevaluate approach better realize economic impact going get really messy continue ""blunt lockdown"" pathway. science based anymore.

Testing practices changed dramatically universities started testing everyone campus, often twice week. tests became significant fraction testing performed state.

This deflated positive rate since population tested constantly. keeping rate lower, governor kept opening things full speed despite fact cases obviously increasing, deflecting criticism pointing positive rate still warning limit. heard Covid-19 likely going like it‚Äôs coronavirus cousins mutate slowly too. even vaccine wears eventually confidence boosters would effective. 
This opposed flu vaccine involve best-guess every year strain prevalent sometimes it‚Äôs swing miss. Gabbard lot questionable supporters, including right media Russia. assumed intended pull votes left third party, ended liked enough work. Meanwhile, China already working called force majeure, reasonably unexpected situation, beyond normal situations encountered. courts declaring *moratorium*, effectively created *force majeure*, may allow landlords seek redress well.  that‚Äôs regulating clothing, it‚Äôs regulating act public around others  legendary Ron White coined, ""You can't fix stupid"".  Harsh, necessary. They‚Äôve already shot past peak hospitalisations first wave. may brain dead Financial experts predicted years though. anything new unfortunately. vast majority Americans live paycheck paycheck sort emergency fund. Financial experts recommend least 3-6 mos savings. 6 mos savings lost job March would run cash last month hopefully able bring sort income past 6 mos. People lived close edge financially massive emergency hit everyone. rent bubble still going burst point going really, really bad. Hopefully takes weeks. would rather Lincoln republicans pretty much want keep Idahoans out. ;) openly admitted authority. cops following law, judge not. illegal Texas shutdown lockdown anything anywhere. governorking that. considered small government governorking issue unilateral executive decrees override every locality state order make sure business protected people cannot be. correlation explosive spread open schools hard reconcile belief. Ya can‚Äôt like WA. Lt Gov..*checks notes* ...quit without notice joined religious order...well least didn‚Äôt deny covid-19! Quite strict measures, think work. Also country Europe dare close schools, even one week. plenty examples case. simply cops believing law instead public servants enforcing law determined constitutions. Someone create satirical political ad this, see prediction comes true. I‚Äôm curious now. Trump's terrible ideas, Space Force clearly best. Closing bars restaurants seems much important locking completely. keep people industries water, least able breathe, financially, work.

For future pandemics, lessons seem be: 1) Immediate mask mandate, exceptions, fines wear public ... ""liberty die"" crowd get used it; 2) Close bars restaurants pay employees stipend survive; 3) Major guilt trip private parties, much else do; 4) Keep schools open long can. went r/conservative last night many talking liberals full hate...now I'm sure liberal reasonable something else, I'm really sure left's position would lead one conclude party hate. guess people think Antifa destroying cities across nation. making vaccine sound like beer work. evidence one way another yet. probably never researched anything life except quick vaccine ready, hey shits n giggles Google FEMA camp locations America, check manned operational, see crematoriums barbed wire facing inward, go stick head back sand follow MSM closely! Joseph Smith? New Yorkers generally head straight 91 Vermont.  Maine mostly gets Masshole refugees John smith? mean Joseph Smith?
He actually ""run"" independent 1840s folks know that. I'm looking forward chief getting hauled court. lot people get it, binary process. get immunity things gradually get better. Hopefully stays way It‚Äôs absolutely bonkers different denominations political party now. point split different parties? shouldnt see surges cases, right?
From 3-4 deaths NYC, 12-13. Thats 4x saw summer. compassion affected much possible. starting see lots areas decide gets medical care. happening Utah, Texas, Belgium, Poland, more. choose, right first people denied care elderly, pre-existing conditions. first voted people actively worsened spread?

I want anyone denied care. going choose gets care doesn't, evaluating criteria use. name last time christian terrorist beheaded random joe totally different person made cartoon jesus?

You want provide evidence specific terrorist incident? name last time Muslim terrorist bombed American abortion clinic? [Or formed supremacy group based around argument. original point hypocrisy many people America widely denounce Muslim extremists qualms letting Christian nationalism slide... large enough population immunity, exponential increase. That's enough people immune, *people change behavior reduce transmission*, rate new cases slowly decrease low number. 

**If** average, every case infects two others, takes 10 days average...

This whole argument like saying ‚Äúdoctors kill patients forge death certificates money‚Äù.
Nobody believes either argument. 
What everyone believe fact hotspots surging again. South Florida, NYC, El Paso, Chicago, etc throws whole natural ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù window.
Oh 1000+ deaths per day AGAIN. Seems every tiny inconvenience become HUGE personal affront, witness increase road rage years.

Well, guess that's one positive way spin sending best America govt deserves. tried looking old threads time Fauci recommend masks Reddit's search function sucks. specifically remember people definitely took Covid seriously (so anti maskers today) calling people idiots doubting Fauci saying wear masks. saying regular people trusted handle masks effectively masks would make things worse. kinds people feel follow anything. would asshole anti-maskers! 

Never mind literally idea compliance rate masks is. cases going up, MUST people wearing them. true mask wearing works. Oof that's still good. Maine live Korea, remember family worried Korea. ten times death rate. US police force socialist hypocritical government organization country

\- true capitalist society would get choose police force pay market rate. US police forces government funded cannot hire police force enforcement.

\- Police highest participation unions, essentially local chapters ‚ÄúWorkers World Unite‚Äù

\- claim risking lives look statistics cops shot civilians vs. civilians shot cops. Citizens ones risking lives interacting military force.  one asked forced police officer

\- Police regularly use positions help family members commit crimes. many ‚Äúcourtesy cards‚Äù use every day?

\- Promotions based merit tenure local organizational politics.

\- one commits crime, entire police force nationwide bands together defend them. Imagine doctor committed malpractice, every doctor country went TV ‚ÄúBack White‚Äù, doctors special American flags made show support, malpractice suit twisted ‚ÄúDefund Doctors‚Äù boogeyman. think might confused propaganda, friend. People US allowed guns preserve liberty rise oppressive state. People US allowed guns toothless Gumps think Rambo. 

 

Similar, same. military flying robots kill whole family 20 miles away. rifle's going help. I'm sure get 1/5000, I'm sure people incorrectly accessing risk common. I'm talking federal government whole say ""they"". 

Then hopelessly naive.

Different people different levels types authority. could get situations like without one hypocrite.

&amp;#x200B;

However, possible identify least one hypocrite case.

Feel free blame President here, one executive authority relevant agencies.

In particular, Trump's authority military DHS led misdirection funds wall, authority CDC could exercised end eviction moratorium. (He cannot independently relieve taxes, could enable evictions without Congress.)

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, misdirection funds inappropriate, believe reversed court. Federal courts, course.

Spending money responsibility Congress, authorized neither wall additional COVID relief. sense, Congress consistent well; action either wall COVID relief.

&amp;#x200B;

So appears federal government whole neither hypocritical inconsistent. contradictions driven entirely one office, even courts intervened. second wave advanced public gathering limits impact?

I think that's even dumber people said masks help. 

The virus mostly lay dormant extended period time, lockdowns almost immediate effect minus days incubation time.

when lockdown right cause incredible amounts unemployment percentage total workforce. Yeah know 20% unemployment looks bad temporary numbers 80% workforce really carry country long panic cause massive control outbreaks force hospitals ration care.

Once start overwhelming hospitals really putting people edge shutting economy much significant way purposefully putting small segment workforce unemployment.

If overwhelm hospitals take minimal mitigation efforts going wind another lockdown whether think not.

There lot problems way Florida handling data, distinguishing residents non-residents isn‚Äôt big deal. 

The biggest issue need doctor request test non-resident. you‚Äôre resident, state testing totally free requirements. result, positive percentages non-residents significantly higher residents.

ETA: makes little sense distinguish two. you‚Äôre looking cases/deaths percentage population, you‚Äôre looking number residents. Florida lot people don‚Äôt claim residence state they‚Äôre pretty strict it. *must* live six months year qualify resident. done tax issues. People used like take advantage lower costs Florida resident they‚Äôre strict residency restrictions. It‚Äôs stretch count separately considering many non-residents living beginning pandemic.

Yeah rental housing market stupid Utah right demand is, serious lack housing area cant build fast enough keep demand guess, specially affordable housing right get away whatever want basically - landlords pawn one shitty rental managment companies obviously see number person. I'm pretty sure huge swath population would anything wear DrEaDeD gOdAwFuL masks. 

Also, enough safety measures overlapping I'm sure could come control, even everyone vaccinated, countries shown possible keep infections enough precautions followed T, even though vaccine widely distributed yet. 

Granted, thats idealist notion enough people avoid jumping gun let combined vaccine/ masks/ general safety measures thing curb toll enough covid interfere ability eat buffet different country without worrying wiping family, 40 people may may crossed paths with, example.

Funny thing people least seem ones reproduce most. 

It's almost like fiscally socially exclude people modern society unfair practices somehow incentivize larger families group similar communities. Like can't get ahead welp least big family gain fiscal physical security there's resource sharing basically people back get bind, plus food staples pretty cheap cooking thing.

Quite bit changed since March..... check   order literally states county resources used enforce restrictions.  It‚Äôs funny many people left scoff right wing conspiracy theories yet many origins left. Obama became president, right started believing versions big pharma, Illuminati deep state conspiracy theories. anti-vax gospel many far right far left. 

Sadly, left spiritual home homeopathy new age healing, types snake oil studies back up. skeptical Big Pharma? course. throw money drain alternative remedies credible science backing up? Hell no. absolutely correct. edit range. Yes absolutely, known since March. We're catching aggregate number one near actual. cases either mild asymptomatic.

If really think 9 million anywhere close actual number, tells got 7 months homework get done weekend. Tell epidemiologist IFR 2.5% laughed room. I've reading, people eating even tip giving wait staff hard time entitlement. Shit. 100,000 Nov. 1st sure. even disproportionately effects minorities... must like pigs rolling poop right now. Right, almost every country look start second wave coincides closely reopening schools. Yep, look Taiwan. Five deaths lockdown ever. Economy humming along. Why? Prevention protocols full force citizens cooperating. claims fundamental right pursue happiness. know, think bible states get *at expense others*. counter theory since covid mostly kills people lower remaining life expectancy, deaths drop lower level pandemic. 

There seem real data either way this, trying get any.  That‚Äôs insane. idea let everyone get sick? material needs advertising nationally. Government guidelines still business furiously wiping surfaces like going big impactor. Meanwhile unventilated eateries shut windows keep cold out.

hopefully step enforcement, sherrifs actually comply, stop state blows like others. hospital capacity people simply deserve get sick, suffer maybe die someone wear mask wear properly public.

Edit: mistake, typing fast forgot put (stereotypical southern) white people. symptoms (coughing fever ) report anyone health care capacity.

Hundreds cruise ships still stranded Manila Bay... ok take bait: solution? CDC recently pointed 300,000 excess death count.

Right. number ""excess"" measured against?

What ""expected deaths"" arrived at?

The CDC tells deaths recent weeks compared historical trends (**from 2013 present**) determine whether number deaths recent weeks significantly higher expected, using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). range estimates excess deaths provided based comparing observed numbers deaths two different thresholds, week jurisdiction: 1) **the average expected number deaths**, 2) upper bound 95% prediction interval expected number deaths. 

So numbers ""averaging"" there? participant myself, I‚Äôll take compliment!üòÉ severe lupus, missing spleen, congenital blood disease, lung damage 18 blood clots lungs, also kidney damage. terrified getting it. lungs aren‚Äôt strong enough fight off. 

Honestly nervous move New York boyfriend rock. like small towns worried locked closet apartment months months. Plus worried loud, sound sensitivity issues. used southern hospitality worry everyone cold. anyone speak this?  US truly banana republic days. That's alot deaths remember correctly France publishes nursing home deaths certain days days much higher right? 25M Vaccine Trial participant checking in! would day 3 second shot expect symptoms going forward woke symptoms today last two days doozy!

\- Day 1: Fever night administration earlier day accompanied chills. (Ranging 101.2 - 99.3 F).

\- Day 2: fever day, accompanied chills minor joint pain left hand, fatigue sore throat

\- Day 3: symptoms.

Being second shot dose, symptoms intense. staff warned symptoms would intense since body already trained fight virus already know encounters COVID. means immune response much faster intense first shot, gave fever, fatigue headache 1 day that. 

Of course, assuming got real thing placebo (its 50/50 chance) 95% sure got real thing occasions consider lucky boy. 

Assuming got real thing really proves never got infected COVID since imagine symptoms would far worse (the vaccine attenuated, weaker virus all). Hopefully develop antibodies make resistant even immune COVID I'm woods yet.

I'm getting injections keep getting blood drawn lab work done test antibodies. also keep taking care keep wearing masks everywhere go case. Here's hoping works (although money's bad.) 2036, spelling contest.

He'll say anything make Sweden look better others look worse. look three graphs, sobering viewing... America whole done nothing contain virus - read 89,000+ new cases 915 deaths yesterday, numbers got nowhere go upwards, especially since hospitals soon overrun. Thanks you! Lack severe cases?

Latino here. Lots us dont privilege working home unemployed. Remember next time go eat, order out, something non essential like that. putting latino lives risk, eat home !!! first wave, northern Italy affected area: Lombardy, Veneto Emila Romagna. regions low numbers. second wave regions high numbers.

The real problem many regions south (the weaker ones health system economically) high levels. particular affected Campania similar numbers Veneto March concentrated two specific cities (Naples Caserta). Another problem area Puglia Sicily.

The northern areas however (except Emilia Romagna) continue intense stress. Lombardy serious center Milan (the biggest Italy) first wave Bergamo Brescia. Veneto affected areas same.

In north, however, outbreaks large even Piedmont, today closed schools, Liguria much Tuscany (in center peninsula).

For see result herd immunity. Brescia Bergamo less affected people paid high price first wave. Instead Milan summer libertine.

That said, Rome situation difficult notice good attention population: everyone mask, often FPP2, maintain distances least one meter. hell.. might today. study linked another poster looked people used symptom tracking app. Hard say affected results. Would guess skews younger average probably best captures kind people like sort thing. example, learned type 2 diabetes app record blood sugar levels. sorts options supplementary info, usually record whether tested meal. 

How diligent users covid app? Self reported symptoms may reliable record. think people tested. One people work (anti masker less) sick along 5 others family. husband tested positive 5 won‚Äôt test assuming (probably correctly) positive. Beat COVID, turn news. COVID.

They looooooong history claiming they're attacked someone said ""Happy Holidays"" instead ""Merry Christmas"" them, gay person existed TV, movie franchise that's usually pasty white sausage fest starred woman black man, school sent letter parents/guardians written English Spanish. That's identity politics, society mentally register way subconsciously consider white, male, straight, cis Christians (and, especially Right, vehement American nationalists) default setting. regular tests covered require dr authorize, make appointment whomever test - hospital, drug store etc go.

Well that‚Äôs looking bright side bunch people getting sick dying.  need strike sickout. Careful. Police might shoot laughing white. Yep, good point. AUC isn‚Äôt bad. could picked threshold around 85% sensitivity got much higher specificity (90%), think? graph really needs tick marks. Honestly it‚Äôs hard believe area 95%, looking plot. difference 97% 95% always significant, haha?

But I‚Äôd argue specificity needs quite high tests. theory true rate positives low, &lt;5% least.

Going along this, decision remove significant amount control data keep dataset balanced strikes odd. ways, especially deep learning, train modes imbalanced datasets use data validation. 

Either way it‚Äôs interesting model good use transfer learning. Well thank link proving point.

He basically says consider Sweden second wave majority country affected, point (two weeks ago) case.

You understand might point second wave mean lied two weeks ago.

Just like meterologist says sun Tuesday liar rains Thursday. Trump Wisconsin (one strongest surging states) like three times week. Last time insisted COVID would go away Nov. 4 nobody would talking it. Today still spread falsity positivity rate high Wisconsin great tests them. reality number tests 14-15k daily months, previously 5% positivity rate 30-60% many counties.

Willful spreading fake news insights bullying wear masks. true. state locked mid-March weekend memorial day. Restaurants stayed open carry only, gyms closed, non-essential retail completely closed, included malls movie theaters. Grocery stores, superstores pharmacies open strict occupancy social distancing requirements.

The pandemic bad everywhere, reopened businesses still occupancy restrictions, mask mandate remains place least live, observed 99.99% (from I've personally witnessed), restaurants opened dining also occupancy limits strict social distancing requirements day. one states far (knock wood) never really seen precipitous spike positive cases, hospitalizations deaths.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Couple times day. Knowing many people covid-positive ""inflate numbers"" makes numbers accurate, that's ridiculous. 

If yell triage nurse ""How many people ER waiting room"" *counts* them, there's inflation accurate reporting state affairs. That's right, least 6 trillion dying every minute Know learned Bible?

""He lives sword, dies sword.""

""Inasmuch done unto least these, brethren, done unto me.""  Exactly. ‚ÄúWow, diapers cheap Norway / little spread coronavirus Norway‚Äù Yes, new daily admissions around 33 - around 24 last week 20 last month. 1st wave. still first wave. Like nation. Maybe NYC passed first wave though. Yes, even people like me. Friday night wife order meal, order margarita I'll 2 craft beers. drinks cost meal. Plus tip, adds up. food spending 50%. That's lot money pulled economy. point, I'd love traditional meal, laws allow it. issue CDC ""excess death"" number though, people dont think it.

People kind assume number people dying every year. wrong. USA growing country, Baby Boomer demographic ""bump"" hitting ""dying age"".

That means every year, people dying last year.

So lets say deaths looked like (abstract numbers easy math) ..

2015 = 100,000 deaths. 
2016 = 120,000 deaths.  
2017 = 140,000 deaths. 
2018 = 160,000 deaths.  
2019 = 180,000 deaths. 

So pretty easy see trend there, right? steadily increasing year. said ..

2020 = 200,000 deaths. 

.. would make sense, right? upward trend continues.

But said ""Let's average deaths last 5 years see expect 2020 look like""?

Well *average* deaths 2015 - 2019 would ""140,000"".

And 2020 comes ""200,000"" say ""WOW! far expected deaths, taken average previous 5 years! *should* closer 140,000!""

""It's 50% higher be!""

So little math issue people aware of. screw restaurants, drivers, customers, still lose money. services need die replaced something actually works, they're propped investors.

This make even people behave responsibly pay death sickness insanity.

There must reckoning. absolutely unconscionable.

My dentist wearing mask + faceshield, obviously wearing gloves everything including seat desinfected multiple times

There's basically close 0 chance get infected honestly upvote need good news. That's it. One possible reason right much winter people still till recently, holiday season started. 

But holiday season full swing (at least) North India winter coming (temps 40F zero higher northern areas.) No, don't. lost, like USA.  üí© üï≥ Snopes consider trustworthy. Also, outdated work situation. can't fudge facts call ""outdated."" said said meant it. That's quite interesting way interpret data. seem ignore cumulative numbers? least countries like Czech, France, Germany something right graphs shows us worked.

This even make sense. look spikes *happening now*, mean ""it worked""? 

The graphs even show countries anyway, ones specifically chose reasons 

The following countries higher death rate per capita US: Peru, Belgium, Spain, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico.

Following countries higher total cases per capita US: Bahrain, Qatar, Israel, Belgium, Panama, Kuwait, Armenia, Czech Republic, Peru.

There 24 countries higher new daily cases per capita US. find lot Rounding ~~corner~~ drain go past 100,000.

Queensland Australian states things normal. masks, tiny little risk, hospitals overloaded. even hold event? people stupid. school? reminder too, governor Texas sitting 6 billion dollars aid, last checked spent dime late end September. read article Longform.com past summer written NYC paramedic surge.

So many died home awaiting ambulances crews tied hours outside hospitals trying place patients. 

The writer said crushing crew thrives saving lives. Every one lost ‚Äúon watch‚Äù crushed them, much worse surge went losing month least many ***every shift***, month more.

I saw tik tok day someone ‚Äútesting different masks‚Äù vaping.

Kinda made wonder many people walking around pretty inefficient basically useless masks without knowing it.

But again- idk vapor even remotely comparable here. know probably shows masks ability isolate breath travel... say anything virus particle travel? 
Thought interesting though. Especially since one masks- Trump mask- preformed pretty badly. Wow.

This makes things complicated. one hand, governor Wisconsin *should* introduce new restrictions order deal current surge cases, would make look good politically, would also probably worthless challenged court again, could eventually cost chances re-election.

Yes, one crazier other. 98k cases. 100k looks like maybe reality today  Interestingly enough, Australia excess deaths increase year Victoria severe lockdown last four months opening (and overall, year) actually saw figure suicides 466 2020 468 time last year 2019 (August 27th).

We may well outlier this, however.

I thought sound mind strong mentally - first lockdown happened. **almost** broke completely. second one way? Surprised make Christmas without breakdown. average past 7 days 80,000 new cases per day.

Yeah, ya do? \*shrugs\* 52 weeks still weeks. level? densely populated state New Jersey nearly many people population centers Belgium. New York third density Belgium, California quarter, Texas one tenth.

The closest probably Rhode Island similar population density infection rate.

People need see personal stories like this. death toll rising thousand day makes abstract people.

Eight half million people acceptable loss? Assuming entire population becomes infected? drastic change would compliance measures changed increased. regions affected said things like ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre following recommendations enough right now‚Äù. They‚Äôve also said compliance higher spring.  someone get downvoted fear they‚Äôll slide poverty lose life‚Äôs work. Hear what? mitigation efforts work huge economic penalties? 

That's big lesson Covid. shutdown sectors economy still well enough spending dynamically shift.

In case spending jumps least efficient investments like bars restaurants tangle investments like retail goods home upgrades. Stay home = invest income home goods around home vs going memories return investment.

If everybody stops spending money consumable stuff basically gone proof money smoke instead reinvested upgrades home bought long lasting tangible goods, suspect economy would better general.

When people blow money, wind money offset significant amount hard hit industries.

So, really, there's huge reason fear lockdowns they're really restrictive. Even peak lockdown majority people working essential workers work home workers. 

A lot people imagining like people unemployed half country unemployed even close that. like extra 10% unemployment top normal 4 5% unemployment peak lockdown goes back rather quickly minor relaxation restrictions mitigation efforts aka people probably refer lockdowns like 80 90% people working..

It's lockdown. .. except 85 90% country working.

The term lockdown makes sound like there's lot people actually heavily restricted, that's never worked. essential workers never locked that's huge amount workforce. 

The things really got locked large gathering style businesses events represent big portion US economy, pretty clear fact unemployment never really goes crazy number like 30% really staggering number people working.

I buy idea 80 90% workforce working that's somehow economy unsustainable.

You're going face little bit short-term deflation everything's going settle still employed workforce long pretty big chunk original workforce going see much loss... national level. course businesses industries specifically hit large gathering restriction going take directly nose speak.

Those businesses need subsidies like farmers needed subsidies disaster came way. Beyond large scale lockdowns completely manageable primary purpose stop hospitals overwhelmed. So, high death rate need keep core medical infrastructure functioning coded patients also everyone else needs able go work confidence there's medical care get hurt especially work class blue collar workers much greater chance hurt job. tiktok.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Maybe shooting highest one day record world. yet get 98k think break it. Oh boy.. Fat fucken chance.


The double downers already quadrupling down. talk given governor YouTube Covid response (essentially - freedom answer everything, people die time get it, come live want free!), looked case count, something like 1000/day thought 'thats bad'. pulled population stats - 800k! employee food drink place drive-thru, I'm concerned vague legal definition ""essential""  people vote?! also use technique 10-20 samples combined single test

You can't positivity rates high, since joined tests come back positive wasted test. works positive rates low enough make batch positive often ne need tests batch retested find positive one(s). Yeah well good luck that. magic silver bullet stop spread themselves. CZ went 500 cases day 15k cases day mask mandate.

So effect really limited. Honestly, calling article ""junk science"" giving much credit. Je suis Wuhan.. Vive la harissa! Let‚Äôs pretend sub isn‚Äôt heavily manipulated bots first Merkel predicted 20,000 cases per day christmas, accelerated today almost 20,000 cases. Situation changed really fast. highest death count population size.

That's literally sub hates: heard immunity. mean, even texted it. I've always loved quote Rebecca Watson beginning pandemic. paraphrase: Many people US believed Covid spread like Italy, dare! shortage idiots here. live hardest hit province Belgium seems people stopped caring time ago. Pretty sure they'll order full lockdown Wallonia least next couple days. help president saying nothing worried about. People believed pay price. weird, start many months near over. deliver DoorDash Dallas. went small sushi restaurant today many patrons coughing sneezing without masks eating. really hope don‚Äôt get sick work health insurance company insurance companies covering costs associated Covid. I‚Äôm entirely sure coding friend saying. would actually encourage get tests. 

The issue probably lies fact many Medicaid doubt government covering costs covid related diagnoses People start modifying behavior. saw Arizona Florida Texas. gets bad even Republicans acknowledge it. Even States shut people slowed behavior stopped going much high risk activities. possible hit 200k expect hard hit regions start plateuing soon like we've seen past. possible soft hit regions like northeast start spiking case numbers rising well Why? ok right now. Bunch shit still shut but... Lol

Bit surge right though... good. can't believe hostile people toward comment. understand feeling ""prayer isnt enough"" nothing else, somewhere start. religion actively follow, correct place START, followed action. hatred toward religion unreal. Fuck that. I'm done bullshit. I've sitting inside 7 months done shit. can't expect people keep going along draconian restrictions forever. Texans pussies they're told. That's got here. Maryland here. locked state bit. vape shops comicbook stores fully closed. Couple people got fined throwing house parties, everyone lost fucking mind bought toilet paper. much want keep people safe can't close businesses 1/2 year more. fucked initial lockdown hard kinda deal consequences now. mean people way smarter created models estimate missed cases like 10 1 early phases courts city state decided allow drunk driving? Should‚Äôve happened 10 months ago. I've holding breath since last friday. also think looks could slowering little point spreading equally possible big explosion time. could mantain numbers maybe could avoid another collapse hospitals. IDK, sharing hopes. Teachable moment? Even horrendous numbers people still wearing mask properly even all. People flat don‚Äôt give fuck other.

Something preventable United States like 3rd world country think lot politicians United states least get jail time jobless homeless lot worse sick two weeks. like supporters, hear read tidbit something CDC said, blow way proportion, e.g. early warning try horde masks, early data available show effective masks are, people's pre-existing conditions reason death Covid final nail, etc.. Alright, let's honest here. San Francisco vibrant years decades. tent city underneath every single underpass, mention rampant substance abuse epidemics there. used travel work couple times per year supremely saddened every time.

No wonder people fleeing California... Traffic metroplex still pretty amazing luckily  techies skipped town longer here, bougie nightlife culture existed due tech money dried due pandemic. great loss imo. Actual San Franciscans starting able afford live city again. almost prefer we're LA. Still biggest tier reopening. Bunch stuff still closed. Probably going next tier while. 

Slow steady. We're seeing explosions. Sounds like Joe pretty cautious, made wait ten days get three negative tests. Funny Joe's like ""you can't shut everything down"" super paranoid getting tests anyone coming near him.  West Texas? There‚Äôs Covid there! People faking it. said hoax, didn‚Äôt they? gonna say government asking businesses collect personal data customers okay? people like gonna bend ever liberties encroached on. said summer America gonna settle 50k we'd eventually hit 100,000 day... I‚Äôll accept fact cloth masks work according common sense, difficult test scientifically; likely ethical social reasons. now, think we'll getting next year.

2022 guess. Maybe. Perhaps not. Slovakia? closed schools borders. exactly soft measures.  Nah quite. Might happen tomorrow though. fun trying US run 70+ers politics Boomer generation charge everything else. usa dose sense, financial support, enforce lockdown went unfortunately.   Newark NJ think today Russian here, cities ambulances take 5 days come pick up, system completely fucked. enough resuscitation specialists, (and covid themselves) sleep like 3-4 hours workload soooo big. stopped accepting old people clinics hospitals non-COVID issues keep getting infected there, they‚Äôre told wait. covid, unless you‚Äôre super super high risk - like 80 diabetic asthmatic - nobody cares, nobody comes, nobody tests, nobody checks fact quarantining yourself. You‚Äôre own. Also, antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiviral drugs pharmacies, stock, people randomly buying whatever find.

That‚Äôs public health measures determined.  Mandating exercise healthy diet would effective. Back July, Oxford said quite sure good efficiency signal emergency approval September - almost November neither. Also, Pfizer admitted 32 Infections far whole trial also far away efficiency signal. 

So, please stop put hope vaccines work strategy Szenario without scientific+logistic miracles next months? can't late get mask compliance United States. They're idiots, can't grasp [helium forever. semblance rationality must follow election. Especially case overwhelming vote. Paper way convincing. SARS-CoV-2 spread radar index cases even discovered. Chinese 4% seropositives Wuhan. high rate a/oligosymptomatics extremely unlikely first diagnosed patients real index patients pandemic.

I mean that‚Äôs heroic thing purpose? country act accordingly response pandemic (eg. close borders) deserve suffer it?

Likewise globe respond global heating appropriately deserve suffer it?

See congress needs pass law mandating them. laws get made. president authority anything sort. tell congress stop sitting hands, draft legislation. Pretty simple trust Emmanuel slightly Atlas. political trustworthy. Illinois could put list too? higher rate per capita countries.

But countries overall case numbers compare? 100k numbers day bit meaningless, especially large number new cases occurring months end. one seriously believed it. calendar never going work. successful, circuit breaker could reduce infections levels give United States second chance implement effective testing tracing regimen. 

I think safe assume happen states, enough tests tracers remaining symptomatic infections. Americans cooperate contact tracers. government provide support isolation, people infect family members housemates even test. mass testing asymptomatic, many people cooperate was. Even decrease cases, keeping outbreak permanently controlled requires either radically new thinking (not Bidenism, definitely Trumpism), vaccine, both.

The authors' modest pitch periodic lockdowns reopenings work better constant level social mathematical techniques, work explored questions like one: Suppose town wishes allow 1,000 small risky activities like haircuts, ballgames, academic classes small social gatherings course month. better put activities one half month space evenly? mathematical answer concentrated sacrifice, followed period relative openness, beats sacrifice spread consistently time. size impact depends many factors, typical analysis finds 10 20 percent activity might possible (for amount disease spread) activity concentrated.

The modeled policy basically saying: meet friend park week, meet twice next week. Actual lockdowns work way; limit types activity rather frequency. E.g. meet friend park week, go restaurant nightclub next week. policy goes everything know [*k* Sweet! Antigene used 15-30 euro here, PCR around 75 IIRC.

Could people wearing masks thinking coronavirus hoax get vaccine. Except (not sure Moderna one them) basically skipped phase 2 alone, instead combining phase 2 phase 3. 

Which would lower success rate phase 3. sticking bumholes directly sun inner peace

Well, wonder inner peace. Turns FREEDOM, PERSONAL LIBERTY, MUH AMENDMENTS propaganda that's force fed Americans birth led large group people growing thinking owe nothing anyone themselves. Hospitalization rates convincing. Testing rates capacity could increasing decreasing know. like comply drinking age?

Same deal, federal government wanted tied funding compliance. reason can't here, matter funding tie to. would like anti-choice asses respect women‚Äôs bodily integrity autonomy, guess doesn‚Äôt count here. guess better way express immunity without illness. body exposed lower levels virus defend against, thus building antibodies. vaccine effect sorts. Thank Jesus, we've turned corner virus vanishing. airborne virus. Millions high risk people live low risk people. feasible plan. virus way contagious diseases like chickenpox.   really comparable though. Probably smaller US states achieved similar sorts numbers per capita basis. see...most people already wearing masks. helping. Besides, Fauci already said long ago mask STOP VIRUSES.  keeping transmission rate 1. Every time encounter outbreak, test whole city. Thank fucking god, took forever, poor school teachers working environment don‚Äôt understand this. Everyone already wearing mask... literally everywhere. want? People wearing masks sleep shower? 

The masks obviously helping much. Cases, questionable PCR positivity, continuing go every country state using them. 

The deaths significantly US, focus. treatments improved understanding virus. Yet another attempt associate Traditional Chinese Medicine new age woo. Nothing article actually anything TCM.

Also, wow. rambling non-sense make onto Elsevier? even look first paragraph publish anymore? close things mentioned restrictions leaving home meeting people private.

Umm yea exactly buddy!!. sheep slurp news headline thrown way without using shred critical thinking! pointing flaws los things focusing on. 

Thanks proving point! shit, really!? That's even remotely equal comparison. Wow. Moderna one leading vaccine I'm skeptical about. would much rather take one vaccines. 

But still, suppose good news. There's probably fewer people wearing masks Taiwan nowadays given country Europe. think go get vaccinated COVID, I‚Äôll feel high Vincent Vega Pulp Fiction scene he‚Äôs heroine kind physical world would bars superspreading locations? provisions within law allow national mandate times public crisis. I‚Äôm eating moment provide info actual laws wish. answer. likely think peak 125-150k daily also can't trust official numbers. used Europe guideline numbers would 3-5times April doubt US would allow capacity show 300+k dsily cases. Electoral college: hmmm nah pass... people working high risk professions (doctors, nurses, anyone working pandemic prevention, dock workers, etc etc) PCR tested two weeks check flare ups. recent outbreaks caught kind routine testing really showing value.

When outbreak happens, area affected put movement restriction (basically lockdown country China, China real lockdown much strict) entire population tested week. positive cases, close contacts close contacts close contacts quarantined centrally managed facilities cut transmission chain. Areas movement restriction stand alert there's 14 days straight positive cases.

With current situation Kashgar, entire population 4.5 million tested 3 days. 2nd round full population PCR test underway. may 3rd round.  called science, nothing believe. Microbiology 101.

This entire article misrepresented data, like criminally bad. Nice right wing manipulation facts. CDC actually said:

""More research cloth masks needed inform use ALTERNATIVE surgical masks/respirators event shortage high-demand situation.""

I think anyone running around cloth mask thinks good surgical, medically certified, mask. plenty evidence slow prevent spread. 

This post deleted, since ""The New American"" posts conservative bias spin, title manipulating facts confuse reader; would someone already anti-mask. Look, dexter.... looking efficacy masks, we're looking efficacy mask mandates, there's difference. study public policy, science. target audience average reader, big brained genius like yourself.

This ain't peer reviewed journal, local news source. intended target audience going quibble research methods quality data.

People need mask fuck up, mask mandate lowers infection rates, matter factors are, mask mandate works, fucking mandate masks. Let guess... simple concept big brain... Amirite?

But insist nerdng out, maybe pay attention studies parameters ahktchuaaaaly measuring assume smartest dweeb room. Stop condisending, smart guy contest, attempt get folks take seriously.

Neutralizing antibodies wane sterilizing immunity lost.

And T-cells produce sterilizing immunity. Neutralizing antibodies (from B-cells) target pathogens directly neutralize producing sterilizing immunity person get infected cannot transmit pathogen. CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells identify bodies cells, already infected. means they're post-infection line defense, body infected, virus replicating person generally become ill pass virus on. T-cells useful since responses turn COVID19 eventually common cold terms severity, common cold still transmitted people get lasting immunity common cold coronaviruses beyond 12-24 months. ordered self-test yesterday, arrive post monday, test done afternoon result tuesday poor woman. rest family too, course, fucking hard brand new baby, especially young siblings, recovering childbirth, lose dad top it.

Someone cut - Coronavirus came outside

Let - Initial response would go away.

A months later... - need strong full measure refuse. angry scientists (doctor) china/china-virus (the initial persob gave cut). still dont anything fix it. Ohio ZERO repercussions maskless zero enforcement. police departments publicly said enforce mask mandate real law, rule department health.

Even department health enforcing covid rules. I've reported employer (a restaurant) multiple times multiple covid violations; customers. health department inspects, finds violations, gives management verbal warning. fine paper trail. Uh huh, look mortality rate anyone 80 , super super low . Yes, we‚Äôve high 60 Million, since covid spreads easier flu, 60M unreasonable patient count Oct February. Anything involving particulates simple. That's costs much. know enough filtering know constantly remove micro particulates without constantly clogging filters. Maybe use electrostatic cleaner grab larger particles run rest HEPA. significant thing China also enforcing quarantine gunpoint, laughing concerns privacy monitor location citizen times implement 100% contact tracing. Trump done too?

Not quite extreme need exaggerate, government's process quarantine implementation 100% caught cameras around world, including mandate mask wearing public locations, regular testing screening tempearure least almost everywhere, companies factories hold heaviest period spread, midst Lunar New Year (biggest holiday migration Christmas). monitor tech, merely keep track travel location notify contact potential infected people visit building area, restrict travel permit get medical assistances asap.

Many official news small frame reality, they're showing. downvotes come nowhere. somehow familiar polish television, could notice version news differs source source, TVP 100% controlled ruling party.

I'm sceptical official news, unless state medical sources name researches. Like, 300 deaths mean? Covid something else, killed person virus?

*the Earth flat
*pollution real
*vaccines don‚Äôt work
*the Earth 10,000 years old 
*5G causes Covid-19

Explain.... happened workers?  Snooty? call wanting constantly harrassed homeless people snooty? obnoxious. Nobody wants drive homeless encampments way morning coffee lol.

There's many fuckin people there. People leave, opens jobs. People leave, housing prices go down. job openings cheaper housing equals less homeless. call snooty leaving. Oh great. he's going infect universe. Sounds like demands. Evolutionarily, hosts coronavirus infects, opportunities reproduce itself. reproduces, likely it'll produce mutation copying itself. mutation evolutionary advantage, likely passed continue spread. Masks clearly new virtue signal. üôÑ choice either lockdown year lockdown seems.

No isn't. Month long lockdown, close borders (doesn't work Europe deal disease Union), slowly reopen TRACE, TEST, TRACE, TEST. Local lockdown disease shows ugly head again. Force positive cases Covid hotels/camps (you can't trust ppl self isolate).

How f almost full year mess still capacity test millions time proper contact tracing point time international flights stopped, virus kept spreading, huge problem imho.

That perse issue. need put every person coming plane hotel 2-3 weeks arrival. R-nought far 1.0. So, initial vaccinations coincides springtime people start getting back outside, we'll see things get better fast. don‚Äôt need look like get us back normal. one‚Äôs trying eradicate virus besides people don‚Äôt understand science. Hol up, wearing mask daily bad? wash mine every week regular laundry Again, that's comparing death rate hospitals overrun overrun. 

That's getting better treating virus; rather, whether hospitals overrun. Fauci told expect that. ignored, it‚Äôs actually inflamed promoted vast sums wealth certain corporate 1% family dynasty sectors. Amway grift economic brainwashing desperate people sucked pyramid scheme bought head national education dept. costly outsourcing military ops Blackwater, that‚Äôs one example. positions sides pump here, puts within handful feet guy side.

Easier stay habit putting mask exit car anyway. thanksgiving October Canada, resulted immediate upward spike cases provinces. agree quarantine see high amount mask use NY. 1.) rest us want get sick either, speak yourself

2.) use put grandma hotel room? herd immunity slow anyway. re-infections happen. wanna lock big portion population away - FrEEEEEEdoOOOOOOmmmMmm 

3.) would care grandma? isolation risk possible. grandma - obese, immune compromised, etc. people, big portion population still responsibilities jobs kids take care of.

4.) everyone would wear mask, limit social life while, considerate others - would much better place.

5.) orange head would role model done things right mess Oh okay, that's true. see life getting back normal first world countries, lag countries start helping places. would difficult. Lmao Shouldn‚Äôt wear clothes logic? Sarcasm Nah, straight back obsessing raw number cases again. sure though? destroyed something Feb NY month. Tested negative antibodies May.  Ironically, great way spread virus get large group people small area get tested. exactly dude, downvoting people keep living lives usual vaccine available widely distributed many factors, one actual expertise could give ""chances"", anyone would guessing. Instead, focus seem doing: wear properly- fitting mask, try wear fresh one time go closed areas (like car), check damage holes, wash hands often, avoid enclosed spaces; N95s valves protect others much get one without valves tape valve shut; make sure father's mask also fresh, fits well, damage; talk help car sick, open windows drive; keep safety protocol up, shortcuts. Good luck! Vote early, vote person.  lives matter? Money also buys lot privacy convenience. Folks living Huntington Beach relying public transit shared laundry facilities degree. likely less contact people, even unintentional. No, challenge trials deadly virus extremely unethical. expectations vaccine approved distributed things slowly get better. immediate. summer better, autumn better still, point threat become minor we‚Äôll stop caring it. one report infections numbers, like don‚Äôt clue many people catch diseases, couldn‚Äôt care less. People probably keep dying, obviously, enough problematic. point, life like 2019, clubs, parades, exc. probably end 2021s don‚Äôt think one repost though. first one, posts US‚Äô daily update BNO removed. Good virus, is

Edit: also think good means high colloquially Honestly. Mrs C prez we'd probably 50k deaths Trump would definitely win election. title Early vaccines MIGHTprevent symptoms

&amp;#x200B;

the real questions is; prevent mortality . sadly powered look vaccines prevent symptoms

ok cool that's fucking point actually Unlikely. Maybe gets 100,000 next Friday. Return normal happen cases community spread significantly reduced, simple. happens without vaccine: normal. vaccine comes out, don‚Äôt see huge drop: normal. Nobody wearing outside Sherman oaks neighborhood LA. stopped going walks unless it‚Äôs 5am Wow! need Ontario Canada. wait 5 days rest result. countries standards* would add first saying, ‚ÄúIf don‚Äôt get vaccine, don‚Äôt trust science you‚Äôre antivaxxer.‚Äù

I always remember people say won‚Äôt take vaccine Trump started saying things it. political views got way science strongly advocated for. 1.3 million tests well. Previous peak 700k tests July. terms actual numbers still pretty far April July. also tend live closer quarters less ability isolate. teach one areas *many* students live either multigenerational household apartment shared another family (or two). Many rely public transit laundry facilities, childcare often shared multiple families live near other, etc. Flu sticks around mutates fast. That's understanding. probably also, everyone vaccinates. guess both. Smart department! Props! able 10th Amendment Commerce Clause. cant interfere interstate commerce. pure comedy That's covid vaccine reduces mortality bad flu season enough end No, slam kill everyone. KNOW.....and knowing HALF BATTLE. Good luck half, handpuppet. Well truly remarkable managed it! Nebraskan here. ridiculous. frustrating bc work healthcare, we've using masks ppe since March, asked go unless strictly necessary (grocery shopping, etc). think lot problem is, heard happening regions, hit us long, people need use masks right away - really need to, still mentality ""Oh bad here."" Yeah, thanks attitude, we're 21% infection rate county, get tested twice week, go anywhere except home work. ? Australia getting bit heated ,maybe. country divided eight territories states various degrees strictness border controls .So eight islands within island .Some islands want open islands islands saying chance states tighter restrictions saying come ! certain media pushing buttons.

Has great strategy controlling covid 19 spread though.  Trump win get 4 years anyways guys ain't locking anytime soon oh irony. #triggered Always moving goal posts ... tsk tsk necessarily, could close number. way knowing Oh yeah, love country (sarcasm) people still use CFR? geez... locked early, might ok. seems late now, purely many people dgaf. locked 8n state early. Havent local case 6 months, back normal since June. Vegeta would proud. 91k rest what? PERSONAL LIBERTY, MUH AMENDMENTS

This bugs two kinds freedom: negative freedom positive freedom. Negative freedoms exist everyone third party acts upon *negate* them, things like freedom belief, freedom assembly, speech. positive freedoms require people working together create them; things like healthcare, money, gun rights, none single person alone.

It's insulting someone hollers rights freedom really mean ""I wanna."" infantile ignorant. ironic part *supporters* anti-politician. Yet, licking Trump‚Äôs shoes.

The fact anyone fanboy political leader quite sad imo. ...shutting high-risk ...shutting everything down...

One things like other... conservatives perfectly happy infect others personally OK. LOL, sad one though. effective way make someone play rules hit wallet. Wasn‚Äôt recent case SCOTUS overturned federal ban sports betting found coercive? Curious plays debate since recent precedent. You‚Äôre wrong, probably would have...if Ol‚Äôhotwheels Abbott would stepped allowed TX cities make policies fit situations. I‚Äôm Amarillo we‚Äôre boat El Pasi smaller population. local government says hands tied....proud El Paso did...even if, like said, done sooner. People still get flu even thought get flu shot. prevents symptoms actual infection... might feel sick.. others might still get quite ill wont bad get shot. make sense?  sad way get anybody's attention sue them. wonder people sued local health department, restaurants, airlines, NFL teams, colleges, etc., get better protection covid. never based argument on, stated-- ""Yelling 'fire' crowded movie theater ...illegal."" argument revolves around legal precedents ""limit free speech,"". citing commonly understood example free speech limited-- never reference particular case definately cherry picked example. clearly agree speech must limit, clarified speech incites ""imminent lawless action"" restricted. 


Yet instead arguing central point choose straw-man argument, thought would appear smart citing ""yelling fire ain't illegal unless .... incites imminent lawless action"". 

Way ignore central argument limits free speech, declare ""[The card says That's classic Alt-Right Playbook!

So, agree using free speech incite ""imminent lawless action"" illegal. Would free speech like telling someone wear legally mandated mask pandemic?



Imagine people getting trampled due someones speech incited 'imminent lawless action'. legal precedent free speech limits less applicable coronovirus situation someone could incite others, like infected person, unmasked, infecting others ""imminent lawless action"". guarantee, hackers always unlock. It‚Äôs business didn‚Äôt unlock, ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù would stop paying ransoms. Remember whitehouse task force came phases? 

I guess ignored them. Brought pollsters saying Biden winning. specify USA. places decided take action fine. Havent local case 6 months state back normal living since June. I'm confused. feel like recent months, sub moved :

\-There vaccine ever, we've never created one Coronavirus

\-I'm getting vaccine, rushed untrustworthy

\-Wait, wait DECEMBER? said September!!! Stfu fear gone, meaning compliance gone. election week away. lockdown would rock boat would cause anger only, people would actually listen already cautious/locked down. stimulus reaction happen election. Sounds like you‚Äôre worried something hasn‚Äôt even happened yet save lives allow economy come back

Clearly responding comment never opinion mask mandate.

Look, responded insinuated willing even entertain changing mind. attitude rubs wrong way think set ways one reasons divided. think everyone least make honest attempt understand opposing arguments many validity. everything black white. all. 1.) get doctors from? Considering government limits immigration laws. US alone many.

2.) long take build hospitals?

3.) wear masks? Socially distance? Everyone. opposite anything lockdown. proper PPE everyone? domestic production proper PPE every citizen started months ago? Yeup state's really want India take virus, restrictions. collapse US y‚Äôall. Get gun stay safe. next two months going see Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas New Years. least Europe, countries locking down. crush numbers month like happened April, chance get Christmas/New Year. looking bleak US. Numbers surging, US timeline month behind Europe. Unless state governments start announcing new restrictions, US Europe Thanksgiving, that's absolute worst time peak, health economic reasons. Exactly, party dislikes big corporations much, would think democratic jurisdictions would care little guy. look cases vs. deaths time region apparent getting much better treating virus and/or it‚Äôs becoming less deadly Majority Americans wanted Hilary Trump too. Seriously. vaccine endpoint. There‚Äôs nothing that. vaccine doesn‚Äôt need 100% effective make people immune order us revert back normal. vaccine prevents symptoms, lowers viral load, that‚Äôs good enough reduce deaths cases. 

No one living like years end vaccine won‚Äôt eradicate virus. Eradication never goal first place. want enforce mandate? lot bravado demanding unseen person forced mask up...

What penalty who? going tickets cops. maybe arrests cops. think masks worn? Maybe conservative areas? know wear masks? People backgrounds. Black ""democrat"" men wear masks... want empower police country, areas without mask mandates, get new law go confront guys?

The demand national mask mandate really either demand mask suggestion, demand police state enforcing laws targeted powerless...that ain't rich Karen's supermarket. love wearing masks, smh don‚Äôt, *NEVER* see National mask mandate US. stop red lights? limit freedom/sense choice too? Yes, people stay locked in. Good them, they‚Äôll make queues shorter. know. However, relevant law concerning covid masks, therefore coercion concerning masks. laws concerning alcohol, hence Feds ability coerce using element law (age). 

You can't coerce underlying legal means coerce, alcohol example. prospect virus come back around every year like influenza common cold depressing ponder. Melbourne? Kind like need president Democrat republican.

Education follows pattern. Government increases involvement new initiatives standards. Naturally, require bureaucracy administer measure. increases administrative costs encourages teaching measure via standardized tests. keep spending keep getting less.

I teacher friend stereotype holds true: earn much still bought things class. union tenure system keeps things stagnant, teachers can't move jobs freely they're encouraged spend literally whole working lives attached one school district, enticed tenure pension.

Things *naturally* broken. Nature shows us things thrive competitive pressure instead top-down rules, top-down government is. could go government screwed cost social/societal aspects higher education, long already.

Point is, people always ask do, largely we've *doing* that's problem. Therefore seems less (particularly federal level).

Aside willingness accept authoritarian rule, Americans kind none that. Yep, I‚Äôm agreeing Lol funny. get it, funny. They've got 2-3 weeks case acceleration already baked in, definitely going get worse. Ireland 43 ICU, 330 hospital, 866 new cases today. (4.8mil pop)

Northern Ireland 44 ICU, 361 hospital, 822 new cases today, positive rate 25% ( 822 cases / 3,283 individuals ).

Rolling cliff looks like turning corner.

Are making argument tripping well?

What said unintelligent, I'm trouble understanding dumb point trying make. funny could best scientists resources disposal yet fail utilise them. US classic example, probably best people deal event yet failed miserably poor leadership. Go New Zealand üá≥üáø Dude lot testing done there. party's illegal. head arse? article makes initial COVID-19 vaccines prevent symptoms become infected coronavirus rather kill virus itself,

Our vaccine trials directly testing see vaccines prevent spread, probably do. reduction viral load is, literally, way prevent spread.

Later vaccines going different earlier ones. lot candidates, maybe better sterilizing others, vaccine trials designed tell us scientists could focus developing solution would reach full goal preventing initial infection.

Scientists already pretty focused. ok end. Always willing listen arguments change mind. Sounds like become person fighting against. April going disappear like miracle warm weather. Maybe April? strategies wearing face masks, social distancing avoiding large crowds important preventing spread infection ‚Äúquite time,‚Äù Fauci public health measures going make easier quickly get want go, approaching form normality,‚Äù said. Well I'm infectious disease doctor epidemiologist opinion irrelevant starters president stop saying over, rounding corner things nature. Maybe portray serious depiction virus, would surprised many states mask mandates, social distancing regulations live life like nothing happening..

Edit: btw. Thanks well wishes everyone! Medical facilities using extreme precautions. fine. literally Philadelphia War Bonds parade pandemic write history books. absolutely agree. Yup. Hard believe still people don‚Äôt understand masks supposed work. trials designed verifying that, don‚Äôt think anything prevents vaccines sterilizing cheeky fuckers follow europe time, like allways human histroy Probably lot testing ability now. probably worse earlier year testing capabilities. yeah seems European countries tighten restrictions contain now. gatherings private homes degree confer intelligence.    Masks store maybe, still parties families aren‚Äôt wearing masks then. Check back us years United States.

I sure 2040 we'll control. runs little bit complicated though, fear enforce lockdown without public open lockdown ignored 'circuit breaker' ends useless, go back regular numbers open again.

There's much countries actually prevent spread public it, riots would super spreader event. Everything fine. fine. *rounding* turn, people. * 

*/s absurdly high. point. Chinese get every buck invested stomping outbreak reward 1000 bucks wont annihilared widespread NPI.

A lesson countries failed learn. Maybe move communist China want mask mandate. People even choice there. There's concept personal freedoms. government dictates live life. want? turn America China? gonna deprive civil liberties. That's second Amendment. police kill somebody whole country packs streets 3 months. want mandate. hate wearing damn things. 

But, wear it. And, continue wear Fauci says otherwise.  should. take myself, way going babysit selfish jerk following rules. Come on, hard. Pretty much every country managing well.

Wear mask. *Quality* masks important too. would take time write contracts, tool up, etc. reason US provide N-95 masks *everyone*? Lol yeah lets destroy constitution virus .0026 death rate worldwide. establishment controlling fear power masses. Get knees beg. 100k tomorrow

Wasnt Hillary supposed arrested recently? ü§£ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è believe studies show masks mitigate enough make significant difference, transmission, initial infectious dose virus get through? Nobody says masks perfect. They're not. make big difference spread big difference severity someone still get virus. well, problem last 5 years ruling party spent (or wasted) money (including printed ones) order get re-elected. many countries made savings preparing next unknown crisis, guys. though told people everything fine financial situation great. meantime inflation started going up, dramatically, yet. current public debt close limit defined constitution. since first lockdown (which imho great fast decision; well done one action!) cost lot huge citizens' resistance new lockdowns... also- money support action. moreover, public healthcare massively underfunded understaffed (at end EU rankings! per capita) even go month huge problem containing following outbreaks. also worth noting air quality winter terrible since cold majority heating installations outdated or/and using coal.

there easy wins government. even morons would difficult find good solution... fingers crossed though! best part, listen boring work meetings instead acting like I‚Äôm paying attention interested someone saying. Personally literally put anything body boy Anthony tells point soooo many better, faster solutions build hospitals hire doctors. bet don‚Äôt support ACA, too. Taxes also bad, right? Majority vote count America. last election proved that. China's total cases *in day*

So much ""free world"" Don‚Äôt even vote - it‚Äôs devils handiwork! Many people numb tired don‚Äôt know majority people even react number cases and/or deaths becomes truly overwhelming even communities. 

I understand frustration, need vigilant always aware  Administrators ruin everything: colleges, hospitals, entire music industry, etc. NYC amazing world class medical facilities expand makeshift units accommodate patient loads still went hell getting patients care need. It‚Äôs going away November 4th. /s Kaio-Ken times 10. would probably help calm ""But muh freedum!"" crowd little point mandatory masks, unlike mandatory pants, would temporary. months, people could go back washing hands coughing other's faces, virus would go away. couple months universal masks happen. Oxford one adenovirus. Moderna Pfizer not. Russian one also adenovirus.

You make adenovirus vaccines frankensteining Covid's spike protein onto deactivated adenovirus particles. Adenoviruses another species viruses cause respiratory illness.

The thing adenovirus vaccines work, adenovirus something body never seen before. Oxford vaccine guarantees using adenovirus found chimps. 

What think article saying Covid reinfections common, want vaccines reuse give out, say yearly, boost everyone's immune system. may possible adenovirus vaccines, second time get injected, body recognize kill virus particles without responding spike protein.  talked believe based spike protein remains constant understanding mutations different strain like flus H1N1 vs H5N2 hopefully. think ireland first they're levelling week lockdown ""Trump ended pandemic!"" -white house science dept hand, think lot people advocating thorough lockdown possible without caring second-order consequences strictly scared themselves, whether actually risk. way many conspiracy nuts there, also anxious people greatly exaggerating risks.

I live assumption people selfish. also become obvious year people care science suit emotional point view, people opinion pandemic March April would never change matter much evidence presented front them.

This true vaccines diseases going exposed particularly often, infections occuring en masse population every day. 

I believe true pandemics. body going regularly challenged virus absolutely everywhere (e.g. countries trials taking place, Brazil). antibody enhanced infections occur see relatively quickly, probably towards end phase 3 trials, majority vaccines deployed. 

I've read papers ADE vaccine tests occuring mice, occuring around half mice, relatively small number. Again, suggesting see quite soon.

If occur frequency &lt; 0.5%, would still beat getting actual covid, study found 78% people get covid (see links comment above: middle aged, healthy, light symptoms) getting measurable long-term heart damage, addition variously: neurological damage, immune system dysfunction/CFS type symptoms, lung damage, kidney damage death.

Let us forget possibility COVID-19 inducing ADE response - read believed one possible reason (alternative cytokine storm hypothesis) many young-to-middle-aged people died rapidly Spanish Flu 1918 second pass around globe, whereas first pass mostly typical flu victims (old, sick). schools still open. problem ICU beds SING IT, KIDS! ‚ÄúAll want Christmas five vaccines.‚Äù He‚Äôs probably going fine, might affect draft position.

Got downvoted hell suggested thing yesterday. yes- we‚Äôve watched rumors like turn objective truth since January. 

I‚Äôm saying reinfection absolutely happening wide scale. Im suggesting anything definitively. 

I‚Äôm saying that, like ‚Äúfew instances‚Äù neurological issues, strokes, cardiac problems, anecdotal rumors prior ended far common initially thought. since evidence absence- it‚Äôs question, even foolish thing ponder. Multiple reasons : 
1. Small businesses started suiing government going bankrupt due lockdown. government decided ease measures amount cases really low. 
Then re-opened schools people going back work. also allowed people travel and, end, government's guideline : ""Do want supid""... 
It started poping back around Antwerp orthodox jewish muslim communities people respect social distancing, wear masks on. spread flanders slowly Brussels Wallonia. 
We changed government 1 month ago. 
The federal government started taking half-assed measured regional politicians wanted justify salary needed seen camera decided take half-assed measures time. people became really confused could region like curfew 8PM Wallonia 10 PM Flanders... give exemple, live Flanders end street Brussels 10km away wallonia. talking huge distances like US here. Lol, mentioned government once. tens thousands nongovernment scientists doctors ability confirm reinfection. grand conspiracy? find absolutely incredible home office used wherever possible. Personally, would walk job. conversation along lines boss feb. happy ally.   People thinking straight. They're acting like hurricane something hit society collapse. What‚Äôs going happen schools? TEA going allow move virtual learning? wish way filter cases see everything else. way government beginning mean? Throwing science like that??? notebook still radioactive. Wow weird it‚Äôs like shouldn‚Äôt opened many countries saying since beginning. Remember flatten curve? folks could try reading article explained forced cough that's tested.

Crazy, context one commenting on. better 16 provinces China. government, people.

Korea shuts schools first rise cases...and compared Europe, amount cases freak low (it's like anything 100). point many European countries worse U.S.

Some big population centers US (NY, SF Bay Area, etc) decent job managing things right now, that's keeping overall country-wide numbers bit. 

That could change, course. LOL seem like real nice person Thereaputics help covid19 becoming endemic without major theraptics effective vaccine horrifying. Fast food essential via drive thru apparently. Ontario is/was, would assume USA considers fast food essential too. government support socialism socialism bad /s 


...even though reason child labour laws, 8 hour work-day etc early 20th century socialists... country recognises Taiwan country? Honestly? People reason less less empathy towards suffering Americans, despite worthy US citizens built country got loved one *unnecessarily* taken away.

Let sink in: vast majority 250'000+ deaths could avoided small amount common sense small amount competency.

If that's truly valuing, certain want it. Pretty much Southern European countries popular tourists Europe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Italy Spain extreme tourism...and Croatia gets honorary mention (I would curious scientists map many cases came given tourists behaving summer, I've heard). Envy world? Taiwan worst 16 provinces China. safe, friends great country. r/Coronavirus nutshell:

**Cases rise Europe:** ""Thoughts prayers""

**Cases rise US:** ""Lol"" cost prohibitive, like $100 million per hospital, probably way nyc. It‚Äôs ok, US keep printing money paying people pandemic. It‚Äôll cost trillions show better solution. Numbers way higher, enough testing country still developing. herd people supporting schools opened downvoting always shocks me.

So take person, middle hundred years pandemic, force person physically present room 20 people hours everyday something done remotely. Maybe even use public transportation.
If exposing students risk enough, also severe long lasting effects get covid, come back home put family members risk.
So must quite frightening stressful think might reason dad grandma get covid die forced go school.

But average redditor knows best. curious- matter? Honestly, find fiddling mask I'm talking, shifts around mouth opens, removing I'm alone work, uncomfortable nose.

But deal comfort issue wear mask wait take bus, go store, others lobby work. Even relatively long periods time.

No one running marathon here. put mask on, pick groceries, come home, take mask off. Paywall. 
Anyway: Oh wow, find movie? Yup, well similar thing happening within community, refuse go seeing people cheer so. true, hospitalizations deaths hiding? lol indentured servitude. Rapid tests accurate PCR tests likely create false negative results. Vote every [insert person‚Äôs obvious affiliation], everywhere, every time.

(It‚Äôs insane mods rage-delete political comments clear political issue.) really kept control summer? moved around lot summer travel (there new strain Spain apparently showing that). 

&amp;#x200B;

My theory people stay outside summer transmission much less likely happen. seeing patterns Northeast US. weather got chillier, schools opened, much easier spread around. 

&amp;#x200B;

At least area US, literally EVERYONE wears mask indoors lot people wear outdoors. Berlin, many assholes wearing employees. -\_- shocked spike here, surprised happen sooner. german pfizer vaccine seems one gonna get stock price pumped.

Please take current POTUS says population believes... simply true. 42% positivity rate peak

This kinda disingenuous statement though. spring people ""just getting tested"". Getting tested SUPER hard. I'd sick early Feb lingering cough pretty concerned. city MD like can't help gave city number call. bounced around finally spoke DR basically like test XYZ hospital there's chance Covid come bc infected chance getting infected *there* high.

The positivity rate may high, that's also bc people pretty sure getting tested. Everyone else avoiding medical centers possible.

We don‚Äôt blindly agree public health measures timelines put front us medical professionals focus maximizing lives saved virus - virus alone - without considering harms society, job.

Our path forward agreement public governing bodies. majority country decides open floodgates open floodgates. 

We don‚Äôt need solely follow public health advice. Yes, result years lost (vast majority 70), give living young. Yeah, article crap, Im actually basing opinion research cited fact insignificant percentage reinfections coming severe first infection population skewed toward elderly, line pre-print.

Given states constitutionally-forbidden enacting policy, United States must considered statistical entity itself‚Äîit reason federally-coordinated response (which yet see) imperative.

Consider Chicago IL-IN-MI-WI Combined Statistical Area, stretches Racine County, WI northwest, La Salle County, IL southwest, Porter County, southeast, southern-most reaches Berrien County, MI northeast. Around 10 million people live region extends throughout portions four different states.

If trying cite something else, please, cite it. Tell people evicted. need fucking reality check. Go walk.

Not everyone necessarily agrees lockdown mask mandates, least begrudgingly bare minimum.

But one sociopathic douchebag. Let‚Äôs let person bring rest us down. Looking like it‚Äôs going long winter vaccine save us, though. hang vaccine. Immunity totally fake tho. That‚Äôs America‚Äôs healthcare‚Äôs slogan.

And half million new cases globally second day row. twelve days ago crossed 400K mark first time. many strains there? Majority Americans want new president, one fucking brain. Please vote. Among many things covid times demonstrated, women fuckin' nuts men. Jesus letting happen, clear (in understanding things).

OSHA absent everything. taking guidance CDC.

It's pretty pathetic OSHA stepped this. getting downvoted, popular opinion here. 

But probably true. hope ok. Reinfection real thing hope recover well. think article fantastic friend pointed there‚Äôs pushback scientists: Obsolete less effective? There's much hardship nordic countries, beg differ. current vaccines development phase 3 able protect strain well? Exactly! Masks nose, chin, around neck, hanging ear pocket ""wearing masks!!"" 85% need say 50% actually ""masking"" much!! say masks working!!! Makes mad could squeeze grapes eyelids!!! one doesn‚Äôt get symptoms going unlikely die... reduced severity behind reduced lethality patients already hospitalized, would imply people less severe symptoms getting hospitalized. 

I think overall suggests better treatments making death rate go down. reduced viral load/severity would explain lower hospitalization rates overall. I'm skeptical younger people much likely infected, think good chance widely undertested early people mild symptoms rarely tested unless healthcare.  hit peak. come down. people die. IDGAF anymore. got infected later asymptomatic. I'm sorry, grandma now? Truth. That's fair. I've seen ton people surgical masks they've worn many times, mask shape own, rather fitted face. speaking frustration personal encounters; bad, apologize. trying diss anyone who's legitimately trying. part adenol vectors mean? vaccine making now? believe numbers Coronavirus coming Florida................ prefer working home putting old folks ICU. US gained 91K cases day, Europe gained 245K cases day.

The second wave Europe much worse could've thought. Why? factors hospitals rushing patients onto ventilators using steroids. WHO's initial recommendations killed lot people.

No. probably saved lot people recommendations best information time. Wait wait. It‚Äôs damn thing! 100 slaves 3/5ths get representation thats 60.
OR
100 slaves get 3/5ths voice each, still 60

Imagine arguing semantics this, Jesus Christ Sure buddy. fun cave. There's plenty states require negative test upon arrival, upon departure. know anywhere US requires negative test actually leaving I'm sure would managed way everything state run national plan Omg, that's *bad* bad. summer peak looks like minor bump. Marijuana illegal federally, yet legal many states. fuck could possible? 

The amount ignorance coming illegal. Christ. How's irrelevant? From, like, mikeamericanman [at] yourbank.1235467575435.com, completely legit. really, no. Let hear say matter. think masks help situation? masks useless? know I've read porous ""bandana"" things great, even layered cloth masks help I've read. offer evidence otherwise?

I agree cloth masks perfect, thats pony quality go out, although first masks homemade, hold manufactured masks arrived. Pfizer may sold doses part Operation Warp Speed take development money, unlike Moderna.

Anyway, nice day. still amazed size human population. located MI near MSU even cases still know one person personally infected COVID NY. rural Mi Chandra still know single case. Lily pads indeed. going enrage lot folks get downvoted core Earth like every time say something like this. needs shouted mountain tops:

People need start making risk/benefit analyses stop worrying people doing. homerun treatments vaccines had, end sight COVID. cannot carry living like forever. want stay home, so, leave others operate way alone. promise one going force anything want do. often people would almost definitely die get COVID.

Nobody almost definitely dies. Even sickest nursing homes seem around 50% mortality only. best analogy may COVID chance kill everything else next 1-2 years combined would.

Lockdowns essentially longer option. state individual thing. individual things vary nothing cluster-busting ""mini-shutdowns"" like New York hot spots(which state one lowest % positives country).

Governors afraid shut local non-essential businesses would royally screwed, especially sign federal aid sight. federal government actively saying give fuck.

It's rough, I'm thankful one states currently shit together everything went (NY). ""voivode"" refere here?

Vaccine trials measure viral load (testing every participant regularly RT-PCR basically already), cannot directly measure contagiousness. wrong wish COVID would, know, cleanse population bit? Well we‚Äôre hoping jabbed placebo get infected. closure mistake insignificant effect anyway

Yeah, scientific basis that. yes, gives us answer want, post r/coronavirus aliens. think people advocating lockdowns want people kill themselves. According bunch different studies/surveys it‚Äôs minimum around 85%, recently low 90s. I‚Äôm really sick ‚ÄúAmericans don‚Äôt wear masks‚Äù narrative. It‚Äôs garbage it‚Äôs lie.

to personal experience, found media, especially ones US (and funded certain sources) tends to:

\- make accusation (without concreate proof)

\- reference accusation everywhere

\- start new accusation saying something like ""often accused / controversial"" ""background""

&amp;#x200B;

eventually, need prove anything, media stack accusations accusations use ""proofs"" new accusations.

and fair, skill used China, also political arguments. deluded you, know China, also know society.

so argue anything China here, genuine suggestion: try identify skill information absorbs daily.  Correct .
But also think wrong try get spread hospital's capacity. That's seems track end sight. half hearted measures see US. focus measures minimize spread (targeted closures (bars, restaurants supported government money minimize economic impact), unified widespread mask mandate public, encouraging socially distancing without going extreme) without get ""big guns"" (widespread lockdown, closures). Germany Literally Wednesday swiss news stated nost likely vaccines everyone end 2021 this? Srsly supposed believe trust days?

Nobody holding accountable, nobody enforcing anything. result, hardly anyone wears masks, restaurants occupancy limits, local businesses never shut length time, anything like rearranging aisles, marking social distancing spaces, etc.. strictly voluntary, opted out. Absolutely nobody charge wants one accused taking away anybody's ""rights"". So, nothing happens.  sad part still lose-lose situation.

Man, I'm Texan I'm everything make people safe careful. I've gotten two arguments management work decisions back May emailed fire department staff taking precautions public.

My kids schooling home, we're going groceries.

I wish people need wouldn't. people out, every person without needing creating danger people out, hate selfishness it. Hilarious workable suggestion entire comments thread downvoted. Lots death point national news showing refrigerator trucks house bodies mass buried park. Honestly scenes NY months ago scared living shit point told boss would using vacation time gave us work home orders. It‚Äôs heartbreaking went briefly living understanding connection people communities couples death toll experienced it‚Äôs heart wrenching explains willing wear mask protect ""iTs DeAdLiEr fLu"" wanna know gonna get worse gets better. 

We closer vaccine every day. Pfizer Moderna likely year. 

We multiple drugs fight aide recovery. kept someone old unhealthy Trump Alice. 

Our deaths aren‚Äôt peak, cases are. death case ratio extrapolated April country would fire. 

Asymptomatic people hiding everywhere. ‚Äúcases‚Äù probably order magnitude higher. 

Reckless people obeying mandates likely already form immunity. 

What besides ‚Äúcases increase‚Äù screams terror? 31%? miss like 60% infected. wtf. +3.5%. theres enough manpower enough time day get everyone tested. hit capacity laboratories? Trump rich president Halloween weekend, followed immediately high turnout election. Protests guarantee election. Thanksgiving, black Friday brick mortar stores stocked absolutely stay open encourage shopper turnout. either Trump administration, lame duck Trump administration. Neither going help one might actively sabotage federal response effort make incoming Biden administration struggle. Christmas. 

I'm planning stock pantry weekend. wish everybody best got loved ones hold close. Like, distance, though. Yea probably lot people caught got lockdowns hardly tests. mean Election Day ? ones going allowed go vote? Wow. That‚Äôs grim. Firefighters looking one floor burning waiting floors fire deciding whether put fire out. One cautious think world going end.

Wide spread CoVID19 heavy toll hospitals infrastructure.

For 60% people get symptoms hits heavily sticks around while. Correct. Yeah healthcare try let people suffer start circling drain. That‚Äôs ‚Äúcomfort measures‚Äù ordered docs. done difficult conversations family members, basically telling situation hopeless patient likely recover.

If decided discontinue life support, nurses would likely start infusion something like morphine fentanyl they‚Äôd remove breathing tube. patient would whole thing. point may coherent enough recognize family member came say final goodbyes, part would pretty zonked eventually would stop breathing. never go trial never found guilty! bad like, leader sorts. One unify states. sort job government power!? /S


Then again, currently, suppose better person position making calls related virus... day two early would normal church groups Trunk Treating. new Let‚Äôs keep setting bar low. two clearly love care. feel way North Carolina governor implemented mask mandate sheriffs rural areas refusing enforce it? read article tried force turn adblocker I'm guessing they're hoping Thanksgiving peak force action, like shutdowns partial full, masks mandated *enforced* on. Thus stopping Christmas major issue.  First foremost, community care. going sound harsh, amount rules restrictions going help unless people make conscious consistent decision follow them. People across country severely underestimating risk/evidence community spread thinking extremely short term. terrible, feel becoming desensitized deaths. ambivalence direct result 6+ months pretty solid home isolation (I something small month completely lose it) combined watching people go lives like nothing changed. absolutely dumbfounding. can't even get mad anymore.

All said, I'm sorry community. Stay well. basically, Texans need Texans stand rights. don‚Äôt think known R0 really supports numbers, unlike first surge capturing ill now, all, perfect, tiny fraction fraction US China seeing early days. messaging 1 month [**2020-11-30 04:11:14 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-11-30%2004:11:14%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this OTHERS CLICKED send PM also reminded reduce spam.

Round corner enough go circles... Hell coincidence according doctor told this, lady hairdresser right got sick client come back China.

I mean, it‚Äôs possible got asymptomatic covid later, circumstantial evidence quite strong. organizers expect pull without getting caught? thousands anecdotal cases. even totally blow (which might good idea) still consider 3 4 ""confirmed cases"".  there's smoke... there's fire. hallows' eve Paxton corrupt asshole. get fucked anything says probably bad. think figure outdated. think ICU beds left...

Enjoy life! Oh look, state license plates popping CA again.  live El Paso, everyone wears mask here, required. study local news cited said going eat, going shopping going Mexico riskiest behaviors. mean, Juarez right here, mayor COVID twice now. poisoned Chinese make America look bad. soldier all. /s thing happening Ky. Every time Beshear tries make mandate help us, Attorney General takes court sue ""mah rights!"" shit show everywhere. People one political party believe system often understand people's point view. Generally best, terms taste, make dark humor plight life, history, poweful assholes. That's short list. want sick people go vote? ""if sick stay inside"" FIRST rule? ""Come everybody going streaking threw quad!"" Covid killed americans 9/11 even wars.

So flu heart disease cancer diabetes. That's average new case every 0.95 seconds.

Also, know deep shit BNO allocating several daily updates country. Someone else referred ""BNO Newsroom Index"", pretty high lately. makes complete sense do.

But people throw fit traced.

Never mind it‚Äôs decentralized kept short term.

Never mind cellphone, smart watch, credit card there‚Äôs road map govt grab pretty quick.

Never mind none y‚Äôall interesting. strange awful times. Stay safe, take care love, even don't.

Thanks that. Hopefully, words agree on.  Yes, used autocratic power save lives. Maybe millions lives. pretty amazing. 

The power U.S. Public Health, state Public Health departments diminished weakened could function. lot states good Public Health employees, given tools, personnel, power needed do. know others disagree, show hilarious Holy shit. ""Vaccine 1 year? Literally POISON!!!"" not. Especially OC. Deaths mostly essential workers working class neighborhoods Anaheim Santa Ana. OC one giant affluent county. greatly depends part california live El paso, east side, one park near two basketball courts jam packed since reopened parks hard shut down. started keeping park lights discourage people playing instead cops come break up, people still played dark. never guess pandemic looking park night. I've walked dog morning wasteland old water bottles trash morning big games. I've seen people come clean park. Garbage cans around park people can't bothered. infuriating dangerous.

I've seen +30 people packed closely around one courts. Shit dangerously stupid. conspiracy suspicious fishy reporting Florida. may true right percentages stay 5% next weeks smell bullshit. virus spreads places restrictions absent. obvious. Florida hitting 7-8k next weeks. fudging numbers. F  
How named prepared country pandemic? Fking Delusional. trying dishonor anyone. easier close borders time keep closed. I'm glad guys right things, unlike happened here. geography irrelevant. harder European countries, example. I'm saying good job, certainly saying US fsiled island. mean British? lol President 6 times so, join club. 

But honesty that‚Äôs we‚Äôre saying. wear mask grocery gas station eating drinking hanging crowded room that‚Äôs virus spreads. also goes home, kinds friends people it‚Äôs creating spreading events. think government helping rent/leases etc distance, also providing us testing tracing, mask mandates etc Well fictional friends OP could needs bullshit story now. small children. bothers much people went house! Halloween election.  Holy shit it‚Äôs 5 days   People saying that. denial big . Comments saying something bad china downvoted case theyre wrong. downvoting americans complaining china fun. Influenza antigen shift proteins. Sars-Cov-2 not. weird lie they? Wildfires ravage west coast literally nobody area east coast anything. see basically go ‚Äúdamn sucks‚Äù Water Force. Hilarious boiling frog kind situation.

If covid came guns blazing 1000 deaths day 1, reactions would different. - New cases: 23,921 

- Positivity rate: 31.1% (+3.5)

- hospital: 6,187 (+263) 

- ICU: 1,057 (+64) 

- New deaths: 138

(Belgium 11.5 million population, btw)

Belgium's current COVID hospitalizations also surpassed previous record high deadly Spring wave.

Belgium already lost 0.1% entire population Spring wave alone (one world's highest per capita death tolls). I'm sad see country suffer another horrible wave. even winter yet... actually increased ICU beds 35% past two weeks. super apparent scale. exactly. shelter-at-home order put place hospitals 100% patients need get transported elsewhere. fuck direct violation anything?! people coughing lungs dying. Fuck id√≠ot attorney general. abbott stand guy I‚Äôm worried ability vote Tuesday well. Poll workers skew elderly - many won‚Äôt show up? many voters stay home skip voting safe? I‚Äôm huge liberal imagine El Paso Republican AF, heart breaks knowing local/state/federal leaders let covid get control long Election Day risk.  criminal Texas Attorney General 

 even worse that. Usually JCAHO (Joint Commission) state runs inspections hospitals nursing homes. less given up. get inspected anymore. know we're code there's nothing it. pretty much make rules best right now. 

That said kinda like inspections usually focus trivial things. reuse masks wash nitrile gloves can't drink behind nurses station. Get bent JCAHO. Welcome Czech Republic.

Oh, wait 740,000 people claimed unemployment first time last week! Whoooo! Winning! light end tunnel oncoming train. Cases exist test /s Strategy comes straight top trunk treating? way.

VOTE,! kind impressive american exceptionalism holy shit dude important difference government can‚Äôt blanket close businesses law. need list them, one one. intentionally done way, think, make sure cannot used unduly interfere basic freedoms constitution. üòà still unlikely young people die it.

We 2 confirmed 20 years old die Germany, 85% 70 years old.  get cases Friday? know based excess deaths.   
US deaths likely 300,000.   
Not really secret. good Ol cases tactic still gettin done globally. lock tomorrow get 1000 people fly plane. couldnt states shit together like month 2. Look shitfest we're now. SoCal (Los Angeles) definitely people wearing masks enter businesses here. Even runs/hikes trails, majority people wearing them. Wtf god rod? Pretty sure it‚Äôs one party holding back stimulus. follow US excess deaths, 300k +- excess deaths far year using Australia monitor. 

Great early indicator.  people seriously think lockdowns sort collective cure. bizarre. think different demographic people hit point. None good news though. Look Florida, states people care Please, im done tabarnak ~30% positivity rate right? lost three zeros. 10 **billion** RUB 126.79 **million** USD current rate 78.8699 RUB per 1 USD. long take get results back?
I hope identify hot spots make sure people isolate. Germany highest amount hospital beds per capita Europe. translates less pressure hospitals even relative amount covid cases.

So Germany necessarily handle current pandemic better better prepared large scale medical crisis general. Fuck workplaces. Yesterday, read article nursing home claiming unable get PPE. sell disposable gloves, masks, gowns Amazon. workplaces lie give shit employees. really think compassionate people gave site long time ago, never bothered first place. Sneering cynicism reigns supreme. really, would lot less deaths US, virus would still around. Europe heading back towards lockdown well. Florida Dude never harassed big city homeless people? can‚Äôt fix problems, I‚Äôm fucking broke well. issue. know honest idea anyone talking here. know read. guess people going restaurants (again). deadly pandemic, global health crisis. Thousands lives lost daily. important sitting Brenda drink work? People selfish dumb fuck. distribution approval always gonna problem fact good news

if Pfizer send amount end year even mid-January, even two doses per person that's 20 million high risk individuals getting arm jabs. that's gonna make sizeable dent fatality rate. great see positive news . Well done! Number one BESIDES masks social distancing. two obvious well known things. Ffs everyone thinks theyre clever, smart asses, reality everyone thinks youre dumb dick.  many people died far year compare average for, say, preceding 5 years? Ok think headline caused say long live California? think he'll immediately pack ?  healthcare system overwhelmed restrictions ""worked""

Which entire point restrictions first place. deaths nursing home fact 
\- administration removed health care system decades ago, there's lack medical competence within them.

\- They've privatized/defunded number years, leading low wages hourly employees, means take sick day they're getting payed.

etc.

Couple fact Stockholm densely populated capitol regions rest Nordics, different start far cases beginning.

Funny Sweden seen failure, example Belgium isn't. Since strict lockdowns, death rate fluke, right? big government! Except makes us look stupid. Dude state (Vic Aus) million people locked 700 cases/day - running double per million, whole state already locked down. 

I think late anyway given non-compliance governmental bullshit going though :( there's like less 2% chance stage three candidates fail, especially Pfizer trials kids teens

but anyway 2020 destroyed mentally already, fails make new different plans move life. shitting people hope gonna get far right now. Joe Rogan outraged. live ? Homelessness huge problem here. everyone commits together, get back ""normal"" sooner.

how make sense? virus disappear forever 100% lockdown. Fortunately, aunt outvoted 4 1 margin cases. 


And state trending much bluer people realize. fooled. Lol. Yes, t's authoritarian President change constitution president life. much blatant need be? one check make sure real number people want talk health department. going work US unless use app get building gets scanned Weird - 
American here. We‚Äôve playing contact sports. Pubs restaurants open. idiots think life pretty much normal. forget little covid bubble. Wish us luck. AG literal criminal. Indicted corruption 7 deputies band together formally publicly document much criminal is. 

And somehow he‚Äôs allowed make decisions put peoples lives directly risk? Insanity. country beyond broken  Aw shit, go asked evidence notable scientists germany whoa dvise school openings. 
You would probably able give ton evidence epidemiologists advise say side hard science, right?

To knowledge none. happy everything going schools (the finer details measures inside schools themselves), consensus opening schools absolutely acceptable (or rather keeping open).

What personally think psychology matter here. Pediatrists agree step led negative effects children. talking psychologists, talking doctors less likely get infected corona probably less infectuous, too. something denied before, true.
It obvious sneeze cough (because symptomless) infect less people (asymptomatic patients infect others, less likely so, least RKI thinks so).

There simply good excuse send school. risk minimal, risk parents small.
The risk however children negatively impacted staying home real documented.

You child favor try create panic warranted science.

The chance child negative lasting consequences schoolopening near zero. point, might aswell never let child leave house due car crashes crime. think even customers left phone numbers, could useful. seems like governors want people die. Mitch McConnell adjourned Congress election. words, stimulus happening. stock market dropping again, don‚Äôt seem even care enough give businesses hand Sounds like NYC Ask families +7,000 died yesterday. they? see empty houses area immediately bought. Rounding corner texan, works industry.... fuck? saw hours cut 60 hours week 25 beginning covid, went togo only. got one little shitty 1400 check make it. don‚Äôt get bed amount normal pay period. probably going go back that, governor lt gov couple fucking cock sucking assholes. Hey, guy plans living again!!! Let‚Äôs downvote him! course fucking Abbott tries overturn stay home order. El Paso needs wait broom closets parking lots hospitals full dead people, Abbott anything. CCP 90 million members. authoritarian? Research says antibody decays short period time mild syndrome. states CoV-vaccine maybe wilder immune response, people possibly get re-infected taking vaccine(not likely). take time develop it. 

Probably hard contain CoV sole vaccine(even effective) Yeah.

Sigh........... Polish government competent whipping hatred gays consolidating judicial power. Hard say yet whether they're competent dealing covid. Like eastern/central europe experience big first wave spring. leaving Paris?

France going insane  likely $3000 without insurance though, that's given. Well, cases/day barely increased September. started seeing huge uptick earlier month. people argued deaths/day track cases/day Summer wave, yet increased \~700/day 1500/day end. Maybe daily case number telling big picture, undoubtedly see deaths/day rise coming weeks months. even...wait it...Nazis.

Apparently choosing stay home avoid people comparable group people went way round people jewish people kill well tried invade nations world domination. Confirmation Bias. People ignore doesnt confirm beliefs. Dude recovered horrible first innnings.

The conservative press eviscerated him. 

Tough job have! tl;dr: Correlation =/= Causation point? binary situation. get infected don‚Äôt get infected.

You put 8 people non-ventilated meeting room 4 hours wearing masks infected. Period. vaccines target spike protein, focus receptor binding domain, mutates quite slowly. Definitely much flu, odds side. keep spreading hundreds thousands people, unwanted scenarios happen. Yeah misleading best disinfo worst way presented, two reasons: population presentation style. US 9x population Canada. map shows cases county level US province level Canada. 3000+ counties US 10 provinces Canada, US data shown much granular spread instead 50 big globs center points state, makes look like big sea red otherwise wouldn't. course still much worse Canada (about 3x bad recent weeks) disparately map would suggest. example Montana 25% cases Alberta, map Montana covered 5x much red Alberta, more. yeah yeah jesus ain't real get it, ugh won't. We're nation inbreds . . . nothing, point example USA *not* considered unitary outbreak quite literally not.

And lmao ""figures post sub normal democrats, telling normal democrats picked Biden Bernie"" 

Again, *you're making point* Lmao universe? whole 'Bernie would centrist Europe' stuff absolute bollocks, he'd far left like Jeremy Corbyn. sorry still live therw Lmao UBI probably help bro

 got UBI corporations, UBI farms, UBI oil companies, UBI military, lets try UBI people Valuable information July phase 3 data multiple vaccines. interesting theory bring almost year pandemic reason everything's pear shaped US Europe we're free. wonder nobody told us Yes, percentage requiring hospitalization dropping? That‚Äôs what‚Äôs important.  could shut civilians allow supply trucks through. Wearing masks important. mean, make immune disease obviously helps control spread disease certain places. Reports shown significant decrease number COVID cases states mask mandates, news, strengthens fact masks really essential. 

I get it, masks really uncomfortable wear way better tube shoved throat. stores brands sell breathable masks like ones Uniqlo Puraka Masks. cloth masks suit you, always stick disposable ones, though preferred choice adds pollution issues. always options go comes mask wearing, let's stop making excuses stay safe.  think biggest difference past certain regions states seeing increases pretty much everywhere getting hit time like federal immigration laws, right? six months ago?? majority logic hear China hiding numbers fact US couldn‚Äôt possibly bad compared China. It‚Äôs pathetic. Sounds like valuable information me. Yes, COVID situation got worse US currently experiencing. still they're nightly protests. away... we... gooo Dead moron: Jesus, could let happen me?

Jesus: sent reporters, scientists doctors warn months ahead time ignored them. WTF, man, pizza beer crowded restaurant spite warnings???   make illegal, wont happen. kids snack lunch breaks school wearing masks infecting friends family home? Yea dealing school outbreaks school refuses close notify parents. strongly advocate science, I'm also well aware Trump Administration least TRIED interfere rigorous development schedule push vaccine released prematurely. far appears they've rebuffed industry whole, I'm wary months ago. I'm willing get vaccine then, I'm also aware may take awhile rollout neck woods. I'm prepared wait months, year, get turn. Thank God. Bruh majority Americans agree something still doesn‚Äôt happen ???

See also: last election assholes case? know groups are.. cant make inferences natural behavior vaccine natural infections. They're also challenge trials young healthy people, means make inferences vaccine works young healthy people. someday, (if) actually grow you‚Äôre going feel stupid (rightfully so) naive. lol. Let's say I'm ICU need put ventilator look good.

What process? 

Do basically get sedated unconsciousness that's last thing ever know? came UK that's 35% surge ICU beds past two weeks.

I able find solid numbers normal occupancy ICUs, believe tend operate closer 80% occupied general hospital beds near 60%. really leave lot wiggle room large numbers people require urgent medical care. Long after. info off. suggest deeper research. Warp Speed vaccine.

Moderna received significant development funds produced risk government. Moderna produced nothing, investors backstoppped. Pfizer developed risk, without government backstop, sold 600m doses option. Pfizer vaccine work, take $1.5b loss without backstop. risk production also Pfizer. 

If moderna investor, can't lose here. Pfizer investor, can. grief. determination, anger virus determination kick ass? pulling together minimize economic displacement joy common goals? Yeah back mattered almost year ago  Lol National mandate constitutional, people want irrelevant. something called 10th amendment

""The powers delegated United States Constitution, prohibited States, reserved States respectively, people"" Look, I'm sorry, bananas going soft counter. honestly sounds weird me. American friends living China. going bars, concerts, etc... 

They suffering way are. Bubble suit. Cold flu season. Lol Exactly feel. wear cloth one every day work. (I work casino). let us wear N95 one want allow available medical workers. agree fuck wearing cloth ones scares me. Especially 1/4th shops/restaurants shut down.  spitballing here, think one main differences natural disasters vs covid devastation natural disaster much tangible visually. clearly see destroyed buildings, fallen trees, flipped cars, etc natural disaster. covid really equivalents that.   dealing it. People already going back normal. us dealing it. extended state emergency, re-imposed lockdowns worst hit territories, re-imposed national mask mandate (even outdoors), banned large gatherings, shut bars/gyms/etc purchased massive amount flu shots rapidly distribute help prevent compounding issue seasonal illnesses.

Not exactly back regular life. Good one. would need nothing approach lockdowns? 

There many options available keep R number masks, physical distancing, WFH possible, limiting numbers people social gatherings, hand sanitising everywhere.

America wants to. real propaganda cloth masks. Healthcare workers like dont believe teach medicine living. saying ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è like wearing condom hole poked it. mention, goes much longer going see spike COPD, rather Carbon dioxide dependance result complications sort o2 therapy. stuff talking heads dont tell you. Again, saying. probably dont care say anyways continue spout nonsense sellouts like Fauci spout. It‚Äôs heaven I‚Äôm still sure I‚Äôm introvert antisocial. days feels like both. I‚Äôm getting fed people following guidelines. got coronavirus one friends party last week. lied said didn‚Äôt did. Remember, Republicans believe local control. Upper respiratory viruses around since first human born several hundred thousand years ago. Woven textiles around 100,000 years. yet, none brilliant scientists ever discovered one stop other...until April year. Atomic weapons, supersonic jets, several men moon took place Magic Mask‚Ñ¢ discovered. coincidence! mean WH Science Dept. headed ‚Äúdear leaders‚Äù daughter Ivanka? Makes total sense. getting downvoted sub rife batshit crazy people, wrong.

It totally stands reason long lines crowds associated early voting could contributing rise infection rates. let nutjobs around deter speaking mind bringing valuable information table. like immigration laws, right? feel like American thing one could do. self involved may never really wondered people outside continental US deniers precovid hermits. Science political. Oh. Well work el paso beat virus!!!! It'll go away like miracle. grow up. Margo still shutdown. County Judge one issued order. another year two we'll finding permanent damage rate is. murder theft legal? going logic would point general curve rising slowly previous surges, think take unmitigated growth time get there. Without infection control measures change course would guess sometime around Thanksgiving personally. mean we‚Äôd done months ago we‚Äôd better off. People selfish country, I‚Äôm fucking hope go away anytime soon. failure dominate. meanwhile, can't think last time went saw someone wearing mask. every person every store wears one, biggest deviation people wearing noses.

the taxes suck NY I'm definitely feeling like small price pay pandemic. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner Trump administration, said previous Covid-19 surges, transmission rates really started come Americans hard-hit regions started ‚Äúexpress caution‚Äù going less wear face masks think it‚Äôs going take infection get there, think Thanksgiving, that‚Äôs going turning point infection levels get high enough many parts country start see policy reaction also consumer behavior start change. month December really spent probably hunkering bit more, hopefully turn corner get new year.‚Äù No... thats I'm saying,but people good luck telling vaccinated people social distance  Education uniform across nation property taxes funding schools. next towns east El Paso tiny, 100 people so. next city beyond 10 minutes away. Perhaps type people get flu shots wear masks taking lower viral load get sick? Correlation equal causation, kids. using domestic media article (one significant domestic media sources) claim media saying enough people wearing masks. I'm sociopath thinking calling anyone without mask murderer ridiculous? Yeah, okay, buddy. Maybe try get fresh air. cooped inside 8 months clearly taking toll. folks see disdain flag fact means nothing nowadays uphold people's American values, call *us* least patriotic. 


I think that's projection bit  think federal response set tone colored entire Covid response. masterclass leadership (or lack thereof) defines nation react events? football season. Honestly, surprised?  Glad it.  think that‚Äôs vaccines get approved. Probably won‚Äôt well space bugs can‚Äôt take precautions I'd wager election propaganda seen week two though. fucking skull think people continue social distance summer time. Especially, US wise. Hi work childcare kids really taking issue it. one kept pulling asked understood going on. said explained seen intentionally unmasked week. 


Kids really issue old enough get politics. maroon! don‚Äôt conservative. give us hope. statements could true. ‚ÄúMany months‚Äù != lifelong Fucking loser. Yes I‚Äôve flu. knocks days feel better.

That sounds like cold me, flu basically incoherent week able tell day was; next week energy levels low unable basic care without needing rest.

All probably took month fully back normal. wonder type people join covid trial type people taking lot precautions? they‚Äôre less likely get infected? anyone signing dangerous plans held responsible.

It absolutely insane people making decisions getting thousands killed people like scramble defend actions technically legal.

No wonder government left us die attitudes like yours. Wait. thought Americans thought virus would end election. miss? yes voting Election Day? live dictatorship capital, man. 1000 dead Americans day. It‚Äôs crime. don‚Äôt need here. indeed rough underprivileged kids. rough losing family member, teacher, etc. hard choices, ultimately, year education lost costly life. passed 91k new cases today Argentina Sweden left wing governments right who? guide bad things get, look across Atlantic now. Belgium getting 15,000+ cases day 11 million people. France getting 50,000 cases day 67 million. multiply France's cases ratio populations, like US getting 250,000 new cases day. US yet reach 100,000. Things get lot worse hitting peak. count US leaders half country much things get least France's level ""bad"". Jesus. looks haven‚Äôt even reported negative test results last 5 days feeee-males cautionary tale? Obvious troll obvious investigation team determined first detected case 2 generations local patient zero. keep hopes could find exact route transmission. Call ask phone precautions are. Whenever make appointments now, it‚Äôs second nature ask don‚Äôt worry later. Fwiw, I‚Äôm also socal dentist set lot safety precautions hopefully same! Sleep tight. Honest question, compare deaths flu fevers? Well, that's three months. Could antibodies already gone. Quick question: Wisconsin mask mandate 2.5 months. last weeks seen surge hospital cases due covid. masks one biggest tools help stop covid spreading, gives WI? saying ‚Äúwell um people arent wearing masks even tho r supposed to‚Äù isnt acceptable response unless u prove it. brescia 380 today. bergamo seems hang on. so.. dunno. herd immunity, real point run risk collapsing sanitary system. march, simple point Grrrr! Nothing infuriating sheeple comment wearing mask-well... maybe wearing masks noses, pulling speak infuriating, much. Stay safe! know feel. things legal precedent government doesn‚Äôt exactly stay reined stuff like don‚Äôt hope faces long-term consequences, kinda hope faces long-term consequences hell playing football year?! 

I get shouldn‚Äôt wish anyone, inability many people take seriously maddening. Hello, tested positive antibodies back May, tested negative another past week. doctor said normal worry, I‚Äôm still little concerned getting sick though. I‚Äôve asymptotic, essential worker. Thanks! virus reach effect affluent neighborhoods. People care. government care. operated way since country formed. would anyone think different now?

Tldr: Nothing major done US affluent people start dropping. things work America. ok we‚Äôve reached stage. i‚Äôm bored. thanks playing. good night. People generally intubated emergency, transferred ICU later hooked ventilator. intubation process involve sedation. staff busy trying save life worry feel. get tube shoved throat may may conscious point - patients look unconscious point, people say remember it. also ""restriction"" aimed ""for good"", yanking child way speeding car stopping walking cliff good. 

Problem is, line reasoning absolutely used bad purposes, extremes people take is... Well hate using word stupid, stupid. don‚Äôt recommend change clinical practice. need hospitals Russia last spring, mile-long lines ambulances waiting someone die could drop patient go pick someone mass graves covid victims New York City's Hart Island many people died city morgues filled up, refrigerated trucks full, funeral homes area ran room. trench sixty coffins long, two coffins wide, three coffins deep. covid trenches nearby. unknowable percentage people died New York's hospitals overwhelmed.

El Paso medical sevices deepest sympathy support; governor Texas collective maskholes utmost contempt. fucked *91k
Smashing records like never before! think people still going vote polls remain open, hopefully won‚Äôt impact. countries swung hard right late though Probably point laugh them. sad country half morons Sadly thing he‚Äôs probably getting $200K hospital bill.

Hey look kids, there's Big Ben, there's Parliament we're gonna localized shutdowns get 100k/day rolling average, i'm guessing guess what? coronavirus doesnt give shit youre grocery store. grocery stores become fucking disneyland shutdown like leave open. massive superspreader environment. it. just. doesnt. work. either shutdown everything dont. Except know people who've died COVID.

Checkmate, actual cabbage. agree that. People fairly hopeless. Pot, meet kettle. 2 kids 7 5 great masks. younger ones agree issue, pretty good taking direction keeping on.

The real issue yes agree parents tell kids need mask. get high school middle school hormones, amount telling stops that's reality. also sports age close proximity.  Ooh! got 'em! Nice work kid Frontline Doctors

lol 21:37, nice 60% would follow sad. 35%? Please. rookie numbers. Wyoming hit 55% positivity rate today. Dying thousands ""dealing it""?

Interesting definition there. others pointed out, including article, may places progressive evidenced electing female leaders. Progressives likely take preventative measures listen experts. Suburbs exist lol plenty evidence going herd immunity lead millions dead US alone. sort sociopath advocate that. Got tested early October. super easy like hundred different times pick from. Miggt dofferent Gothenburg, super easy Stockholm suburbs. Worldometers posted 91k Another issue people expect mask 100% effective.  can't understand hand washing, social distancing, etc. help reduce spread, eliminate it. too. makes head spin. need rollback wind completely shutdown again. Trump federal government need truly act. Now. Close hotspots across board, close schools Spring 2021, start mask mandate, bulk contact tracing, start ad campaigns raise awareness. Pass stimulus package. Make sure every place needs PPE need hand.

If can't fucked.

25% people immune disease reduce Rt 25%
 
some restriction mask wearing reduce Rt
 
summer probably big help too..
 
that said variable changed colder months came Rt higher 1, quite possible antibody levels waned..

I'm confused.


Why sub saying opposite white house saying? Questions:

1. current treatments considered effective COVID positive patients ICU?

2. ventilators used less sickest COVID positive patients, since might help/might actually harmful sickest patients? vIrUs cAnT CoNTRoLlEd going become endemic Trump still wrong thought White House ended pandemic already? go away like miracle

But public discourse , juat dont think particularly helpful assume worst people think things do.

For instance, masks 100% effective. help. 

So side mask debate example, could assume worst (perhaps strawman you) saying proposal wearing masks stupid work. gets us nowhere.

I might woods time next year, bother much still symptoms like time next year, consider lucky indeed (first) COVID experience, yes, *very* smart want get infected COVID.

EDIT: Oh yeah, also think balance issues now. think part people likely use sub like hyper focused virus likely afraid it.

Meanwhile millions others stopped following covid news months ago largely returned normal life. number one üá∫üá≤ fine. ask question? expect people obey serve? me, would get bouts extreme anxiety restlessness.

It absolutely make sense. normally go months without seeing another person wouldn‚Äôt bother me, week shutdown, running walls.

In fact, shutdown first started, felt much less anxious absence ambient sound road noise morning afternoon rush hours.

I think something option go out. Canada next door US could done something But, case, could also presumably still spread infection. 

I cannot imagine fun games trying get much U.S. population understand accept - even they're vaccinated - need continue social distancing mask use high enough proportion population vaccinated (or infection).

My fear (and expectation) that, soon vaccine approved US, many, many people declare pandemic over. Compliance mask social distancing rules evaporate case numbers, hospitalization deaths spike several months - enough people enough immunity return something closer normal. Halloween eve eve. accurate assessment scene, think. sadness eyes something struck well. Great documentary, seen yet. that. Related, I've necessary repairs done apartment literally contractors tried come home without mask. live mask-mandate state 95% people wearing everywhere. like biggest ""fuck you""  FFS. really what? 8,9 months since virus hit everyone going apeshit this. even gone entire cycle holidays yet.

Give six months. Vaccines process, experts saying mid end next year thing well control. Stop talking 5, 10 years. We're barely past 5, 10 months. He‚Äôs done Clemson.  
Edit: mean year. can‚Äôt practice next week ACC rule may even suit Notre Dame Nobody Trump (or people orbit) ever saying September.

Nov/Dec always timeframe approval, hopefulness could start rolling front line health care workers end year.

Jan/Feb/Mar always timeframe likely high risk people would able get it.

Apr/May/Jun optimistic timeline general public, pessimistic estimates dragging another 3-6 months.

And recall getting downvoted hell pointing Trump saying ""we'd vaccine year"" likely technically correct (although correct way implying omission everyone would able get it). 1,000 deaths / day? 
How compare Benghazi Bowling Green? /s don‚Äôt wish anybody die. could 0 covid deaths obviously would. However, covid deaths double/single digits daily, hard time thinking society keep living like this.

death rates go (until given hospital overwhelmed) better treatment Even true cov2 infectious flu ( estimated R0 3-6) kill continue kill people per year flu. still nasty disease. Since people likely get infected people die.

## Abstract

**Objective** assess risk hospital admission coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) among patient facing non-patient facing healthcare workers household members.

**Design** Nationwide linkage cohort study.

**Setting** Scotland, UK, 1 March 6 June 2020.

**Participants** Healthcare workers aged 18-65 years, households, members general population.

**Main outcome measure** Admission hospital covid-19.

**Results** cohort comprised 158‚Äâ445 healthcare workers, (90‚Äâ733; 57.3%) patient facing, 229‚Äâ905 household members. hospital admissions covid-19 working age population (18-65 year olds), 17.2% (360/2097) healthcare workers households. adjustment age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, comorbidity, risk admission due covid-19 non-patient facing healthcare workers households similar risk general population (hazard ratio 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.52 1.26) 0.86 (0.49 1.51), respectively). models adjusting covariates, however, patient facing healthcare workers, compared non-patient facing healthcare workers, higher risk (hazard ratio 3.30, 2.13 5.13), household members patient facing healthcare workers (1.79, 1.10 2.91). sub-division patient facing healthcare workers worked ‚Äúfront door,‚Äù intensive care, non-intensive care aerosol generating settings other, front door roles higher risk (hazard ratio 2.09, 1.49 2.94). patient facing healthcare workers households, estimated absolute risk hospital admission covid-19 less 0.5%, 1% older men comorbidity.

**Conclusions** Healthcare workers households contributed sixth covid-19 cases admitted hospital. Although absolute risk admission low overall, patient facing healthcare workers household members threefold twofold increased risks admission covid-19. course not. rich powerful will.

'Twas ever thus. caseload death rate far lower covid. 60 million Americans infected 12,500 died course year.

The reason influenza spent hundreds years humans. virus evolved less lethal immune system evolved fight better. 

Covid, hand coronavirus, 7 strains ever infected humans. immune systems bad fighting coronaviruses; vaccine SARS lasts couple years able get vaccine MERS stick. Luckily, two severe enough kill hosts faster spread new ones.

The 4 Coronaviruses seasonal colds. difference is, though, keep getting flu mutates easily, keep getting 4 coronaviruses body loses immunity handful years. well adapted fighting form virus.

That necessarily mean vaccine impossible Covid-19, though. One, virus lot serious seasonal ones, help immune system pay attention. Two, much reason find vaccine Covid SARS MERS, burn quickly massive pandemics.

And three, even years immunity could enough either take boosters regular intervals organize real international effort eradicate globally. ...

I would like think nobody legitimately believes zombies real thing. still believe could go ask thousand random people one would claim zombies real. sarcasm got lot bad news share think people keep sacrifice another whole year, OOF. really uninformed take, brah Worst week... far I'll let know errs

1. article cited declining antibodies justification saying people becoming immune. widely understood body's calls B cells responsible mounting defense creating antibodies, number particular antibody decline time needed reinfection.

2. title states herd immunity ""a long time away"". title vague respect hard dispute vague information, whole reason article titles like vague first place. However, UK infection rate 23,000 cases per day, 690,000 cases per month. likely rise near future. Regardless, 690,000 new cases per month **over 10% population per month.** new cases addition people already infected (between 5% 10% population) UK expect least 30% population infected New Years, least 60% Spring. remember, infection rates go holidays. unreasonable expect herd immunity achieved winter. 

Is winter long way off? next Spring log way off? 10 year old. I'm child, next Spring long way off. it‚Äôs fall winter. governor authority forbid mayoral orders. would imagine large city republican AF? Thank you, best luck too! reporting hospitalization rates higher right now, account testing issues. 

if guessing i'd say approaching first peak, can't cite good reason saying that. Cool Tell Politics subreddit. states, Idaho‚Äôs top two state executives run joint ticket, Little competed campaigned separately. pandemic hit spring, quickly began clash whether shut businesses public May, Idaho Statesman reported, longer speaking directly. Little ordered bars stay closed mid-June, McGeachin defied directive reopened family‚Äôs Idaho Falls tavern weeks order lifted.

Yikes.  Ok think two doses, logistics make happen??? Duh many. way process need tested within 72 hours arrival, nature beast testing poor US need begin trip receive results meet time frames required.

If trip 16 hours Hawaii, gives 2 days tested receiving results. That's possible cases currently US remember correctly, yes. anyone wondering, local news sources reporting shutdown applies bars, restaurants person dining, tattoo parlors, nail hair salons, massage therapy places, gyms. I've seen list KTSM news station local paper, mention polling sites remain open. look live - Czechia. worst infection rates entire world right still really full lockdown here, even though government calling it. decided institute ""lockdown"" one day claiming definitely institute lockdown October. 

And current level mobility accounting current restrictions see total collapse hospitals (which already refusing non-covid patients capacity) possibly within two weeks expect 9,000 - 15,000 dead end year. Mind you, &lt;700 deaths October 1st. link study? Yup people still dumb makes sick is, Christian, many people see Christianity. 

Jesus told followers ‚Äúgo make disciples‚Äù. sickness pushes people away. don‚Äôt get it. Yes, know numbers bigger Florida official counts DeSantis fuck. People tired hearing this, according Trump, it‚Äôs big deal anymore people tired /s bat shit crazy ""the guy""? US testing levels though difficult, since would imply 8x current positive reate Followed biggest State Fair possibly do. virus's strength comes attacking immune system normal evolutional pressures, guess. people won‚Äôt care it‚Äôs 200k 300k day. Honestly death toll could rocket million people won‚Äôt care. local cinemas already opened. I'm supposed go Vegas next May probably see live show. Cool, virus hoax, please stop transporting crisis actor patients across states lines. 

They taking medical resources states actually listen science take thing seriously. Fucking morons. doesn't, early next week would likely due weekend data issues legal government tell citizen need pay another citizen services providing, without subsidizing payments?

Because CDC actually massive powers respond cold war-era germ warfare scenarios never used. religion want know. Get life tool.
Double far want comment whatever want make feel better. I've already blocked you. Saw story yesterday said Florida's numbers magically changed right Trump administration complained high number cases. DeSantis, anything possible. reality situation is:

Infect morons realise Corona virus real thing hoax

Bonus feature 

They need support socialised healthcare 

I'm saying good idea, however one fits..... crossing 100K days ...

what cluster fucking fuck change politics  Thanks mate! people 100% dead serious say shit like post. really stupid person joke becoming zombie everytime anything comes vaccines treatments. pretty shitty tired joke.

How go post article Canada USA boarder closed Canada build wall make USA pay it.

Get new material. Except government can‚Äôt legally that. stating grab things ‚Äúquickly‚Äù disingenuous approval process one hurdle. second hurdle get people take vaccine even widely available...that potential drag uptake vaccine drawn process 2021 get sort ""herd immunity"" Yeah used live NW side North. Frequently that‚Äôs anecdotal experience based on. 

Yeah go visit parents DuPage it‚Äôs different sure, depends town though. Wheaton awful lol. Yeah, like France Spain?! even deal anymore lockdowns. government extremely hypocritical requiring landlords keep paying property taxes tenants can't evicted.

On hand, imagine chaos incumbent's reelection mass evictions taking place throughout October. There's reason CDC December, election matter it'll someone else's problem. Debt collectors making four times much now. actually took time click article you‚Äôd know they‚Äôre stopping portion give severe cases (patients ventilators, icu etc,) continuing non-hospitalized patients.  Somehow surprise me. America all. going get waaayyy worse gets better fucking tragic. Im ashamed American. Europeans want take 33 year old male slave? need awesome European food roof head. swear I'm stereotypical ignorant trump loving fat American! source seems somewhat questionable, idk context such, there's logical issues need addressed.

are comparison's apples apples? assuming similar CDC use math modeling go ""actual confirmed infections"" ""estimated infections"", guy using kind modeling? take total number cases multiply XX, taking account often age group gets tested and/or sufferers death?

have balanced estimate 1st, 2nd, 3rd, developing, 2/3rds world, designation country? estimate biased western countries higher testing assumptions made china india (both good percentage world) testing numbers adjusted percent positive countries? 

lastly, confident every country reporting deaths accurately? even US appears 100k missed data exist 2-8 weeks behind case counts days delayed? say million deaths reality two million two million time bodies pass diagnosis, treatment, hospital, death, would impact IFR%. cold weather sometimes, least near coast. african country colder weather now. Similar climate Spain now. don‚Äôt always see eye eye, appreciate we‚Äôve always able keep even level respect conversations, fuck agree every single character response. bravo. could chance false positive, still wrong things suspected positive. would never come this, customer could theory call secret service, would compel business accept money. I've actually read entirely different story Covid cases among staff Disney. like Spanish Flu symptoms come hard fast kill within 24 hours start symptoms. 

Covid takes time person getting infected going incubation (between 5 14 days average) getting symptomatic severe enough symptoms require hospitalization, ICU treatment, potentially sedation intubation. 

On average, 1/5 people infected C-19 develop breathing difficulties complications require medical care. Though fatality rate lower perfect conditions (medical staff resource needs met), rate hospitalizations massive strain healthcare infrastructure logistics though we've getting better treating disease, medical infrastructure overstretched fatalities shoot we've seen first explosive outbreaks NY/NJ, Northern Italy, elsewhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

Worst case scenario looking possible see widespread outbreak hitting densely populated urban suburban areas well sparsely populated rural suburban areas time. happens, moving resources around meet needs highly impacted areas becomes much difficult impossible due fact areas hit hard once. If/when happens, numbers deaths grow steeply, right away, within weeks case counts rising. ding ding ding.

No wonder people leave. Covid Vaccine vs CyberPunk release got even closer.  It‚Äôs asymptomatic cough certainly affecting draft position. unlikely Cam struggling complications post Covid, struggling ways always has. even somehow struggling Covid struggle would unlikely last weeks. Teams drafting franchise QB weeks college impact. issue federal one... Republicans pulling typical bullshit trying turn tragedy corporate cash grab, ""better"" side help people families staring another shut federal disaster support. government proven poorly operating, best, complete failure worst. Even mostly one side's fault, one side could wield power render whole thing inept shows need massive reform. suspect health care workers first, elderly, professional athletes (gotta sports back). imagine christmas markets concerts planned several weeks ago Germany, everything almost normal? many doctors warned us.

""I've got mine, cares happens you"" position. shush weeb Yes. think lot long-term impact health. many people potential chronic health problems resulting virus.

Have famous people Covid got chronic longterm issues? Nothing shut H1N1, one mandated masks western countries, everyone free live life normal.

&amp;#x200B;

We way cases US (\~60million) way less deaths (\~12k) nowhere near bad covid. Hell, 60k deaths flu years, perhaps people better spreading h1n1.  Take Help Out

There, fixed it. Holy fuck massive dome dont understand per capita bs people pushing. 3000cases doesnt mean us would 100000 cirqumstances. especiallu considering us several cities larger population entire country El Paso Juarez border straight nightmare moment, EVERYONE fucking infected idea much sick people give 7 days, shortage medical workers happen earlier.

The point still uncommon even vast majority reinfections missed, tens millions COVID-19 cases.

Again, fact double hospitalizations exceedingly rare, instead thousands, probably indicates low limit common reinfections point. obsession ""normalcy""

Ofc population size matters. population = higher global share meat production consumption = higher statistical risk zoonosis. factors include example massive population density China.

Gotta tell though work out, maybe large exodus americans country, people go way care rest us live die. That's bad gotten. article makes two assumptions: claim ""10% world infected"" current death count accurate (and unsurprisingly, tries suggest overcount true conspiracist conservative news).

And people always tend say they're right thing compared actually always right thing. interesting documentary made around centennial spanish flu talked deadly. necessarily function virus itself, medical care time.

today someone gets sick podunk nowhere USA, treated local hospital maybe one day sent larger regional hospital, transmission person stops relatively quickly isolation. 

in regards spanish flu soldier foxhole got sick, would sent hospital, recover, he's sent larger allied facility, recover sent back states. transport isolation good today US seeded serious cases (slight genetic mutations?), allied hospitals seeded serious cases, etc etc

States rights ship, again. let get straight. happening right Sweden can't compared happening country, happened Sweden recent past?

So therefore, must judge Sweden's performance based measurable metric, must instead take Tegnell's word it?

Basically anything get elected. still schools open? arguing that, yes need keep beds open, justification using deceiving headlines. 99% full sound negative matter (Most people though 99% capacity meant hundreds people hospital, 31 people 8 needing critical treatment 23 planned released shortly). saying 31 people hospitalized 170,000 honest informative make good headline.

Fuckin New York twice much every day. Sure, turn sensitivity? FFS El Paso fuck bad?

Plus, opinion lockdown delay mechanism, curative tool, way continue delay inevitable stricter stricter rules terrible path go down.

That's they're situation they're now. Goes hand hand ‚Äúcan‚Äôt positive cases don‚Äôt test‚Äù November, i'd say probably time. quick heads something people may realize work hospitals...

Most mid/small hospitals run ~75% ICU occupancy year-round, difference 70-80% may little single patient facilities. worked medium hospital 30 ICU beds. patient would account ~3% change. 

Also, acuity patients matters. patients MUST ICU, maximize profits? Hospitals happily find reasons sit patients ICU beds tick box beds available, COVID patients ""hogging"" ICU beds hospital admins push patients ICUs called med/surg beds. 5-10x med/surg beds ICU beds hopsital.

So NPR says hospitals joining ranks 80% full, understand lot hospitals operate % normally. ""I sure going help, prepared part. makes sense."" That's interesting, also horrifying know. problem starts president Q supporter got brain washed social media. may remember critical raising limit already recommended 500 limit.

And 300 limit announced last Thursday! 
Some people Facebook (myself among others) wondering Tegnell completely mad. Can't see what's happening countries little ahead us development spread? 

And regions like 80 percent population decided keep limit 50. friends event business planned 300 person events cancel them. 

The limit raised all, especially last week constant increase cases month.


Bonus: understand Swedish. Look folkhalsomyndighetens presskonferens april 9 listen Tegnell talking R-value Sweden. currently infected increased 2,5% 5-10% week R-value 1 according Tegnell.

He utterly incompetent sacked long time ago. Im El Paso, crazy. I'll go store friggin packed. really hope people city smack sense cuz look us now. :/ Ok, guess *you're* big fan wave term I'm going argue that.

I'd still like point Tegnell said many countries Europe experiencing second wave reluctant admit Sweden experiencing same. Agree much sentiment. I'm fine people legitimate differences policy, act level indecency we've seen past 4 years nothing short abhorrent pathetic. However alarming contestants come wrong answer high school math question, life death situation. live shut yet due hospital capacity? getting 90?  30 x 5.5 = 165 would lose high school contest failed note cost missing positive greatly outweighs cost extra test. honestly, kids high risk. stupid old ppl open door greet gazillion kiddies like Santa. many seniors who're tired pandemic want return normalcy. Unfortunately, corona Halloween trick keep giving, killing age group. believe schools. see increase immediately, numbers started low takes 1-2 weeks symptoms set in. we're 4th ""2 week block"" since schools re-opening.

Tolstoy wrote length Kingdom God within you. Entire chapters dedicated calling blatantly teaching ignored vast majority Christian authorities.. Well good news say kids asymptomatic safe attend classes. Lol course would let that.

- ICU: 975 (+18)
- New deaths: 274 understand restaurants employ wait staff, right? responder got crass posed this:*Let clear: many successful vaccines created one 7 corona viruses. would zero.*

*Not sure English first language..so maybe there's language barrier.*

So following it, regardless whether deleted not.

The answer one. Moderna's. Look differentiated approach. Look patent challenge lost. Read trial results paper; tactic others. Sure initial booster followup 28 days later, that's hardly inconvenient.

And champion English language, *actually go read research testing results published*.

Then wrote this: 
I'm concerned profits trump vaccine's safety. Pharmaceutical companies *repeatedly* shown profits number one priority.

And response:

This another generalization. Follow particular article; particle company; particular approach; actuals specific vaccine. general population outlier. magically spread mass gathering , somehow virtuous message protests protects everyone involved. us aren‚Äôt cult members think insane. People won‚Äôt act see real danger. US people denying pandemic exists. aren‚Äôt ever going spend prepare might happen. you‚Äôre actively dying propped economy, even call American? playing Coronavirus World Cup

Then don‚Äôt it.

The poster responded Even (second) worst outbreak Europe

So understand country poorly. I'm disagreeing all, CDC's sole job prevent spread communicable diseases. them, evicting people en masse would put onto streets would lead even higher rate infection. think really care rent, etc. attempting control basically completely uncontrolled disease point. Yeah, hate phoning places, sites going maintain delivery sites well.

Personally, make point go restaurant's site, click ""order online"" link, get pickup. thankfully live walkable city/neighbourhood. close schools open bars restaurants. pointed main issue kinds comparisons: US school system sucks compared education worldwide. 

I'm sure Alabama made previous education feel top notch.. wasn't. joke, Alabama education *even joke*. 

All infighting dick measuring states really missing point. Good fucking God. people dumb enough still pull garbage? We've multiple surges already. Deaths always lag cases. locking Thanksgiving New Years?

It sure feels like it. happened people made unable people thousands years.

not saying better it? live Oregon, Idaho running room ERs sending coronovirus patients hospitals Oregon Washington. Meanwhile, half state government believes virus hoax. mean like SARS classification virus tell us day one, ""This flu, bro!""

I still remember felt hearing terrifying descriptions first SARS virus news segments years ago. Guess everybody forgot. point inevitable. Would avoided schools properly managed. least today finally speaking closing schools. huge can't denied anymore media can't keep spreading fake news safe schools are. US 5x Italy's population. Global record adjusted population believe Belgium yesterday. Unadjusted global record India ~98k month two back, doubt stands long current USA increase. lowest got deaths 7 day moving average 7 per day 21st August, peak 1,000 days April. virus never completely went away reasonable refer 2nd wave. There‚Äôs enough people never get vaccine political reasons, I‚Äôm totally fine saying fuck people, I‚Äôm concerned people either can‚Äôt get vaccine medical reasons vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% effective vaccine is. I‚Äôm currently living Italy hope impose another lockdown. hope Sunday. returned little grocery store 2 customers inside time size. 7 people inside distancing. People responsible anymore. needs another lockdown. cant forgive hasnt missed. could seen coming... know we, whole, deserve this. us fighting change longer we've able vote. neoliberalism spread across globe, country could find situation.

Then cried compared week week still tracks week last year let's see coontinues flu season getting started. year year comparison week 43 questionable. whether holds is. 90k, US 5.5x Italy's population. become Idiocracy? pop used tell kid: America shinny shit portapotty. What? Schools procedures place. let kid go Johnny's house pick candy? wrong country. unemployment, closed businesses, lives ruined. Bravo. countries see US? Cause unfortunately large portion country sees itself. We've wearing masks since early March (back CDC/FDA told us worse useless). 

While authority national mask mandate, approve states mandating masks indoor public spaces (which indeed, seems case live people good job following it). I'm wondering long lot healthcare workers Idaho decide stop dealing anti-maskers lack support local governments. Like exodus states prevention taken seriously. problem vitamin c delicious much like candy. good. Getting bottle week. Gonna eat 120 time. good. There's areas country people wear masks? Seriously? Exactly. Natural selection. Solano County California. Commuter towns SF Bay Area. miss 6 months thing? 

Just herd immunity mean nobody get's something, emulating herd immunity wearing masks also doesn't.

What experts said mask wearing, even get covid, chances severe case significantly reduced. would reduced initial viral load. 

If everyone wears masks, number infected drop quickly. goal reduce number infected level that's controllable. They've downplaying virus since day oh god's sake Jesus absolute pacifist. recognized necessity violence certain situations. gun owning American ‚ÄúBible thumpers‚Äù use force animals aggressors, don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre hypocrites.

‚ÄúDo think came bring peace earth; came bring, peace, sword.‚Äù‚Äã‚ÄîMatthew 10:34

Not investing enough country's educational system consequences. takes time, consequences. Yep, Privatize profits, socialize losses. Idaho loves guns, really great economy, really safe place live. would want change? get pointing fingers laughing, people want move hate politics people live there? change politics? make sense me. 

I born raised there, got soon could. love State Idaho, hate politics. that, people want left alone say that. They're insignificant state politically. Movements restricted, non-essential business going close. maximum 1 close contact allowed Thank *god* don‚Äôt live anywhere near inbred bible thumping backwoods motherfuckers. reason people got placebo (theoretically) become positive virus easier come across. speed results showing people placebo arm get whereas (hopefully) people got actual vaccine not.

Dude, that's mission accomplished material US.

Well, tough guy/gal, unsure maybe step COVID unit hospital sans mask. 

I'm betting given opportunity would back down. would probably first smart thing done long time. wish one person spouted ""but many people long term issues!"" would ever actually ONE TIME back sort statistics. kind logic this? smaller landlords interest trying protect tenants. eviction moratorium, would evict anyone couldn‚Äôt pay. big corporations.

It's easy look government spending think every additional dollar spend going hole, lot government spending seen investment... healthier populace naturally productive. Similarly, recall study back, looking amount lead water various areas, remember exact numbers, found every dollar spent remediating lead water supply added something like $1.10 economy, within something like 5 years, due healthier, productive populace... can't look every problem say ""it's expensive help people"". local DMV now. actually quite nice. wait pretty quick compared every time I‚Äôve gone DMV. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ I'd say 75% compliant covering mouth nose, that's enough. even mask correctly , distancing important well. tried avoid many people could. go next week again, think may cancel lockdown then. liking chances right now. im accusing bias. methodology matters: poll? many people polled? one zipcode state? self reporting?

its denialism, things matter conclusions drawn Vote, even Trump third party. taking Wuhan exception, whole China got less infected Taiwan. mean solution give up.

It means spreading doubt misinformation need dealt much quickly severley.

which makes think paranoia second wave that, paranoia bullshit.

there's important metrics absolute number detected cases per day, can't used compare anything.

THE MEMO:

When New Yorker's get virus - sad.

When backwards states get - fault, point finger blame stupid enough get sick. They'll keep us pandemic purgatory forever. renovate border walls unrelated money sake saving lives jobs see can't least try here.

All branches Executive agencies. operate direction President.

If President supports misdirecting funds toward border wall, example, might able get away even though entirely legal.

On hand, try bend rules way President like, agency heads likely fired, prosecuted, both.

It's simply legal, government employees extremely careful follow law.

This situation something career bureaucrats fix. need explicit Congressional action act legally. might accept shady Presidential interference, long allows act impunity. mean makes total sense right wrong reasons.

If half kids symptoms testing still highly selective (either often requiring symptoms need work / travel / confirmed exposure), alone increases actual counts. Throw light symptoms even cases.

Other recent studies suggest counting significant over. Logically long testing even slightly difficult get, you‚Äôre going vastly undercount people lighter cases. kids may schools group settings around adults gives vector exposure done. Lockdowns work. specific, widespread version PCR testing that's used COVID known RT-qPCR (reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR). modern highly specialized test that's specifically designed targets viral RNA. detects presence viral RNA, also quantify amount. means test determine whether viral particles results test determined significant. Typically, amount viral RNA pass specific threshold 30 40 cycles, test deemed negative regardless, even seems trace amounts viral particles.

Kary Mullis invented original PCR test back 1980s, methodologies molecular biology evolved enormously since. even think envisioned test would evolve things sequencing entire human genome. mean non uniformed officers department badge number side gear?

Pretty much puts mid November timeline then, good stuff taste universal healthcare? Seems seem care means taking care irresponsible negligent. Maybe worst passed. then, least younger kids could bit scary. Yeah, feel there. also located around said city. They're already though, unfortunately, need come Idaho. Malheur, Lane, Yamhill, hell even tri-counties (Multnomah, Washington, Clackamas) ample number anti-education virus advocates. almost one fucking videos hillsboro famous footwear long ago. decided need shoes.

Edit: fixed grammatical sentence structure issues. Why? could still solve pandemic way. hurdle selfish humans end all? Perot cost Bush, Clinton, Dole votes, Democrats Republicans likely pushed Commission Presidential Debates increase requirements stage. 

Not like Democrats Republicans well debates, Gabbard excluded meeting requirements Bloomberg paid way in. Ron Paul mostly ignored 2008 2012. Idaho really nothing potatoes agree more. also behind locking down. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Lead drinking water atrocity, overall lead exposure ton lower putting lead directly air leaded gasoline. Despite noisy no-mask protests, 92 percent 2,200 Americans polled say wear face mask leaving home

Let's assume that's actually true. percentage population think infected?

Here, I'll answer you. 

Roughly 9.3M 331M 2.8% first wave Belgium pretty good testing (or declaring person covid). know still case, sure places less testing.

edit: otoh, source worldometer follows 25% positivity rate :( think red scare works well people grew cold War.

I'm 45, first cold related memory fall Berlin wall. personal negative experiences socialism, lots negative experiences unregulated capitalism. generally hear things agree called socialism, positive view perceive (based programs called) socialism. 

I want government seizing factories, judging called socialism, socialism. feeling whole state Idaho bunch crayon eaters. fully confirms thoughts. /r/NoShitSherlock Lol yea dunno. think people feel dems want take guns away, pissed able congregate church covid las vegas allowed reopen. least that's jist stuff ive heard read. check math. forty countries europe eleven monarchs. way less half. think scary right word. serious always scare people. i'm probably communicating well, feels like whole year people scared minor things perfectly comfortable things terrify them. much this. difference astounding. Spanish flu lasted year half barely technology accurate science. little bit. that‚Äôs ok. ;-) also refused close bar owns protest. 

I get Governor going anything might bring wrath Trump. international news consequences getting old... No, hasn't. shit begin with. many times headline going pop up? You‚Äôre aware one example proof? mask mandates appear impact across Europe. pandemic really reason America knows Idaho still exists. ISIS goes book. Christians pick choose book. I'm sure worse. Immigrating United States provided opportunities allowed accumulate wealth. 

I blind massacre bottom three quartiles though. 

The biggest lie almost everybody America fed one step away making big. Fauci ***always*** quoted context!!! see ‚Äúwon‚Äôt back normal 2022‚Äù go YIKES editor cherrypicked clicks Fauci actually said (I watched interview Jennifer Garner) discussing returning Broadway theaters ***he*** person high risk due age gender ‚Äî would people high-risk able safely sit hours ***in packed theater*** said probably 2022.

In recent months he‚Äôs consistently said Fall 2021 pretty much normal. qualifies people (high-risk) activities (the risky) longer. 

And things begin open soon vaccine widely available ‚Äî late spring? shit I, even radical overhaul America, still hold resentment bile heart forever. Wow, California well. suppose governor strict regulations working all. desert? Mathew 24:26 predicted he'd there! phenomenon seems pretty universal across western world. seems like ingrained cultural problem. High mask compliance undoubtedly stopped pandemic tracks am. testing stats 5% positive since June, daily case could flat 10% April peak. Traffic back, people working, public transit open. Yet spike. Truly, one biggest mysteries ever! someone lives next door Idaho, confirm happens people get education book ""mummy deddy"". need cited boss man. PCR process works. amplifies ever there. make direct point, asymptomatic people test positive virus disease. asymptomatic people myth too? Judging comment sounds like much lacking department. Don‚Äôt generalize people tool half country wants safe. AHEM

Vermin Supreme. We‚Äôll hot damn. That‚Äôs one way doesn‚Äôt. Scary wrong word, that's H1N1 serious. Yes, everyone need vote, even Republicans. mean already haven‚Äôt? recent data/information show regarding likelihood transmission mail, boxes groceries? extensive studies opinions?

Thanks Maynard Keenan Tool/APC/Puscifer February says lasting lung damage lingering cough. great professional singer. Interesting graphic trying ‚Äúcontain‚Äù it. think that‚Äôs new them. M4A would cost *less* spend Medicare/Medicaid VA today.

Every penny pay pocket medical care medical insurance, every penny employer pays, added together, less cost bureaucracy profits greed system. 

To put another way, every cent pay medical care/insurance employer pays, goes profit/fraud/waste. 50m??? They're saying article, consciously cough tell difference forced cough, like doctor puts stethoscope chest asks cough. We've interfered state matters national concerns -- see: minimum drinking age state matter pushed federal government. Yes, it‚Äôs nothing compared what‚Äôs come, trends don‚Äôt change. Yea see I'm rich america want lazy poor people getting free shit! wanted chime in, think Ada county hospitals full think away mask mandate. think mask mandate Panhandle district, largest City (Coeur 'd Alene) put mandate immediately that. Hospitals full transferring, well parts southern Idaho (twin falls), they're transferring Boise. looking good anywhere, closest good Ada county. Duh area purple politically, outskirts big metro area. closest grocery 20% massless pricks. go country, proportion goes up. go ‚Äúblue collar‚Äù business, proportion goes (e.g. 0% Jiffy Lube employees wear masks). certainly don‚Äôt trust normal mechanic, literal cross made tools logo. Normally would care religion politics, fact need virtue signal religion tells super weary asses. Evangelicals particular seem think sort magical Jesus armor, even though bunch local outbreaks churches in-person inside services.

On hand, go closer city dang lib‚Äôruls, mask wearing community responsibility goes up. It‚Äôs incredible awful conservative Christians acting. Breathtaking hypocrisy, though that‚Äôs nothing new. Please show evidence masks N95 equivalent work. 


From CDC medical masks (also known surgical masks) loose-fitting devices designed worn medical personnel protect accidental contamination patient wounds, protect wearer splashes sprays bodily fluids (36). limited evidence effectiveness preventing influenza virus transmission either worn infected person source control worn uninfected persons reduce exposure. systematic review found significant effect face masks transmission laboratory-confirmed influenza. Pretty fucking crazy us gotta tell ya. 
At least perspective New Englander.  well.. sucks suck, landlord Yes, amazing science evolve data acquired. one going herd immunity. Americans anything spare department! wish good answer that. instinct wants say scientists/medical professionals strong desire create vaccines, going work tirelessly get there.  much internet suck damaging, certainly better access communities ever before. would think entities make progress toward vaccine, they'd sharing colleagues maybe brain power thrown pandemic, get better quicker. iirc fauci said early pandemic makes suggestions work everyone say reacted. that's kind position in. whether h1n1, sars, mers, ebola disease, prevented becoming global pandemic victory. allowing break containment infect world failure. relevant comment entire post. sad nobody really cares. New York New Jersey around 140+/100,000 comparison. 

But hey, words ‚Äútriple digit increase‚Äù ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù sound alarming right? Pair picture lady mask people might forget Maine one safest states. Oh God always state shit much winning literally hurts think people would evolved bit 100 years smarter.

Nope. Yes, even cheaper anything. Actually average death age 80+ get throw moochers government teat bonus !!!!

That's design; newspaper want read ti decide times things different good bad way. Almost certainly true.

It's incredibly frustrating see much research time wasted antibody treatments used long virus stopped replicating body. thing happened plasma remdesivir studies. I'd even say kind thing part reason HCQ saga went long (the poor design protocols meant drug's supporters convinced evidence inefficacy).

Then media gets hold studies cites proof treatment work all. depends done. treat covid spit. so

This really true. sounds like someone rolling dice whatever comes action applied. happening. aren‚Äôt taking measures based infections coming from.

Because one knows infections (more 70% it) coming from. can't act data have. could solve problem gun, syaing. Currently reinfection #17 :( seen happening? unless flat disregarding difference ""lockdown skeptic"" ""denier"" again.

The headline leaves units, ambiguous little shoddy. Damn leaf peepers!!!!! compromise first set thanks corruption kept US behind basically every nation. part federal government granted authority constitution regulate clothing, believe strict interpretation constitution government explicity granted authority something shall always quoted context

It's intentional. People want say best fits narrative, amd distort lie achieve goal.  Wtf? understand symptomatics viral load asymptomatics?  saying symptomatics actually infected now? Yes. Something significant surely would made news? Every epidemic/pandemic end eventually. That's we're point unfortunately. Oh, we're looking catch up! Key West numbers surging again.

Also, covid tests aint shit idahoans afraid absolutely mindless. laughed v hard area within last months nursing homes dozens cases, patients would almost always sent hospital days released back, early pandemic requiring high fevers multiple days admission. present moment, given hospital capacities i'd imagine likely right going forward looking backwards treating people various times year. part/amendment? obviously false let pose question masters russia,china, and.

even pessimistic experts like Osterholm said ""going biggest wave all"" still implies things get better winter spike. gotta tough next months. 

anyway, 2022 probably realistic return full normalcy. pandemic devastates economy, destroys thousands jobs, spikes everyone's anxiety roof return normal like snap finger vaccine coming out. 

but realistically, 6 8 weeks available general public, events coming back distancing going away. masks probably required airports, congregate care facilities, doctor offices. economy still shit. people still edge. wanna go friends go baseball game show something summer able that. that's first step.

It would pretty useful sub. Well said. that's number matters. Younger people less likely hospitalized cause problems road. Also long haul effects disastrous yet done require hospitalization. Soooooooo many people reporting memory recollection issues, tachycardia, chronic fatigue. people never needed go hospital. also wonder residents countries often attach big ass flags vehicles. seeing lot lately driving around, nowhere near parade sort. honestly hate safety hazard. think uncounted deaths it‚Äôs still dangerous, think like realistically maybe 0.4 ifr Holy crap that's huge number - there's even million people whole state. Yeeeeey.....? Sexist! might think obvious.

But know people gave virus September heard news vaccine would ready November. vaccine available 2 months time meant care anymore obvious nevertheless experience.

Most folks think terms numbers, really follow things sub think ""obvious"". funny became narrative soon IFR started drop 1%. absolutely proof long term issues, judging banter sub pretty much guaranteed catch Covid lose least one lung. Florida dropped 7th place nationally per capita basis, drop even 8th place later today Wisconsin reports daily number Trick treating outdoors masks right? supposed totally safe right!? Public health officials thought making recommendation based ""new data"" would uncontroversial, would better lock supply chain PPE first cautioning everyone protect drying supply, recommend public use masks.

This failed spectacularly 

1) People saw happening respiratory illness bought PPE (or scummy people, scalp)

2) want used earlier *STOP BUYING MASKS PEOPLE* comments justify masks useless etc. We've known since pandemic since we've studied known human coronaviruses longer 2020... lot wars fought name Christendom, america's wars either! weird that's kind go to. WWJD?

I'm always fucking amazed AI. mean we're speaking 4000 training samples getting good accuracy. fucking efficient compared normal testing process. app asap, AI get accurate makes wonder else could detect future, lung cancer &amp; flu? many people think live uk? 40 million people 75% population... local police forces equipped arrest people walking around without masks? isn‚Äôt sneaky high level stuff. literally see mask doesn‚Äôt. boss died home weekend week outbreak, counted died alone confirm prior symptoms. first dozen deaths witnessed health facilities around city counted either travelled internationally therefore fit criteria public health viral spread confirmation. 

When eventually look back tally normal death counts, like places world we'll see huge spike 'normal' deaths obviously unreported COVID-19 related fatalities. 

Personally think Ontario track par, perhaps even over, global average 10 times deaths reported. feel like they‚Äôre people, louder bolder. lived Idaho large portion life, moving LA work returned home March due pandemic. tell mindset people toxic. live across street elderly care center. seen ambulances firetrucks carting people almost daily. see people holding anti mask freedom signs street corner blocks away. astonishing, people truly free push narrative without much resistance. Everyone quick support ideas white republican.

 People saying bad place live defending might good experience, would defence. spending good amount time away behavior much less acceptable me. used see culture, really extremist mentality boiling cauldron together. 100% trump country see changing anytime soon. saw massive influx conservative homebuyers year people ""fleeing liberal states"". started town I'm made news george fluid militia ""protecting local businesses"". took opportunity walk crowd here, even town, pretty clearly excuse show dominance drink beer brandishing firearms public. seen influx behavior various reasons including open protests mask mandates health board passed county. 

Rant over, I'm returning LA today. Going refreshing away ignorance. miss close friends family. Good people live mess, dictate culture. seen lot friends years go dark paths trying adapt culture somewhat impressionable people. sad see. Wow, ass. know situation all. sincerely hope forgot put /s end that. showing Bible gun? fucking serious gun bible. two mix together US police enforcement lockdown selective probably racialized, hopefully still lowers mobility without cops involved. workers it? Every day rocking work full ppe. going ages still Perhaps misunderstood? I'm saying idiots refuse follow safety guidelines(wearing face masks that) keep us pandemic pugatory forever, never suggested now. Calm down. purchased n95 mask way back Febuary. kept one wound donating rest local hospital. I'd wager good chunk people followed sub knew masks work. Ron DeSantis fucking care. He‚Äôs busy shoving sandwiches maw save citizens. science indicates masks work make sick one follows proper protocol handling them. minority, thin margin still amounts 100 million people geographically everywhere. concentrated Dakotas, would like okay, well stay hell away there. know anti maskers across world even people murdered people asked wear mask elsewhere world, probably highest concentration fools frustrating. embarrassed. cult individual liberties notion owe nothing society pervasive US frankly unsustainable. society function large percentage population feels like owe anything one another. People video: doesn‚Äôt matter there‚Äôs pandemic not, told wear mask stand 6ft apart takes us feel oppressed enough brandish guns! going ignore large gatherings still occur virtually technology didn‚Äôt exist time founding fathers! (Oh, racial discrimination going greatest nation earth; minorities bunch cry babies!) Well, symptoms caused mutation protein folding happened covid19 MAYBE possible target specific shaped protein. one especially tricky mechanism virus employs everywhere could also biggest weakness vs virus many different complex stages vary wildly one patients genetics next. One powerful mechanism might easier block many somwhat independent mechanisms. 

Best could positive spin. yeah, millions people worst year collective lives footnote history within 100 years. change much year sucks, help know talk grandkids covid dominate conversation anymore 1918 pandemic dominated conversation year  Typical typical Texas cops  can‚Äôt create enforce mandates either things. would work? Yes, yes, go whole US would 3 million active 300k per day (rounded), hmm, arizona peak perhaps? nah, would take 7,000 per day ten days. damn 1% lot.

reminds old math problem, lily pads double size every day long take fill pond? something like that, well day full 50, day 25, 12, 6, 3, 2, 1 (rounded course) 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625 etc etc small numbers one cared ""oh shit"" moment realized days lily pads taking over. 

i wonder states act faster stop spread covid Yeah masks worked back then, I've never heard pandemic Yes, wait moment hospitals pick choose treat urgent care. Canada half hospital beds available. I've never understood really that. public masks, less people would wound hospitals begining. healthcare workers would better protected deal many covid patients. lmao gave award Thank level headed. parents live Idaho recently contracted virus. wear masks careful social distancing. thought dying fucking morons like Janice McGeachin terrifies me. Masks controversial.

20% world fucking wankers. thinking risk community spread, wrong way: community spread risk kept low overall adults reducing vector activity, children school increase community risk 'normal' level. community spread limited, children going school elevates risk unacceptable level. priority: adults eating inrestauramts, kids school?

It's like this: living apartment complex allows pets, everyone uses flea &amp; tick meds healthy pets (most population), population sick old *can't* take flea meds still protected. people use flea &amp; tick prevention young healthy animals allow healthy animals carry fleas, old &amp; sick animals suffer infestation and/or thing is, flu fucking mess. want know mutates fast? I'll tell you:

Inside influenza virus capsule one strand RNA, several. two different flus infect organism, actually infect cell time. build flu capsules inside cell then, separate strands RNA actually mix together swapped around. mean, producing thousands copies per cell need couple dozen actually viable get exponential growth.

So yeah, flus play mix-and-match that's hard tell main one going like year year.

The dominant covid strain one spreads most. mean lot things, like reduced symptoms, also mean increased virulence, extended contagious periods without symptoms, reduced immune memory. Also, Covid going evolve lot slowly flu. decades centuries may settle fifth seasonal coronavirus cold, that's going take long time. What's difference? still aren‚Äôt ceiling 

cases per million: \~33,800. GA's Dakotas, getting South Dakota 44,559 confirmed cases total state population 884,659. 5,037 cases per 100,000 people, 5.0% population.

North Dakota even worse, 42,488 confirmed cases total state population 762,062. 5,575 cases per 100,000 people, 5.6% population.

[New York Times US Coronavirus Yes Yes. Navarra small huge impact Spain overall performance.

Surprise Murcia. Official data says 1.600 cases. roughly 1.100 yesterday (x3 single say).

I know happened there. expect backlog. even better data missintroduction... honestly: know.

Also: check data non official news says 800 today (which would huge increase anyway) area restrictions, still happening. Go see family. interesting San Francisco often listed ideal city look 1918 pandemic. 

However look carefully(2015 article) happened 3 weeks time, deadly virus far Three-plus weeks later, authorities decided epidemic slowed enough rescind mask law. noon Nov. 21, whistles blew San Franciscans joyously threw hated masks street trampled city reinstated mask law Jan. 17, even though increasing evidence masks didn‚Äôt now, however, city fed up. business community complained, private citizens. ‚ÄúAnti-Mask League,‚Äù included doctors several supervisors, held public meeting attended 2,000 Feb. 1, supervisors determined epidemic wane again, Rolph rescinded mask order, time good. fall, epidemic history. apologize u think harsh, agree w u, point make idaho democratic ease grip conceritives like legalized Marijuana pump money education, surrounded states w legalized pot loosing millions states also try push church government history blindly targeting mexican population (i mexican) 12 them? almost like ostriches sticking heads sand. Except fact sticking head sand actually prevent inhaling corona virus. make relevant law concerning masks. registered Gab profile January 2018 handle ‚Äúonedingo‚Äù; described account following: ‚ÄúJews children Satan (John 8:44).

Do comments Christian driven attacks abortion probably won‚Äôt many people sick, I‚Äôm taking risk year. Local public health agencies also need cover asses case another big spike cases due Halloween. Masks social distancing may slow spread idea ""keeping around"" nonsense, virus never going magically vanish. fact detracting natural ""end point"" highly infectious viruses herd immunity. Brawndo. wish lived Idiocracy world. Cause actually listened smartest guy world. Meanwhile real world Dr. Fauci security family received death threats. ""president"" ...unless live area government's implementing restrictions holiday gatherings, course. (Where live, *recommendations*.)  Necessary proper clause? want us fun. Federally illegal smoke weed frolic naked outside. ""his right""? 

your algorithm's broken, pavel switzerland strain.  Idaho 100% women. Also snakes, spiders, high housing costs. Best keep moving Wyoming presidents/governers saying 

""if dont follow fucking rules going 2nd lockdown""

instead say way 2nd lockdown everyone thinks everything fine Perhaps level 3 restrictions brought earlier: closing restaurants. current harder lockdown, regain control much sooner. Managing pandemic really hard. South Korea never locked down. competent testing, tracing quarantining. reason US done that.  Rednecks come shapes sizes Members regional health department board voted Thursday repeal local mask question rhetorical. I‚Äôm saying (the people) pay lot taxes don‚Äôt seem get anything it, like decent health care education agree FHM probably call surge beginning second wave, unlike really care call it. seem obsessed Sweden. understand threads New Zeeland write in, since covid-19 less non-existent there, got threads celebrate increased number cases. two things notice this, modeling axis total positive cases daily growth? i'd imagine would create two vastly different equations, perhaps one accurate other? combination would accurate, since get one need addition anyway.

if experience taught percentage errors, way self correct 14 21 day points graph see reduces prediction error? took extrapolated (but self corrected) data fed back in, could iterate times make original prediction better? without plugging excel i'm sure would happen know much effort time actually wanting put haha Confirmation/follow testing. Depending country, am, positive test, perform second one x days. 

So let‚Äôs say close contact someone corona, test positive go mandatory isolation 14 days. corona-rangers test see I‚Äôm Merde Nope. chances dropping highly unikely. experiencing continue vaccine available public.

All prep protect much then. time, society continue function like nothing happens happens you. Yet speck dust universe one cares about, except family friends. keep calm carry on.

It's universe works. wish different not. 

Stay healthy~ thanks. got norovirus cruise get another boat again. Gross I've shouting last 4 months so. Yes, likely die COVID particular moment. No, better cheaper reopen long term expenses occur future complications due infected COVID. preventative healthcare much cheaper emergency care. Treat problem small and/or localized price cheaper. Treat problem large and/or widespread price expensive. rocket science. Watching US right like watching rich kid total dad's bugatti...  See, CDC? we‚Äôve lost faith you. bought couple boxes back late January. bought intention shipping in-laws China. Never got chance. Ended giving friend OBGYN using cloth masks. course not, always risk taking becoming landlord. knew would go court system remove someone could delayed number reasons even covid. like business risky, sometimes lose. would think Trump would admitted hoax he, wife child caught it. Instead said barron needed 1 tissue. 

I call bullshit Exactly, chance show leadership early days covid. Romney calling 2k relief, marching protest. 

But balls that. Yea that‚Äôs common Fox News talking point. :( *probably* Let's see what's judges mind, Monday morning. form Czech rep.? Romney 2012 we'd lot better situation. OK troll seriousness though well truly fucked Seems like lot states setting unwanted records minute. feel like they'll never close borders 3 states. live border town 2 many people live Idaho drive work shopping could Idaho Glad better governor reinfection, probably given enough time, second infection likely less bad cells ~~He's judge court.~~ He's County Executive. *do* ignore County order City government tells too, City boss, County. belongs legal team City City Council fight court. Chief said would follow order, would immediately fired someone would enforce would replace heartbeat.

Edit: Learned something. funny believes that. US stopped supporting ""main street"" decades ago. think France Spain #1 #2 tourism world anybody know there's like 'dark Santa' make wishes would technically make 'bad boy'? reports said evaporate matter weeks/months?

This either side points ""science"" defend either position parrots respective echo chambers opinions fact immediately know there's intelligence used.

As everything life answer always lies middle. Take sides use logic synthesize different fact patterns come rational conclusion. That's intelligence.

This pandemic somewhere apocalyptic event nonevent. total number cases ever recorded state bit misleading figure. better metric active cases hospitalizations context beds available? Perhaps percentage tests positive? purpose surmise publishing biggest number find play fear outrage factor? I'm downplaying severity pandemic trying understand earth we'd use number. accurately depict situation ground all. Yeah. Next time opposition needs put billboard saying ""Your Lt. Gov likes thank donating dead Potato Fertilizer Pandemic."" pictures bibles, casket lowered field, burning American flag draping casket, gun held maniacally laughing Lt. Gov. Sure cases increasing, live life floating petri dish. Sure. limit n95s. Either way April knew masks work. almost November people say begining said I'm gonna wear one. exactly neighbor used line me. really nice guy, almost like family. started watching Fox news lot last years. do? Go gym. heart attack died. I'm saying got covid you, 76 year old high blood pressure going gym, top fact covid exists? told going. worried. Sad. want unnecessary deaths better nation. Let's start acting like it. Yes, isolated domestic terrorist acts occurring every couple months (or projected potentially occur) issue level countries islamic terrorism problems see. Look France month Got next? never got ride begin with, we're taking train way, first moon, first 100% infected baby. Pretty sure Parson's still idiot. much pay people? fire her? states laws place put extremely high tax rates selling rental property. IL rental property would need non rental property year get hit taxes. sell rental property, I'm looking 38% tax rate. simple.  Yay California. good! See pocket cases northern tip Cali? Thats republican territory. Figures. wonder anything interesting noteworthy happened 1918? üòê Going real ISIS vibe. Remember numbers following trend much record us numbers. Also know we're open less half cases is. Police Chief following orders *his* boss, City Council. City Police Chief answer County Judge. mayor boss fucking County judge

It's still contempt court, matter employer is. treated like it‚Äôs big issue islamic terrorism isn‚Äôt anywhere close big issue.

DHS said alt right extremists biggest domestic threat violence it‚Äôs evident alt right extremists often Christian Crack pipe Biden jr would never denied covid deaths like this. Truly appalling. known part Trump cult antivax conspiracy kooky shit. Lol really don‚Äôt give fuck wins not, long don‚Äôt you. Remember, shiny part aluminum foil hat points keep TV rays hypnotizing taking FEMA concentration camps. Don‚Äôt waste foil meth keep away shit. never job serve protect people. That's marketing department. Defund work guess 200,000 400,000 Neither he. County Judge boss, City Manager answers City Council. capacity abstract empathy. That's why, many years now, we've calling fucktards ""vanilla ISIS."" good place years 50% food soft drinks ¬£10 per person. food bill ¬£50 2 people would pay ¬£20, would max discount.

It successful restaurants packed contributed current situation. Wait, fuck Michael Bay now? make one google equally sad backwards states disappointed killing part sorry can't see family year üòî went outdoor bar shortly numbers skyrocketed even comfortable it. go indoor bar now?

**End Date:** Open Germany, people blame visitors ~~to~~ returning east Europe spread virus, I'd like ask narrative UK. (Also wonder party-people-strain Germany, too). Well, wrong say that. many others knew masks somewhat effective. showing people trying blow candles masks experiments blacklight droplet experiments came out. Sometimes common sense good science. Would scenario play someone state murdered killed traffic accident something? Neither state would report it?

Or happening covid stuff many deaths can‚Äôt track all? poster didn‚Äôt say county live could google it? hard figure which. Love this! I‚Äôm sitting home basement 24/7 quarantine currently get don‚Äôt spread kids wife I‚Äôm absolutely furious. regular customer came 3-4x week average I‚Äôm going banning premises return it‚Äôs damn irresponsible likely following orders coming City Council, real bosses. fired time. exactly superiors telling do. Hunter Ellis takes helluva photo. order court something ignore. Ya don‚Äôt say  we'll break 90 100 today would really screw trips Ontario weed. No, understand chain command. confusing County City government situation. Wow must taken down. Tough nails probably new lockdown next week. situation different region region still difficult. Lombardy (especially Varese, Milan Monza) situation dramatic. area Caserta Naples Campania.

Regions like Calabria, Molise, Lazio, Sardinia Emilia Romagna situation holds. Lazio rate positivity 8% despite fact Rome populous city country.

From one week curfew 12pm (you go except work) 6 bar restaurant closed (can work takeaway). recreational activity (theaters, non-professional sports, cinemas, etc.) closed while.

The state already provided subsidies funding affected activities.

As number tampons less week, capacity increased least 30%. Every day break record new tampons.

New covid centers opened, nurses hired doctors recalled. something 3 months ago.

In many regions tracking system totally skipped (which becomes complex positivity rate 5%).

It would case close several regions long ago disputes local administrators allow it.

Newspapers says Conte's speech Sunday evening anticipate national lockdown early Monday November 9 latest.

It yet clear kind lockdown be:

1. hard March French one.
2. ""Soft"" open activities March, freedom movement municipality, possibility make list people visited individually.

I hope second option. go psychological training tests 1 year allowed carry firearm Flex hard (please adopt me) enough masks makes sense first protect exposed virus likely spread vulnerable people: healthcare workers. That's also they'll get first vaccines too. makes sense. mean would police rely judges judgment? like would need judges opinion anything...  they‚Äôre like cocaine canaries. 

New band name. 2018, apparently El Paso 24 murders.

So far year, they've 595 covid deaths.

Seems like enforcing coronavirus measures Corona virus over. Go open shop kick start economy. personally know 10 people covid health effect. 70% death people 70+ age 94% of. death underlying conditions. open economy cause tired seeing people loosing jobs. feel vague sense pride CDC, Atlanta. Maybe related hospitals, likely folks metro Atlanta know people involved medical field, thus better chance understanding reality situation. Dunno, I'm grateful either way bad places. base comment on? disobeyed boss, would keep job? County Judge Police Chief's boss; City Manager is. Police Chief cannot ""go rogue"" else would fired. whatever saying blessing City Manager City Council. produced movie pandemic, lockdowns years, martial law not. called Songbird. saying you‚Äôve tested positive 3 separate times? Gotcha. want believe *miss* 70% cases.


Have good weekend. ‚ÄúMovement‚Äù ‚Äúenjoyment property‚Äù God given rights? test, swabbed back mouth. closely exposed, got tested week later (quarantined), negative result. Back work. 2 days later, sick hell. Fun.  I‚Äôd say: mandate masks, give fines don‚Äôt wear them, close restaurant dining in, office buildings employees work remotely MUST work remotely. Avoid public gatherings parties etc. close schools COMPLETELY, cases dramatically lower, also give increased wage compensation healthcare / essential workers risking lives everyday stupid government.  Hey, jotting note Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada gone red status. Manitoba 480 cases today, record breaking 193 yesterday. believe latent contacts thanksgiving occurred weeks ago may be. 

Stay safe everyone! I've noticed this. Portland/Vancouver even seemed avoid outbreak. Hopefully things go sideways... long, dark, cool, rainy winter them. According [CDC's ""Planning IFR 20-49 year old age range estimated 0.02% (based ""most likely scenario""), effectively 1/5,000. Since broad estimate goes way 49 year olds, likely risk likely even *much* lower people 30 years age. 

For 50-69 year olds IFR spikes 0.5%, 70 starts get really scary. Honestly would want anyone risk getting side effects, expecially young kids. Cause dumb fucks 1918, too, huh? suggest? virus far control use measures Spain. Uh, yes? Yup. go anywhere. place go get gas sometimes go gas station beer cigarettes father. still 1 n95 kept that. others like said donated. I'm park, wear cloth mask, copper fibers surgical mask underneath. I'd rather overdo it. like tell others wrong. Meanwhile home sit watch dumpsters burn ground say ""it is""  thought first wave done yet? like hydroxychloroquine stories back March CDC announced crossed 9 million positive week? going keep happening get worse unless western governments able come solution isn‚Äôt ‚Äústay inside don‚Äôt see friends family go school restaurants anything indeterminate amount time.‚Äù like flash hit streaming movie exclusive netflix end 2018 reduction viral load interesting, figured happening due social distancing, masking, reductions length contacts.

Along better understanding therapeutics, makes sense infection fatality rate 2nd wave significantly less 1st. kind ‚Äúenforcement‚Äù looking for? shit 2nd quarantine due exposure work. (Central Minnesota, 100 miles north metro area) hope it‚Äôs matter time. at-home saliva test today. breeze! Pretty sure herd immunity crowd thinks that. can't find solid data suggest reaction vaccine would depend whether neighbor vaccinated almost 17% increase last Friday, Sunday. We'll see weekend goes determine Sunday type peak. Thanks crazy way schools reopenings handled. Yes, smartest move, whatever did, know masks work. intentionally obtuse dismiss now. studies show work. Countries shown early mask wearing good testing contact tracing still relatively normal life. wanna buy air bags? Maybe texas im thinking figured states people owned guns Interesting. know that. Regardless, falls squarely City Council ultimate say whether comply not. Feels like getting shirk limelight here. way see hospital usage history going back beginning first peak? Would nice know stand relation that. Zlatan: ""First went left; too. went right too. went left went buy hotdog.""

You gotta love guy Imagine wanting accountability. days positivity rate went 34% get fooled numbers.

The 34% little second third swabs (still there) compared 24% today real new positive/new swabs percent.

The problem could get swab back strict conditions asymptomatic lot less now. Actually average age new cases lot lower before. $$$$$$ Yeah pretty nervous see what‚Äôs going happen. sense another shopping surge election lot rioting increase cases again. I‚Äôm scared say least. Thank you, stay safe well! definitely not, fraudulent data case number inflation. 

I'm European. country monarchy. issue guns bible nothing antiquated, not. 

One thing Jesus violence fit well together. know ""christians"", say looks like outside. looks people really christian, wanting maintain certain way life aspect christianity added kind condiment, like going church, puritan morals stuff like that. see Jesus all. atheist, think issue know people consider real christians.

If need guns ""defend yourself"" I'm thinking may want look need exists first place. guess guns reasons need guns defend yourself. start reducing number guns circulation.

I care something tradition not. wrong, get rid it. goes monarchy country. much practical significance, ridiculous anachronism. I'm it. go away say, we're rounding turn, we're rounding corner, going away.

- [Trump debate Biden last Uh huh. one hand use real numbers (230,000). Yet ""extrapolate"" large number made up-yet still fit earlier figure-at all.

Inferred != made up. CDC officially proposes .65%. numerous studies converge range. BTW, official death number relies significant extent inference well.

Please, though, go ahead give plausible estimation number low behavioral action snuff virus. Keep mind took Victoria 3 months prison state get zero causes starting less prevalence. I'm Belgian although look many answers (one highest populous densities Europe, biggest logistical hub Europa, crossing country multiple nationalities, 6 different parliaments enforce rules separately) real cause found Je m'en Fou attitude Belgians. stopped caring. see everywhere, even parents (60 years old, teachers), go visit people time. go work, also go visit people free time.

The situation Europe worrying, healthcare level. suffer economic damage second time (and maybe third fourth fifth..) creating huge gap economies west east. I'm utterly worried. Worried children living standard me.

If look successful Australia New Zealand, especially Asian countries (while staying OPEN!!!!) bunch amateurs. want get radical, app, mandatory, tracks locations people infected, whole EU, implemented. Giving one aspect privacy freedom gouvernement gain whole lot freedom side. freedoms becoming burden. Also people enough willing throw every piece privacy net give location away Samsung , Apple, Google, Facebook etc. gouvernement ow no. get wrong I'm first defend values French Revolution. get solution using right tools. moment use tools. sorry lockdown tool, that's replacing one health crisis another. countries infected compared Sweden there's small chance ever posed treath them.

Besides that, Sweden could closed borders like New Zealand, didn't. **Community outbreaks Covid-19 often emerge Trump‚Äôs campaign campaign made stops nationwide. Coronavirus cases surged wake least five estimates actual daily cases Belgium right now? Considering high positivity rate I'd assume multiple times official figure. vocal minority. E WA nearly bad midwestern states. think Utah eventually break 10 thousand cases per day? entire US well ND right now, would expect 5,599 daily national deaths 584,426 new daily cases. Yep, rocking it... Logically first wave last winter (spring) second wave winter (fall).

Europe, unlike US, suppressed summer clear delineation. post school project. 

In America citizens able expected give select rights hobbies duties order respond modern day crisis. current scenario COVID-19, American citizens expected give right assembly. reason assembly raises risk transmission virus, infected meeting groups raises chances infection. Furthermore, going public risking infection could considered attack American people. increased transmission rate going could mean infecting persons rely work order feed families pay bills. irresponsible persons going possibly infecting said persons, people longer able feed children and/or pay bills. Additionally continuing go public result halt production certain items individuals work processing plants different factories infected result spread virus like wild fire. factories plants stop producing left certain shortages items. California multiple areas operate different levels opening different zones changing throughout state, result massive spikes cases. reason is, different zones numbers may low areas might high counts next zone lack consistency causes unbalanced numbers people continue travel zones higher states re-opening risk transmission start whole process again. 

Again school assignment. Ignore let know opinions, you. caught coronavirus twice, work summer around small family event outing. swear way aggressive colder months around first came out, got mild went away fast. I‚Äôm curious see bad it‚Äôll get winter.

Edit: Read later comments myself, I‚Äôm virologist. I‚Äôm 100% certain got first time however symptoms didn‚Äôt get diagnosed new. company handles products Toyota, ford, Toyo Seat, Mitsubishi, etc. transmission vectors far globally cold/chilled food handling cruise ships worst.

We definitely don‚Äôt need cruises right now. 2.5 still high though. knows long term effects life expectancy. Early deaths COVID likely occurring long time pandemic stopped. Folks returned last 2-week school/All Saints holiday yet... want police defunded military grade weapons.

Many police services around world get fine unarmed uniformed officers. RCMP Canada get sidearm (usually revolver), shotgun trunk car. Hell, better first aid kit weapons collection trunk car. Yes agree vaccine combined safety measures certainly help anything. 

I guess I‚Äôm mainly worried anti-mask crowd also camp ‚Äúthe virus going plant tracking chip you.‚Äù vaccine table virus isn‚Äôt even big deal first place. 

Even aside conspiracy nuts, lot folks worried vaccine ‚Äúrushed.‚Äù People act like vaccine going end pandemic, certainly hope be, yeah worry vaccine available, people going truly done safety measures go back pre-pandemic life we‚Äôre ready yet. Romney Republican one‚Äôs Trumpite.

One Boise rural Idaho. tommorrow rush non essential stores. 
Imagine rush toystores, store, etc... Depends consider law. Europe tends strong central governments absolute authority locales. US federation strong local authority. quite cut dry may used to. early narrative likely infect touching surface touching mask. primary source infection physical rather respiratory. don‚Äôt care smart are, medical experts pushing would argue it? None us mask experts. aren‚Äôt experts droplets things spread. don‚Äôt think fair say common sense hindsight. least seems leveled off. Hope starts fall. think level truth it, said something particular localised area. Kind like people refute climate change taking photo snow *somewhere* world. Yeah, think coming weeks absolute madness. definitely uneasy say least. Stay safe friend. Uh huh. one hand use real numbers (230,000). Yet ""extrapolate"" large number made up-yet still fit earlier figure-at all.

Great job convincing me, good weekend. not? aren‚Äôt anything stop spread way?

The US Surgeon General said masks could harm good. feel bit insane trying say, online strangers, ""well, think I'm right CDC Surgeon General full shit"".  Usually academics people involved (e.g. Americans even then, need interested know) know things.

[Here two good safety discussed /r/covid19.

With ivermectin, outside loaisis, risk *very low*. sold counter countries. Someone posted /r/ivermectin giving 5-year-old daughter treat worms.

It's approved two parasites FDC, recommended CDC scabies lice.

I'm aware safer drug -- know much. know safer aspirin, [which kills 3000/year Ivermectin safer penicillin, [kills 500/year safer NSAIDs like ibuprofen; [NSAIDs kill 16,500 Americans - yet sold counter.

Serious question: pandemic led looking things, would guessed aspirin penicillin pretty safe. drugs comparable therapeutic effect (leaving covid19, like) better safety record? must Marik also arguing article may unethical test ivermectin placebo.

AFAIK (could wrong!) relatively covid-19 related RCTs *any* drug US, part concern. Daniel Griffin complained repeatedly Week Virology. also problem trials completed date, e.g. 2 (or 3?) compared ivermectin + doxycycline HCQ + azithromycin (IVM + DOXY better). dealing fatal disease, withholding *all* treatment raises pronounced ethical problems.

On hand, ivermectin *is* benign drug, used [at least 16 countries fight tried tally, number people taking ivermectin prevent catching covid19 treat virus must millions. used Uttar Pradash, example, India's populous state 204 million people (I know widely). There's almost negative feedback used (there news stories bad effects missionaries injecting animal form drug Peru, IIRC, based comments one radio personality -- credible IMO).

By stage pandemic, every US hospital standard care. see ethical problem giving ivermectin randomly-selected subset covid19 patients trial, addition standard care. FDA approved 3 US trials far, 1 unfortunately control arm. (There 4th, Johns Hopkins, decided cancel ivermectin arm reasons one researchers refused disclose.)

Dr. Marik made mistake claims vitamin C. happens. Source: history science. expect made *more* careful going limb again. remains credible enough Daniel Griffin collaborating write paper phases covid-19, according Dr. Griffin's comments TWIV.

So far, ivermectin shown promise prophylaxis covid19 (2.5 studies, 1 small, 1 yet formally reported). *might* effective eventual 50-70% effective vaccine. limited research reported date, ivermectin also promising covid19 therapy ([this retrospective study good example, [so ([and Dr. Marik's much better therapeutically Remdesivir, 1% cost Remdesivir. problem: off-patent, drug company going invest drug. needs backing federal government. great first step would EUA FDA -- unfortunately, FDA's rumored disregard trials done outside US/EU, probably happen Borody trial completed, supposed completed April 2021, [according ClinicalTrials hope Dr. Marik's endorsement ivermectin lead US researchers undertake good trials drug.

If Dr. Marik's endorsement sufficiently persuasive, 65 registered trials underway (a handful completed yet reported). results come in, perhaps persuade US researchers put ivermectin test.

Like particular area/state experiencing high growth cases there's much higher risk spreading thanksgiving. state experiencing high growth cases risk lower.

Personally I'd say base decision bad covid spreading state stick state guidance may be. Also another suggestion may hold thanksgiving outside makes feel safer.

Results
The median age 61.3 years (IQR 45‚àí69, 33.3 % female). Common EEG indications altered mental status (61.7 %), seizure-like events (31.2 %), cardiac arrest (3.5 %). Abnormal EEG findings (n = 543, 88.0 %) sub-classified three groups: (1) Background abnormalities: diffuse slowing (n = 423, 68.6 %), focal slowing (n = 105, 17.0 %), absent posterior dominant rhythm (n = 63, 10.2 %). (2) Periodic rhythmic EEG patterns: generalized periodic discharges (n = 35, 5.7 %), lateralized/multifocal periodic discharges (n = 24, 3.9 %), generalized rhythmic activity (n = 32, 5.2 %). (3) Epileptiform changes: focal (n = 35, 5.7 %), generalized (n = 27, 4.4 %), seizures/status epilepticus (n = 34, 5.5 %). Frontal EEG patterns comprised approximately third findings. studies utilized continuous EEG, 96.8 % (n = 243) 251 patients reported abnormalities compared 85.0 % (n = 311) patients undergo continuous EEG monitoring (œá2 = 22.8, p =&lt; 0.001).

Hence, patients received treatment regimens 48 hours hospitalization assigned control group, similar intention-to-treat analysis. mentioned before, excluded patients developed outcomes within 24 hours admission; therefore, included patients could developed outcome assigned group due grace period (48 hours). **Given patients could potentially assigned group, randomly distributed control treatment groups** avoid time-dependent bias due inappropriate exclusion treatment assignment (12).

It‚Äôs sad stems government simply helping businesses out. **Let start noting first comment polite, informative, backed multiple sources authoritative sources**, threw hissy fit response. Get yourself.

I give damn pissed are. actually medical professional rather fan-fiction anti-vaxxer*, start acting like professional claim rather spreading absolutely unfounded fear doubt medical products direct knowledge about.

Governments worldwide spending hundreds billions vaccines. Entire industries pharmacy researchers, medical researchers vaccine specialists slaving away **in thousands vaccine**. People spent entire life specialising safe design vaccines busting *THEIR* nuts whole fucking year try make *YOUR* life less shit. Hundreds top coronavirus researchers worldwide spent last 20 years life slaving away specifically trying design safe vaccines preparation outbreak virus **exactly like one** (i.e. specifically, SARS/MERS researchers).

Now could listen thousands people actually specialise safe design vaccines SARS type coronaviruses, whose reputations careers line, verifiable public identities, sued fuck - people spent entire adult lives careers preparing exactly moment problem - listen whether vaccine safe based absolutely *insane* amount data collected unbelievable expense. people stubbornly refused accept pressure endless politicians trying push forward soon - including pressure absolute top, President USA.

Or listen random guy reddit claims surgeon (who also vaccine specialist virus specialist), talking random guy hospital supposedly told him, (who also vaccine specialist virus specialist).

I condescend towards original post, ego trip. However, think deserve condescended towards, forming opinions manner have, ought training form opinions like fucking professional, unbelievably stupid, almost improbable (which leading think may yet another fan-fic writer anti-vaxx sympathies [1]).

Now, go **read papers pubmed** instead posting angry rants pricked ego, going post insights novel vaccines medical professional, factual grounds, literally one going make life-affecting decisions based random guy allegedly said random guy reddit, neither domain experts topic hand. Covid buffets. scary Midnight Man Requiring masks much different requiring testing that's currently available widespread basis. can't get test results back within 2 days areas country right now.

It's interesting think I'm republican I'm asking national strategy enhanced testing, things republicans expressly against. Covid over, silly; even White House said so. numbers fake. unregulated free market task.. I‚Äôll say I‚Äôm sure would‚Äôve problems nothing perfect.. ‚Äúpro government‚Äù coordinated effort democratically run federal government would‚Äôve fared much better! 

I‚Äôm sure lives would‚Äôve lost, probably third current tally money would‚Äôve given much needed people institutions bailing big corporations. Make America Cough shhhhhhhhhhhhhh one cares Florida numbers like every single day, they're refusing thing it! hoping recolonize us. Wtf? Let guess, El Paso votes mostly Dem? America: coronavirus worse problem ever.
Americans: Rona canceled let‚Äôs take masks. Best single source info would @jmcrookston Twitter feed. He‚Äôs tracking medical lit airborne transmission. remember human human transmission asymptomatic spread anecdotes evidence. 0.999, new case infects less one case average - long that's case, cases dwindling towards 0. R 0 means eradicated, least locally: new cases infect noone, new cases. prefer happen way connected. space, one hear cough. jobs essential. People pay bills feed others. Stupid fucks. Europe locked short time, opened bam, second wave fucking us. Austria instance amazing start, second wave actually problems guess what, opening stupid severe lockdown. I‚Äôm real tired reading press releases vaccine manufacturers. even true best case scenario. survival rate 97%, meaning average 1 30 chance dying. Pick country, google corona statics calculate number deaths/(number deaths plus number recovered). That's real risk dying.  
In Australia example never got anywhere close overburdening healthcare system, locked down, universal healthcare, massive testing blitzes (so numbers pretty reliable) death rate 3.4%. 
Globally 3.7%. Games without fans generate nothing virus vectors local area fans show anyway there's party atmosphere. Stop citing statistics using critical thinking, trust science. exit Fauci's lips true. Fuck centrist one, dude, two uh yes dude. Shaking hands gross, know someone prior it. jackass standing less 2 feet checkout line, coughing else. Fuck that. may want obviously people agree me. disgusting normal thing. think it‚Äôs weird performatively brag supposed social life internet. Everyone friends. It‚Äôs something especially proud of. Thanks explanation. couple questions that‚Äôs okay?

So, understand, know coronaviruses immunity generally lasts 12-24 months. likely timeline covid well? studies saying 7-8 months imply perhaps covid immunity bit shorter coronaviruses? 

Also- could super wrong thought common cold somewhat seasonal...year round peaks winter? known covid well? suppose don‚Äôt know seasonal means seasonal lifestyle changes winter, something else inherent within virus/its natural environment thrive better winter. Maybe both? people wanted educated career left small rural communities went college urban area created brain drain, resulting a. ..less science believing rural populace. well majority immediate family (including three members mid 80s) gotten it. hospitalizations, asymptomatic cold young moderate flu-like illness old. looked right. bad. I'm still idea declare war New Zealand immediately surrender. think might make idk said 2000 ICU beds occupied 7 days. said thing Monkey pee you. Yeah, fuck wanting show courtesy I'm showing wearing mask. hope lost told people mask protect you, protects others. That's selfish assholes needed hear. Billions dollars 20 million doses. got finessed big time. USA guy Scott Atlas President loves he‚Äôs going around telling everyone deliberately infect achieve herd immunity. Belongs gulag.

Free speech interesting concept - free speech malicious lies infectious disease cause real people die - sort belong prison, don‚Äôt you? know feel, remind lot us care. Regardless feel see, still aren‚Äôt alone. Absolutely. last quite years. explain determine spread mostly asymptomatic population daily tested?

I remember summer 70-80% cases asymptomatic. speak population even younger flew vacation. Well you‚Äôve accurately summarised likely true. 
The UK saying vaccine may approved won‚Äôt available majority public months, ever. German media referring majority public get quite easy match UK media. 1. take entire family go grocery Christmas shopping. 

2. We've local Republicans holding superspreader events counties election time slew government positions 

3. election year democrats/having butter Federal government ppe &amp; unemployment funding/his hopes reelection next cycle/hopes run president, made precarious Democrat governor put teeth consistent enforcement. man great leader. Well deserved rest day say least. Murdoch's lackies would've field day though. kind purple sorcery this? possible get infected injection standard ways?

He got tested first time false positives extremely rare, test depends replicating genetic material virus virus. advance Oh able buy big hat from? S.

There‚Äôs world podunk town. üëç hate defend us certainly go correctly... sure see differences country like United States relatively tiny isolated Island countries like New Zealand Japan. 

Aside sheer size, population economy global scale, US pretty much travel hub trade hub entire world. I'm ohio. shut pretty early given official company letter show cops telling I'm allowed I'm essential (which true, safety assessment testing animals anything new pesticide cancer drugs). state reopened talk 'hero pay' started tossed around, asked managers possibility. told us arent essential paper saying essential supposed thrown away.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* resources. Germany 1 -1.2 mn tests mn per week. Labs capacity. Bottleneck reagents, materials delivered lab diagnostic companies like Roche. Also personnel limiting factor. EU craving tests everybody rising outbreaks. guess lot materials production reagents imported asia Western countries cannot produce quantity. Lab state produced false positives used non-fitting reagent, couldnt get hands right one. spring even wadded plastic sticks swabs.

Western CDCs want pooled testing reasons dont get. favour antigen tests, CCDC obviously doesnt want. prove that? reopening, state never closed! i'll probably take years fully study effects vaccine give young, healthy people. Imagine herd mentality following recommendations. would success story. Instead shitting messenger try reading message? Everything says totally reasonable rational. It‚Äôs fault want stick fingers ears. mean, start? Like pandemic? would see playing out?

we pretty substantial lockdowns across country. mean would stayed back come early?

If latter, would virus today? still vaccine take. Definitely numbers would lower, get wrong, would locked late March April least November. glad person making decisions weighing outcomes things like this... also selfishly glad able work span months. 

Or saying something else? Space Force lol. He's fucking moron. Guys need Moon Patrol too. Badly. strongly. 
Say sometime blows satellite something (I can't think crime would fighting ""space""), gonna jump rocket go chase bad guys? Seriously wtf role 2018 7,800 people died every single day, many infectious otherwise preventable disease. national display grief them? he's *not* saying all.

They're working **anyway**!!

He's giving money required, help lives. \*checks notes\* six months late. Gothenburg resident here. Done PCR antibody test last month. rate Thanksgiving going devastating Uhh...half voting population would rather see people get sick die virus insufficient/no healthcare.

‚ÄúGenerous‚Äù isn‚Äôt first adjective I‚Äôd use describe Americans. dude, italian pm knowa chances elected. He's worried government might fall. first time Look us rounding corner exception masks mandate lower limit gatherings there‚Äôs whole lot difference Denmark, live, Sweden. Limit gathering really don‚Äôt feel affects much. still dinner friends‚Äô. better half still goes arts class (with mask). recommend social bubbles 10. counting 7 people regularly see, better half 11 (so course tease ask going cut out, worst best friend). Life different, it‚Äôs doable. don‚Äôt feel overly restricted. it‚Äôs easier comply. 

My biggest pet peeve going grocery store/public transportation realizing forgot bring masks. either go back home buy new ones. Basically stores year.

They're basically switching online deals month long stuff.  equally likely lower initial viral load results time needed immune system react.

A lower (but still significant) initial exposure means time immune system react viral load increases critical level. can't grocery stores strictly curbside/pick up, ship?

Don't internet? Show store store hands preprinted list groceries, similar see Chinese Take Menu, drop off, grocery store calls/texts you. 

I'm sick people bringing entire vectors damn disease, damn families Wallyworld problems among adults socialising, new PHW data suggested schools ""not seeing extensive transmission"".

Compare schools university halls residence, spread like wildfire amongst uni students cases per 100,000 places). Schools barely touched comparison, neither primary secondary round corner single case. Dude hear? Trump defeated covid. USA looking 100,000 confirmed cases today. 6.3% tests came back positive, let's optimistically assume one four cases getting captured. say real number infections today around 400,000. 

400,000 cases fatality rate 0.67% 2680 deaths. 

We even hit November yet. good chance 3000 death per day month now, even hospital resources get overloaded, pretty big if. product future class action lawsuit written lol Big money plus DeSantis

Don‚Äôt shoot messenger btw Water wet fuck friday reporting

all homies hate friday reporting gonna long winter...

just checked Belgium basically number 1 2 (if exclude tiny ass San Marino) deaths per 1 million people. run ventilator Sounds right  Makes easy figure would‚Äôve Nazi earlier time. fucking insane!? picked newspaper, watched news reports last weeks? Maybe land borders define transmission happens world major tourism happening flights? maybe. won‚Äôt long won‚Äôt able find air purifier store Internet site world. it‚Äôs important buy She‚Äôs got lot blood hands. Hard imagine... also add - family friend's daughter working vaccine (moderna maybe?) long time didnt think would happen 2022 late summer, helps optimism also. There's always chance, he's pictured almost everyday visiting business firms photo opportunities, without wearing mask social distancing saves one life. new normal worth it? New York Times best I've seen. also family Wisconsin using track state everyone thinks _they_ arnt risk, _you_ idea every state needed make cdc hold water. paid federal cdc absolutely allowed job. 

If think national response pandemic cross border right, logical conclusion there's need nation all. Demonstrate life joy, full bitterness might get jealous enough wonder achieve it. Deaths: +199

that equivalent 1,090 deaths US. dying similar rate Americans currently  know quite people got it. tough survived it, them.

Feel free let know account. We're gonna gold medal something dammit!  No. time there‚Äôs vaccine, death rate plummet acceptable level normallife resume emotional symptoms. stop class mobility. Wealthy people predominantly pay income tax, instead mostly pay capital gains much forgiving gameable. One easy enforcement schools. school opening fine , first month pretty normal. glad high shcool aged child could get needed college. child said teachers getting tired masks cleaning. teachers child enforce masks class wear mask themselves. child says teacher says wear mask, students do, teacher says care , some, students take off. Easy get principal coach someone walk check classrooms make sure on? podcast really freaked out. terrified. ""rounding corner"" ""almost nothing"" looks like? Cause think ""rounding corner"" looks like... know people wont listen second national lockdown comes play? leadership actions ridiculous government embarrassed confused general public, point sort future direction laughed away. good news: New York City takes COVID seriously many places country. stores occupancy limits wont let people masks on. people wear masks (anecdotally speaking). hit hard early lost lot people, know bad is.

The...less good news: might culture shock probably adjust. Depending live, may loud. would recommend white noise machine, bothers you. COVID, things less crowded, going probably learn go flow (stay right, keep walking, get anyone's way). dont chit-chat strangers here, either, outside settings like bars (which mostly closed now). different way existing public: everyone crowded learn give people space privacy even together.

Look, there's pluses minuses. love times Ive South chat uber drivers. downside? People tend nosy judgmental (imo). NYC people open (a lot people flat crazy, dont go around making eye contact strangers especially public transit), people also mind business wont get unless youre bothering them.

With COVID winter, want inside lot anyway...I recommend getting exercise bike can. We're together. Good luck! Nah, used religious fundamentalists. best vocal minority. exactly racist conclude that, US, white people would represented niche subculture based around gun ownership, flag waving bible. 

And white people come sorts flavors. Ah. motto got vibe encouragement get food go. late Dr. McScarfy Pay wallüòû side wishes thought way. that‚Äôs whole United States, we‚Äôre talking Florida, different curve. look state state, see goes down. Everyone different phase governor taking different stance, virus ‚Äúmoving‚Äù around waves. wonder Chicago death Covid Gun violence near future Downvoting CDC. *Shameful.* Ummmm what's going here? Shitty corner New Zealand real leadership. government made headlines taking ""all together"" time (and STICKING THAT), giving pay cut etc. 

The UK government voted pay rise allowed MPs advisors break rules impunity. They've talked us like idiots, denied food hungry kids, told us go eat (with financial incentive) blamed us spreading covid, told people self isolate without providing financial protection so. much favour strong measures quell virus win little normalcy back, fear UK government destroyed much little credibility left prior fuck ups crises garner sort mass compliance. highest infection rate pandemic. nothing_stops_this_train.gif know friends say ‚Äúyou white people sure crazy.‚Äù Good. pandemic excuse break laws. governor says can't lockdown, means can't lockdown. End story. actually accuse anything. merely assumed.

ETA:

I described someone fictitious wished Swedish people dead thought Tegnell public enemy 1.

So thought would obvious describing right? No. special üòâ People 50/50 using masks, social distancing places like Old Port non-existent, cold dining outdoors either moved inside tents heaters (which essentially thing). Christian, two objects send quite conflicting message. Jesus said ""love enemy"" ""shoot enemy"", group people hoping would overthrow superpower occupying nation. Also cured AIDS fucking frog, Broadway musicals believed language rules prevents lot writing English government.  coworker found brother law tested positive asked BIL wanted hang him. told tested positive corona coworker said, ‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôm trying get it. heard makes d‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ bigger.‚Äù

His wife absolutely terrified, holed basement newborn daughter. heard someone *might* make dick bigger, he‚Äôs trying catch purpose. fuck. Man, posts I'm seeing Facebook friends getting ready party Halloween going get really fucking bad. tough, like isolating - somebody fire break. 

Its getting point like damaged ship containment system - worst happen sometimes you‚Äôre going close bulkhead keep crisis/damage/contamination getting further, may mean good people can‚Äôt manage get time get locked wrong side. needs many sometimes outweigh needs few... trolly problem philosophy steroids. *sucks* many levels...

But time feels like enabling... (potentially) close borders, without means escape turn fight stop Branch Covidians. barriers go small enough level Brand Covidians deal mess made everybody else blocked off. reason shunning effective method punishment. 

The time good answers gone... we‚Äôre trying navigate way get people one piece possible - based facts gather varying margins error. :/  OMg never seen picture pander level. Literally linked article ruling lockdown unconstitutional. misinformation. Keep going, stereotype brilliant county specific data positivity rate? family Wisconsin would like keep track. trends site, go [this COVID Tracking Project, provides data, find hospitalizations chart. change range past 90 days full range see back beginning. Earlier peaks around 59K hospitalized, currently 47K.

I believe there's particular state interested finding metrics on, find going historical data links. might make chart case, though. Uh, speak yourself. Tons Europeans want fly US still bans entering. Idk man. Someone doesn‚Äôt tell everyone get pub spread virus shut every thing month later. man incompetent won‚Äôt last longer, even people lose jobs 2-3 months lockdown wish side thought way delusions skyrocketing high think Belgium one countries reported numbers accurate, even overestimated. Nah thing stop pandemic vaccine. Thinking anything else end (short draconian China style response people getting welded home island like Australia) foolish. Nothing US change long virus keep going around, absolutely nothing. Yeah remember bible followers beheading people churches.

Stop embarssing yourself. I'm talking fact accuse wishing swedish people die.

You really banned accusations like that. think shopping surge already (at least southern part state). items already (won't mention want hoarders hear food non-food) last night tried go target grocery store lines 15 deep. Funny go omg look deaths 9/11 people lose minds, insane numbers people lose minds matter...yikes It‚Äôs typical much UK attitude - looking people things blame, rather themselves. Ironically attitude helped get today. relatable content reddit. call little bit though. know lot infections happen (indirectly) schools, keeping kids away 2 weeks help slowing virus keeping hospitals operational hope. Massive expansion state solve issues without discussing automation power grab. Thank you‚Äôre doing! Stop trying make ‚Äúthe new normal‚Äù happen. It‚Äôs gonna happen. want lives back we‚Äôre going live weird, dystopian life longer absolutely to. Christian someone needs tell violence Christianity mix. We're love (put another's wellbeing own) enemies, shoot them. Remember Jesus telling group people who's nation occupied foreign superpower believe host gods. ‚ÄúMasks perhaps important component personal protective equipment (PPE) needed fight pandemic,‚Äù said Northwestern‚Äôs Jiaxing Huang, led study. ‚ÄúWe quickly realized mask protects person wearing it, much importantly, protects others exposed droplets (and germs) released wearer. Donald: ‚Äúno lockdown‚Äù would replace him?  Western Oregon 40 straight days rain season . vitamin level super low . hope fellow Oregonians get checked Tomorrow lame interpretation conversation thread lol Nah. Trump found bigger brownnoser Birx, throwing fit. people easily shocked practically constantly live state slightly elevated stress, this. Long period worrying, ocd germs, masks hand cleaning, money problems etc. leads PTSD symptoms. Even sleep deprivation, causes waking night. person tests positive corona...which would've likely gone without problems...and voila PTSD deepens even diagnosis. Muscle fatigue ensues, brain fog...and get marked ""long term covid"".

This whole thing fast becoming mental healthcare crisis, constant media bombardment mismanagement. Cheaper, yes. much less profitable  - New cases: 19,312
- Positivity rate: 7.4% est. (+0.4)
- hospital: 8,707 (+586)
- ICU: 1,858 (+158)
- New deaths: 87

(Germany 84 million people btw) Highest daily total country except single day India, 4x population. good. I'm sure we'll smash India's number next day two way things going. Yup. Won‚Äôt long US averaging 100k cases daily.

Absolutely horrific. Hey, thanks sharing! company this? Also immune related chronic illness issues? I'm glad hear that, tackling virus needs full comprehensive effort, half arsed attempts even scientific advisors said work first place... Great point, certainly speciality stores yelling closed bigger store could sell things. creates lot pushback several months lockdown, idea whatever started... well, really define what‚Äôs important.

Repairing decent pair work boots? May required go work essential job, might important winter. something new kids 4 weeks? essential living rather big deal getting people buy staying home. Fixing water pipe hot water isn‚Äôt taking hour warm up. Again, truly required rather important (and good world).

Perhaps better approach would limiting store sell relevant expected duration. You‚Äôll fine without necklace weeks sure.

Last, certainly least, it‚Äôs important online orders delivered not. so, well goes local. wear mask take risks feel appropriate age group/physical condition (27 year old man good shape underlying conditions). take responsibility health. get tested COVID twice week every single week school yet test positive even despite going gym, etc., almost every day. cops aren‚Äôt like though...the media focuses psycho ones.. plenty ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù US license practice medicine revoked. 
This fuck top list. MAKE. 

YOUR.

OWN.

DAMN. 

FOOD. wonder life going sat reddit hoping Swedish people would die proove middling Swedish bureaucrat appointed public enemy 1, wrong prediction made months ago.

You clearly implied hoped Swedish people would die.

This ok opinion.

Edit: I've reported btw. Let's see happens okay accuse others wish death upon countries. lot heart Took long enough...

She chosen Pence she‚Äôs die hard Christian. Jesus telling keep quiet Trump told press looking injecting patients bleach?  simply acceptable answer. also assumes mutates get again. Additionally need work treatments hard vaccine. 99.99% people could recover would able act differently. 

I think main reason restrictions buy time vaccines available. vaccines don‚Äôt work doing? Copy link archive.is Today. Already 98k 97,110 new cases 957 new deaths also October 30th. can't help feel spiraling control anything could happen now. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll topped within week ;(  Sorry bro, get play ""what people's livelihoods"" well ""200,000 deaths acceptable margin error"" cards argument. Nice try though. No. Oh I'll bite. Let's say government let everyone manage covid prevention ""sovereign citizens"" take responsiblity themselves. measures taking bit? trusted consider people? Tell us household taking public health autonomy seriously. color law currently exists? reality yeah reflected til likely Tuesday ran publicity stunt. REALLY obvious look policy goals.

Also shy saying exactly wanted, codified desire sleep several teenage girls religion. think megalomania would exception? 

Also he's obviously megalomaniac ran president? true everyone ever ran president? 

He's guy also made military commanded go home thought time war opponents, guy repeatedly showed court cases him, give context Brigham Young became leader often declared he'd never pay lawyers free pay mind court summons opening coat reveal pistols regularly wore. 

Also there's plethora secular historians agree clearly believed taught, never made rich, never helped financially, stop nearly killed multiple times, tar feathered mob burned house murdered infant child. 

If scam badly executed plan, mostly causes harm eventually got killed mob blackface broke jail held in. 

What con artist. Edgy Winter coming.... 

Its going get worse gets better. Sadly feel like tip ice berg compared see 2-3 weeks thanksgiving Anyone praising NK based fan fiction - there's data whatsoever coming country, like trying estimate COVID cases Wakanda. 

And besides, NK benefits already highly isolated - country really major contact China, China controls pandemic borders, NK would huge beneficiary Lol either way he's still president January fuck taking Belgium federal state. consists 2 semi-autonomuous regions 3 language communities. 6 governments municipal, regional, federal European elections. Sometimes coincide, sometimes depending length terms.

Part things complex rooted long lasting tensions conflict language communities grounds emergence byzantine governance administrative structures

This turns Belgian politics 4D chess.

Already pandemic, Belgium suffered deep, painful formation new federal government since 2019 elections. took 500 days finally appoint government prime minister, came power 4 weeks ago. then, minority government managed crisis extended powers constitutional kung fu. Even Spring last year, politics held little credit among population.

The net result country many captains, lacking flexibility swiftly deal sudden crisis. clearly shows disparate measures taken various levels jurisdictions. Lacking clear message clear rules, people become tired, angry resentful accordion like approach rules impact daily life.

So, that's one big reason here. historic social economic explanations also importance. political side part reported on. that's hope clarify. got went bad time too, since fully open cases rose level less open. That's I'm saying. getting colder place warmer weather helps, looks like colder weather worse affect opened states. fix we‚Äôll Venezuela something something communism yet places like Hawaii Florida lot sunshine still high counts... state already surpassed voter turnout 2016 early voting. brave virus vote now. Sounds cynical not. virus beast can't tamed. need figure what's causing pneumonias.  Halloween, voting, plus Thanksgiving? wouldn‚Äôt surprised 200k Chicago.  average new case every 0.85 seconds. Absolutely insane quite difficult mind comprehend Well acknowledge may happening. it‚Äôs maybe. I‚Äôve getting takeout pretty much everyday last six months. minimize risks going mostly drive thrus masking even drive thru. 

Also wear N95 mask going inside restaurants use hand sanitizer coming back car. wipe food packaging home isopropyl alcohol wash hands multiple times process finally consuming food. 

Yes dislike cooking Much lol. 

What think... safe keep up, risky? telling won‚Äôt disappear November 4th? /s Melbourne city five million people, live? Lmfao no. still federal democratic republic. want dictator, go China. Congress might able things commerce powers, even Congress probably couldn‚Äôt legally anything would extreme enough satisfy people boners China-style lockdowns here. Joe already said multiple times doesn‚Äôt believe national lockdown solution supported science also said wouldn‚Äôt constitutional authority lock country like even wanted to. I've reading quite lot history lately. things I've learned - intelligence, tyranny stupidity timeless. build studies build upon. Politicians, CEO's,... vile they've ever been. phones make stupid, make stupid visible louder. 100% right.

First months would marvel 1200 cases day.. US popping 90k day people shrug shoulders. Thats 1 mil every 10 days rate Time lapse map case rates

Second wave chart Meanwhile White House listed ending covid 19 pandemic accomplishment. It‚Äôs even close over. I'm acttually curious even allowed say this.

I'm president again, said it, true. That's fear for. we'll probably get someone ""America's Frontline Doctors"" take place. thought scary. Feel like headline everyday lately. Sigh That‚Äôs probably why. Midwest Coke like 50% meth. fact Trump president unrelated intelligence culture problem mentioned. like culmination. I‚Äôll handing candy tomorrow friends. We‚Äôll masks tell kids get candy bowl pick two each. Cancelling halloween ridiculous overreach.  SF bay area we've seen San Francisco hollow massive real estate boom suburbs. Young people moved SF urban amenities job offerings, especially tech. techies work anywhere urban amenities shut indefinitely, there's point continuing pay absurd rent live shoebox. Time tell reverse entirely restrictions lifted.

But no, going socially distance forever. That's ridiculous. government want impose lockdown. Therefore gradually increased restrictions throughout October hope full lockdown could averted. work course therefore back spring. definitely hoping enough people paying attention think getting cruise ship good idea. kind area Utah think good idea.

I trade school, internships hands learning this. schools opened 3 months ago .They high school students going care centers nursing homes work study internships. high school students leave high school lunch goes work nursing home. area nursing home outbreaks school year started 8 outbreaks. believe since visitors allowed in(like neighbor allowed see 80 year old mom since March), sudden addition high school students part cause 8 outbreaks sadly deaths. turned focus finding Bid Laden. latest intelligence reports say capture death Antifa conspiracy Mostly work schools according state health agency. Numbers people partying high people think (not saying nonexistent course). guys Halloween plans?  /r/woooosh Yeah good luck Rona damn stupid possibly be..  sure he's sworn in. ramming crises hour now. 1,000 dead Americans yesterday. What‚Äôs big deal (according Jr.)? really. extremely small minority amplified Murdoch media. Mississippi bad... masks worn. 

Its bad GRU Retarded comment without use brain Yeah, cause definitely never happened crusades.

Read history book, better yet, BIBLE. Violent shit, man. hope sarcastic. Rounding corner... road still leads Absolutely fucking not. Holy shit!! may went something like virus never going eradicated. flu clue. Russian flu 1890 closer clue. true case count pandemic likely much higher ""confirmed"". People panic mode previous historical data indicate going around years. Plus, many people going trust early vaccines?? said US 100 cases saw painting walls, million+ deaths vary least. 
^^^^And ^^^^got ^^^^downvoted ^^^^to ^^^^hell 
The prognosis seems hold. show picture person breathing air chemical modulation layer. guarantee mask comes cancer warning California Idaho also second highest positivity rate...

Curious. Speak yourself. I'm certainly following rules, family.   Vanilla ISIS  IDK. Maybe came family gatherings end summer holidaymakers going back home work two weeks meeting new people daily eating less crowded restaurants. case several weeks back normal, meeting usual contacts without nightlife maybe, maybe, infections could slow bit. 
But again, hope theory. Second wave come 50 years dies she'll able bake pie without oven. Omg coke cure covid. I'll right back..... Let's absolutely reform system also providing standard living survival. Unpopular(?) Opinion: nobody trying make profit basic needs human survival. Housing, especially, ought something handle society general; which, importantly, say housing involve particular luxuries, roof head protection elements something denied inherit it, build yourself, find work enough terrible economy afford whatever around. way housing market currently works never really set well me, considering set countless people streets little-to-no fault own, maybe sit poorly people. imagine 200-350k cases/day countries Europe equivalent right now. stopping Covid unless go full lock happen. Goddamnit hate website, asshats attack gun? carry cause raped people worthless goddamn trash, fuck you. take step back look bigger picture. two differences religious extremist groups, Christian extremist groups.

1. god believe in
2. ruin lives people agree them. ~~~~ proposing people stop selfish?

Okay good luck one. political solution. human foundational problem. 100% correct. there's asymptomatic presymptomatic spread. contact tracing really snuff. There's way gym people one source spreading this. Calling troll make troll. refusal answer questions makes clear lying incapable backing position. 

What disingenuous using deaths per capita?

Provide proof lie mortality rate US lower official number. agree Corbyn made many mistakes particularly charismatic. However, narrative excuse reference absolutely horrible treatment received vast majority British media. fact, regardless whether like guy not. tell Labour's bad results stemmed primarily Corbyn factors - personally wager side note since say Labour voter. think Corbyn's recent suspension party justified not?

I never bought 'Corbyn anti-Semite' thing personally, think bit much. miss personally although MP borough.

I also think treated poorly media precisely poor candidate unelectable unpalatable much populace. Charisma also helps win media like not, matters. lot sympathy Corbyn's media treatment personally think Labour set back years sticking long never viable PM candidate. I'd much rather voted even Miliband personally, I'm fairly centrist. Covid-19 adept capitalizing weakness stupidity. Trump's lockdowns going hoot! Even change beliefs many cases. news last week Kansas nursing home 62 residents infected Covid 10 died. buddy lives close happened said general opinion people area media trying make look bad exercising freedoms. 

There's still people area wearing masks, likely knew least one people died small town.

'They would died year anyway pre-existing conditions.' lot people saying. 

I'm moving fuck KS soon save enough. I'll prob stuck another year least :( think CDC can't math?  Maybe people make idaho bad die well /s I'm getting closer closer sitting back couch eating popcorn letting anti-mask motherfuckers run around dying. I'm honestly getting ok quickly.

The way look is, even need fight stupidity, nature will. take you, it'll take kids, parents, friends family, point along lines, look mirror think comment say, ""Damn, fucking stupid listened goddamned scientists."" Maybe 100K Friday October 30th. He's never coming close EA/Battlefront post. live Melbourne, Australia. came 7 months lockdown, 4 months strict (Curfew, mask mandate, allowed outside 5km radius). realised first winter never got sick through. I'm sorry going this, people need take seriously. 900 people died state (Melbourne population 4.5million). IDK. That's need studies like quantify effects COVID entire system. Everything essential minimum wage (or lower!). luxuries pay more. Unfortunate died Covid able vote... money gone. borrowed central banks point. ü§£ may said this, may said it

I may gotten tested maybe didn't

The pandemic may happening isnt

There may racists maybe isnt

I may benefit support racists maybe dont That's true, upvoted comments usually good. However really amplifies echo chamber problem imo, point reddit (or least default subs) sound like one person. Positivity rates fall testing, assuming consistent rate spread. Yeah, understand hate folks second house, extra rooms, whatever choose rent out. landlord issue giant corporations scooping massive quantities property screwing millions people. born raised midwestern United States. Picture left strong sense ‚ÄúWhat Fuck?!?!?!!‚Äù care human rights, care individual freedoms. Remember whole thing American exceptionalism? That‚Äôs supposed mean countries aspire enlightened treat citizens allies best.

Not let people die result brutal policing disease containable making small sacrifices. wonder many cases traced back gyms. think I've heard any, although mean happening gyms hold zero risk.

I'm pretty much hearing transmission parties, schools, school social events, weddings, churches, workplaces, bars/restaurants.

Point being, even gyms hold theoretically higher likelihood transmission, really seeing current restrictions, what's problem?  rent people pandemic proof jobs super high credit scores good. say great renter even lost job id find anyway make money least give rent. know times hard people really can't pay. However people still money left pay lights food.. try give rent... ugggghh give rest us bad name. need to, though. He's broadcasting plan loud clear months - Tweets, rallies, interviews, standing White House lawn yelling clouds Testing deflates positivity rate increases accuracy. Absurdly high positivity rates usually mean testing sickest people. I've looked comment history. definitely worth time. last message reply you. horrible person like everyone else keeps telling you. Grow up. woman holding bible gun



and none things

will anything stop covid-19 mhm, course. guess dems scared coming conservatives decided never worth anything eh? House control last 40 years: Republicans 20 years, Dems 20 years. Senate control: Republicans 22, Dems 18. know you, call ""dominating"" would call pretty damn please, enlighten conservatives supposedly able undo liberal policies, also make things worse. appears likely scenario liberal branch far fractured get anything done despite nearly identical time majorities 3 branches.

The ""one side bad"" argument really fun side power. dem president back in, blame sweeping policies continue fail gain traction? that‚Äôs trump‚Äôs pandemic team top things!! 

What‚Äôs that? He..he what? that? Oh. Oh my. Well, certainly wasn‚Äôt good idea. 

So, big deal, reassembled team, right? definitely depends subreddit talking though, political subs really hard read. Norway Denmark lock down. approach similar different Sweden's.

And stop staring covid death toll look age-adjusted overall mortality compare 5 10 year average, clear measures nordic countries saved many lives, approximately none all.

The thing protect hospitals overrun peaks, nordic countries avoided that. Trump symptom much larger, deeper disease. picture unironic version ""How world sees Americans"" meme. Big dumb truck, Bible, gun, American flag, sound bite eagle freedom screeching back mind. may may breathing graphic super misleading. helpful tell people struggling pain grateful different type pain. sucks, either way. People depressed often also struggling survive. live Idaho. regional health district voted end mask mandate county even moved county ""orange"" ""red"", city council voted 4-2 enact city-wide mask mandate place. online movement recall 4 councilmembers voted yes. surrounded morons. Tegnell still think good idea raise crowd size limit 50 300 November 1.

But mess regions restrictions recommendations.

Linkoping closes everything legally close according Aftonbladet.

My region Varmland press conference put recommendations restrictions. sure yet since neither lokal press, TV region streaming press conference. Garnish wages, send prison, let sweet sweet penalties pile up, etc. They'll get pound flesh. There's probably something theory. We've trained hate side love side. 

Now leaked every part lives, especially politics. hope turn around, know path going look like. New York unique - far worst one worst cities earth terms COVID fatalities short amount time.

Now take place like Cedar Rapids, IA Colorado Springs. Could allowed people safely access regular doctor. Ironic. agree thematically Torah New Testament's divergent views state sanctioned violence, but...

Christianity incredibly aggressive militant religion. Probably second consistently successfully aggressive faith history. 

For unknown reason, clear pacifism Jesus ignored people called selves Christians, generally quite comfortable ""just war"" theories, even simple cultural enjoyment violence like woman. I'm pointing Bernie is, he's wannabe socialist.

I masters degree polisci, actually. You? extrovert fine. issue whether extrovert introvert. emotionally maturity flexible coping mechanisms. well enjoy michbas enjoy socializing. self-worth need validated others. need putting risk feeling can't grasp fact Covid care emotions, emotional well being, cares getting lungs. prefer healthy social, make due. all, lucky leave house bit also feeling miserable it. Definitely. ""Takeout"" alone never going make lost revenue idea spending $40 meal quite alluring anymore (1) lose atmosphere, (2) eat semi cold house. people would opt make something fresh point. Part ordering restaurant restaurant itself, that's built price pay. 

Sure, community fundraisers/encourage ordering support, that's going go far. situation, really, really sucks. that's cOmMuNiSm!

*sigh* It‚Äôs ok. worries. People scream ‚Äútroll‚Äù first instance someone questioning anything. I‚Äôm offended slightest. ask questions, it‚Äôs learn. 

I really appreciate taking time link article chat me. 

My political leanings go far feel like ‚Äúfor people‚Äù got lost somewhere along way. Imo, system needs serious overhaul. 

I always stop wonder people talk politics one talks favorite football team. Blind support things ‚Äújust because‚Äù ‚Äúbecause always have‚Äù leads one better things. 

American media leanings based watch, don‚Äôt watch much tv like asking people questions. 

Some people get angry, don‚Äôt give time day, others give articles read- regardless enjoy learning it‚Äôs worth shot. Thank time again. New u/T0rrent01 alt? Nice someone US totally insane. Somehow we've reached point 20-30% population ignore objective reality vote self-interest wave gun Bible front them, almost like hypnotist's cheap parlor trick. Never mind fact Bible gun go together - pick Bible read time Evangelical Christians, raised Jewish I'm atheist even took time read book, got lot nice stuff kindness forgiveness nothing shooting people disagree it. Never mind fact political party uses kind imagery responsible deaths Americans (and damage society infrastructure) last countries went war combined.

As someone lives extremely liberal urban area pretty liberal state (guess what, hell hole, good public schools, lots jobs, tap water poisonous, people come world work live here) I'm sick tax dollars subsidizing states routinely shoot foot instead improving themselves. suppose real solution increased access better education electorate informed actually think themselves, course conservatives would never that. shit started Reagan (and works even that) seems accelerating last 20 years. Extremely frustrating. Yeah come November 4th everyone hospital stand walk they're really sick. everyone died ummm... Go away!.... Batin last major pandemic hundred years ago 

Don't know definition 'major' swine flu killed 550,000 people

HIV-AIDS killed 40 million. Meh. Technically, wrong. using logic 3 year old make sure right. know stupidly obvious they're taking sides one ever say ""you wrong."" never admit wrong. Christian Taliban saw photo thought WTF? 

Because sane person poses phot gun top Bible?

No one. one who‚Äôs sane.

Fraudulent elections I'm saying I'm immunologist defer them. Calm down. North Dakota's yesterday's increase 1,223 cases equivalent 532,239 daily cases US.

Practically everyone Americas Europe completely fucking western world setting new records every day right now. Pointing either side ocean saying ""they're much worse are"" incredibly stupid short-sighted, *in directions*. That's pointless schadenfreude ignoring house much fire. conspiracy, real?

Yes, definitely. lots conspiracies everyone going die people lying severity early stages. replaced conspiracies completely harmless vaccine kind globalist plot.

So, different. Wait, election! general, ""boosting immune system"" something anyone want do. immune system something half-asses bare minimum keep alive. Immune systems constantly balanced knife edge catching dangerous things overly aggressive destroying healthy tissue. know call immune system that's little aggressive side? autoimmune disorder.
You want push immune system active. want provide materials information needs identify pathogens accurately remove them. means eating healthy diet contains essential vitamins minerals, getting vaccinated properly. vaccine comes covid-19 (and shown safe effective) definitely getting vaccine required boosters (if ends requirement). getting harder harder feel bad people. actually exact concept. Building immunity small exposure. That's theory discussed. think big thing remember masks protect indoors confined spaces people prolonged periods time. group masked people sitting room together 8 hours someone shedding virus still high chance becoming infected. Masks short bouts contact limit much infected person spread. may also help limiting amount virus person exposed potentially giving milder disease course. much close proximity extended periods time. People need remember feel overly protected situations really aren't. want religion politics, want non-christian religions politics. They're exactly Taliban, Al Qaeda ISIS except different book hands. usual containment strategies fail, sabotaged corrupt incompetent US government? even, usual containment strategies even attempted hubris so? EU isn‚Äôt country country set regulations. Covid policies per country vary greatly. See: Sweden Yes, look interfered public health organizations pandemic, expects loyalty sees subordinates that‚Äôs US government works misleading part X beds handle critical care CV patients March, today beds handle patients nothing different all.  

What highlighting needs patients shifted would rather publish ICU capacity prior standard care. would lead us wrong conclusions. 

Staffed beds sufficient care workers focus here. didn‚Äôt think anyone world would dumb enough run ‚Äúwhat nothing see happens‚Äù test coronavirus americans, fuck it! Haven‚Äôt run Karma yet? lol omg first comment morning feels. must gone Ronald McDonald University. Graduated Cum Laude tho. Houston Texas, seems like everyone wearing mask. least hop day Literally EXACT Taliban, Al Qaeda. Entrepreneurs generally add value networth society. case builders house added value. person bought used rent people's living wage add zero value. 

Both capitalist Marxist economists explain better me. I'm blaming tho. dog eat dog world nasty things sometimes. system.of owning people's houses charging sometimes half salaries they'll never get opportunity get house pretty crooked claiming seeing double hospitalizations.

I asked tracking info none. asked would even metric using considering severity might affect immunity, respond.

If give quoted guy, clearly enough confidently say bunch double hospitalizations even lot reinfections. test isn‚Äôt going accurate day exposure. need wait least 5 days accurate result take PCR test rapid test accurate results. silly. would immediately challenged court dozen states. 

&amp;#x200B;

The simple truth federal government authority Joe Biden already stated such. put pressure governors can't himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Nor we. That's US works pretending is, shows vast misunderstanding federalism legislative process. France perfect example never going away without vaccine. Unlike US, actually locked hard drove case count really low.

And exploded. Normalized population, almost 3x many cases Parisians already first lockdown. people happy... actually ideals. Literally everything spite left ""faggy"" whatever. thing happened August Paris closed everyone went vacation. Really interested complete guesstimate time frames. time election day! Great job everyone!

We banded together make banding together harder dangerous! Trials teens kids vaccine safety, may well much problem. Efficiency though, really clue far. candidates waiting first interim analyses. Pfizer need 32 cases order that, Moderna around 50. None happened. 6 Pfizer‚Äôs infected come vaccine group, they‚Äôll go 150. current tempo that‚Äôs going while...

It‚Äôs great vaccines moving forward quickly, people getting bit carried away quick stage three candidates going finish. spent 8 days hospital failing kidneys corpus christi TX. I'm afraid think would happened kidneys waited little longer give out. hoax? seems odd. Still could distribute formula 20m doses distributed hospitals, physicians nurses great help, even 50% efficacy. 

It way enough get mess, something dismissed. Hopefully vaccine manufacturers also end similar numbers. Regardless tough winter. True. It‚Äôs flawed it‚Äôs result many generations giving shit anything (or caring what‚Äôs them) letting rich politicians get away murder later generations pick pieces. 

But yay freedom, amirite?

Don‚Äôt get wrong, days love American. isn‚Äôt right, nobody anything it. feels helpless uncertain, do? Wait four years til someone magically appears gives fuck? likely. hate America. /s it‚Äôs odd reaction everyone ‚Äúyou‚Äôll exposed expose them‚Äù. We‚Äôre already exposed LOL

Are seriously suggesting healthcare professionals appropriate training protection gear exposed asymptomatic carrier exposing family? 

The odd thing either A) hospital protect staff properly B) family kind protection home christmas would would hopsital. Either way think obvious people say ""You'll expose family"" thinking peculiar situation. TLDR:
Speed, careful tracing, stringent quarantine.

And old comforting story island, like UK, cases introduced illegal land-border crossings ever would play role. anything, cultural mindset living island.

In Germany, authorities difficulties even thinking closing border would change anything, deeply engrained upbringing. Actually flip side cost us far proper shut downs. going take us longer recover woulda taken care people froze econony. people brain wash people like thinking possible. mask sex lady. case, spread virus everywhere. happened Italy first lockdown announced March Um America boy. stand freedoms something Idk honestly. Well much 10000 it. sound full scale at.least yet. Paxton care anybody else's life own. Paxton needs removed office need genocide. goals healthy society odds ownership class. That's literally it. viruses transmissible COVID-19 is. Yes agree more. eat inside, drink inside, meet friends inside someone's house. People need start thinking indoor activities extremely risky take many precautions possible need inside something. Masks, Hand Washing, Keep distance, get quickly. Hmmm....

Thoughts *and*...prayers Welcome club - Europe  Heartbreaking: Worst Person Know Made Great Point Godspeed Europe, things going tough little while. Nazi regime defeated Christmas!

Kaiser Wilhelm defeated Christmas!

I'm sensing theme. I‚Äôve seen couple times wasn‚Äôt ICU can‚Äôt confirm patient patient patient nurse patient. I‚Äôve seen people initially test negative get re-tested couple days test positive we‚Äôve relaxed PPE rules around them. However likely reason initial false negative test. way prove patient didn‚Äôt already came in. 

Only one time I‚Äôve seen someone hospital long time multiple negative tests suddenly test positive. know nursing homes patients spreading either directly via healthcare workers **this fine** One COVID.

We've lucky know it. tourist destination, near interstate, attract outsiders droves. Quiet little part state, mostly people live/work delivery folks.

We also adamant masks, sanitizer, testing quarantining. Anyone traveled voluntarily self quarantines gets tested. Community decided Halloween ""drive by"" decorated cars driving communities, using devices launch small candies towards children costumes front yard/driveway. 200 cars signed up!

Discussing Thanksgiving Xmas options work. lining outside masks social distancing. 

Who kidding, America. unnecessary hostility, dude? progress made?  keep pointing past that's end argument. salty scientist get grant wanted? Please shoot everyone planet vaccine even refuse move on. refuse get 10.000 fine. F*ck freedom kills others. think you‚Äôre reading 30-40 million people 1/3 homes. also says *may risk* *now risk*. 

Think tank click fair me. üòï contact tracer, mom taught public school 20+ years retired years ago. breaks heart every time let teacher know exposed. It‚Äôs honestly one hardest parts job. fucking preventable Ok, compare US virtually European country recommendation change back 500 people drawn FHM least two months ago.

Then government sat entire time nothing appointed serves pleasure Johnson, power veto decisions ministers make. Hopefully election finally bring humility ‚Äúpatriots‚Äù 

Fat fucking chance. checking board, probably it. 

Worrying abiut sympton Trump signs HUUUUuuuuuuuggggge there. second thought suggesting infect others phone like ""wait, 1st april 6 months ago! "". Another dumb fuck everybody. Also LC numbers also climbing here. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll shut us pretty soon, too. Good list. department stores, example person watching thermal camera entrance. son quarantine checked daily, also dropped by, spirit ‚Äúanything need get you?‚Äù yes, paid hundred bucks thank you. (The fine leaving quarantine US$30,000).

I teach university country outside Tainan, need temperature reading entering campus, also take phot seating arrangements every day, case someone got sick would exposed (nobody did).

But amazing thing was/is: nobody minded/minds it, cooperative effort feels sensible. meet someone, people come bump elbows instead shake hands. Everyone constantly aware enormous sense safety high quality life depends it.   know like coming moaning literally every day understand going turn Sweden Bergamo. make difference epidemological perspective means world small sport cultural organizations.

Life goes normal V√§sterbotten. Zero people ICU Oh god, yes! course! Obviously!

So maybe people power listen actual experts say stop trying ‚Äúinnovate‚Äù gambling lives fortunes people responsible protecting. know Jesus said, turn cheek get better shot.....maybe Jesus say that.  _right_ religious book, minds. votes comments debunking content count ""engagement"" platform reddit. 

A video one vote billion votes would show every YouTube home page. hope states first help states later Usually cases reported day (not Tuesday though, since several days without reports then) previous day smaller part day before. terrible take, researchers well aware rolling averages. Deaths vary nearly much entire country 300 million people. +/- 1% year. death chart looks like clearly wrong. shits giggles here's death data 2015-2018.

Deaths year: 

2015: 2.712 million

2016: 2.744 million

2017:2.813 million

2018: 2.839 million

Pretty consistent, albeit rising marginal number every year population. followed trend probably looking maybe 2.9-2.95 million deaths 2020. 

We're going closer 3.2 million deaths year low side. Possibly ~3.4 million. 20M vulnerable vaccinated start. still counting resident deaths? would imagine also missing deaths since Florida originally excluding would also reported someone's home state. would include number snowbirds use Florida legal residence cheaper crash car repair too. Funny thing safety, save lives, almighty dollar rich people worried about. even read Bible first sentence ""God wants acquire property defend rifles"" Beto got El Paso blue think Tegell secretly wants stricter recommendations rest FHM government? think part whole temporarily embarrassed millionaire thing. want put kinds restrictions ruling class want restrictions become ruling class (which definitely never, ever happen.)

If people could accept going remain relatively poor rest lives basically generations come, would probably vote differently. doesn't. way PCR process utilized find grandfather's grandmother's DNA wanted to. bad science misused. fatalist outlook life depressing bad mental health. really can‚Äôt tell you‚Äôre kidding üòÇ. decided leave candy outside case get trick treaters.

Wooo tories!! Fellow Canadian. actually pay roughly per capita America pays annually healthcare [broadly similar often better average health Oh yeah, definitely crazy. believe right arm shit getting hand. It‚Äôs super blue. werent Ft. Bliss would probably 95% Democrat voting every election. 100 years? Rather optimistic you. Federal agency fails trump? 

Imagine shock! Interesting thought we‚Äôre missing first part covid graphs March .. don‚Äôt data show long numbers took grow levels testing roll initial super high bar tested .. it‚Äôs hard draw inferences based previous data Chillin seattle like Oh wow, mean nobody CDC thought account population growth?

Love rubes brilliant insights. ""high level immunity"" ""probably be"" vs ""has achieved herd immunity"" ... totally yeah, forget ignore context nuance suits you. Ah man, read bunch thread thinking r/conservative pleasantly surprised reasonable everyone being. world would be... whose ideals recognize current pandemic threat public health fail cooperate address problem hand selfish ideals, corporate personal. Therefore, ideals.

In state emergency public health, mandating actions proven science mitigate growing pandemic threat legal actionable protect safety health people. Therefore, looking standpoint ""infringing *my* rights"" self-centered narrow-minded attitude take nation downward spiral health economy. ded. Idiocracy would utopia 10 months, 8M infected 230,000 died. first month vaccinates 20M people, goes hell long way especially given vulnerable.

We basically live control environment point. administration, US CDC posts worldwide track aid governments various outbreaks. huge hand stemming things like swine flu Ebola. yes, everyone affected, real effect failures US federal government gotten bad.  actually one things makes living states tolerable. What's good Californians may good Oklahomans.. putting powers hands states makes things worthwhile, ""red blue"" states.... unfortunately, times like ignorant pieces trash leading us spewing misinformation left right, division becomes apparent impossibly difficult manage.

At point figure weeks infections reach 200k day death toll starts climbing exponentially. 

It's going long hard winter. Last week?

X - Doubt think look titles different links:

&amp;#x200B;

The explanation right there. One full specifically chosen metrics date ranges (that's important bit) support narrative, data site.

&amp;#x200B;

It depends saying here. USA ""third wave"" want call that, worst big countries Europe? No. every country (besides maybe Japan, China, SK) entering winter worse before. We're bad, countries too.

But assertion mean someone middle pack general response total, that's way off. Currently we've 69.4 deaths per 100K people USA vs 15.1 deaths per 100K globally, pretty abysmal people believe 'best country world' Sooo..Looks like stupid people still gathering Idaho. Next.

Also, high school AV club could made better production video, folks taxpayer dollars pay productions!

It's different kind toxic compared see social media platforms. Brainwashed religion monkeys. We‚Äôre rounding many turns fast I‚Äôm gonna barf side! Yay!

Socialism essentially democracy workplace (social ownership means production), yet ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù lovers oppose it. shouldn‚Äôt surprised many also support electoral college. long scroll find it? 5096 new cases, 51 new deaths. know nothing idaho, wtf guys. peer-reviewed? Sadly, used think kinda pics normal. came back overseas, realized fucking warped order think kinda pictures thing ISIS Taliban post propaganda purposes. Americans never travel outside city unfortunately. Make everyone motherfuckers dig deceased graves face deceased family members (via zoom). Wrong, test cases find, % positive better metric specifically gives better view prevalent virus area. also think wrong try get spread hospital's capacity.... half-hearted measures....

I agree. trying wipe out, close that, every reasonable measure can, time. never going choice virus economy. whether lockdown officially not, least half population brains *will* lock anyway, destroy economy. healthcare system collapse, destroy economy. 

China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand shown solve this. Heck, historical examples 100 years ago prove effective solutions healthcare systems *and* economy distancing, mask wearing done strictly.

Let put way think good comparison:

If ask Atlanta Falcons 2016-17 football season, list ""winning Super Bowl"" one **""acheivements""** (a word specifically refers something ""completed successfully""), would accurate statement despite fact gave massive lead ended losing New England Patriots overtime?

Of course not, lost game.

They *were* winning one point though (for game, actually), technically true way, since word ""win"" implies completion (similar ""end"" word used example), team going list ""winning Super Bowl"" **achievement** lost lead lost game.

You list ""Winning Super Bowl"" list **achievements** goddamn Super Bowl.

Similarly, list ""Ending global pandemic"" list **achievements** (things completed successfully) end goddamn global pandemic (or trying claim did).

Do see comparison? Well it‚Äôs supposed closed except people work across border. problem it‚Äôs lot people go back forth. Also, Customs doesn‚Äôt really check anything make sure authorized cross border many people actually need commute back forth Tegnell unilatery decides crowd size limit either direction. even FHM change want - government put law place change national level. Ah shit. wish husband well. Please encourage take care mental &amp; emotional health much possible this, definitely this. Nobody lives there. They're probably 49th capita per capita. ""Yes, I've Trump Rally."" I'm saying definitely source, gyms seem small potatoes compared situations. So, think Finland lockdown again? Honestly fast food incredibly addicting. People sheep. ""Everyone's must ok, we're together!"" lower two charts population adjusted: several small EU countries terribly, Belgium worst country world per capita new infections past days. Czech head start deaths per capita recently, Belgium higher new case count likely surpass Czech daily death count coming days.

There also world map NYTimes subscriber updated daily showing cases/deaths per 100k pretty easy see things moving around.

Scarily, strain Belgium new, may simply infectious now. don‚Äôt agree article alarmist. majority infected current outbreak Europe infected new mutation, it‚Äôs really interesting study see differences spike protein, more/less infectious more/less deadly. Like super interesting. Hello El Pasoan! tough national news stuff like this, huh? 

I'm really happy mask compliance thing, least grocery stores. entire pandemic come across incident moment felt unsafe someone else's refusal wear one grocery shopping. 

I friends work restaurant bar industries, say mask compliance (and compliance social distancing guidelines general) bad customers employees. I'm inclined agree restaurants least partially driving factor surge cases. 

I doubt factor, considering quickly things escalated I'm sure officials ever able paint really clear picture specific causes. Contact tracing becomes bit impossible threshold. 

I recall spring officials stated travel Juarez reason cases EP, months ago. never thought mayor Juarez would ask Mexican government restrict border crossings though. know places also affected besides US right? Corkscrew going upwards! Person 1: ‚ÄúBetter play safe make sure send includes female.‚Äù

Person 2: ‚ÄúYou mean female astronaut?‚Äù

Person 1: ‚ÄúYeah, sure, whatever.‚Äù Beto really dropping ball. haven‚Äôt even begun peak! saying Jews causing problems? That's good. sharpest tool shed.

Fauci telling need it.

And making rules. virus is. link breakdown cities? constitution makes distinction federal state powers? thought basic human rights. Remindme! 2 weeks Order bidet now! This. fact, local polling place system set curbside voting truly cannot come inside reason. That's basically unenforceable. Right time election... Koo kooo koooo kkkeeeewwwwl know sarcastic, but.... people say factor number hospitalization supportive medication factored in. would much lower without that. Would first lockdown? Man, fist lockdown feels like years ago. March year, still somehow years ago. 

If everyone commits together, get back ""normal"" sooner. Haha I'm fan Rogan (although much recently seems gone bit right-wing said stupid shit since Covid hit) thinking earlier would interesting Texas lock like Cali, turned blue election, got Covid himself, combination three. Trump said rounding corner??!? would Republican state covid issues true!?! telling Trump lied? That's literally impossible. Clearly democrat fake news. John Malkovich? helps government give free flu vaccinations qualify (Asthma, Old age etc) employers willing pay cost vaccinations employees FUCK speed limits too! can't drive 55!! apparently idea lockdowns work. get weekly rations, still allowed leave home essential stuff (like grocery shopping). Non-essential businesses closed, companies still operate. many european states locked again, even schools open.

And lockdowns worked well first phase March/August. relaxed summer Germany Austria everything open. Pretty sure better economy would never contained virus. Massachusetts world needs rather dick measuring handling better.  point Leftism might enough, stupids literally ruining everyone else. Might go full eugenics. I‚Äôm sure fuck going wear one goddamn Yeah didn‚Äôt really pick hit Seattle nursing home, BOOM.

I feel like see better now, much info though. Interesting! 

There localized shutdowns California summer. know they'll state (PA, god I'm glad moved TX) numbers get unmanageable levels. shutdowns happening much long hotspots continue rural/Republican-led areas, difficult predict level US daily cases happening. remains case, see shutdowns happening even US 300k cases per day. pessimistic hell US response virus point. Great argument lol. really understand presidents supposed step lead national emergencies? know call people names? one demanding people bend knee demented ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù former resident surprisingly blue. Probably safe city (normally) Mexican culture celebrated. Glad stocked popcorn last month. Give biggest pile shit dumpster fire fellow Americans. Houston, CT/IR/XRAY tech here. even recall last time slept well anymore. Tired understatement everyone know medical field now. 

With single exception. know happens tired? BS ""CEO"" ""nonprofit"" hospitals like tell public everything fine, need worry all! Magically even little bit tired! load crap... still weeks away kind peak. major population centers northeast, Texas, Florida, California back swing things ramping case counts. 

I think reason expect hospitalizations shorter, death rates lower, widespread time hard say. Swamped hospitals main problem. entire central valley Trump country... masks. vote pandemic get worse federal government continues deny aid struggling Americans, deny loans struggling businesses, literally deny pandemic still happening. USA currently getting cases per *minute* Australia (with approx 1/12 population) getting per *week* El paso quite blue 2018, could Beto though. I'm going stop right point NYC school system MASSIVE issues considering much money spent it. can't say rest state looks like education wise massive population node huge issue education something brag about. Maybe not. hypothesis may true. Man, really wish virus would hit administration. 1 big thing costco, wife (only 2 people house guess) bought february, still enough left last new years. Even family 4, I'd say would last quite while. sure need entire shopping cart full. Laughing NYC.

Sorry, seriously. People almost year listen. name? Yes, pen ready? It‚Äôs ‚ÄúI. C. Wiener.‚Äù Exactly. talk people like eyes one's home. even hear words covid etc. Scary expensive increase icu beds. Also need staff icu. Yeah, it‚Äôs bad 10 month long social isolation Well herd immunity get someday. governors acting like ""tyrants"" rise attributed colleges. I'm student myself, I'm also home. people think rules apply them, they're getting infected. colleges quite lax enforcement, costing them. Others quite strict ‚Äî mine bring conduct charges _automatically_ much set foot outside dorm room without mask (even going bathroom). god everywhere fucking zoom/youtube/facebook live church GoFundMe donation box.

Fuck, I‚Äôm worried El Paso know people kids covid went treak treating tonight

Literally bringing Covid people's doorsteps. can't nice things. probably people fatigued letting guard bit, also gets colder people inside virus spreads easily. that‚Äôs guess though. 

Also add least live (in WNY) rural areas hit opposed earlier Buffalo hit hardest area. I‚Äôd imagine rural WNY Trump country limited experience haven‚Äôt seen nearly many masks there. Another proud superspreader.

Your parents failed. Hahaha made audibly laugh be, asked this. Yep. dumb playing football right now. Heck invasion body snatchers even Trump replaced would mandating take pods home put bed. Defeat them. People also answer phone. penalty talking tracers highly unethical make someone sick purposefully. addition, practically impossible. also imagine everyone sick time for, let's say, two four weeks. Enjoy chaos. month death toll would unimaginable. COVID. due chaos side effects everyone sick time. Hilarious. feel like flu season becoming scapegoat cities handled reopenings poorly. Take New York LA. strict reopenings seeing minor bump likely tied holidays gatherings (Lakers championship LA). Cities Texas haven‚Äôt taken seriously getting wrecked. Chicago opened rapidly recently announced close indoor dining numbers exploding. murder moms?? guy rocker independent sources confirm China Covid control. check exported cases China reported countries (been zero months now) reports hundreds thousands foreigners live work China.

All foreign companies also reported business back normal nobody reporting employees catching COVID. 

If China didn‚Äôt control, hospitals would overflowing would lot local reports foreign expats/journalists/businesses, far evidence that.

It seems like think information effectively hidden China. can‚Äôt, China isn‚Äôt North Korea. Remember Dr.Li, whistleblower, gained western media coverage becoming famous *Chinese social media* first.

So yeah, claiming secret pandemic going China large number deaths cases still, burden proof you. 
Very unlikely. Work done identify likely timeline based changes RNA. study identify strains cont. articles 8 months old, referenced current reflections pandemic responses globally.

Pleasantly surprised see level civility empathy pop unprompted. rare days online forums people disagree. Well good thing we're heading contentious election one side significantly polls everything possible steal election anyway. were, number serious injuries due civil unrest next weeks could skyrocket!

Good thing aren't, right? I‚Äôll tell what, welcome take every precaution book, rest us living like normal people. well earlier can't closed borders states mainland's cases leak No, new single-day records means we, too, failed control this. remember feeling shocked core crossed 100k cases.

Now we're almost hitting 100k day feel numb. long, thanks scarves. It‚Äôs least good way soften real estate market little think misunderstood I'm saying numbers worrying Italy trouble. Simply stating can't directly compare case numbers today say March considering testing increased dramatically Italy along othet countries missing far cases back due limited testing. can't possibly tell 5k cases Italy getting back March accurate considering high deaths hospitals filled covid patients? Italy probably seeing 30k cases back well higher

If we're going compare second wave first wave we're better comparing hospitalisations directly give us accurate idea are. fully agree things looking bad Italy case numbers number hospitalisations. simply stating official case numbers March pretty much useless considering many cases missed back miss Eisenhower Republicans:

* Desegregated Washington, DC Military
* Warned massive military budgets military-industrial complex
* Brought AK HI
* Declared racism national security issue
* Created interstate highway system
* Created NASA noticed, France Belgium already lockdown hospitalizations high. remember heart measures implemented countries like Czechia Poland, lockdown too. easy get fooled low hospitalization numbers comparison high case numbers, cases increase exponentially eventually hospitalizations increase exponentially well. No. care Trump says says anything. care politicians do. remember Daily podcast months ago stated expect vaccines released less four years. Even Michael Barbaro caught guard Donald said that. great see even much optimism vaccine development back then. Percentages go denominator. Today‚Äôs denominator 30,000 tests. rate plummeted today. 

That‚Äôs say it‚Äôs bad thing. testing catches asymptotic spreaders. throw percentages bit. Hell, probally 500 thousand day thanksgiving. Lack Leadership thank you! till see Belgium, 11 million 20k cases. Probably today.

I checked WO , USA already past 91k.  shitshow either way next week. see herd immunity real not. Imagine would happen told boss ""nah, I'm gonna job""

You'd fired.

Also, strict mandatory quarantine entering country mandatory tracking contact tracing app install use.

Long story short, taking measures *it's working*. like keeping cases low physically impossible. kind data going skewed fact parents get young kids tested sick. School aged kids get testing need return school. look meta-analysis existing data children, found kids younger 10 44% less likely get infected compared adults. tweet news source itself. BNO News literally news source. legitimate media channel. let shit speak itself.

Ironically Swedish peasoup pork dinner. we‚Äôre pandemic flu. 40-50% people get coronavirus vaccine it‚Äôs 50% effective, eradicate pandemic? 

This NPR vaccine 50% effective, ‚ÄúThe extent vaccine emerges help halt COVID-19 pandemic depends many people get immunization.

In order put pandemic rearview mirror, large percentage population needs either vaccinated gain immunity via infection probably 49th capita per capita.

50% time math works every time.  I'm almost certain stop taking measures moment vaccine table- regardless whether they've vaccinated. going get really messy first months release, hopefully enough people figure hold preemptive celebration enough curb pandemic.

Whole lot figure crossing best tho. Perhaps Dr Atlas plan along; downplay virus, suggest herd-immunity open ports cruises. paid. work grocery store PA assure every grocery store worker wearing masks 100% time. I'd guess closer 50% employees store. even managers wear masks consistently. remember reading Kansas kept bay, happened? see getting downvoted, get frustration. difficult keep hoping loved ones stay safe give shit act recklessly.

That's pretty strong statement make based study 14 people median 54 days onset symptoms 

and even then, 1 B cells that's despite symptomatic (so might true people asymptomatic.) Redditors exactly sort people comfortable enough won‚Äôt face hunger homelessness lockdowns don‚Äôt like reminded contradiction hysterically shrieking ‚ÄúSTAY HOME‚Äù everyone living DoorDash labor people allowing stay home also see problem. resent working class people choice work ‚ÄúTHEYRE KILLING GRAMMAS‚Äù also shoveling chicken tendies DoorDash cooked delivered working class people gaping maw play vidja games.

Getting results back 85-90% pretty tough number argue could actually 35-40%, unheard of. LOL... ok I‚Äôm making three figures

Well, school go to? want make sure kids never go near feel three figures ""a whole lot lose"" Second this. looks like newspaper Saskatchewan. Granted National Post best newspaper inbCanada leans right centre, however see reason believe him. would preferahbe academic paper based experience/research. 

Having said that, numerous peer reviewed papers indicated antibodies last 3-4 months.  Unfortunately, think we're going see lot opportunistic flu infections, possibly.

It's basically balancing covid measures, versus everyone's immune systems compromised stress infection. bet takes far smaller viral load infect covid+ secondary infection.

Wish best, things gonna tough. saw documentary Yes, problem using positivity rates gauge reopening status test, cases find, sort inflates numbers. Remember Obama said conservatives cling bibles guns? 

226k dead and, ""the pandemic may happening.""

Now conservatives reading pretend outraged. Cause, know? Truth, facts logic guys' strong suit. Lollllllllllllll Hating prevents becoming something new Lifestyle choices accidental deaths largest drivers lower US life expectancy. Obesity rates among highest world crime car accidents also contributing early deaths.

The US highest cancer survival rates world, shows quality care. best hospitals cutting-edge treatments also US someone like afford them, wouldn‚Äôt trade anything Europe. Username checks I'm sure plenty Christians would say they've ""heard voice,"" even they've never seen him. So, logic, bubbles still believers. probably one reasons coronavirus hoax Christianity \[edit: THEM\].

Personally, consider agnostic.

Edit -- clear. think hoax. real me. internal monologue certain group people US: 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs real American needs defeat pandemic, pandemic, isn‚Äôt, need case. God, gun, Lifted truck, Stars Stripes. colors don‚Äôt run, baby.‚Äù. It‚Äôs good sign top comment. 41,000 tests today... truly hope covid destroys aspect lives every single person stands way basic public health measures. Nope It‚Äôs said scale numbers becoming increasingly detached impact causes.

But cases increase finite population, people affected. Something‚Äôs got give downplay virus ever growing number deaths.

I know subset folks deny even organs shut tipping point somewhere? so, it?  virus = worse outcome, which, though intuitive, always case. Another advertisement wearing masks (you get smaller dose exposed). wont. Orangina going win set us path extreme fascism. Remember Obama got criticized statement people ‚Äúcling guns religion‚Äù? right.  Cunt. stupid ones throughout time make thank goodness

The stupid ones also tend kids offset that... Still got Vermont? Reddit really got you, eh? never said hate it! loved there. It‚Äôs great place much miss it, safe pandemic. rent pay piles debt. one's really winning long run. Get used tell tho?

Currently 1 Swedish Krona equal 1.07 Norwegian krona. preatty similar.

Buying Pizza Norway usually atleast twice expensive Sweden. 
However buying diapers Sweden twice expensive Norway. trying say? fat?!?!? love one girl using ""I Muslim friends"" excuse awful ways. That‚Äôs good source, want filter everything numbers updates. I‚Äôd like could see posts laws/responses, discoveries, dumb things people CDC say. Paxton walk rolls Abbott...straight short pier. Many us educated *and* hate ourselves. Alternative what? still doubting efficacy see numbers.

Thanks captain obvious. Yes was. refuse admit it, outcome.

With viral epidemic three ways ends. first way use quarantines prevent infected people spreading virus uninfected people, bringing transmission virus halt.

The ways via herd immunity bringing transmission halt due lack susceptible hosts. herd immunity gained naturally via large proportion population becoming infected, artificially via large proportion population vaccinated.

Tegnell FHM made clear start expect vaccine developed time. rules artificial herd immunity.

They also refused enforce kinds quarantines required halt spread infection without herd immunity.

So leaves one last possible outcome ""strategy"" - natural herd immunity result large proportion population infected becoming immune.

Even refuse admit it, herd immunity possible outcome ""strategy"".

So, quit denying obvious. one buying bullshit anymore. think evidence suggesting starter numbers inaccurate. Could either hidden lack testing novelty. satellite images captured mobile crematoriums burning day night weeks. think even ended burning out. restaurant since early March. Seeing groups people TV pulling masks take bite food convinced time go back. OMFG WRONG THINK!!!! RNC won‚Äôt.

Meanwhile, much difficulty enrolling ORCHID hydroxychloroquine study many people convinced (erroneously hindsight) worked, unwilling randomized.

Marik also arguing article may unethical test ivermectin placebo. We've seen make argument different cocktail, seen wrong.

I think makes reasonable argument reconsider studying ivermectin larger trial. However, studies he's basing impassioned argument high risk bias low certainty evidence. Many peer-reviewed, one later retracted.

Although lone outsider genius common TV trope, almost never case real science. group docs run multi enter trials considerable expertise reviewing data determine ivermectin promising enough commit limited resources large multi enter trial time. surprising reinfections possible, nothing far suggests statistically significant. commenting besides tax reasons he's talked texas would never infringe person's right work repeatedly said California ever shut down... yeah probably fans do?

I surprised, ideal strategy harmful mind-virus take, evil never stupid - survive was. Everything evolve.

But even realms petty stuff, people learn. everyone like seatbelts airbags much do. Lots people realize car crumples to.

I think failure education. Even could enforce laws time, ethical nightmare, can't legislate people believe right things. We'd end everyone wearing seatbelts denouncing Nazism right got enough popular vote repeal seatbelt laws put Nazi power again.

But mandating education, that's infinite regression. People already love kids go public school 8 hours day strangers different beliefs teach kids things believe. made draconian, would build resentment whole institution public schooling, would tool fascism could wield gained power.

My dad lives house someone tested positive COVID-19 yesterday. last time dad saw guy week half ago, i‚Äôm unsure whether masked not. dad helped sister move past weekend, masked (we wear masks around he‚Äôs household personal trust reasons); also spent hour two days ago repairing fence (masked). doubt dad honest test results, he‚Äôll receive soon- question is- even dad tests negative, worried family exposed? tests positive, we‚Äôre definitely quarantining family. not, good reason to? disagree mother this, personally needs go work (she‚Äôs 90% time). sister works preschool, sister nannies kid nurse, there‚Äôs definite reason safe.


TLDR: dad C19 exposure. tests negative, (masked contact knew exposure) need still quarantine? cue businesses essential refuse close claiming are. assumption first wave missed vast majority cases awful wave still bad. president said beaten virus.. know bad Texas shuts down. sight, mind. 9/11 recently shit France, everyone could see tragedy happen front eyes. virus, though, it‚Äôs hard relate cases hits family, friend, yourself.

Houston, problem Grocery store employees likely heightened risk COVID-19 infection, customer-facing roles 5 times likely test positive colleagues positions, suggests first study kind, published journal Occupational &amp; Environmental Medicine.

What's more, among testing positive, three four symptoms, suggesting key workers could important reservoir infection, say researchers.

Published research focusing essential/key workers largely focused healthcare workers. try plug knowledge gap find COVID-19 affected health wellbeing key workers, researchers studied 104 employees one grocery store Boston, Massachusetts.

Each employee tested SARS-CoV-2, virus responsible COVID-19 infection, May year part mandatory testing policy across Boston.

But so, completed detailed questionnaires on: lifestyle; medical history; employment history; working patterns role store; commuting work; protective measures able take infection work.

They also asked provide information COVID-19, including symptoms exposure anyone confirmed SARS-CoV-2 past 14 days. Information mental health gleaned two validated questionnaires depression anxiety: PHQ-9 GAD-7.

One five (21 104) workers tested positive SARS-CoV-2, indicating prevalence 20% point time. significantly higher prevalence infection local community time: 0.9-1.3%.

Three four testing positive (76%) symptoms. testing positive, (91%) customer facing role compared 59% testing negative.

Workers customer facing roles five times likely test positive colleagues types role, accounting potentially influential factors, prevalence SARS-CoV-2 lived. supervisory roles six times likely so.

Ninety-nine employees filled mental health questionnaires: 24 workers reported least mild anxiety. half (46%) said able practice social distancing consistently work, whereas (76%) anxious able so.

Eight employees deemed mildly depressed questionnaire answers. less likely practice social distancing consistently work likely travel work public transport shared rides compared depressed.

Those able commute foot, bike car 90% less likely report depressive symptoms.

This small observational study workers one store one city one point time, relied subjective reports, such, can't establish cause, caution researchers.

Nevertheless say: ""This first study demonstrate significant asymptomatic infection rate, exposure risks, associated psychological distress grocery retail essential workers pandemic.""

And point out: ""Once essential workers infected SARS-CoV-2, may become significant transmission source community serve.""

They believe findings support: ""the policy recommendations employers government officials take actions implementing preventive strategies administrative arrangements, methods reduce interpersonal contact, repeat routine SARS-CoV-2 employee testing, ensure health safety essential workers.""

And add: ""Our significant mental health finding calls action providing comprehensive employee assistance services help essential workers cope psychological distress COVID-19 pandemic."" share whistleblower bullshit exactly that. Seriously stop believing everything read shitty media actually look facts. think need citation that. seen anything suggests anything 60-70% (for 2-dose estimated available next year), would extremely optimistic accounts.

""by christmas"" sounds like bullshit I'll upvote it, read like cyberpunk release date headlines. I'll believe see it. San Antonio pretty good too. Though numbers begun tick bit. Nirenberg handled things well. idiot zombies cannot wear mask end spreading virus people without even knowing virus first place. That's I'm dealing Texas. Hypothetically speaking, El Paso goes lockdown (against governor's orders), state do? send Texas national guard take over? stop sending money? I'm curious feel like governor taking enough action, one that's gonna trouble.

For example, county next (Hidalgo), Starr county south Texas. end world began, started lockdowns kept things contained...until governor decided open things force state open, things got control.

Also, could cities and/or counties and/or citizens sue careless decision making stopping keeping citizens safe? Ohio already signed law giving businesses legal immunity covid-related lawsuits. zero recourse us. least legal recourse. simply true. that's dedication cause issue getting tied free labor friends. filters dont go floor, yes, mopping go grates, little trough grates, angled direct runoff drain. space floor raised floor taken fans attached hoses attached flooring space.

There‚Äôs pandemic going on. rallies president holding super spreaders. watch Biden rally home television Zoom. America gone backwards recently. important! wish people would stop thinking ""completely done"" vs ""herd immun."" strategy. natural immunity + vaccinated immunity hits even 20-30%, lot fewer points spread. Technically, masks works effectively said(like 85%) already archived herd immunity rate already. Ah, catch typo. don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs confused. It‚Äôs legitimate point. Separate whether would good policy, federal government limited powers US Constitution. can‚Äôt pass law subject want. specific enumerated powers, everything else reserved states. also don‚Äôt nationwide law enforcement personnel. federal system like US different situation unitary system like countries.

Why? poorly? really politics driving cruelty? explain disjointed response national character? lot research goes labs well known public surrounding areas, much less public writ large. Facilities nature also tendency overseen entities get lions share budgetary resources, usually resulting less ideal oversight. driving virology epidemiology underground, think that's likely.

/S Damn guys really want people die reason Funny acknowledge im commenting instead dig deep post history. must alot time hands
Looking post history seem get rocks attacking people, pretty pathetic dude. antimaskers... people think thin layer cloth protect they're protesting tens thousands others, people think ok dine outdoors exposing service staff report misinterpreting CDC data. official death certificates, 6% reported Covid without causes. 

The 94% death certificates show Covid, pneumonia, cardiac arrest, kidney failure etc. Covid attacks multiple organs, would correct list causes. 

The CDC uses ICD code U07.1. code specifically states covid primary cause death. 225,000 deaths reported CDC marked U07.1. Someone covid died car accident U07.1 (covid death). states explicitly guidelines yet conspiracy theorists refuse think. 

Moreover, big hoax fake covid deaths receive federal money, plan terrible. Hospitals lost enormous sums money cancel elective procedures, cash cow. Hospitals LOSING money, they're begging government bailout money. 

These conspiracy theories ridiculous, logic terrible. Truly good news ass. Nothing changed virus way treated explains 300% reduction death. NYC hospitals overloaded March, August, simple.

This death rate behind us, ahead us. Across entire country time, one localized corridor. 400 people there? live rural central Washington everyone wears mask. 

If making assumption areas like mine also wearing masks using hand sanitizer, numbers rising?

I work job frequently come contact people close by. 

If make assumption areas mine, yet, infection number rising makes ask question masks work?

I continue use mask whenever I‚Äôm public space, think close contact people, masked not, distributes virus. think 6+ feet distancing effective mask. average convery distribution. current spikes spread instead concentrated large cities iternational airports. Before, hospitals hiring high COVID areas actually firing staff low COVID areas hospitals empty losing profit. I'm sure that's still happenening, everywhere medium COVID levels starting hit high capacity. I'm ""essential"" restaurant cook ohio. indoor dining rooms reopened may (I believe?) restaurant (a national franchise) followed law less week; simply let customers go unmasked times.

Too many people getting angry threatening beat 16-year-old hostess wanted give free mask.

Same thing every single retail store; sign door says masks mandatory, ONE stops maskless. ONE asked leave store whatsoever.

I would say mask usage 25% area. People really like facts sub. news. malicious actor plain ignorant? Here's many

Looks like AG already threatened one... 3rd wave happening Idiots wear masks keep going eat bars found loop hole started serving food thats able stay open. really ridiculous what's going right El Paso. People acting entitled large gatherings parties. absolutely ridiculous. instead praying something actually help them? forced places mask mandates rescind them, killing thousand

They acquiesce demands. quite ""forcing"". El Paso would best served letting courts rule law decide, rather giving governor. minimal economic displacement powerful people country exactly what's happening right now. Minimal economic displacement everybody else lot different, everybody else powerful people they? Joe rogan seething right feel best mention instead country state cases. US like Federation fact states mostly independent oversight federal government. (Could wrong this.) make lockdown laws. diffrent note possible States close borders? Someone explain scientifically understanding cells memory exposed virus produce antibodies. Trump said weeks last debate?

/s (but actually say that) Yeah, vaccine/therapeutics mean save people shielding longer. hilariously ironic exact people ganged taking things seriously ones espousing hope all. shame. think went HEB insurance might've worked, w/e, Randall's still gave 10% discount coupon. know hospital work NE ohio nearing capacity week gotten ton covid compared previous weeks. Starting overflow units. gonna good week 2. That‚Äôs good info. wonder didn‚Äôt increase ICU beds, good chance increase since April capacity curve flat. Joe really really made seem like biggest problem LA homeless people. Like he's disgusted live amongst look them. Kinda snooty. get it. new Yorkers manage get great compliance? Thats NYC felt 6 months ago. Nowhere statement say anyone deserves die. made simple statement criminals stop committing crimes could cause end jail. world anyone problem statement? Uh... bring up, original comment that.  surprised reaches 100k next 24 hours Good luck Masks infected obvious, basic things like washing/sanitizing hands makes huge difference historically much thing been.

Edit: Encouraging people *actually* use sick leave instead ""pushing it"" coming work sick would probably make largest impact.

It's never one large sweeping change measure changes outcomes, lots little things add meaningful impact.  Sheriffs one dumbest things country has. Wait Thanksgiving. People shop, visit friends families... countries regions reached containment phase 

Did country reach containment phase months spread? far know New zealand, South Korea, etc reacted early cases contanied contact tracing, rest world missed opportunity never coming back OKAY, respect take see coming from, personally still think wait learn more, especially considering antibodies seeming hang around 5 months guys shut shopping malls/retail etc? That's crazy me! washington work 3 months (I work department store) would doubt them? They‚Äôve stated strategy publicly.  local cases, continuous stream exported cases, lol betting lawsuit filed soon Masks also reduce number virus particles exposed to, reduction difference sick home ten days needing hospitalized. Trump said corona over??  Screenshots article:

[The chart, compares COVID rates mask-wearing table  shown dollar taxes pay, virus level decreases True, also notice talking vaccine efforts/therapeutic efforts. like actually want people die, get it. death cult. driving downtown willoughby last night way work. hundreds/thousands kids parents walking around masks on. getting better time soon. lol... thus far. forced places mask mandates rescind them, killing thousands. shit hit fan put statewide mask mandate effect prohibited jail consequence violating. Made warning mandatory first time violators gave police means track multiple offenses. Nearly every sherif state declared mandate unenforceable. mean Ken Paxton committed bribery abuse office. fired **SEVEN** whistleblowers. guy? live small town Ontario, we‚Äôve 75 cases region, 5 active cases now. outdoors seen anyone complying mask orders I'm American, husband is. adores history said rules USA built actually say mandate stop covid spread right now, (and guys know better me) apparently laws actually say 'the freedoms american people protected etc etc' goes say one person's right ends means impacts anothers, laws protect everyone's rights. basically, someone wearing mask, put life danger still 70% chance getting even wearing mask (we're excluding n95s here). protecting freedoms want wear masks, protecting freedoms need work, enjoy walk, go appointments want economies open up.


So someone irresponsibly passes HIV knowing could infectious, they're punished right? C19 leave brain damaged... (8.5 IQ points ave - Imperial College study).


I'm pretty sure nobody every wrote laws thinking 'this protect people's opinions wear. I'm pretty sure protect human rights.

Wearing mask living fear every time leave house, losing job, starving potentially future ending disabled. Wearing mask put massive strains marriage, education mental health. real fears. 

Until everyone realises going away without massive extremely strict quarantine we're going keep punishing ourselves. crazy politicians using c19 multiple options proceed (one saves lives one saves economy) like thought February - done China-style lock stayed doors watching movies 6 weeks food delivered...... could done now! Personally I'd rather 6 weeks 10/10 bad still savings, electricity food - years 6/10 bad - freedom ability adjust c19 completely goes human nature around others. 

I really understand happening. understand people, like plants feelings. virus care think understand politicians making sorts decisions many lives stake (lets forget deep economic depression, masses disabled people potential wars fighting years come way handling it). 7 months lock down!!!!!!!!! would taken 6 weeks extreme lock we'd out! Source? Doubtful change actions even death toll 1000 day. Look helpers. friends currently China everything returns normal except everyone wearing masks.

That evidence everything control. could be, observation proof. go US states like Florida, Georgia (even Texas weeks ago) hardly realize there's pandemic going (people even bother wear masks). country complete control hospitals, media forms communications social media site used world banned cannot trust anything reported government means verify alternate sources exist. Good thing China already lot experience dealing similar diseases better equipped people definitely compliant lot chance situation far better US Europe. Actually looked back plenty comments mine long term covid still didn‚Äôt even stalk well. I‚Äôm confused think would talk reddit considering use reddit mostly business, since work full time home unable work restaurant anymore due post viral dysautonomia lol 1. People wear wrong masks 
2. People don‚Äôt wear masks correctly 
3. Even mask mandate people pulled took off. see thing Texas GOP propaganda worst  Clemson University Georgia glorious jobs reality tv show joker promised. None based science. based pandering to... coal digging jobs going? Look up.  cannot begin tell profoundly embarrassed America lead charge this. 

We could sending teams world. could flexing mountains scientific logistical muscle gaining huge amounts goodwill process. could heroes. 

Instead, we're plague rats world closed borders against. 

It really stings whatever lingering pride American greatness left, I'll tell much. mean...it‚Äôs ‚Äúclaim‚Äù, it‚Äôs fact Washington Post. Also, since WaPo paywalled? Weird. I‚Äôll take screenshot something. None changed minds though. say there's nothing do, time everyone get infected. one 100 million people underlying conditions 65 US, would scared shitless. people running seriously cool letting get infected overwhelming hospitals. governor anything legislature session? Could be. expert. 

We go minimal. Wear masks. Leave kids home. Sorry friend :( continue take serous. anything else people like us help? mean manufacturing? Yes, every country fault lines demagogues tap profit mayhem. Quarantine sick people. magical asymptomatic spreaders ""seem responsible"" everything.   sick, fever, actual cough.. okay fine. mask.   astronomical made number comes someone's ass.  Protest. Okay. Oh shit, 10 Jews synagogue Christians church... call cops.  thank you.  data justify it.  masks work. wear mask. Problem solved.  would waste good masks BS people wearing N95 whatever 80 somethings everybody hoaxers read article, you? Wheres source? heard starting mass testing tomorrow 2 weekends Man 42% going throw biggest tantrum. heard case quick read holding. 

It ‚Äúcommandeering‚Äù law held unconstitutional. Basically, federal legislation enacted restricted rights states enact sports gambling laws (most) states, all. 

So little different refers commandeering (also unconstitutional), necessarily incentives penalties, it‚Äôs ‚Äúvein‚Äù cases deal federal government overreaching violation 10th amendment.

I could certainly see Congress might try pass mask mandate force states uphold mandate, would likely challenged holding Murphy previous holding Brady. personally think it‚Äôs bit analogous Brady since case specifically dealt trying make state police officers enforce federal law.

This also you‚Äôve seen Joe Biden many instances comment it‚Äôs beyond ‚Äúpower‚Äù federal government he‚Äôs asked national mandate.  Ad hominems actually help argument. 

You answer question. made baseless absurd claim know real death rate US lower official number, despite likelihood number substantially higher official number. SPECIFICALLY disingenuous using deaths per capita? 

Even lie death rate true US's death rate HALF official number would 29th highest death rate world. Even *quarter* official rate we'd still 55th highest rate. 

The US far away wealthiest country world largest concentration biotech healthcare businesses, absolute best hospitals world. 

It preposterous numbers 10th ***lowest*** world. taken necessary steps like countries listed, could been. 

If proof official death rate higher be, present it. anecdote, speculation, hard data. Actual proof. Well poll 1,000 people.. shouldn‚Äôt. Conservative? 

Yes ok, like ok infecting others cold (or better, simply don‚Äôt think it, like one ever done). can‚Äôt life revolving around preventing respiratory infections. soon people mostly protected, it‚Äôs time stop caring. think overestimating many hospitals overrun. never even close Ontario, downward trend. trend everywhere. Anyway good night. Biden wins, monumental task hands. [line minivans go car car instead house house. common.
It's good helicopter parents afraid wicked witches greedy bastards cover ground faster. !Remindme 3 weeks nation experiencing grief, denial phase Yeah bad, I‚Äôm kind idiot bet he's telling yacht Bahamas. Let‚Äôs effing go!!! point this? people every single post current circumstances different countries? weld doors shut spread virus rest world! Money Back Guarantee work? Can‚Äôt treat patients without lots nurses..... number cases fundamental illness. don‚Äôt see anyone could try dispute fact. 15 new cases last 18 days yea, concerned. Lol oops, woke bad Haha, good sport.  Maybe, Belgium hitting US equivalent 700,000 US cases, Chechia reporting 550,000 US equivalent cases one day last week, Switzerland today reporting US equivalent 350,000 cases, France hitting US equivalent 260,000 cases, even admit Europe lot wrong past summer Fall I‚Äôm talking emergence disease. virus originated China. nothing population size. Maybe didn‚Äôt understand comment. still 300 million get infected. Weee. Damn 4 days? Zlatan asymptotic fool Would running air UVC tunnel reduce indoor transmission?

 

Picture this: 18"" diameter polished metal air duct UV-C light running it. Room air circulated duct.

The duct shiny UV hits walls reflected. Getting aluminum 85% reflectivity easy. Would mean every UV-C photon average would get 6 chances crisp viral particle. lowers power requirements.  


Normal practice something like classroom 3 air changes hour. typically winter 80% recycled, 20% make air.

This creates two possibilities reducing exposure: 


A: Increase amount make air. Moving 20% 40% would decrease recycled air 80% 60% reducing exposure 25%

B: Putting UVC bulbs inside lengths duct. right intensity sterilize pathogens travel duct. 

UVC bulbs tanning bulbs. high frequency UV blind give serious burns seconds.  

I know UV water sterilization flow rates common. know exposure time required Covid. Interesting data. forget, good portion major population centres would abilities/will test either... (Indonesia, India, China). really depends neighborhood/borough NYC. went NYC public schools college, quality education top notch, also lived one affluent areas city. schools places like South Bronx ENY, although still good teachers, funding issues unfortunately, socioeconomic issues. evangelical women abortions atheists.

I think made unless see another abortion patients reported religious affiliation‚Äî24% Catholic, 17% mainline Protestant, 13% evangelical Protestant 8% identified religion. Thirty-eight percent patients religious mean Nov 3rd? test results 5-8 days... react confusedly early Big take opportunity send ""M G A"" ""T R U P"" emblazoned masks every household America via FEMA dollars.

""I instituting mask mandate. patriotic duty wear mask protect fellow Americans. Unfortunately extreme mask shortage right now. Therefor, sending every American household four masks US Mail, along stimulus checks every month. Thank helping automatically win November.""  main argument I‚Äôve heard righty people I‚Äôm around they‚Äôd prefer local mandate opposed national. I.e., want state make happen opposed empowering federal government. 

Than super fringe banjo playing swamp people don‚Äôt want wear masks. Unfortunately matter mandate occurs doubt they‚Äôll abide it. Little know coronavirus actually Nurburgring (170 turn race track) live Alabama US. family live various locations east coast around DC area (they work emergency department urgent care clinics). ppe situation better, perfect. get one N95 per week. quit, know wouldn‚Äôt hear end ‚Äúselfish‚Äù healthcare workers signed put lives line. I‚Äôd rather live mostly free country, even means extra deaths pandemic century. explains fast food workers paid minimum wage. *looks rising cases* wonder why? know survival rates, Acquiring property Christian value mine. country sick. luck? I've laughed reporting indoor gatherings 100+ people. I‚Äôm using technology stop virus. track every active case quarantine them, pandemic ends.

The problem is, there‚Äôs entirely many track now.

It would take monumental effort public would behind 100%. Basically you‚Äôd need public, government, private sector board.

I don‚Äôt know get there. virus politicized means there‚Äôs significant portion population actively resist virus mitigation efforts.

The situation become impossible point. People -- Idaho elsewhere: *The people trying limit virus's spread enemy. virus enemy.* partners co-worker/work friend roommate test positive coworker quarantine awaiting test result. partner conversations person daily mask least couple feet them, also sit back towards they‚Äôre facing eachother day. feeling super tired mild sinus issues week, im assuming due early morning work schedule stress dry weather. think quarantining making plans get tested 8 days? basically dont leave house already partner goes work daily, go get to-go food. Thoughts? First time covid gotten within striking distance im kinda freaking ngl accuracy levels really good. 

Two thoughts: 
I think article ever states many COVID coughs asymptomatic people. might deceitful, small minority asymptomatic patients, among misdiagnosed majority them. 

The data might fairly dependent microphone records cough. could matter two ways:  
1. COVID patients recorded mic #1, healthy patients mic #2, algorithm might identifying mic used. case, work phone all. 
2. data collected mic, type mic, algorithm might work mic type mic. 

Couldn't find information either way these, maybe already accounted for. makes app, would amazingly useful tool think! That's unfortunate truth, there's like 13 Euro countries worse US last weeks, some(Czechia, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Netherlands)are much worse why, that, take completely??  muh rights*!!!












*to infect kill people. haven‚Äôt seen studies suggesting 3-4. mind giving source? Also amount strains circulating cause new infection?

I mean offense. haven‚Äôt seen info you‚Äôre talking about.  initial comment ""Translated: really want hit 2020 projected sales.""

Your response ""They operate profit lots it.""

I appreciate taking time support response, even though meant to. eating in, government comping half meal. Afterwards started complaining people getting fat. November 3rd* election day. Sorry facts police like seems like important year ever get info right 6 million january r/coronavirus overreacting raw new case numbers, tradition like other... cellphone, smart watch credit card data readily available need us write name restaurant? People irresponsible, I'm waiting test results . gone walk dog non populated areas. could never hurting others conscious . Callous jerks. Jesus, guys contract tracing restaurants yet? Wtf. Yeah, wrote basically Fauci said. First interim results couple weeks, show good results groups could start vaccinated early December January. there‚Äôs also risk interim results show good results hoped. example case Pfizer; six vaccinated group found infected. would require wait five times many people getting infected. 

None expect even close 100% efficiency. Even numbers around 50% would deemed decent enough. low efficiency numbers large risk phase 3 takes longer expected. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. Fauci estimates December/January best case scenario, unfortunately scenarios. Throwing around numbers like ‚Äú2%‚Äù it‚Äôs going work setting people disappointment. van (not zombiepocalypse ready admittedly), right worry people see me. Psycho Something understand. COVID yet, get time.

Lockdowns make virus go away. 20 million front line workers essential workers huge help Yawn. boring. respect answer.

Unlike others, acknowledge possibility might risk.

A lot people would rather believe risk. choose believe want shut everything else out.

To me, see great benefit carry risk. 

To you, worth risk.

To own, good luck stay safe. Boomers nutshell. bs. family regularly see take pictures swathes people masks. Please stop pretending everyone wearing masks.

Herd immunity acceptable levels eventually happen, Spanish flu. obviously desirable outcome means millions die happens.. Technically did. mayor El Paso contacted Texas Attorney General, put statement Twitter exploring legal options, whatever entails.

For one, state governors lot leeway, fared better others, none well countries highlighted documentary.

This lot American people, American creed American individualism. value individual rights much higher common good, believe small government, COVID make suffer.

And anyone really believe Obama, US would done well South Korea now? don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve heard Second Halloween  going herd immunity.. quicker better far concerned... absolutely care many die. I've gotten much careful year. take risks used to. example cutting boxes open. use knife anymore. Scissors cut bad before. running, walk. wash hands several times day. know basically considered crime Nazi Germany? Jewish.

So answer question, answer yes. Yes, think reporting someone committing crime State considered authoritarian wrong.

You blithering idiot... !Remind 13 daya too! heartwarming. helps much see good among trash. home country struggled earlier virus strict lockdown 2-3 months. things control, single double digits new cases per day country roughly 30 million people. 

Then decided hold state election along campaigning things mess again. there's triple digit daily new cases second lockdown. 

Things really delicate even countries control.  isn‚Äôt though plan retain semblance intellectual credibility. 

Cuz that's important reddit. 

Either way, hope best friend. strange awful times. Stay safe, take care love, even don't. Fuck America let‚Äôs go balls California here, nearly 100% compliance.

That said, deeply unpleasant infection. started sore throat, awful headache, low fever &lt;101.5 chills. sore throat headaches stopped. replaced really bad joint pain, worst fatigue I've felt cough. Around day three completely lost senses smell taste.

ER, could hear going rooms around was. really sick people. Nurses phone ICU figuring order going send three people.

The day yesterday joint pain went away. temp spiked 102, responded Tylenol. one week mark, bad fatigue sense smell taste.

When talk COVID understandably focus deaths. every person dies several sick enough hospital many less sick home. also relatively fortunate people symptoms minor ones. (If play rules, people self-isolating, are.)

My husband fortunate: employers provide paid sick time everything need hunker couple weeks. also great health insurance.

It makes feel awful think many may lose jobs can't go work take sick time, forfeit pay can't afford without. also living situations illness put others risk. afraid seek hospital treatment may need. experience like strips bare brutality economy we've built. dismissive reckless attitude many shows ugly side society.

For time being, area enough hospital ICU resources handle COVID usual things treat. think going like long. New case numbers hitting new highs every day people wind hospital several days. ICU patients require weeks treatment. areas - like El Paso Hidalgo County - already reaching hospitals' limits. believe Utah upper plains states too. fear less month that's happening country. disparities exist everywhere, mostly rural areas playing fast loose.

Also, example, Toronto dealt SARS 1, people board covid. However, urban area, harder prevent spread.

Meanwhile rural areas, covid lurks surface, really spreading quickly, certain percent population it, explodes. Fly country, we're thumbing noses this, less individual level.

It's basically random places playing fast loose explode. curve kicks in. worst death rate, really.

The GOP still playing politics ICUs almost 95% capacity. ya'll, stay home. Well one thing good US way ICU per capita Europe. nailed it. reactive mode, denial mode, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt scare public reality facing‚Äù mode start. Counties proactive proved battle pandemic.

Oh, buddy....that's entire plan nutshell. Yep. work surgery seriously don‚Äôt give fuck us. treat em better walk?

Basically, keep playing chicken inevitable outcomes acting shocked happens?

People go work hospitals full. Period.  dentists taking extreme precautions I‚Äôm sure well. Best call. far seems like haven‚Äôt really tracked outbreaks dental offices, I‚Äôve read least. bigger risk employees since you‚Äôll one without mask. Yuuuuuup didn‚Äôt expect history repeat soon... Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton jail, kept several years Well US tests 1.5 times per capita Germany so... Yeah that. going need get one shot. going need wait 2-3 weeks. going need get second shot. going wait another week two antibodies build up. feel like invincible.

Make sure pay attention actual time periods vaccine given try cheat them.  Space force silly name. Yuuge success !!!

Without support government, we're going accept lockdown measures put 50%-80% places permanently business, leave millions without jobs develop new skill sets can't simply move another business within industry. Downvote want, stating facts.... Exactly. know treat better, dependent healthcare system. someone needs care can‚Äôt get system capacity, death rate goes back up. Yes, maybe approved only. Nobody said implied it. What's missing data segment, analyzing available data hard consider there. voters completely unfazed big government telling local government do. bizarre.

This atrocious - worse come strong action taken quickly. brother's upstairs tenant paid since May can't evict.

Quick google search bunch articles say ""might"" start sending patients Portland Seattle 10 days ago. delusion Corbyn fans ever thought competitive. apparent anyone idealistic Labour voter campaign would never gain traction.

Labour needs complete overhaul electability, always poor candidate. 'media Corbyn' line excuses pathetic papers many, many flaws politician. Pie sky unachievable policy aims blended uncharismatic leader. Labour might much better without Corbyn, really worse. Saying Labour voter held nose voted him. I'm surrounded Labour voters really, really bear Jeremy Corbyn care less media narrative. Good point. Fuck lives saved workplace regulations! sound like child.

Oh? now? always war Eastasia? thing Louisville, KY. grandma fell hit head pretty bad, wait 6 hours get looked at. rooms full, almost thought waiting car avoid people. newer hospital never thought would busy. So, think - assuming there's grand globalist control scheme - Trump GOP would meaningful way? Worldometers says ~91k right? terrible Bran would prolly throne GoT continued, he‚Äôd still upgrade Trump üòÇ See tomorrow headline cause massive problems own, but, still.

Why acting like say would cause massive problems ***literally*** said would cause massive problems? initial COVID-19 vaccines prevent symptoms become infected coronavirus rather kill virus itself, Anthony Fauci, MD, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said Yahoo Finance Markets Summit Monday...  strategies wearing face masks, social distancing avoiding large crowds important preventing spread infection ‚Äúquite time,‚Äù Fauci said.

The management expectations starting.

The vaccines development vaccines sense laypeople tend think them, i.e. preventatives.

Rather, stop gaps. Harm reduction, fix.

You still need social distance wear facial coverings, even get jab.

You'll less worry get infected, could still infected still need make efforts spread infection.

Judging many comments posted subreddit, many counting on. think underestimate resources state like China summon wants to. Brilliant suppose, seems like quite stretch imagination. 

The gardening thing got quite overblown twisted. live Michigan currently, could still buy anything needed smaller local stores. 

Most people blowing ones chant local. 

On community facebook pages local greenhouse owners fit it. Meanwhile diverted walmart gardening them. Murdoch monopoly made sure there's thing free speech more. like there's thing global warming, virus fake Trump best man job. Avoid politics. prevent infection portion reduce severity know he's trying help, really bad science. hell indoor dining still happening basically November NYC middle pandemic...? happened March April, given strict Cuomo was, surprised. ketchup became vegetable Yep. regional. live isolated, rural, small-population county everyone extremely careful masking social distancing. mask rates 98%. We've 32 cases total since March none even needed hospitalized (possibly evidence masking, even home-made cloth masks, offer level protection wearer reducing viral load exposure?)

It's totally dependent local behaviors. Regions counties cities mask use distancing high faring quite well. areas, masking rates drop 85%, faring poorly.  thought could get amulets Diablo. live Ohio update weekly guidelines stage county in. Last week nearing level 4(the worst one). morning(updates every Thursday) Fox 8 put article saying Cuyahoga County(Cleveland) level 4 guidelines involve 7 metrics county within guidelines(cases per capita, tests positive percentage etc.) 6 7 it‚Äôs considered level 4. However, also reported Gov. DeWine announced yesterday wouldn‚Äôt add restrictions level 4 counties let counties decide. Then...he held press conference announced counties level 4(even though based established protocol), longer counties even considered risk entering level 4(even though they‚Äôve gotten worse since designated way last week). say, short, no, there‚Äôs lockdowns coming, least Ohio. Doctors commenting. sure mean? think individual hospitals told workers comment, government. least that‚Äôs recall. Week Virology, Dr. Daniel Griffin giving reports outbreak every Friday beginning. know doctors commented well. 91k counting. Although unfair, would still benefit everyone. Right poor jobs, increased risk. least lockdown nonessential personnel would reduce risk. mean, look voting trends globally, I'd disagree second part. Conservative policies certainly causing leading cases many countries, special shout countries whose leaders questioned fascists, mean conservatism dying seeing major threats 'confirmed infections'. scale testing reach ceiling. \*thats i'm suspicious world deaths numbers per day btw\* Lmao probably adjust population evidence states *fifty individual governments 50 individual territories, lumped together simpler think unitary country hundred cities outbreak cycles.

FTFY Australia conservative government though I‚Äôm sure plenty people agree everyone wear masks, don‚Äôt agree mandated Worldometer us 91 k, maybe tomorrow Saturday would close 100k Mainland China really *that much* mask-wearing culture. 

It's common West, like Japan. 

China better primed start wearing masks to, doubt real effect early days people knew going on. stubborn comments pretend normal *just* around corner refuse distance past X date fucking exhausting. US continually shattering COVID records, get back reality knock delusions. 880 deaths ""It 99% survival rate!"" crowd. horrifying, pun intended. Yeah, ""wear masks everything internet forever"". whatever apocalyptic wet-dreams doomsayers having. - New cases: 88,452
- Positivity rate: 6.7% (-0.7)
- hospital: 46,095 (+1,050)
- ICU: 9,208 (+174)
- New deaths: 1,049

The hospitalizations seem increase every single day. helpful resources depict hospitalization surge:

[Total currently hospitalized broken region - broken region - **per especially per capita hospitalizations Midwest. Fellow Australian looking in, tough going particularly VIC people rarely going arms wearing mask..following lockdowns etc.

USA much propaganda politics involved get state ""normal"" anytime soon. 

As running course, Think there's many cases people catching COVID19 think current run course approach ideal solution 91k cases.

jesus god... entire segment American population incredibly selfish stupid literally care anyone else. care themselves, affects personally, virus exist them.

Sorry, wrong. Reported misinformation. order regularly. Italian Spanish lockdowns long hard look now. even talk Phillipines Argentina. long hard lockdown useless without longterm, efficient mitigation methods. There's word ""unprecedented"" again.   friend FB complained entire pandemic people following social distancing, pandemic caused job close, etc.

Americans acting disease mortality rate, imagine black president told couldn‚Äôt leave homes wear mask virus wasn‚Äôt deadly like H1N1? called question efficacy mass testing events, noting patients require multiple tests time return positive result.

All PCR test tells whether virus. may seem COVID despite infected, symptoms, PCR test confirms diagnosis.

Regardless, epidemiological standpoint, whether symptoms, knowing infected important allows spread disease tracked. che cazzo dici??

Thank you. fun ways construct tautologies check almost stupid UK government done. Crusaders crosses shield. Nothing changed ultimately ethnically, religiously, culturally diverse societies prone unrest collapse. take broader view kinds situations. look societies basically boil warring tribes fighting one another levers power, nothing eventual tragedies yet unfold. like that. Politics difficult ugly enough without adding kinds division baggage. would much rather empower tribes self-determination self-rule. Obviously, end conflict, certainly prevents particular kind inevitable pressure building. People make better neighbors roommates. 

I think treating people differently holding different standards fosters resentment anger. counter injustice injustice. guarantee digging reprisals. escalation, resolution.

Humans predictable bad outcomes seen adequate forethought. organize societies deliberately try defuse limit tensions conflicts. That's look it. lot problems appear unnecessary self-inflicted. sad thing me. see across america.

The anti American sentiment subreddit gross. people always fear future, hear people say ""we'll never normal...."" one day look around normal outside.

you could look actual data 1918 (highly recommend documentary youtube couple years ago) compare worst case scenerio projections today. trust me, 1918 worse worst nightmares yet world survived us remember 1918 pandemic school Since cannot follow detail everyone's testing strategy, prefer use statistics less prone affected human activity. We'll see deaths follow increase cases. far Florida looking good. sure?  Could well be! Like that's gonna change certain people's minds? That's count deaths. include suspected covid 19 deaths, ones confirmed testing.  think poster making joke actually calling high powered CEO Long good news since quite long time. wave think we're on?

Good luck getting customers scream masks time. metaphor stands TL;DR I've noticed trend errors all. usually examine ""hot"" regions, whatever regions 2 weeks growth, hard region grow exponentially whole month.

i run bash scripts downloaded data upload excel. 

I'm calculating every state every country every day slightly different metric: time percent pop positive. instance, South Dakota hit 5% 2 days, 6% 9 days, 7% 15 days, 8% 20 days. 

Experience taught look hottest regions, 7 day estimates pretty accurate, 14 day estimates 30%-50% high, 21 day estimates 100% (should 35 days more). Well, 7 day exponential graph (at rates) pretty close linear graph 7 days. would expect growing error rate like see 14 21 days. realize mathematically rigorous. 4 months this, I'm noticing clear trend, think related hot countries realizing hot either people take care governments intervene sure seems like linear rate would work better. 

You check yourself. South Dakota currently (10/29) 43,000 positive tests. model South Dakota: 

Exponential model:

Date | Pct | Pos cases
---|---|---
11/1 | 5% | 45151
11/8 | 6% | 54182
11/14 | 7% | 63212
11/19 | 8% | 72242

South Dakota growth week October 3300 4600 5000 7000. 
Lets assume that's 7000 week going forward, +1000 day. 
With 11/1 ~45000, rough linear model would be: 

Date | Pct | Pos cases
---|---|---
11/1 | 5% | 45000
11/10 | 6% | 54000
11/19 | 7% | 63000
11/28 | 8% | 72000

Now SD hits brakes cases per week go down, bets off. continue grow, im almost positive linear model closer. Dude fucked country level disregard happening state wide level us.

Oh sorry! meant entire post, focusing mind-numbing ignorance politician, inherently political. problem kind research we're willing fund. needed randomly pick 100,000 people NYC, give full serology tests complete blinded medical workouts, compare covid didn't. 

Instead small studies done severe cases, lead conclusions either clickbait useless. 33% 5% covid infections need hospitalizion heart swelling month, know nothing 95%. 10% 15% covid infections serious enough get tested still symptoms two months, know nothing 85%. People thought covid never pcr antibody test perform lower cognitive test people think covid. essentially three best studies have,

We know long term health consequences covid, trying find out. work healthcare field? think mean ‚ÄúTrump oppressed that‚Äù.  Yet applied US pandemic. UK Government policy: ""We follow science... except need get economy moving - discount eat out""

"" Cases increasing - what's scientists say, ""Short lockdown end September"" - No, must protect economy""

""Oh shit, back Spring - must irresponsible people taking precautions"".

Let's keep El Pasoans employed!!! accurate.

I live Texas. going college football game tomorrow, going gym tonight... safe way mask... still happening.

I think, people places, may hard believe return normal happening. experience far, normal starts feel normal really freaking quickly. literally don‚Äôt remember much lockdown period March April like.

It seems weird now, places think simple excuse vaccines available general public push things edge legitimate normal, regardless state pandemic time.

As said before, ends socially ends literally. Fuck. supposed move New York December terrified. didn‚Äôt realize getting bad again. someone actually living give insight like ground? people masking?

You think it‚Äôs good thing Pfizer taking longer time expected reach 32 cases?

I would suspect larger 50% vaccinated pool vaccine works on, slower results come since fewer candidates infection speak. already did, Governor expected bring back restrictions weekend 49,215 equal 246,000 US cases Statistics like average deaths per day? one up.

Or mean stats like ICU occupancy, well, dangerously high levels.   I‚Äôm wondering countries aren‚Äôt learning Melbourne. tried first implement milder measures weren‚Äôt enough stop case increase. wasn‚Äôt full lockdown absolutely essential businesses open, curfew 1-hour exercise (along mandatory masks) case numbers started drop. Anything less wasn‚Äôt sufficient drop R enough turn things around case numbers never got high Like really effective stopping airborne infections?

I‚Äôll await downvote studies.  True although considering yesterday's cases 10k higher day may see 100k cases soon next week clarify, run elected independently other, ticket. got backing extreme far right (think 3%ers, militia, bundyoids), likely candidate run governor two years. real piece work. sounds pretty goddamned un-american.

1) ‚Äúindividuals undergoing preventive health intervention (in case, screening) engage risky behavior assume infectious.‚Äù

Not risky weren‚Äôt tested all, likely alternative.

2) ‚Äúfalse positives‚Äù

A positive result rapid home test means need take another test. PCR ideally, 2nd rapid test might adequate (a stat savvy person would need verify that) odds wrong twice low. 

3) ‚ÄúFalse-positive SARS-CoV-2 results harm individuals, strain limited laboratory public health resources, risk long-range harm undermining confidence clinical public health efforts‚Äù

- Yes, people harmed false positives less COVID-19. Also, people benefit increased social economic activity made possible testing. Net favor routine testing.

- Laboratory resources spent testing people tested positive wasted. benefits testing e.g. students classes person huge. 

- Confidence public health efforts need compromised given proper messages. Rapid tests identify contagious people, infected ones, positive result requires confirmation. Yeah shit. billion dollars year could stopped dead tracks. Instead, lost (not even spent! Literally lost) trillions upon trillions dealing fallout pandemic. spent billions healthcare, million people died.

All cocky cheap pay adequate pandemic prevention. almost one party give single fuck people wish stay power rat fuck everyone.  That's crazy. less 2 million people idaho. 3k tests day 33% positivity means 0.35% state testing positive every week. reference US still 3% confirmed infected. Yeah.....sorry dude ... Healthcare affordable China much money crumbling right now. Maybe wait 50 years? superpowers fall. true.

That true either. grew ""keeping guns safe"" ""the ammunition different room"". Strangely enough, exactly rules force Germany. get semi-regular checks police (about every 10 years), make sure guns safe. Americans would freak abide rules. guys can't even regularly wear masks middle viral pandemic.

The question anti-science, anti-society, collaborationist thinking come why? really believe it, opportunity 'sock libs'? organised they, purpose? personally affected lockdowns, mask-wearing etc? things pushing towards bread line, no-one coming wash yacht? completely cretinous, merely deluded? done them? think pretty obvious I'm blaming Trump especially talking willing challenge precedents for. I'm saying federal government bad necessarily. I'm saying one misdirection funds inappropriate, believe reversed court. Federal courts, still going Supreme Court that[ allowed previous diversion also similarly challenged lower courts. court less lopsided. 

Whether bad irrelevant point **this** federal government's priorities are. argument there. bad reallocate funds Congress designated specific purposes. argument better excuse. people really take masking seriously?

Ok well that's simple. doctor arrested. called local police station made sign document saying spread rumours. arrested. matter many bullshit articles post, truth arrested.

Also simple fact responding internal memo sent local hospitals telling staff lookout new respitory disease. misinterpreted memo (not surprising considering eye doctor) sent message small group stating sars back. Also asking people sent message tell anyone, hardly work whistle blower. Unfortunately someone group shared much larger forum, person could maybe considered whistle blower, message said true.

All I've said truth incredibly easy check, willing look past click baiting headlines actually look facts.

Also, look huge statement bullshit claimed Chinese government covered months. anyone take seriously make bullshit claims. rising case numbers too, generally speaking they're mostly connected identified outbreaks successfully traced. I'm concerned point though, overlapping outbreaks become similar uncontrolled spread. Yeah ""here's Bible teaches love everyone even people wrong me. gun kills people actually wrong me."" Nooooooo!!!

Very true, hear [Just like think know scenarios happening much much higher frequency. ""That's ridiculous"", said. 

""There's way US would ever let get 100,000 new cases day"", said. 

:-D I'm playing, lol. 

The US clamped hard right original post, surprise delight, ended peaking July 73,000 cases day. Ironically, expected thing October, somehow refuse now. suspect quarantine fatigue time around. 

Also, model incorrect. assumes exponential growth, seen states rise exponentially new highs, point growth ""fairly linear"" state intervenes falls off. people idiots, state starts go crazy, certain percentage people start careful somewhat self-correcting.

When attack religions (in US christian majority countries), punching down. Sharia law isn‚Äôt coming US. many muslim US? Sure, minorities voice, voice depend willingness others back them. Alone, aren‚Äôt strong. Hence people unconfortable attack marginalized people. death rates across Europe remain low though. else gonna shoot devil? would like see?

People acting interest society instead self enrichment. 

How completely obvious point? quite clear expect really worried safety, getting plane pandemic, full stop. That's solution like restrictions current process.

There reasons people fly beyond control. people suffer selfish people going vacation refuse get tested properly, airlines refuse require tests?

This would like claiming campaigning Swedes really wish people neighboring countries would die make Sweden look little bit better.

I'm going report you, I'll let shit speak itself. Translation: want hear it, happening. Belgium cites too, countryside. compare state Belgium city. Wear mask, get less sick look happened Wisconsin election earlier year. nut job. People look death toll phone. shit maybe maybe not? shit really bothers living US. essential stores get limited sell. 

That's actually pretty good measure protect local shop competition. 

Let's say shoes start get old, birthday. Usually would go shop specialized shoes clothe new shoes jeweler buy gift SO. supermarket sell it, buy supermarket competition loose sale opportunity. wait re-opening buy it. fair competition different shop. 

As bonus prevents obvious easy fraud, like shop specialized shoes clothe hired backer people also get fresh bread looking new shoes, nice concept ? Congrats essential store stay open. needs Halloween real life horror show happening around world? states headed wrong direction. 
Much like exponential growth cases, betting see deaths follow trend too. 
The problem is, hard stop hospitals get full. 
Outdoor hospitals work north winter. 
So, like seeing countries Eastern Europe, hospitals able admit patients, thus sending home die. 
While never good time get sick, REALLY good.

Critically ill patients sepsis require intravenous administration gram amounts vitamin normalize plasma levels, intervention studies suggest reduces mortality. vitamin pleiotropic physiological functions, many relevant COVID-19. include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic immuno-modulatory functions. Preliminary observational studies indicate low vitamin C status critically ill patients COVID-19. currently number randomized controlled trials (RCTs) registered globally assessing intravenous vitamin C monotherapy patients COVID-19. Since hypovitaminosis C deficiency common low-middle-income settings, many risk factors vitamin C deficiency overlap COVID-19 risk factors, possible trials carried populations chronic hypovitaminosis C may show greater efficacy. particularly relevant global research effort since COVID-19 disproportionately affecting low-middle-income countries low-income groups globally. One small trial China finished early findings currently peer review. significantly decreased mortality severely ill patients received vitamin C intervention. upcoming findings larger RCTs currently underway provide definitive evidence. Optimization intervention protocols future trials, e.g., earlier sustained administration, warranted potentially improve efficacy. Due excellent safety profile, low cost, potential rapid upscaling production, administration vitamin C patients hypovitaminosis C severe respiratory infections, e.g., COVID-19, appears warranted.

I know population countries bachelor Geography people rarely know outside country.

And believe lot people either American Swedish It‚Äôs bad here. mask mandate one larger counties. There‚Äôs repercussions, lot people either don‚Äôt wear them, wear nose. hospitals, especially outside county mask mandate, severely overwhelmed. 3k Christmas, every day bad 9/11.

That's headed. don‚Äôt know. kind person refuses wear mask probably doesn‚Äôt want gf, mean government, knowing wearabouts 48/7. know it‚Äôs ridiculous, 99% shit hear red bubble. like they‚Äôre items shopping channel. I‚Äôm gun guy seems like slightly less cavalier waving lethal weapons religious texts around. Could county judge California thing? mayor, Sheriff, etc antimask CDC tells exactly methodology.  excess deaths nothing COVID-19. They're primarily summer pneumonia that's going around. Completely unrelated. /s affecting everyone, businesses. people furlough / reduced income pay premium subpar service?

Domino's charity. know, would least want literature governor know whether pandemic happening not. 

Them waffling whether exists seems like communist party form admission guilt. 

There may may comolete economic collapse due party's negligence. 

There may may 220,000 ish deaths result this. 

There may may plan reduce number fatalities ongoing

We may may following plan.

All statements make look better, make look cowardly able say loud going on. Ok...but current information simply shared first place, even needs configured differently. Punching up, punching down...I see punching. Equality, me, treating people same, different standards behavior. think charted dangerous path giving certain classes people license shitty villainize punch back. see anything coming except conflict. harmony goal, we've taken ""anything but"" route. p.s.



that flag hung

typical üò≥ Man, Japan really kicking ass!

Why can't people wear masks &amp; social distance? number deaths caused coronavirus likely exceed government‚Äôs worst-case scenario predictions ministers told second wave far advanced short circuit-breaker lockdown stop Newly released documents Scientific Advisory Group Emergencies, Sage committee, warns scale virus‚Äô spread throughout UK means number deaths could surpass 85,000 deaths predicted government modelling. Even 4000 insane Wait. USA adjusted 700k cases. actual wait someone tell me
I‚Äôm wrong 58% low. people need support this. Americans freedom contract viruses freedom recklessly pass others. people think masks strictly PPEs. context pandemic, effective transmission prevention equipments. wear mostly others yourself. sense, seat belt comparison 100% accurate. No, would silly thing do. close hardly spiking. agenda F.O. sure accurate dataset is, bunch counties capacity right now: following nurses Twitter descriptions working right ...COVID ICU patients right sicker than, every tube/medication/intervention &amp; unstable **very sickest &amp; unstable ICU patients pre-COVID**. instead maybe one patient sick, 5 10 20. US deaths per capita similar UK, Spain, Belgium, Italy  can't think last time went saw someone wearing mask.

That would nice. majority people see daily wearing masks. it‚Äôs okay mock attorney general gov, regularly fought rights disabled. go check studies say much less get back us champ. ""check covid 19 posts"" lol.  

your paid propaganda sweatshop buddies inundating place also bet. people saying also... check covid 19 posts. People say never really understand it? People come go, especially California. California gained 2+ million people last 9 years. Fuck, like 40 million enough one state? 

Source: google ‚ÄúCalifornia population‚Äù Sooner? like, March? September? Try Easter 2020... Back middle school could probably come coherent argument entire thread Yes, sets federal powers reserves responsibilities national government others states. 

The states responsible maintaining public order, health, general welfare though something called police power. lockdowns state local governments. Shanghai's current Air Quality Index: 42 Angeles' current Air Quality Index: 115 (Unhealthy Sensitive time Thanksgiving! R E P U B L C N Texas this, it‚Äôs ridiculous. countries haven‚Äôt positive case months know stay fuck home. Jesus Christ lmao Honest question: cases increasing NY everyone wearing mask? Eh, I‚Äôve lived whole life maybe I‚Äôve forgot... virus already survivability rate 99.4%, risk dying significantly reduced point living like longer. 0% risk never goal, deal it. ü§£ muh FREEEDOMüò≠üò≠üò≠ Know people literally died it, see bodies piled outside hospitals, constant sirens....I recommend it. Agreed, really like snow Taiwan island

So NZ (well 2 islands) 6-7 months, check covid 19 posts. New Years Day shitshow opportunity add metric ton gasoline already control fire. 

2020 gonna end bigger shitshow began. Shit, hope put people hallways like Italy refuse entirely, (which would death sentence.) I‚Äôm Hollywood take dogs walks I‚Äôd say 1/4 people sidewalks aren‚Äôt wearing them. don‚Äôt know think COVID doesn‚Äôt spread long you‚Äôre outside don‚Äôt want put go walk go car, it‚Äôs ridiculous. 2 year old son loves going walks me, can‚Äôt take anymore expose jackasses. Yes think that's exactly person originally replied meant say. framed ""europe poorly"" light instead ""asia well"" light. say thing.  believe data indicates average age death virus approximately life expectancy USA.  sure people dying earlier would go onto live 85 something , it‚Äôs foolish quickly pass this. Well right Capitalism. exposed CoVid patients

The guy hangin‚Äô brain... mean, what‚Äôs fuss? So... shutting essentially nothing everyone claim essential? news telling one thing daily observations aren‚Äôt anything dispute news. don‚Äôt know people getting sick hospitalized makes sense ‚Äúliberal media‚Äù blowing proportion. Love hear patient's view. Thanks comments. hit nail head perspective. Looks like commented didn‚Äôt even bother read article. 

For it‚Äôs worth sounds like big news, although puzzled it‚Äôs getting attention comes reputable institution. evidence suggests association viral dose severity disease. However, evidence relationship limited poor quality many studies, retrospective nature studies, small sample sizes potential problem selection bias.

The info linked, full qualifiers like ""may"" relationships yet understood. hypothesis. However replaced ""may"" qualifiers ""will"" information accepted fact. 

It's accepted fact. theory based sketchy data. misrepresented science. cases double every week, hospitals half full week completely full. Exponential growth gets scary ramps up. win far reaching implications. would mean government duty protect us instead kill us, supreme court ruled many times unconstitutional. shut I've heard far US. already challenged TX Attorney General. (Facepalm)

The worst hit place US might Hidalgo County TX. nearly 2,000 deaths population less 900,000. weeks, among highest number daily deaths TX county, despite well behind population. week, numbers dropped seemingly reason. suspecting may got close fabled herd immunity. (Death rate Covid estimated 0.6%, assume need 50-60% infected get herd immunity) similar phenomenon previously seen city Manaus Brazil. El Paso rest TX long way go get near Hidalgo Co's level. Hasidic Jewish communities. world's natural experiment refusing social distance. result, know unmitigated HIT likely 60-80%, like every fucking expert knows they're talking known along. yes. tested x amount people z amount came back positive. 31% tests positive. Sorry, but, China. tested 4.7mil people last week, 180 infected. Thats, math, 0.0035% positive. Thats broad testing looks like. 31% means dont test enough, much positive people tested day. Covid deaths stay low hospitals overload. requires mask mandates things. yeah end icu less likely die now. stays true icu beds. beds gonna die like before.

Well guess hospitals overloading again. Lol imagine risking getting covid go shit fest....üòÇüòÇ don‚Äôt know. Trump said times fine x date. Maybe 1927419374th time charm. Washington, DC. Since probably mid-May I'd say 97% people sidewalks wear mask properly, including little kids. think people included felt like jerk wearing one sidewalks since people well. Granted live high-traffic area country get official receipt present... cant swear bring legal team El Paso stay city week. Go tour hospitals. OP create title, read article, would see exact match article headline. first 2 paragraphs read:

 ‚Äî Two people attended President Donald Trump‚Äôs rally last week Gastonia tested positive coronavirus, according announcement Gaston County Department Health Human Services Thursday.  cases thought indication spread rally time, rather two independent cases among individuals attendance,‚Äù department said statement.
