Administrative rules usually go lengthy process ensure aligned agency's delegated authority. ""emergency temporary standard"" process way skip process essentially executive declaration. Wavelength: Light wave properties, much like ocean. wavelength distance wave peak peak. Radio broadcasts wavelengths order meters. Microwaves wavelength order of, might able guess, micrometers. Visible light exists order hundreds nanometers

Bandwidth: we're talking range wavelengths, refer range cover bandwidth. Visible light wavelengths 400-700 nanometers roughly. Therefore bandwidth 300 nm (though, typical talk bandwidth terms frequency simply 1/wavelength)

Brilliance: brightness per bandwidth. source dim concentrated tightly single wavelength ""brilliant"" source equally dim contains wider range frequencies. OP stated, single wavelength would infinite brilliance. single wavelength bandwidth zero. result dividing zero.

Synchotron: type particle accelerator generate high energy light. X-rays simply high energy light generated means. light generated synchotrons generally energetic X-rays. means shorter wavelength

Quasi-monochromactic: fancy way say almost single wavelength. Quasi means almost, mono means one, chromatic means uh, ""property light""? I'm sure root definition chromatic haha.

Bremsstrahlung spectrum: additional source radiation introduced radiation enters body target. Imagine running concrete start run beach. happens? slow down. Radiation also goes air vaccum human body, example. certain particles slow down, reduction velocity causes give extra radiation. wavelength radiation different wavelength source. net result Bremsstrahlung ""broaden"" spectrum. increase bandwidth measure. 

Kerma: measurement calculating much energy radiation air deposit human body. Bodies different air result transfer energy.

Dose: measurement tells us dangerous energy deposited human body is. location dependent. example, skin exists specifically protect radiation. reason, radiative sources give human lower dose held next skin compared ingested.     factor consider people vaccinated recently - there’s less “waning” people two-three months past shots. mask wearing made last weeks actually pleasant. would expect uptick winter country already vaxxed hopefully mitigates type crisis summer. new rules apply individuals received vaccines approved US Food Drug Administration (FDA) **vaccines Listed Emergency Use (EUL) World Health Organization**.

It’s 21+ show venue order city/county liquor license. wouldn’t know. Perhaps clear, meant say proof virus shedding covid . say possible. 

My point interesting note shedding ideas come incidents( bearing covid vaccines ) past. think also use ivermectin Nope. Deep South.  

But even follow visit doctor, stunned people would get mean spirited something like COVID. emergency cancer surgery location across town initial overnight because...........the local hospital full secure bed first.  That's terrifying.  see Travis Scott concert collapse thing still marvel lot people already forgetting COVID. top antibodies aren’t necessarily proven correlate long term protection. metric time point say “yup, tested you’re good” think cvs offers free tests schedule online. friends careful (this story took place pre-vaccine availability) went hospital deliver first child came home covid subsequently gave parents town help watching newborn. made rough. bet anything risk still lower vaccine. Actually, that. fun.

I'm quite willing learn experiences others, I'll take word. I'm curious, accepting issued Smart health cards? Seems like easiest way verify vaccine states, instead reading hand written CDC cards kids? know *just* approved vaccines them. pill people choose take protect deadly disease way choose take one every day protect HIV. evil, greed. wish could go back simpler time people lucky live ripe old age 30.

But 5-11 approved, perhaps inevitable 5 exempted, they've reasonable opportunity get fully vaccinated course.

If line, would block him. I'd let defensive lineman run right past hope aaron gets smashed. Fuck guy. There’s actual proof Covid, exists. mRNA vaccines don’t contain viruses cannot shed something that’s them.  understanding vaccines also improve odds COVID cases milder addition preventing death. agree dying thing matters.

Why people think tell parents treat children? given kid every childhood vax, and, year, gave flu shot, done since baby. Every day send school, think maybe he'll get sick bring back family. 

As parent, let tell - comments helpful. I've make toughest decisions ever children last 2 years. matter decision, get types comments. Either I'm vigilant enough made wrong vax choice. matter choice make, I'm wrong. 

When 5-11 approval came, slept soundly first time almost 2 years. gym isn’t large like 24 hour fitness LA fitness. don’t think large gyms requiring vaccinations. Also bunch restaurants bars checking vaccines cards since august.

Multiply cases reported 2x 3x Borders open leastthe younger kids get vaccinated.  I'm following caseload Germany intently, layperson looks like cases started exploding got rid free tests. Probably causation, can't helping.

In UK tests still free even vaccinated people using regularly seeing friends close quarters requirement work. husband tests twice per week work, despite vaccination tests caught multiple cases workplace (among vaccinated, including asymptomatic mildly symptomatic people), causing individuals stay home therefore presumably reducing spread. 

They work, they're cheap produce/distribute, provide peace mind.  Mask-wearing, smoking, cold way opportunities spread airborne diseases), shitting nutrition shitty immune systems bit trustworthiness government.  Yup Lab Contract test evaluate 1000 people 44,000+ people.  Except Singapore South Korea equally clean, mask-wearing, vaccinated. also far stringent covid policies.

But cases spiking. real question is, japan always exception?

Could anything fact South Korea Singapore adequate testing japan doesn't?

Not mention even New Zealand faltering right now. Sure, minor hiccup compared vast majority world, still strange, it? Literally every country seeing spike yet japan isn't. Even Russia's even hiding anymore. Yeah... no. buy it.

NA seeing spike cases. EU seeing spike cases. Asia, even countries well, seeing spike cases. Even Australia New Zealand seeing spike cases. somehow nobody bats eyelash japan's numbers exceptional?

japan quite infamous testing. look covid graph, peaks positivity rate coincides peaks cases. latest wave, worst one yet corresponding positivity rate 20%. literally stories coming japan people straight turned away hospitals get tested.

Let's use South Korea example. Similar culture (though would hate saying that), higher vaccination rate, slightly younger population, slightly lower population density. comparable countries South Korea even edge yet japan much better numbers. Anyone else think strange country known testing lot less better numbers? Remember, South Korea country pioneered testing tracing first place numbers far reliable.

Now make strawman argument, I'm saying there's mountain dead bodies they're hiding. I'm saying many countries world much better covid policies struggling there's zero reason think japan, next covid policies, well claim.

And people actually know anything japan, reason obvious: politics. new guy office scapegoat resigned numbers must improve, regardless whether reflects reality. Elections coming even incentive.  Pretty shitty, important context headline misleads:

- contract company, Pfizer itself, accounting 1000 44000+ participants phase 3 trials
- procedures sloppy, there's evidence anything malicious that. malicious maybe trying cover sloppiness. like overworked, understaffed lab making mistakes. want downplay, can't good science, smoking gun stuff see cited nuts. idea lung transplant feels like. Even less sure double lung transplant.  second double lung transplant five years? days, one say debilitating issues?

What?  Yeah, sorry. should’ve clarified. sides political aisle took issue two different things. One hated masks hated HCQ.

By “nobody” should’ve referred specifically people freaked HCQ completely disagree. Leaving aside conspiracy nuts fact point tremendous amount data vaccines aside original trials, **extremely** concerning. starters: regional director employed research organisation Ventavia Research Group told BMJ 
that company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed  
inadequately trained vaccinators, slow follow adverse  
events reported Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. Staff conducted 
 quality control checks overwhelmed volume problems  
were finding. repeatedly notifying Ventavia problems, 
 regional director, Brook Jackson, emailed complaint US Food  
and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired later day. 

1. company disregarded problems failed address them, fired employee raising concerns.  
2. FDA failed act. inspected 9 153 trial sites. understand FDA limited resources, larger average trial site appear failed follow  
3. Pfizer notified issues. mentioned issues documents submitted FDA, but: Jackson reported problems Ventavia FDA September  
2020, Pfizer hired Ventavia research subcontractor four  
other vaccine clinical trials (covid-19 vaccine children young  
adults, pregnant women, booster dose, well RSV vaccine trial 


It appears clinical trials contracted private companies incentivized cut corners, RCTs cumbersome expensive, clear lack government oversight various reasons pharma companies paying trials looking delay/cancel products they've already spend billions R&amp;D spend even money running ""proper"" RCTs. looks like serious systemic problem, something dismiss ""sloppiness"".  


Also, let point sad fact times covid vaccines main topic whole world, took YEAR see light day. Got source last paragraph? batted eye told wear masks.

No one, nope, single person issue this… /s true. leaves door open doubt, wondering proper procedure followed data collection sites. disappointing, measures prevent happening future, Whether funding FDA conduct audits sites evidence better quality control. data supports vaccine works enough real world speaks itself. Pfizer vax works, think right ignore bad science practices. imagine spending 30 years life helping people throw away conspiracy bullshit. way undo good ever done, lady. treat human ailments, one... lockdown would disaster, dont see one person actually adhering rightfully so, majority people got vaccinated Bundestag stressed additional lockdowns (again, rightfully so).

at point anti vaxxers die care, beyond infuriating hoping go awesome German Christmas markets year 😥 positivity rate relevant test certain point.

Just think minute. symptomatic people tested. Public servants, medical workers, military *must* tested. japan's testing low pretty much people tested. symptomatic ones told stay home, reported news multiple times.

Explain japan's positivity rate went insane 20% latest peak. They're obviously keen testing get real numbers out.

You say mystified literally makes zero sense based science japan well **claim**.

Seasonal changes caused rise pretty much every country world yet japan miraculously safe? Stop falling japanese exceptionalism  Ain't literally proof go forever?

We accept every winter thousands people die go back lockdown?

Somehow Korea's vaccination rate invalid why, exactly? AstraZeneca Jassen still FDA approved vaccines, regardless much ""research"" done. mention mixing vaccines scientifically proven boost effects, minimize it. yet somehow inferior japan's vaccines shown contaminated multiple Korea, currently false rumor Japan. Japan pay lot money test. Japanese people fed lie.

Why even mention this? relevant?

Regardless clear bias Koreans, simple fact japan's testing rates far Korea's. try use head minute. Testing less people obviously less representative population. mention symptomatic people tested. Medical professionals, public servants, military also need tested japanese numbers far diluted.

Funny single Korea. pretty obvious racist. already stated, rise cases **all around world**. please, go ahead make excuses japan pointing every country's flaws ignoring japan's. Interesting thanks. UK there’s requirements checks like idea much actually enforced.  Netherlands see highest case counts Bible belt. unvaccinated biggest drive behind rising case numbers.

To lesser extent also goes unvaccinated kids (under 12 ).

 Around 85% 12 87.5% 18 vaccinated. high also leaves 1 10 people serious disease vector. world racist? common sense. blind test Novavax get unblinded? combo work terms side effects any? guess they’re hoping get authorized year end used booster too. news Europe like 10 days ago… antivaxers happy read #PfizerGate trending almost every country lol big mess Italy/France passed. even list essential medicines. 

For curing *river blindness*. letters covid, distinctly un-covid like. also caused parasite virus, makes sense given ivermectin used treat parasites. already late, worms got wanted. time third dose everybody since 2 doses cover 6 months. 5 million? many, then. *begins rearranging ass chaotic, random order*   Though antivaxxers claim giving ivermectin instead vaccines that's cases still get covid19.

It lower chances hospitalize.

This imply get covid19 pass around... 

Which go whole point trying get rid covid19.

I'm kinda slowly thinking going endemic. i'll wait smarter people clarify position. Regardless endemic not, negate indirectly pass kill somebody.   universal studio amc theater like high mask compliance.

Like majority people around universal studio wear masks full on, even walking about. nice. It’s hard feel normal university restrictions things like guests, signs close people every feet campus, testing weekly. 

Plus it’s LA County, masks worn indoors. There’s huge difference mental health home NJ school LA. It’s crazy. 

You’re definitely right though, completely agree it’s time get back normal. booster awhile ago anyways, since Novavax trial, eventually got J&amp;J dose get vaccine card well.  club venues I've gone enforce this. ones run insomiac, clubs ktown, etc.. Even EDC escape covid19 check rapid test.

The security dude asked ID vax proof match name ID Vax proof.

Before anybody go say fake whatever. care. something better nothing. 

Honestly, friend friend anti vaxxer small inconvienences causing dude get vaccine. US? Vaccinated? Got booster? get back life.

I posted link day real world J&amp;J study, supposedly least effective vaccine, conducted months concluded like 73.6% effective read people actually even got sick couldn’t even conclude statistical rate death breakthroughs. Welp, better get back chlorine enemas, guess.

/s

DON'T probably true.

With R0 6-8 Delta events hundreds fully vaxxed people (~around 65% cut transmission) without distancing masks, still get Rt well 1 measures place.

But that's problem bc still many unvaxxed people, get infected later chain clog hospital beds.


I see two ways out:
1) drastically push vaccination rate (which possible without mandatory vaccination blistering fast booster campaign)

2) 2G+ big events possibility distance (vaccination negative rapid test required enter)


But knowing politicians nothing late get another lockdown.     See: Wakefield MMR paper.   crazies FB claiming Ivermectin  hopefully!   Lately strong foreign money spent country sentiment though hence attempted Olympics PR travel Japan. People mystified too, Japan testing less. positivity rate 0.4%. know people saying Japan fewer cases testing enough, would still lot sick people going hospitals. read interview doctor saying summer peak seemed like everyone tested Covid came back positive everyone comes back negative.

Now, people eligible extreme poverty get free lunches, fill paperwork sometimes difficult parents. get reduced lunches. And, kids must go different line everyone knows poor. Also, many families affected pandemic can't afford food qualify free lunch. Oh, signing free lunch program cost school anything. paid federal money.  Canada needs this. end everywhere. 

Eventually enough people get it’ll become endemic. Life go back normal. okay this. freedom chose idiots. 5% hospitalization per case rate people never COVID vaccinated, 1% death rate, cost (mortality+healthcare) every new case $50-100,000 range. Obviously cases ""acceptable"" metric.

With 5% hospitalization rate find number daily cases hospital beds strained/run out. metric somewhere 0.01-0.05% population test positive per day without hitting thresholds. course, exceeding raises 1% number, really higher mortality cost (and likely even bigger healthcare savings).

Let carry *us* fucking change. I'm sure covid tracking works there, US they've seemed pretty reasonable. phone uses Bluetooth grab number every phone within certain distance logs locally list every number met when. location data stored. someone tests positive, number date added list server everyone's phones check. phone saw phone within certain amount time testing positive, alerts get tested.

There good news. multiply mutations get That's perfect analogy exactly felt. ""good"" sick. annual flu shots thing here

Interesting, that's definitely case here. messaging everyone get flu shot, should. majority public high risk, reduce transmission *are* high risk. wanted share odd experience, find anything online this. boyfriend (we live together) went small get-together (7 friends) Halloween weekend. fully vaccinated Pfizer since May/June. people get together vaccinated, apparently one person not. Covid. tested positive Monday. boyfriend developed symptoms Tuesday (congestion, sore throat, etc). boyfriend also low grade fever, not. BiNax tests home, took (Tuesday). positive, negative. Two friends tested positive Wednesday, vaccinated well, tested home Thursday (negative again). boyfriend still tested positive.

Tuesday-Saturday symptoms extremely dry cough sore throat, aches, sinus congestion, headache literally never left, fatigue. boyfriend symptoms me, though slightly worse, plus low grade fever lasted 24 hours subsiding. boyfriend also lost taste smell Wednesday, however not.

Cut today, \*did\* lose taste smell, feeling much better aside that. Much less congestion, throat longer super sore. Energy back. Boyfriend also feels much improved today.

I never tested positive, though I'm certain it. 3-4 people close contact positive including boyfriend sleep beside. talking mom (they live hours away actually spent time person lately) said weeks ago dad's coworker (they spend lot time car together) tested positive, days later dad displaying symptoms tested negative, thing lacked fever.

I wonder \*not\* fever somehow lowers chances getting positive Covid test result. I'm medical professional trying allege anything all, wanted share experience find super strange! saying make sense.

1) talking COVID vaccines. talking vaccine.

2) mRNA vaccines made using eggs.

3) mRNA vaccines share equipment vaccines since manufacture methods different.

Yes, people reactions mRNA vaccines due eggs.  agree. rate matters. It’s basic math. I’m envious. terrible muscle joint pain second, bad, damn muscle joint pain third too. Eh, I’d every three months meant don’t transmit family. Small, SMALL price pay health.  semi-lockdown ended regions record level new cases daily deaths. cases deaths semi-lockdown. 


Still less 35% fully vaccinated. 


I cannot see Russia reintroduce stricter measures last week. Last year peak late December. low fully vaccinated rate high numbers see peak come sooner year. Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, etc low vaccination rates (30% less). countries still anti-vaxx folks (UK, Germany). Relaxed preventions (ex.

People choose put others risk catching potentially debilitating virus probably *should* feel shame. remember seeing average reduction hospitalization hours, days. fell \*entirely\* within reasonable margin error. 

Merck knew actual, real live therapeutic works, showed great promise. wear masks.  I'm sorry hear sucked ... OTOH, got shot (and flu vaccine time) 0 side effects ... vary lot. Many (most?) Americans get flu shot every year, even though also side effects some.

Also, yet know whether needed every year; might, might not. are, hope figure ways reduce side effects it, reduction may social, rather medical :). take July 5th Vaccination Day, something. soon six month threshold passes, I'm getting mine, even though technically meet conditions.

See, I'm married someone *does*, that's close enough, like CVS asks questions second dose was. No! sick symptoms something, stay home!  Successful according who? don’t good numbers china. 57% lower 95% effectiveness, that’s falsehood. Brazilian study. know one authors Chilean study, pre delta, even don’t believe numbers holds that’s boosters. Even efficacy low compared standard ARNm vaccines. That’s falsehood 
Also antibodies drop fast don’t lot info cell response 
Maybe inactivated virus vaccines place younger population, don’t think used 50yo. GOOD read thought, wait, third doses available *anyone* 10 months already? year went fast.

Obviously people studies, got earlier, knee-jerk reaction. Shouldnt covid replace flu since competing it? ( course decades maybe knows, me) much wanna bet CDC recommend booster shots December US already middle winter wave? 

And could’ve somewhat avoided, FDA/CDC recommended boosters months ago, already ample data supporting boosters. course, (mainly FDA case), taking reactive rather proactive approach regarding issue. Vaccination rates varied great deal country country even region region inside countries, best guess far lockdown mitigation protocols last year worked okay, B.1.1.7 variant tool hold Europe spread like wildfire, variant already sortof okay protocols massively performing, far European countries ramped protocols enough mitigate spread end last year early year.

If personally evaluate job increases risk getting vaccinated would benefit around you, eligible. reason, boosters crazy effective far. Pfizer reported boosted people 95% less likely get infected 2x vaccinated people

see there?

surf Reddit 1903 death headof anti smallpox vaccination league. 

he used tell people kind BS smallpox lesser intellects country, irreparable garden good knows many people families, died smallpox. 😐

the anti-mask thing height fucking sociopathy -literally. Lol thanks. asking authoritative sources opinions? think info #1 scientist right (we models stuff, quite know, also, define enough what), #2,3,4,5 political issues :)

About opinions, order stop visiting /r/coronavirus, #1 I'd love see 90+ eligible population, would get us 80+ total ... #2, 0 definitely acceptable :), I'd say 10K/day, ideally 1K/day weekly average, #3, multiply #2 10? (cases, hospitalizations, right?), 

For #4, mean endemic? give it? hope never :). stops problem take appropriate measures? USA (and developed countries), gradually 2022 ... guess answer #5?

Keep mind see 'never wear mask', much less 'no vaccine mandates'. vaccine mandates different sorts many illnesses; see mandates COVID vaccinations staying forever-ish, get shots annual exam. see new building codes ventilation indoor public spaces, maybe different restrictions building capacity? pay bills caused it”

Vaccination stop spread covid, merely prevents death reduces symptoms virus, die.   They’re highest paid world. I’ll goddamn don’t Joint medical decisions US citizens already pay covid bills? Regardless vaccination status? gotta find line effectivity efficiency 

And wasting money Minigun efficient Exactly. Take vaccination rate account rate unvaccinated people going hospital higher. Plus likely unvaccinated people spreading vaccinated oeoole. ex-friend like this. told get vaccinated, like ""no, trust it, pointless, I'll mask like I've always been."" 🤦‍♂️ mean like checking underage alcohol tobacco sales nightclub entry?

Of course countries interact US...thanks pointing obvious guess? take away anything fact US fucked someone ELI5 main cause surge Europe is? remember seeing countries like Spain Portugal high vaccination rates, case European countries? Yes people selling it. going search Mike sold Joe card corner 3 weeks ago Mike long gone issue there's federal proof vaccination.

Well, parenting plan say medical decisions? answer.  yes, they've prosecuting. take seriously follow arrests criminals got on.

i know anyone would believe otherwise, they've getting doxxed platforms pretty regularly... problem people buying \*equine\* version titrating down. 

Yes, human version sold, valid reasons, people live rural areas buying cheap equine version people calling poison control about, least Oregon.  


Under proper medical supervision, using human version, almost impossible make sick hospitalized. course, anything except kill parasites. Agreed. I'm getting booster today - pretty much guarantee there's gonna big push get boosted holidays, CDC gonna suddenly update what's obvious many nations months now. It’s racist all. also don’t think building US-Mexico border wall “racist”. 

But applying logic woke people US border policies, Japan’s policy certainly “racist”. Wishful thinking. people blame literally anyone blame talking heads. FBI care average Joe using making comment. selling may like third shot series like many childhood vaccines confer long term immunity. may even third shot required optimal conditions 3-4 weeks first two nearly long enough. Fingers crossed 3rd shot charm boost every year.  actually, felony FBI going (many doxxed platforms) He’s looking Israel vaccination rate 80%. people vaccinated it’s surprise hospitalizations vaccinated people. 

**What matters hospitalization rate groups. could looking 20% hospitalization rate vaccinated people 95% hospitalization rate unvaccinated people enormous vaccinated population you’re going vaccinated people hospital even vaccine clearly working** Oh, foreign *money* different foreigners haha. Money always accepted :) Moderna better data 2. I’d bet remains better 3 that’s based nothing gut feeling bet wrong 6/6 NFL bets yesterday… felony, fact. FBI enforcing it. decades making. fact fair help us ICUs would get full non-COVID emergencies can't get treatment... It’s easy. It’s highly unusual ask specific person. article jumping pretty major conclusions think backed existing data. starters one third shot 9 10 months ago, they're projecting antibody levels road taking projection inferring means protection. know high antibody levels good protection know exactly required prevent infection severe cases, there's story antibodies one knows exactly full story decent theories. 

Also referencing leaked reports, unnamed health officials, without presenting leak data kind confirmation health official is. 

It feels bogus I'm hopeful pans out. Good! know places like CVS Walgreens also don’t care don’t ask proof eligibility. Honestly people eligible anyway, CDC hasn’t made simple clear find out. It’s clear since data started coming Israel etc booster needed shouldn’t accept dying probably hospitalized good enough. don’t supply problem brainer approve 18+. looked around? America full them. Started 2021 waiting first shot, ending waiting third. Hoping 2022 something covid, plotline getting pretty repetitive. Oh PLEASE.

Because Reddit already decided anyone inject immediately without question racist terrorist. 

This throws question entire, recently constructed, reality.    contraindication CDC lists allergic reaction vaccine, good. vaccination site also discuss questions doc present. every policy getting vaccine? getting antibodies. get virus fight immune system makes antibodies positive test also prove that? included well? got exposed 4yo son. vac'd was/is young yet. swab test little kid misadventure. would interesting - disappointing comparison data looked good resources track number children (5-11) vaccinated ideally data side effects/adverse side effects?

We'd LOVE get sterilizing durable immunity forever, that's cards, it? best get right relates infection high antibody count. That's achievable boosted immune system. Antibodies going wane there, that's works. Dave Blake's weekly thoughts: 

The good news, hospitalizations still 1.0 rate. 

The OK news: Case numbers flat plateau.

The bad news: Spread rates 1.0 again, 1.01 rate.

However, point first week November 2020 spread rate peaked model last winter wave.

One month Gottleib, says February month cases, hospitalizations, deaths pre Delta levels.

He says state less 1.1 spread rate right make winter without much difficulty. Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico? prepared brutal one. Cool, thanks advice. Yeah, worried getting severe covid since first getting vaccinated, gonna really important even test positive either. I'll probably try soon. Honestly, Trump office would wager lot people would got vaxxed. made political thing, know particular side something head letting go...

It like made spark turned fire. lot harder put now.

The funniest part ended vaxxed spreading doubt still believe it. flu, tetanus, pneumonia shots cultured egg yolks, depending bad allergy may could go full body itching death.

Just dropping egg yolk skin results blisters, swelling heart rate going roof shot much worse, last tetanus shot 1990 woke hospital breathing tube throat. CDC likely update dashboard soon. go Scott G's twitter believe one recent interviews said CVS already booked 1 million appointments either week, something like that. I'm yet see single parent reported child lethargic feverish. kids getting 1/3 dose seem tolerating really well. Vaccines like medications. Take rabies vaccine example, 10 pound cat get half dose 1000 pound horse would get. make sense think it, amount rabies virus horse cat get exposed real-life conditions different. Good absolutely get booster today choose. qualifications verified, vaccine shortage.

Should choose get one? Based know, unlikely booster make difference life death otherwise healthy; first two enough. definitely difference cancelling trip going it. yeah, that's wise thing former president thought    made VR experience ICU them... would done right? union legally binding medical coverage hit 20 years service (9 go) spouse life. wife LAW waved medical expense day die. Union fought that. 

I absolutely worry medical expense family may children dropped coverage turn 26 respectively. 

It’s pretty fucking awesome Union. Everyone join/form one. hard mandate vaccines Germany? 

Well , we're place nobody position power wants bad guy. election run party wanted alienate potential voters restrictions vacc mandates. result , nothing hoped best . old government majority toothless new government formed yet want renegotiate positions explicitly anti madatory vaccines restrictions unvaccinated. add mess , also 16 local state governors want different things outride blame federal government inaction anything local level . 

Well obviously can't hurt poor poor persecuted anti vaxxers holding country hostage . mean actually dumbest? people live 💩🕳? Honestly, why? Anyone wants booster get booster. schedule appointment online specify qualification. single pharmacist cares check this. could, even wanted to. US higher vaccination rates though.   Actually, think it’s recommended condition. That's gold, Jerry! Restrictions make sense supplies limited. said, I'm pretty sure supply issue anymore doses. Depends province. Ontario must vaccinated Covid 19 placed organ transplant waiting list, Quebec recommended required, though talking making mandatory. ctvnews.ca/national/health/2021/10/15/1_5624186.html I'm still paying birth. think lot politicians still working assumption vaccinated people basically never get covid basically never infect others. vaccine advertised spring early summer. one makes assumption, people one needs worry unvaccinated.

Sadly, vaccines, good, good initially thought, politicians hate admit break promise ""get vaccine free covid restrictions"".  OK gone entire manufacturing process every covid vaccine everything used process? 

If shot nearly kills doctor tells get another shot would do? remember going lose job without shot.

This exactly problem going right idiots government making mandate common sense understand people CAN'T take shots, companies also stupid understanding, add idiots public attacking anyone says CAN'T take shot without asking understanding can't get shot. risk paying bills.

Trolling would trying piss someone off, Im not.

Theres things going- 

1- Like said, politicians one side aisle hammering home messaging getting vaccine. really cant blame side, they've messaging get vaccinated whole time.

2- internet media misinformation spreader. Many Americans media literate get confused see ""conflicting information"" know identify shitty ass sources.

What trying say entirely peoples fault misinformed. internet brings misinformation people alarmingly high rates people educated enough parse fact fiction. people legitimately believe, apolitically, risk profiles vaccine no-vaccine close debatable even close. Like said give monoclonals people time. partisan idiots, genuinely believe benefits getting vaccine(improved immune response, milder symptoms, decreased hospitalization, lower morbidity) outweighed risk getting vaccine(sore arm, chance flu like symptoms day). genuinely concerned phantom risks statistically exist significant fashion. Main issue Pfizer refrigeration temperature I'm guessing major part reason touched developing countries since beginning. Covaxin stored room fridge temperature. Bharat Biotech also scaling hard.

Only want ban everyone got vaccinated state too. mean you’re right ETS sidesteps notice comment process comes administrative agencies… would accurate say ETS action explicitly within Congressionally-delegated authority administrative agency, authority determine necessity of, enter into, ETS lawfully vested executive. one taking action Constitutionally delegated Congress itself.

I certainly understand someone opinion shouldn’t way go around process, matter emergency (I don’t agree concept, fathom argument it), don’t really see assertion executive fiat hold up. administrative body tool disposal wasn’t explicitly granted (or, judicial review, deemed necessarily granted due ambiguity law enables existence) supreme lawmaking body US.

Taking “executive fiat” logic step renders entire idea executive branch government, headed one person, completely moot. requirement functioning executive branch ability executive, granted authority act, act discretion, better worse. concern someone essentially “no one person power,” well, that’s something you’ll take Constitution, explicitly vests certain degree power one person. employer happen outpatient surgery December. unknowingly contracted Covid procedure, went home passed family. collapsed three days later tragically died hospital. company disbanded months later lost jobs.

That's much firmer ground. least invasive option possible, really easier effective alternative.

I know would end up. Maybe someone 12 year old would know. nasal swab, saliva sample, something else?

Russians know English. Help understand anyone worried unvaxxed. I’m concerned vaxxed catching spreading other. unvaxxed made decision live with. 

How’s supposed end vaxxed catch spread? Los Angeles word strict mandate used sentences. way see it, many business ignore it. Many options enforce risk going business many still struggling get business risk fine city keep going.

Got full adult dose. many many 11 year olds size/weight (or rather, actually size average 13 year many 11 year olds larger average). weight going taken consideration, would needed done adult doses too. evidence shows unvaccinated people carry higher load thus likely spread vaccinated people. it’s protecting also unvaccinated people could come contact including children. So, I’m requiring vaccinations. You’re free live, home. Businesses free say shirt, shoes, vax, service.

This tiny (by Chinese standards) village 270,000 people temporarily locked prevent outbreak. local infections, they'd back normal like 1.4 Billion Chinese people. 

If NYT article ""Life Zero-Covid China"" talked 99.98+% Chinese living since June 2020, it'd look exactly like China back mid-2019, Covid ever identified.

Or, want extrapolate extreme outliers, could look report ""Life America"" based hardest-hit county &lt;70,000 Americans, conclude America obviously hellhole. 

Or, could look lockdown Australia, talk horrible 'authoritarian' Australian government is. Pet peeve: Using word ""obviously"" abstract. conclusion obvious, need writing paper arguing point.  said GP first, sent specialist rehab. I’d go route anyone explain what’s going Vermont? cases per hundred thousand 46 think really high. don’t understand state consistently top vaccination rates, took seriously. think something amazing like 91 percent population first dose.

Reason I’m asking I’m supposed go wedding next weekend, it’s postponed twice already Covid numbers highest ever according Times. I’ve vaccinated three times, still I’m immunocompromised. looking forward trip first one since pandemic started. Similar lot countries, worth noting also low obesity rates heart disease, two key exacerbating factors COVID. Anti-parasitic drug. Seems close enough bothered distinction. outsider feel whole talk drug symptom deep serious issues US. Regardless function alien people passionate drug leaders told be.

As drug itself, could help bit, not, seeing widely used anywhere else I'd say even best case scenarios one hundreds drugs doctors throwing disease kitchen sink. important. Putting burden controlling vaxpass onto businesses doomed start. Nobody wants end angry confrontation calling someone possibly fake vaxpass. 

But even 2G people went 2G events, vaxxed spread events unvaxxed spread private contacts would probably enough keep cases high. Exactly suggest people immunocompromised? better option? Also low obesity low heart disease, key exacerbating factors COVID.

The vaccine exposes person spike protein requires body manufacture antibodies fight may happen immunocompromised person. 

The monoclonal antibody treatment discussed article literally injects cloned antibodies lab would ideal someone whose body won’t produce own. downside antibodies don’t last forever repeated. think that's brains work. They're ones woke research. They're convinced know better everyone, including doctors disagree them. One week one week exposure hundreds mostly unvaccinated people school.

I work thousands public daily. coworkers first became eligible staff would drive 2-3 hours get shot available 1-2 weeks earlier city. worth sense relief earlier protection.

I forties started sleeping much better two weeks parents first dose, even mine - responsible kind like kid. China issue northern border, hence earlier outbreaks Heilongjiang.  good!!! lot falsehood there. Chinese inactivated vaccines effective, reported NEJM, based study Hmm I’m seeing bunch say year end submission moment. it’s like 2 months approval that. either ignore say ""they"" pressured retract keep cover going. even know original study trust Ivermectin know works ""they"" suppressing it. irony politicians/media members spreading vaccine hesitancy ones want minimal government oversight, leads issues like this. leads vaccine hesitancy. know Koreans. Japan slammed cases summer, places like Tokyo simply could test everyone needed testing people told assume stay home. 20% positivity rate cities like Tokyo, everywhere Japan. live rural area able contact-trace test everyone needed tested even peak. cluster cases restaurant, two days free tests everyone worked restaurants. (Everyone negative) Unless system overwhelmed everyone covid symptoms gets tested. friend fever tested 3 times even though 99% sure covid. sure believe people symptoms still tested now.  
We still millions unvaccinated people. low case numbers simply result low testing, hospitals would still admitting lot people trouble breathing. no, hospitals sending home people pneumonia symptoms ""keep numbers low"". 


*You say mystified literally makes zero sense based science japan well claim.* 
\-There scientists hypothesizing one reason numbers dropped dramatically (to paraphrase) virus Japan mutated much died result. scientist really understand specifics... 

*""Seasonal changes caused rise pretty much every country world"" ...* 
\-Japan cold yet. still pleasant outside. Experts expecting rise cases December starts getting cold. But…but… Nobel prize! /s mean strategy could choose prepared better. Hospital beds already sparse hot spot regions.

Probably not. disinformation strong it’s apparent many, idea they’re wrong worse sickness death. found summer divert around forest fires.....so that's...good. reaction second shot? studies done back showed somewhat stronger side effects Moderna vs. Pfizer, likely due larger dose. doses much closer together, albeit still larger Moderna. flip side get somewhat durability Moderna.

Anecdotally mild side effects Pfizer shots. Mostly pain injection cite headache. decided yet booster get. Last year, took kid school asked wasn’t getting lunch bills school secretary told “There’s federal program that’s paying school lunches right now. mean, there’s thing free lunch guess now.” rolled eyes. 

And wanted say, “Is thing free school? employs you? socialist understand well?”

Fkn idiots. Idaho worst. I'd imagine that's going case near future. Doctors would prescribe pills definitely interacted positive person, advise tested every days, take pills unless comes back positive definitely symptoms. No, assume vaccinated.

I yet encounter someone get vaccine masks without required. I’m interested see happen companies go route making unvaccinated employees pay towards health insurance. Better every 6, much better alternative.
Thank God vaccines!
Any news efficacy Moderna booster yet?
My wife Moderna booster 2 weeks ago Saturday. think it’s likely insurance companies stop covering covid care you’re unvaccinated. 

In fact, that’s one thing private insurance could I’d like…. good job, private insurance.  almost like mandate control public health....  reason covid vaccine might need periodic boosters? covid mutates, even ever slightly vaccine becomes little less effective? simple questions would like simple answers. order pandemic end:

1. percentage population vaccianted? percentage adults?
2. number daily new cases would acceptable?
3. number overall active cases would acceptable?
4. timeline covid going enddemic?
5. see feasibly happening by?

I looking straightforward, concise information vague pessimistic attitudes like ""we'll see"" ""never"". cite sources, would greatly appreciated. referring fact another shot, right actual indication annual booster different flu shot. Exactly right. waiting two months actually delaying request business lobbyists get holidays. good look. absolutely true it’s dangerously naive think that. There's 'free free' insurance, vastly different financial situations hospitals patients medical advice-accepting people vaccine denialists using medical resources. good answer would insurance companies opt paying covid bills willfully unvaccinated people, really can't done regardless, since insurance companies operate individually could harm hospital funds.

Truthfully, dont know would implemented America, that's job either, I'm perfectly allowed enjoy thought antivaxx assholes getting form kick ass, even happen real life. Frankly I'm tired compassionate it, many people died needlessly one taken held responsible it. 5 year back idea track everyone constantly planning reasons (it's way complicated) get serious blowback recall (but really follow topic much). super keen one myself.

I think really depends whether plan track people places really. goal keep track every individual person went file name it, that's understandably objectionable. plan count number people go area travel certain route, much different. Yeah right... Socialized healthcare America... Ugh wish... never reality uninsured find facility agree bill federal government, pick tab, now. Antibody Therapy also free everyone, far understand. 

And know underinsured people fall, whether get assistance bills not. end ecmo, long term rehab facility, chances gonna fighting stuck significant bill. ended network hospitals completely overwhelmed regularly sending people state, whelp, chances fucked. insurance companies whomever billing insurance can’t collect anywhere. not-free not-vacx illegal get caught.

The scary part story cases discovered. would like agree, Healthcare human right would undermine claim think go get boosted

I waiting I'm technically eligible. Last night, husband (both us fully vaccinated since April) starting running fever I'm freaked out. wish recommended everyone 18! followed rules I'm 38 underlying conditions, wish already done it. 9 year old got shot #1 3 days ago. would stink made far, blow right crossing finish line. it’s write state health insurance

Interesting... basically winds written insurance companies taxes? Mainly recently necessary approvals. End July according media.

And focus remained vaccine prevention far cheaper. Ahh, makes sense already do, man. don’t pay taxes you’re dead. Got moderna booster Saturday I’m turning corner still feel like garbage. don’t see shots apart day day life sideline people days. one sign ruin weekend, take vacation days, miss pay every 6 months/year. I’m sure it’s possible, need figure reduce side effects. Lol no. insurance companies totally change game say didn’t get vaccine. charge whole lot more… Sure, get cost vaccine back, $40. Seems fair me. Except Currently they're charging $2,100 per dose US. little 100x higher vaccine dose US. correct use word fiat biased misleading? know understand definition? fucked honestly. especially Americans could travel UK, way around. post reply reply reply literally said unprecedented. vaccines require boosters. new.

Yeah… last summer. know 5 months everyone needs get third dose. long last? Nobody knows. Time tell. catch vaccine? Yes, die? Yes, transfer people? Yes. develop long covid breakthrough? Yes. Think fact it’s taking long convince people get 2 shots, third needed, probably need couple years get everyone board… sign ending.  issues today first dose yesterday.

My 8 year old pretty sore arm yesterday, also overreact getting sick etc. people get treatments? know many people gotten COVID, including many high risk none ever given proven effective treatments.  Right, implement America it’s already not-free everyone? Insurance companies put end pandemic America.

How?  Nothing free America think back SG mandated % different religions apartment block. like someone X religion moved probably someone religion could move in. Fairly sure means prevent echo chambers. kind like one.

Second moderna kicked ass, I’m taking work either way. hoping go fishing rather lay couch I’m LA went three bars weekend, three sticklers it. It’s definitely good thing I’ve experienced, strict One friends tried get booster, pharmacy website told eligible, even though according CDC, he's going go he's visiting parents Thanksgiving since walk clinics there. I've never heard case single instance exposure. Coivd cause illness single interaction infected person. Also first one real accident fully covered, rest negligences avoid. HIV? Whooping cough? Measles? sounds like new precedent I’d hope avenues aren’t available defeats purpose.   lol, Lemon? Crawl back CNN beg Pfizer paycheck.

Meantime I'll sick ivmmeta dot com real news. got booster Friday -- Moderna 3 side effects. would've flattened curve looong ago..    often people voting politicians oppose affordable healthcare. Well, Covid go away, acute. Look India Delta originated. much death also much immunity left wake. huge wave since. Covid therapeutics coming help can't/won't get vaccinated bad breakthrough cases. 

Think pandemics, ended without vaccine, why? Immunity infection. We'll get soon enough. can't imagine dumb/prideful/whatever choose die. 


Different world guess. suppress more. breaking point, they've kicked far, far road.  admitted TV Texas would blue year hadn't.  I’m getting phizer booster today, previously moderna.

This one funnier scenes picture can't decide actors.

I think insurance guy John Oliver.

And can't think would capable truly bring humour applicant role well. stereotyped etc.

I leaning towards Daniel Craig character Logans Luck. Damn good performance.   Israel's data great news zero COVID anti-mask groups alike.

It's booster restore immunity -- gets stronger longer lasting immunity ever had. 

Delta seems able sustain double vaccinated population, triple vaccinated. Immunity probably still wanes, looks like quickly. 

Of course still need see Israel's official report, feel overly optimistic say beat COVID vaccines (and boosters) alone, uptake high There's always GoFundMe. would love folks thoughtful choices; however, I'm sure really capable thinking through. may realize experienced irreversible consequences even then. recently got exposed Covid-19 positive girlfriend. lived together 10-days isolation. tested negative 3 times period bit after. wondering incident would positive effects antibody levels?

 
PS. (26M) double vaccinated received second dose July. smoking

Second smoke cause lung cancer respiratory ailments.   This. Universal healthcare universal. Even means treating people choose put selves risk. *and everyone rejoiced* Actions consequences. redditors speak would prefer everyone get vaccinated stay alive. everyone making wrong choices, expect rest us subsidize results.    American Healthcare System: Arguably Better Dead. child qualifies 5-11 vaccine. divorced ex don’t see eye eye things. shared custody. one parent anti vaccine do? No, push date back May 2020 person wanted vaccinated could vaccinated.

Vaccinated still get covid. still pay medical bills.🤣🤣🤣 insurance get treated covid US, stand good chance covered. curiosity, negative connection made tourists right now? Like ""Clearly tourist, might vaccinated, stay away..."" feeling towards people?

Went Japan honeymoon years back wondering things open up, would people get treated differently experienced?

Edit: literally tourists right now? Wondering people visiting countries USA. Yup. big old signs too. smuggle / sell illegal drugs probably world trouble get caught. Like Asian countries lived / visited really.

However past days decided kill mentally impaired guy maybe look bit more.

\-I- think general idea (remember chinese opium war heritage) something along lines ""drugs outside country bad"" (they treat sex toys way, executions ""bad"" despite tons sex shops making tons damn things).

With context opium wars observable craziness western drug legalisation around world coupled US diplomatic response drugs past 50 years?

As ""benevolent dictator"" would pay attention US state legalisation can't even get federal level would stick worked diplomatically culturally decades? many people prison US crimes legal?

Again though. SG citizen, heritage anything. kind like food really read history place went first time.  impact life though.  Six year old, zero side effects since dose Saturday.  Haha mean I’m generalizing course. honestly, think backlash US closed borders, land air, immigrants. Half US got pissed mere mention border wall, meant stop *illegal* immigration. go way Israel, one places highest vaccinated rates world, find place vaccinated people unvaccinated hospitalized?

Guess - go somewhere virtually unvaccinated people, ones hospital going people got vaccinated shitty immune systems didn’t respond well enough, caught variant.

That doesn’t mean anything. 

That’s like saying fewer asians white people world, go BumF*ck Maine, hardly Asians. better option healthcare ""undeserving"" it. long vaccination free accessible long exceptions people can't medically vaccinated ok time crisis capacity hospitals  Literally one ask. sign Well, best luck you. think work, encourage try folks see far get. optimal governing system would benevolent dictatorship.

First Pfizer doses started what, December last year, 11 months ago? there's 3 week gap 2nd standard dose. first people would gotten second dose January, 10 months ago. boosters supposed evaluated administered 3-8 months 2nd dose? That's whole point, tie cost catching encourages beating average adopting safer behavior

You probably care unvaccinated folks run greater risk catching weaker immune system / greater respiratory volume / etc, care that. average baseline either lucky not. heart, it’s speeding ticket. you’re good putting ideas together. shared evidence vaccine helps. see that?

Israel 80% vaccination rate. take hundred people. Give 80 vaccine 20 remain unvaccinated. people 24 vaccinated people hospitalized 16 unvaccinated hospitalized (60/40 split - like article) - that’s clear evidence vaccine working. **That’s close 25% vaccinated people hospitalized around 90% unvaccinated hospitalized. **

Most hospitalized patients vaccinated would mean anything wasn’t true population vaccinated. negative, person sucks i’m sorry.  Depends *having* spouse, yes potential ways it, although still situation you, unfortunately, aren't. gum illegal SG

As good vs bad news reporting, bad news sells, always see bad news reported (every airplane crash gets reported, never see 1M flights went without incident :) would follow similar policies regarding people proactive health ways. lowest hanging fruit would obese people, paying obesity related illnesses? Smokers? People live take out? People exercise? person causes car accident?

This completely new information me. think answer places USA basically ""when people tired enough accept certain rate death illness go back normal"". quietly happened already happening gradually large swaths country, even places took Covid way seriously. I'm New York, per Governor's Twitter feed NYSDOH 30 deaths 1800 people hospital yesterday. everything largely returned normal, masks much rarity than, say, 6 months ago (except subway, even I'm seeing folks without them). answer ends gradually, people quit caring, many people already happening since late spring. 5 ups able vaccinated wave people ready go back normal going build. not. Mandate penalties perfect answer.    Everyone chance get vaccinated months now. responsibility protect people haven’t protected themselves. Now, even little kids get vaccinated.

You’re trying spark empathy, there’s empathy millions younger people never much risk covid (one million chances serious complications young healthy people risk) lives torn apart.

If trying instill panic fear, opposite trying do. long take booster fully work?

(like initial vaccine didn’t fully work 2 weeks final shot) vaccinations last lifetime

After multiple boosters, many months apart. MMR? DTAP? one ask. wife immunocomprimised. doctor said get booster. That's list, it? matter. point, CDC pretty clear follow doctor's orders  six months since last dose? so, yes.

Otherwise, wait. six month interval important. Oh, is, it’s quite harsh. really wish approved recommended everyone first time. husband fully vaccinated pfizer back March started running fever covid symptoms last night. Unfortunately, infant 9 year old home us potentially exposed. Agree. today’s world, news media exists sell ads. It’s unfortunate reality.

That we're still telling kids get vaccinated three week interval close malpractice. know better. say anywhere comment eggs used covid vaccine? vaccine/medicine manufacturers share equipment may use type brand equipment share.

Also doubt know entire manufacture process every covid vaccine way knowing may compound may use used others.

I personally reaction covid vaccine yet know others mild severe reactions required stay hospital week told get another covid shot. got booster morning. asked either check yes something CDC website check yes anything second list. answered yes second list write underlying health condition. Walgreens employee didn’t challenge wrote. untrue. always suspected two initial doses, close together, would last forever. EVERY vaccine works similar way. vaccines three week interval - 8 weeks minimum sometimes 6 months.

In recent local report read (SoCal), county had, IIRC, 34 deaths such-and-such time period (a week, think). 27 unvaccinated people, vaccination rate 80%.

Calling disease stupid bit overgeneralizing, one things that's still largely true. *ashamed* catch it, I'm vaccinated avoid indoor gatherings much possible (and mask grocery store), majority people catching point are, indeed, stupid.

The tricky part conditioning statistics demographic.

That 27 vs. 7 stat mentioned? MISLEADING, aggregate whole region, vaccines randomly distributed. know vaccines distribution still skewed toward vulnerable populations, certainly one point. Thus, vulnerable people overrepresented vaccinated group, less vulnerable people overrepresented unvaccinated group.

Look *just* one risk level look per capita results get vaccinated faring even better overall numbers show.

Though, also worth noting hospitalization death rates reduced lot case rate. However, I'm sure *that* also statistical artifact. point, wonder become third shot primary vaccination sequence.

Most ""for life"" vaccines kids sequences months time doses. example, Hep B sequence **minimum** interval 4 months.

JnJ found booster, second shot produced much stronger response 6 months compared 2 months.

With mind, 3 dose sequence mRNAs 4-9 month interval third dose begins make sense. mean killing one person still lot. There’s cure stupid. look perspective. probably leaning conservative, thus little trust government. administration done horrible comes getting public trust them. flip-flopped many issues fumbling economy. right now, government trust worse ever been.

So Biden decides start implementing mandatory **mmmammandatory mamandatory** vaccine requirement, reinforces distrust even more. mention, mandate also completely unnecessary. Vaccines proven great stopping COVID deaths, anybody vaccinated give shit working people unvaccinated. Nobody gave much shit flu spreading workplace, basically contract COVID vaccine. Also, anyone previously contracted COVID level protected vaccinated, matter unvaccinated either.

All mandate create labor shortages, disrupt flow products, cause even inflation going right now. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

[CDC vaccine tracker &lt;12-years-old data displayed result vaccination trial data historical data subject change. Updated vaccination data 5-11 year-olds added COVID Data Tracker later week. lot tough questions unfortunately. math question, good estimates lot parameters. 

The pandemic over, endemic, year year R0 1.0, without unique measures put place handle different phases virus. 

Supposedly, immunologically naive open society, R0 Delta 6-8, puts R0 AY.4.2 7-9. 
So people immunities behavioral changes decrease rate spread least 86%. 

2 doses vaccines simply year waning. However, booster seemingly crazy effective -- US military study put Pfizer vaccine 2 disease around 55% effective 6 months. Pfizer booster trial put booster 95% effective 2 dose vaccine. would mean booster around 97-98% effective -- depending boost schedule waning dynamics, booster could make virus endemic without measures.  
There additional measures. 
People return pre-COVID behavior. Caution may increase some, effectively lowering R0 COVID.  
Natural immunity basically unknown -- studies kinda much protection previous infection grants, quickly wanes. endemic scenario, need know multiple reinfections affect immunities, definitely info. 

Mutations variant dynamics change everything too. sublineage Mu that's competitive Delta Colombia going get boost effectiveness societies rely vaccines instead social measures? Mu one antibody resistant variants, might suppressed current social measured strongly Delta is.

I’m sorry happened, sounds awful hope ok. Suddenly Brett Favre everyone's favorite Packers QB again. went way use word ""vaccinated"" told weaseling somehow, guess caught COVID relying that.

Then turned even worse. kinda does... people get hesitancy get shot avoid without health insurance. Others stubborn get infected, eventually...

Pandemic end 90+% people antibodies. Either vaccine infection, choice. Bruh

Me neither

What  wonder *not* fever somehow lowers chances getting positive Covid test result. 

The fever indication immune system working hard virus (or bacteria whatever making immune system respond).

A positive rapid test indicates presence virus sample.

A fever effect test. 

If immune system working hard, possibly get much virus boyfriend, going increase body temperature.

Some people get different symptoms. everyone loses sense smell, everyone gets fever. Oh yeah, they’re practically begging get booster! happen Canada, I'm Vancouver Island. saying proposed would probably see majority support like vaccine mandates travel, restaurants, work, etc. people welcome open arms realize maybe financial penalty would finally smarten people enough get vaccine already move away many restrictions. Turns still wear pants work ... even online meeting ... can't free :)

Hopefully wear pants pandemic soon :) freaking hate health insurance works way, too. saying stop studying Ivermectin  Hundreds thousands people already vaccinated available public. That's studied vaccines.

There always highly studied group vaccinated people several months ahead us schedule this. months see even articles booster effectiveness general population catches ""guinea pigs"" right now. pattern continue several years. Well parents pay failures worth spending money on. think white kids get helped. shitty family isnt worth lmao Got curious googled many people vaccinate flu year Sweden. 

 Found medical journal article december 13 2018. article record vaccination rates year. 65 years age rate 2% record (previous season 1,6%).

 like wrote virtually non existent. 65 years age however stats looks different. People 65 recommended take vaccine gets contacted offered it. 41,9% 65 vaccinated themselves.

 link article anyone want check source google translate something: Yes, never said otherwise  I’m fine wearing surgical mask indoors wearing one outdoors unless it’s crowded. would wear better mask that’s uncomfortable, existed. makes worried? Throw one car pocket, worry!

Is really uncomfortable? Find one not. Sore arm one day 11yr, side effects 9yr. symptoms sick are, virus present better antigen test like Binaxnow works. Otherwise, PCR best way go, would get one sounds like Covid. ""Are telling think someone myself? That's socialism! ain't gonna!""

That's pretty much response I've seen certain breed anti-vaxxer. It’s probably Milhouse Would say parents 1000+ parents already lost children COVID? obvious answer, too. reason handle sickness better someone immunocompromised -- immune systems prepared. Whether that's number white blood cells, cells knowing handle disease, result same. would beg differ, people younger 40 y.o. living rural area perfectly fine level English. Loads people get entertainment it, it’s rare speak well  Everyone get booster 6 months.

You mavens promoting vaccine hesitancy Fox news, Facebook acting connector theories. 

If anything, going wrong way. making think twice single payer. quite frankly body choice consequences. There’s lot reasons. Logistics big one. administered IV takes hour, pretty much hospital, can’t hospitalized covid receive it, requires outpatient IV set-up. Plus, requires healthcare worker reporting covid test results responsible care patient aware option eligibility requirements (which flux somewhat ambiguous time existed) knows recommend patient get patient place receive it. also requires patient desire ability get location stay hour, within timeframe receiving still effective. certainly would make time effort, everybody understands benefit circumstances able to.

Plus plethora potential hurdles disconnects. I’ll provide anecdote highlight one I’m personally aware of:

Someone know 70s high risk numerous reasons tested positive local urgent care center recently. urgent care center satellite hospital system based city hour half away. asked wanted receive monoclonal antibodies said yes. told would drive hour half hospital city get them. declined make trek. know near certainty hospitals much closer (within 20 minutes) monoclonal antibodies. time heard this, well recovery getting point wouldn’t helped much anyway. things would make one's life insurance premium go up, one paying choices.  avenues available unvaccinated COVID patients? could see bunch services taken away date. prevention case easy. it'd like broken leg skiing vaccine could get free CVS drove resort. Staffing major limitation, ventilators hospital space. can’t train new respiratory therapists nurses quickly. ideal person ultimately altruistic control would able answer questions. 

But actually exist. Weird, read title clicking positive perspective, booster provides strong protection least 9-10 months. Everyone knows boosters available long automatically assumed know provides strong protection least long.

Ahh Macomb county, home golden butthole. surprising. vaxxed ppl drop preventive measures where/when given choice. news flash; u still catch transmit covid vaxxed… weird hearing conservative relatives talking great vaccine free (the ones said took least) unvaxxed 2 choices - either die, pay good sum $$$ when/if get hospital 😂👍🏼👏🏼  …no? Great who? would people right set priorities “good you”?  secondary effects correct though?

Shame really many jokes STEERage class set ready go annoy co workers. give two Tylenols, tell drink lots water, **have call coroner morning.**

I almost spit coffee out. Also Canadian, live Seattle, forget much miss dry humour. don’t spoil medicine.... likely raise premiums unvaccinated. would normally agree COVID felt mildly sick day. it’s nothing worried I’ll turning booster honesty. Hope one feels obligated get don’t want to!  surprised professionals faking people's deaths get crazy high bills get usa. Thank god

Edit: damn, hoping USA sign-up questions places looked included asking immunocompromised, presumably that's condition getting full dose instead half dose. probably asked question signed asked get there.

That said, posters recommend, hurt ask confirm. Yep 99% never get caught, it’s easy get away drink? Use marijuana? job involves leaving house? ADHD? Depression? thinnest 26% adults?

It's pretty broad.

But remember, approvals based completely ignoring mild moderate illness. There's lot reasons want prevent those. that's want, evidence unequivocal, get booster. Medical care partially subsidised government Singapore. COVID became exception government subsidises covid patient's entire bill. instead normal percentage. IE get covid today, government pays entire bill. get cancer today, government pay entire bill, usual partial subsidy.

This move means unvaccinated person gets COVID longer fully subsidised COVID medical treatments. Good bot.  people hospitals vaccinated. throw unvaccinated then. Problem solved. true all, especially regard flu: fall protection threshold 6 months. That’s H1N1 pan09 keeps circulating: It’s new strain, flu immunity wanes.

Shit, we’re trying make RSV vaccine usual duration protection RSV infection 2 months.

Flu: Lol white children internet think they're going America 😂😂 Ha around went basic right Christmas, went home went Keesler. can't quite remember details.. changed something chant got yelling part yelled something different everyone else. weird feeling haha. American health insurance companies would heartbeat, ideological reasons, want excuses cover care. wonder pre-existing condition protections Obamacare would extend anti-vaxx nutjob, though. That'd bit irony.  Might turn last longer year… agree concept, decision could lead ever expanding ""exempt coverage list"" countries could use deny citizens medical coverage. could lead eventuality everyone would seek supplemental coverage form private insurance...and know they're choking medical bills like us America. Sore arm 12 hours so. really hyper. excited go back normal (hope happens them). 6 year old insisted wearing short sleeved shirt (inappropriate weather) show bandaid. side effects. anyone else downgraded mask use since receiving booster shot? previously wearing N95 indoor public spaces, I’m two weeks past booster, I’m fine wearing cloth surgical mask indoor look forward going maskless transmission levels low enough. revisit strategy situation worsens again, I’m significantly protected, might well free uncomfortable N95s now. think still are. it’s explicitly stated news said something like unvaccinated choice still tap existing funding arrangements pay bills applicable. kicker SG funding 100% guaranteed, hard get, got go many hoops, etc. vs you’re vaccinated, every bit covered. still offer option it’s difficult guaranteed. healthcare bills Singapore get pretty expensive.  Bankruptcy isnt good? downright presidential…. adding illustrate point. Chewing gum illegal SG. READ COMMENT think think you’re talking someone else. definitely children. never said did. Singapore though.   Seems fair article vaccination requirements. I’m enjoying haven’t issue, point. still don’t know happily ignore law bar. Ask Mother Theresa. must children concerned long covid children. extraordinary selfish put comfort ahead safety children. really want masking home. sure social distance. Also wash hands frequently. children. small sacrifice know do. expect impact new gerrymandering voter suppression laws far greater. Good that
U want stay home instead hospital u pay 
If u vaccinated u feel bad free cuz u least tried healthy eating major source infection? well that’s new &amp; work bar! 😂 Hope transmit anyone else... want shame anything, decision put people risk. Importantly, me, least wee bit think it. case.

That stereotype ""Singapore canes spitting gum kills drugs"".

Note support death sentence exists country aware case whatsoever. 5 Pfizer's phase 3 trial, several thousand throughout Israel. Outcomes better least 2-fold Israel cohort versus 2-dose vaccinated group. yet, think conservatives back power years that's 100% table. Maybe get legalized 2030. Got link could read this? real fucking battle trying convince mother get vaccinated, I'm really trying leave stone unturned... truly sorry comment came sounding negative way. meant cause grief question decision.

I similar boat you, looking perspective another parent make kind decision. people (especially internet critical anyone's preference topic), often use gotcha leading questions. comment must sounded similar, truly ernest. 

My kid turn 5 1.5 months, race lower age approval birthday something weights heavy me.

Again sorry words came across wrong way, last two years hard many, specially others seemed skipped pranced along without care world it. said even children? regardless, sounds ridiculous. worst part fake vaccine cards COPS making government equipment  realistically what's gonna change people see friends dying unvaccinated think ""huh, maybe Tucker Carlson right"" might right. Unfortunately, suspect even support affordable health care danger ethically incoherent angry others find hard believe going risk lives children without asking home. also hope eat separate rooms that's major source infection. time sensitive lot people tough covid fir weeks admitting real problem. got kids vax yesterday cvs. insurance wife point name, I'd, etc even come up.

So point pharmacist going ask. Squid Game option? seen requirements insurance engage extreme activities like climbing Mt. Everest? Possible likely not. Immunity vaccination driven antibodies, passive. infection ""took hold"" fought without symptoms would immune system generate response.  read part article all? think might possibly this? Please keep spot dumb parrots mile away.. Theoretically, people liable theory intentional and/or negligent misrepresentation, depending specific Facebook post. everyone would get 2 doses, people probably need booster year able make covid19 minor disease (ie: much less death flu). elderly, immunocompromised, similarly risked people would still need 3rd shots (probably 1-2 months 2nd shot) immunocompromised would need regular boosters. Unfortunately, seem like US going get anywhere near 90% vaccinated ever, everyone needs booster protect themselves...  cases, would beneficial kill USA avoid medical debt, going hospital though, kinda sudden illnesss.

Suppose 3 kids, house right.

You want kids get house, big cash savings go college.

Unfortunately cancer, another serious illness choice, kill 5 years less treatment, although could survive lucky enough.

However, recently laid uninsured, even new treatment could actually save life, version insurance covers certain death.


So, get treatments, die? Please keep mind, lose house college savings, also declare bankruptcy. job still might able cling onto house bankruptcy, there's way pay anything.

If die though, kids paid college house live in, certain they'll *way* better financially future die.

If take treatments, probably going die anyway.

There ways could set scenario make even screwed.

For example, might already elderly, desperate need full time care suddenly. unexpected, transferred assets name avoid lost, children pay massive medical bills care. cases might saved Medicare, hey might fall ill early 60s doomed vegetable years, that's got something like 25% chance happening personally.

Your care likely slurp away tens thousands dollars *at least* family, probably going suffering absolute shithole whole time. could stay family turn full time care givers.

Personally, I'd probably instead. CDC's list bullshit. Boosters open all. ...this Singapore. Yes see mean. However, believe majority redditors American, better worse really depends makes money. Premium increase probably. third Pfizer 4th November. Nothing lucky nothing second shot March well even first one barely anything. thank you:) people back issues sit behind pc day Fuckin liberals, man. Read comment again... get covid vaccination caught covid 3 months later... CAN'T take Tetanus, Pneumonia&lt;-- shots shared ingredient manufacture, 3 manufactured using egg yolks , people allergic things includes ingredients covid shots, people allergic sorts things, allergic reactions vary mild itching fatal. one infected bar all. maybe 2 2 years. there’s that. anyone who’s scared bar shouldn’t go. &amp; news im talking protests said don’t care those. vaccine passport BS wont last.. enjoy basically since reasons getting booster shot 100% psychological. filled form said around people time local vaccine givers happily gave shot. also happen US State really care NEED booster happy give one want one.

BTW, feel 10x better knowing booster shot really helped get house start re-interacting people again. Remindme! 75 days   literally those! vaccine available lung cancer, would agree unvaxxinated smokers pay medical bills.  wondering incident would positive effects antibody levels?

It's likely got little boost. I'm absolutely haunting person responsible. push false inaccurate information? What's motive?

One possibility: academia, prestige drives pretty much everything. get prestige work widely publicized, discover something society thinks important, lots scientists reference work later papers. Also, many people academic positions publish lot keep job (let alone get promotion), there's motivation ""publish perish"". lot people want publish study results basically ""meh, tell whether thing worked"".

Another possibility: people running crappy studies may true believers Ivermectin want believe new favorite drug actually work. Scientists doctors immune wishful thinking rest us.

Yet another possibility: sloppy lazy.

And could combination well.

For good writeup people thought drug might work first place, likely problems are, good bad earlier trials, check writeup CDC February. think #1 quote Ivermectin shown inhibit replication SARS-CoV-2 cell cultures.^13 However, pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic studies suggest achieving plasma concentrations necessary antiviral efficacy detected vitro would require administration doses 100-fold higher approved use humans. ask even read news? aren’t stories issue. want people get infected bar, that’s you. Indeed, paid holiday Oct 30 Nov 7, effect holiday lock seen 2 weeks so... Thanks everyone responses! appreciate it! eligible bc I'm teacher hoping husband could get booster holidays. Singapore made unvaccinated pay COVID related medical care unvaccinated would otherwise paid government.

So still get care. comes bill. 

Thoughts that? Sad say, go VT, parts anti-vax. guess true state rural areas. 

But, taking 300 daily cases 3 deaths day, yeah it’s smaller state smaller population, huge impact. people live it’s over.  Honestly think real question point people simply longer care. point rapidly approaching.  nope. bouncers. many bars not. do, typically late night hours only. Let ask this. assume children. mask home? socially distance home? realize covid spread occurs home? equally likely get covid me. infection could asymptomatic. even know it.We're vaccinated adults makes even likely we're asymptomatic. think likely child get covid chance meeting grocery store 15 seconds home hours end?

To reply issue long covid, vast majority resolve themselves. I'm well aware risk. extremely low. I'm willing take that. Please start masking home going expect everybody else mask. home biggest risk is. haven’t looked, would probably report it. sources friends go NYC &amp; bartender sure shit kicking income door am, (MN) adult brother got paid get his, it’s actually free.

I got mine early got nothing satisfaction. one bar bouncers? make part job

""you're list ID, vax cards? sorry brah, getting in"" point significant effect next election? Actually plan still going execution... mentally impaired thing BS made lawyers Op Ed: ""Opinions mixed"" together think get decent chunk population lot countries.

One deep wisdoms: **""the vaccine make sterile three generations""**. 🤦 callous, tribalistic. ""Unvaccinated choice"" also going pretty non-functional authoritarian rabbit hole go down.

This certainly perfect certainly solve underlying problems. Though, Singapore together enough probably cause much real harm either. wear mask? Works Japan (I live here). Terrible headline. Previously Brazil, China, Schengen Europe UK arbitrarily banned entry, rest world could come go pleased. countries deal restrictions, making US anything safer imported cases variants.  vaccinated care non vaccinated. vaccinated go hospital die getting Corona, matter people chose protect do?    state (Colorado) hard time virus right now? far know, Colorado high vaccination rate (62%) compared states, it’s still getting absolutely wrecked. 

Hospitalizations/ infections among fully vaccinated still significantly lower hospitalizations/infections among unvaccinated individuals, even though boosters slow roll out. Lots people getting infected, infections among vaccinated asymptomatic/mild, infections among unvaccinated pretty nasty. 

Is unvaccinated individuals spreading around, coupled low mask-wearing people getting back normal. vaccines’ effectiveness waning face new variants. above.  Today shit Sherlock. Weekend numbers. they've lot weekends since start pandemic, still pretty incredible.

Sao Paulo state bigger lot countries terrible situation earlier year. 14-day average deaths cases 90% since peak. What's different Wakefield never retracted idea continued push order sell test kits later books shit. misguided science, start outright malicious attempt make money people goes day.

This ivermectin shit least looks like politically guided bad science Lol I'm categories. suddenly developed immunocompromised condition couple months ago miraculously cured third shot. Nah, look figure 3, looks like people stopped getting virus day 9-12ish. That's quite right. stopped *testing positive* days. exposures led infections happened 4-14 days prior (it's quicker Delta prevalent, graph 2020). *might* even *some* protection *day one*. I'm going say sure, clearly kicks pretty quickly. 

For me, week two first dose would good enough, kids. even possible? Since testing covid costs 20 100 euros weeks already numbers significantly lower, much less people get tested regular basis. conspiracy theorists drop reported cases did‘nt happen. seems odd dispatcher callcenter staffs 100 people

I dispatch plumbers 

(The Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency U.S. Department Homeland Security, plumbers listed part America's essential critical infrastructure workforce.Apr 3, 2020)

My 6 months 10/30.

I able get (moderna booster) yes? consequences vaccinated, consequences getting sick. United States, prior vaccine mandates (e.g. Smallpox) came fine non-compliance. That's direct ethical denying medical care they've already gotten sick late get vaccinated. Afterlife real, they're still stupid. They're stupid somewhere else.  words, got lucky low exposure.

It's quantity issue. Look like silly exercises ask many kindergarteners could take fight.

A low level exposure range someone contagious minutes would like fighting 3-4 kids. Lays day so, overall pretty easy deal with.

A mid level exposure near someone contagious coughing wearing mask might sick week two comparable fighting 6-7 kids once. Annoying, get hurt little, still manageable.

A high exposure like someone infectious coughing directly face masks going facing 80-90 kids once. screwed.

The vaccine lets bring buddy fight. booster let bring second one. though, get bored standing around stop paying attention. booster adds another buddy fight try help wake first two.

In end though, get high enough load (face enough kids), still get pretty sick defenses overwhelmed natural immunity vaccine matter.  anyone find IHME model pretty much nonsense? seems like every month updated exact projection...100,000 lives saved universal masking (whatever actually means). Except end date always pushed back. October December March 2022. people think bother, realize yes still get covid, also reducing chances hospitalization 30 times. 
I uncle would rather go side effects instead bitches ""they"" going make get travel anywhere anything.... WELL GET FUCKING SHOT! edit: sorry I'm beyond people. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Not rubella, almost always mild children, often asymptomatic.

The big reason 50 states mandate rubella vaccine children protect pregnant women getting it, causes birth defects, miscarriage, dead newborns.

Why vaccinate pregnant women only? like vaccines, rubella disease 100% effective; letting disease circulate everyone else would continued horrible problems subset pregnant women, forever. Instead, widespread vaccination eventually slashed cases 10/year (American travelers countries, generally vaccine fails). compares \~12,500,000 cases year last pre-vaccine pandemic 1964-1965.

If argument ""we never mandated vaccinates kids protect others"", really true. consider rubella, America done universally long time.

If argument ""No COVID vaccination scheme prevent endemic COVID"", yes, may true, unfortunately. argument ""No COVID vaccination scheme greatly reduce spread protect others save many lives"", no, that's false. Personally follow makes perfect enemy good.

All said, I'm necessarily taking position needs age 5-11 COVID school mandates days EUA. crazy look data millions doses administered age group, first, making policy decisions based data much stronger possible trial.

(Though full disclosure, wife vaccinating 5 year old simply pediatrician advises direct benefit, etc. benefit society nice bonus, hypothetically negating change decision) Ivermectin ivermectin. issue formulation rather a) work COVID-19 human doses b) horse doses much bigger, hence taking dangerous.

The big spender tourists long trip plane pay test, cost big total travel cost, weekend travellers mostly, even less going Plattsburg shopping day. calculation US land travellers pay biggest spender touristic industry Canadian discouraged travel spend locally instead. Basically form protectionism. CVS. basically said ""check signify qualify"" ask follow-up questions.

I qualify, even probably would done anyway. like there's supply shortage. vaccines expensive. solution produce more, pick choose give to. Giving people boosters way excludes people getting first dose. Oh, ERs overrun ivermectin poisonings middle America summer good enough you? assuming vaccines approved use US approved worldwide? country version FDA. every country approved Pfizer and/or Moderna vaccine use country. Plus, US federal government buying donating doses around world. We've committed donating 1.1 billion doses end October, already donated 234 also assuming Pfizer Moderna running max capacity able keep demand. Given number people US flat refusing get vaccine, enough capacity.

They'd started giving *vaccines* people, surely? Never mind boosters. forgotten year? Well kinda logic went parliament building members like lambs slaughter.

Individuals talk healthcare provider personal risks.""

 
Having said that, travel different parts states job (especially low vax areas) feel like I'm pretty justified booster. people infected develop antibodies got vaccine. words, everyone gets infected actually makes antibodies, kids. Almost everyone gets vaccinated makes antibodies. Now, antibodies whole immunity, there's that, even so, antibodies highly predictive future protection.

See here: people vaccinated tons antibodies: immunity past infection *and* least one shot mRNA vaccine incredible immunity.  Germany mask mandate never dropped, you’re clearly talking ass Thanks! article Singapore Healthcare Singapore [] largely consists government-run publicly funded universal healthcare Yes mean welcome third world country passports. Going places require visa advance schedule appointment embassy give entire financial family history.

People western passports either get plane need go online electronic travel authorization may take hours. Maybe century.  vaccinated go hospital 

Covid vaccines cure car accidents; vaccinated people still need go hospital.  ""What ~~starving~~ unvaccinated people Africa?""

\-WHO, probably ... what

 ಠ_ಠ joke. Lol back card requirement silly. need /s  Vaccinations pain arse get places Australia. town, nearest centres hour half drive away, there's public transport, lot people low income. Even registration required internet access knowledge. library people coming asking librarian help - even email addresses (required registration). 

The government cocked roll out. people got ""over it"". Plus there's fear around vaccine people critical thinking skills determine what's real. incentive like vax lotto help overcome challenges, worth it.

I already vaxxed found comp, entered lottery yeah $1m would super helpful right now. Singapore west west west Texas I’d like see US Canada spaced 8-12 weeks apart order get 1st doses largest amount people. 10-week interval two AZ shots. Seems good decision long run. Pfizer booster next. dont see one person actually adhering it

People promised way feasible current vacciantion rates. Especially, lockdown significant restrictions people vaccine. would difficult make work even high vaccination rates, delta variant shifts R0 much larger numbers. current situation South South-Eastern Germany, already incidence numbers several thousand per 100,000 group unvaccinated people. well possible health system become severely overron within next two weeks. means late extra vaccinations prevent that. 

Models talk 50,000 200,000 additional deaths. scenarios, even best ones look pretty. Certainly rush vaccinations, fear many, late. universal policy  doubt know entire manufacture process every covid vaccine way knowing may compound may use used others.

The CDC website would information. magic process step vaccine creation hidden unknown outsiders. really transparent process.  new rules require foreign air travellers vaccinated get in. Rather random countries picked Trump Feb 2020. safer before, vulnerable. mention fellow countryfolk merrily flying back forth countries whole time. Uhm mean... die covid cant pay bills guess ?  get you‘re saying know show symptoms get tested without cost. weren‘t majority even noticable decrease reported infections least days happened long time ago ethnic quota nothing new still around.

The constant surveillance proposal sounds hokey me. don’t remember proposal can’t find references online. Pretty sure time distorted memory whatever mind.

Frankly, it’s pretty irresponsible throw without bringing receipts. purpose? want force people vaccinate, force vaccinate 

how bankrupting people solution anything?  wise man told me, sit every frying pan know what's taste steak. True words. Testing still covered insurance symptoms doctor recommends test. infections identified people exhibit symptoms. Removing free tests probably led decrease identification asymptomatic presymptomatic cases asymptomatic cases majority anyway.  That’s good, hope goes time. It’s way confusing isn’t eligible boosters right it’s resulting lot people getting boosters really be. know mean end ... disease before, need adjust. 

OTOH, vaccinated (and boosted appropriate), there's much changing. There's extra reason sad, go whatever makes happy. Life still good, go live.

And wear mask, meet outside? may able control environment, still control react it. stop NY government office worker taking money provide proof covid vaccination?

 mandate federal government proof vaccination still issue crooked government employee take money falsify proof vaccination hell even doctors taken money fake information, drug tests prime example easily fake got shot charge people vaccinated.

Yes charge unvaccinated ones. anyone link vaccine numbers 5-11 year-olds US? State state? think people wear masks forever? That’s living.

Some people get dealt shitty hands health sucks. always happened fucking life. 

People vulnerable wear N95s make best choices terms socialization. I

’ve 3 covid shots, I’m done. Must people original vaccine trials (that started autumn 2020) got boosters study. millions unvaccinated Ontario. case rates rise enough ICU capacity absolutely risk. honestly don’t know. I’m assuming it’ll separate thing preexisting conditions. say!  someone decided debate wearing masks store wanted speak manager.

First thing throw tantrum masks told “ don’t remember mask mandate effect pull government official website says state mask mandate? cant dont need wear mask “

“ need wear mask store “

“ say government website need “

“ doesn’t matter need wear mask store decide shop denied service escorted security “

“ prove store needs mask mandate still didnt tell government website says that”

“ dont need to”

“ yes do”

“ private company?”

“ what? dont get it. aint private company. guys big many locations”

“if dont know look find rights too” essentially is, it’s called “not smoking”. lynchpin Ivermectin research base suspect studies? answer question. end pandemic. ever take PCR test. It’s likely viral load less able detected rapid test. PCR sensitive test. think used good life :) Looking (it's nov8, regardless URL :), VT middle-of-the pack USA, bad states 150-200 per 100K. 

Most states areas low vaccination, surrounded states may different rates, ... first thought thank god don’t anytime soon honest Shame away! tell you’re malicious. end day ppl say whatever want internet, doesn’t affect thinking life whether financially responsible consequence? Haha, well certainly disagree, I'm going philosophy science specifically science writer/educator! Perspective insight 100% equally important access information itself. problem pointing that, monetary means go university subject (or one similar), I'd essentially screwed trying learn ideas—and extension, convey them—myself. considering many parts world people *far* worse am, blame understanding many concepts considering complex modern science become.

If made progress front increasing access information, believe would individuals would interested taking mantle trying educate community, even outside established institutions (for example, despite bad variety ways, YouTube still hosts great wealth educational videos would hope continues expand). seems general lack transparency regards scientific information probably gives net worse effects positives, worry continue snowball left unchecked. That's perspective, though. Could be, would probably also especially red areas likely impacted. winter! cold, people indoors lot more. Spain &amp; Portugal better climate many countries unclear vaccination alone enough keep virus away. also previous infections Germany instance.  Time tell keep low case numbers we’re talking paying friends family’s healthcare gave Covid. failure prevent yourself, financially hook it. examples engaging risky health behavior, there’s question healthcare covered. Someone mentioned HIV- don’t tell people unprotected sex risky behavior means need pay resulting healthcare. fair, represents 100% increase number annual shots get.  I'd also assume European countries quite comprehensive (and honest) numbers.

Numbers might make look like ""epicenter"", reality may different.

For example, ground Africa covid mumbers really bad, that's largely countries really afford lock extended periods time. Despite official numbers really reflect this. People test, buy fake negative covid certificates, fake vaccination passports etc little money, etc.

I also friends living China, say _really_ bad there, numbers declared probably really understated.   Gottlieb thoughts:

""I think reason people get together person Thanksgiving year. Unlike last year, actually tools available protect families environment. Many kids partially vaccinated then, getting together dinner fine.""

""I would wait another month two lift regulations precautions schools. next days Thanksgiving beginning back end wave, month December month decline, January, prevalence cases low.""

""As get back normal, pre pandemic, 2019 life, want caution anybody gets worried cases pick happens. occur UK, longer term, cases decline even full capacity restrictions. end pandemic phase virus never closer.""

""To me, initial rollout 5-11 vaccines outstanding."" don’t think it’s realistic expect everyone get annual booster. Flu % participation pretty low. thought Canada still restrictions nasty southerns. I'm sorry think things actually happened people America real? I’m icu nurse disagree obesity isn’t huge problem eventually cause collapse system.
