Something manage far responsibly America. y'know, always sitting highest standard living charts every metric imaginable sinking steadily towards 40's.

I'm ""ready"" 200k dead end July.. surprise, continue get angrier day fellow Americans take seriously.. magic number? kids still suck critical care resources beds, forcing us straight even admit people might truly need vent. 

Those kids still walking away significant ARDS induced lung damage, clotting requiring least 30 days post discharge anticoagulants god knows else come due virus.

I'm Canada folks city put together facebook group support local restaurants takeout curb side pick (they even changed regulations could deliver alcohol). Even here, soon allowed open patios posts patios. I've seen driving looks like staff masked customers (would make hard eat/drink) although tables farther apart previous years far enough apart social distancing line ups clumps people. I'm worried start spreading again. Well, large portion population make virus, carbon output reduced. Hello, common sense.Not wearing one stigma. Ironically, perhaps floyd never would died states still lockdown. Larry Kudlow character Wall Street Mad Men, would appear touch.

Amazing pay trillions dollars taxes trolling, lies, bad sales pitches blame. effective June 25. Right. lip service voters media. way comes time vote, say 'I told people right thing save everyone.'

Wow, score card colors ""reversed"" I'm used seeing.

But even so, right, really hard tasked making potential life death decisions.

I took quick look main plan COVID-10 addemium, looks like earlier come system better chance end ""low"" score, thus able potentially better/advanced care. 

Of course Triage case unlike ""injury"" based ""one time"" Triage scenarios, likely end ongoing thing put even heavier burden healthcare workers tasked make decisions, could mean taking away treatment folks, instead deciding front get's treated first. mentally would someone actually became patient who's care.

The thing makes sad really looks like reason something looks activated/used first place.

But instead looks something healthcare workers going subjected to, due poor leadership national state leadership.

Sigh... bit fuck 24 days cases 20+ cases quarantine border. community spread couple months OK letting foreigners long need. produce enough energy, food goods fine plus get enjoy countries regions without tourists fantastic.

One bar 85 cases covid East Lansing. I'm Bay Area. county (San Mateo) tried think efforts look like futile resistance soon. get from? I'm Chile shit bad, soon run ICU beds we're 4k daily cases (a lot considering 19 million population). South America screwed without vaccine. American culture doesn’t really allow long term concerted effort combat virus responsibly. People poor little access cash flow negligible savings, work. Also sense entitlement boomer-era coddling made Americans selfish egocentric. Red imbeciles emboldened orange ape look everyone else iron sights react poor trigger discipline.

It’s shameful state affairs, humbling too. Frowned upon, probably. Illegal, maybe.

#Translation: 
Financially, little doubt Denmark's corona strategy works better Swedish

During corona crisis become inevitable compare Denmark Sweden. status Danish economy better Swedish one.

Economically, Denmark stands clear winner Sweden pandemic. Danish corona strategy far worked better - primarily measured terms number sick dead - also measured development economic parameters consumer confidence, unemployment growth - rather - gross domestic product.

“Denmark entered pandemic lower unemployment rate Sweden, measured critical economic parameter, Denmark maintained lead. Sweden's unemployment rate risen much, country failed gain significant benefits decision shut down, ""writes John Authers, commentator Bloomberg.

Jan Størup Nielsen, chief analyst Nordea, agrees: “Measured financial indicators follow, unemployment GDP, conclusion reasonably clear. going better Denmark Sweden. ”

But also emphasizes precise separate ""the handling corona effect export composition two countries.""

Sweden's export composition large industrial production, machinery trucks cyclically sensitive Danish one pharmaceutical products, food wind turbines climate exports, says Størup Nielsen. ""What what's rain piece, hard calculate, math can't make. know Denmark among countries performed absolutely best world. also got crisis, largely without imbalances. Sweden, things different housing market vulnerable somewhat away balance point, ”says Størup Nielsen.

#Major blows Sweden

In comment, John Authers refers new analysis Dhaval Joshi, Chief Strategist Europe, BCA Research, London, concludes “the Swedish approach working. Looking figures consumer confidence, Sweden bigger blow Denmark. ”

The low consumer confidence Sweden, according John Authers analysis BCA Research, hinges fact number corona infetions number deaths corona significantly higher Sweden Denmark. Friday, Johns Hopkins Institute calculated number deaths Sweden 5230 603 Denmark, population almost twice large.

“Viruses naturally lethal effect economic activities, demonstrated Sweden. shutdown advantage eliminating behavior ""freeriders"" ""super spreaders"". Notwithstanding fact hit issues individual freedoms disturbing issues intrusion demonstration authority, ”emphasizes John Authers.

#Inevitable pain

He emphasizes, also citing examples various practices US states, ""pain inevitable. direct approach tackling challenge choosing shutdown meant significantly less financial damage. least Scandinavian context, ""there are, Auther's description,"" two beautiful, liberal similar Nordic countries. ""

In combination Sweden's refusal completely shut economy - attracted glimpse world - Swedish government spent large sums support, among things. business. Aid packages made 270 billion. sv. also guarantee schemes state also impose. total amount 835 billion. sv., kr, corresponding approx. 16 per cent. GDP.

In Denmark, total aid established approx. 400 billion funding easier Danish government Swedish government.

“The 10-year Swedish interest rate approx. 0, Denmark 0.40 per cent, Danish government earns borrowing,” points Jan Størup Nielsen.

Very interesting Danes actually spent less support packages Swedes did. didn’t know tidbit article. rest unsurprising: it’s clear it’s VIRUS causing economic problems, lockdowns per se. let virus continue run populace rather suppress keep suppressed seems quite obvious worse outcomes health safety also economically. Okay that's thing causing spread. Oh bars, yeah people work there. government says ""over dead bodies"" extending unemployment, need realize means putting people back risk spreading it. Hey Federal Officials? Talk state leaders try coordinate better. People can't go places much actually mandate things health threats 

Otherwise, bunch people seem care. 

That's lesson what's happening now. several police departments Washington come statements essentially stating can, likely enforce penalties come wearing masks necessary situations. Big yikes here. hate flu argument. flu still kills people, imagine people wore mask flu, flu like symptoms. read article you? bad idea like reopen state guise “economy” rich get back making money try people getting infected can’t make political calculations. Well, would wouldn’t he? wants throw 5G towers force vaccine. /s Title little bit misleading. Germany socialised healthcare, never pay tests met certain criteria varying state state like:

* contact Covid positive people (contact tracers notification contact tracing app) 
* visit doctor ""prescribes"" testing thinks show typical symptoms
* city/district 50 infected per 100,000 get free tests want travel parts Germany demand negative Covid tests
* health care / nursing home worker

That problem with. Based count one journalist going specifically tourist sites. lack scientific rigor appalling. Specially there's literally statistical support idea there's flare-up going ^^^^^^eeeeeeee healthy immune system fight fucker chance activate?  

No, immune system never seen ""fucker"" mount attack virus virus established foothold lungs. immune system response cause lungs partially filled fluid. Inflammation lung tissue make harder lungs oxygenated blood remove carbon dioxide. Backwards mentality culture hidden behind religion issue. America claim Christian whilst also white supremacists understand Messiah Arab. Incorrect anyone really believe real option put life hold way least summer 2021? what, still effective vaccine?

""Then point original lockdown?"" going become real question.

Supposedly allow healthcare system prepare, have, California amassed stockpile medical n95 masks. Ventilator capacity never elastic people imagined, limited number doctors equipment. treatment improves cost extent? improvement treatment worth amount time spent lockdown? 

Imagine billions dollars lost places early lockdowns like California spent finding new treatments Covid. spent saving lives countless areas healthcare improving education etc. etc. 

It’s simple question. Good idea, hopefully entertainment industries take note NYC follow (sports, movie theaters, etc) I'm gonna try comment anology show stupid love it. gotta end fashimism bigotry news class warfare!! also fuck nazis different view me!!!

Do see retarded sounds? that's point made. True. everyone know symptoms all.

My grandmother death bed last year. soon dies 94 doctors say coronavirus.

So yea hear look funny seriously doubt died also zero problems sacrificing staff. heard message was: Masks effective thus create competing demand healthcare system. real power speaks... Yes, expect test positivity rates go crazy amounts too. testing station testing max capacity graph spike down. US cases graph ever increasing line, still first wave. need help either (whose exposure know) stranger caregiver (who idea person work).

But referring fact age range still family high risk groups friends, statistically 1 5 kids 18 24 still live parents even don't, point understanding collective responsibility protect vulnerable, can't entirely withdraw society work, shopping, go doctor, etc. Thank voice reason. solution except learning live virus. looks like degree herd immunity kicking in, hope virus weaken become another coronavirus among many. Well that's distasteful. makes sense economically also makes wonder ancestors left trees. saw something vr fireworks thing planned days back. I'll try find link get home work like. deep collective empathy one another need here. ""Love thy neighbor"" preached rarely practiced. middle lower class. Yes right I'm sure going go fine public fights shop owners anything /s That’s don’t consider people also interact general public. Everyone needs food supplies. take virus hit local grocery store exposing front line workers, families, anyone else stop get loaf bread. past months, least dozen stories latino population quarantining restricting movements, mostly economic reasons.

This higher prevalence comes unsurprisingly light that, though hesitate call reason. Differences ace2 receptors ethnic groups also large factor. Yes are, reality testing way more, counting antibody positives total cases. people currently counted ""case"" numbers beyond wack. need reporting # hospitalized patients given day, phony # increases decreases depending amount testing taking place. county doesn’t even icu hospital massive tourist destination wine country California mean 600 test day... goes quick. Presidential logic: stop reporting hurricanes really happen! Mitch lives on! Where's doubting that? Statements form ""If P, Q"" imply ""not P"" logic. even stigma PRAYING air holes, fucking evil skeksi. go weeks sure, need expand testing get clearer view scale outbreak Florida... telling America permanently fucked huh?  actually also you. perfect protection provide protection. Honestly, even think that! don’t think current ego/psychological/technological need society asking people pause 3-6 months move forward much anxiety filled panic driven minds. least states consistent. /s I'm northern California, let tell you, anti mask people outspoken. boss, upper management anti mask. Two coworkers came back crowded functions, I'm getting harassed work wearing mask. great* grew HIV/AIDS crisis, heavily educated school difference HIV (the virus), AIDS (the disorder).

Now we're midst another viral-caused disease, drives wall reporters journalists seem make distinction. 

How much slack members public grant journalists differentiate COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2, use name disease they're clearly referring virus? 

Some even seem realize there's difference. California that. 

my gradmother hospital urinary tract infection weeks ago (Bay Area), got tested COVID. negative, positive, still would sent back assisted living facility. would quarantined room certain hall somewhat closed off. Thank you, definitely need something change here, awful. I'm sorry everything through, watched happened NY horror. think seeing that, people states would get shit together reason opposite here. obvious anyone paying attention everything opened way soon, people acted though virus gone. AZ example deal this. Months prepare still I'm seeing healthcare workers low PPE. terrible. surprise one. People need stop making argument not. authoritarian regimes outbreaks control. Many democratic nations outbreaks largely suppressed too. Masks authoritarian flex, come virus control, like several parts China. anything, Chinese government prefer masks come asap messes facial recognition social credit system.

&amp;#x200B;

Russia, Iran, China relatively authoritarian regimes:

\- Russia first wave outbreak control.

\- Iran second wave outbreak control.

\- China outbreak control. Several cities provinces reported cases longer require masks public spaces.

&amp;#x200B;

South Korea, New Zealand, Taiwan, Japan, United States relatively democratic societies:

\- South Korea contained outbreaks intense contact tracing mask wearing.

\- New Zealand largely contained outbreak hard lockdown.

\- Japan culturally able avoid massive outbreak due prevalent use masks, even non-pandemic situations.

\- Taiwan contained outbreak heavily screening flights manufacturing masks en mass.

\- United States outbreak control excuses. Fining people companies without masks violating social distancing protocols redirecting money testing hospital care authoritarian parking speeding tickets. country go without fight. Also note 1918 Spanish Flu, US plunge authoritarianism several cities mandating masks, lockdowns, social distancing regulations pandemic. Buckle in; however, we're every bit dumb back then. Expect 1.5-2 year slog get this. place world screwed NYC, beyond predictions hypothesis. cant even serve example scale, total outlier deserve case study Yea aren’t showing people filled hospital? girlfriend works hospital area highest Covid increase country said hospital WAY fewer people original outbreak.  Wow. Can't believe grown adults acting much immaturity. I'm upset allowed society devolve much. can. comes money. hospital administrators LOVE money. guy sneezed camera!! need scream echo chamber vent frustration. Thx.

No one taking seriously anymore. Slowly, slowly. partner essential worker one wears mask work, keep ourselves. locked 100 days mental health suffered immensely. He's getting back one hobbies out-door sport. people camping eating together wearing masks either.

This brings in-laws. work private practice healthcare, think totally safe since ""isolate"" wear N95 masks. Since this, feel like total freedom movement. Several taken individual road trips visit newborn baby. One road-tripping plans see dozen people. partner joining also stay elderly family. gives fuck anymore!

\*screech\* Interesting point. think $200, even $100 much first offense. People losing jobs left right hours cut...for millions people US amount money simply unaffordable time. think deterrence done lower fine first offense. police supposed protect citizens uphold laws county/state. pandemic literal epitome need police (to stop people endangering health/lives others.

As per penalties, think initially, $250 fine announced beforehand inform public normal disclosure (television press conference, internet, radio). 

After period time (several weeks) fine increase $1000 more. Keep mind fines illegaly dumping garbage this, states. 

Exposing people potential sickness even death certainly warrant expensive fine illegal dumping right?

Obviously police can't cover every single business area, long officer near largest, precedent set. example, officer outside Walmart, Costco, Target, large beaches etc. show average citizen issue important take seriously.

The argument expensive police utilized this. argue cities use traffic officers, deputize citizens (will certainly help work) exclusively deal masking violations police force spread thinly. revenue fines would also help alleviate cities' deficits. United States ain't united anymore. CDC says may able contain virus prepared worst case scenario, interpret mean ""only Arizona"" ""only South."" interpret mean US, whole, serious trouble. 

And states waiting things get worse shutting shutting late there's latency period infections infections get confirmed.

Confirming infections like archeology. looking history. looking present. believe wear mask possibility might accidentally snag ridiculous comb hair expose huge bald spot back disgusting fucking head.

I highly recommend take deeper dive investigating topic discourse surrounding Swedish strategy think would right alley. FWIW academic deleted social media Cecilia Söderberg Naucler, prominent scientist critical Swedish strategy. one ""22 researchers"" first prominently criticized articles DN, SVD, etc. case particular abuse *very* gendered. Aside her, heard seen others also suffer women, people color, especially foreigners. example foreigners getting worse abuse many Swedish people attended [weekly protests strategy spit otherwise abused tend foreign-born Swedish-born point. Spitting someone pandemic could really considered bio terrorism all. serious case. 

The widespread aggressive abuse supporters towards critics Swedish strategy tbh one things fascinates topic: background climate science environmentalism I've *never* seen abuse denialism fever pitch outside sphere except Swedish coronadebatt arena. really fascinating it'd great someone would bonafide research phenomenon. 

But thank answer great day! know everyone going ""How possible open schools!?"" 

But [American Association say critical addressing racial social inequity. School closure virtual educational modalities differential impact individual population level diverse racial, ethnic, vulnerable groups, according guidance.

This recommendation seats bus riders cohort, use face coverings distancing possible, minimize number riders within reason. Encourage students options use alternative transportation.

For anyone know this, American yellow school buses location based. would something like Bus 1 stops every five blocks Maple Street Division Avenue Locust Lane, Bus 2 stops... Buses broken school, usually something like grades K-5 (ages 5-10), grades 6-8 (ages 11-13), grades 9-12 (ages 14-17).

What suggesting rather Maple Street bus Mrs. Johnson's class bus, maybe pairing classes. Families tend one child, spacing often 2-3 years perhaps multi-grade cohorts possible.

One dropped trial unrelated vaccine. far, COVID approximately 10 million cases. pales comparison Spanish Flu, ~500 million cases. Even better compare percentage population infected. Roughly 1/3rd world population infected Flu. COVID reach heights, would need 2.5 BILLION cases, roughly 250 times current amount cases. 

Comparing deaths, difference still big. Death estimates Spanish flu vary wildly (Wikipedia says 17 million 50 million, possibly 100 million, example). Let's say 35 million. roughly 7% people infected died. Right now, COVID 5% people infected die disease. I'm virologist speak whether one virus intrinsically deadly other, say overall, notorious increase survivability. Notice even prepared countries death reates 2-5% anyways. implies certain percentage people would died even best possible technology intervention available now.

Please consider this: **I AMERICAN TALKING US**. I'm talking globally. say world, whole, dropped ball pretty reductionist efforts medical community done. Brazil, Russia, US, UK outliers here. rest world done kinda bad worst, pretty good best, **particularly** Italy's suffering brought pandemic worldwide spotlight. I'm going talk efforts dozens countries US fucked response. 

Let's say COVID ends infecting 100 million people, 10 times current count (which might bit high, considering lot countries currently falling curve). **That still 25x fewer cases adjusted-for-population amount cases Spanish Flu had.** think nothing? talk kind success privileged position living modern society barely ever face actual tragedy.

Edit: Also, remember said OK, great perfect. Would bet life savings ""OK"" investment? No. strictly BAD. actually used ""look, gonna understand things take little longer global pandemic"" line special circumstances. Finally number actually looks like it'll accurate. live (a small town AZ), anti-maskers extremely aggressive refusing mask up, they've started openly confronting people wearing masks. feel extremely uncomfortable going shopping I've couple bad encounters now. multiple underlying health conditions really, really, catch disease, going without mask option me. 

We also neighbor treated badly employee business specifically dared wear mask. Long term morbidity would interesting know. risk death high, long term lung injury? kind data available years though.

I would like point long term/chronic case wide statement. time don’t know long symptoms/illness stays. Things like Kawasaki’s near lifelong, ectasia/aneurysm remaining well 20s 30. Things like increase mortality risk fall term morbidity. 

Morbidity something poorly understood categorized Corona right now. We’ve focused mortality part, morbidity deserves near equal focus. Someone dies 6 years later COVID induced cardiovascular disease, essentially COVID death. thought process contracted disease would never died timeline.

This paper points finger concerning issue COVID, children may susceptible mortality COVID, considerable morbidity might associated. incentive life punitive pressure terrible sickness death. respond those, would respond others? they're vocal. show large numbers municipal meetings, care crowd, municipal government meets, get 25 citizens bitching masks... easy assume must represent people, opposing viewpoint showed meeting...

The government never allowed order people around like that, free people decide bodies. talking about? Coronavirus reddit hate reddit?

Yea ok you’re obviously try get reaction me, I’m done child. That's trails first Yeah, they've got people convinced better ask go back work. Challenge trials unnecessary unethical level virus spread remains high. Yes one first lock down, point is, even though US didn’t lock soon actually got case numbers go faster held deaths per capita lower beginning Denmark.

Contact tracing probably way go. know US too, least state, results pretty great. Lockdowns, absolutely not, unless last resort like New York City. People comply personal risk high. Masks aren’t really big deal wear like shutdowns studies effectiveness either extremely limited scope controlling confounding factors. Experts don’t agree work real world practiced. UK’s leading health professional not, neither Denmark’s, sure? Even Fauci wasn’t sure settled answer finally. 

Everyone acts like murdering grandmothers don’t wear one. quite far-fetched.

Also Denmark’s shutdown lot easier comply short. life actually returned normal done. Here, lingered forever, naturally people get fed up, eventually things. sold us 15 days slow spread” told us 15 days shutdown would flatten curve lower eventual peak would come. told us opening would like starting cases new information... course people going comply. million risks lifespan need accept actually live lives actually left, one them, probably even largest one.

Wonder reason perhaps protests spreading due factors like indoor gatherings? see point. Medical professionals wearing climate controlled environment completely different wearing 90 degree oven Automotive shop environment. There’s thing called “willful ignorance”

Which suppose comes arrogance. full circle here. troll. way someone crazy. faking get viral social media. always wondered seemingly competent societies like Rome fell apart. see happens progressively. People get comfortable long start seeing separates them. infighting begins, social cohesion disappears. Every country reached peak inexorably falls pattern. lots money, hubris follows closely behind. poor people don’t time overtly proud individualistic. Remember happened toilet paper? think we’d behave rationally given information? think right thing information had. wore scarves instead. person's vote counts yours. market outdoor superspreading event I’m aware of, back December air cooler could easily allow respiratory transmission.

Also would lot touching things. won’t make people better. rona someone love dies won’t take precautions. I’m speaking frustration town NC wife people wear masks. local Facebook it’s nothing arguing rights politics comes masks several businesses “taking stand” telling town government requiring masks take fines. sheriffs office dosent care one else does, leaders boat them.

We selfish country. much virus. dangerous. live US, good here. US apparently ramping worst part peak, 3 months in, peak everyone else already came from. shockingly anomalous amongst comparisons.

I want read wrote again, look chart daily Covid ramping worst part peak""?

The daily deaths falling since everything started opening protests. continue downward trend.

Today/yesterday lowest number deaths since thing began back March.

You compare ""coming peak"" situation shots 10 days old, see Covid behaves pretty similarly everywhere. kind ""bloom"" lasts one month, things start fading out.  agree, can't go far things. said that, think deny ever lock again, perhaps local lockdowns. Like example, city near ICU capacity limits, lockdown, perhaps 2 - 3 weeks start seeing daily cases start fall off, slowly surely open within following 2 - 3 weeks. much smaller (in terms population) much shorter lengths time, still open maybe needing lockdowns.

But need see round goes. Maybe virus tire soon spiking states. real test here, playing peoples' lives, hey, we're far test, may well see happens allow educate us inform next wave / spike. Like Houston becomes dystopian hellscape next month two... yeah, probablyyyy short term localized lockdowns point time next time around. see cases naturally start trend 2 - 3 weeks something? Alright cool, ideal, especially deaths start really tick soon, anticipate, made perhaps pros outweighed cons. completely broken economy decade could worse virus, need balancing act here. virus may also teach us soon left unmitigated becomes dystopian hellscape, soo... yeah. decreasing ny vulnerable already dead According [MIT's page diagnostic test generally specific - meaning rarely gives false positives. said, 'very rarely' number, compare false negatives, MIT's page suggests much common false positives.

Basically, general idea 100 people test positive 100 people test negative, reality might 5 positives wrong, 10 negatives wrong. reality, 105 positive, 95 negative. I've seen false negative rates 30% thrown around articles discussions, disparity might even higher. humans get point say “fuck it”, accept risk is.

A lot people Tell almost everyone covid ICU 65 extremely overweight. lethal virus less ability spread anyways misread ""electric Trump"" found funny. Eh, bullshit. things take years.

Also you’re going need everybody take vaccine. Shouldn’t Problem considering willing people take vaccines pre COVID? ""Bar Lives Matter"" sign consecrated along famous ""Get Brain Morans"" sign. That's whole new level stupidity.  Double amount beds pretty much means half quality care. Exhausted inexperienced ICU staff spread thin reassuring there’s “bed available.” Administration glaze fact course. heart goes doctors nurses respiratory therapists trying juggle 25 balls CEOs talk beds. wore mask. sure assumed wasn’t. Remember reduce, prevent transmission. also it’s downtown La pass people without masks time. look 7 day average deaths actually plateauing slightly compared going down. Positive tests similar plateau 2-3 weeks ago interesting se happens next days. Remember stealing freedom making us wear helmets? wearing mask outdoors probably didn’t infect anybody. know, ""bankster"" word rather substantial anti-semitic history and, disagree larger point, time rising violence ethnic minorities, I'd encourage use language makes anti-semites think one them. 

Or makes Jews sub feel unwelcome. We're together. *This.* two students, one classmate known COVID-19 patient believed become infected school, grade believed contacted private academy.

I'm you, NY NJ locked along Rhode Island, Connecticut, DC Oh? Isn’t believe? stay home. sure “shot” was? didn’t insult you, think whatever makes happy. That’s choice won’t call names it. We're saved! Huzzah! Better something, nothing. again, reducing risk equal eliminating risk. get that. I’m going take N95 mask hands someone needs it, like son working MICU. That’s selfish. Somehow, folks believe statement somehow degrading people protesting - isn't.

Because bad actors Internet exactly that, gets real old fast. 

I think everyone intelligent well-intentioned largely agrees - seems large contingent people co-opting protests whataboutism largely bad faith. certainly true local subreddit; folks moved right ""more cases = tests"" ""bUt PrOtEsTs"" alarming ease.

It's unfortunately hard discuss issue without people preemptively putting defenses other. Yes, threads definitely changed way give bad connotation... bars restaurants live margins. 50% less patrons likely sustainable them. feel like guys think places raking millions year going home mansion. Heck, many probably even getting unemployment feed kids difficulties business owners get it. total cases (and deaths) continue decrease NY cases radically ***increasing*** TX.

I’m willing bet number asymptomatic high one. really love spelled exactly sounds It’s joke ffs mean mentioned hospitals empty Northern California ever coronavirus hot zone anyway? got shut prevent spread clear roads shuttle sick dying hospital. pulse whole coronavirus situation busy hospital std check NorCal, mean.... that’s using bad data make decision. can’t teach critically reason thoughts. It’s like trying explain someone drive hasn’t figured working legs yet. forget internal UV light too. point that, Reddit, user without verified qualifications inherent credibility. don’t recognize username, haven’t earned credibility consistent participation subreddit either.

So stand point- opinion holds weight American’s opinion subject. Highly regarded experts developing Oxford vaccine much higher level credibility average American whether vaccine safe. actually pretty good bit, gave soon. need decent lockdown commit to, clear goals surpass reopen anything. need mask wearing inside mandatory everywhere. need financial support everyone affected lockdown. need clear leadership federal level.

America capable this, except last thing, unfortunately makes hard anything else. Yup, American propaganda machine really blame. think selfish ""American Dream"" get house looks nice traditional family his/her cars driveway. ""me, me, me"" ""f- get money"" ""you could rich that"" mentalities. called ""land free"" ""today you, tommorow me"" ""respect neighbors"" always looking ways help vulnerable less fortunate groups society. whole become well adjusted injustice. I'm well aware population density point Texas NY deaths right media pretending like NY Texas fucked.

You keep pushing narrative Imagine much would saved us enacted February?  Something drinking bleach swilling around lungs....

And President sets shit example refusing wear mask. Vietnam hardly little though. Huge population, lots links hard hit countries Hope you’re right. Taiwan excluded, China included 🤔

Edit: infer lot lifestyle comments. seem like new age “muh freedoms” type.

And would extremely, extremely wrong.

So would like share class learned making assumptions? real begin with. vast majority U30s loot stores. minority bad actors things like seem like would much less trusting authority, less conscious others' well-being therefore less likely seek tests. Yeah wondered myself. people lucky enough get unemployment people may qualify. Also eventually extra added unemployment run What's career? I'm guessing one wont lose forever. will. I've never seen place cares less people reddit. Applebees corporate restaurants survive. Small restaurants bars wont. I'm saying allowed open getting mad people upset theyve lost everything bad look. bars likely opened money savings. recovery losses No. Thanks. That's fine. guys keep them. 

You hear? believe virus can't get anyone sick. Texas safe, plot dems I'll get vaccine president, advisors, congress line take live TV. People think innoculatory dose may determine disease severity, study disprove theory. study says *amount virus shed* asymptomatic symptomatic people same. makes mention innoculatory dose. yes good shape gunna help. virus doesn’t discriminate healthy people get sick virus too.  Mate, we’ll call whatever like ;-). I’m passing usage occurs NZ indicated Wikipedia link, it’s me. Isn’t language wonderful thing, ever evolving! one eat mask on? Yea. Meanwhile Leavenworth, WA, behest owner, staff members Cold Stone Creamery asking people without masks leave. hardcore Karen gets butthurt daughter asked leave, returns records bitching staff uploads Facebook, prompting y'allqaeda make threats one kicked daughter phone person.
So owner fired employee gave Karen coupon. no, probably going last time. got laid collected unemployment. Money is. Airlines get faa mandates social distancing requirements ""you must operate"". restaurants stores do. Airlines shouldnt allowed ""business usual"" knowing people take masks even short periods severely confined space recirculated air. Lets face it, change top American public pretty much fighting virus.
You believe someone badly fucked response pandemic desperately seeking reelection scientists medical people. Also knowledge countries dealt successfully virus well. Lol seriousness, yeah always outliers. vast majority people complications obese preexisting conditions way figure though? people developing specialized cells? Sure thing, bud. [Here lose immunity less 3 months guess, would vaccinate entire population within 3months get rid something. Dude put going grocery store last peas ...which exactly need close them. People responsible. So, yes, blame people still need closed. Bars higher risk indoor places drunk people EXTRA stupid irresponsible. travel nurse contracted Riverside Community. cancelled travel nurse contracts 3 weeks surge didn’t come time March/April. glad cancelled 3 weeks sucked;and hospital sucks, lol.

They HCA profit. corporation terrible. It’s also lot easier fuck testing protocols/procedures, CDC managed that. totally unprepared, every way possible. incorrect. Per Phase III, vaccine given thousands people tested efficacy safety.  protests spark spread, that's great. also means gather mass crowds ignore social distance worry spread. countries individual corona subs. could create multireddit subs world feed US news. outrage months overdue. American flying full flights peak lockdown. never promised sell flights capacity. said would block middle seats *could*, meaning able find someone sell to.

Now AA abandoned charade go back cramming basic economy passengers middle seats last three rows unless pay up. They're bad PR running airline people want fly on. capacity projected full within next 2 weeks. prediction disappeared TMC website.

They stopped updating data. shady all. Nope, nothing see here, please move beaches closing again? I'm Ohio also. still take non peak times I'll damned go sit outside trust servers clean table even. brother telling restaurants wearing mask where's live. Apparently think fake local health department anything. Thank do. know comment meant convey joke, thanks sticking us.  Maybe you’re asshole. able pay know Birmingham UK, right?

Because protesters pepper sprayed, bars open weekend. Sounds like Fauci given hope Americans acting reason logic. guess everything’s bigger Texas.☹️ USA’s citizens lower IQ Italy’s citizens. didn't. Cases continued trend downwards UK. gamble there’s “Virus run it’s course” option. 

If, many studies shown, there’s temporary immunity people get infected lingering respiratory effects, “through it”. It’s speeding us towards current average 5% death rate infected population, everyone, first round hoping come winter everyone’s immunity gone we’re passing around again, it’ll lower. testing take least one year depending many years spent Phase 2.

Its number time. need large enough n statistically valid. Normally takes long time, purely function money. Phase 3 safety, efficacy. errors, post correct :) Maybe consistent messaging, mass confusion, suspicion towards officials, uncertainty towards credibility messages given.

Remember things said government officials:

**""Seriously people - STOP BUYING MASKS!""**

\-US Surgeon General, February 2020

**""There reason anyone walking around mask on""**

\-Anthony Fauci, March 2020

Asian governments Taiwan Korea lie people effectiveness public mask wearing. such, close 100% compliance managed contain outbreak.

In contrast, now, result muddied response muddied communication, hands shitshow epic proportions. Arizona Thrift Shop got blocked again. 

I believe specific mod trying censor data protests correlated COVID outbreaks. Damn That’s PERFECT characterization.......cesspool. nailed it. oh yeah, I've heard absolutely ridiculous parts florida, straight care. speaking live. unable get test? extremely easy get test symptoms, do. Seattle able get test without appointment showing up, symptoms. 100% cherrypicked sound worse.  100% normal capacity, city prepared almost double amount normal ICU beds.  situation good following governor/president's advice lead disaster, another weeks.

Reaching 100% normal capacity cherry picked sound worse, genuinely horrific. Reaching 100% normal capacity literally absolute worst thing could happen hospital's normal capacity. 

Whatever case count now, trailing cases come exponentially higher, that's pandemics work. Hypothetically, government functioning should, reaching capacity would trigger lockdown. emergency capacity designed take overflow would inevitably come, since peak case count comes well lockdown commences.  


Filling normal capacity levels, relying emergency provisions moving stop increase cases simply exhausts safety provisions, ever slightly delaying inevitable, making inevitable considerably worse. lead disaster, another weeks.

That's maintain pace, control pandemics work. won’t. What's obvious result talking about? searches N95 masks last night, still inflated prices ebay also sure even buy since confiscated reaching expense. waste lot breath mecha-breath work? young person expect vaccinated till next year.

There young people vulnerable. Lots young folks genetic heart conditions, autoimmune disorders like. know concerns regards distributing vaccine vulnerable first based rushed nature development/testing. Vulnerable populations may greater risk rare long-term side effects, thoroughly studied usual due urgent nature pandemic. Ok contact info? many white people protesting black people. Even live primarily black city surrounding cities, lots lots white people protesting, more. bunch black people group call ""atttribute"" pandemic. willful ignorance, they’re trying ignore problems away... n=40 alright, better Moderna's partial initial preliminary tentative data 8 people (wtf). Animal studies are... animal studies. Disgusting trash. Sure, that's possible, I'm saying end pandemic MA, I'm taking win today. Yea don’t believe great blood pressure. virus deadly enough that.

Those people tend eat well tend unhealthy. Stereotype, know, kind true. ""this week virology"" podcasts lately doctor treats covid patients talking new treatments developed lately. steroids particular reducing mortality 30%, I'm sure that's part it, along testing people less severe symptoms. Even though huge uptick mask wearing following guidelines finally area Texas. going still major issue bit. long bad know. get waited till house completely fire get water. it? would take almost two years test entire country? Jesus.  let’s say I’m near Fayetteville, NC decide want go Boston. take 95, get gas New Jersey Pennsylvania, intend drive New York way without stopping New York going detain place fine prevent travel another state? Welcome double standards

Alas. mask already gave autism. 

/s actually long established protocols this. ""no uptick""

Ha! confuse accidental injury insurance life insurance. thing. There's mask says ""this mask useless governor"", lmao ER physician here, US though, draft document sorts guidelines, give framework decisions region. encouraged us give people scores based likelihood survival vents/beds ran short would prioritize vents better scores. discussed whether consider pulling vents to, structure discussion family. encouraged us frank scores, tell family front etc, keep matter fact, frequently update it. 

Then came works minister asked outright denied existence. Good know would back lol

At end day pull vent can't sues me, someone going protect me? Conversely refuse to?

**""There reason anyone walking around mask on""**

\-Anthony Fauci, March 2020 That's really point. Even personally got sick, evidently spreading broader community enough cause statistically significant bump. Whatever health risk put attending, seem kept spreading much outside protests. 

The lesson *lot* social things outside and, long wear mask practice social distancing generally take virus seriously (unlike, say, reopen protestors, concert/beach/bar-goers, people refusing wear masks, etc).

Also, anecdotal, know quite people attended protests almost deliberately self-isolating since. Multiple gyms refusing close anyway. either cities? San Francisco tiny. New York gets millions people three states 3 airports It’s projected get almost bad New York October 1, though. realize large portion black men can't shave, muslim men shave religious reasons. go see, explain should. mean white men beards? matter. Trump changes position (due banks), cult immediately switch position start preaching us also wear masks inside home. Yeah, servers get sick inconsiderate customers start contaminating food. ordering take-out point. think may stop now. feel like everyone listening Fauci beginning he’s run single father trying get kids stop licking swing set one knows damage permanent not. think safest assume know. take chances to? easy wear mask. mean, period time could afford house trademan salary that.

but yeah, thats marketting reality, causee also needed waspy male. messed thing workers allowed say anything it. know I'm not. Yeah totally legit asking info lol. feeling Carlin. mean airlines can’t operate unless passengers 6 feet apart? Oh sure, it’s like USA basically everywhere, looking China think stay contained 3 states. It’s eventually going spread country. Unless find vaccine.  “ People afraid go hospital due insane prices” Really hits hard. Anybody else see movie ""Sorry Bother You""? I’m Arizona mom’s friend called restaurant basically told this. mom angry call, especially mutual friends nurses tell really happening.  Lol, like Europe reopening US suddenly realized something yes, much issue now. Stores get raided, Amazon delivery services mostly scaled demand now. March lucky find delivery availability tried every day day 2 weeks.

Plus restaurants still open. Though suspect Ducey maybe shuts dine-in Thursday.

That said, never got point driving 12 stores around town, went one bought different things. Surely Wisconsin hospitals overrun long you’ve open car air conditioning? Americans leadership deserve. Democracy work. enforced Spain. Shops tell leave without one. Police fine $100. 90% voluntary mask-wearing almost beginning mandatory though. might again. Last weekend way packed standard [AZDHS click hospitalization.

However, low income area, I'd wager high percentage (certainly, higher percentage super thought, given reaction surveys) Internet. Maybe high 30%. Luckily, lot phones. vast majority students 0 work. knew they'd still pushed next grade ""extraneous circumstances"". 

The week, district dent survey parents teachers would like come back. included options like hybrid, online only, full in-person, well questions important cleaning, social distancing, masks were. 

As today, district still laid sort plan. course, plan would made must changed, start date August 14. 

Given culture education area, teachers barely meet curriculum even regular school year. switch hybrid online only, much less work going get done, kids going fail, lessons even behind schedule make awkward transitions. Still July get protests still going on.... still hear helicopters portland night things going here.

1. currently *proof* COVID-19 gives lasting immunity. best guess might gives lasting immunity, there's enough doubt maybe bet much lasting immunity.

Instead, we're held arm's length rest world second spike almost certainly hit us hard. Can't school shootings school. *(taps temple)* Cool walk street totally naked junk flapping breeze constitution says huh? knew? I’ve always said apply logic minimum wage also. Governor Senator whomever, force lowest salary community (or hell, even median salary). see it’s like living less $30k year, maybe they’ll invest communities instead maybe they’ll actually fucking raise minimum wage. free sue anyone sees fit. wonder bit press gives name governor. suing state institution governor role government, Mr. Ducey personally, personal feud?

If government, first one get sued gyms, Germany [has share Let's see courts find.

The German court decided decision indeed arbitrary government would close businesses first social distancing impossible like hair beauty salons. didn't, gym closure rejected court. Err remember Illinois already went surge right? like Texas Florida never went surge going happen..... surge already happened decline. Whether 2nd one happens air right now, State yet surge go 2nd surge also. 
On national level, started getting close 30,000 new coronavirus cases per day beginning April. also started 1,000 deaths per day time, jump 2,000 per day end April.

We stayed around 25,000-30,000 cases per late May, started trending 20,000 end May/beginning June. 

But deaths still trending downward. June averaging little 1,000 deaths per day, days well that. (And New Jersey adjustment added 1,800 deaths last week.)

Something clearly changed deadliness virus and/or ability treat it. Although northern suburbs Melbourne beginning potential second wave, rest country pretty much covid-free, cases hotel quarantine. one (link article) they've already raised $30k one day! Shows pandemic headed usa. give minds majority population scratching doors inside month. 

People age 35 wear masks. political statement wear I've weak law enforcement receive enough backlash thus far. saying wrong, man, that's Houston needs right now. Yes, basic human identification, in: ""These people look like people."" 

I say bad, tho. Yeah it’s that, safety net sucks Americans aren’t financially secure, get sick, many still need go work avoid financial ruin. They’re literally incentivized quarantine spread further. There’s lot talk u said, it’s definitely relevant people got sick quarantine said fuck it, definitely includes young people. however, majority Americans still favor lockdown control thing states don’t want can’t pay unemployment extended period. It’s lot factors rolled it, end result we’re legit fucked, 0 faith country get virus spread control. Spain, whilst virus gone, life feels pretty normal honest. areas roll back bit due local outbreaks, apart mandatory masks, generally go life normal. However, tourists arriving, idea that's going affect things. Idiocy.

He could also save money bother trying end suffering polio.

Jesus Christ people fucking stupid. one person tried warn us lot stop pandemic.

Your comment joke friend. shittiest healthcare I’ve ever seen living many different countries.

TEMPORARY shutdowns worked extremely well many countries, many returned ‘normal’ without big surge cases.

The country completely fucked chance suppressing virus, places success ones stricter restrictions match ground truth charts. shutdown, masks everywhere, people flip stupid it. numbers collapsed two months virus lost access. mean even rocket science. starve out, deal something overwhelm hospitals infection rates. Statues around whole begun erected honor heros yourself. absolutely reference lynching. commenter responding obtuse. China deserves much resentment?

44 deaths officially, okay. high many locations high amount virus community spread. far know Netherlands doesn’t current high levels community spread. East side Tennessee work.


They open business. mask seen. Everyone's vacationing Gatlinburg middle week. Grocery stores open season. know, never going end. Lol Apparently grocery store store manager ask someone put mask on? whenever see someone without mask pretty much same. Back pedal try ask something try answer quickly they’ll way.  Cases trending like, 10 days, major spike really started June 23rd / 24th.... see big increase deaths within next week so, I'll say testing case load virus situation worsening, least we're dodging bullet basically young people getting infected overall cases (for now..).

At time though, deaths cases trending country half-way decent job handling this... Even increased testing, EU, Canada, Aus/NZ, trending # cases, whilst testing ramped considerably. gf tested Friday dodger stadium. got results Saturday got Sunday. I'm negative positive. employer shady situation rest company. company want retest would cause different situation company. 

We know came gfs coworker positive rest fam. 

The oral test 70% accurate. Think screwed numbers really course do. Bring lawsuits, happens everywhere gets shut down. Honestly, think reporter coronavirus task force made feel like dumbass. ended Q&amp;A portion pointed Trump administration appeared actively discouraging people following CDC guidelines crowded, mostly maskless, campaign events.  *Mmmmmm* yes that's good stuff. appreciate coming back humoring me.

I think important thing pointed population density. That's huge advantage Texas definitely overlooked. sure employer would approve lol....

Good idea though. Worth considering... Yep, look news story things control there. (Canadian) lived US five years. great insurance relative Americans, yet still find health care system disgrace. awful, inhumane system, mention insane inconvenience pretty much everyone. true that's impossible track report on.
And hospitalization reported on.
Many states report ICU capacity regular basis (my state does, many don't).
That unfortunately leaves Deaths one serious measure currently tracked. America stop flying patients Mexico Joe Exotic method lol Damn got tested last Friday results less 24 hours later.. True, cases important thing we’re seeing context COVID, 28 percent ICU beds COVID-confirmed patients. situation ICU beds-- vast majority non-COVID cases,"" said Also COVID patients brought Riverside neighboring Imperial County, surge worse. fail see adult-facilitated distance learning year, bring catastrophic collapse human growth intellect culminating riots describe.

You’re putting catastrophic spin said. Obviously society continue function always has. point today’s generation children comparatively worse going forward you’re naive think won’t impact anything. Riots happen even best times far less. need enough pissed people nothing lose. solution everyone 65 ill stay indoors indefinitely? Really?

If alternative lowest-risk groups disproportionately bearing brunt coronavirus disruptions indefinitely, yes, without second’s thought - old ill far less lose simply staying home. 

I don’t even children obliged care someone else’s ‘precious offspring’ condescendingly put it, obliged care random old people never met, least yourself. children, however, welfare would understandably - unforgivingly - sole priority, you’re damn right I’d concerned development education, possibility decrepit old person getting live extra (low-quality) 5 years something else inevitably takes them. Stop spamming. happe.. oh yea bars sex spring time holiday.  don’t think planning kids local district wear masks. may change, right doesn’t seem case.

Mission Accomplished!! call vendors working beaches shut encourage support idiots go out? know handful food/umbrella/chair rental areas may open. Yeah, could say bad things Bush Patriot Act. numerous times made clear disagreeing Bush bad law never would mean ""You support terr'rists!"" Unfortunately, seeing many peope wearing masks NY past week so, many businesses caring compliance anymore. I'm scared second wave coming NY end July. I'm going edit literal words place emojis! mom loves president incredibly germ-phobic. think brain right must equivalent cat falling tree slice buttered toast strapped back. Lol...what's even pathetic Chinese economy pretty much tied US economy well.

As much like bicker Americans, fucked pretty much fucked long term well...... thought Sweden Finnish this. feel you. San Antonio got emergency alert every cell phone asking folks please knock fuck stay home, got hopes people would start taking seriously stop killing other. Still hoping. hugs phase 4 need shut flu even able spread humans

Edit: Grammar Southeastern VA rise cases. Virginia Beach full license plates hotspot neighbors. mask ""mandate"" fancy suggestion people treating such. headline misleading read article. I'm going see there's dashboard. Headlines read Texas hit 100% TMC media fails leave baseline capacity, ppl hallways capacity. first line article leads believe cases here. TMC listed Phase 1, non pandemic capacity ICUs moderate concern.

Riverside County intensive care unit beds nearly hit capacity Sunday, patients occupied 99% normal number beds.


The ICU 35% COVID19 patients. 

This good article understand ICU patient looks like general public believes due life death conditions. average stay ICU patient 3.4 days stigma country fact still idiots think mask-wearing something politics. U can't hide u want whole city help u contact trace. People live vacuum. quarantine 14 days. Offenders issued ""A warning."" maybe licenses pulled given large fine others would start take seriously. Make examples folks start this. get warning incentive business right thing innately give shit already. surge capacity. means beds floors available ICU uses.

What think happens half hospitals west south forced use ""surge capacity?"" failure biblical proportions making, two weeks time. Yeah shutting whole economy isn’t one Oooookkkkk, think probably relax go clicking links useless information literally one would looked twice 6 months ago. Ad revenue must generated somehow, I'm glad feel strongly part. 😘 worries someone who's moving NYC apts small can't home equipment lol

Hope gyms horrific dude describes There's lot misinformation air conditioning spreading virus. Air conditioning (or fan) blow droplets towards people. there's zero evidence coronavirus able survive centralized air system and/or infecting people room someone coronavirus. article much blame air conditioning blame lack fresh air flow due businesses conserving energy closing windows running AC. 

Masks still best weapon have, office space many people, eventually need eat get drink point stagnant air might take breath Coronavirus lingering environment. 

But agree even airflow cause massive outbreak everyone wears masks obeys social distancing. It’s funny people arms kids missing school it’s going impact when, least US, kids school three months EVERY year thought impacts development. 

As someone needs routine momentum work/kids/friends order maintain healthy mental attitude, sympathize people crying mental health extent. really, get new hobbies. You’re prison. reason haven’t seen article article posted that! People taking way lax Vancouver. Lots people ignoring social distancing, masks, many unnecessary business opening (one strip clubs outbreak - still don’t understand strip clubs open right now).

I knew Americans selfish entire life, really never imagined people would refuse one simple thing help fight disease kills people everyday African countries also tie currency Chinese yuan days. think replacement dollar slowly begun already. would say administration's strong suit. Previous administrations would handled health crisis much proactive childish manner. Looks like already reaching older people Florida Bet noone predicted Vietnam best lol answer question name, entire article call clickbait. nonsense designed look like serious argument, part nonsense written someone know they're talking about. say gym owner going sue governor, actually mean understand legal system much German person looking outside does.

You think people upset able sit meal Red Lobster weeks really want go sit jail wearing mask?


And easy, Karen's ask speak whoever charge, lead paddy wagon, remind right remain silent, bring jail, let speak judge there's opening.


It awesome, get released weeks get start whining awful treatment jail was, start demanding change jails run. think started voting system, inevitably leads two big parties, low voting turnout black white type politics viewing world. America shitty country long time. Americans finally catching on. good start, think need factor bunch Americans giant assholes would still throw fit wear masks even got fined. Hell, I’m willing bet there’s fair share police officers America would deliberately enforce mask laws. you’re big city, whole bunch places. old lady country died week 40 days hospital.

Another nursing home 70 sick patiens 25 sick workers bit 2 hospital last week, 10, ICU one ones ICU worker.

It's slow disease unfortunatly deaths likely trailing. first skeptical Vietnam could contain Covid-19. proved completely wrong. impressive accomplishment! Jesus.... Yup, one us sure. anticipate throwing shit fit asked wear mask, unironically tried police black person's behavior. American way. mean vitamin supplements 1) can't hurt unless people really, really overdo them, 2) someone really, really low levels definitely help (since very, low levels associated higher mortality). think that's part reason reading story. Cases like pop fairly regularly normally gain traction story received. Editors quite enjoying this.  part true, completely disagree corelation covid high meat consumption. could started way become pandemic it. became bad sheer human malice &amp; incompetence. one government caused it. many government ignored enough. bad one person ate bat. bad hundreds thousands morons taking it, scientific advice it.

Every country, every city, every street, anytime gets bad, thats common denominator. Morons causing worldwide deaths. Wearing mask washing hands apparently much ask for. local grocery store(Kroger) put signs Mask Requested

About 10% employees wearing maybe 5% customers.

They placed direction arrows isle first lockdown, yet see anyone obey including employees.

Northern Panhandle WV New Zealand, South Korea, Germany others key vis educating friends/relatives right thing, enjoy life without new measures again.

*Ahem* Generation X.

My mom boomer 25 1972. Even so, wearing mask isn’t guaranteed invulnerability COVID. Social distancing number one way slow spread yo see protesters marching shoulder shoulder. Plus even wear mask, protection goes window rib hand eyes get COVID way, forth. county religious exemption mask wearing. say elective surgeries ""causing surge"". said certainly contributing total number patients ICU, would less could procedures done March / April / May ""covid surge"" Texas throw IFR window

Is facts fit narrative?

I dispute covid hits someone hard, infection lasts longer regular flu, end hospital often stay longer. Point taken.

As complications, happen diseases. get fibrosis flu, though rare - like complications covid rare, they're widely reported since everyone terrified.

You're saying ""what bad things"" ignoring [80% 

I watch Fox news - try put box people like dismiss points. Under/overs 2020 going hard predict rate Hope springs eternal. think it’s like 5% - loud self righteous minority that’s pushing country straight fire pure blind rage ignorance. Trumps silent minority fools.

Thing freedom allows one fuck knuckle walk around AR15 around chest people don’t tell wear mask.... cool. 500 people encountered day, freedom exposed coronavirus, trust obviously insecure unstable individual maintain control weapon, completely violated. cancel snow days dumbest hill die on. course, find fundamentalists, uneducated, idiots gathered together right top.

I know let go, pretty sad watch.  need staff too. procedures equipment lot complications arise... patients need monitored trained staff handle many.... confirmed. hospital stopped elcetive cases month,and cut benefits higher earners furlough lot people. Ah OK know. France heard pcr nose thing! Rudy Gobert NBA player got March first player got league shut still feeling effects. says hes still feeling weak sense smell indeed lucky think reason protests aren’t talked source community spread relatively people taking part, relative whole community. 5,000 people marching outside masks would assume cause spread. it’s nothing compared potential spread caused daily habits overall population- could millions. It’s black white, I’m sure community spread occurred protests bars/restaurants/wherever opening early. focus government response might actually make difference slowing shit down. play game later. “It won’t happen here.”

Well well well, know? know joke everything Australia kill (and might) would definitely prefer bitten deadly snake spider (the biggest threat am) deal type bear. 

I mountain bike quite bit see lots roos out, even quite big ones, admit choice rounding corner running roo rounding corner seeing bear, I'll take roo everyday

And doubt though bears would feast happily roos, bigger concern would predator around would turn normally placid roos aggressive creatures too, I've seen enough know normally laid back, certainly ability fuck shit set mind Belgium Sweden counts similar way. PCR oral swabs, (a bit?) less accurate though. problem children high functioning circulatory system going see problems right generation may early onset heart disease organ failures disease. covid like driving people car go work? Would get fired? 99.3% America diagnosed.

Hmm yes, intelligent analysis right deep takes don’t really address problem exists governor douche. ironic, many attendees believe natural selection / evolution yet participate demonstration. Look, agree text flat disgusting, cant stress much agree people say shit like need made examples. making thoughts speech illegal, matter abhorrent things say are, really slippery dangerous slope. Don’t forget amendment guarantees right protest exact type mentality protects right send text well. cant one without possibility other. ever sent text hateful, racist asshole, treated like one. ostracized friend groups. face social consequences. even attempts made educate someone brave enough deal that. calling arrest someone saying words you, I, hope large majority country’s population feel disgusting (because is, Theres debate that) constructive, would probably make dig heels deeper garbage ideals. Locking people away doesn’t solve problem, teaches hide better makes harder rest us weed out. 

Now, without ado, feed downvotes. I’m hungry. YHUUUUUUGE    sorry. It’s logistically possible, many aspects plan would fail first week. two weeks ago. Deaths lag significantly. Boston Dynamics (owned Google) rolling commercial spot robots lately. I’ve sayin years. service industrial complex gonna implode point. Jokes aside need take long hard look restaurants operate ask really many. It’s ridiculous amounts food wasted. mention amount water wasted “clean” prep. Like seriously restaurants use ridiculous amount running water clean prep. know can’t one questioning existence modern society. feel like hot take going get downvoted lmao. Semi-rural coastal California here, solid 30 percent people still wearing masks inside stores/market(that explicitly giant sign saying masks required)/hardware stores etc. effect child responsible death parent grandparent? Oh, that's government too. First restaurants outdoors, restaurants 51%+ food revenues bars/restaurants indoors, bars open. I'm guessing reverse would true second, staggered closing.

We right flattened many places suddenly government (Quebec) tried move WEEKLY data dumps last week. quickly flipped backlash great. Also, testing dropping off. would like see Sentinel testing targeted widespread testing max capacity alas, no. reeks. Unfortunately, lots words trigger auto-deletion sub, including ones referring major parties US! good job figuring despite emojis showing! People making clear since whole thing started thing anyone cares deaths. Public opinion seems either die remain perfectly healthy. Isn’t 44 deaths proof death totals still falling? manage come China tho... lmfao virus lingers around restaurants bars. Since death less threat dunno, liberal democracies like Italy (known horrific corrupt government) it? choice getting welded indoors go get corona tubing weekend. ... eyes wide shut author („Tyler Durden“, subtle) huge chip shoulder labeled conspiracy theorist doesn’t understand difference „possibly uses similar mechanisms HIV evading detection“ „shares exact genetic material HIV therefore probably created chinese lab HIV“. Read article again: nowhere quoted texts (except quote themselves) say SARS-CoV-2 HIV share genetic material. That’s 100% fabrication authors. closest gets viruses using surface protein attach many cells body, it‘s stated unique two viruses. Also: know another virus weakens immune system killing immune cells?
Hint: it’s measles.
Do think measles also created lab somewhere?
As side note, railing fact checkers (like author) likely make trusting. Even you’re suppressed overzealous censors, anyone able agree social media full fake news fact checkers important limiting spread that.

Please don’t take personal insult, sharing article factual doesn’t seem like good idea me. funny Berlin also didnt get hit all.

Even though tons traffic/tourists France, Italy, etc, February March.

And even though whole neighbourhoods ignored lockdown.

And even though big anti-lockdown protests 1000s people streets masks far back March.

And say ""Germany testing right"". certainly didnt seem different. big ""push"" tested Berlin Berlin Facebook group people tested.

And things open secret techno parties etc etc etc.

But somehow .. big Covid problem Berlin.

Hard explain. announced April medical personnel would take priority.

On April 20, welcome ceremony return CDC medical aid team Beijing, Chinese CDC Director, Chinese Academy Sciences' According Dr. Galford, depending trend epidemic, population, medical staff, may given first aid end year case emergency. New Crown Vaccine. timeline vaccine development, Gover said normal process followed, may end today early next year . epidemic going badly, may given people, medical personnel, end year use emergency situation. regard, specifically stressed must used emergency situations, ordinary healthy people. entirely privilege though. Hard lock possible low income folks hardly resources last week, let alone 6 longer. way works lot stimulus payments. Never better b Intentional inaction. pay taxes actively undermine communities. According voters, working intended. provide data either. New York Times even stated argument lacks evidence. besides -- recessions cyclical. potential cause mean we'd go never recession without it. 

Meanwhile, several countries opening back took Covid seriously. economic fallout worse countries stayed open? I'm seeing data supports that.  also live, teach, tiny town Kansas... entire county couple cases total town I’m zero (zero confirmed, is). I’m person know town wears wearing masks public spaces. get weird glances, one said anything stupid/rude (yet). shutdowns never designed get rid disease; pause spread infection get surplus medical capacity place, produce adequate PPE hospitals, increase testing supplies get contact tracing place. Hopefully Chicago open. shutting *never* going get rid coronavirus, never intended to. Cases happen first. Deaths happen after. post age well. swear, “what though?” attitude huge amount Americans go else we’ll never get anything done. misappropriate data points present false narrative

Exactly. DA isolating. people think. Really. they? mean, he’s kind forced to. Can’t make money to-gos think least part lesson underestimate value cogent, united central leadership. 

Americans certainly capable coming together one fighting virus together. commander chief literally openly divides populace every turn. Even General Mattis said doing. Healthcare improved. 

It’s much public institutions failure bitterly split politics cloud decision making sides.

Our Economy pre-Covid pretty damn stellar, stocks always speculation market, financial market world. 

It’s odd people take giant shit country struggle list place they’d rather live. like 4-6 weeks. One week ICU admission 3 weeks ventilator. think likely things pick problem states 2 weeks so, probably see anything country's scale little bit due improvements NYC surrounding areas. sub group people think virus fake..... tend spread know rushed results work pushed funded leaders let 120K us die nothing lies misdirection

What nonsensical strawman. work researchers connected Trump. utter, weak nonsense. reopening plans generally supported according polls. Ah yes, outliers people get it. need stay home - vulnerable people simply cannot stay home healthy non-vulnerable do, must together. I'm gonna lie,I read several times understand point whatever emojis used squares computer. Get asshole ready. Gutsy comment. shark. Sharks winners, look back necks. Necks sheep Plus outside need mask, air recirculated staying stagnant building issue guy answers amazon questions ""I know"".

Thanks information one use. wanted say thank said well another sub got downvoted hard reason. would strongly disagree characterization benefit “minuscule.” You’re right gaps form masks wrong size aren’t put correctly. even situation, substantially particulate going blocked inhalation mask all. 

A seat belt won’t save car accident tuck buckle gap seats, rather correctly buckling it. people can’t figure wear mask, that’s says nothing effectiveness masks. people simply cannot saved incompetence. They're likely opening they'll go bankrupt gone forever. Expect come (bankruptcies is, also suppose businesses open maybe really be). sad thing already house cards economy going fall apart bankruptcies next recession, recession omfg going statistically worse recession great depression. overall life bad life great depression (pandemic issues aside), still, business perspective next years god awful.

So yeah, businesses trying kill anyone, opening literally option, close forever, sadly :( opinion maybe hospital billed $6000 insurance company first place. see everybody blaming insurance company look hospital's fault. That’s means. might want read link again. Obviously it’s less deadly young people, like almost every disease virus known man.

The flu still lower death rate 65 too.

You drastically need learn read. Congress shall make law respecting establishment religion, prohibiting free exercise thereof; abridging freedom speech, press; **or right people peaceably assemble**, petition Government redress grievances. bad city state refuse wear mask move leave area covid pandemic runs course. Collectivism. Like states make money states ""collect"" it!

Then say ""It's ok we're one country, we're happy help nice interstate help people get basic needs. welcome!"" everyone happy. virus affected children like affects elderly would taking much seriously. upsets people start losing minds children.  fight hard defeat this, yes, inconveniences, vulnerable risk. never said guaranteed real possibility China knows this, either way floods devastating country. mean pessimistic asshole going theme park right might make another one family members sick might die, too. hope rethink trip.

Cuz trust China’s infrastructure sanitation regulations keep control...or rest world mainland China need pork desperately? ""Urgent use"" China means military right judge whether use vaccine, necessarily whether use it.
In China, 2 groups people approved ""emergency use"", one health care workers second military. two groups approved groups highest risk exposure.
As example, Xinfaodi market outbreak, Beijing used military blockade market, businesses tested nucleic acid quarantined, PPL alone clearly enough.
Phase 2 trials shown vaccine least pose risk infection people, vaccine effective, protects military personnel risk exposure, vaccine ineffective, risk infection. absolutely right protect degree too, around wearing masks certainly enough depend on.

 might become apparent compare survival rates people hospitalized New York vs states. Note: live NYC, isn’t regional pride thing. 
 
I went run mill New York Times subscriber openly hostile almost everything they’ve tell coronavirus. find state data dashboards far useful. correct answer. rocket science find index fund call day.

The core issue people stare fund want, useless money put it. Self-Darwinism. mention. dealt adequately, like example European Asian countries. number new cases sufficiently low lot activities reopen again. get haircut again, kids soon go school sports (albeit without spectators site limited staff).

Sure things remain changed, like working home, easy international traffic big conventions happen need wear mask public places public transport. took 3 months moderate discipline really, although expect partial lock-downs new waves.

Edit: Accidentally submitted finished trying claim refugee status Canada United States would claiming Covid reason would claiming ANYTHING else makes Covid worse me. Economic disadvantage - race - atheism - ANYTHING. form discrimination persecution could massaged hook. 

And sometimes need lawyers. Covid spreading protests. There's already proof. reason pittsburg folks can't see cause spread asymptomatic due young age protesters. itll take time peoole spread ro older folks eho show symptims. Massachusetts protests collected samples people asymptomatic even. 

The article talks this. downplays effects cause politics media definitely spread. 2.5 percent covid actually quite serious depending size protest. local new paper said 8000 people attended protest one day. That's 200 people got covid one protesr. Statewide, max we've ever recorded getting covid 250 total state considered range virus growth considered uncontrolled grow exponentially best idea I’ve heard book cult Trump mask town hall video funny. OC seems like ""special"" place. Australian article. ""Why's NZ getting credit!"". death rate tracks 2-3 weeks behind infection rate. spike deaths April seemed long lead time true rate infections higher earlier thought testing shortages. I'm right, death rate start rising week next week. hope I'm right BTW. grandpa New Jersey would say 'you want knuckle sandwich?' dickhead little. like knuckle phrases sure. Classic wish luck. numbers alone they're gonna need it. think India's going Coronavirus strikes hardest. Perhaps Brazil well, over.  I'd always thought came stubborn... ""Don't mess Texas""; think right. think Florida going smart money. ship left harbour months ago, Mitch. captain got jazzed bennies crashed shit-filled titanic. like mass grave. hope hospital admissions stay low. hospitals live ICUs maxed out. Currently scrabbling convert units covid units. prepared first started census dropped. took away spend much money. talking surge plans nurses ratios scary things never thought could happen. quality care go immensely. course does. symptoms 2 weeks, everyone ill found amount time, go back fucking normal (with masks). used March US, we'd able enjoy fireworks apple pie summer, rather bleeding savings, edging side functioning alcoholism. national guards don’t wear masks either though.... I'd say line drawn deception. buy something billed warm coffee turns boiling fine, sue away. Fuckin administration psychopathic maniacs hurdling country deeper abyss. understand difference one Chinese paper (not peer-reviewed) hundreds research papers done numerous institutions around world based Wuhan data? seem skewed you? Chinese teams/papers/institutions estimated R0 high? Thanks Even think mild flu people asked wear masks, would. religious I'd probably use cheap disposable mask hurt wear shows courtesy. 

I've thought interesting countries wear masks flu season wondered would ever adopt it. Never expected happen way people resist much. problem already demonstrated bought (how corroborated China initial phases, taking word instead actual investigation).

Now Trump threatening pull funding WHO, survival depends people listening them.

How get someone pay attention? Tell something scary. point, idea whether believe say not. Yeah Mom rule working, seeking work, school. really appreciated knowing mom back needed it. Fat, drunk, retarded? 

Yea. pretty much sums up. need eye protection too. like first succeed, reopen state try Imo, qualifies doublespeak. Care standards, denying care people. surprised. People aren’t giving shit. government isn’t giving shit. I’m seeing beaches packed stores allowing dine-in pandemic hasn’t even near end. 

I expected said “going open things back slowly” *privatized healthcare enters chat* Gavin fuckin numpty. writing wall weeks ago. yet still let go on. better AZ TX FL. like well hits 80s care. Yeah, I’m Chicago think went soon indoor dining don’t think end well us. I’m rather annoyed mayor really caved one, playing safe much else. don’t know, seems pretty sketchy. makes think aren’t chips it? insight best idea I’ve heard book cult Trump still don’t know lasting effects disease. situation social distancing pier didn’t mask forgot (yes, know), anyways random person comes I’m unloading boat gets right face ask name’s Fred. I’m Fred said looks like mistook “fred”. apologized walked away. One thing though talking noticed spitty talker droplets got lips. wiped immediately afterwards I’m still paranoid. Could contracted Covid-19 disease this? I’m really worried right I’m quite fearful. Thanks anyone helping!! I've actually really enjoyed cooking home more. amazing easy lot cases actually tastes better. even really take time. Airlines started damn well gonna finish it! schools... forgot countries still people’s livelihoods. still lot people make income &amp; don’t ability go without work long. effects people’s lives lot different ways outside catching not. estimated 75,000 going die deaths despair, estimated 10,000 excess cancer deaths projected, many people lose houses life’s work savings forced shut business down? Haven’t worked 5 months &amp; Can’t keep staying home much longer without risk losing together. point people negatively impacted measures restrict coronavirus coronavirus. Quite simply, useless 90% population comply segregation measures 10% not.

The fact Chinese Americans quarantine home wait things get better (of course Chinese mandatory quarantine) government policy quarantine crucial.

I think Americans given possibility government might able control coronavirus, kind like NBA's worst team losing purpose get better draft picks.

Coronavirus give anyone draft pick. want say late never late imagine bunch people got sick. July: Hospitals become overwhelmed, people start dying reasons COVID-19 due lack hospital access. Peak goes far higher before. Testing fails enough kits go around. Governors refuse reinstate lockdowns due economic damage

August: Complete collapse medical system hottest zones imminent. Deaths surpass 1 million climbing rapidly. Total confirmed cases reach 10 million, actual closer 30, one ten Americans infected point. Officials point fingers other, forced reinstate lockdowns. COVID-19 related looting begins minor rebellions break cities.

September: 1 4 Americans infected. Health systems everywhere collapsed. Martial law instated due revolts, looting, unrest. people know least one person died disease. United States stands brink collapse.

October: Pestilence, Famine, War, Death

If people start taking seriously, possible trajectory outbreak US. said court? customer call assholes know can't. Reading post history, genuinely believe every state business requiring mask solely get kick us ""comply"" orders? 

Is really theory..? That’s norm Monday, numbers usually day behind IE low testing numbers you’re seeing really represent Sunday Monday. Tomorrow telling, buckle up...I don’t good feeling Density probably across valley lots bigger Phoenix proper built '70s got smaller grew out. whole thing port-midcentry suburbia. everyone stopped kids right now, human race would extinct 100 years. Maybe that's people want though, dunno.

I'm 36 gave waited long kids. consider selfish all. Yeah, definitely cool here. Temperatures keep rising PGE already warned expecting scheduled blackouts day now. two 17 year olds. already told graduate high school, free continue live home. require either continue education work (or both) help expenses can. rule oldest (living European country getting job there). jerk (or not) taught long time kid leave nest. need close restaurants, gyms, hair nail salons, malls, movie theaters ASAP. spreading like wildfire.

Complete failure leadership. Protests....... Fair game told take 1000-2000IU day Kansas mask mandate starts Friday 3rd. Probably little late, better all. havent hit bad patch, bad patch (and good while, like pig holler). feel like point we're digging pond waiting ducks. understand basic principals trust health officials doctors. example think masks somehow reduce immune system getting exposed virus somehow beneficial. Ok lump amorphous idea mainstream media claim 

""world one even two sided. simple stop thinking is.""  friend works place polling, including push polls. According him, somebody AZ fuckton push polls pandemic trying convince people safe reopen immediately, lock Maricopa county.

I fear state. big money players looking keep open, even means people die. 51 deaths like billion people.  /s always morbidly obese white men. Mexico considered latin American north American country Bullshit. Stop. Spreading bullshit. work hospitals there. lying someone lied you. Orange County. Got excited bc saw photo like “THATS TOWN” read headline got bummed “that’s town...” 😔 What’s hard wear mask? makes feel good knowing simply wearing mask, protect around me. Need people/businesses start installing UV kits. Pretty affordable kills everything including viruses/allergens etc. makes sense. amount unironic ""This end/We fucked"" comments

It's bad made [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/coronavirusvirus) back March chronicle utter insanity.

I least bit surprised find America's coronavirus issues caused bunch psychotic doomers intentionally spreading around. Need bootstrap stimulus check PR BS, taking heat filling planes leaving empty seats trying show care health screening... Screenings almost useless. read 40 percent Covid positive people pass basic screening (including asymptomatic). already LA county it’ll take lot stop this.  might weakest example journalism slash best example fear mongering ive ever seen. 

I’m gonna tell something that’s going blow mind... somewhere country someone doesn’t even know “expose” 200 people today. What’s realistic example here? happen dozens times? Hundreds? OH.....! beauty rapid fire bullshit like can't rebutted meaningful way, certianly real time. time pull facts chips fitting needle whatever, basic stuff, audience whatever nonsense want spread next.

""See, can't 100% sure mind control ray. need PROVE MEEE RESEARCH"" bars liquor licenses revoked businesses shut down. owners banned ever opening bar again. also put jail. people treated like murderers known beginning US outbreak...oh wait...WTF *hol up* talking friend went family graduation party said, ""My family give virus!"" People get it. dunno camp fall I'm going flatter think decision kids directly leading downfall America New Jersey, Florida New England. doesn’t sound right all. Sounds like you’re saying average per 100,000 population 8,300 cases per day. case we’d herd immunity one week. Covid19 looooooooves beach closures Dope truck though  new restaurant guidelines, going protest someone offers McConnell seat dumpster back. incredibly selfish person. Enjoy watching suffer death world. least raised right though. posting flashback worth listen - Feburary 25 - US 51 cases (mostly travelers Wuhan) 0 deaths. Still Dr. Nancy Messonnier foresaw widespread community infections possible severe disruptions everyday life. Trump apparently almost got fired muzzled - never included Coronavirus taskforce meetings. - 4 months 125,000 deaths later somehow feels like many people still get it. I’m honestly glad it’s happening now. county gained 11 cases week. Sure lot, worry me. Rich countries tend old. median age Ghana 21, median age corona victim 80. can't blame Newsom. Board Supervisors, local governments, populace rebelling. drank water fountain today lake park children play. fucked? 

Can healthy immune system fight fucker chance activate? Appreciate hard work getting us details. Well get Orange Menace office tad better. taco talk, please? Say again. Illinios:Worse Florida Virus spreader goes brrrrrr invested 700million company uses rfid vaccine technology......
smart move buddy Santa Barbara too. trash beaches : ( Meanwhile school district considering opening August masks optional, 3 foot social distancing instead 6 (both impossible), unpaid leave absence teachers don’t want return...ugh test numbers down. test numbers cases, though, positivity rate up. Here's thing though: want people suffer debilitating illness and/or die. mean, cant. PA 3 month complete lockdown major parts(Philadelphia), reopened slowly, seeing rise cases. Yes is. proved way back January. 

It wasn't. That's point. distinctive specific symptoms COVID-19. distinctive specific symptoms COVID-19, COVID-19 diagnosis cannot suitable serving valid gold standard. 

What required first virus isolation/proof? first need know RNA PCR tests calibrated comes from. 

Particle purification essential pre-requisite proving existence virus, thus prove RNA particle question comes new virus. done.

This relates PCR testing PCR tests calibrated gene sequences (in case RNA sequences SARS-CoV-2 believed RNA virus), know gene snippets part looked-for virus. know that, correct isolation purification presumed virus executed. 

But done. proof origin virus genome viral-like particles cellular debris, pure impure, particles kind. words, existence SARS-CoV-2 RNA based faith, fact. ##MAGA Ouch. Stay safe there. Shame you, reckless, non mask wearing shitheads California. well opened decided tired virus. know work way. can't put time limit virus become inconvenient you. much know misinformation created, possible trace origin false message? assume serve certain agenda - want economy open profit, downplay seriousness virus, like particular political figure need undermine influence policy, etc. assume false information simply thought places around world, concerning easy spread false message. exponential, even ""quiet"" reporting days :( Numbers tripling every two weeks.

Previous Mondays....

Yesterday: 5,266

June 22: 2,926

June 15: 1,758

June 8: 966 Interesting... hold events like news conferences round tables, spend entire time congratulating complementing other.

If ever grandchildren, I'm going enjoy explaining MyPillow guy. governor money, business. goes huge dinners attends Trump rallies. could give fuck less people. question hesitant use term pandemic, Tedros touched issue used word use lightly carelessly. word that, misused, cause unreasonable fear, unjustified acceptance fight over, leading unnecessary suffering death,”

In fact, one reasons longer uses term official alert status system. view among public health specialists term lead national governments believe nothing stop outbreak. used term, also word use lightly carelessly. word that, misused, cause unreasonable fear, unjustified acceptance fight over, leading unnecessary suffering death,”

You also remember term used numbers became shortly after. Tedros said number days countries reporting large numbers cases, 115 countries reported cases. Twenty-one countries reported one case. five countries reported cases reported new cases past 14 days

I think lot people taking position level hindsight appropriate kind assessments. Ultimately, decision use term 11th March judgement call. experts would said sooner, later. gather public health expert. critique seems based solely fact national governments react quickly enough contain virus term pandemic used DG. I'd also point fact many national governments acting sufficiently well March 11th, including US. again, can't see argument holds all. based deep understanding public health, really critique national governments WHO. think maybe mean enter seated. lot restaurants lines since lower capacities, people forced wait table. would make sense wear mask seat. guys discussing much? answer yes. Also, he's old. It’s everywhere man. Everywhere masks required, there’s pushback. honestly downright comical point. coworker get called Nazi asking someone put mask entering building. I’ve young people roll eyes tell need mask. People don’t care don’t get feel like US gets focus excluding ton countries too. Considering US highest number cases + rising, surprising all. suffered hell dont wanna get back it, masks.

LA etc yet feel hell Im surprised seem care Really, can’t say Or**ge either?!? Masks 100% effective, therefore even everyone 60,00-person throng wearing one still viral transmission. inconsistent defend protests criticizing people want businesses opened. Scale 41k tests 70k tests last week that's 10,500 positive cases. That's first order approximation getting better. RemindMe! 10 days I'm asking *who enforces this?*

Because answer cops, work way think does.

And answer minimum wage sub minimum wage workers, ask hate people make like $4/hr pretty awful make police people determine tips. create 

The quotes grabbed wikipedia / books / news articles last place Earth want inside dining room bunch morons think makes sense eat dining room people right now.

It's like old Groucho Marx joke joining club would member. Fuck. Positivity rate continues rise well. must say pleasantly surprised people live. fucking rock stars masking socially distancing. actually know media age people getting virus gone down. 

All know media age CONFIRMED CASES gone down. happen extent simply testing people months ago, catching less-serious cases (skewing younger) instead serious cases (skewing older.) Yes. Routine testing high-risk workers high risk areas may better allocation resources. Randomly testing one person helpful opinion. god made nano bots, shadow masters watching polls McConnell big lead 15%+. loses, blowout Biden means GOP lost swing states like Texas Georgia. possible, pretty unlikely. know is??

Thanks! far GA 2800 deaths rhe average like 25 deaths per day friends past weekend walking Gypsy Kitchen apparently place completely packed guy invented Windows underestimates dumb Americans we’re really fucked. agree, people see someone young looks great think “low risk”.

I’ve got 20 year old son looks like epitome health. not. half heart (single ventricle) high risk. People greatly underestimating many vulnerable citizens among us - autoimmune diseases, diabetes type 1, cancer treatments, congenital heart disease, etc. people old frail looking, much risk. *we* pay Great Canada Wall? D. J. Treason getting Mexico pay one Remember, sense entitlement non-mask wearers enormous. getting people. I'd love hear even *one* example someone ardent anti-masker changed tune wants everyone wear mask. “But I’m American, rights!” wearing mask yard work.....? Also every conservative anti-mask; need grow are. still get couple regulars tipping extra, overall people unhappy us constantly sanitize everything end leaving small tips. much GOPish complain something personally impacted it:

- Abortion horrible loved one personally needs abortion. 

- Affordable health care needed cancer facing bankruptcy - travesty oppressed.

... OMG. leopard voted ate face! Hmmm, believe saw something European countries opening China soon, long China willing reciprocate. think netherlands lowered riskfactor EU yellow(OK, active countermeasures lik social distancing). Sweden UK exceptions stuff outside Europe. live shore you’re visiting? Good you! can't even imagine taking hike Pubidoux heat mask on. saw dude running steep side years ago altitude training mask on. Insane! 40k tests done Monday. That’s 30k fewer last Friday. 

It seems DeSantis realized one way control numbers simply restrict amount testing done. It’s infuriating. Okay? That's like saying ""well car accident fatal, put seat belt"". Putting mask takes fcking 0 effort good every one. need worry, already stocked supplies. Multipurpose hoarding! point, thing would work would total lockdown complete contact tracing completed. happened last lockdown. long forming huddle

within 10 minutes Lol sure mean, masks aren’t 100% protective. isn’t unexpected. Can't tell trying funny take everything literally lol  suspect death rate rn infected late May early June Baseball around corner let guess pushing political narrative? mask help totally prevent virus, also seem suggesting millions people wore mask, wore mask entire time obviously video watch zero social distancing

your post pretty disingenuous

&amp;#x200B;

it's borderline shilling, obviously protest contributing rise cases denial troubling often outright lies political partisanship seems like hypersensitive Covid given husband baby weren’t positive. people taking pictures could never known given ended symptoms she’s clearly vulnerable others. Probably humanizes pain virus causes. obvious people desensitized numbers. Articles like remind people :

1. virus effect everyone regardless age 

2. side effects strangely mentioned often articles read seem number focused.

We know virus without media's help. Look states crisis right - leadership rejected scientific reports media reporting around world. Media important role.  
Oh shit, seconds googling showed completely wrong was. apologize profusely Captain America.

Don't know bother sources you. Included kiddie pool full sand stick head in, extra charge.

Rural police infrastructure proper mask less stuffy makeshift mask. got KN95 masks believe N95 material made N95 standard cups face well thicker loops ears surgical mask have. Also, ear protectors hold ear loops around neck instead ear helps fatigue. 

If wear surgical mask 20 minutes jaw start hurting it’s tight presses bad place me. right accessory better fitting mask go hour two without much fatigue. It’s definitely different takes getting used doable. worth discomfort safety brings others myself. think that’s real issue. It’s don’t think mask would protect someone, somehow. That’s really simple. Even perfect put wall people poof, separated. it’s fact they’re taking virus seriously threat others level discomfort worth don’t believe it’s real thing really harmful, bother. sane person would think safe choice travel US right now. virus spreading crazy R/ wholsome sigh... idiots wearing masks hurt themselves, hurting others. care. spike time, infection rates directly result infection control measures. places early spikes spread happening knew shut opened very, carefully, universal masking, social distancing, limited indoor things, etc, etc. local decision, feds never done anything help. places spiking shut decided bothered went back normal. people wanted keep smoking restaurants states enacted smoking bans. freedom exposed coronavirus

There freedom, there’s freedom see someone streak ballgame.

Illness, viruses, etc part life accept risk living.

You protect best ability one else obligated forced too. problem ""all needed"" downplays massive challenge it. easy reddit say ""we done safely"", anyone working public health would tell you, people stupid can't educate way healthy habits. point even crucial masks, level mask wearing needed prevent cases escalating threatening hospitals insanely high frankly impossible obtain. US % points behind countries mask-wearing, magic bullet. 

If assumption held people introduced lockdowns early ""it matter virus still around us reopen we'll able educate people wearing masks/behaving responsibly times"", frankly people delusional. It’s like didnt even read comment describe feature daily journalism works. Scholars talk reporters sources ""co-produce"" news routine structures like beat system, often practice end privileging sources deemed authoritative newsworthy, politicians governments, even always expert. Much time, work well, efficient, become problematic means journalists ignoring better qualified sources letting authorities drive narrative. 


To fair, journalists editors generally aware problems trying counter. Dorothy Byrne, senior editor UK, large part getting COVID-19 coverage right diverse newsroom journalists data skills expertise, prioritizing getting direct access primary sources, often health care -- understandable busy pandemic always keen talk news media! likely transmission one suggested
 - ""We leaving house go walk. Sometimes, maintain distance, would push Rosie’s stroller bike lane street. make decisions every time go out: danger oncoming car people around us aren’t wearing masks walking dogs? best, can’t always stay six feet apart sidewalk.""

She got contact pedestrian. mean real problem hospitals themselves? gettin vaccine tho long looks things. Hey, anybody remember US like, ""Masks? Ridiculous! nothing may even _increase_ risk!"" WE’RE NUMBER 1!!! ^in ^coronavirus ^cases  Actually no.
 Floridas odd testing goes. Numbers lower Sunday even lower Monday. Moves Tuesday Wednesday thursday alot Friday peaks Saturday. Cases amd testing follows pattern data reported previous day wonder much would change sort pandemic ubi implemented. feel lot parents unfairly forced corner. universal healthcare Massachusetts. settled matter like, 2006. I've subsidized plans before, nice know there's bit safety net lose job/job provide plan. 

Really know much resistance shit across country. Nobody implanted camera brain threatened take away machine guns/sniper rifles/civil war cannons going MassHealth. everyone afraid of? Maybe mind business bother anyone wearing mask. Let deal decisions.... Give government inch take mile, start tracking people, never stop. Texas doesn’t care anything isn’t BBQ, oil Football. worked well pandemic came along People protests wear masks, masks SIGNIFICANTLY reduce spread, protests corrupt system.

Are saying despite infectious disease wear masks? reason? Also death rate entirely known yet, worldwide cases ended 8% ended death US 10%. 130k people dead can't bothered try slow putting mask hours? 2020: ""Best 7-8 Mag. Earthquake, Wildfires, second Pandemic Yellowstone Supervolcano erupting."" That's quality title gore right Anecdotally, religious folk circle acquaintances happen least concerned wearing masks. children ones playing w others without masks call reason so. 

I really don’t understand it. wish people understood this. 

Hell, Florida still adding deaths April days ago. low risk interpreted it

 ut even Fauci fessed House feds make laws say gotta wear pants outside public, use seatbelt, drive right side road, obey speed limit, but..............wearing mask beyond power federal government?

Explain please LOL Virus: Yes, CAN. got likely immunity it, least little while. course, consequence him. C*nt. Same. No. Cloth masks good too. Here's instructions CDC masks home. require sewing. There's excuse wear mask Good thing we've got global warming issues, we're saved! Newsom call 14,000+ ventilators? leaders? could share source chart? Many poor people, relatively poor people, i.e., without several months savings, facing looming threat unemployment running without renewal arrears rental debt obligations coming due. Additionally another constitutional crisis happening November approaching country likely face severely polarized, inevitably chaotic time. point, coordinated top-down response COVID something forget about, maybe state bailouts blues, maybe not. it’ll go courts takes time, happen delay normal poor people getting screwed.

The markets represent minority population, population economy whole. Rises due perceived future buying opportunities now, perceived future value firms aside number tech industry they’re geographically locked.
In short, I’d love share optimism, however life finance medicine lead believe overwise. Northern Irish girl, felt bones. clinging shit show? another option! counties overturn it. There’s several 0 cases she’s banking ones ignore it’s Kansas dumbass somewhere county cases gonna turn lot cases what's likelihood positive partner tests negative covid 19? Important note sit-down restaurants still open one worst offenders spreading virus. Lots people packed room one wearing masks eat. sit well 2020. mean, people lived prior air conditioning becoming common less 100 years ago.. agree issues listed, feels like article overdramatizes situation especially comparing Venezuela. public shout sing theaters, limits lot contaminations. Reporting shithole middle nowhere—yup. Oregoner 

**doubt** Many poor people, relatively poor people, i.e., without several months savings, facing looming threat unemployment running without renewal arrears rental debt obligations coming due. Additionally another constitutional crisis happening November approaching country likely face severely polarized, inevitably chaotic time. point, federal response COVID something forget about, maybe donald allow state bailouts blue states, maybe not. it’ll go courts takes time, happen delay normal poor people getting screwed.

The markets represent minority population, population economy whole. Rises due perceived future buying opportunities now, perceived future value firms aside number tech industry they’re geographically locked.

In short, I’d love share optimism, however life finance medicine lead believe overwise. Yeah get like 118 sadly would also kill people miss March. I’d leave work 10:30PM neighbors would shitfaced respective balconies start cheering. Sometimes they’d hold puppy angry cat, Lion King style. Everyone optimistic things would get better part. everyone angry shit talk dickheads complex across street keep bbqs parties. look nice? really need fucking haircut? rest us cool looking like do. Bad hair means minimal exposure. scary shit! bro pilot family sure hell want get virus! Maybe so, thus far sub has, imo, come like boy cried wolf Lol no. probably point, sure. ain’t acting judge. lol native Australian animals seem struggling, kangaroos almost plague proportions. think testing we'd ok virus reduced numbers bit thought California ahead curve well containing pandemic? happened? I'm glad I'm US citizen right now. used dream us live ""American life"". guys European taking pandemic lightly beyond me. least Europeans getting shits together even though late. I'm ASEAN region able control pandemic, except Indonesia. 

Most friends families used look westerners, starting fade saw news guys. realise westerners ignorant dumb too. I'm sorry guys hard pill swallow.   Work home. rich man's world Honestly, really excellent run down. needs law passed allow companies control testing remain open.

They lose indemnity. There's smart way done telling employees get tested crime. Thanks Plunge Protection Team.. gotta love government interference markets! Even disagree politically admit saved traditionally conservative state ending like NY CA. She’s absolute best wouldn’t want anyone else charge moment director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases who's longer I've alive listen to. Dallas, Memphis, Tel Aviv, could go on, manor 90s last week. it’s spreading, whether comfort important? That’s choice. pretty much ID2020 is? Even microchip, substance (a dye?) injected you

What actual fuck talking about? ( ) says absolutely nothing ""dye injected you"". Seriously, actual fucking fuck talking about? 2 weeks ago maybe 10% people wearing masks. Almost everyone mask mandatory cities state. friend. state needs enforce masks public punitively.    
Escalating fines repeat offenders.     
It’s way. get it, florida stupid ? link lists components make index

 several states it’s actually illegal wear masks. Mask let them. Party house. Huge back yard, big BBQ pool. BYOB. death ICU numbers remain low even care infection numbers high?

Doesn’t mean mostly asymptomatic mild infections won’t matter? I’m sure repost. I’ve seen something similar posted 4 times last week. OC guys?

/s Yup. (Portland) barely opened outdoor bars gonna ugly. It’s dungeon ""something"" called funding education. proactive really government's strong suit, however. things need pre-approved spending plans plans action, people charge purse strings like uncertainty trying something done delt before.

Worked government role ten years. Proactive how-to book, except something gone wrong. always 'Why plan place this?' I've keep mine box reusing ones March gives idea bad things are. We're getting bad fitting masks seal expired ones brittle straps snap put on. Coming back June, mean, US really ranked first

I mean, look list! rank like rank confirmed cases! maybe unpreparedness rank, coincidence! whites only? past time angry. Get masks let idiots die out. Last week 4 days MSDH reported data, blaming software issues. reported back data one day, 1600 cases. data reporting delays I'm aware of. Unfortunately pointy masks cover letters. Comes back?? go?? We're 200k dead end July.. going rapidly. We. Are. Fucked. correct answer. Maybe governments do, maybe - determined court. But, one thing absolute - private businesses absolutely mandate property, police enforce requirement trespass violations. think customers right sue get sick going gyms - he's telling safe.  Dude

That's inappropriate.

...

...

It's spelled ""thicc""  governor. great joke is, unfortunately foundations ‘if stop testing we’ll stop cases’.

sigh.

our reality literally joke. February* yes agree.  really false sense security others wearing mask. 
I get US people think need go protest wave guns SIMPLE MEASURE could save lives. get it. Omg I'm sorry guys. Question : Oral test??? get PCR? love lady. disappointed won’t president.

""cases up, hospitals looking good.. something change?"".. response ""wait week two.."" hospitalizations skyrocketing.. what's next? know... They're stupid. They're smart. competing incentives, they're you. No. fuck? Went website Wednesday, tested Friday (10 minute wait). Got results Sunday morning.

Please explain cost distribution poorer countries falls upon people broke, debt, 20 30 million people losing jobs? Yes - should’ve listened scientists begin with! Remember, distribution vaccine going take while. Testing efficacy vaccine wild going take while. Better plan Easter 2023 cautious. California requiring masks weeks highest daily increase cases deaths yet. safe wearing mask surrounded people wearing masks.

Minimize contact really want minimize risk. she’s casually walking neighborhood kid

The risk related really depends neighborhood. every day almost never see anyone. neighborhood packed sidewalks obviously risky, 5 second encounter 10 ft seems like highly unlikely vector me. crowd crying ""muh freedom"" told wear mask, funny that. It’s like DUI example: could tell people don’t drink drive could kill someone. (sadly) doesn’t really work. say, “hey, could pay $15 Uber instead $15,000 on. DUI” guess works? Yep. Every single time. Personally, don’t care works get people drive drunk, long don’t it. Here, cares tell non-maskers, long it. It’s good you’re own. disconnecting politics it? I’m conservative won’t go around people without good mask. I’m happier staying home

If applied stereotypes way would called racist Yeah, I'm sending kids back school. We're virtual classes. Unfortunately cloth masks masks prevent infected. real pandemic would kill indiscriminately, large number die next 5 years regardless COVID.

Sarcasm not. I'm beginning seriously consider tell every US American come across move. :( Ontario Canada Country many mayors enforcing supported Premier Province . Province doesnt judicial mandate said support every mayor jurisdiction need best ensure safety reopening . Premier also said Covid numbers go put Province back Stage 1 breakouts occur regionally put regions stage 1. prudent every region enforce masks public places . .
One Ontarios worst regions Windsor 2 minutes Detroit .
Lots cross border workers farming communities hit region workers living farms getting sick even though Province paying million per farm build adequate living spaces worker.

Testing mandatory farmers fear one worker tests positive entire workforce shutdown lose season..

The Province working hard Farmers keep viable getting tests done .

Ontario lower 200 pos day 300. spikes Windsor also 18 people attending one nail salon community north Toronto. 

They diligent cautious .

Less 200 day awesome.. getting 18 people almost day from.one source scary fast easy travels 

Be careful mask...wash hands .. sure that. death immediate area due covid belongs family still believes hoax share parking lot construction company, we'd block way come go lot, otherwise bet we'd outside. realize also serious questions use PCRs testing AIDs? stopped gas station coffee. three customers, two employees cop (also getting coffee). three customers mask on. One employee around neck, one one all, cop one all. authorities useless.   gonna do? Quit patients pandemic? 

It's game chicken one caring saving lives loses. Agreed!  nah, think right idea. Tossing totality US one bag pretty excessive, really would impossible implement; simply way guarantee Mainer question gone Texas bit got sneezed on. 


Similarly, US banned Schengen back March, even though places like Estonia literally 0 cases. reason - way guarantee anything. Hey too. Hillsborough behind Miami area, although Orlando surging worse us almost caught up. work health care I'm burned out, so...disappointed people. Masks finally required struggle last 3 months. 

Also someone job tested positive weekend (at another one clinics Pasco) even though he's quarantined business usual rest clinic. I'm horrified. One friends works last night they've suggested get tested anything. what's happening around country we're even screwed think are. I’m ignoring question it’s relevant.

The topic reopening bars. argument keeping closed patrons aren’t responsible social distancing wearing masks.

Yes, I’m sure cases spiking states, part, due protests, reasoning keeping bars closed isn’t “cases spiking it’s safe right now”. It’s literally, I’ve pointed want ignore, “people bars weren’t responsible, keep closed”.

and idea protest “hundreds thousands people black trans rally”.

You call denying science, could actually focus subject instead narrative you’re pushing. Pure politics, unconstitutional knows it.

The Constitution includes contracts clause - government can't interfere private contracts, takings clause - government takes money goods value something pay it.

This violates them. knows - short, serious totally is... US well Germany, still something like 30,000 deaths. Yeah agree labelled Hillary Massacre chant lock year long. defense though, reason recently sustained stunning blow head. Looking get shape? Want work out? Afraid it'll easy trainer go easy you?

Call u/Pit_of_Death Personal Training Today get asking for! trust scientists aren’t politically shackled asleep wheel. Scientists didn’t spend first critical months telling public wear masks fumbling testing ignoring tracing outbreak clusters. live east coast north West Palm. work Target lot older folks come cell phone help. wearing masks interacting techs closely long periods time.
Also friend staying older community said walking dog noticed neighbors talking closely wearing masks dying surely lot dramatic, country young compromised people much better. Especially historic good economy carry through. It’s price gouging . Walk supermarket Costco / BJ’s prices every food item also .

They aren’t gouging costs sky rocketed, shipping costs sky rocketed also slower that, even. take two weeks death ""certified"" covid-19 death. complicated reporting positive test case.  learn geography? Dont give donny ideas, already wants shoot protestors Turns Earth plans handling climate change along! literally want spread pandemic November. That’s entire plan. Get governors play ball also danger losing, suspend elections pandemic over. don’t declare it’s over, ever, long there’s one case left. MIQE guidelines developed aegis of Stephen A. Bustin, Professor Molecular Medicine, world-renowned expert quantitative PCR author book A-Z Quantitative PCR which called “the bible qPCR.”

You're lab rat. He's expert. I'd take word yours.

In recent podcast interview Bustin points that “the use arbitrary Cq cut-offs ideal, may either low (eliminating valid results) high (increasing false “positive” results).”


And, according him, Cq 20 30 aimed at, concern regarding reliability results Cq 35.

If Cq value gets high, becomes difficult distinguish real signal background, example due reactions primers fluorescent probes, hence higher probability false positives. Lol get voted certain people can't stand hear truth major cities shambles.

Close beaches defund police support protests pandemic. Thank God priorities order.

It's amazing small group people (Twitter bubble media) influence decisions country. never said effect linear say panacea. 

i've heard argument several times now, source disproves you. studies could cited (such chinese study linked article sent) would better support argument.

yes sucks going charge 3,000, yes sucks government buy anyone needs it, yes sucks working better, using value life calculator want price within realm fair. 

the confidence study better most. studies come prove disprove one, one seems worthwhile option. one comes that's better we'll start seeing studies. Username checks damn shame actually need example.
Just wear mask.Wearing masks make u less alpha. two thirds plan to? Damn lot dumb parents state. 3 daughters??? 😓 Correction: ""Americans stupider anyone world anticipated "" make 7-day rolling average valid past week without complete data?

Yes, several friends give shit selfish don’t care, fully believe virus still go party planning vacations. finally lost shit one day feel better try antagonize weekly now. Good fucking riddance. friends mine acting way questionable friends before, I’m done putting now. report spam misinformation? article like help?



It's neither. **Important change way numbers published**

&amp;nbsp; 

For whoever interested, July 1st RIVM publishing new data daily anymore. start publishing data weekly, every Tuesday around 14:00. [Source guess massive protest LA nothing it. Imbeciles. see graphs new positive tests (1st graph), hospitalizations (2nd graph), deaths (3rd graph) deaths sex age (4th graph).

&amp;nbsp;

For first three graphs deselect 'tot en met gisteren' see new data person tested positive/ hospitalized/ died.

&amp;nbsp;

As today 54 (+0) (updated 30-06 13:59) patients ICU. patients confirmed suspected Covid-19. total 2928 Covid-19 patients ICU since pandemic began. [Source lastly, Covid-19 dashboard published state collects important data one place. [find  Sadly I'm America. borders closed returning New Zealanders - quarantined 14 days. Aside that, aren’t restrictions New Zealanders. known cases managed quarantine. detectable community transmission masks required. protests societal change people murdered beaches leisure activity. sure that’s hard grasp. Good thing live America. longer support safe here.

Yes, sarcasm. keep avoiding question. I’ll ask one time you’re written science denier.

So spikes caused bars like 50 people not, example, hundred thousand people cramming Brooklyn park black trans rally, you’re saying?

Because there’s article front leave rally significantly criticism bar 50 people, that’s you’re say.

I want crystal clear record. Still first spike. brexit this? guess like economy. You’ll happy taxes skyrocket. got voted oblivion pointing many reasons people scoff experts. messaging disaster beginning. Fauci straight lied masks start ""GG"" ? US Govt- Hey everyone, wear mask months around people, could save thousands lives allow us get economy back normal sooner.

Stupid assholes--You can't tell do! Hilarious? think incredibly depressing better description would feel. know joking but, seriously going enforce something like this? I'm guessing considerate mask-wearing folks smart enough eat restaurants pandemic. can't even imagine dining somewhere indoors, I'd stressed whole time. Across bay Tampa (Hillsborough County) can't even schedule test ""all appointments full time"". theory get tested weeks outpatient procedure scheduled late July. rate I'm expecting procedure pushed back. Again. think mainly individualist culture. Many people concerned anything greater good, also get attitude ""nobody tells do"". Plus poor leadership national level states left figure own. know. I'm sorry. That's unfair. Haha even close sure accidental injury coverage, would anyone expect pay COVID? news? missing something? forget Rogan also skinhead. multiple White Power tattoos. Ok, here's something rigourous. 

If compare France USA there's difference %. Hardly defining feature pandemic response.

My point flare ups EU-wide. Germany France hundreds new cases daily, reopening economies encouraging cross-border population movement. expect end result be?  Fuck Brix not, almost ONE wearing mask outside major cities Florida. People sent 20 screenshots comment since morning, what's like famous :D

Only came here, could tell sure joking :) THANK YOU! great Twitter account follow. Really appreciate this. like hitler automods It’s like American economy restaurant there’s burning fire corner it. Firefighters asked keep coming contain it, percentage dying. tried closing restaurant bit people like, sorry, can’t keep closed forever. Yes, patrons keep burning flames it’s mostly old people. We’ll keep sending firefighters. Also, don’t tell anything young people don’t die showing worrying effects smoke inhalation. fine. course. I'm trying spread anything way enforce this

A cop sees car TN license plate? He's authorized shoot first think questions later. often enough BAM!, Tennessee Lives Matter think going New Jersey. 

Not think reason go New Jersey first place, matter? spikes likely high time around. two reasons, first learned better treatment regime (basically, use ventilators *really* to, use immunosuppressants), second population taking *some* precautions peak high maybe spread out.

However probably buckle up, try get people take seriously (full lockdown necessary IMO something middle, many people working home possible) arrange states take excess patients. went wrong opened cases low enough contact tracing cut chains transmission. Bad bot... got one worst auto-moderators reddit history. hard breathe! say, risk catching respiratory disease makes impossible breathe. admit, though, getting lax time away work.

And know ""Maaam, please close windows"" joke lady gets closes windows? yea. happened me. Since everyone believes money. 

I care die care costs money... answer question. People saying ""just wait two weeks!"" months now, new daily deaths US continue drop. I'm open evidence saying ""it's obvious"" answer. plenty doctors telling studies showed non fitted, non specialized masks security theater. still say that. others say “or could reduce transmission substantially, knows.” You’re wrong. 

In opinion massive miscalculation it’s part problem now. 

But, eventually reverse course correct error. There’s reason wear mask today, even direction past wasn’t ideal. 

People need let go past criticisms start trying right thing, sake tomorrow.  happens appoint friends, buddies donors positions power instead hiring putting place scientists doctors govern advise public science medical related topics. customer always right? 

No, he/she's usually inconsiderate idiot put corporate cowardice. wear mask properly? Apparently kidding. could saved thousands lives reopen everyone would worn masks! That's pathetic United States response been. say ""rebels"", everyone else says ""retards"". Cheap solutions expensive problems always take longest decide recent spikes, people catching virus? recently opened bars restaurants? I’ve read it’s also parties home families friends throwing. think referring Pandemic Response Team largely disband Trump Administration, [disease surveillance management CDC. 

Their tasks include spotting potential emerging new diseases, existing ones infectious diseases outbreaks. isn’t exactly new information. Lol! get fucked going church, yeah fucked head.

Therapy everyone, way. especially seem need it. People like mental health stigma. watched video doctors switching ventilator tubes someone old one huge chunks lung it... 

Don’t fuck around wear mask best avoid it. things stay least next year, even many survivors dealing side affects. thing many nasty surprises bundled in... Majority people wearing masks personal experience 50+. I’m saying isn’t accurate way, feels like selective enforcement tool suppression justified protests. send people college. teach people K-12 critical media studies. dangerously, *after* college educate people all.

What truly drastically ill-informed parti$an population dupes opportunists. Kind lot terms masks effectiveness? Lol read see recommends people always consult local authorities recommended practices widespread community transmission, especially settings physical distancing cannot maintained, governments encourage general public wear a fabric mask. WHO also provides details composition fabric mask safely wear one.

  Glad see someone else saying this. lowest paid workers expected jobs already hate pay. country broken /u/yodarded, solid data has! :-D (it six days stale... caught ""download day"", lol)

I want note ""how active cases reported"" seems vary greatly state. every state studious reducing it. New York particular: list 300,000 active cases. that's every case like April 15th present. Michgan hand cleans quick. think let ""roll off"" time automatically. California's active cases look like ""high side"" need ""rolled off"". Arizona might tad high. 3 look accurate me. 

Active cases doubling every 15 days Texas, 17 days Arizona, 23 days Florida, 31 days Calfornia. Michigan cases appear be... halving every 63 days? right on. Texas Arizona much worse.

Since much spread happens superspreading events presence absence difference state hit hard state isn’t. Whether infected person happens show mass gathering without mask partly dependent amount spread mask policies, also depends luck.

That said, reopening populous state ongoing transmission leading new cases surprising unlucky all. Especially people kind attitude here. frustrating seeing tired caring virus everyone is. either think they’ll get fine, already could get tested, figure they’ll inevitably get point future now. People wear masks stores, sure, also cross county lines get nails done throw house parties constantly. Well, I've school since March 13, I'm hopeful get lunch fall ask him. Lots folks would think kissing booth safe right now, “because outside”. nothing mentality. 

Also, don’t want look “stupid” “irrational” wearing mask crossing street, “because everyone knows cant get outside”. 

Good tho. Maybe example inspire someone tighten up. completely ignore catch-22 scenario lol idiots gonna idiot, peaceful protestors already know that, choice fight actual legislation change starts social pressure. 

Remember, peaceful protests, idiots fighting salons open...the stay-at-home orders would never worked America cause stupid people. 

What say right theory holds bearing idiots. I'm canada, free healthcare. Ventilator free, masks not. I'm broke cant afford masks said (and I'm short time rn go find it) masks recommended general population shortages evidence cloth mask decreased risk getting infected evidence may increase chances infection given way touch face more, use improperly (below nose!), experience false sense security. 

The tune masks US changed way back early March, recall correctly. Federal campaign promote mask use can't tell you, think health officials held back. 

In case, town high mask adoption months now. got message time. Makes slightly easier lol, figure helps, maybe use inoculate people buy time vaccine three trustworthy sources. Consistently point ahead game Put national news. Even lot anti-maskers love dogs would take seriously saw happening pets whose owners died. arguing someone lockdown skepticism sub. lost cause. conspiracy evil comforting thought ""Shit happens."" idea random things happen terrifies people. sad that? soon saw headline thought ""public opinion masks bought change"" watch tomorrow people call masks muzzles saying they've wearing months now.

They fucking been. troll us. foreign interference conspiracy theorist laugh ""sheep,"" feel superior. helps fill emptiness minutes. sick tired everyone internet fucking righteous. sorry humans social animals, anti-social. 

While understand frustration rising infection rates, attacking search mental support within community something positive human development. Please remember everyone fucked head needing therapy, people take preventive measures use church end isolated go crazy thinking going outside solution.

Nowhere even close normal. *HAMBERDERS*  Sounds great then. I'll bow - right wrong - got credentials.  Fuck, Americans retarded  already cities capacity across country.. even Houston.

When exceed capacity death rates soar. death rate skyrocket weeks. New York City style catastrophe, likely even worse, dozens cities. 

Get ready, end summer fall going total shit show. virus apparently mutated areas around world. hooks grew stronger contagious. People everywhere like ""well may mutate become less deadly!""

Equally probable may mutate become even It’s better whatever shit hole decided crawl Let's make one thing clear. economy well means citizens going hardship. wear [reusable 8 hours day protect all, part protect workers keeping economy running. Protect us workers actively participating keeping businesses open food table. money. keeping vulnerable subsets economic class dangerous financial ruin, eviction, hardship. I'm still shocked major company jumped making tons designer, logo, comedic etc masks.

They place read exact data article op above. referenced 2015-2020 flu/pneumonia cases idea talking dude.  70 percent people surveyed district want open schools without masks. need start broadcasting national television someone getting intubated. I’m sure would plenty volunteers willing waive HIPAA national tv naysayers get glimpse realities end ventilators.

I know fear isn’t best way get people understand accountable point tried everything else there’s still people don’t get it. look votes pushing agenda effective churches, let's hope effective everybody. really think 4th July coming people fighting avoid kind restrictions day perhaps dominoes start fall back safety way enforce this. simply asking travelers self quarantine, going work imo. states left people self regulate act responsibly, kind relate people using turn signals. something simple easy better everyone around yet people refuse use fucking turn signals. thing masks going thing asking people self quarantine. I'll go SCIENTISTS one, thank you. aren’t ventilators killing people tho?

that’s i’ve read, wear masks lol Dude talking disease killing amount americans 9/11 every three days so. many deaths idiots like need see take seriously?? 1. young people getting infected smaller portion expected die. may true much longer - recent data Florida shows getting older population ( )
2. Greatly increased testing capturing large number milder/asymptomatic cases went un-confirmed previously, portion sick people among new cases currently smaller.

3. Better treatment - report UK said probability death 1/4th April hospitalized patients, probably due better ventilation management, anti-coagulation anti-inflammation treatments.

Deaths probably go current spread continues (it's testing leading cases, percentage tests coming back positive increasing well, spreading faster), time time get spread control things reach New York levels crisis. Unfortunately, think time now, many states squandering it. Funding obviously issue.

The system I'm used staggered drop offs. buses/drivers used, levels separate. makes bus driver 5-6 hour day job. think common system. get worst Californians. That’s thing. Like shitty lottery They're definitely hit wall though. number covid hospitalizations continue rising exponentially, they're distributing patients evenly hospitals come single moment there's bed available state. sub swear - there’s MULTIPLE studies posted r/COVID19 

Sometimes it’s okay hope. promise.  see you’ll part “I’ll die Covid give ham” club. That’s still kinda long, isn’t it? definitely significantly better without sunlight ""Responsible""?

That may little harsh tone...

How could differentiate way child contracts viruses passes parent... Shocked sub didnt downvote ban article. Wouldn’t mandatory quarantine 2 weeks school (or even first weeks school. one cares syllabus week) eliminate almost cases? International students online classes semester, especially situation home country undoubtedly better US rn. 
I really believe schools could least require enforce masks campus. would severely minimize spread, eradicate completely. spreads campus party, masks help immensely aftermath. think students wanting get education see friends capacity likely comply wear mask 40 year old adults place masks law. 
My school getting rid fall break us finals online thanksgiving break. biggest travel opportunities. I've seen inflammatory disease cause kidney issues, pancreatic issues, heart issues, etc.

That mostly asymptomatic damage caused creates symptoms.

Children experiencing this. Adults harder detect. many lies. get paid lie saying watched video new federal guidelines calling headache covid. testing required.

This false. federal symptoms look updated. There's almost thing presumptive positive case anymore US testing widely available. cannot headache diagnosed COVID-19 presumptively. tested. hospitals get thousands dollars reporting case.

No. RIP long term damages infecting people? going back school aid spread virus, even children aren’t risk death. No, there's going layer covid mask, likely covid elsewhere too. think every surface clean except mask, suddenly breeding ground bacteria?

Point is, youre concerned touch transmission, already assume there's covid public surfaces. matter touch mask touch doorknob. doorknob probably already covered germs non-maskers, people sanitize hands, people coughing place.

Investor consumer confidence really low places keep getting locked whenever cluster detected, can't keep economy running like that. Pretty much. Seems incredibly common opinion now: ""If old vulnerable stay home, rest us get life catch catch it."" answers happens sick/vulnerable/old people work pay rent get health insurance. guess I'm 40 year old chronic health condition, either risk catching give job, default mortgage, longer health insurance manage chronic condition.

I'm shocked took week. WA, last week. whole west coast due, see Cascadia subduction zone seen way Trump hugs American flag? undoubtedly man would never lie American people. perception, tip toed around Chinese political machine, cautious making formal recommendations restrictions border closures.

This area clear really aware public health research time. reason recommend travel restrictions evidence demonstrated travel restrictions meaningful effect stopping pandemic spread. 

Since 2009, declared six Public Health Emergencies International Concern (2009 swine flu, 2014 polio, 2014 Ebola, 2016 Zika, 2018–20 Kivu Ebola 2019–20 COVID-19), specifically advised implementing travel trade bans containment measure.

2009: Travel bans work. travel imposing travel restrictions would little effect stopping virus spreading

2010: Travel bans work. following measures advised, proven ineffective, costly counter-productive: ... restrictions travel trade

2014: Travel bans work. bans detrimental ineffective.

2020: Travel bans work. consistent recommendations.

Travel bans delay initial outbreak, neither overall number cases peak number hospitalizations actually decreased. Furthermore, border restrictions extremely effective (99% more) win 2-3 weeks time — restrictions are, let's say, 80% effective, pretty much anything all.

We find border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions unlikely delay spread 2–3 weeks unless 99% restrictions would make extremely limited contribution policy rapid containment influenza source first emergence pandemic seems obvious travel bans would slow spread virus, reality, happen.

South Korea Hong Kong shut travel mainland China still managed fine, US Europe shut borders, help slightest. single country world prevented virus entering borders travel Sure, raised alert level, overly publicize it.

This patently false. released news briefings multiple times per week declaration PHEIC. find here: know labeled COVID pandemic earlier would kicked lot people gear, leaving labeled [Chinese] epidemic. 

No, I'm sorry way knowing this. think case, cannot say ""DO know"" would true. many times country's federal leadership downplay virus well March 11th use term pandemic? many countries still downplaying severity? convey feelings leaving labeled epidemic long made lot people feel safe...right Italy 30,000 cases thousand deaths...

When Tedros used word pandemic, March 11th, Italy 12,469 cases. One week earlier, March 4th, 3,092. One week earlier, Feb 26 470. Again, using hindsight (with fundamental errors well) make judgement that, frankly, informed enough reasonably make. Yeah makes sense terms retrospective study. thinking someone would come widely-respected simulated study now, seen one. 

Re: asymptomatic, I've seen, lung damage turning up. seen much turn re: latent damage organs (usually damage kidney, liver, nervous system, etc turn result least noticeable symptoms). 

It'll probably time clear damage labs/imaging translates noticeable impairment. Theaters closed till 2025 safe! Although unknowns current virus, generally pretty good idea respond prevent viral spread. 

Seems there's pretty huge gap knowledge political fortitude implement it. People go ICU headaches loss smell dude. ICU sick people clearly virus, people tested severe illness. 

As far majority ICU taken non-COVID19 patients. shit. think hospitals virus came around? like ICUs sitting empty. Yes think saw Florida read it. I'm talking see, parents disagree masks still wear them. Everyone work 95% 30+ refuses bitches day. \*fewer

Fewer countable, less not. 

In general, plural, use fewer. (Fewer trees, sheep, goats, people, etc.) isn't, use less. (Less love, money, congestion.) seems plausible, would need ""coronavirus"" cold, widespread. remember 2-3 colds years ago experienced mild symptoms described virus, particular loss taste smell several weeks, bad breath couple weeks recovered. wonder coronavirus cold. case, common sense would assume get recently immune, get immunity common cold. order halt poverty crime statistics well logic..zero crime zero poverty!! realize median cost bringing drug market $900 million.

Yeah, that's drug goes several clinical trials FDA approval. Remdesivir going fast $3000 lot money, look drugs cost, hardly outrageous.

Those ""other drugs"" target market maybe 10 million users. one could hundreds millions. outrageous. Umm due industrial farming? feel like point, basically everything symptom. guess limited liability, bureaucracy, contractual obligations.

On #3, could suppliers contract wherein hospital employees must use specific brand + bid contract hospital can't shop around better pricing.

Think like Hollywood accounting, too.

You buy 500ct ibuprofen CVS like $15.

An ibuprofen hospital billed $50 per pill. recently. recent part rest New England, New York, New Jersey exempt. dems stopped testing would 0 cases day /s know better treat it, sure makes big impact past weeks compared start now, better understanding prevent deaths it.

What long term damage getting yet seen Hey someone help here.... 


The study says ... 


""About 1/3 pregnant women infected COVID, hospitalized vs 5.8% infected non-pregnant peers. **BUT researchers unable distinguish hospitalization Coronavirus-related symptoms vs. pregnancy-related procedures DELIVERY.""** 


So counting pregnant woman going delivery hospitalization study? CAN""T right, I'm trouble finding I'm seeing false. I'll taking personal apologies people got mad saying anti-shutdown protests appeal small business owners putting short term material interests human life lol college social science class (I dont even remember one lol , sociology maybe anthropology?) one thing instructors us go outside observe car make observations/assumptions whose car was. 

Long story short professors. disabled tags. MS one could simply observe looking given moment wasnt symptoms.

You never know looking someone. Air travel already know coming from. easy, either test arrival quarantine. Checkpoints freeways, national guard checks gets driving where. give address check actually roaming around. 
See state plate , knock door. 

Self proclaimed greatest country earth richest country planet can’t ? Resources lacking here. 

There much freedom movement country combat pandemic. 
US citizens proved don’t make good choices, need force it. 

I guess rest world quarantining USA, eventually long painful deadly pandemic drag forever virus go away. 

They us. stupid own. Ty! Yeah jaw almost visibly dropped today...I literally awe good way. Sincerely hope big outbreaks here. even talking about? straight lunatic. 

""You said that, me"" argument especially bring two topic movements right after. anecdotal opinions lead unfounded conspiracy theories. Maybe instead homeopathic solutions, try educating yourself. Trying take moral high ground backhanded putdowns make rational, ignorant. totally entitled that.

And I'm glad people feel really comfortable assuming risks.

We need people line vaccine.

I'm position assume risks.

And hope Fauci gets vaccine publicly. got back grocery store (Meijer) saw 10 people masks... fucking insane. Everyone thinks blew right over... 

Spoiler. not. listened nurses talk this? Yes, they're used people dying they're also used mostly older sicker people dying. They're used able treat people. They're used dying people families say goodbye help them. They're used coworkers around support companionship instead alone one room couple sedated people day long. They're also used going home families worrying bringing home invisible death. 

This different. Show compassion. Healthcare workers people like everyone else. Keep wearing cloth face masks then. won’t be. Red areas less compliant things like mask orders also tend spread suburbs rural. Denser cities tend blue impacted more. ""3.6 roentgen, great, terrible"" ***entire*** headline? time shit.

I read first words that's it. Oh okay. non-sense let anyone leave NJ, I'm following correctly, cases control, Texas doesn't, think also non-sense ask people arriving Texas quarantine? Maybe let leave state all, like suggesting done NJ/NY? simply can't learn mistakes made past, something... Everybody New Zealand doesn’t seem happy dreaming “mess”. 


http://www.covidplanb.co.nz/ What’s funny lectured someone mean, took personal shot me.  move die, difference us. sad part is, dumb people would get sick dumb people spreading others. *Could*? already has? lot though local requirements regular sterilization, lot world drug supply comes India, Mexico. They're better sterilization, willing accept lower standard.

In India production lines almost constant production something tests contamination. contamination testing happens Germany too, production still stops regularly sterilization even contamination find.

It makes big difference production rate end costs. responded factual data.

You tell fuck off.

Guess sounds believable? study claimed poor effectiveness cloth surgical masks back April, retracted due poor methodology. sure read notice retraction linked top. another study pre-COVID found cloth masks less effective medical masks still afforded protection. authors wrote follow-up wake COVID, linked page. also targeted hospital environment, general public outdoors, contagions tend less concentrated. essence, wear best mask able to. bandana effectiveness effective ready-made, better-fitting multi-layer cloth mask, effective cloth mask built filtration layer, effective surgical mask, effective fitted N95 mask.

Additionally, people wear face covering sort, less free-floating virus particles air, less effective masks become effective result. Filopodia. Many viruses cause them, means infecting neighboring cells, rather simply exploding cell open. Greetings Georgia also opened way soon! Yeah, wont dispute all. absolutely shameful. images various wood-chippers.

I imagine, actually read article either. heavy fines wearing mask healthcare setting without permission healthcare professional. doctors able hand simply giving names list cops end shift. That's fine people going take pay? GM absorb did? had. still have. want mandate masks everyone go back work explode economy. Im ok this, wish done 3 months ago. Scientists need listen economists goes vice versa. Ignorance cured educating. Even stubborn conned becoming informed. problem politics (gasp!) rickety system people still think best world. Problem starts top rot goes deep foundations. It’s particularly terrifying Canadians. 

We horrified Americans facing, feel deeply. please don’t come visit us well truly over. woke, I'm jealous! get medical advice investment banks. It’s refreshing feel confident elected executive branch. catching heat changing report ICU beds capacity legit reason.

Its obviously good thing cancer hospital taking covid patients times tough. also perfectly reasonable take second look number CEO's vest interest running hospitals normal profitable levels.

Tue 6/9 - 4.6%

That look like moving right direction me. failure leadership isnt Trump

When comes Covid, though. Yes individual states responsible taking measures curtail pandemic, strong central leader pushing effective measures would made difference, also GOP governors would fallen line behind Trump (as largely now, causing half-assed measures implanted).

The Trump plague him, *especially* current surge cases. said comment below, don’t necessarily need new medicine. discover pre-existing medication (like dexamethasone) improves survival decreases severity, may enough. Fauci optimistic vaccine 2021, too. At-risk people like healthcare workers elderly could vaccinated overall disease burden virus would shrink manageable amount. 1 lakh = 100,000 10⁵. look up. get people in/out China, world okay. can’t imagine process washing dog would good way transfer virus. OK, get saying. Pretty much nothing 100% safe, certainly getting takeout optional vast majority people. really optional everyone though, say health care workers working crazy shifts, truckers, people otherwise travel. 

It's crap sandwich sure, allowing limited risk allow people able make living complex calculus. absolutes little discussion. Protocols dealing severe form disease improved greatly, well effects, example, potential clotting issues people get severe form disease. learn listening first 20-30 minutes podcast below. Dr. Daniel Griffin clinician dealing covid-19 patients since March. details lot happened podcast terms improvement dealing Bullfuckingshit. bar thats closed since march 13th.

I cause this. yeah could lose everything I've worked since 20 years old. 5 week old baby. fucking sub... like 12 year olds never work shit lives telling people like something wrong going literally go bankrupt. Cool. Thanks letting know ilk fucked up. Fuck place. $54 billion state deficit record unemployment that. currently tied last couple week deaths, Texas slightly ahead. Deaths still decreasing NY, Texas holding steady.

What matters **is** trend, shit happened 3 months ago.

Also learn population density. It'll make sound like know talking about. totally agree. good ole boy system extremely strong area. I'm actually shocked get away regularly. I've lived areas corruption local politics unabashedly blatant here. there’s data support position, it’s time re-examine position. suppose think antivaxxers idiots, you’re acting exactly like one. 

There’s data support position, you’re digging anyway it’s easier believe conspiracy *feelings* might wrong. Thanks vaccines go ton safety trials. mean something passed Phase Two pass Phase Three. something passes Phase Three safe populations. 

The Oxford vaccine rests hat vaccine never successfully released never successfully finished trials.

That's say work. totally might. may safest little vaccine ever vaccinate.

I'm saying cannot know stage may know years.

My favorite vaccine story either Yellow Fever Vaccine MMR vaccine. remarkably safe life saving people. eggs allergy might potentially dangerous allergic reaction Yellow Fever vaccine even egg based vaccines cause reaction. MMR vaccine, poorly understood ways, cause fever seizures handful people.

We absolutely still vaccinate. also actively looking ways make vaccine safer people better understand risks negative outcomes.

And cannot one signs human test subject. appreciate do. uncertainty, scientists follow call precautionary principle (see eg Wikipedia). means assume worst case one happening prepare one. point many died. American people responsibility vote elect people charge. Every election counts ones want vote in...that complacency accepting status quo instead speaking continuing speak out. 

The politicians American people figured out. raise hell couple days act like care week waiting something else gets attention. Then, issue come many times stop caring accept going be.

I see again. 

So, yes, American people themselves. that's story America. reached bipolar benchmark years ago. 50 years income stagnation. Koch brothers setting puppet tea party movement divert attention. folks thought voice. background, siesmic roar pitched frequency many could hear spoon fed Fox News; Citizens United passed Supreme Court new found Tea Party folks indoctrinated misinformation seen since Nazi Germany.

Super Pacs inundated marginalized working poor scripts immeneint decline western civilization. targeted transgendered bathrooms looted federal reserve. past used Colin Powell use 9/11 start war oil.

Meanwhile, half country one catastrophic financial episode bankruptcy. College tuition spiraled control graduates pallid job market awaiting them.

How match previous studies showing surfaces long 3 days (depending material)? Oh. Yea Yeah, I’m Dutch whilst don’t masks required outside public transportation, weren’t allowed hang others, 400€ fines caught 3 car, essentially criminal citation, shit helped lot. I'm live cote st luc almost nobody wears masks outdoors they're mandatory indoors. understand point, experience saying primary argument. argument takes backseat arguments hoax, blown, cold, masks work.

Don't put time limit it.

Do *recommend*, REQUIRE, masks public.

Educate public (especially listening exclusively WH Fox News) impacts. Make bipartisan, non-political issue. fucking is.

And goddamn it, stop traveling! Didnt trump talk deploying army etc vaccine population soon possible? I’m kind confused you’re supposed wear mask dining restaurant though? you’re waiting food ordering suppose? order drinks beginning doesn’t leave much time, unless you’re pulling every sip, seems counterproductive... don’t really understand point there. I’m trying discredit anything, little confused. Dine-in isn’t open area yet, don’t see anyone patios wearing masks servers. nothing else trains comfortable. lots leg room storage. wish America would invest good rail infrastructure. I’d travel way design, nets supposed full holes? 3,900-6,000... 3 deaths 3,900 equal .08%
7 6,000 equal .11%. seems high. Didn’t CDC say death rate 50 .04%? 

Maybe saying big guys league might higher chance dying?? Idk  ""do right thing"", mean act intelligent responsibly own, yes, agree you. People grow brain act intelligently without things forced them. However, lot Americans even right thing told to, think expecting right thing wishful best. gonna happen, seen. Texas well past point NYC terms hospital capacity issued stay home order March. NYC max base ICU capacity first week April, 10 days locked down, hospitalizations peak 3 weeks lock down. Texas still open business, many regions maxing ICU base capacity right now. continue guy said, 'freedom' basically dogwhistle self-righteous, self-absorbed entitlement days states. pretty fucked. mostly ignorant, brain-washed folks seem use way... folks protest state capitol armed rifles, turn around criticize protestors largest civil rights movement history.

i mean, i'm free go jump bridge feel inclined. mean good idea aggressively confront folks trying stop lol. course! heard best treatment best people best industry best Country! Right, mostly smaller hospitals struggling remember correctly. hoping understand struggling didn’t cover going happen. problem ideological logical business oriented. we'd army contact tracers eddy mask making would new hot industry. test results take time. people wait results? test antibodies, tests fast. virus antibodies yet. type tests can't used prevention measure.

And countries struggle test citizens, let alone test every tourist lands airport. Nah, stop testing. numbers good numbers, best numbers! 
\s feel lucky? 1/3 way vaccine *which may never actually come fruition and/or effective beyond limited time frame*... never successful corona virus vaccine, troubling data showing rapid reduction antibodies time... People act like vaccine given, great big *IF*... lookup patents intravenous nanochips faith people pandemic. thought ""Eh, maybe i'm critical others... Maybe I'M smart think am. Maybe people, average, decent."" know stupid selfish average person is, least US, i'm appalled. think go lockdown people safe. government care us, I've isolation since March remain safe me.

I'm... astronomically high risk.

I appreciate dick it, though. ton people worst say nervous rushed vaccine. assume worst. Prove disease that's existed 9 months tops cause life long damage?

It might, that's far absolute fact. entire dutch population vaccinated matter weeks Explain bad everyone thinks might be. Nah, cool.
Let Trump cultists thing. Tough luck doctors nurses. Going pubs, beaches getting facial haircut essential fighting fluuuuu./s Saw 3 separate bread vendors local grocery store today pull masks TALK like 15 minutes filling bread rack. want scratch damn head. Well judging 2020 far, even news footage showing massive zombie horde consuming China, Trump would call ""another Dem' hoax"". Something therapist taught years ago visual chart draw anxiety. don’t know useful maybe could start main concern? map little contributions you’re anxious. 

Then underneath write combat anxieties. anxious getting infected? ways avoid that. 

If get infected, data friend. 

I’m gunna undermine state things right now, make sure anxieties emotional reaction match level danger presented! hope helps little.

The future always uncertain even normal times! You’re gonna get this. Yup. NBA isn’t restarting all, it? Italy fined people €200 (~$215) able drastically reduce Natural selection rather effective.  sounds like 5 years I'm fun making different masks wear, can't people creative get masks different logos whatever? trump masks even? sigh immediate family lives rural area they’re already concerned 10 covid patients local hospital know town isn’t equipped handle it, hardly anyone cares cases rising. idea someone knows better beyond anti mask people. egos shine ""no one tell do"" feel like smart ones because, according them, ""this bunch hysteria nonsense anyway"" wear mask. feel sorry if/when catch it. feel sorry people trying safe might catch them. ingenuity! Keep trolling, kiddo. don’t know anything Philly, may circumstances different.

In CA state mostly locked months, last week gyms bars retail started opening. measure control, mandatory masks, distancing etc. weren’t allowed congregate bar, seated somewhere could remove mask table.
Temperatures masks required entry.

Now seeing large spikes cases two weeks people mostly stopped taking streets mass. write contributing factor hallmark people wanting accept responsibility actions.

For months people shaming people going beach, even though people distancing outdoors, somehow people shoulder shoulder streets effect all. It’s completely hypocritical. bars haven’t open long enough cases come rules place mitigate large spread. read comment reddit day someone said ventilators actually killing people TOTALLY covid refused ventilator fine feel amazing. Sure Jan record breaking case increases Texas last week so, could seen coming? Sweden Finland actually around mortality rate countries, still large outbreaks compared total population. countries EU opened early, early April early May, severe impacts it. could've ended sentence third word still totally correct. It’s one thing paid athletes accept risk ... dudes getting education discount only. risk isn’t adding up. surging much live, people seem wearing masks keeping distance part. Small mostly upper middle class town central California. possible, we're work home trying mitigate exposure much possible. thing us really go daily run. Every days send one us grocery store rotating schedule never expose one person much. Never zero percent chance wouldnt get exposed though sooner later living heart city. person classes started yesterday college football heartland. We'll see lasts. Masks required riding transit. going shit show. fair. still think visually less alarming (and overall accurate) graph one CNN uses shows line break top screen. great, thanks sharing! Try reading commenting next time. might wrong imagine soon ally U.S got could replicate much faster FREEEEEEEEEEEDUMB!!! Lol reddit doctors epidemiologists ya mean? 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣 help flat lied months ago. idiots Facebook flooding comments proof masks work articles saying back March. could done national mask order bragged lives saved. 3-7 deaths? That's it? tell SEC, they'll start season right away! Go Tigauhsssss! Roll Twide!! lmao real? typical 1984 bullshit

next time come claim 2+2=5 think gyms first indoor spaces open safe pubs.
I don’t think gyms opening.
I don’t think pubs schools clothes shops opening.
I think opening schools important open pubs.
No contradiction ya dumb cunt. JFC people. cant nice things Look fucking nuance, Dan.  Elective surgeries suspended awhile, that’s profit center hospitals. Add higher PPE costs. Hospitals got big time bailout feds many wouldn’t enough offset. not. forgot mention masks harmful helpful. best outcome people wearing masks. no.

desensitized refers people exposed something, longer feeling it.

i saying never exposed reality didnt affect them. whether think hoax, dont follow social media or, otherwise ignorant, develop care. is, literally sensisitivity information ""desensitize"" Definitely kind thinking literally like virus. Think good education vaccine 90 percent success rate. good education get herd immunity people able critically think point people's dumb streams logic.

I gravitate towards conspiracy theories, try consider everything believe nothing cant prove. use antivax strictly antivax thought companies US gave sub par vaccines profit margins compared developed countries. even that's true certain diseases vaccines made one company multiple markets. checked, N95 masks Amazon ""KN95"" - different standard, still supposed filter 95%. IIRC, hospitals cannot use KN95 masks due liability issues. Duh. Lol countries dude

Hence many Americans cross southern northern border go buy medicine fraction cost exact thing Legit question - never see video footage inside hospitals overflowing? Riverside, specifically, least NY things bad there? I've watched news countries journalists inside outside showing bad things are, interviews front-line staff, long lines ambulances, corridors full sick people, body bags taken out, etc.

We see type coverage USA I'm wondering why. would think 'horror' footage could used change hearts minds mask-wearing issue.

Reading article says ""hospitals hit 99% capacity"" really drive point home. God Bless America................where ignorance acceptable tolerated, encouraged. 

What ironic is.......this HEALTH club.............duh...... 8 days date talking numbers last week. Yes 2 weeks ago better place now. ratio positive tests accounts increased testing clearly rise. China successfully develops first covid19 vaccine, blacklists US getting retaliation US blaming China pandemic? Well shows can’t believe articles posted here. It’s fucking circle jerk point. I’m free speech it’s tiring hearing people saying bad America time. Like yeah country shambles right sometimes criticism goes far, almost point racism. Literally saw comment said something along lines “I hope Americans suffer die. Fuck trump fuck Americans.” mean, sure it’s military? Maybe they’re testing prison population results come they’ll say “we trial con 20.000 people”. Won’t matter prisoners military civilian volunteers. 

This makes sense. would think logical step try first massive prison population.

Of course; says haven’t already? it’s formality go run “military” get credible numbers actually share

Not world would much admitted testing prisoners though anyway... 🤔 continue rate Texas, feel like hit capacity available beds quickly... things could get New York ugly soon. Nope. wrong. Facts care feelings. simply example possible solution (of many) taking issue everyone getting license. isn’t hard fast rule standard. also, side note: class rank isn’t arbitrary-it’s literally indicator performed law school peers. 

there also never pandemic administration bar exam, far know. inevitably last minute decisions. 

my state hasn’t even told us taking exam yet. emailed us today saying exam could canceled moment. there’s anything upset it’s arbitrary, unfair, silent decision making state supreme courts.

if you’re interested current situation bunch resources r/lawschool vaccine tested safety - version 2 kills 50 people &amp; version 1 kills 60 people version 2 considered ""safe"" Less dogwhistle lie execs tell believe they're contributing world positive way. going get reeeeeeeeeal N.J sandwich! That's even 1/10th cost bring drug market. Love Halifax. I'm DAL grad actually met wife there.

Stay safe!  Impressive. (Not) right message, they're yelling wrong people. Zack wrong. *so* reddit comment calling right positive score, yet actual comment negative (and say peril LOL) China worried people dying it’s serious.

China always worried people dying. 

Deliberately ignoring lots human rights issues yes, China human life always big deal. way cooks getting get evicted paying rent... see coming from, guess get pleasure trying get right.

I grew southern cooking fell love cooking Greek food. Completely different everything used cool feel like kid kitchen again.

I still struggle clean go, stay top mess.. either way, enjoying food awesome thing. Life short there's lot things eat.  Prosecutors human scum. wonder go around infecting people quarantining. Fucking piece shit. Yea want go back bars friends damn bad, I’m going get things control. seems like horrible idea Seriously! Japan's government legit bungled initial response back March, oh can't cancel Olympics. Back convinced Japan hiding numbers badly Abe burying head sand. realized Japan free press would've heard overflowing hospitals things got bad Wuhan there. looks like, even though Japan's numbers *are* higher East Asian nations, effective containing virus considering little effort government put in. 

Honestly that's convinced face masks one important means stopping pandemic. It’s going boil mask usage areas people present. mask = higher risk infection. point lot contributing factors, largest significant simply mask usage...and issue Florida, enact policies necessary sad wasted breath. nothing get people nowhere. much think cost? Keep mind cost $1 billion dollars develop, manufacture, test, they’ve giving away free months. 

My point you’re basing nothing feeling - way antivaxxers think. Someone tell guy snowflake shirt getting COVID lot worse obese. number deaths increases tenfold, number infected persons also increase tenfold. reach one million, one tenth Wuhan’s population. ridiculous assume infection degree deceived number infected people 100,000 levels. several months since Wuhan opened up, millions infected people, take longer clear virus.  I’m NJ resident, bars closed since March. places remained open grab drink either liquor stores restaurants. way, restaurants recently reopened outside dining only, beforehand could order curbside takeout. take guess, would assume whole thing less “knuckleheads” greedy bars following proper social distancing procedures. probably listened medical experts CDC said 99.6% get survive. No, coronavirus subreddit, concerned effects virus particularly lethal impoverished minority communities. concern primarily risk mortality there, I'm sorry, comes education concerns.

Second that, think? Upper/middle classes work? kids get less behind afford private tutors nannies?  No, course not.  suffer here.  
Very wealthy families ones relatively unaffected.  sad...so many people unemployed struggling, postpone outcome months. :( hoax New York got head start California going record, hard. 

Prepare lockdowns now. China actually indefinite future. 

That literally means *forever*, necessary. 

China never shut SARS / MERS / H1N1 scanning, reason expect would shut COVID-19 measures. 

Their economy largely back.

In China, point merely ""flatten curve"" hospitals, *completely* eradicate virus domestically. Lockdown ""targeted"" limited.  China can't let small outbreaks become big ones, would Wuhan-scale disasters. federal crime. arrested, charged, prosecuted incarcerated. new favorite non-existent thing ""mask-shaming"" people claiming occurring wear mask even though *they* need mask, + mUh FrEeDuMb! great economy! metro Atlanta local water park opening Friday.

Don’t shy reach out, kid. year could encapsulated single meme would [this understand people think wearing masks protects others. That's simply true

I've literally downvoted saying this. People idiots. decent ones youtube. I’m worried happens decide re-open schools though. First all, GTA ton schools high populations, would make social distancing nearly impossible, cleaning would impossible. Schools perfect breeding grounds regular disease, Nevermind COVID. second part even every student wore mask, would probably cause masks material face coverings sell rapidly. applied large businesses somewhat well. Unless vaccine extremely effective treatments, full re-opening schools workplaces awful idea. agree use medical services get sick, I'd lot amenable activities likely collapse healthcare system, economy, both. 😉 Yes this. Still can’t get complacent. taking note reopening quickly done several us states. Slow measured need let guard down. Wait, snowflake mean triggered easily entitled? Yelling someone asked wear mask fits description.

It's projection. People like guy constantly whining ""snowflakes"" biggest ""snowflakes"" all.  articles claims new, much like saying contagious, need take grain salt course. articles talk potency changing becoming less well, honesty need patient practicing safety guidelines released.

Trump authority release vaccine matter much would want. pushing endorsements hydrochloriquine stating awesome/safe/effective nixed stopping use trials. case I'll let know effective first vaccine since work healthcare forced I'm sure lol

Be safe friend God bless :) Kansans same... really shitty trolling. Try reasonable ideas, dear fogged-up, uninhibited, aggressive, depressed, autonomic person. Better English would help too. can't say disagree you. America lead many points history, democracy weren't, right side world wars, we've lacked moral authority often we've lead. help we've felt authority worth dozens countries we've friends often we've friendly. 

The fact carry biggest stick simply enough carry arrogance anymore. We're decline whether us willing admit not.

I think coincidence number least talked media Yeah, leaders look hot AF? Didn’t think so! pandemic, sure. could win landslide. 

Otherwise, he's received criticism lot things. make matters exciting, apparently another potential flu pandemic starting China. 2020 gift keeps giving.

The people saying ""if black people would obey law wouldnt get shot police"" arent going wear masks ""id like see someone make me!""

Fuck assholes.

Edit: Im kansan though, they're teaming scam us.

Insurance companies want look good feel need them, accomplish ""Negotiating"" price.
Hospitals know this, charge outrageous amounts, knowing paid fraction. 
Over time Hospitals inflate cost, letting insurance look like they're negotiating larger larger amounts (convincing us would ruined insurance exist)


Insurance companies exist 100% unnecessary. Abolish them, recruit workforce make government single ""negotiator"" sets price things. insurance premiums, move part money taxes fund system, end Americans left money pockets (and co-pays thing). Pay hospitals actual cost things reasonable margin profit. 

Obviously incredibly simplified happen night man... healthcare system US fucked much insurance companies positioning necessary cog profit system. ooooo caring people sucks huh two reasons installing UV lights inside HVAC system. 

the first common reason reduce bacteria, mold, buildups coils inside unit. treating air itself, coils. long term exposure, operating 24/7, keeps buildup growing first place, reduces removes existing buildup older systems. used cleaning air, keeping system efficient. additional benefit keeping mold building system, reduce allergens air stream.

the second less common still utilized reason cleaning air itself. speed air, need higher output UV light. addressed installing multiple UV lamps one point HVAC system, spreading UV lights throughout duct. give air stream one big burst UV light multiple small bursts UV light. specific system used depends HVAC system better suited installation. think it’s foolish juncture plan anything 30 days advance Cannibalism It’s surge dude Interesting idea, really hope tax dollars werent spent this.

Thanks. guess theres good way though. negative, negative, negative, positive - counted 4 times? be, right? Certainly least first negative counted subsequent positive well. sure I'm thinking since there's way treated way across states much less countries. Reddit said 0 cases protests though.

I'd suggest adding element type face covering. assumption be, masks offer value. N95 mask surgical mask offer value bearer cloth mask. course, self-benefit self-survival may completely encourage complete mask-wearing. assumption Asian countries ill-prepared stockpiling proper medical masks general public use rest world, significant assumption make. 

The amount prior experience outbreaks Age would also important consideration. IE: Asian countries' attitudes towards masks vary terms exposure previous pandemics.  I'm completely certain I'd want use Asia comparison core societal values. Mask wearing likely 'saving face'. one side keeps getting ostracized other

Not side anyway. sub linked plenty mockery side, whether get mocked back going change that. Save lives???

New York - 1,617 dead per 1m

Florida - 168 dead per 1m

Tell politicians costing people lives previous studies posted, authors studies concede published EMs show purified particles, definitely possess purified particles claimed viral. 

Some researchers use term “isolation” papers, procedures described therein represent proper isolation (purification) process. Consequently, context term “isolation” misused. 

It's astounding authors four principal, early 2020 papers claiming discovery new coronavirus concede proof origin virus genome viral-like particles cellular debris, pure impure, particles kind. 

 that’s ask whether one single paper SARS-CoV-2 isolated finally really purified know publication. think finding new ""normal.""

That's tenth country whole . . . mean read article gives names positions.... wonder much due Memorial Day opening, much due police protests. Sadly, given polarizing attitudes, neither side may really want know truth. I'm talking worldwide. point still stands though. get takes 6 weeks see deaths rise...? 3 weeks protests are, massive spikes... 3 weeks we'll start see deaths.. people afraid. think ""right now""... again, silly mask. hard wear it! SARS 10% mortality rate first one. Fauci lied efficacy masks. prominent scientific organizations lied things. I'm upset anybody many Americans listen scientific community, end day, repeatedly lying public important aspects pandemic. frustration directed scientists lying, public learned trust them.  [Yeah, want people packed closely together need survive another half year least reach 2/3rds another good number months vaccine production distribution. wish good luck. Beleive not, actually discussed doctors charge trial process lot radical given dire circumstances. One doctor said trying promote actually infecting volunteers trial. young, healthy people risk would small, still. I'm sure I'd that. influenza highly mutegenic strain almost entirely different virus. overall point entirely inaccurate . 100% reach appreciable group immunity influenza strains.

the behavior skeptics require us take stand protect families. testy alot skeptics based political leanings , thing read New England Journal Medicine.

there reckless souls got infected socializing regret it.

“bro people dying. people dying knowing could potentially done prevent it” 

And could prevent spread highly contagious virus?


“if staffing resources.”

Staffing resources prevent virus. fact prevention right reduction. 


“this watching dozens people die week may lived decades longer catch virus.”

More dozen people die every week conditions Covid infections.


“it's sending mother C section knowing never meet baby. shut fuck up”

This happens death general. “shut fuck up” portion, right back child. What's going that? thing happening Reno This.

I've heard billionaire say, ""We make sure poor essential workers get first.""

And I'm like, ""Dude, trying kill third yacht. first."" way 150 million US residents infect end 2020 summed pretty well, additional points - normal times, ICUs full, usually pick least-sick person ICU transfer step-down unit little earlier, freeing proper ICU bed/staff. pandemic, everyone ICU really need there, may possible. 

We capability transfer sick patients hospitals space ICUs, transportation capacity also limited (there many medical helicopters capable long distance transfer) patients need ICU levels care less likely survive journey average patient. Something like that, yeah. Sounds bad...but also vaccines - we're good Flu vaccines Stop electing empowering White boomer men. Haven’t seen enough consistent failures throughout human history!! 500k yearly influenza deaths

360 millions people USA

You really believe half million die yearly one single illness ?
It's 10K 40K : covid already killed way, way more. objectively annoying wear seat belt limiting motion car. I'll outside going life tied millions others growing. can't deal drive Yes, banned. many irresponsible people here.  hold 20% world population.

Goddamn, summer experience CA days? reduces wildfires, awesome, seems like... poorly applied bandaid, know? sympathies y'all. india think costs dollars Jesus please everyone go vegan already least local farms. Every restaurant sources factory farms. got lucky covid low ifr source chance? 

Your comment coherent, totally makes sense, really want false. way goes tits up! Interestingly enough, Canada confirmed cases traced protests noticeable spike municipal regional case numbers following protests. seems like factors could contributed:

- lower infection rates prior protests, fewer sick people showed up

- strictly outdoor events, probably lower participation many parts US

- high mask usage (at protests, unfortunately general)

- help organizers police supplying PPE sanitizer

- tear gas-induced coughing

- social distancing parts protests, tightly packed ones mostly marches rather standing shouting one spot day

- many repeat protests: usually one two big ones per city, people getting exposed standing around different crowds week later agree, bathrooms, stores, restaurants, group gatherings beach, etc still make problem. everyone used common sense, issue, become clear can't rely average person's common sense.  even form government, role government crisis. government take responsibility supposed take crisis? Asian countries proper preparation far less casualty, democracy like SK authoritarian like China Vietnam.
Europe still leads US death per capita. shit together handling perfect. got control exactly took Chinese way: locking people home.  mean, know people went protests get tested. Probably 10 really sit think. lot young people variety reasons test, mostly boils selfishness. amount times I've heard people get tested can't bothered look up, afraid test, simply want know mind boggling given capacity test higher numbers. I'm shaming can't get tested lack access (no health insurance means get testing center), people know fall categories. Completely derails point BLM protests get tested disease disproportionately morbid BIPOC, 100% support protests.

It's possibility people spread virus protests unknowingly. Mask usage, protesters staying one spot long, outdoor transmission harder general washing/sanitizing hands kept numbers low, absolutely people caught due protests. think we'll see spike them, ignore likely spread virus counterproductive. Yet, European leaders cry trump says wants spend less defense. 😂 /r/agedlikemilk Then... become immune, longer vectors. Haha sorry don’t mean laugh pain that’s somewhat funny image. know feeling. mono years back bad shit liver down, jaundice everything. Spent week hospital IV.

Surgical masks wire nose bridge typically wire nose bridge little tube-like seam (sort like drawstring pair sweat pants little sewn channel around waist). 

If make little cut sharp pair scissors, could slide new flexible piece wire higher quality one there.

Here's video shows general idea. guy swaps cheap little wire much sturdier one (too sturdy, opinion, certainly works well). mean, totally control narrative. Look idiots barking closures, masks, freedumbs, etc. believe virus big deal. I'll read thoroughly later lot comments opinions months old, since data come prove otherwise. people say now? Also outliers? probably cherry pick info want idea masks connection people heads politics one side keeps getting ostracized other. Notice US country sees political? Right. Exactly. It’s also hard factor fact soo many people working right now. remember total number cases 50k..in world. 3 months later 10 million cases nobody gives single shit. It’s appalling. Absolutely good they're going hold Orlando Florida cases rising. know Jokic SARS COV-2 COVID-19 met Novak Djokovic. Disruption learning horrible kid’s educational path, poor education huge factor future life outcomes like heath. There’s research suggesting least resourced kids may lost year math knowledge March/April- end year shutdown alone.

Make M&amp;M test, though, completely fail. I'd guess overloaded labs/testing sites. 

That happen. States like New York New Jersey seem control, places testing lot people before, lot spare testing capabilities states. Florida simply ship tests labs get results. might wait couple days, pretty doable. mean shit blame ? shit fucked, they're wrong lockdowns. really sucks go back work. Unpopular perhaps, stop excusing some
protests vs others regards COVID risk? Yes, differences (outside vs inside), there’s reason we’re asked social distance well. Also, plenty people protests wearing masks wearing incorrectly. think getting confused headline, read whole piece.

It says discouraged use masks CDC already recommending them, way implies Fauci ""spent months unequivocally saying masks nothing people don’t need them."" lockdown Italy solved problem without things like careful reopening testing/tracing.

a lockdown solve problem. beautiful tirade, meant physical resilience ^(the process adapting well face adversity, trauma, tragedy &amp; threats.)

Resilience synonymous **immunity**, see riding high mighty white horse gonna use less synonyms reply you, although common practice avoid repeating word again. 

So far, zero evidence towards *immunity* novel corona. antibodies, cells, actually way bodies capable getting rid virus, recognising destroy human host cell. 

So kills people, body *does not* *immunity* virus therefore host cells gets destroyed, literally drowning many infected lung tissue comes apart. 

A couple individuals believe virus corona family gives *immunity*, ain't really enough bring anybody oblivion virus bodies zero genetic *immunity* against, tools takes, bring everything humans built themselves, oblivion. 

You seem argue *immunity* dropped sky, no, indeed created us, countless generations, ton pathogens earth, completely harmless humans. 

Our DNA met pathogens past fight DNA blueprints literally preventing harm us. 

Some involves DNA locks prevents pathogens mutating DNA, aspects involves *immunity* molecules created spine.

Nah bro make make sense least Bar fair amount outdoor space could conceivably use careful diligent social distancing. 

D Jais screwed big time area US least want consider roughly 3 weeks infection average death (if one dies it) sure roll back whatever denominator using case count around far backwards.

likely we'll see number deaths start coming we're 3 weeks first day new spike  I've read anecdotal reports many offices states like FLorida, Texas, etc never closed, least long. small percentage NJ NY office workers working home even now.

Remember, exposure TIME too. air conditioned environment going spend time outside home? office. office full people whose interactions can't account for, nowhere near much home family.

If possible - WORK. FROM. HOME. Nobody putting life risk soothe egos normalize pathology busy body middle management types. prop commercial real estate. playing blame game. pointing facts.

But, ever know - since happen.

Also, comparing small, mostly islandic countries concentrated population areas much good comparison much bigger countries much complex economies geopolitical systems. cold. wait, cases April, 15 current cases zero.

And you’re right, Quebec unlucky start they’ve really done well get control, averaging 80 cases per day since Thursday.

I don’t know wtf Ontario point. protecting farm workers, one thing. followed rules instead letting unmasked filthy mouthbreathers pack everywhere without restrictions wouldnt sent rooms think theyve done. Almost like head start? Wait till hear Fed prevent another sell stock market. Michigan too. got home dinner actually Don’t go. worth it. Pisses Illinois finally caving.

Now, STILL feel like I'm different world states opposite reasons. feel complacent feel much safer days. feel safer, threat virus gone even lessened, people I'm seem taking precautions seriously. I'm actually impressed social norms seem evolved almost overnight. like sudden, span days, became completely unacceptable go store without mask. can't imagine must like live somewhere people care. thought really scares me. I'm glad live live. MuH RiGhTS!

You lot. decent healthcare society looked vulnerable would position. challenging idea lockdown detrimental wellbeing US incumbent government! blows fucking mind people opposed welfare state.

Because brown people would benefit. Virtually Trump supporters would racially restricted welfare state, i.e. National Socialism. think pcr.

I thought since listed ""current"" effect time. not? Yes there’s obviously crowds nothing like back may.

I find hard believe crowds worse back May now. telling Danes slowly accepted restrictions following better, saw fines handed realize Denmark pretty much back normal? 

You really making sound like differences like night day, assure not. describing great want see. Sweden experiencing excess deaths, hospitals past capacity, hospitalized falling steadily proportion mild cases found testing rising quickly. disease spreading widely Sweden Denmark, yet deaths hospitalizations down. 

I think makes sense argue necessary hand fines people visiting public spaces. obviously source spreading, authorities showing off.

That whole point debate here, remember? sure solution response sustainable whole, told otherwise. know world live parents work least 9-5.

Call chinese bot whatever but.... west really fucked up. Yeah, knew already look way well...


I live China shit got locked fast, everyone quarantined effective measures COVID taken. Regardless false statistics etc, something done immediately every comply. locked approx. 3 months.


The West however, put lockdown dilly-dallied god knows long? lockdown for, everyone even listening advice?


The West also locked feels like one govt idea do. feels like entire lockdown waste. hardships; financially mentally nought.


I bad thoughts locked really empathizing West STILL lockdown clear end sight people keep fucking going govt can't set/enforce real rules.


I know everyones fault handling govts absolute disgrace really feel sorry you. cost? Human lives? money? Arguably important one, lock aged care facilities.

""The man behind SW Corona response"" also admitted late lock aged care facilities mistake.

 happens ""unusual"" storm activity, aka predicted storms climate change think virus eradicated here, deffintly control! “the nation’s capital proved heavily infested.” It’s live die.  It’s live get permanent organ damage leading disability, die.

And younger people likely disabled older people likely die outright.

PS organ damage shows med scans, that’s know permanent.  there’s much damage. people reposting last 4 days? 🤔 Looks like time change. things old outdated. Who's whining? care less. planted anything two decades, hate painting. found restrictions fucking hilarious. Yes fault, complacency led this. Educate educate children way fix nonsense. Seek primary sources, turn damn TV. Stop garnering information old news sources (Unless NPR) Seek conquer bilateral thinking applies two party nonsense going states. Demand elected officials. Study history sociology, mistakes repeated. Trust process make dogma get ahead socioeconomic political change. Still think would seen cases creep two weeks earlier did. makes sense ""economy must open crowd"". virus controlled get. beginning everything okay. Economy growing virus slowly hits. stores close. Stock market goes down. Eventually virus everywhere stores shut everything shut down. put bonds, gold, real estate treasuries. come back equities, question if, when.  War Worlds quote?

“They undone, destroyed, man's weapons devices failed, tiniest creatures God wisdom put upon earth.” Good guy oregon yet, start now? It’s live die.  It’s live get permanent organ damage leading disability, die.

And younger people likely disabled older people likely die outright. 

PS organ damage shows med scans, that’s know permanent.  there’s much damage. It’s tragically sad. “*I told so*” place here, damn... Austin majorly impacted makes even worse! purpose confinement also reduce number accidents leads people going ICU first place. 1 case imported Egypt

Only 1 local case, Sabah.

We almost zero!!! Unless employer compensating them, many people can't afford stay home 2 weeks.

Some may even ALLOWED sort thing universities need attacking right now. 

Find way take one time advantage significant issue find right something could possible otherwise.

It heart breaking wasting resources trying convince plague rats infect could changing entire fucking world. many adults (including parents) outright opposed masks know kids/teens gonna talking points teach tries enforce mask rule. That's featurette. Always great marketing stunt. Korea employs something similar. China. That's contain disease like Politifact also confirms  like watching fall Rome, WiFi Oh agree completely. Lol. debates going entertaining. Lmao know well worked Mr. Ryan, we!? Former criminal time like responsible citizen. *sneezes* Mongolia population like 3 million. business give fuck business soon.

People give fuck dead soon.

And point give fuck them. ""People"" like reeducation camps invented.  Share this, maybe help few... train left weeks ago. virus 14 day cause effect delay. fact water parks even open grosses out! Water parks breeding grounds best times gross thinking people wanna swim around human broth. Yuck. mean idk virus could even survive pool water still gross lol Negative freedom = Randian Man, still whining gardening supplies could ordered internet. Maybe Florida Texas could tried taking seriously record setting spikes. Michigan one best states mitigating spread. care though. go ""lockdown flatten peak"" ""lockdown get vaccine""? Oh, thanks clarifying. upswing. 

What find interesting deaths seem swing correlation number positiv tested. 

I want imply anything, want honest discussion.

 start, curves goes right way.

From top head:

social distancing like recommending people work home keep distance going shopping

improving sick leave payment

constant message ""wash hands, stay home sick""

the improvements hospital care like countries avoid example blood cloths

send kids home day care school show slightest sign cold/flu

remote learning unis high school (16 yo+)

some domestic travel restrictions

&amp;#x200B;

More? worrying googled ""Florida pneumonia deaths 2019 vs 2020"" first news based theory spread Twitter Reddit week insinuating Florida health officials masked toll coronavirus labeling thousands deaths caused pneumonia supported facts, said experts study morbidity statistics."" good guidelines a) walked back made less strict b) every county applied got variance open phase met state's criteria? meh, lot evidence protests spread virus. know common sense reason going die common sense also rarely correct. need scientists. OH NO.

JUST GOING WATER, WARM ENOUGH!!! Yeah- real great ones crushing students tanks 80s certainly _not_ COVID-death, COVID means disease disease. kind predictive power would give include different kind cases one number?

COVID-related deaths, could go with. simply go with: deaths caused insufficient resources. Said everyone entire country, creating problem peak prosperity brother arms:) lockdown goals cause that. Comparable comfortable waiting rain know bus coming exact time VS standing rain seems like never ending amounts time Bad bot. many children died covid-19 US? Glad live IL. keep reading states starting things daily life months. wish nation done similarly Europe, state well guess. Okay let's get factual.

The fucking reason we're shitbed because... shit bed. Multiple times. fact deliberately took laxatives made exclusively brown-toned Jackson Pollock.

We told **over half-century** radically change energy consumption caloric sources.

What do? [We fucking doubled fossil fuel consumption. do? [We fucking sextupled meat consumption. locusts ravaging parts Africa Bangladesh higher frequency storms specific desert region would experience frequency water. literally triggers biological transformations grasshopper become plague-like locust know.

Because climate change causes storms storms new regions.

Covid19 ravaging globe high meat consumption, meat culture sheer sheer lack animal welfare across Asia. We're **really** overdue something catastrophic domestically, let's even talk much superbug waiting mutate evolve, overpumping antibiotics livestock.

That also even matter, livestock exceptionally inefficient retrieving calories feed population. incredibly water expensive pollutant.

2020 really first stage many, many worse things come.

Yeah, going get worse. **lot** worse.  Certain types people swayed emotional tugs heart raw facts processed logically.  anecdote backed scientific data, (rather used create scientific narrative) great use using personal experience examples teaching tool.  

Like science tell us HIV AIDS are, work, patient tell us lived experience coping catching living them. Yeah, totally agree. 

This tsunami disease coming us slow speed, look bad comparison hurricane 9/11. reality worst public health crisis 100 years...

We see pans CDC drops knowledge truth. incredible insight. Thank CDC!!!!!!!!! Holy shit, Poland panic think situation bad 350-400 new daily cases 40k total, Florida would beat us 6 days. definitely alone numb it. entire country freaked fuck 3 months ago spread nowhere even close bad, locked houses bought 70 years worth toilet paper shelf stable food. look absolute disaster like eh... guess maybe think closing bars...? 

That said, really longer worldwide problem. mean is, isn't. can't truly rid vaccine, definitely huge crisis everywhere like US. example, almost every European country completely control, cases dwindling weeks months straight holding steady manageable level. Italy, example, among first planet get absolutely hammered this, cut daily cases 5-6k range march pushing thousand deaths day, way well thousand mid may, holding steady low hundreds ever since, deaths occasionally dropping single digits. That's, like, inconvenience worst. news reports us responsibly social distancing beach unlike stupid Floridians also beach. swear reporting completely biased yet tell one image except CA always put ocean left screen right FL. democracy, *that's problem.* admin place right via voter apathy, voter suppression, decade long smear campaigns, voter disenfranchisement foreign interference. Even actually democracy we'd Hillary currently resounding 3 million plus votes. 

I mean get ""They"" actually know much American politics probably country's, ya know, glass houses given exact problems pretty common plenty country's currently. Bill, US response pandemic embarrassing, shamefull embarrassing. idea one nation could fck bad. That's pretty cool. Good news hear New Zealand's news! white women love this? wonder anyone sees photos catching hell something dumb ruining progress made No, like home elderly people nurses. would probably good option needed evacuate elderly people nursing homes didn’t want get used new living arrangements. could repurpose current nursing homes don’t need move. 

(I left /s comment above) Another month another Pandemic Surely they’ll cancel this.. maybe won’t anyone left support trump convention time interesting piece found describes Swedish response:

 I'll take look right now. democracy. Idiocracy

looks like equivalent suppose arguably case cure worse decease 0 desire eat go movies, want walmart open earlier 7am. work nights fucking inconvenience able go night quiet, pop way home work 6.30am. Fucking extend hours walmart. throw him. Population decline ain’t great social programs. something passes Phase Three safe populations.

Safety established well phase 3. Happy hear managed recover mess, incident still mess.

Due proximity frequent border-crossing, chances returning, infected Dane/Finn/Norwegian slip cracks cause mess. Whether they'll cause outbreak get lucky like Zealanders, time tell. point making. agree! .2 microns. ""Even qualification billionaire""

Credit u/GailaMonster comment: 


""To extent Mr. Gates taken secondary focus career tech, public health. consider second career. He's dumb math he's dumb systems; Fauci would probably tell listen Fauci him, anyway. Thus Mr. Gates demonstrable restraint even endorsement comments sorely lacking LESS intelligent, yet self-assured contributors (who people listening gusto). 

Further resources rival small nation, make significant beneficial contribution effort (and fact so). Thus, WOULDNT listen Bill Gates this? He's actually paying attention something, he's even calling expert.

If dilute bloviations people like Elon Musk topic, glad Bill Gates speaking up.""


So short, disregard fact pretty much dedicated second half life medical shenanigans, THOUSANDS doctors working him, warned us possible pandemic ~5 years, statement is:

**""There reason anyone walking around mask on""**

\-Anthony Fauci, March 2020 People throwing giant house parties? real idiots deserve sympathy.

I disagree bit. I'm SoCal predominately Latino neighborhood. Working class, lower middle class. big family gatherings state opened things up. big family gatherings started again. government said OK. people watching things closely people sub are. blame following rules government set. Restaurants, bars big gatherings never OK'ed. Bars open. top risk activities open either. Public health doctors rated various activities according risk. Bars number one followed closely large music concerts, sports stadiums, gyms, amusement parks, churches buffets. Exactly, BMI tell whole story. jumped gun rush open economy that’s fucked. It’s like expected everything reopen everyone would got back work. good percentage jobs completely eliminated. exposure virus mutate populations become vulnerable. becoming nightmare one waking from. I’m fearful future holds. taking first vaccine gate. I'm fool unlike idiots.

But dude, suggesting British strangers ethnic cleansing pretty ahistorical.  question - different time? average person consuming social media hopefully least one news source, changed minds think? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* worked bar 6 years. I'd feel business owners fact fundamental purpose bar sucker gullible people.

Pay $3-4 beer, retail $1-2. Tip someone popping top you. Mixed drinks worse, easily paying half cost BOTTLE liquor retail 1-2 shots worth mixed drink. Plus tip. Plus cover charge. Plus Uber ride home. cost DUI Uber home.

Most bars true ""mixologist""; someone trained make drink perfectly, encyclopedic knowledge make Rusty Nail Bellini, drink that's ""BLANK Coke"". paying amazing service, paying bar middle man lazy host people house. hit ABC store. people throw bathroom.

Bars inherently social interaction (and getting gouged), that's literally ONE thing can't right now. 100,000 people get sick die. want cut damned hair. Screw everyone else. say it’s like 5 days still symptoms likely virus then? Yes, deluding myself. Oh, Atlantic's Covid tracking project: led Trevor Bedford, Associate Member Fred Hutch Vaccine Infectious Disease Division Computational Biology Program, Affiliate Associate Professor Department Genome Sciences Department Epidemiology University Washington, co-developer NextStrain.org

But yeah, I'm sure you, Mr Poptart, know much better research consisting headlines /r/coronavirus. Best luck brother. Stay safe crazy times. Unfortunately, yes. many people lost someone already they're aware need do, I've seen morons say ""yeah, uncle/grandpa/grandma got sick died, s/he old."" 🤦

For take nothing less death's door **themselves**. get mad small business owner who's business dying situation. lose $200 per day rent, utilities payroll. We're open online pick business less half normally business. rely job living expenses taken leave.

It sucks but, I'd rather people lived put people risk. believe are! live touristy beach town. Tons people coming in. However, every store I've into, people wearing masks (properly), beach, everyone spread out, time not, people put mask social distancing unavoidable. 

I'm runner I'm runner runs mask on. Thank you! Well yes, surgical masks protecting community individual. people means sacrificing save others. ""could"" 

Also said could see 2 million dead US. Yall need understand one really give accurate number many factors come play Same. I;ve missed parties events. real friends phone number email reach me.  feel much better Facebook although get shamed time time 4 adorable kids think travesty show FB 'gram Yeah, help us improve embarrassingly low reputation across world. last month I’ve gone five restaurants, two brewery tap rooms, three bars, Indian casino stayed hotel packed pool DJ. 

Maybe I’m immune covid. Chinese vaccine skipping phase 3 trials. first, dude. get it, get mild symptoms, say flu, days later family member gets dies, survivors guilt hopefully speak public experience important wear mask.  think we'll see anti-maskers like two men show freedom speech.

Seriously, look them! like they're intentionally trying project droplets far onto someone diligently trying maintain social distancing following mask protocol. Portland, Oregon area. glad happening. concerned enforcement this. hoping Gov. Kate Brown provision people could fined.  1 Dollar Bob! Absolutely. soon there's solid peer-reviewed science, I'm in. Even Oxford vaccine absolutely zero peer-reviewed papers results. going stage 3 trials, where's data stage 1/2 that's supposed guide stage 3? important get vaccines quickly, also important right.

I'm absolutely certain scientists doctors involved best job anyone could possibly do. Also certain tremendous political financial pressure deliver.

I want see science. welcome! Well, bad looking forward cut short. Maybe they'll get another opportunity another year two. told us wear masks March.

""Experts"" one blame themselves. forget, parts U.S masks mandatory. Elkhart County, Indiana example. Unfortunately, also large population idiots areas mandatory. Florida, everywhere.

For illness/sicknesses/diseases covered tou need general life insurance (which offered department btw). health insurance it’s chronic disease, meds &amp; equipment free. Age shouldn’t deciding factor chronic disease - didn’t get type 1 37. We’re boned  History says otherwise. People simply create black markets products, selling dangerous variants banned goods.

I would, however, like hear emergency paragliding speak of. actually agree bar owner. Bars blamed spread. However, goes bar pandemic? People think get big deal. 

It almost like significant cheating blame person... significant other. Bars punished patrons irresponsible. Paywall. simple huh. define “safe it”? \*inserts stubborn dude-bro meme\* Florida style Covid-19 recipe: Take group likely infected, make angry, put small room shouting. Let reach boiling point. quicker results add obesity co-morbidities. Kinda bums out. dad said something along lines sad see country fall apart. 

Which says alot he's immigrant giant shithole country interracial marriage 60s... partly politicians old touch s*** f****** understand little bit money going go anywhere long. Americans died Covid died WWI. incorrect walked back prefer jefa boss though sunshine. McConnell brings lot money Kentucky form pork barrel. makes sure voters know this. Massachusetts recently requires every state except like 7 8 others northeast quarantine 14 days upon entry.

For record, Massachusetts actually ""requires"" nothing, masks, quarantine, anything else. They're suggestions. penalties adhering suggestions, tracking system state visitors. apparently wrong criticize people obesity chunk

CCP year prepare. went drive seal beach, people beach part using actively spaced apart. drove past Main Street packed, shoulder shoulder maybe 1/30 people mask on. booed fast. opposed Pasadena, CA almost everyone saw mask on.

I friends family far away wouldn’t really communicate otherwise, don’t want completely disconnect. I’ve wondered myself. Sometimes websites papers report situation vaccines don’t even mention one, one earliest possible date. read vaccine may given two separate doses couple weeks apart 300 million might mean 150 million people effectively vaccinated. 

The bigger issue may it’s well get 300 millions vaccine doses USA getting everyone vaccinated might take months. maybe people mean wont get vaccine year? 

Generally reporting vaccines confusing. Omg

Well. I'm going current totals. 5% tested positive died far (forget unresolved cases sake conservative). Making allowances increased testing, assuming 3% going pipeline today die seems right. 100k new cases per day means 3k/day deaths pipeline. 40k cases per day pipeline means 1200 deaths/day pipeline. 20k cases per day means 600 deaths/day pipeline. delay cases deaths around 2-3 wks. Seems fit current data. It’s local affiliate dude lot unnecessary National pride nations.

Agreed. funny it’s mostly friendly.

I agree historically case. always took rivalry totally joking, nothing serious surface. least ciricle Danish friends people genuinely angry way Sweden handled crisis, old ""jokes"" quite ""joke-y"" one also likely get upset rants Carlsberg three. know friends since many social media groups esp. sometimes teh comments DR, etc. legit angry. ""Swedes arrogant haha kind cute?"" ""those damn arrogant Swedes putting us danger"". FWIW situation even intense Finland observations friends social media written / complained about: think ""peace time"" everything normal relations strained one member behaving badly crisis way puts others danger, yes 99% joking / sibling rivalry. think changing interesting (and tbh genuinely sad) see real animosities surface, ready precipitated crisis. deleted mine saying read original comment zero reason delete it. realize bad moderation sub, kind big deal pretty important sub.

Also, defense people, hospitals like Houston first say capacity issues, reel back in. don’t you? don’t, say did? do, taking back? see types details confusing feel misleading. But, IMO, don’t need hospitals full act. no, false outrage clicks Oh sure, I'm enjoying win today, bracing tomorrow, preparing unknown.   wonder United States allowing Remdesivir shipments Iran. Sure, don’t think makes sense vaccinate people millions people unreliable vaccine try get comply getting vaccinated new effective vaccine months later. Nope Ok, watched first episode Dark. I’m curious guy said damn letter... what’s going on?! haha. bad dub doesn’t bother me. think Ragnarok prepared awfulness dubs. 

The first episode new twilight zone boring turn off. Cool idea, poor execution. really like old twilight zones shows like black mirror, skipped ahead episode called six degrees freedom. Really excellent. watch first episode (I think it’s called comedian), don’t like it, wouldn’t quite give yet. well governor like hur dur LIBS SAID WOULD LIKE NEW YORK TWO WEEKS!!. exactly good spot far taken care of. sharp edge sword American values. unless war, Americans come together purpose. general public one? nailed it.  Further, remember lot people voted current president grounds ""he's politician.""  

I think deeper problem America's particular brand crazy, partly result collective narcissism (we're number one), ""rugged individualism"" (which translate ignorant selfishness).  can't tell someone thinks better everyone else wrong, can't tell someone believes total freedom do, even good good everyone know care about. mean sound super dickish, reason ever grocery issues first time around people ""stocking up"". everyone party indoors would go faster. Exponential growth. got car worked weeks ago, people dealership wearing masks customers. Like, understand dealership deciding require workers, feel like choice, least would masks. Kinda felt like instructed, least “gently encouraged” wear them. guess fear looking professional? wanting scare customers? I’m sure.  article entirely accurate. $3000 based estimates total 6 vials may necessary complete treatment. price also low within current pricing Covid treatments. Also, $3000 hospitals pay, pocket costs going full amount hospital Covid treatment going far expensive bills coming way. Yeah idea voting for. Like crabs bucket...  deaths 2-3 weeks likely astronomical. Still maybe lower NY elderly populations took huge hit. wonder hell made list. sounds like utter horseshit shouldn’t sanitizing N95 masks see protests causing spikes areas virus relatively low key, protesting contributing spread meaningful way- indicates high level virus general area prerequisite spread protests, feels like common sense.

UW tested 3000 Seattle protesters recently, less 1% positive, there's initial indication might case. Again, worth specific public narrative shape outcome. clue. let wallow dumbness!  suggesting should. Someone living poverty spending considerable proportion wealth every month though. Thats bring up.

You still answered question though, taxes including make statement. suspect looking taxes salary. Billionaires dont necessarily earn inherit wealth salary. also significant opportunity avoid taxes entirely. Lol realise I'm talking fellow local xD Yes indeed, test positivity rate 40% point  ""The path righteous man beset sides inequities selfish tyranny evil men. Blessed who, name charity good will, shepherds weak valley darkness. truly brother's keeper finder lost children. strike upon thee great vengeance furious anger attempt poison destroy brothers. know Lord lay vengeance upon you."" I’d love new hobby don’t time. spend day taking care son. 'debate' FreedomLand™ like arguing existence gravity.

The hard-core MAGAts far-out woo-sters need shunned excluded, least confined FL, TX &amp; AZ. argument person back May. started whole, ""the flu kills ppl"" &amp; like ""the flu kills 100k ppl every 3 month, every year?"" response. changed topic &amp; jumped next rabbit hole. wish would something mortgages too. I'm landlord regular homeowner I've unable get sort assistance this. never known group consistently wrong 'the customer' believe it’s initial comment seems downplay like it’s big deal. also sounds thought contracted virus reopening.  Hercules? dad? probably kicked doors til got right place wouldn’t surprised start tightening testing criteria again. similar ruckus caused Hugo’s Tacos LA, shut too. 

Back kid, read stories Americans survived genuinely tough times (WWII, Great Depression, pioneer era, etc.) awe. 

However, also figured modern-day Americans asked make sacrifices regular basis nowadays, they’d freak out. Wearing mask relatively small inconvenience compared forebears gone through, it’s protect oneself others. no, society can’t handle it. 

It makes sad hear contemporary Americans full-on public tantrums something minor. We’ve become entitled, spoiled, rude, selfish country, sizable sector seems think kind behavior acceptable, even means putting others risk illness even death. Venom finally come earth! forget killing Affordable Care Act. Can't ER impose strict mask policy? wear mask? GTFO. I’m sure could always use more. plume aerosolized shit

i think ever breath reading  reducing risk. reasoning makes sound like willing forego masks distancing proven 100% effective. asymptomatic ones might suffer damage servers remember spit food. real problem mixed messages. bought masks back February first started hear Coronavirus, started wear March... like alien. 

We basically dropping ball every fucking issue, behind curve every step way. screwed whole planet way way way way WAY lenient China Covid. 

Just look Taiwan... trust thing, one best country control pandemic.

Every country following got screwed hard. took hammer take elephant. close bars then, people go? Kentuckian here. newly elected governor done really good job transparency daily updates. Aside fact Kentucky's unemployment site complete garbage (it's consistently overwhelmed. able even hit login page month. UI resources got completely slashed last two administrations) I've line speak UI rep month now, think he's done good job. 


Of course, know good chunk right-wingers absolutely *despise* governor everything he's prevent virus spreading. think he's huge waste taxpayer dollars daily updates waste time open everything ""normal."" 


We could best transparent leadership world, can't count individual Americans ever rallying together cause. There's always going one jackass going Walmart sneezing face poor employee. know EXPERT is? reads like Onion headline. 70% polio patients asymptomatic. That's spreads easily. something like 29% symptoms flu-like symptoms. remaining 1% get severe cases. Shhhh pull wool far. Locking would also cost more. Even optimistic assumptions vaccine development we've got another year living 'rona, looking measures sustain amount time. 15 years, I'm thinking children would adults. Things going pretty 40 50 years unless make big changes fast. think states are. Others trying dwindle numbers place kind trace contact protocol. sunlight takes almost half hour kill virus plenty time pass it. mean could also result greater poverty migrant communities, less access healthcare services institutionalized racial bias. reasons presented black migrant communities hit harder US would imagine would similar Sweden.

But honestly whole post sounds like attempt shift away blame Sweden’s failed herd immunity policy immigrant communities. New York’s number would lot higher today’s testing capacity. got new Alienware sits day I'm work. need hand? science denying hybrid driver? Wild! 

Curious, think moisture forms inside mask go wearing mask? moisture magically forming wearing it? *are* team-competitions golf, yeah. No, actually New York's numbers plummeted even massive protests. look Minnesota's numbers - epicenter protests growth numbers modest compared others.

No, Arizona, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama others cases spiking common protests. fact led Repub governors 1) reopened quickly 2) followed Prez's lead taking pandemic seriously enough pro-science policies mask wearing, contact tracing, etc.

You can't blame protests, Daniel. nice try.... make mask mandatory?

Lawyers... sayin make decisions based science, feelings perceived righteousness one's cause. protests okay little risk transmission outdoors, even large crowds people, good, evidence-based reason beaches closed. absolutely agree you. live Louisiana knew Marci Gras bad idea. Obviously go, common sense all. idea downvoting comment. funny sad time. Could tell like/ long it?
I’m sure people downvoting either... appreciate advice info could share. 
I gave upvote lol people Iran wondering, then: article Iran 4 weeks ago, replace “Iran” “Eid” “United States” “4th July” like reading current situation almost word word. eerie: make sense? 

The smart, sane, caring people staying home. Karen's Brad's going making everyone's lives living hell. 

The people going distilled Karenite. Starting? last three months? Thanks - helpful. way much money HIV treatment prevention ever vaccine. Events like one suggest going years. lot people trying work anti-violence initiatives No, all. reading Arizona Doctors petitioned state invoke ""crisis care"" limits hospitals liability allows medical professionals triage patients based likelihood survival. like watching old episode MASH, field hospital. yet, asked, people San Francisco would still say even Big One. First, cares race people it’s affecting, people people. Second, non Hispanic Whites probably 1/3rd county.

In beginning, thought Dr. Fauci meant lead this, turns existing system simply ignoring him.... hill people literally wanna die eh? Southern Indiana. Idk area PA, county went green past two weeks. Basically nobody wears mask unless store requires it... pools... restaurants... Hell, people weren’t wearing masks yellow. I’ll shocked don’t surge. lot folks around acting like pandemic over.

FTFY I’m sitting China wife visibly worried 13 cases province that’s 1000s kilometres away shut everything first case, keep reminding least we’re US.  blame Bill 5Gates somehow unexplainable valid supposition. ⬆️ true.

Agreed. uncooperative shitheads appear mostly SoCal. direction? Up?, front? you’re single, get maybe $65k, plus student loan payments. contribute retirement, could another $50-$1000/mo, *should* do. Insurance - renter, car, health, pet, dental, etc - total $200-$750/mo. There’s lot factors, take home pay takes big chunk $100k right start. opinion, It’s unconstitutional. It’s people little understanding constitution whining government telling do.

I’ve seen cite fifth amendment showing unconstitutionality requiring masks. Constitutional rights limited practice right would pose risk public, we’ve seen yelling “fire” theater. Due quick spread sometimes asymptomatic spread COVID-19, people choosing wear masks pose threat public. That’s opinion I’m sure people disagree.

Businesses help accountable allowing people without masks. government inspects businesses time ensure operating safely. business allows people without masks, posing danger community operating safely. penalty needs strong enough businesses motivated comply. hygiene much China poor, extremely different country like Japan. probably huge factor masks can’t totally prevent outbreaks. It’s not.. little month since gym opened 

Go 6 days week 

Thus far single person contracted anything 

Same crew day day 

I #remind I’ll report back another month Came comment this... virus behaving exactly expected. people account for. Water parks open?! Whoa Also 2m social distancing would crowding together compared normal. Also, houses built -20°C mind. They're fucking hot summertime, get outside day. Source : waking 2 separate flats Helsinki house Tampere June years back. first flat little like waking hell.

Unless survive huge hospital bills job f'ed virus work. Go hang them. Grab food restaurant go beach. Didn’t NY shut completely like 3000 day?
LOL Can't fix stupid. Let die. 1. Zolgensma cure SMA, it’s pretty damn good treatment compared what’s available (maybe Risdiplam approved). 

2. actually costs $2.1 million.   

3. compare Spinraza, painful, less effective treatment 400-500k per year, 5 years insurance company pays same, 10 years they’ll save 50-60% treatment alone (if fact never use another treatment). Novartis (owner Zolgensma) also offers 5 year payment plans kinda makes no-brainer vs spinraza. addition, patients zolgensma healthier develop better, savings therapy, hospitalizations, major issues immense. 

4. stats 90% dying teen years waaaay off. Perhaps type 1 SMA Spinraza around. Turns living somewhere cares freedoms, negatives. Second link works.

Holy shit.

Its flu guys! could wrong, think commenter responded trying downplay seriousness virus all. They're saying people immediately dying test positive, true deaths lag cases weeks. [This found average time onset death little 2.5 weeks. wrong thought pandemic would worse rn? low. like saying death rate like 1% (don't quote me) covid overall something. Yet low entire world shutdown called tiny percentage cause add people, makes big difference.

It's true people may gotten covid means. Protestors going night night night though. There's like 39 days protests. Even small fraction 2.5% got covid protests, would still significant.

And assume tiny fraction proof get protests (protester going every night can't imagine much protest).

The pandemic may turn cause devasting amount deaths. assume nothing, play safe tragic would wrong. people stuck home eating nothing rice beans months end would describe “the interest people”. Might cos coin really make level irony up. Agreed. moved IE... go netfragz grab Farmer Boys please. America always global superpower. much money, much influence, much infrastructure, much pop culture...etc cleaning sorts, mean? Bro r talking phase. said phase 3 4 take 6 7-8 months.

Wall shame cherry top ""lost operating license broke public health codes"" sundae. True, heard gunshots nightly Indy. However, gunshots tend carry distance night, tend hear next neighborhood's shootings. fight included language somebody's get shot, beaten heavily. forget data comes idiots tell lied to. think mean median age US 38. median age death COVID US older - old nations like Italy, still older isn’t even 2nd wave yet America.

I'm genuinely curious happens someone tests positive US. sent home look isolated? I’m coupe days late Fauchi actually admitted that..

He also acknowledged masks initially recommended general public first responders feel strain shortage PPE.

He explained public health experts ""were concerned public health community, many people saying this, concerned time personal protective equipment, including N95 masks surgical masks, short supply."" IKR!  keep hearing people say ""masks protect others"" makes sense!

If reduce transmission one direction, both!

But may people sub spend much time informing subject COVID even medical professionals could help? *Coronacane season entered chat* 1 person's mother everyone read thread. completely disproves argument. /s That's beside point, though. Whether think warning needs not, warning there, protect sued, care burned. choose example think less idiotic point stands - remove liability.  use Kaletra. They’ve using successfully Korea country 300 deaths grand total.

I don’t know problem United States researching treatments virus. taken first onset symptoms, stuff works.

And cost $120 14 day supply insurance. Gotta give lungs workout

No rest days! Yeah it’s almost like one people protesting unjustness way people treated police skin. cunt wanting beer. guess people die cuz wanted beer? Also almost al protesters masks on. Well didnt forget, never knew begin calendar.

6 months.  People getting charged $200 tested? Trump wants test less? sounds like incredible grift can't afford hot lunch scared make mandatory. Make much free reduced, big family. can't afford $300 plus month, can't.

Having kids bring lunch boxes seems unsanitary though. Rage Disease. IANAL believe DA choose charge regardless bar wants there’s enough evidence charge her. criminal happening stocks monetary policy. reckoning this, either major crash, hyper inflation, something... Either value dollar crashing quickly (totally possible they've printed) speculators making terrible decisions.

There's going depression years economic hardship, already baked cake here. stock market completely irrational..  Lol one gonna shut swine flu I've always wondered wife Taiwanese.  Masks 100% culturally accepted/embraced/the norm there.  could see wife one person could control Putin/Trump spread among young people, I'd assume we'd see slightly lower death rate...provided somehow keep away older folks. Well masks fit right, I've modded few. really want keep that.  donated billions this. wanted know else involved in. real risk trauma, suicides deaths school closure. kids safer home. hard figure greater risk greater need... least we’re leading recoveries! /s really sucks this, criticism opposition doesn’t help anything. resources scarce , unfortunately make decisions based likelihood survival, well quality life. It’s horrifying one carrying decisions, long ethics board making decisions opposed treating physicians (which good ONE), it’s kind best literally got resources. taken seriously. Complaining “my rights” unfortunately huge contributor south mess now. we’re thinking, Québec, Canada. brutal winters, summers pretty hot humid, probably far tolerable summers US South.

From march may, staying home, number cases constantly increasing. then, weather started good, cases constantly decreasing, even we’re quickly reopening everything.

So, staying inside, covid-19 went up. Now, going out, covid-19 goes down. reason might case US South may summer much harder there, everyone might access swimming spot.

Other reasons might course people become better hygiene wearing mask. Tomorrow Never Dies = economy totally ruined

we lockdown. cant afford another. alot coming him. saying. think people doubt COVID doubting severity virus it’s existence.  Hopefully teachers protected, people intibating COVID patients protected way protect teachers. Plexiglass, PPE, proper ventilation. Idk whole thing mind fuck This. places separate economy things apparently precious cost normal places. Prison commissaries, airports, gas stations, cruise ships category me. Mostly 'captive audience' (literally case prisons) problem, though gas station convenient factor. call convenience stores. Lives livelihood. People can’t work they’re sick dead. People can’t work they’re home caring elderly family sick dying covid. 

Also, very, clearly stated UBI answer no, I’d rather sacrifice anyone’s livelihood, comes choosing two there’s question I’d choose. like 3 months ago tons people didnt think worked all... heck people still around. Vaccine adaptation technologies mature strain H1N1, flu joke. President Obama criticized ""overreaction"" handling 2009 H1N1. saw outcome. Better safe sorry. staying home state capital, businesses bragging open lobbies eat packed people wearing masks almost back peak numbers already. Someone living doesn’t interact anyone regular basis, going spread old person bringing home. would selfish live old folks could get it, everyone situation people don’t feel forced stop things there’s virtually risk anyone around risk CDC job stop it. last 6 months? What’s gonna excuse outbreak happens convention look like dicks are? Also, thought. know CFR poor metric midst pandemic/epidemics, many factors like test capacity, testing guidelines, etc.

I truly hope death curve spikes less comparatively NYC overwhelmed systems huge factor. &lt;3 entirely trusting, would never entirely trust ccp, would stupid. live China know going here. opposed someone I'm guessing never anywhere near China blindly follows Western propoganda place. Yeah that's big fear. good news IMO dollar probably retain status like fiscal monetary policies countries necessarily better. 

But dollar gets supplanted Euro something... even want think might happen might encourage US think reforming society. proud governor. He's getting much shit, continuously right thing. Dropping picking schools going nightmare. usually beg anyone let kids ride bus. line horrendous afternoon blocks whole street best times. Maybe staggered start times drop-offs?

600 elementary kids getting picked dropped logistical nightmare. It’s click bait article click bait title. don’t care facts. Reddit always get shit bad people look comments help someone understand something. nice see.

And sir, please send us 10 bitcoin time services, thank you. /s Tested last Wednesday, results Saturday. Drive 50 miles Oxnard though! I've really enjoyed sleeping pandemic. news good news.  I'm American, trust US world leader also collapsed. enough words vocabulary describe piece shit. wart society’s ass. Yup smaller, new colleges absolutely survival situation.

But state universities big name universities purely greed. They’ve got pockets weather this! regularly go rich people's homes part job. always wear mask. 50 homes entered one house decided too.

Some try maintain social distancing, others can't seem see dancing backwards away them.

It interesting. one house said worry mask. said wore others. used it. preference get others sick. said ""thanks"" reciprocation? life.

I bet people go restaurant staff mask. care staff. care me. mask another thing servants do. control. it. others them, like everything else.

The virus care. wish everyone would wear mask. (and yes mask help protect too. magic bullet.) Imagine FL matched 9.5k. week interesting big daily milestones broken. 50k day seems bigger deal 40 45. least fear mongering headlines.

I finally train waiting weeks draw conclusions rise cases without rise death yet. Steroids cure though, alleviate symptoms virus still there. 

What really wish could know percent people symptoms vs tested without any...if numbers symptomatic people worried live North OC predominantly Latino neighborhood. mostly wearing masks mostly see acting guidelines. restrictions lifted big family parties started back up. live Nebraska governor Ricketts [literally withholding Covid-19 relief counties require masks. expects able everything open July 31, [testing per city, makes sense cases decline, really? wonder that's still accurate. know users apps like RobinHood way since Corona started. I'll bite. (Your posts intelligent see saying.) experiments would like see run? ethical pragmatic lines running experiments deadly, transmissable disease? death numbers started spiking longer 4 days ago. dummies gonna end wrong change narrative something else. Calling now. evidence countries. Italy Spain basically 100% back normal without spikes. Daily case average per week never dipped 25k deaths continue drop despite this. Why? answer everyone ignores obvious trend. time prove wrong. Remind week. Maybe tiny spike cases 1 week average deaths hit 1k I'll take anyone's bet holds true July I'm glad Cuomo looking it, good NY, attitudes towards Covid upstate rural NY alot trickier. Cuomo consider moron parts. Like gift pair socks. I'll take think shitty gift. Good choice. regret it. Totally topic. But, thought ""snoovatar"" bug screen. fuck up. People still complained first half assed shutdown actually started work moment hit decline back business usual. Uber isn’t shut anywhere knowledge. would insane. LOL, look numbers 2-3 weeks... Non violent offenders released house arrest, yes. miss Netflix 360 back day. Surprised streaming services haven’t something like this. Sure, die revert ""Harmless."" fly US?  That's fucking asked, eradicate covid, ever read monetary donations vaccine research. wanted else get fucking downvoted it. 4 months prepare. fucked can’t create indoor crowd outdoor crowd existed? Neither exist time like this. lot people getting mad likely don’t work begin don’t understand body weight workouts don’t much anything all. cared enough steal PPE that's it. Absolutely fuck not! would go school year period. 

I couldn’t give less shit Stanford, lot small colleges real trouble students don’t come back, they’re making really bad safety decisions. protests started couple weeks ago, 100% behind them, completely surprising Corona numbers risen two weeks later. beg differ. 

-From Philippines Italy? saw italian military quarantined bulgarian farmworkers south mean, technically speaking logistically possible, countries started reopening schools.

Realistically speaking, chance working well US. Signs different symptoms. 

Signs seen doctor symptoms felt reported patient.

The damage seen CT scans noticed patients. adolescent suicides risen started within four weeks shut down. It’s hard pick side. there’s kids won’t die stuck terrible people home. preparing deal lot trauma school reopens back school usual  support everything staying closed essential living disease passes. Loss income covered government funding, mortgage penalties evictions suspended, utilities heavily discounted. 

We beyond recession economically while, come back. Loved ones can't. know people support approach, believe fully. choose whatever like, ask everyone remember without health people love (yet), nationally, even two week lag, death rates continuing go deviate increased number cases (both reported estimated). I'm kind doctor, strong interpretation this. 1. It’s Morgantown, liberal place WV probably active/young people filled place WV.
2. HAHA WV joke! original funny! Nobody’s ever heard joke demeaning West Virginia! fear beginning incompetence would exacerbate existing problems end *creating* problem exist, way mixture both. create virus, fail maintain existing pandemic response team, failed leader point entire executive branch bumbled initial response, mention politicizing issue point supporters even defend families disease... Basically, exacerbated problem point resurgence inevitable, functionally means created new problem - like old one, except screaming supermarket Karens. assuming EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, etc lying? I'm currently jury duty. cases postponed months, county 20 confirmed covid cases. I’m Central IL it’s relief hear that. see people wearing masks but, admittedly, haven’t really many places. R senators really need start throwing president bus That's bit cop out. New Zealand followed course action countries could quite easily 100's thousands cases. actually decided put bit effort thier response. Hard drink 15 beers mask absolutely agree. Looking plots new cases California, seems obvious lockdown never quite effective needed needed something else.  Happy birthday. &lt;3 county's outbreak farmworker housing. :( think open borders citizens / people countries can't seem handle it. Heh, guy understand happens dollar lose status...

Here's thing, there's thing US declining #2 economy, either #1 able support USD, lose support go freefall. Like things completely depend investor confidence, e.g. ponzi schemes, there's thing graceful exit. either intact, collapses.

This also US everything, unimaginable things, prevent losing #1 position belief solvency comes it. Trump symptom trend certainly accelerated it, trend continue long he's gone. summer, yes. tried pulling bootstraps?  anti-mask crowd far right, discount size ""I really care and/or ignorant"" crowd well. There's also vain ones. It'll hard get full compliance, mean, even getting another sub-section population board definitely win. Yes, 8 weeks incubation. Oh good thing thousands protesting multiple funerals one criminal Death: I'll back. (aronld voice) look thick Asian girl chill out. point lock 2 weeks people stay house we’re done I’d say outside risk low. allows others cover. “Oh, protests riots ok guess go birthday party.” That’s really hurt us protests. Yup, good ones already shut *voluntarily* anyway. aren’t ones joining lawsuit Texas changed anything past 48 hours aside bars/rafting closing? Dallas don’t think there’s change I'm preparing Fall. way things going think going bad here. serious right now? article post about. March huge crisis NYC. crisis southern states. So, correct, really changed location. yes, resources scarce. literally crisis care protocol referenced article. hospitals space resources treat patients use amounts wartime triage. Antibodies created horses used similarly
to plasma recovered COVID patients. It’s like vaccine doesn’t cause patients immune system acquire immunity virus. 

(It doesn’t hurt horse.)

Does make sense? Funny. feel lack articles science protest risk (outdoors, many masked) vs socializing risk (few masked, indoor activity) see write off. protests fading away confront /discuss risk lifestyle beyond protests. don’t care blames unfair. want focus problem risks. That’s big picture book. count “required” aren’t gonna warned, fined, arrested it?  going begin without homework risk vs benefits doctors oeave you.

Effexor one worst offenders. mask protecting filter side mask. Florida seen surge cases past weeks. accompanying surge deaths occur? 

Same lot US states. Thank goodness. Putin Europe finally cozy without noisy America (and UK) room. U make great point. hope one day u run successful business. U seem really passionate BOH great thing. Nobody forgot, needed followed actual plan. Asian countries single digit cases per day effectively contact traced, quarantined, wore masks. would Americans pay attention Hong Kong right Americans hear presidente belittle reporters wearing masks?

Buy Fox News. End rampant disinformation. Since continue nothing them, constantly pretending surprised people don’t believe science, assume faking concern.

Sincerely,

Me, guy internet could told shit going worse expecting long, long time ago. Think ""If act now, naught""

naught = nothing = zero. certainly appreciate sentiment, heroes. Honestly, jobs didn’t another choice. country hospital systems let us completely. tools keep safe, let alone begin jobs properly. sent inappropriate PPE, paid (as resident) less minimum wage risk lives risk bringing home families. mention psychological stress. honest, weren’t many hundreds thousands dollars debt career refuse work conditions (you quit pandemic? Good luck getting job medicine ever again), none us would done it. nothing glamorous heroic it. horrific. horrific every way. Hospitals already capacity ethics board put place decide prioritized receiving treatment. read another article. everyone qualifies. 44% denied one reason another. Thank work tremendous care others. Medical personnel front line since thing started.  Lulz, North America : Canada, U.S.A.

No shit. Look turn tables. Guess assumptions wrong.  Thanks, Karen's. Oh I'm assuming neither. I'm saying, take genius figure right moves would best country, united everyone behind common threat, election. saw template Dubya. absolute shit job, economy's dumpster, we're 2 wars based complete lies administration, yet wins second term. Parents continue summer break. set. I'd hope quite bad, since know virus, risk, possible treatments, etc. might first smart thing I've heard Mitch say. said 3 months ago. number cases gets certain point, containing it. 

Back started, seemed like 1000 cases number areas. number crossed, exponential rise started.

It foolish give guidelines 385 million people expect followed. destroyed economy staggering number cases. Worst worlds. Clearly never Tucson [Rodeo](http://tucsonrodeo.com/). TUSD Sunnyside School district (all Tucson) rodeo off. Sunnyside (in particular) Good Friday (alongside schools) also no-contract day Easter Monday, TUSD school. primarily due continual low attendance Easter Monday Sunnyside importance Easter Tohono O'odham community well heavily Roman Catholic Latino community South Tucson rest south Tucson.

It sounds racist ignorant head, recognition importance district's cultural makeup - redlining institutional racism cities' history. yes....what sucks ppl forced stay making money cause really need health insurance personal reasons. course. nicest, genuine, smart hard working bartender cant make normal 25 hour salary, cause stay necessity healthcare. 

I'm 100% healthy moment sacrifice it. man. sucks. america u need $$$$ insurance really think that’s reason people upset economic lockdowns, really detached reality. 

People upset they’re facing losses livelihoods, careers, businesses, houses, children’s futures, etc. minimal assistance. Restrictions potentially still necessary, don’t act like people aren’t justified upset. Like... unemployment insurance $600 weekly kicker feds? 93 realistically people much better chance survive. Religion killing masses lock down. also trace isolate, quarantining may exposed facility rather telling quarantine home they'll infect families. Pandering prospect voters Even box? India Russia also pretty bad. fuckin stupid. nothing covid dumb cooze Lovely  mother, anthropoids, cephalopods, cacti, etc Know customers Cash, yes. services? Literally government scientists helped create it. used government facilities government grants universities helped fund research.

The citizens USA continue fund life saving research pay ass corporate execs afford fifteenth boat. family home shore past 2 weeks. drive back Philadelphia took nearly 2 hours without accidents. like pandemic even thing anymore. things matter without enforcement. failure one man- country whole actually ability face challenge.

I knew generation wouldn’t able storm beaches Normandy. we’re asked that. wear mask slightly inconvenience social life. It’s fucking embarrassing.  authors reported significant excess deaths age groups, excess mortality observed older age groups closer official reported numbers deaths caused SARS-CoV-2 infection. 

For example:   80+ years old group excess deaths 986 (95% CI 497-1,529) 

This means 986 80+ year-olds died 2020 compared historical averages - assumption excess due COVID-19  I'm sorry hear that. least give grandmother treatment plan? doing? Agreed it. extended bullshit safe return order 6th, like that's going anything. Well got sad real damn fast  Governor Newsom great job closing California quick. Unfortunately seems fallen economic/outside pressures reopening. Want see aggressive mentality saw March! area around S4 labs locked two weeks Oct. 2019, proven mobile phone data? Check date range outbreak report... genes. better mathematics education. 

It's native language, actually. reason Chinese Russians stereotypically good math language internal monologue in. You’re absolutely right. Without giving much detail, I’m friendly guy owns bar.. state said closed restaurants able open. bought hotdog machine, got certified restaurant, opening coming days. owns multiple apartment complexes doesn’t need money. He’s mid 60’s regulars 60+. 

I don’t wish ill anyone but...  [COVID-19 Outbreak Associated Air Conditioning Restaurant, Guangzhou, China, Hey kid, pretty sure better yet, swear peace officers start beating macing people getting mad masks bruh  I'm Calgary Stampede year. HUGE rodeo, huge bucks city. Sorry friend. many needlessly dying. Yeah well there’s lot things federal government “should” doing... Healthcare worker here.

Our ICUs full almost every patient COVID positive COVID rule (meaning, suspicious it, confirmed yet).

It's really bad. nothing else, COVID sure showed us selfish be. amount of, “f*ck you, I’ve got mine,” attitude world. Funny thing true worked Japan. constitution forbids government implementing laws enforces use masks self-quarantine. simply entered ""state emergency"" advised people do. Yet everyone part and, month so, state emergency.

Sometimes, really people mindset. Hopefully local community pull together make program inclusive. happened city, provided 2 meals per day every child, whether qualified not. truly feel school aged kids teachers. socialization learning. school districts setup effectively teach children remotely. I'm opinion gyms, bars dine needs stopped. problem young people tend live parents. give stimulus cheques support instead giving everyone flush it, flaunt referring idiot patrons follow rules, idiot bar owners allowed happen?  least we’re last something once!  work much.... This, it’s unusual media likes whip scare stories Wait wait.
So places still open!? actual f? 
People actually still going movies bars gyms right now!? Well sure explains lot. Lol think every old person, underlying health conditions, immunocompromised money time stay home day? open economy millions Americans returning work, risk developing serious case. People work make money don’t luxury sit around home.

Besides think vulnerable people live multiple people. housemates/family could infect them, even they’re staying home. good news increase 7-day rolling average new cases less today yesterday 1890 vs 2063. acceleration new cases may slowing, bad news got long way slow number stabilizes lot longer get scary number. dimwits claim want everything opened back unwilling needs done make reality. Wear mask, social distance, wash hands. get open back up. earth friggin hard understand?! China hk would fine jail ppl. repercussions actions lol live 20 minties D'Jais Belmar confirm place PACKED 2 weeks ago. say packed, literally mean many people stand shoulder shoulder. Even wanted ""social distance"" utterly impossible. got liquor license taken away though, that's plus! Go home Bennys!!! That’s pathetic. law enforcement shut even chance something stupid get Wall Shame. regulation hold people responsible, mean something serious, instead using Wall Shame punish them. heard wise man say alcohol *cause of* *solution to* life's problems. Seems like millenials know well went engineering computer science alot financial assistance family. everyone else idea ever owning house financially secure dream. phase 3 ? Depends properly fit. decent seal see mask get sucked inhalation. significant part breathing bypassing mask, would get that. That's part fit test N95 masks well. 

Source: Used fit tests masks construction. Same. anyone surprised? virus highly contagious. Germany good job contained. don’t think you’re understanding I’m saying, opinion Sun revolves around Earth doesn’t mean it’s true. Investing stocks normal part retirement portfolio. age retired nothing stocks. say stocks option retire absolutely shouldn’t be. Investing stocks ≠ gambling diversified. fact opinion. space fair amount people 8 fat ceilings - bueno. Twenty foot ceilings proper spacing - much better.

Part reason harder catch outside ceiling 100s miles high people cough sneeze, virus particles disperse air. yes 20' high ceilings would definitely help, fresh air circulating building would also help significantly. Yeah billions diverted defense industry stupid fckn wall.Can't believe workers left deal own.We've deserted leadership.  think mom much it. know English first language, worded question weird way got us confused that's read POC allowed wear masks get anxiety masked black man likely get shot police........ Yeaaaaa

And I'm like, super BLM police reform even statues, sure, whatever, maybe leave Lincoln alone traitors... ""Oh can't wear mask pandemic I'm black police may think I'm criminal mask target."" Like c'mon, no, everyone wearing masks right (well... everyone be), going target every singe African American stopping Wal Mart something. Haha family told this.. I’m laughing hard rn  hospitals near full they're putting beds atriums.  Nixon also took us gold standard (allowing inflation income inequality flourish) passed HMO act kickstarted healthcare nightmare. Lets reflect....

You stated ""you idiot think hospitals getting paid put people hospitals"" 

I pointed yes theyre incentived admit people proved wrong. went tirade insults overall childish behavior wordy boring diatribe. Generally happens thin skinned know-it-all(you) proven wrong. San Bernardino uh yeah need help too. Certainly depends guess. 

Like wouldn’t live Canada paid me... suppose lived Detroit wouldn’t bad idea. Oh hey. Internet Explorer finally finished loading common sense. Yes, unfortunately NY too. people coded, often couldn’t even try resuscitate them. didn’t PPE safely, chances surviving low deemed “not worth it” (as HORRIBLE know sounds). Basically everyone Covid automatic dni/dnr result, whether wanted not. literally makes nauseous think treat people. Haha. Please research.

1. We've 2 big anti lockdown protests.
2. Nobody wears mask dont need too(masks dont work, says dutch CDC) First Indochina War, ended 1945, Japan actually, since Japan kicked France WW2. France said hi again, lost 1956, mostly known First Indochina War, actually second. US like turn. US got kicked 1973, South Vietnam 1975. 1979 China - Cambodia vs Vietnam related Indochina war pretty good wearing masks distancing awhile, go grocery shopping looks like people without masks tons people standing close person front waiting line. 

 People seemed gone ""Hey, opening things back up! means now! need wear mask anymore."" No, over. still need wear masks keep distance people out. I'm worried cases going start going lot we'll go back lockdown. selfish people want wear masks. America’s. looks like several hotspots going ICU beds. 
I think tried build capacity saw Italy New York.

Just hope major accidents happening. actually checked see much budget spent healthcare actually 11% overstate numbers. half that. time government pay dental eye care health care related things like ambulances. Well touche. guess clarify meant ""It depends mean; depending trying accomplish thing shitty filters"" point taken. got little rant crazy top.

My point trying to(albeit badly) say ""If goal say reduce amount saw dust 10%; filter using achieves that; success shitty filter""; generic cotton masks offer much protection(IIRC 15-40% depending thickness/layers; thinnest 15%) call shitty filter goal gain protection. still seem loop... Even feasible, people staff it.

Also, ""all good"" yesterday. last week either. abundance ineptitude leadership currently. Crowd looks like types people argue retail workers mask policies Pro tip millenials Gen Zers. kids That's exactly mean, 975,000 number reference to? EMAIL comes virus??? lol it’s coming y’all *pretends shocked * Canada I’m guessing due bureaucracy, nurses aren’t allowed buy right? 🤣 Question: triage deaths count COVID deaths? 

Because absolutely fucking should. fucking unacceptable state United States get point everything people try slow down. 

Every last one triage deaths needs counted COVID reckless people see amount death brought selfishness carelessness. get care 70 bad stroke. Youre COVID COVID related death. number can't swept rug. People need see real price behavior filing hospitals capacity. Sometimes herd gracious enough thin themselves. It’s secret-the US began circling drain 1980s. Yeah, we’re thrilled stay type events, would imagine event draws crowd &amp; especially indoors shut USA worldwide. places tried opening nightclubs outbreaks quickly. may looking concert-free world get vaccine. I'm disappointed everyone else (was really looking forwards last years State Trance 1000 next winter) aware we're kinda boat &amp; can't take risks virus there. There's always future look forwards to, get control. 2nd wave, 3rd wave 4th wave vaccine developed every human planet infected. Grew Fontucky , lots former highschool friends ( even work medical ) considered Coronavirus overblown , hoax, early posts scientific journals labs panicky reactionary .  


This least pleasant told I've experienced life . even worth circling back . think word means think means. Unless course tens thousands voters claim arena home address, case, means, carry on.

I live 1060 W. Addison Chicago myself. Easiest way demand King’s ransom King’s life stake  district sent email today pretty much stating unless there's state mandate time school opens fall semester, taking measures ""feasible."" Unlike districts around us, plan modified schedules, mention even online option. felt okay letting kids attend summer school would fewer students said would temperature checks, social distancing, masks would worn...but pictures posted social media showed 0 masks (teachers included) everyone huddled together. Fall going shit show I'm crossing fingers come sort plan. maskless antilockdown protests. claiming information regarding influenza strains never newsworthy COVID-19...and rolling eyes me? Sure thing, bud.

Pretty sure humans given giant collective shit influenza strains since...oh...I know...1918 shit. reminds years ago: bar bunch students world communicating broken English - problem understanding other. Native English speakers? totally lost. hilarious. Hard explain away New York, Illinois Minnesota though... indoor businesses predominantly. certain people got COVID protests, think main factor here. issue article brings little AC itself, fact close windows conserve energy AC units cut fresh air flow outside, regardless system use, without fresh air likely catch coronavirus.

I think office buildings allowed open things like install UV sterilizing lights ducts, use energy recovering ventilators bring fresh outdoor air office environments, businesses use efficient air filters changed frequently.  Schools Arizona also moved back starting date August 17th. Really curious next school year gonna go. stealing masks monopolizing vaccines, French hating American government guts now. EU list countries okay enter countries banned still less 2000 day 2 months ago. handling well either. great compared crazily high numbers west. testing actively since start, however fortunately main populance totslly fine masks, willing wear one. like reddit still ""it mainly protect others"" debate going here. Yes, think CDC deserves lot blame. delayed testing, said masks need worn healthy people nursing home policy. nice much us. try avoid shopping whenever possible. Perhaps strap boots? Instructions unclear. Excerpt article since looks like people might get wrong message headline:

""WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s frequent Trump administration talking point recent spike COVID-19 infections: Don’t worry, small sliver U.S. counties greater risk. 

In offering reassurance, Vice President Mike Pence Health Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said 3% 4% counties country seeing surge cases. Focus “encouraging signs,"" Pence told senators last week. 

But administration officials skirting key fact: 20% Americans live relatively counties.""
 

The article trying say ""dont worry, 20% Americans live hot spots."" saying ""wake fuck 20% Americans concentrated current hot spots.""  think also shown much labour rights eroded. paid sick, maternity annual leave law, rights fired. seem like good place employee. Lol, idea agreement felt hostile saying thing different way. I'm glad got :P understand may understand ""Internet sovereignty"" means.
Why Europe imposing restrictions US internet companies?
Guess why. Time Machine real. True. However, example citing, triage decisions made ED: far many people would come whether treat left people decide.
Eta: still, thank clarifying that. course need reduce consumption animal products. everyone decides eat meat day instead 3 times day, would help lot terms environment diseases... goes Crystal. Texas hasn’t done now, doubt ever will. robust contact tracing. think NY one implemented huge system that. poor Twitter.. worst ~~robo~~ humanity responding tweets. Although see handled homeless. city sidewalks downtown Portland. required shelter place took city. fucked. Looks like 3rd world country west side sophisticated medical system 

I assume meant tech. also sophisticated (and haphazard) medical bureaucracy, definitely help situation.

Also, medicine world renown, woefully underfunded public health systems exactly would've helped us crisis. Imagine strong public health system able distribute masks every American extol unequivocally benefits mask wearing within days first US case. Imagine well-developed track, test, trace, isolate strategies place Day 1.

Good medicine cures sick individuals. Good public health prevents first place. literally donated billions charitable causes

Which charitable causes these? Also, track donations actually beneficial...? gets warm tho way it. Masks EVERYWHERE! exceptions! fine print interpreted different way. EVERYWHERE!

If federal govt slightest bit get top horrendous pandemic, mask wearing would required like nationwide, exceptions, oh hell naw another political football divide conquer America! hope actually pay guy. fact know correct infuriating... means Bill Gates dumber thought ever faith American people! heard mexico news while, didn’t go full China start fucking numbers anyway ? hard humanity need hit stick

this proof muricans 'humanity' Tri-state area general top (Murphy, Cuomo, Lamont remaining fully coordinated this) despite one earliest places US get hit. Steroids less reliance intubation showing huge improvements recovery rates Ok, made mistake bringing New York. 

Put way: Cedar Rapids Iowa basic temperature right Tampa, Florida, cooler Albuquerque, NM. people places pumping AC. South (assumed Southeast) AC different Midwest Southwest? AC July spreading central heat early March?

I get - air circulates, air moving confined spaces means greater risk infection. That’s gist story. think threw “AC South” bit weak claim. County Public Health Officer seems like care. actively anti-mask entire time. Dr. Penny Borenstein.  mistake. calculated move protect supply medical workers. Even then, simply enough. dire supply issues resolved April/May, even then, sporadically.

When supply better able accommodate, everyone changed messaging changing situation. US failed so. lot corporate measures security theater absolve responsibility case outbreak happens watch Smart move. would forced fire everyone otherwise whole operation would shut down.

Oh, live world ppl trust docs instead podcasters. 

Check sovereign citizen here. ;) Lol. 

Bush claimed Mission Accomplished 17 years ago war that’s still ongoing. 

This becoming trend. Many dont care still think virus fake ( less leaa everyday hope) , *at least* mask use politized stigmatized US. Wait, water parks open? Water parks? kidding me??? Please, Houston Mayor good people. someone lives Arizona, would field hospitals even work here? imagine horror field hospitals consisting tents trying treat patients 110° heat. Lockdown within 48 hours sure Patchouli would definitely work keep away, mask mask. Ye gods. lavender blech.

Personally, I'm going horseradish onions, massive amounts garlic. Read article next “We seen spikes states driven, part, return patrons indoor dining establishments, seated, without face coverings, significant periods time,” said. “We also moved take step seen establishments across state Murphy added: “Overcrowding. complete disregard social distancing. few, any, face coverings.” Spain, double population Florida, maxed 9000 per day, 3 weeks one strictest lockdowns world. ... climate emergency enters chat He's wrong. Oregon certain powers pandemic extend around 60 days constitution specify required ppe ""law."" OSHA already confirmed covid-19 ppe rules suggestions, law. read website. ELI5: hard determine? seems new article every day saying is/isn't immunity collecting disease.

Is Covid thing, usually hard determine ones immunity viruses/diseases well? Meanwhile chillin Nova Scotia 20 days free covid That's happens people elect people believe magic real lol months. PPE issues addressed? Best way control take bars licence away 4 weeks, think better manage responsibilities DEFCON 5. need catch once, dont breath people's mouths It’s literally article bothered reading “We seen spikes states driven, part, return patrons indoor dining establishments, seated, without face coverings, significant periods time,” said. “We also moved take step seen establishments across state Murphy added: “Overcrowding. complete disregard social distancing. few, any, face coverings.” China asks so, right refuse UBI would better solution though, no? bit chubby active otherwise healthy. ): US still wealthy hell sure.

Yet bizarre symptoms dysfunction, almost exclusively insane partisanship.

Our political system tried solve hard problem in, oh... Well, since deal Soviet Union. 1990 so, US government made everything touches worse. Arizona does, however, report hospitalization, overall bed availability, ICU capacity, statistics. dashboard A1, S+. watch state go hell handbasket accurately!

Daily hospitalization rates almost doubled mid-May (~37/day average 5/21) early-June (70/day 6/7). seems may trending little could delayed reporting hospitals turning away people would admitted they're full - that's drawback tracking via hospitalization, become overwhelmed, stop admitting serious cases, looks like numbers go down.

(deaths 75% late-May low. People say ""oh really increased"" have, numbers low moment) Age groups getting infected. CDC data showing new cases younger (and thus healthier)

They’re much better job protecting vulnerable groups (nursing homes) start. 

For example jurisdiction North America extremely well BC, right away implemented strict visitor rules care homes banned nurses PCWs working multiple sites, compare Canadian counterparts Ontario Quebec took measures much late, near super majority deaths = care homes pts. 

It’s reason SK’s numbers good, pandemic hit church younger age cohort allowed recognize implement pandemic response measures. 

Singapore well, outbreak within migrant worker dorms rather population large. Low death rate due vary nature labourers “fit” younger.

Most countries well established nursing home forms care seen deaths among population.

I can’t speak Brazil though. Deaths lag 2-3 weeks. peaks usually occur 3 weeks shutdown. guess won’t fully shutdown deaths really start rack that’s another 1-2 weeks now. means won’t see peak another 4-5 weeks. lot states, means least another month massive, exponential growth. 

I’m epidemiologist schooled statistician, understanding I’ve read far. American refugee looking asylum.

Pls let in. lock room 14 days. I‘ve also told make good pancakes I’ll make everyone let quarantine.

Pls. Pretty pls don't. want team win. That's we're fucked. No. not. Players staff get infected crowds crowds. live bubble even bubble NBA trying include staff hotels, yet another infection point. pretty much ID2020 is? Even microchip, substance injected you, used identify vaccination history potential health records. hard understand (unless willfully obtuse) turned conspiracy. Thank this. wrong, thanks irresponsible/misreading stuff. understand. What's wrong people? people need see convince virus serious? Fucking hell. started getting back gym again. day two face mask rule getting dropped recommendation, state wide order going effect Censorship finest. Trimet said drivers enforce mask rule mixed stuff read, wrong. think asking sources makes dick, fwiw. mean it'll slow it, entirely work. gotta close everything flatten curve. Otherwise gonna keep opening closing opening closing like roller coaster. Lots people get sick die lose way money way. scroll sub chronologically like three posts perfect example. 

In one town (Alabama?) many deaths aren’t enough tests. people buried without determining COVID cause death. 

That least one mechanism numbers off. Newton chock FULL idiots throwing temper tantrums even suggestion wear masks. 15 cases total first 6 weeks.  We've increased 20 last 10 days. it’s worth, live Illinois there’s least places opened outdoor spaces recently couple weeks ago It’s enough “not racist”. willing hold others accountable actions to. anti-racist. Really, learn get COVID. side people who've exposed seem intense symptoms, would make sense. virus system without effort time virus harder fight off. Plus work 1/2 away trump rally BOK center tulsa. Devil's advocate: probably correct New Zealand used example large white population. Asian countries big problems compliance, mask-wearing already societal norm. However, many predominantly white nations (e.g. Sweden) decided take different approach many countries history mask-wearing social distancing. words, like, ""Hey, white dudes it, can't we? Stop uncooperative."" Multnomah county already started Wednesday (Portland). Still plenty people refusing wear mask Loot bar mean. definitely factor AZ. 100+ everyday Phoenix, noone spend much time outside kind heat. Yup. Googling + Reddit + Benadryl bad idea. Thanks! ever get tired saying wait two weeks? level 0 techs something? teach Reddit take Benadryl. Thanks correction! funny momevment calls ""liberal"" free implying freedom freedom speech ultimately want silence everyone agreeing opinions. 1984-ish. 

Just clear: censorship mean one agrees people censored saying. principle free-speech freedom, know, main concept constitution whole liberal-leftist movement shitting on. Honestly, don’t think bars gums open long enough us see true consequences. It’s going get worse. Exactly happened UK 3 months ago. US chose draw lessons rest world. already worst hit country world getting worse. Honestly, given data things like church choirs (that one Washington early 2/3 attendees single rehearsal got virus), I'd say lot performing arts worse gyms.

As someone classically trained singing, well aware *absolutely fantastic* way produce aerosolized droplets. able project one's voice means able project sound waves. instrumental ensemble outside string orchestras likely bad. like wind instruments spit valves anything... Pence finally stuttering mask bad idea.

It's little late, \*something\*. Serious question, California worried wildfires again? looked pretty bad.. last year Trump army morons decided die Mask Hill. Good riddance. hope don’t take bunch innocent people them. I've calling sub psychotic reactionaries [over 100 days straight.](http://www.reddit.com/r/coronavirusvirus) never stops.

When said done think coronavirus remembered first case Global Hysteria.

Thanks, internet. Thanks, kind figured like that. someone tested positive mild symptoms absolutely nothing except thier conscience making isolate themselves. That's kinda scary. Depends where. I'm Bellevue (nearly Issaquah) fine. Certainly local store fine, go hill Newcastle 90%. Found place city charging 850 one bedroom , everywhere else climbing 1100 range , insane Deaths lagging indicator. 

People freaking leading indicators steep curve right. 

Deaths follow. 

If hospitals get overwhelmed, death rate spike well.

The certainties. 

People freaking many people pay attention lagging indicator things fine see clearly heading for.  president crazy appears news? Kind shocked got power fact depressing one realized back February. hope saving planet CO2 buildup cause global warming best not. [More testing found surgical masks block 75% respiratory-droplet-size particles. genuinely don’t understand masks big deal. It’s mind boggling. It’s so, fucking East. smallest inconvenience could think of. like pandemics new thing. company work for? Shocked would even allowing People who’ve never worked single day entire lives first ones tell go gym. Finally, Mississippi #1 something. mayor fucking idiot plus opened barbershops bars too. like getting max HP dropped everytime get it. already pandemic.

There's signs Arizona outside places saying masks required, yet people walk without wearing nobody enforces it. sheriff town even made statement saying even though city requires masks, sending anyone anything calls made regarding someone wearing mask. outside long, everything feels hopeless... Thank you! Yeah dudes gonna really bad time get COVID. good job

If dying cancer doctor told drug cost $5, side effects, proven 50% likelihood saving life, would turn 100%? *Masks 100% effective worthwhile*. Even cheesiest homemade masks porous bedsheet cloth like 10% effective, medical masks multilayered cloth masks much, much higher that. 10-50% reduced chance death no-brainer even debate, especially given pathetically minimal effort required wear mask crowded social situations. literally zero penalty downside person wearing mask. think America ""shithole"" need travel more. Shut fuck

There's long way peak. Always bet Florida man, 2/1 odds he's sure thing. California shown make good decisions times. ran ventilators too, certain hospitals. Seems every new virus originates China. Media scientists keep telling us aren’t man made, coincidence. another one?!! Come man. Ok thanks clarification, graphs make look like within grey area expected deaths could scale probably right. I'm musician who's cancel entire year touring; 100% income. I'm fucked :) keep outside everyone wear mask. literal thousands protesters congregate everyday, problem. Fully geared ICUs literally tell doctor nurse PA everyone ended scrawling other's backs sharpies. That's right. I've saying along too. build million beds, healthcare workers left look you, matter one bit. assholes caaaan't wear mask selfish pieces shit world. still took century Rome fall, least western half Roman Empire. 

If you’re thinking sudden collapse sort you’re wrong 

Reality much boring it’s gonna slow decline down, problems start showing build slowly it’s noticeable it’s descent downwards. 

And nations won’t collapse coronavirus, sure hell major economic damage health issues won’t fall like house cards don’t think hospitals profiting much, especially cover much overhead costs like labor insurance reimbursement cover x amount. suspecting nurses averaging 12-16 hr days pandemic. make average new nurse makes $30/hr x 8 hr shift + time &amp; half 4 hrs + double time kicks 13th hour x # days worked add rather quick. Mind Charge Nurses make $50-60 / hr + Directors make even more. Let’s add fact hospital x amt nurses per bed per day. 

Physicians get paid on-call hours well rotations make $250+hr 

Needless say wouldn’t surprised hospitals go bankrupt following Noooo Dune D: H1N1 came 2008 it? took while!   Wut ""Further, coronavirus particularly vicious virus, say even though death rate may rising relative number new cases, coronavirus survivors may still experience impaired lung function problems future.""

Nothing new here, finally seeing reporting mentions ""you might die, fuck up!"" before. reported, seems louder drumbeat now. Same. Logan everyone seems masked minding business. Ya is. worded better lazy. probably outdoor concert. audience wear mask like protesters. Economy pre-Covid pretty damn stellar

Umm, no. massive systemic issues, store closures bankruptcies growing rates, volatile stock market throwing fits anytime Fed withdrew QE support tried raise interest rates. mention stagnant wages massive debt across board. thing ""stellar"" pre-pandemic economy unemployment rate, hugely manipulated number actually reflect real state employment. Oh, wealth kleptocracy... that's given system. America: Hold AK-47 opponents believe voting though. low turnout US amazing me. Yet masks ego political issue many. knew amount stupid people America? People think wearing mask protects others. recognize effective everyone wearing mask. Go picnic food blankets. Go hikes Right, Wuhan saying R0 4-6. know R0 variable depending circumstances. models wrong, really take behavioural changes. would say saying R0 high wuhan hardly underplaying it.  Winter coming. We'll find soon enough what's Africa. find hard discuss sexual tension Grandma yourself? cells memory cells. remember fight certain diseases. might turn COVID mild cold people already cell immunity. methodology flawed - discussed lot - likely underestimate R great bit - good watch trends, necessarily accurate. Extra capacity can’t put place rapidly beyond point. There’s many doctors. 

All countries plan place prevent excess cases. sure surprises anyone considering almost half country voted complete crazy idiot. know people voted idiot also resist logic. ""pay too"", yeah pay taxes everyone get medical care free, think Australia pays ludicrous premium America things like Insulin? government cops 540 dollars per vial chin American would to, somehow procure less 30 dollars (mostly free script) pharmacies, government absorb 500 dollars us cause they're nice? 

This annoying thing American. bunch foreigners idea they're talking bitching healthcare system.

Almost American paying 540 per vial insulin. Poor Americans covered Medicaid states, Americans covered private insurance, old Americans covered medicare. roommate diabetic able pay rent paying 540 vial insulin(doesn't actually come vials, w/e)

The insurance companies paying 540 per vial insulin either. price pay, sticker price private information negotiated insurance companies prescription group. 

For drugs Americans pay similar price per molecule countries like Germany Japan, simply consume preference name brand expensive, gouge poor vulnerable people like. Cost literally 4 cents per pill make? Wow, better inflate price 12,000%

What last time Australian drug company made anything noteworthy? actually FDA trials, yes need pay up. Americans mythical ""really good insurance"", bet they've still paid pocket costs regular run mill stuff lifetime uninsured Australian.

Sure paid way taxes. I've lived Australia, amount paying taxes, could pay best health insurance states more.

Your vomit post reminds quote wise man said: 


**Australia lucky country run mainly second rate people share luck. lives people's ideas, and, although ordinary people adaptable, leaders (in fields) lack curiosity events surround often taken surprise.** AutoMod sucks. 

Ducey let cities decide. decided mandate masks state wide mandate would effective. Ducey avoided call even paying tests anyway? mean, point, shit mandatory 100% covered. Guh. said ""would go"" ""are going"" ""plan"" yet, ding dong. Would possible bring light inside body, either skin way? wife grew area (had never IE meeting her) havent back since early March. Goddamn miss Baker’s 😭 bad use powers win lottery! ;-) Yeah got people calling governor idiot standards first place. We're gonna get hit going pretty. really wish virus affected people knowingly causing crap. sickening took trip recently state mask usage way higher alot states went through. wonder look like weeks head back. I'm holed woods :) I’m pretty sure too. recently metal show smallish venue. 103+ fever, delusions, fatigue, couldn’t stay awake, sore throat, bad cough, rough days. Easily worst sickness I’ve counting Crohn’s modern-day Nostradamus🙂 even bother commenting going jam head directly asshole offered reasonable counterpoint can't refute? don’t really know answer question grocery store frequent seems running preferred brands lately. fact number 4 list already sad. hey, better wishing die used norm here. What?!?! possible good think rule could do? want fewer employees cost? us government funds basic bench research, less 5% cost bringing given drug market. Phase 2/3 clinical trials cheap - try billion dollars each, guarantee drug candidate safe effective. 

But please, tell fed’s 7% contribution means drug maker eat 93% funding. Exactly. Yup, never complain  Agreed. Like city, there's mandatory night curfew $900 fine. People still protested. takes premiums second fights pay services. 

They fight though Joe x pays $199 cash corona test get billed $6800 client Sally s. 

That's shits nuts. Price matter pay cash, credit kind insurance. exact service. 

A 15cent Tylenol cost 15 cents matter person insurance not. know! timed better. posted happened. 

For San Diego, they've shut cars today. far broke, it’s budget all.

I agree. Spending money recklessly dumb. Coronavirus cases spiking U.S. WSJ's Brianna Abbott explains dynamics outbreak, Phoenix hospital administrator Dr. Michael White talks hospital taking lessons New York's experience virus. Ugh sad. Denver, CO honestly everyone wears stores solid like 50% wear walks around neighborhood. Nearly everyone buff pull hiking/mountain biking close someone else. herpes! 

 Yes, exactly that. Lol course probably go school together there, nephew graduated E-high year class 20' oldest sister graduated 96' .

And can't really blame anyone saying Rancho instead, usually say Fontana matter hard hit F people always respond "" MONTANA?!"" .......no Fontana ... F..... pass way Vegas.....lol. America, lot people refuse wear masks precisely Trump wear one made political issue. south east we're coming hurricane season. 

States can, need pivot hard fast, that's combo want figure happens. know theyd listened wouldnt spiking again. may put work back less month. Might well take rest year care give reason say good source? Man, forgot that. I'm 36 still feels weird ever lived time cost extra money call someone next county. 2020: *Did someone say major accident?* dont donate money bar owners then. texans money. easy judge someone else's money really strange seeing news reports plenty stupid shit happening western countries too. went yesterday pick food dad. Seriously NY wtf. people following simple rule. Wear fucking mask. Thank you. Good luck too. Exercise home? this, dark ages? Remember school group project one people group totally nothing made get bad grade?

That's feel situation. lot us trying best here, read work, Billy staying night playing Xbox bringing us him. RemindMe! one week

to come back laugh face 3 Gorges dam still stands. 99% infected express symptoms 14 days. 50% 5-6 days. give week decide take test, see initial infections ~14-21 days. protests started May 30, you’d see bulk new infections June 14-21.

In Houston reversed trend small increase cases Memorial Day, sizable jump protests explosion cases last 10 days individuals infected two events spread virus bars restaurants, primarily bars. I’d suspect you’d find similar trend anywhere large protest.

Worthy cause, insanely stupid time protest it. every single case they've blasted Chinese Internet everybody else make sure interaction get infected 

The chinese media asking people get tested asap u cure early stages media admit protests contributed spike see? Oh, today 346 deaths really miss New Jersey? shutdown March/April really lasted 2 3 weeks. week 4 traffic back 80% normal. Lately, absolutely normal everywhere except 70% people wearing masks. Also pleased Kansan also ball watching whiney ass Karen’s Kyles fuss “muh freedoms” Yup scam old time, getting rich selling cheap 'cure alls' cost next nothing make, dubious effects marked beyond belief. Much political system shaped via fashion. Nothing new sun, society scam artist somewhere either lurking shadows cult following around cheering pedestal. think 2 reasons. First areas opened immediately Wisconsin cases start with, people going bars thus spreading it. 

The snow October May year, we've waiting get outside, that's lot summer gatherings take place.

That said, handful outbreaks. spike La Crosse area, well known college bar area, Madison began phase 2 reopening 2 weeks ago seen drastic rise cases young adults college bars. still want know recovery looks like 80. saw mask TRUM2020 sticker front. think mad go store without mask exercising free speech letting everyone know happy it. See? Freedom! Zombies confirmed!! rules again?! White supremacists ruining things everyone again.  work with. CKD patients, please tell true Eddie Bravo mind intensifies Interestingly, hard alcohol comes 750 ml 1.75 liters smattering liters there. call us uncivilized. use metric system counts. cannot get fucking stupid bubble vest looks. Ah yes, people don’t die covid never hospitalized young people don’t ever older people living home may literally die they’re exposed kid brought home, they?

You really thought comment through. I'm saying 40,000 new cases every day.

We need face mask mandate.

I'm dismissing it. I'm saying need one thing. like he's wafting without deciding get 4th July revenue. already. going get hell lot worse let people gather July 4th. also vote him, I'm really sure seen anything he's done disagree with. I'm also glad pandemic I'm sitting around wondering ""what would life like office"" (like another government position country). someone NY, knew shit would happen.

All bar kitchen buddies remarking numbers standard season - really weird given circumstances - *higher* normal.

People champing bit go out. someone hates going worked industry long, bothers deeply.

Is paying 4X much drink playing round pool really missed passtime jeopardize everything spent 4 months trying help? “...spreading like wildfire...” 😐 bull. US Tax dollars funded kinds medications past, medicines still extremely expensive US. Literally yes, wouldnt issue people catastrophically stupid. also need wait long all. 

Also, America let's working class rot starve times like mean rest world Ppl hate great news sub. posted crazy headline yesterday full sensationalism almost 6k upvotes. fit political narrative supports crappy ""leader"" done gets brushed aside. Notice India Times? American media reporting either. keep fear keep viewers. crazy post yesterday lol 👇

Coronavirus link worldometer dashboard. everyone hysterical cases America deaths falling since April 18th. live state doubt able lock way people wont listen. 

hold butts people start dying party wants believe ? like numbers ? CHINA NO1 ! Ya nothing like recent grads working fast food that's hiring.   Honestly started, thought businesses people going move northeast. business operate chaotic mess Az TX states plan leadership? Businesses won’t invest don’t even know they’ll open tomorrow. America going hurting paying higher taxes states leadership, plan, “this is” regulations may like paying insurance policy stay open. Knowing you’ve 3 months plan, prepare, carry safety regulations........and yet still caught guard running around head cut off? complete utter failure every level it’s cringeworthy watch.  But... show must go on! ok, i'm denying it, asked efforts eradicate covid. saying funding 6 efforts ""eradicate cobid"" really answer question though. someone lives southern Wisconsin come ruin us like good chunk people Illinois. 😂don’t forget lazy unhinged yea also asked else stated comment see headlines research vaccines. option close entire state majority population vaccinated answer one knows. However, you’ve mitigated risk wearing masks outside. Obviously, keeping distance would lower risk, much impossible know sure. would say might want limit time spend close another person. America. That’s we’re screwed. get this, bar serves food, remain open. AZ leadership fucking joke Love it. party 'citizen's rights' successfully politicized everything, including science, shocked base listen cuz 'muh rights!' people keep asking already know answer? That’s right!!!! arbitrary outdated information pass meaningless tests schools get money. part LA? I’m SGV almost everyone wears kind mask. observe white folks wearing masks Pasadena however . place we're getting grounded.

In Trinidad Tobago, bars dine-in services allowed reopen Monday 22nd. lasted whole one week -- lovely way behaved weekend, permission bars revoked restaurants open. need close 8 PM. mention untold thousands (hundreds thousands?) people caught virus, **not** die, facing uncertain future potential permanent, long-term effects *barely* beginning *try* understand. Outdoor dining bars fine However, given government responded COVID-19, trust walk dog, much less put charge health care.

This real reason Americans refuse vote someone willing fix it: point something poorly never even setup adequately address problem first place.

Like some, [pointing George Bush Katrina] ""See FEMA government disaster relief NEVER works!!! Leave private charities CLEARLY govt. DUMDUMS!!"", grade rocks brains shit. Center Disease Control says “we lost control”? wrong 1992. took roman republic century decline tottered inability resolve crises morph empire Illinois better better! go again! Arrest man ever place gotten 80 degrees? Agreed, partially. 

Our problem mostly unequally distributed decline. insane inflation housing, healthcare, education, opportunities increasingly growing larger share wealth, middle class shrinks wages lack good stable jobs.

It's getting better worse. wealthiest mostly unaffected crisis able take advantage discounted capital, side looking wave evictions, bankruptcies, foreclosures. 

So going go dark times change way things, change hard often expensive. believe American dream even though stifled past 30 years, think adventurous hard working spirit people always have. even number one, countries amazing things I'm happy class even much learn.

And... dollar. kinda helps. Ya basically everyone know graduated college semester either unemployed working shit could've done high school. think required see everyone US. Nahhhh keep open. great job advocating country opened.

Besides, want disappoint big daddy Donnie, right? He's gonna hate taking seriously.

Remember, fake, even people dying.

We aren’t waves. contributes waves congregation like school holidays. virus continue circulate way modulate human behavior.

We need humble assertions know virus.

Everyone needs get board masks. protected, put about. Face covering something helps everyone.

Asymptomatic spread spread simply talking combined infectious symptoms show first days means need face masks.

We don’t want areas go NYC did, Texas concerning. one wants stay home order don’t want hospitals overwhelmed.

CDC website -revamped weekend. sort guidances. ways things safely. 

We want symptomatic people tested. Additional recommendations high risk settings. Asymptomatic people settings high risk contacts testing.

In addition this, surveillance people testing patients come hospitals reasons.

Questions viewers;

Shield v mask. data yet. consumer mask recommended. clinicians health care, eye protection important face shields. 

Antibodies immunity. Relative short period neutralizing antibodies. Don’t know correlated risk infection. antibodies may important. Need data.

We don’t large percent population antibodies even hard hit areas. studies needed cases.

Genetic shift. European strains better foothold Asian strains- infectious. Need research.

Vaccines. Next year flu: new strains vaccine. important. Get soon available near you. 

Project warp speed. things simultaneously vaccine works used. People working hard get done. 

Use CDC website info! seen mall? church? Id concerned places one major difference CA &amp; MA:

MA pop 6M, 8K covid19 deaths, likely ~800K actual cases (108K confirmed), ~15% infection rate, higher urbanized areas

CA population 40M, 6K covid19 deaths, likely ~600K actual cases, ~1.5% infection rate.

I'm assuming identical IFR 1%.

As another data point: new cases dropping MA, NY, NJ, CT, death rate (1000 death per 1M population) infection rate likely almost herd immunity reached somewhere 10-30% range.

PS. definitely models predicting herd immunity quite bit lower estimates R0 imply: oldest Gen Zs graduated college 2018 work force years especially didn’t go college. Lol. Collectivists. 

WTF wrong people determined selfish assholes, matter cost?

(Many ppl advocating “Christian values, might add...”)

So sad. pleasure. always good laugh yourself. good night well! strange happened America, yet want talk why. 

Hmmmmm. changing getting school - I’ve lived Arizona whole life. remember starting much later, started change high school. don’t know, used think too, Pandemic shed light many truly stubborn, selfish, stupid people US. sad much? Two months? blow 20% immunity theory water?  Members death cult getting cold feet? Yup, lying made up.  crazy sad part go assessment center symptoms get tested without pay point service....

Look I've clearly pointed weaknesses US culture. think China own? do. depends whether people able behave like responsible adults. relax restrictions people observe safety protocols, we're fine. not, there's much prevent another spike.

Bankruptcies business personal declined every year since 2015.

The stock market experience tremendous gains last decade 16/17k level 25k+ today last 4 years. (albeit volatile expected given circumstances)

I certainly experienced wage stagnation early 2010s housing crisis seen grow last 5 years well. fact unemployment called manipulated led competitive job market saw companies upping salaries attract increasingly scarce talent.

COVID-19 PCR Tests Scientifically Meaningless. Though whole world relies RT-PCR “diagnose” Sars-Cov-2 infection, fit purpose. Kary Mullis invented Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology. invention got Nobel prize chemistry 1993. Unfortunately, Mullis passed away last year age 74, inventor regarded PCR innapropriate detect viral infection

Maybe worst nonsense ever read. worked labs running PCR tests. 

When suitable primer whatever testing for, matters one bit testing presence virus elephant worth mentioning PCR tests used identify COVID-19 patients presumably infected called SARS-CoV-2 valid gold standard compare with.

Nonsense. zero need ""gold standard"". truly purification — i.e. separation object everything else object, instance Nobel laureate Marie Curie purified 100 mg radium chloride 1898 extracting tons pitchblende — essential pre-requisite proving existence virus, thus prove RNA particle question comes new virus.

This lie. tons PCR tests, whole point run separation before. useful need separate contests sample. primer made reacts want tst for; matters bunch stuff samle, primer simply react reason PCR extremely sensitive, means detect even smallest pieces DNA RNA — cannot determine particles came from

This one crazy things ever heard :) could also use nonsense prove scale work ""because cannot determine whatever weighing came PCR tests calibrated gene sequences (in case RNA sequences SARS-CoV-2 believed RNA virus), know gene snippets part looked-for virus. know that, correct isolation purification presumed virus executed.

Obviously yes, isolated January February. seem recall Italian lab order establish causal connection, one way other, i.e. beyond virus isolation purification, would absolutely necessary carry experiment satisfies four Koch’s postulates. experiment.

That's see footage protests. Always count 3 weeks. 

every big shift virus usually takes 2-3 weeks...

people going lot? expect systemic increase 3 weeks...

 massive spike infections? expect deaths 2-3 weeks... No, doesn't. People wear mask endangering everyone around them. public health menace. want removed. Look Washington DC example, protestors city. 200-300k people congregated near White House 3 weeks ago, yet neither DC, MD VA seen rise cases. fact continue decline positivity rate.

I present peotests 98% wore masks might factor, spike...

Lets wait 3 weeks sure. Funny: remember saying months ago told know talking about...

Called make sure provider network. tried call hospital ahead time get general idea much surgery would cost. told billing dept would around $5,000. told ins company per plan would pay 20% procedure, would cover 80%. OK, expensive time impossible, especially would able get seizures control. 

Two months surgery received bill. $32,000. That's much owed. hospital network, something one told something known ask. insurance company tell called inquire procedure beforehand. 

I admit naivete ignorance matter, believe tried make informed decision possible deciding surgery. known would saddled amount never would proceeded. 

Needless say, still paying it. could student loans paid now. could driving something nicer hand car. could afforded pursue higher degree. can't, medical debt. Idiocracy. president movie realised depth hired best person available try find solution problem. exactly what's going now, it? Can't stop animal farming. know people like eat meat come on, pretty clear current population levels bad idea. sustainable. saw point raised next level. I’m asking look past topic look many various things happening ....

Nevertheless, digress, you’re right, let’s wait. wish safety good health. comment stupid, can’t tell whether master sarcasm fool. Bravo sir, Evan !  one person made contest lol. said teens hurting too, younger kids short attention spans need structure classrooms most.  think US healthcare system sick sociopathic. Richest country world can't afford curing/treating common ailments. Maybe true, really doubt it. So, like $5 aspirin hospital? GOOD. protests helping. US? Poland even though whole system mess (lost results, swabs without name flooded, least region live). study Stockholm (not peer reviewed yet larger studies follow) indicates immunity lot higher previous antibody studies show. tested t-cell immunity people small symptoms asymptomatic.

If I'm understanding correctly, that's big part decline spreading, hopefully means second wave fierce. God bless patience try attempt educating individual understanding incompetent. unfortunately, one never enlighten individual stupidity. 5 year old niece doesn’t issue mask. Deaths. New Zealand laughs map. guys screwed.

Most EU countries immediately closed large businesses public places back March/April masks mandatory everywhere since then.

Now mostly here, Czech Republic wear masks anymore starting tomorrow businesses open again. Absolutely this. madness.

No concern collective troubling see. Even something like 30% ish people (a stat read here, can't remember source) refuse wear mask, high percentage protect health others.

If actually admitting people hospital rate is, would get it.

Fact is, deadly virus spreading ignorant it, devastating. know much it, yet people can't simply wear mask. longer spreading ignorance, spreading idiots.

Dan Ashcroft right along. funny, lived Myrtle Creek 5 years teenager, least 3 hanging dad's street last year. ""concrete jungle"" live in, live woods ways outside alsea. Biggest city I've ever lived growing philomath. long? doc 1 month never got bloodwork kept daily regimen afterwards wonder I’m deficient again. I’m glad people already said something fuck. think point deaths rise ignored stupid question. end Oregon trail. Thanks Lmao fuck kids kind things would best interest? gates worshipers like this. Historically, mandates viewed contempt courts number reasons - fact requiring people buy things want (why health insurance mandate thrown out) might part masks fight. courts would weigh mandates, would imagine. things pass muster (must car insurance drive road instance), tied exercise something considered privilege (driving). Would buy, maintain wear mask pass constitutional review things deemed privilege? sure. kind doubt it.
 
But opinions pretty worthless - 9 people who's opinions actually matter. me, biggest problem government forcing policing masks front line workers. countries worked, government mandate upheld government. people paid enough deal shit government's job top own. I'm familiar quote democracy, reality speaks louder words. Right idiots majority. Add Futurama list rage machine. like things still vote. millennial. Giant douche 2029! define victim? base deaths infections? AFAIK old die people become infected potentially suffer long term effects.. Shut learn. Also someone mentioned cases detected earlier. came serious news made laugh.

I'm upset. Take upvote. Arkansas, USA.

not sure slipped radar thought ya'll might interested.

""Gov. Hutchinson said majority churches state following health guidelines, noting seen increase case numbers.

“That’s something encourage pastors churches realize consequence following guidelines number cases break actually ill people people die virus,” Gov. Hutchinson said.

The governor also said avoiding creating giving directives specific churches issue, state health officials discussing issue churches clusters.""

so he's going ""name shame"" instead actual laws, got it. believe you. reason hate crimes started spiking post 9/11 never really went down. remember Fox News anchor coming fast food joint talking dangerous damn middle easterners are, sickening now. great aunt uncle going freak! we’re going immigration

He says, without hint irony, within nation immigrants. Smh. Surprised didn’t cough produce way tbh numbers economy? Last heard exactly impact economy everybody else, herd immunity 68000 cases 10 million people seems far fetched me. TLDR - here’s primary info article, fear porn headline


Local health authorities said official numbers bed capacity paint misleadingly bleak picture.


Michael Ditoro, chief operating officer Desert Regional Medical Center, said facility hit ICU-bed capacity “well prior COVID. Year year.” medical center’s surge beds equally equipped treat patients regular ICU beds, said. Yeh. Since least many decades so-called ""soothsayers"" warned serious pandemic 2020. shiny pen? also growing number people asymptomatic mouth breathing / yelling people wear mask. Sure, understand let die they’re also spreading that’s real issue. think stupid, probably smarted us. :) Everyone going keep locking down.

If one person NY going spread, lockdowns reset exponential growth republic, one actually work. can’t control now, we’d need another 6 week full lockdown smart reopening, much virus US contain I'm confused logic. would Germany, battle ground state cold war solid plans US never danger would? cold war potential measure pandemic? talking biological warfare measures? idea immune system works.

Thanks,
Have nice day. “Most recovered long-term potential unknown...”

But hey, let’s keep perpetuating fear titles continue establish pieces different puzzles. thing I’ve actually learned one knows way up... disengenuous response. I'm ears want tell going work. becoming definition stupidity. monkeys going close reopen new cases drop mask policy. What’s going change? bars/social gatherings etc issue, passage time you? People go back bars there’ll another outbreak. We’re doomed states hate us. america never chance. Ok? going down. Comes back? never left first place work one boardwalks jersey shore. feel like boss one taking large number precautions. get many people give us shit tell need wear mask enter store. statement true though. highest quality people come motel rates even cheaper usual, really large group teenagers, poor folk, trashy people. Badly. drives people inside tighter poorly ventilated spaces, air conditioning spaces spreads further. No, people. selfish ones. I'm perfectly fine restricting lot usual activities months know what? I'm taking threat freedom virus becoming poli_tical subreddit blocks poli_tical comments, struggle going get difficult. 


Just put poli_tical concepts end ""ism"" bot block comment. 


For rest, I'll go get popcorn... say was, explaining said. think believing leadership completely beholden China would ridiculous though. really disrespectful died nurses doctors even use word ""nothingburger"" connection virus. Can't pause online game. smh. lockdowns waste.

If one person it, spread. best lockdown simply turns back clock beginning spread.

But spread happen again.

It started one person need start one person.

So lock want keep coming back reopen Headline tomorrow: bird blinded thrown salt hits car, car hits tanker causing explosion leading nuclear waste fire. guys better hope leader keeps US/Canada border closed. reopen US/Canada border cases skyrocket people start heading Canada hope people reading realise inherent risk take factory farming. 99% livestock factory farmed US. animals cramped together highly unsanitary conditions (also workers, coronavirus spread rapidly tyson food 'plants (slaughterhouses'. first time virus swept livestock populations, we've african swine fever, bird flu, swine flu, sometimes ends spreading humans.

China must punished isolated entire globe releasing lying virus purpose

That country polluting parasitic tumor upon world, nothing good comes Yeah is... grandparent country laws allowing citizenship prove that, could emigrate. Exactly fight invisible enemy stop You’re missing point completely. Ah that’s fit here. read there's 70+ cases Grosse Pointe cluster (secondary, tertiary cases) already yesterday  That’s terribly lame excuse, considering people start sewing almost immediately. incompetence masks end costing US tens thousands lives. know fucking propaganda even country, Romania, fools talking this.

As one richest man world would want fucking microchip world we'd know. Miami-Dade County recorded highest total last two weeks 1,591 positivity rate 17.7%

Miami-Dade County's population 18% black 69% seeing Covid-19 cases skyrocket among young According Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, median age positive Covid-19 cases March 65 years old. within last week, dropped 35 years old. That's wrong, see one. mean they'll see one eventually mean cases see necessarily translate wave. best data have.
 
Mask usage common events outdoors, mass gathering still risk taken people decided worth fight racism systemic injustice. did, built military hospitals country. took nowwwww scrambling put back up. Well technically means less people infected less dead short term, likely change end result long term.  major centres Texas followed suit.... post 4th July going nuts case count numbers. people take seriously. I'm healthy mid 30s left work March 11 gone back. I'm trying get I'm trying spread it. Covid19 R0 1 masks, especially non-medical ones, reduce R0 slightly. Close contact still results illness. yes, covid19 claimed, likely infected least one person. amount asymptomatic presymptomatic spread, that's important everyone wears them. know.

What stat heard recently 10% aged 18-34 carriers majority showed little symptoms. happened slowing spread overwhelm system? guess that's thing anymore. virus going away beacuse put mask I'd happy see dollar theatres opening serve beer pizza $10/person. sincerely apologise fellow Poles. Japan letting EU citizens though? seen press release that. accepted job I've stuck NL months visa application closed. probably picked surface delivery. There's still lot people ICU use ventilators largely down. normal flu. legally can’t use bbq anywhere property... fair blatantly lied early said masks weren’t useful. good reason, general public rushed buy masks would 1.) nearly enough go around. 2.) enough healthcare system. 

So understand lied, fact matter still lied consequences. think message good disagree said thing bothers leaving individual decide themselves. think that's worked well far unfortunately thing think would work happen. literally led it’s “likely” didn’t get March without proof. told someone else use term exact capacity. adequate names - two qualities exactly people need pandemic, they're short supply far. Social Distortion fan...i'm feeling age right statements invalidated. prefer listen someone first hand experience using lab test kits question someone give indication posts factual. try walking ventilator \* governments looking allowing reunification family members couples time? It’s really hard away love supposed sharing household ith know. Taking approach ICU beds available trying fill really wrong. Ok fine, need make argument possible transform liberal society authoritarian one, consider risks going catastrophically wrong, whether there's chance virus still spread (as seen many authoritarian states), likely governments relinquish power over.

I personally believe century event kills around 0.5% (mostly elderly already frail) people infects worth transformation society authoritarian state. latest Texas Medical Center Houston:

* Much Information ^_lol_ *HAPPYHAMSANDICHEZZ!* Ventilators kill Considering see videos yes. look Florida people cramming INSIDE buildings MASK. look protests they're OUTSIDE MASKS.  No. support anyone reckless spreading virus, matter cause. Smart move given circumstances warned us 5 years ago shall :-) Go ahead - give shit do. plan, going happen, enjoy - live life. Yeah hopes high ones. argument it’s mostly young people infected wrong. 

I know multiple young people 20s 30s caught virus serious complications. 

I’m talking spending two weeks hospital oxygen month barely able walk stairs. 

There cases young people get stroke symptom covid before. opinion piece lol U.S. lots virus, treat. Bring chair outside you. sightings bears news rhode island Yep. Even Texas governor admitted making mistake opening them, ordered reclosed. asking - one rebuked everything said ***you failed produce ONE piece evidence absolutely fundamental whole debate***. 

**Without evidence, entire argument falls flat face**. So, I'll ask - it? live RI new outbreak South Carolina family visiting. don’t know full story I’ve heard one attended party infected everyone useful story. 

At point, 10mn worldwide infections, MUST empirical data common ways actual infections probably occurred - eg close/persistent contact . mins known case (that would include care homes etc), living house healthcare worker, someone travelled, going bar friends, unknown etc. 

But perhaps knowing data would cause us relax social distancing share stats. Because, idiots. met Karen days ago accused shop workers drunk power enforcing one one queue limit numbers shop. I'm sure really get kick standing door waving people day long. reckon 100 000 + day infections whole USA next week so. stay in. Let others can’t don’t want live lives, without threat put chains. Even can't enforce it, still big effect. undoubtedly large number people understand unenforceable cancel trip fear quarantined ""deported"".

Then there's another group fence travelling measures like send strong signal bad idea visit right now. know one person boat. Austin much Texas many would like believe, unfortunately. Eat rich instead! get covid unite That’s isn’t argument, asked definition pandemic, posted. 

You open links posted you’d like nitpick criteria met. trying say wasn’t pandemic March 11, needn’t continue discussion, clearly sharp disagreement. 

Nothing terms ‘response’ changes with, zero control domestic action begin with. US declared national emergency two days called pandemic, *not* two days PHEIC declaration. Whether intended, US didn’t take ‘seriously’ called pandemic. That’s influence has. wait long PHEIC precisely lack urgency speaking of. try stay politics make angry oh, there's absolutely nothing individual vote seems like past years come light votes really matter much used think do. saying mask mandate would save money?? 

Oh honey that's think ""good guys"" want even know think ""bad guys"" Insane, isn’t it? don’t see sports team masks, tech company masks, fashion masks, joke masks, RGB LED masks, Bluetooth masks. It’s endless. There’s awful lot money left table. Don’t put words mouth. virus doesn’t care politics neither I. I’m “outraged” either protest, poorly timed dangerous middle pandemic. Yes. That’s point. wearing mask risking others health. That’s mandates make sense. wearing mask isn’t personal risk it’s public risk. couple people protested nation's hotspot end testing positive equate massive spike due protesting someone lived Florida lives Jersey yes. mean, technically still useless unless sick. issue COVID vast majority people slight symptoms even realize they're sick - solution make people wear masks, ensure sick people on. First all, transition online learning happened course weekend virtually time prepare train teachers. So, yes, bound disaster. time summer, could focusing training everyone, teachers, parents, students, succeed remote environment. 

Second, 70% alarmingly high considering spikes half US states, said worst yet come... fall... school session. take everything say gospel truth, signs pointing way right now. 70% saying agree going back school precautions tells people value economy mutual funds teachers’ health safety. It’s pain ass tutor kid(s) work time, get that. option, going cope? dare take hope away. 

I attest constitutional rights allowed hope none. 

Talk lawyer call Monday. Well flew right left wings, weird flesh bag.  think gave idea wearing mask infringement rights? read ""We definitive study back recommendation, based virus spread correlation data, recommend requiring fabric masks.""

I shown several locations flatly says recommend fabric masks. Now, honest saying study done full scientific rigor, honest.

The study recommends use fabric masks would take long time properly vet. Yet, see masks potential way reduce spread want make recommendation since benefit right little cost wrong.  California also double New York’s population, Los Angeles numbers starting resemble NYC. Mark words world looks back shit show see Sweden’s approach correct one. countries waiting vaccines delusional. around another year least. say squat COVID potentially becoming pandemic Italian morgues overflowing. would thought China quarantining entire cities would tipped COVID another flu. Regulating media exactly China ensure people get best information. 

Regulation issues, easily turns propaganda state. alien invasion. robot uprising. dolphin ascendancy. watch daily press briefings read comments NJ 101.5 Facebook page. commenters page “hurr durr ” wingnuts. also 7-10 wingnuts. Murphy done great job considering fact NJ 1st 2nd positive cases, numbers ICUs numbers ventilators number deaths weeks. sudden numbers dropped able start opening. Unfortunately indoor dining needs place draw line now. Casinos too, live county see increased taxes county revenue lost. need stay closed now. Nationalized health care cost nothing get test, get one.

Try go Quebec hospital get test, find one. Yea sorry misread comment thought said two drinks two people (two total) would $55-60. Immunology sorely neglected field study. isolation scientists tell IL-6, IL-12, memory cells, etc. aggregate functions dysfunctions largely mystery. college taught cytokine storm something affected young people ""strong"" immune systems. backpedal corona causing CS far older patients causal mechanism seems high production cytokines aging immune system's inability rein response in. applying duct tape float tubes yacht maintenance actually concerns infection rate Britain large enough demonstrate effectiveness. needed country virus expanding contracting. 

A seconds googling help fears. Yep, beginning thought so, too. guy wig tanning lotion unfortunately ruined it. It’s call Breezus Why? underestimate intelligence people running schools. know what's going happen, trying meet demands government, know probably happen. contained means burnt conditions controlled Fuck misinformed. Stop getting information Fox president, they’re lying cover asses. 40,000+ cases day due increase testing result poor leadership misinformation. Stop fool believing every conspiracy theory. Nearly every country outside US seeing downward trends US keeps increasing, rapidly. Florida Texas reaching record breaking numbers day reach apocalyptic numbers coming week due exponential growth. 

You’ve got real fucking idiot think there’s money made hospitalisation sir putting people ventilator. real number deaths US 20,000 50,000 recorded (according excess deaths pneumonia deaths counted COVID), anything deaths undercounted. Please, stop braindead believing whatever nonsense fits narrative serious hundreds thousands people die result. long AC turned on, air circulates return-air grille. good filter system, stops inside duct work. Without filters, continues circulate. New Jersey know I'm assuming they're wanting squeeze little money 4th July first. Yeah far know body doesn’t keep antibodies forever cells keep “recipe” them, meant people claim there’s thing keep getting reinfected same/ worse severity die what’s bothering still years away blows mind people turn someone literally donated billions charitable causes plans donate almost entire fortune. one want something good world more. No. said $55-60 four drinks (two per person). riot fits waking life tho ever Manhattan? density NYC unlike nearly everywhere planet. Use brain.

Joe “MAGA” Rogan sucks dudes dick live air times year. I’m sure we’ll revisiting couple weeks.  Yeah. Honestly things considered early shutdown saved FUCK TON lives Cali. Fuck states orders. I’m staying home there’s vaccine. don’t understand bars getting closed restaurants aren’t. Masks removed eat, there’s still large crowds, servers travel table table. Servers often sit chat guests, too, it’s bare minimum contact.. business gets large crowds sit remove masks extended periods time isn’t safe right now. education ever compete text entry skills google search. mean everyone type stuff keyboard. Anyway COVID research fund size yearly budget yacht maintenance. Ebola, SARS, MERS contained successfully. get home, bill $350 arrives. seems high, perhaps that's much bought. Two weeks later, bill deli arrives $76.01. that, there's $87 fee cashier fees, whatever is...  USA hot pudding. 

That means *deep shit* really California thus far whatsoever. Good, needs happen soon CA, Texas Florida well. You’re saying places serve $30 cocktails? That’s wild. expensive cocktail bar area serves most, $15 cocktail.

Edit: sorry realized said two drinks make much sense lol think many states even requiring symptoms anymore. hope last meal fried chicken mashed potatoes. Holy shit that's lot tests Touche Technically bars weren’t open. serve food too. That’s Donovan’s Djais could reopen. def following protocol. revolt want going help... LOL like take it. I'd change slightly "".. LEAST many people disease"". 

In separate thread I'm hearing QC, again, people denied tests meet criteria (in case, enough symptoms). That's one way keep numbers low...and get people spending money. spread out. drive 80 mph highway directions hour hit end valley. huge comparison spread out. Plus like infrastructure like subways contaminate people. use light rail bus system. jot like new york city. Jesus. real. Latest data difficult interpret respect ""flow"" since Quebec reporting weekly. 44 new deaths reported today (29th) across Canada -- 7 Ontario 37 Quebec. think really means daily national rate 13 new deaths. 

Ontario reported 257 new cases, 82 general population community spread 170+ among foreign temporary workers farms South-East towards Windsor. Clearly 14 day quarantine protocol put place work 3 FTWs died date. Public Health playing catch-up test FTW population farms. Note: FTWs access testing healthcare without charge although I'm sure there's little pressure employers work. Current public health protocols (e.g. letting asymptomatic infected FTWs work precautions sounds dubious me).

BIG LESSON US never assume virus gone away vigilance must maintained. god...theres hope. part put game crack knuckles matter what, win. people China horrified clusters ~300 infections reported three prisons across China. Social media flooded memes like ""the dangerous place... actually still dangerous"" ""jfc people prison time still can't get away it"" ""who said prisons safest places be?"" ""Yay, freedom one month! Ow f* hell, got changed death sentence"" ""The head prison go prison now"". I'm absolutely baffled little US seem care imprisoned people. goes back Nixon. Nixon party cannot named realized needed way defend media. Ever since propoganda network created them. Reagan screwed economy sent us path ""starve beast"" politics coupled marriage religion party can't named. 2000 Supreme Court literally altered path history picking president us. come home roost past years; dumbed zealot electorate political race bottom candidates. 

While personally see 2000 SC's interference true beginning end, point return (imagine things would gore won), truth Nixon probably true start all. people breathing hard exercising... People Chicago seem taking seriously mask wearing compared I’m (hour-ish north Philly).
This past weekend, girlfriend went Chicago get away long weekend. nice dine outside, got takeout well meals addition walking around checking sights. 

We stumble upon bar crowded letting people in. could tell right kind people patronized bar kind person ran place. went drinks, find casual conversation bartenders “whole Covid thing hoax” “it’s conspiracy trump can’t win”...speaks volumes. $80k + month Restaurant needs takeout delivery only. Dining working.  No. I’m worried overwhelming hospitals ICUs. Poor people. AZ checking in. Woulda loved messaging 2 months ago fam. I'd call COVID symptoms cruel unusual punishment. said thing. Wtf thinking? much? daughter sounds like grow responsible caring person. Good job! Exactly well said encouragement governments around world exercise, eat healthy, get healthy weight, stop smoking, ensure you’re getting right amount vitamins. strange. aren’t encouraging healthy lifestyles would save lives measures taken? 

I understand care homes ect, that’s separate issue countries around world completely failed protect. surgeon general much better Affordable generous... make better masks supposed mandatory? One says they're still elective operations? wow. fair, learned masks inhibit virus Pretty similar Singapore, mostly young migrant workers infected death rate pretty low guess everything legal New Jersey. Well, one special idiot would listen Fauci instead talking injecting disinfectants praising malaria medications, lot would already ;) think us vs them..

They 'god flag freedom tradition america vs everyone'

And rest 70%+ population america 98%+ population worldwide.. see eating? rained outdoor patio eating...outdoors. dude mask inside standing. link literally disproves said.

More people died 3 months Covid entire year regular flu. definitely does. 

“So far 1 death every 1,166 people 65 years old (compared 1 death every 358 people general population). 89% times, person died one underlying medical conditions.”

Perhaps need better reading comprehension skills. feel even worse idiots upvoted you. want glom ask: don’t antibodies disappear naturally get virus again, point immune system recognizes threat starts making again? 

Like don’t antibodies every infection we’ve ever still blood, right? everyone concerned antibodies disappearing normally should? pleasure, noticed getting downvoted usual today. I'd like know informative posting truly appreciated us. think said one day go away. think trying optimistic. Trump's ability understand science aside.. things stand wearing masks good strategy look societies handling it.. we're going know what's best.

The fact fatality rate high worth shutting already fragile society over. 

Do want endless cycle outbreaks everybody work miserable? risk people die life goes on? simplest way mitigating. needs proper enforcement. Oh, definitely. course plays factor, too. great aunt die year, hospital attributed death covid, though everyone family swears heart failure killed her.

 tried explaining flu deaths get counted; flu die, regardless whether final nail coffin heart stopping, still count flu death. inconsistent COVID?

I tried, anyway. think fair say original definition relevant anymore comes classifying countries, even then, US Third World country regardless. the- mean opinion media pages eg facebook twitter handling misinformation easily spread complete lack moderation comments articles. many false, racists, sexist etc comments never moderated would expect community standards world. I'm big college sports fan, every year there's always teams get overrated media / coaches polls. equivalent #1 ranked team (USA) getting blown random Division 2 school first second week season.

Makes wonder areas USA's capabilities grossly overrated? Maybe go drug makers website shoot email asking it? They’re required shops? That’s insane. top. causes increased infections! act excited lmao  Im knowledgeable read article step moms general surgeon news. hospitals already red COVID-19 hit. didn’t talk got there, already struggling this. I’m sure problem COVID-19 really highlighting problems America once. Percentage positive tests stayed low likely large uptick new cases confirmed numbers suggest. 

A younger cohort primarily getting infected now.

Might still early, hopefully trend persists. Excellent points. I'm certainly hoping continued common sense guidelines quell chronic condition months come. slow steady wins the.....covid body count? irresponsible fantasist governments formulate pandemic response around assumption people accept serious restrictions daily life unspecified amount time, large growing personal economic cost.

OK hey guess people accept anyway, disease going worse!

The fantasy world y'all live option save economy ignorant dogbrained lunacy. open eyes look literally anywhere else world happening. Great fear-mongering bullshit. Wtf, military presence China. hell talking ""My husband’s brother stationed Navy Beijing, we’d following pandemic closely since January. "" #MAGA really surprise it? states well others breeding grounds contamination already it.  NY seeing 10,000 cases day, also ~1000 deaths. comparison, FL yet break 100 deaths/day.

NY's positive test rate got 50%. 10,000 cases/day 10,000 cases represent actual number people virus. words, risk losing everything account small portion economy. higher risk frontline workers? mean nothing economy keeping poor people feeling secure fact still go Walmart food shelves. That's end this. Now. way shuttering mandatory masks. people masks.

It's almost like saying Hurricane Katrina minor event killed certain number people neglecting fact large portions people evacuated even though many evacuated many people remained died time depends means (and interpret) word “prisoner”. 

If means “we cannot stay home need prudent open dial back opening needed”, seems reasonable. No. Indoors public place? Wear freaking mask. Yeah, wash hands gloves.

The Netherlands single digit daily deaths. Guess why? Masks! guess people multiple degenerative health issues dying really surprising me, signal ""died lockdown"".  thing high quality Facebook friends. Everyone decent deleted theirs. hit point return Country? Well fuck. I've never happier live CT. testing numbers gone though, think 70k 40k. one go removing true disinformation, venturing censorship? standards set, enforced? Given social media markets *platforms,* considered discussing removal content site? Northern Virginia, people wearing masks here. think ones used rehab/recovery beds hospitals full covids. closed now. ""Some"" military bases  happened all. KNEW masks would help said common folk get masks detriment healthcare workers. government admitted did. like lied government of, People. hate sub follows narrative like lemmings sea, posts meme-like comments people attention span goldfish. Yes, looks faster scale provided. even scale seems leveling off, sadly confirms notion regional bottlenecks systemic problems prevent increase continuing has: uk really like america lite, it? Complete rednecks different accent.  Well way certainly place actually great.  ever check indexes, unable read red hat wearing? bad, 71k number 8500 day. guy almost die? 'immune' so... good. yet ""reported"" ICU's loaded almost capacity. hospitals hiring back people laid off? see media saying anything that... "" need help. do. attempt psychoanalyze someone knowledge think they're wrong"" 

hypocrite

&amp;#x200B;

or given right say feeling hurt? attack others feelings hurt, turn victim hypocrite. childish something need deal with. pretty sure would pass normal day Walmart. Well, we've always said solid proof. There's difference trusting authority trusting authority. scientist's authority scientific data relevant study different politicians authority over... well nothing really. time scientist can't actually make anybody anything, politician make people practically whatever want - really authority?

I think scientist 'expertise' authority. always better trust expertise (knowledge, wisdom, foresight, skill) authority (the ability force people something). agree. almost didn’t post decided share it. Maybe wrong.

There lot article based research hasn’t peer reviewed. Underrated comment :D Brilliant. everyone hang close quarters friends backyards. Guess that’s easier trace least.... people comply is. Wait, really? excuse Sunday processing time makes clear they're deliberately processing fewer tests. 70k per day last week. ridiculous joke. Way go USA! fucking surgeon general

The majority misinformation USA due politics. certain political leaders made COV-19 pissing contest, almost everyone else still seems want (or wanted) informed without herded political camp. things like constantly bombarded ""we would flattened curve Republicans would have"", ""we would flattened curve Democrats would have"", etc., could starting harm would initially thought, desensitizing people form apathy.

Can't wait. TWO WEEKS TWO WEEKS TWO WEEKS Buckle folks. sometimes seems like Americans want feeling domination upon people 'below' themselves. USA greatest army, dominating force world common people realize dominated rich. plus side though, west closer herd immunity ""Long term immunity"". ie. greater 12(?) months misinformation

what misinformation? Please confuse thing American. vast majority us batshit crazy. Sweden handling pandemic wont second wave. literally elected one president. Ok. Blame POTUS office 3 years Pelosi, Schumer, Waters, Feinstein Biden combined 236 years politics. Pathetic! Brave post Herd immunity pipe dream, failed experiment Sweden.

well sure made mind, you?

please hand us explanation ICU admittance deaths falling quickly. restrictions also like call nonexistent? see people wearing masks feel unsafe, don’t kick rocks? don’t right shop, right? friend works Mr.Nice Guy cannabis dispensary oregon people upper management position told workers supposed refuse service anyone doesn’t wear mask. manager runs shop doesn’t agree outlook friend knows fired reason upper management finds turned away people disobeying new rule.

Close secondary schools universities, visitors elderly caring homes, 50 ppl crowds, bars/restaurants regulations (50 ppl, serving table, 2m dist). Recommendation as, work home, stay home showing symptoms, social distancing, recommendations older people. probably missed some. Perfect? Probably not, e.g testing, better elderly homes, etc, etc. People ICU covid beds dropped 200 150 last week. people really stupid dont know air lungs comes mouths...? America fucked. beaches cause problem. It'll pubs. Loads drunk people noisy packed pubs shouting friends' ears 2cm away. ""Countries Italy legendary government dysfunction hit hard virus"" 
Hey! They're talking country! advantage homogenous culture

As long culture brain dead. I'd hate see culture 99% population thought hoax. Thank quite germaphobe current situation really helping ideal worry catching new strain flu top covid terrifying Lol estimate 6500 deaths end december. need look worst flu outbreak history Sweden cause lockdown (i.e every single one past couple decades) compare 6500 deaths. one multiple flu season worse outbreaks, safe say Sweden made right decision? Take Israels upswing then, other, say is: deaths/ICU cases going down, woods yet; debatable that?! mother :( Yes ! right. hope never see face November. president's job enforce constitution. Dibs, dips. anyone else initially read EVERY post begins ""WHO"" question? know old organisation is, surely come better acronym. That’s broad brush there. I’m 40 always wear mask. wife masks kids (side note - it’s hard keep 2 4 year olds). Even Fox News watching laws wearing masks rational people around.  Location- PA argument, observation. Sorry, I'll make sure run every possible source next time commenting Reddit body cares! I’d love see Trump urge people actually get coronavirus vaccine it’s available market. taught existence great first even didn’t, it’s great vaccine, best even. countries jealous smarts quality vaccine. 

But push like drug dealer? cannot even imagine that. be, “for want it, anyone needs it, want it, get it. Everyone wants get today” Unless cop folks would ok spreading flu, also kill immunocompromised? Pieces-of-shit. I'm starting see people wearing masks wearing Brooklyn. I've got bad feeling this. diseases one thing common: often associated low vitamin level. The applies, example, elderly, also frequently deficient vitamin risk. Professor Hans-Konrad Biesalski University Hohenheim Stuttgart points connection title catches Hopefully we've learned something hopefully that's true, even death rate seems around 1 percent. great, scary thought. reports even die could long-lasting damage lungs parts body. I'm trying say want get thing, even fatal you. think ever said fake. thinks serious scientists say, that's stupid enough. Well still restricted list many EU countries. Swedes started doubting theory Norway Denmark kept travel restrictions place Sweden opening eachother. understand business guy thinks ignoring pandemic eventually going good business?

Because needs stock market stay afloat Nov. 7. care. Please add BREAKING headline


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Hardly. People quite happy walk around outside shops. Masks almost non-existant. Basically nothing changed except we've belatedly started protecting elderly bit.

Lets generous assume million least. 5% total infected herd immunity. even close. general herd immunity requires minimum 95% 17 million people New York. even good argument, last notable person argued it. Boris Johnson almost it.  would old, infirm people go? problem AZ old people getting it. look (and believe #s) age group 20-44 around 36000 cases roughly 1000 hospitalizations. People 65+ roughly 9000 cases 2000 hospitalizations. places 20-44 frequent, assume. He's done piss poor job one wears masks around here, even though cities require it. know people say ""medical condition"" allowed ask it. Stupid. I’m 51 April.

I’m turning gallons Canadian whiskey Yeah I’m getting flashbacks. feel start sort sub “new” again. early March refreshing sub every minute felt like.

We're solidly placed generation attain wealth parents. white American dream dead, they're pissed  People afraid wear masks.

Facebook feed would disagree, sadly. Sure, world made decisions based Lancet Imperial. Yet everyone blames China playing it, yet R0 saying higher many others. Seems little skewed me. really going knit pick going memory saying 4-6 instead 3.5 - 5.5 that's actually quoted, think point still stands. Mississippian here,

Nobody gives shit COVID.  people running beaches running around public without mask feel like hoax simple flu.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, fucking nursing homes SCORES people die matter weeks.  One home went 67 patients **27 PATIENTS ONE WEEK.** Larry Kudlow right second wave. even finished first. scares think quicker version climate change. one going even worse That’s fine “smart”. Unfortunately many people days aren’t. didn’t get moon listening everyone. trusted people titles, science. No, I'm saying intelligent people provide kids choose kids, meanwhile 10,000 people can't so, choose kids, hurts society more.

I never said specifically, direct statement. general overall concept.

Oh wait... Ya think? Love dowvotes - man sub brainwashed research I’ve said nothing things verified online - there’s reason us government took gates court back day - he’s shady business man - practices unethical - multiple conflicts interest - India gotten raw deal Gates - yall gotta research it’s like talking brainwashed msnbc watchers literally don’t even realize MSNBC partially owned Microsoft long time. I’m sure none know stock activity - especially investment ever publicly sued maintain control given contracts build new hospitals covid 19 - sika. hey wanna believe got he’s good guy - research - worries gonna argue - he’s one man - important enough - systems gonna love long companies/organizations/the trust/whatever goals already goals way many people stop eventually already told us wants. digital ID card - eventually wearable device like smart watch collect biofeedback reward w ability use cryptocurrency - also invade privacy similarly w they’re China tracking go do, hold health records, provide data everything body temp throughout day irregular heart beat patterns neural activity. doesn’t need put chip anyone he’s gonna sell everyone wearable item convenient phone use create digital world identification system he’s trying id2020. refuse wear - store takes anything crypto devices - won’t choice give access unprecedented information essentially wind monitored time like China.

Many already hit climate change though. frequent stronger hurricanes, erratic weather patterns leading floods droughts also frequent intense wildfires. climate change looks like.

Also rising sea level rise, water high time. Instead average slowly rise means weaker storm necessary push coastal defence. point one come along pushes over, difficult explain cause climate change. Deniers almost certainly blame storm.

Climate change fairly slow process fear people keep denying decades still get used new normal time. like COVID suddenly appears. Everyone still remember life COVID half year ago. smart policy there's often delay COVID spiking detecting+implementing masks county level.

Being proactive rather playing whac mole we'll beat thing. China, STOP ALREADY FRIGGING DISEASES! Pretty much businesses except big box stores. Restaurants started opening sit-down 50% 3 weeks ago. Kept waiting waiting spike people got complacent flat case numbers restaurants opening up. Herd immunity also function social distancing measures could lower measures place. jurisdiction work swab every body COVID matter COD I’ve seen quite deaths totally unrelated COVID test positive. 50 homes entered one house decided too.

True, lots still working though. needs Medicaid something.

I'm saying great, never said that. said fked. saying fked everybody.

At point life health insurance, never. Even fiance works bed breakfast wedding venue.

I working factory too. agree. NYC things since April still managed flatten curve. key difference mainly socialize outside parks streets, people live shitty apartments, whereas people states like CA, AZ, TX spread tend congregate house parties private events. come back places allowed reach herd immunity. NYC already 1000s die per day, responsible something like 30% daily deaths US one point. now, indeed come back NYC, problem. seem like case. virus theoretically infect many people, everyone exposed get flu. You’re right. wayyy much money. evil. genuinely try help people. he’s lot right now. Yeah I'm NJ totally fine continued home cooked meals occasional takeout weekends. really need go eat time. 

I feel terrible business owners employees though. “In honesty, don’t believe” GTFO babble. Grab mask way hate paraphrase Trumper, infecting people needs infecting. fuck China? safe again

and either Thanks bro Crazy Fox burying coverage protests. double-checked April 18th. hit pretty early. I'm eastern PA, numbers high NYC spiking. Again, know states, PA three phases: red, yellow, green. Counties lower counts moved yellow (some openings) green (business usual). county went green last week, western PA counties green well month, Pittsburgh bars closing spike cases. Chinese, reason think Trump want deal coronavirus help get re-elected. put personal interests ahead national interest watched virus run rampant without anything it.

Boris Johnson contracting coronavirus actually saved lives many Brits restored sanity.

And Trump apparently still lunatic treats flu coronavirus similar diseases, even though latter least 50-100 times lethal former. jfc Weird like 10 states 3-5x pneumonia deaths last year. June. Yea NJian thats NJing thing do. It’s expected end result. reason Arizona Florida lot tests today Monday positives looked lower. Lets see resume testing  saying kids, contribute demise US? Please, tell Lol Actually lot restaurants bars trendy Bay Area downtown areas one wall facing street completely opened up. we're also idiots going pandemic matter. need resign scared. death rate people 65 like flu. didnt stuff food become obese, maybe diseases like diabetes high blood pressure. Problematic? Ooh yes stay night trying solve riddle dumbness lolololololololol think ever righted. propaganda machine well oiled US. people take selfishness new level. idea looking one another completely foreign then.  Yep, right free speech extend words intent disparage, harm, otherwise intent negatively effect someone else. However, mean negativity covered, else wise would press keeping charge check No, citizen right enter. Estimates put amount stimulus checks going people around $292.37 billion. Corporations got $500 billion. ""Small businesses"" got around $350 billion something like 40% money went checks $1 million+ probably typical mom pop shops. 

The corporate tax rate maxes 21%. person, income tax rate jumps 22% soon start making $39,475/year. Unless make standard deduction $12,400 year, going pay something taxes year without deductions disposal. Considering benefit people got CARES Act $1,200 check, best, someone working minimum wage job full-time ($15,080/year), got 8% bump wages it. make more, percentage goes down. 

What constitutes ""poor person"" debatable without conscious decision never pay back debt incurred, we're basically looking financing costs combination taxes budget cuts social safety net future. Without change tax code, corporations never pay higher effective tax rate lot workers probably even consider middle class. slash budgets food stamps, education, heating assistance, etc, that's going largest impact people definitely fall middle class. done legislation gave roughly double three times much money businesses actual people. There's almost way businesses shoulder double three times cost people paying back. That's called shifting passing cost. anyone interested, check podcast [Knowledge encapsulted version nutjob says/does pretty good analysis breakdown bugfuck crazy much grifter guy is.

You make assumptions, clear.

Yes wear face covering public. N-95 surgical mask exhale valve. bc useless govt agency subversive intentions recommended several months late. 

Why feel sorry me? OK? Yeah bring up. couple friends work RN’s apparently management screwing big time. ~60 nurses caught 2 people died management’s carelessness. This. Bush Jr., example, might well liked Germany, example, threat alliance friendship. can't spread something there. eradicated it, flattened it. Yeah entire political party runs conspiracy theories control government right now. also vast propaganda network TV radio pumping anti mask/covid 19 hoax hysteria 24/7/365. America re-enter lockdown huge surge cases hospitals overwhelmed called law. shoot you, go prison freedom over.

Yeah could turn philosophic debate freedom is. pure sense, yes thing absolute freedom exist. would similar identical anarchy. He'll let know two weeks. Decisions take time. must feel smart &lt;--- Horse  
 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Barn money Got carpet cleaned today. Two guys came door—one masked, not. let asked unmasked one, “Are going wear mask?” looked right said, “I’d rather not.” Wtffff. “Well, um...I little one here, would mind?” finally said. So, went back van got one. literally ask put mask give reason. Mind blowing. Interestingly, much older younger, masked guy. gainz Funny, I've removing anti-mask Pro-Trump people Facebook. Family, friends, former co-workers, basically everyone. 

Now I'm peaceful echo chamber. least echos sanity. It’s surging Texas, pretty hot outside already too. Usually rarely go outside summer unless it’s 10am 7pm heat get pretty unbearable. Winter pretty comfortable though. Looking crisp, dry air temps 50s-60s Jan/Feb. Hopefully virus also settles then. Fucking media looking something publish. Ask Elon guess  Docs know lot treatment months ago (main one avoid ventilator costs can. Especially showing signs looks like high altitude sickness) Missourian may say, I'm jealous put place y'all. Yeah, expecting politician human put anyone fool's wish. went pick pizza Casey’s Wichita tonight person wearing mask—5 employees, none 3 kitchen even gloves on. turned around ate PB&amp;J home. Wow 3 months late counties essentially state-sized significant differences various counties faring. 

I took hyperbole realized Los Angeles County population 7-8 times greater entire state Wyoming, areawise, fit 13 Rhode Islands San Bernardino County. ""LIBERATE FLORIDA!"" really depends community. aunt lives Sun City Center they’ve taken seriously there, seeing low rates. say they’ve taken seriously, mean even landscaping crew wearing masks. Personally don’t think someone working alone outside what’s spreading virus, good them. need wear mask development. Full stop. also cancelled social gatherings closed community spaces back March. Nothing within community reopened yet. aunt neighbors leave house walk dogs see doctors. 

Meanwhile, mom’s friends dance class could different. They’re back church, dining out, shopping, going gym dance class three times week. I’ve convinced mom go, she’s even risk group. She’s 63 super healthy. friends class 10-15 years older ton health issues. 

So really depends community. I'm Germany collegue retirement home hypes Trump somewhat god-like status. Everything says correct, can't wrong. Everything conspiracy theories lies.


I'm glad laws keeping check. Girls would go ""give number"" texting red Cross $10 donation dudes phone instead number. quickly ended. make red MAGA masks might wear them? cases *where people symptomatic*. people carry spread disease show symptoms? people going contract strain virus all? facts play worst case scenario reasoning? Trump literally signed bill law requiring transparency Yes please badly right Mike great job really caved many people threatened Amy. 3029: someone say hope? second dude. favor take shirt get daily sunlight g run humans


For now. I'm waiting AI uprising. u play casual mode plague inc
Casual is easiest difficulty, wanting quick easy game. people extremely careless, wash hands. Doctors work, sick people even given hugs. mean, someone lives GA, fans ultimately get job done too. that’s local within place, central, it’s safe right? Unfortunately, given chance take people them. That's part object to. still leader

I think true. Sorry. Restaurants arnt issue, beaches, bars, protests, karens tired really angry

Pretty much sums emotional state last 4 months. God given freedumb! ABSOLUTE TYRANNY!  you’re strong enough fight death death gonna mention mass protests? table says “anticipated” fuck think is, ancient sage?? Haha think know answer signs point certain someone doesn’t wear mask followers does. think many Europeans hoped country transformed way Trump. Trump really shock foundation Germany trusting US political military ally, basis political world centuries. Countries already banning travel US. mask? N95 similar, supposed provide enough protection. dunno there's still shortage USA, $1 piece country, readily available. science in. People stupid virus smart. 

“I can’t stay home see friends/family/insert other”

You reap fucking sow.

I’m making light virus suffering causes. I’m pointing pathetic weak can’t take simple measures protect community care about.  I’m OKC see maybe 5% people wearing masks go get groceries. It’s infuriating. get looked upon psycho leftie libtard wearing mask public around Sweden. would require Abbott grow pair balls stop corporate stooge Sadly molecules smelly compound would probably pass trough mask unimpeded. Welp I’m homeless live WA state. live tent campground (commercial one like KOA.) lost job due covid lease (they raised rent new tenant coming in, zero rights stay.) It’s near impossible get someone rent unemployment income income. It’s also impossible get job pays enough qualify places. try get motel there. It’s waking nightmare haven’t homeless, let alone homeless pandemic, please quiet less judgmental. get 6 months full pay UK. shared parents. think also take another 3 months half pay. also get keep use company car, phone, laptop.

The downside smaller companies likely avoid hiring women childbearing age. He’s got point though. Ducey said gather 6k political rally, go church service holds 500, can’t go gym. second shutdown show, teeth it’s going solve anything actually shut everything down. spent time Japan early 2000s. One things distinctly remember people wearing masks public. People even distributing free masks subway entrances Tokyo.

I told part culture wear mask others sick. wear allergies too. 

It’s one advantage homogenous culture, right? observations governments learned thing first spike. that's big if.  That's neighborhood (Whittier). None Latino neighbors wear masks huge parties every weekend. rumours hotel quarantine security sleeping quarantined travellers :p Agreed... already bought home gym equipment like bands powerblocks. Used go gym 4-5 days week. Hunkering long haul. Proud Jersey girl, even though, like commenters said, many fellow citizens illogically pissed decision Confirmed cases rise linearly number tests. positive cases rising death rate falling. white live, put luxury hotels, empty shut down. people weird names running politicians, like Duceybag? Inferior complex? Bullied child? think forgot ""/s"" that's down-voted. stating personal view however, I'll say this: would safer right everybody involved stay home workout outdoors, rather gather closed environment workout. Rip 🙏
Fuck china Obviously fake news. California perfect run actual Gods. source wrong. hope girlfriend gets mild form! shit scary. believe median incubation period 5 days 99.8% symptomatic case presenting symptoms 14th day. Dude, Germany wearing masks public indoors since April, hell US authoroties doing? guess hard pick facetious response text intended overstate emotion involve try make point. 

My bad. know better make shit truth better response. Lol right?! think people realize hard unrealistic vaccine real time. could like flu mildly effective vaccine virus mutates every year. Still dumbass believe stuff like this. hate social media. wait... What? Maybe badly formulated part, Sweden “recommended” formulated advice orders, restrictions travel 70+ age vulnerable groups one, opened travel. 

Still recommended ban groups 50+ size see govt pages there. yes, I’d say Sweden closed Norway moment, couple new restrictions adjust whatever strategy may be. Starting July? lol. fly Florida Oregon grandmother died. Fuckers sold every flight capacity. Next two strangers entire flight, half people took masks off. Insanity. Nightmare really faking it. Every country undercount cases, long dont mass testing like PRC RoK. RKI, CDC Germany officialy says cases undercounted 4-8 fold, lot asymptomatics tested.

In US local political players obfuscate reporting. Also US seriously needed surge testing even more, dont see coming fed govt. Imagine 3 months+ late. Ohio next please ""in person"" malarkey years. Kids socialize way boomers X did, even millennials Z did. Sitting across cafeteria table, they're still texting other, talking. Years ""my kid could get kidnapped/killed street, let out"" created new breed ""experts"" need get offices long overdue field work. *Now lemme welcome everybody wild wild west* hope email text. Phone calls positive.

I tested Friday, got results 4am Sunday via email Well places businesses sure do. long business smart enforces it. know right. dare owner allow people let fear control lives continue classes. need locking country destroying economy virus 99-99.5 survival rate. Plenty things kill people higher rates shut those. Covid different. CNN said would never lie us. cares Tanzania proved tests mostly BS sending sample fruit tested positive. Perhaps want stay home stay home. people want go it. already proven hospitals never overrun. fact fire staff make cutbacks getting little business. Good thing get paid people covid. I'm sure exploiting recording cases. hey least alive wish dead due cripling poverty come demolished economy. CA hit 9% today. Alas. article almost hits point. Looking diagram restaurant almost certainly using split air conditioning system cool space. almost certainly air outside utilised. happening system drawing air inside room cooling throwing accross room. Therefore virus droplets air simply moved round space. 

This im sure scenerio concearning people. imagine AC turned nothing changed otehr room lot warmer before, virus still air maybe spread reduced less air movement. However potentially could happen people aware air stale hot may encourage restaurnt owners open windows doors ventilate space better. help reduce ability virus stay air encouraging air movement could potentially effect AC unit terms spreading virus.  


Ideally want 100% fresh air system able extract supply air multiple points room whilst controling direction throw air streams. Obviously sort system might practical within small restaurant aletrnative obviously open windows help eliminate issue.  


I suppose im trying say quite long winded way simply case AC bad rather lack ventilation bad need increase ventilation rates occupied spaces depending space type available systems done different ways nad need sto looked case case basis using common sense. Portlander property outside bend. I've avoiding going cause want stay zone speak, big traveling. What's bend like/attitude toward Portlanders traveling there? went 2 nights couple weeks back attitude seemed people care, I'm curious waiters attitude reflective Bend whole gonna burn kill many here. Lots old people especially desert Riverside County. Hot everyday, need AC, service industry obliterated. dumb shit government. ass-backwards.

This become ad people want wear masks.

Actually start ENFORCING rules instead ""shaming"" businesses. businesses already shame. Lol. You’re fucking train wreck. deserve everything that’s happening honestly makes happy it’s happening *you* Fining people wearing masks good way city make money. $1000 first offense probably send good message. Oh noes! RNC! Yeah bunch restaurants/bars opened Friday yesterday already saw close one bars one staff tested positive. knows many people infected. Hardly anyone wearing masks anymore I'm fully expecting last weekend 4th coming we'll get nice big spike shortly.

I'll home avoiding everyone fiance, except drive-in gets good movies. OP (OC? (the person replied to)) certainly utilizing right spew bullshit. government won’t! dont see correlation, takes one maniac car drive somewhere start fire. think ""nothingburger"" virus. Shit coming pipeline since hospitals maxing week Texas, AZ, SC... Perhaps testing less severe cases gotta pump iron. Yes still first inning. Maybe that. Bro, flu - literally case. Drivers enforcement agents. enforce fare either. Speaking major accident, anyone remember hospital full coronavirus patients spontaneously collapsed China right start pandemic? Well 10% pig farmers might antibodys pig farmers worldwide would probably represent     .00001% population You’re making huge leap. dozens pandemic-able viruses China appropriate agencies aware of. That’s job, identify shit get started. We've masks required Portland little bit frustrating see many comply. actually looked online see anyone made list businesses actually enforcing avail. really make sense, know guy always wear face masks still infected corona virus. etc Niceee use internet explorer? don’t think U.S. ever consider “shutdown” again, number meaningless.

3 months lockdown, millions unemployed, etc. everything right back March. Tell me, different shut time? Oh wait, won’t, vaccine. even guaranteed (and take years mass distribute). again, long willing sacrifice people’s livelihoods indefinitely false hope maybe find way hole? U.S. sweet $600 unemployment dries people start wondering they’re gonna get food you’ll much bigger problem hands.

It’s easy call lockdowns you’re comfort home “essential” workers slave away delivering every whim need doorstep. fuck them, right? You’re saving lives! ""I know think you’ve made good points haven’t.""

My points what? even know trying convey? care? life black white too? well thank much. Savings too. even feeling really apart isolation lack family friends live another state wasnt really going begin with. Please clarify felt explain live kind privilege? want understand feel lime made points regarding attempt safe young kids. old anyway kids? work tribal casino. Masks mandatory walk in. 30% people wearing masks correctly get in. walked put mask see take soon pass. one cares.

I say seen 3-4 people wearing trump 2020 masks. properly covered nose well. Fuck trump thanks wearing mask properly. must new here. Ottomans always global superpower. much money, much pirates, much gunpowder, much art...etc  aren't. sucks. deaths, lock nothing. back square one. Give week.. hospitalizations high.. deaths next. lag period stats seem moving target, deaths follow hospitalizations. quicker face music understand 5 million+ Americans likely die (if we're lucky?) said done. quick calculation takes get heard immunity go ahead factor mortality rate (which go imo hospitals reach capacity).. grim. Sorry. :/ Dementia daddy going much better. Mughals always global superpower. much money, much trade, much people, much culture...etc brought toy dickhead BIL asked personally knew anyone died? Maybe not, better hope first one know 71 YO COPD father!! give visibility. Actually early know one way another. think that's meant little ambiguous. key phrase 'is statistically irrelevant', means statistically relevant words big deal. hospital requires patients coming masks. one particular patient weeks ago “trump 2020 MAGA” mask &amp; first really annoyed thinking it, like “omg key getting wear masks” lol 

i’m surprised hasn’t picked popularity amongst crowd, could marketed owning/annoying line w/e don’t care long wear sort mask! nypost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Trying save re-election bid lol Spain always global superpower. much gold, much empire, much marriages, much culture...etc Hmmm one group people believes shit. Honestly would believe stuff listened Fox News 24/7 here. people keep supporting using one main things helps teardown country? would give rat's ass people (btw dozens) say?  Funny that, instead US European country, pick Brazil South Africa.

no one forcing anyone. difficult understand need lot test cases to... know... test? want speed process, there's way tests done Europe, there's simply enough cases. treatment, yes, right. vaccine, needs tested there's chance contact someone disease.

how compare development vaccine trying save them, us, imperialism...? fighting People Brazil desperate reopen country. 

everyone is. honestly, really tight ties Brazil, one I've spoken trials, you? ""...there's confirmed reinfection date.""
-Prof Francois Balloux, director UCL Genetics Institute, China always global superpower. much industry, much people, much armies, much influence...etc US might money throw problem compared nations, well lots top world experts like Dr. Faucci. Trump resisting spending money preventative reactionary measure matter resources handle best used. too. I've worn sunglasses inside outside day night 20 years now. think I've permanently developed light sensitivity. time, I'm one people age still need glasses contacts see, probably something right, hah.

ALSO, get jackasses singing Cory hart's ""Sunglasses night"" time. unoriginal, even amusing anymore. Agreed UK always global superpower. much industry, much influence, much navy, much pop culture...etc like massage meditation.

The fact spending hour getting relaxed self-care space makes inherently beneficial. Ya know what. 

That's fucking scary big brother.

No thanks, I'll chilling Canada. (Or Australia NZ Germany SK Taiwan Singapore or.... developed country outside Trump land) Looks like dashboard get Google search ""Coronavirus"" click statistics left menu. hoax inject everyone 5G vaccines Bill Gates created! America always global superpower. much people, much influence, much infrastructure, much socialist culture...etc live Oregon , still allow people workout gyms without mask It’s expected. still expect 2.2 mil dead it’s over.


Unless actual cure. think manipulated political means. Americans idiots. are, however, drowning misinformation propaganda. Mandates shit though. places mandated, people businesses give fuck. Yes, little. assuming protected others' harm wearing mask dangerous misconception. However, everyone else wearing mask well, actual protection comes in. Welcome party. It’s almost want us desensitized  Hear, hear! last people drafted military 70s now. feel like that's good comparison. THANK YOU. I've trying explain words, perfect.

""Freedom"" means ""freedom welfare state."" really means pay taxes help promote opportunity social safety net need it.

Like, blows fucking mind people opposed welfare state. best societies maximize personal liberties promote economic social well citizens. percentage drop deaths could attributed virus getting less deadly, think bigger percentage 1) 2-3 week lag deaths *starting*, importantly 2) majority people getting infected right younger, healthier people, less likely severe symptoms. 

In state, HUGE chunk new cases traced back bars/parties, seems similar lot states. infections turn secondary transmissions, start see age infected people rise. instance, imagine going surge elderly getting infected 4th July weekend. Memorial day launched initial rebound case numbers, infections simmering spreading last month ton asymptomatic carriers spreading families upcoming weekend. 

If bet money it, I’d guess last week July many states manor crisis mode hospitalizations/deaths. People often forget deaths also follow exponential curve, takes several weeks get beginning curve, really ramps exponential growth. good one. close fucking borders, nobody comes in, nobody goes out.

I joking halfway writing realised I'm fucking serious. Hippity hopity, joke property. ""we may die... die Fat!"" happened virus contained ""pretty close airtight"" dumbass?! remember said back February deputies won’t keeping people becahes enforcing “As done since beginning pandemic, continue seeking voluntary compliance educating public,” 
Deputy Juanita Navarro-Suarez said email.

Doing thing work past expecting different outcome. Good luck LOL Pretty sure new addition older ""theory"" anti-malaria work Africa actually eugenics program. knew would happen since still follow basic protocol opening: testing, tracing, isolating forget fourth matter barely getting first one, let alone tracing. system place actually follow get right. Super cute! Also, username made feel nostalgic ;) Yes, right deployed naval hospitals meant general patients accidentally infected entire fucking crew Covid. Like Hurricane season coastal states cities like Houston example... $900 trillion 45 times US GDP, 11 times global GDP. Great input helperdroid please solve existential dread generation insane conspiracies popping days seem reaction people scared actual threat even able mentally confront it. Instead, find elaborate conspiracy theories delude believing complex web hoaxs secret societies secret motivations microchip is, enslave is, etc. wackadoodle theories comfortable addressing fact actually deadly, invisible, unknown virus sweeping planet killing people millions. Far easier hate Deep State Bill Gates accept terrifying reality

That's armchair psychologist analysis, anyway. clue mean. Yeah, know. article posted every 8 hours. happens I'm going kick Bishop Brennan arse. 15% people Mississippi illiterate? I’m sure follow science Again? Lol idiots. 


It didn’t work first time y’all idiots. learn?


I think probably not, see friend health issues already? That's astounding healthy bad shape 30 getting covid. :s Honestly think field hospital AZ would bad. might comfortable tents providing shade portable evap coolers easy arrange make viable even desert.

*reads article*

Oh. fucking woman head ugly nose mask. Wtf wrong fuckers. Dear fuckers, keep ugly fucking noses inside mother-fucking masks please. get COVID-19 die horribly, stupid motherfuckers. everyone agrees tho. Lol Younger people appear account large surge new cases, many states. Latinos, make large swath state’s essential work force, also recently seen consistently high case counts.

56% cases CA make 39% population.

Nationwide, Latinos account 34% cases race/ethnicity make 19% population.

Cases among Latinos Arizona among several states, Texas, Florida, California North Carolina shown substantially increased rate COVID-19 among Latino communities. don’t know teach people patience that’s comes to. people protesting NYC anywhere else it’s spreading there. It’s continuing decline. 

It’s protests. It’s bars. It’s general reopening state. It’s refusal selfish ignorant mask-up. Muh freedom overrides science (and common sense)  11.6k like 40% positive rate Mask may help enough scientific studies prove it. materials work vs etc. lie study peer review it. Remember giant hornets? People desperately looking doom gloom story latch make cracks awful year is. 99.9% shit never pans out, even read it. is?... definite studies, case studies isolated cases people preexisting conditions. 

You worried disease dissecting motivations media outlets. worst part Americans close minded see bigger picture. always what’s front never actions inaction affect nation. think it’s best tell people needs done BS. need know whether like not. unlikely infection, could happen.....maybe......this new virus literally take YEARS accurate studies make determination like ""you get reinfected 3 months"". Saying virus 6 months old pandering fear, nothing that. middle ground, wearing mask. peoples still don’t want /u/Ariadnepyanfar correct, assumes stronger measures taken lockdown, happy see US finally reacting least. 

The formula works date range. used 7 day date range. Replace sevens sevenths formula another number another range. 

I developed formula I'd happy establish show brief derivation like. 

Take 2 data points, number positive cases world time according John Hopkins 6/20 6/26: 8,673,072 9,822,372. 

If wanted know would 3 days, 6/29, used *linear* interpolation, y\[low\] = 8673072 y\[high\] = 9822372, formula *could* look something like this: 

y\[high\] + (y\[high\] - y\[low\]) \* 3/7 = 10,314,929 cases 6/29 &lt;-- incorrect! 

but linear interpolation would incorrect model use. number grows 3% day, fixed x% per unit time, also double fixed unit time. exponential growth. coronavirus long ago established spreads exponential growth. 

I found following formula works ""exponential interpolation"" will. Using e() e^(x) ln() natural log: 

e(of high plus 3/7ths difference) = e(ln(yhigh) + (ln(yhigh) - ln(ylow)) \* 3/7) = 10,360,431 cases 6/29 

Playing around this, easy prove creates fixed doubling periods fixed percent growth per day. 

So find **day** hit target 1,000,000 cases day? 

e(of high + **day**/7 \* diff) - e(of high + (**day-1**)/7 \* diff) = 1M 

Solving **day**, using target=1M, gave me: 

day = 7 \* ( ln(target/yhigh) - ln(1 - (yhigh/ylow)\^(-1/7) ) ) / ln(yhigh/ylow) 

Briefly: 

e( ln(yhigh) + (ln(yhigh) - ln(ylow))\*days/7) - e( ln(yhigh) + (ln(yhigh) - ln(ylow))\*(days-1)/7) = target 

Using several laws exponents converted to: 

yhigh \* (yhigh/ylow) \^ (days/7) - yhigh \* (yhigh/ylow) \^ ((days-1)/7) = target 

Substitute ratio r=yhigh/ylow targetratio=target/yhigh on: 

yhigh \* r\^(days/7) - yhigh \* r\^((days-1)/7) = target 

r\^(days/7) - r\^((days-1)/7) = targetratio 

r\^(days/7) - e( ln(r) \* ((days-1)/7) ) = targetratio 

r\^(days/7) - e( ln(r) \* days/7 \* ln(r)\*(-1/7) ) = targetratio 

r\^(days/7) - r\^(days/7) / r\^(1/7) = targetratio 

r\^(days/7) = targetratio \* 1 / (1 - 1/r\^(1/7) ) 

I need take ""log base r"" stuff equivalent ln(stuff)/ln(r). I'll use logbr\[ \] designate ""log base r"". 

logbr \[ r\^(days/7) \] = ln(targetratio \* 1 / (1 - 1/r\^(1/7))/ln(r)  

days/7 = ln(targetratio) + ln( 1 - 1/r\^(1/7) ) / ln(r) 

and rest simple algebra. calculator can't take fractional exponents see stick e( ) back solve problem. 

I used ""7"" derivation thought made easier read, see replacing ""7"" ""number days"" day range would work. long rate consistent day range, formula works pretty well. 

I used similar process find ""doubling days"" region: 

doubling\_day\_period = -7 \* ( ln(2) / ln(ylow/yhigh) ) press conferences seem attempted political damage control trying fight virus. Good lord get yourself. would still leave what? 60-70k dead Americans? driving license preparation told answer question ""may"" ""yes""

Besides that: Since main victims virus elderly, might true. Real numbers impossible give. seen articles say virus removing several years average patients life expectancy. 

So yes, average mortallity bit lower following years, wont huge delta, since spread death years. Also posts mention even asymptopic patients suffer serious lung damage - death also occur earlier normally expected. numbers available since still beginning.  see crazy numbers week many? know despite media ppl ICU too. think news ""man leaves hospital 100 days."" common. agenda. I’m paid anyone, I’m 25 year old law student using social media share opinions. Imagine much stupid conspiratorial piece shit lmfao. deaths lag behind reported infections several weeks thus soon know true death rate current infections, think contrast March April, current infections skew much younger, people better vitamin levels. 

Put two variables together, death rate lower months ago. I’ve seen Indiana isn’t weird don’t mask requirements. would need interstate travel Illinois live border everything need closer Illinois. Like closest Walmart like. loved going Illinois pick something seeing mostly everybody wearing masks. go grab something past weekend saw probably 20% mask usage now. guess people don’t care anymore. McConnell whatever convenient preserve standing. Hopefully new administration. failed us. people aren’t known geniuses infrastructure declined. General American intelligence apparently taken hit. True, states inverse relationship belief religion science. follow one, less likely follow other.

Given relationship rest world, feature exported rest world. bad here, people listen orthodoxy country. Slowly, patriotism religion mixing.

As atheist, scares hell (pun intended). disagree. Read article US leadership, pre-Trump, regarding love precision 5%, anyone really knows.  think CVS Walgreens signed pool testing. senate said led Mc-man, said consider stimulus 'see happened first one'

The house could pass this, without senate, goes where. FYI get want tax money either. inb4 people wear inside cars/homes - even single Federal officials young people: “You’re safe virus. need get start spending jump start economy. order help along, we’re ending pandemic unemployment benefits forcing back work laid lost health insurance.”

Young people: “Uh okay, guess I’m going back work since starve don’t reopened shit anyways.”

Federal officials young people: “Oh God killing old people parties beer? destroying America?” happened. Look Mao’s Cultural Revolution. 

That period time, 1960s believe, China’s history country’s leader, chairman Mao, instituted policy called Four Olds. believed bring social equality described Karl Marx, required people suppress Old Customs, Old Culture, Old Habits, Old Ideas. striped private property completely reorganized society. 

I read biography written woman survived it. terrible. 

It’s fascinating read about, I’ll tell ended... mass starvation. Millions. Enough people survived put country back sustainable path. Strange, right? Either virus attracted wealth, everyone else counting dead properly. doubt it’s tied idea economy. tied billionaires making millions stock market, GDP growth. None help poor. *Cries SoFlo* forgot MyPillow. Wow, wonder why. Could be, thousands gathering streets close together?

Rambling tangents, broken sentences pumping statements unnecessarily. wrote rant would read like Trump speech. partially funded USGov, entirely. gather, GOV wanted work drug provided financial incentive - wholly fund it. strings attached funding conduct research. Lol dumb. Remember doesn’t matter type material mask is.  can't stand Facebook. deleted account long time ago. 2016 election disgusted it. What’s related income choosing whether eat exposed virus. focus mortality rate ignores major impact COVID19 still individual’s health ""it damned protestors"". ""antifa!"" I'm Jersey can't believe we've gone crowds looked like past week shore bars. know local hospitals maxed out? work there? yet public CDC people are...doing press conference press conference, interview interview, mask. really want hear them. news, Dihydrogen Monoxide found aid skin rehydration efforts via fluid submersion. considered current administration league Nurgle? wear mask day work, whether office seeing clients community, blows mind people cannot bothered wear one 30 minutes hour grocery store. No, it’s really simple. Even basic google would show France isn’t wearing masks like think, around 10% Paris. countries desperate restart tourism industries opening throwing open doors rest Europe. virus isn’t gone, flare ups over, including hundreds Germany. It’s basically matter time wave rises again. Hey there's someone government might listen possibly, Goldman Sachs. us unwashed masses pointy headed nerd scientist.

Lol sure bars 100000s protestors. Yes trying say. guess didn’t word well. point should’ve spent time lockdown building hospital capacity could deal hotspots started relaxing lockdown. What? supposed remain permanent lockdown get herd immunity (unlikely seeing preliminary studies suggesting little acquired immunity recovered patients) vaccine (unlikely literally never successful vaccine coronavirus)? genuinely curious move forward? People literally going tolerate indefinite lockdown, dispel fantasy right now. meant virus toned down, would've happened proactive. Come Missouri look straight face tell people acting differently. able That’s proven wrong universal. Trolls world tour made much money PVOD. 

That talking point said usually people tied movie theater industry don’t want digital coming they’d lose money. me, article destiles stink ""despite using mask, caught wearing it?"". Yes, wore mask, everything hands, rest people around shat containment measures ""muh freedom!"" nothing. Yes, might worn n95 mask virtually filters everything rest people didn't, means might protected point (the virus could enter example via eyes). honestly baffles wasn’t concerted effort make national push everywhere close across states could’ve big Fourth July blowout.

Part reason America geographically large country infection rates one state another vary quite bit. locking place like Kansas New York peak mean hardship people Kansas without much good. 

What done quarantine worst affected places prevent people entering existing, keeping rest country relatively open, depending severity cases. approach countries like Germany done. hindsight, quarantined New York New Jersey March prevent infecting states. late now, starting Arizona California. Well, know mom &amp; pop landlords (a sweet couple lives upstairs) rely upon rental income help mortgage costs. don’t multiple properties. row house basement apartment rent.

Brought r/Coronavirus I'm saying almost like agenda push. McDonalds also offered free refills time. making coffee hot consume, dramatically lower amount free refills needed provide. really bad example use favor tort reform.

Really always masks public. But, much faith go far. Jesus, thought reading something r/collapse post.  posted unrealistic, though. Sweden seems view COVID chance try something new, different, exciting. Saab pandemics, show Ikea one-off. prove Sweden chief medical officer superior. bad many people die, hey, them's breaks. No. Take Hong Kong model. never fully shut down. Why? prepared SARS. They've wearing masks preventing spread first day reported. contact tracing works. population genuinely cares well neighbors deep empathy others collective well being. Americans that.

So! America reopened early, without plan, mask requirements, population genuinely give shit neighbors, immediately close back down. worse economy? pattern continuous shutdowns prepared caring enough neighbors concern spreading virus makes us cautious everyday lives never fully shut begin series shutdowns? Haha, well thank you!

Soviet Union always global superpower. much money, much trade, much people, much culture...etc Yes, read response, that’s misleading stat. US hasn’t death wave yet, hit NYC hard, hitting south really hard, whereas every area taken hits. We’re past first wave sub 10 deaths weeks now. compare current status US they’ve brought 100 deaths weeks nationwide every region gotten hit.

Then there’s death, ~2k top 6k confirmed covid deaths. look Florida ‘over death’ already something like 4k stopped reporting it. Think that.

But can’t produce masks, PPE, provide citizenry healthcare.

The decline choice. Wow, read article? Novel approach 👍 government executive type universal power.

Decisions like made legislature. comparing averaged death rate across recent years causes mortality. Sweden mild flu season, clearly see SEB's official death registry statistics, current 25-30 covid deaths per day filling gap left less deadly influensa strain Sweden year. precisely reason Swedish media say ""normal levels"" again, blissfully ignorant fact covid still killing Swedish residents rate higher Europe time writing. good way get mold. humidity South constant 80+ right houses festering sess pits. doubt mold helps fight corona. build houses anymore without AC mind. ventilation it.

California's outbreak pretty regional - primarily Los Angeles, maybe bit San Diego. confident positive rate higher isolated metro. San Francisco, example, still relatively contained (if slightly increasing). expect positive rate vary based metro looking at. 

Mind you, Los Angeles huge hardly consolation - metro area alone (not even CSA) larger population 4 states (California itself, Texas, Florida, New York). Well quarter cases deaths US numbers rising, that's bad call part. Remind thought process makes absolutely pro life. Also, get new friends decent people. they're estimating mask mandate would increase mask wearing 15% remember refused call pandemic even decided get rid process calling virus pandemic, oh January feels long ago now. good trend, reversed frighteningly quickly, without constant vigilance.

We need keep fighting there's outbreak all, else progress erased weeks.

See California. No. highly doubt that, we'll see.

Um, friend sharp, huh. state requires masks indoors since March. every state handling like morons caught me, live daddy. also worth noting people get tested free often want Notes briefing:

* Total samples (PCR) taken last week 74k tests. regions approaching 500 per 100k tests made per week, regions higher Jöngköping 1000 Norrbotten 2000 per 100k tests made last week. 
* weekly report week 25 available [here contains information overall results sampling - 12% positive rate staying, increased positive rates age groups 60 decreased positive rate ages 60+ particularly strong decline 80+. also shows graphs shown last week study travel habits. Sweden still -11% travel baseline compared +2% 2019 period compared Nordic neighbours back 20% travel baseline. 
* report includes also statistics ICU care details recovered diseased cases split &lt;70 70+ age groups including week 20. First look shows 3x patients younger 70 70+ (1438 427 respectively). younger group death rate 18% 70+ death rate 49%. 
* Excess deaths week 23 fallen almost normal rate time year week 24 25 preliminary data keeps development.
* 155 patients ICU (on ventilators) COVID-19 (current number ICU register actually 144, mismatch comes register updated different time information reported FHM); total ICU beds country 629, 250 patients sick conditions. getting closer normal ICU capacity. 
* recommendations given people positive antibodies COVID-19 meet people risk groups without risk spreading disease. recommendations published later today businesses performing antibodies tests ensure high results suitable sampling. Antibody testing also follow priority list tests people risk groups 70 years old, healthcare care personnel well.  


**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

Yea, I’d much rather live tyranny suggests wear masks help everyone out. don't. That's pointless. Assuming everyone 10 contacts day, would 15 000 contacts. Assuming tracing explaining steps takes 2 hours people work 8 hours day, would mean 2 000 contact tracers.

According : North Carolina hired 250 tracers (very quick google search get number).

So contact tracing huge benefit, one needs bring cases factor 8. Assuming one achieve reproduction number 0.8 4 days infections. would take little month + 2 weeks measures take effect, month half.

So North Carolina could situation control GOP convention host it.

Of course, assumes lot stuff goes well. One note math probably work Florida. northeast still locked lol. soon open numbers go up. already happening places. least agree opinions pretty worthless.

The rest write sort stuff beat first year legal education.

I harsh except shut lack legal knowledge, rather annoying read wrong thing written person.

Even best times, opinions would fall face precedent. However, national emergency, would find opinion superseded needs moment. personal, understanding legal system historically allowed governments emergencies whatever desire.

Witness Japanese internment camps. Witness patriot act, many, many abuses sanctioned courts due global war terror. Witness courts upholding mask requirements specifically 1918 flu pandemic. fine courts. 

The legal system fine mandatory face coverings quarantines - proof sheer number cases denied certiorari (standing) federal court system pandemic. legal system fine sorts actions emergency situations, a(nother) federally declared emergency since 26th March.

As example guns, arguing example tends exercise mental masturbation. Sticking topic hand, federal government absolutely right mandate face coverings pandemic. state governments, local ones well, provided follow due process law. 

The proof pudding. Florida keeps hurricane season it’s gonna get messy real quick. I'm talking about, live damn idea. thanks this. Yea, sounds right. Los Angeles enforcing much, Beverly Hills fine first timers $100 repeat offenders $200-$500 Ok?

Thanks👍 trump supporters willfully ignorant ban store indefinitely Bring Bubos problem called experts research often times backed something gain thus produces biased results.

Yeah that's what's wrong. think would get fired/sued here. force quarantined something. Donate blood test antibodies (to see use blood treatments) Really? HK government advised wear masks?

AMA reddit said envisioned people needing digital certificate prove vaccination status. Karen threatened it’s common put display cum twattery. Nordborg fails analysis completely.

Every week one could produced similar data show sharp drop deaths, significant lag death reporting inclusion data.

This completely basic level failure, 0/10 points. comes deeply regret virus strains occur everywhere. US spread Swine Flu killing thousands 2009- 'Spanish' Flu also potentially US well (no one narrowed down). strain bird flu also found earlier year US killed birds farm. 

Yes China withheld info COVID first occurring reached world leaders **January**. time act, government failed instead several decided dump stocks knowing going get ravaged. would put past US also hold outbreaks favor keeping economy open little longer. Friday chief physicians western Finland appealed people to avoid making unnecessary visits Sweden, shopping, situation improved. doctors said handful new cases stemming shopping trips across border exposed 50 people Finland virus.

Large majority younger people, timeline fits. 

Yes, outside many wear masks. Many not, quite wear wrong (no help neck, nose). We're subreddit Coronavirus talking people taking Coronavirus seriously, figured would obvious talking Coronavirus.

Why point number people died past decade past century since numbers every bit irrelevant talking about? Lol crazy hyperbolic.

But answer, meant supporting myself, children, family? Yeah course people go work covid throw prison. Don’t let uneducated people ruin country anymore. Let wear prison jump suits don’t wear masks. NJ needs leader nanny. Murphy awful. discover virus take several nasal swabs pig farms around country, part disease surveillance program, even America one test farm animals.

Are sure that?  thought US government cancelled program, three years ago. concerned Good billionaires want run government. I'm talking families separating, too. sister wear mask social distance. 65, immune compromised fine culled, 75 year-old husband. Talking Zoom thinfs remotely good enough her. meet person. husband refuse wear masks around children, ask us take insist hugs. Seeing terms literally putting life line. Seeing terms possibly putting lives children line burdening heavy medical bills possible lifelong conditions. I'm okay that. 

I may love sister, life dangerous family. So, yes. believe may separating families order keep people getting want get it.

So yeah. harsh cruel, someone family willing infect kill children, distance them. sister recovering alcoholic I'm proud her. learned Serenity Prayer her. Basically, says can't control others, control myself. So, let know businesses, people places safe go there. also minimize contact everything everyone else. may think I'm cutting lot, think surprising number people immune compromised immune compromised people lives want keep safe simply want disease possible consequences forced upon them. people lives need keep living. people money kept economy continue stay home. people refuse wear masks, I'm going convince them. also shouldered consequences irresponsible choices. Separation best hope peaceful solution, point.

So, say time separate, truly mean it. 

I realize people agree. Contact tracing brutally inefficient USA. Fifty percent answer phones others refuse cooperate. Contact tracers harrassed threatened. people stupid. freedom virus still rampant. Trump cares make money shortest amount time. Everything else mind fuck right off. He’s got go. Huh? chuck comparisons whole cloth propaganda accusation now? That's even weirder. country Netherlands currently movement/cult right wing voters anti-lockdown supporters. believe:

1. measures COVID-19 work think political plan supress citizens take freedom. 
2. impossible get virus outside. Proof superspreading events inside; 
3. Dutch virus-experts making people scared doomscenario's, mild flu. goverment experts attention-seekers power. 
4. old vulnerable people die cold 'dead wood'. would died days anyway. 
5. problem ventilation AC, cause Covid-19. Look slaughterhouses, churches, restaurants superspreading events. BLM protests busy beaches Netherlands cause surge cases. 
6. Goverments tell lose power want hurt economy. 

It's big thing Netherlands, look bases arguments english research data.

The worst Belgium, Sweden 70% way there. 90% way Italy's tally, 85% Spains, 80% UK's, highest ongoing weekly death rate Europe right now.  Imagine Federal government strong leaders guide population. different would been. Yes, impoverished nations communities people access education hold onto health documents. first world counties find vaccination history look someone's medical history.

I'm sure turned big conspiracy theory. anyone wants surreptitiously discover someone's vaccination history antibody test would accurate way, make easier aid workers dealing at-risk impoverished communities. Sick dad joke right :-) Employee Year study refuse things inside even social distancing place Yup dumbass relatives inviting kids sleepovers daughter. Fucking hell. Yet put reason? headline 4 months ago. Fuck medical “experts” negligent enough public ally saying anything but. can't control it.  political leaders choosing control it. choice. 

We could wear masks. would easy. There's 'they' it. something discovered feel strongly questions fundamentals whole pandemic. Yeah, mentioned like three different parts thread now. Way many people especially young people still think joke. That's course happens loved ones. change mind. finally advised Americans wear masks, advised cloth masks, hoard supply healthcare workers. could done earlier instead lying effectiveness masks. official org (either cdc who, forget which) even went far say wearing masks actually increases chance infection, may persuaded Americans thinking wearing cloth masks time wear one. 

Combine fact fauci penned article New England journal medicine saying thinks covid death rate low death toll turn somewhere ballpark bad flu it’s said done. I’ll forgive one, since covid turn far less lethal initially thought, death rate far exceeds flu.

So yes, people hard time trusting him. I’m fine fauci, think it’s understandable people not. prescription 50,000 IU week 16 weeks chemo. that, dropped 3,000 IU per day. Show ICU Give people time get shit together. Sweden still 25-30% peak death rate covid level three weeks now. even thing feel much education needed. Wear scarf face shop groceries. hard. What's needed person enforces system report punish places skirt rules. Straight fine then. willing lay serious consequences already?! Good luck enforcing it. SoCal wear everywhere. go Walmart mask on. inside many pull nose. leave put back (there guard checks outside). one secures inside, laws useless words. Bon Voyage shall see God, know embarrassing Californians fucking Arizona places beat us punch shit? fuck Newsom doing? Wouldn’t nice idiots affected. it’s so.

Nobody knows sure threshold SARS-2, depends several factors. R0 estimates place, possibility cross immunity investigated etc people apparently honestly believe 1. right wear mask 2. right patronize business want. Taken together, leads conclude business cannot make wear mask pre-condition transaction.

Obviously, people idiots. However, considering fetishistic way ""ma freederms"" treated large chunk US population, really surprise anyone would turn form toxic entitlement. right, probably are. minimize dangers others nursing homes make less half deaths. Oh room people hallways. makes feel much better! /s 5 soon 0. “Discovered China”, already infected half population got public wash summer. Again, evidence masks may effective comes single study hamsters completed one month ago. modeling anecdotal studies well...but let's pretend shift attitudes 7 billion people fast medical experts slow change recommendation despite evidence contrary China. 


The STILL recommend universal mask wearing.  Plus free shot warrant check counting positive antibody test ""case""? CDC, formerly advised wearing masks. hope catch “flu” actually contract flu compare them. Hollowed middle class fat profits goes pockets 1%. Lol sheep. also said trying lose weight.

One things like other... appreciate honesty. Much respect ✊ Better late never, guess? New York, got hit real fucking hard seems like wised quick. Times Square, arguably one busiest tourist spots US, empty past 3 months.

Masks everywhere, outdoor seating only, public transportation still empty. Right we’re 300-400 cases today, might New York State, compared almost 12,000 one day back April

Others could learn thing two north east sounds like Florida change law retroactively suppose so. hour work making masks? love media.

You’re literally arguing economy fault virus contained US. Lol...it's game!!!!!!! Translation: “let’s start slowing spread little governors don’t prevent making us money/ buying things stock market might lowering scares me” Yeah, foster trust participation government. straight lie faces try justify fact.

Even reasoning solid, absolutely way get public believe best interest heart coronavirus common cold less common rhinovirus common cold, primarily transmitted children schools among adult population.

That would mean schools remaining closed could actually opposite effect, reducing populations immunity coronaviruses. I'm pretty confident California statewide mask order. obvious exceptions home, socially distancing recreational activities outside, public shopping Californians supposed wearing mask.

Enforcement issue, order itself. see enforcement ""Open Up"" protests happened lock downs either. Everyone's right protest respected. BLM unique regard. ballsy assumption said past 4 months. would past decade century it? Tru still can’t get tested unless symptoms work vulnerable people.

Not really want to. don’t go anywhere besides house landscaping stores. wonder much better things would I’d say Hillary won? I’m sure would still shit show. Probably would least actually shutdown could saved many, don’t think it’s trumps fault federal response basically 0. Yes, agreed. think say come together key. Take care Responding directly: antibody tests NY studies would detected somewhere around 80% people recovered (or recovering) virus. 26% positive NYC would imply 26 30% exposure virus. Note using NYC serology excess deaths April May led estimated overall infection fatality rate 1.4%, high side estimates. :-( ooh legit legit !!! mean, wouldn’t violate HIPAA? know people HIV positive, employers don’t know (nor need to.) Wouldn’t singling compromised people kind doxx health issues? hope Oregon sees amazing results real world data point rest country. like theory kind people make business wear masks...I think ended place like would catch covid end spreading people somehow stayed locked end May, would much better shape right now. biggest downfall Americans always greed. Nothing new, sadly. random moron Reddit, I'll point [how poorly line reasoning couple months ago. “This utter failure suppress disease countries managed contain real economic costs Americans, fear virus drives people back homes businesses suffer.”

Vote November. AC making anyone sick, lack ventilation places many people spreading virus. still AC car home, places like restaurants patio takeaway service, inside many, many open windows. difficult setting places business work must done on-site can't reasonably adequate ventilation. Like meat-packing plants, spread come surprise.

I'm actually quite annoyed see beaches parks closed, sure risky everyone lock home, actually extremely low risk gives people much safer outlet socializing may otherwise homes, indoor restaurants, etc. Thank you!

America joke world stage years. Obama held back professionalism personable nature, part world hates America thinks guys nuts. Americans really stupidest people, led stupidest president Good! saw mask meme imo perfect. Something along lines of
""Pants uncomfortable. choice, wearing them. wear pants me, wear look underwear"" think phrase we've using long lost mean.

Feds authority. appoint appears ""I think speak."" mean ration hospitals? 

Also, that's exactly argument. country enough PPE ventilators current supplies enough manage national needs health workers. enough current usage large back supply/unused reserve. That's definition prepared. Expecting double triple amount EVERYTHING COULD EVER NEEDED, realistic. USA enough 

 fact much PPE distribute quickly proves prepared considering population density, rapidity spread. Italy PPE ventilators weeks. USA still run ventilators.

As pointed out, problems pandemic hit. Sure, maybe could done beforehand, given amount unknowns would difficult ""more prepared"" countries equal resources capital. react redistribute resources problem. 

While Canada population geography, majority day day life similar. We're seeing little spread, high recovery rates, enhanced tracking, available testing, significant flattening curve. good direction, followed. seeing populous areas start returning new normal cases south border literally spiralling control. 

Similar preparedness, similar amounts PPE front line workers, similar number ventilators per capita. Vastly different results. tourists money. I’m embarrassed Christian American right now. Like really embarrassed. apologize who’ve deal people.I black tho, least one thing going atm. lot people think problems American healthcare stops money, it’s rotten core.

I fainted driving. Felt really sick, wasn’t pay ambulance, drove ER. made fun of, laughed at, treated like drug seeker sent home without treatment. paid $2,000 visit.

Followed doctor told state law requires 6 month license suspension people lose consciousness driving, didn’t believe me. changed story “so wouldn’t lose license reason”

Turns nervous/circulatory system condition makes faint. I’m danger others driving without treatment.

It took 10 years get diagnosis, doesn’t help much doctors mock condition. think it’s silly. 

Many people avoid doctors mistreatment, money icing cake. 
My story isn’t unique, it’s rule, exception. I'm going blunt. far would anticipate would regress one parents teachers dies COVID? Families need travel, deaths, births, live foreign countries split family due Corona lockdowns.

Intentional not. important clarify proves disease extremely dangerous everyone. half die covid19 form nurse assisted care. Qué? Yep wear mask time.  new narrative masks help keep people safe, yourself?  That's sign literally posted door workplace?  

Of course months ago told wear mask all. messages still mixed.  easy enough wear one it.  public campaign fucked public response. may want take look concept called Law averages rule large numbers rule thumb, big powerful countries significantly worse smaller neighbors. Germany probably exception. exactly reason don’t answer unknown numbers. leave vm call back it’s important. 99% time it’s still telemarketer scammer. It’s annoying. oh gods again! interesting none countries worst Sweden, one twice cases April. yourself, son straight says masks work video. Personally, I'm favor prioritizing in-person schooling whatever safety measures proven effective countries already reopened schools, coupled remote options parents comfortable sending kids back yet. Look data, see what's working what's not, give people choices.

But hey, that's opinion parent scientist epi background. we're telling truth masks effective general public lying now? Thanks. seen particularly story provides links sources see info came from. also first time top order come admin diesnt really make logical sense. 

You see numbers John Hopkins check state see % rate is- that's pretty important number right now. 

I live CA I'm pretty upset seem pissed away lockdown time numbers going rapidly, percentage still holding (so far) 5%. Arizona, hand crazy ballooning numbers positive test rate 25% now. Texas also going bananas. Houston running low ICU beds. can't remember read article last couple days state (AZ? TX? FL?) longer allow without symptoms tested.  need get handle actual cases really resources test may anymore. time look right now, though, unfortunately. Basically, order seems primarily punitive based *current* numbers specifically- though like said absolutely counties CA performing poorly. hope get control. 

Thank link. really appreciate it. Hopefully least helped start find looking for. Every day monsoon data headlines. gets hard. I'm sure confused 

Leo Amery, appears, quoting Winston Churchill. That's quote wikipedia bad dipshits setting fireworks live around me. elaborate? Sure, cases going up, deaths going time. Nobody starving, well defined essential workers (not bartenders football players) work contain exposure.

Keep mind developed countries much better US, really shitting bed here. comment completely misinformed. encouraging people take covid less serious should. 
 
The rate significant complications “regular people” 1 5. That’s riskier playing Russian roulette loaded gun. Would that? 

The larger issue compassion. people don’t care kill someone else long they’re fine. No, don’t need sit down, kiss forehead, tell they’re smartest people ever figuring they’re low risk. Normal people don’t need much coddling tricked basic human empathy.

It's also early tell wich strategy better one long run.
Especially second wave hits happens US open again. It’s lot easier blame deaths Covid instead actual cause Denmark also melting pot. cases higher would chose enact PP policy. saving grace isolation rest world (their ability control intake cases).

Thanks, appreciate late, delay still felt months. pointed reality often boring, Rome's collapse happen one day either. 

Rome's century two decline filled raids, wars, invasions, epidemics, economic catastrophes. example, one sack Rome. several. one barbarian invasion Rhine. dozens Danube. 

Point is: America's decline could marked history books year 2200, see now, preceding centuries marked occasional catastrophes. Yeah think conscientious people staying home larger percentages ignorant, entitled, probably less emotionally regulated people right now.

Is reason source omit context? Well let's examine quote. “I press India’s demand 50,000 tons month 12 months concentrated asking 150,000 tons December, January February.

Leathers Winston vehement this.”-**Leo Amery Diaries** Volume II, page 950 understand covers November 10th , 1943.

It written Leo Amery, Churchill.

Well, different source seems could post primary source full (at least full sentence) breeding like rabbits. Well, thanks charge charge. 

My roommate recently lost employer-provided health insurance. Got regular appointment doctor found actually less expensive insurance, also paid monthly wages paid copay on. Um, maybe reopening prematurely, meeting guidelines set federal government reopening? maybe mandating masks help reduce total number infections? We’ve months prepare this, idea acting like unavoidable surprising stage.

When hospitals capacity, people die. people die things covid, too. major part pretty much every hospital’s “surge capacity” plan increased staffing ratios. many hospitals, especially nonunion ones, staffing ratios routinely dangerous levels. know happens nurse many patients? Things get missed, mistakes get made, people die. excuse don’t much faith “surge capacity” plans. I’m nurse, work major inner city hospital. day try make take unsafe patient load day put notice I’m going responsible totally preventable deaths innocent people. mean know probably arrived Sweden early December (or articles speculations earlier last week). know dozens colleagues friends particularly difficult flu season - that's thought was. First time heard friend (after staying home close three weeks) someone needing take pain medications muscle pain flu. late January till early February. 45K new cases one day. accept US tourists either. That's exactly I'm saying Going comments biggest snowflake I’ve ever seen. Pot calling kettle black. proper early non half-arsed US could almost back normal now, like many EU countries, alas... though, think Trump whatever reason people's ""exhaulted leader"", could responded way got board saving lives, instead yet making science reason political stance.... [It's fairly difficult link Uber adoption decreasing studies found DUIs down, studies found difficult make work. mean prepared competent leadership national level didn’t put governors. united message would work wonders. shitshow.

The customer always tolerated. right? Pretty much never. Proven strong word. Trolls world tour made 95 million dollars stream. Trolls movie theater run 4 years ago made 153 million domestic 346 million worldwide. 3 4 times more? no, ""proven wrong."" example two quarantine (especially quarantine stuck kids) hardly proof anyways. 

Not mention got pay 20 bucks stream things rather 8 local theater watch screen 1/40th size? Seriously? Fuck that. Everyone's stuck inside quarantine kids they're willing pay 20 bucks stream Troll World Tour (probably biggest reason even good good theater run). that's ridiculous price think normal circumstances, enough people willing pay make even fourth theater sales again.

That talking point said usually people tied streaming industry people hatred theaters want ruin everyone else likes theaters. get hate theaters, get wait come stream rental like 2 months later. Thanks. interesting see long run. I've using 1% rough number, coming 1.4% ny number quoted lower numbers seen floating around. keep second guessing ""official"" numbers keep seeing floating around (deaths vs cases)are much higher. understand likely many un-diagnosed cases. testing went up, presumably catching cases, numbers changed much would thought. trying get handle much weight (napkin) numbers non rigerous bayesian based guess.

So looking example roughly 22ish %, wonder ""some antibody tests also detect recent infection coronavirus common cold"" 5% false positive rate could much higher would throw 22-26% ton. guess trying narrow cfr solid number (for me, non official use generic internet information) going produce useful number get info.

I suppose long run it'll kind self correcting anyway. deadly moving forward seriously take less people (hopefully) infect, less deadly people ignore get infected. *shrug* 

Thanks taking time educate me. :) killed bad enough, killed death? thanks. Every post spoon feeding information want people eat ignoring rest. honest discussion. 

Yeah it’s “the internet”. You’re troll. ok, serious question - see MANY people wearing mask nose. Perhaps missed biology nose mouth equal access lungs. 

How work people, mean I'm happy least *trying* wear mask, ok say something? would say? saying they're ineffective preventing getting it, spreading it. accurate. Good them. Even masks, crazy Texas letting people eat restaurants outbreak. Meanwhile Russia China laughing idiotic Americans ripping country apart within crying muh tyranny. Churchill believed White Supremacy openly expressed hatred Chinese people Indians imagine Supreme facemasks? hypebeasts would wear them. Since mid day yesterday, I've developed sore throat right side throat. read article 10% covid cases sore throat, could unrelated. freaky. headline sexy RECORD NEW CASES Michigan exact scenario. reopen contingent people right things.

Now tourists flooding country every day. sure silently spreading throughout state. One bar landing churned 100 cases already. sort thing likely happening bars restaurants state. buddy mine coma month soon removed ventilator first time, Look Terror face opened eyes idea going image stick county hospital. ICU also included really odd see blatantly interventionist federal government stock market. Free market indeed! 

It's going frustrating future years see willfully blind speculators fact owe *everything* oft demonized government, vaunted free market principles. No. must lose humanity. must save every single life can. case anyone wondering following countries allowed EU’s 27 members four nations Europe’s visa-free Schengen travel zone: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia EU said China “subject confirmation reciprocity,” meaning must lift restrictions European citizens entering China allow Chinese citizens back considered safe list also expected lift bans might place European travelers. list updated every 14 days, new countries added even dropping depending whether keeping disease control.

Personally, I'd like international borders Canada remain closed, I'm sure I'm happy since requires mutual lifting. hope government plans test enforce quarantine people coming in. help any. Restaurants opened dinning rooms getting amount shit ones require masks eating. Welcome 3rd world shithole status.

We excuse. 15 going do..

Why protestors elsewhere catching it? Maybe reopening scant social distancing Texas? problem powerful people. live different America.

I made point Bill Gates yesterday downvoted negative 20 yesterday stand it.

Bill Gates never anticipated coronavirus response bad lives America things work ways work us.

These politicians emerge praising health care system.

They obtain care hospitals nurses wear trash bags never occur America bad far removed reality. Yep. “Dude, want spittle aerosols? gotta buy dinner first.” (to hassler) Maybe anyone take anyone love cheeseburger seriously? someone locate post post like cutaway view ventilator inserted vs mask side? Staying hell home also fully protects you. show people wearing surgical masks religiously socially distancing got virus. see people went bars concerts funerals restaurants without masks get it. disagree surgical mask provide 100% protection, that's also limit time public, stay least 6 feet away people, wash hands frequently. Wearing mask without things like relying seatbelt save crash, brakes airbags help make even safe. Nah, they'd rather let problem fester government pays fix it. (Which happened) Symptoms. LOVE MEN TELL CALM Well, also means time get results longer 24 hours run. Tuesday mainly tests Monday, weekend backlog. 

Arizona's situation big problem. They're several days get results. Yes is. Stay fuck inside get vaccine comes out. leave home essentials wear mask social distance. feel like study small one area

How less safe going pub / eatery.

The main thing matters everyone wearing masks not.

If gym study everyone keeping masks makes sense got good result tests, every gym keep standard people stop wearing masks / cleaning equipment, whole study door.

This feels like bullshit gym industry trying make people go back possibly unsafe situations. I’m going block shortly, wanted give heads you’re aware really pushing There’s little doubt folks large crowd may gotten infected. However, wearing mask outside minimizes that. protesters movie theaters, restaurants, bars, bowling alleys, indoor establishments may also gotten infected.

The question really whether protests increased infection rate. Based cases places like DC, NYC, Minnesota, look like protesting significant impact covid infections. Social distancing masks us commoners. power get taxpayer funded tests anyone comes within close proximity them. 

"" sheriff said invited event Tuesday White House screened. Though asymptomatic, tested positive coronavirus. ""

 

Meanwhile, work hospital one coworkers got sick hospitalized virus. test us? nope told us wear masks come work develop fever. pictured someone interviewing 100's goat applicants.

I've seen technician use OSHA regulated O2 detector mask exact mask I've worn, I've also seen science teacher use instrument multiple masks results. I've also seen clips others used, thought C02 might've C0 climed 5000 within minute. hey they're falsifying results right? big lie Jesus Christ, dude. Medical workers mostly ones trying tell everyone stay inside. Delete comment making fun crying medical staff. OK your, everyone else endangered, funeral.  Ok. I’ve heard sources ventilator potentially make live longer, chances recovery put ventilator slim none lungs adapt extra support. cases it’s beneficial put patients ventilators. Yeah, freedumb.

However, bf mentioned dad potentially showing symptoms. dad traveling Pennsylvania (Allentown) work NJ (we live NJ) dad mentioned cough felt feverish. said feels fine he's staying attic away bf mom. 

If dad COVID boyfriend definitely exposed want bf anywhere around house parents grandmas home (all at-risk). Besides, probably apartment either put roomate risk, either guess.

I miss bf ton since spent quality time since March. safe see anymore? dad takes test comes negative would safe keep plans pick Sunday go apartment? bf took test without showing symptoms himself.

Look “duckbill” pattern find one extra room nose pocket, apparently room front makes easier people breathe them. also better inhale slow nose exhale faster 


I hate wearing masks - notice got easier something “had to” concentrate instead discomfort masked. wore one complicated high traffic highway drive, going taxes, following recipe fiddly steps. got subconsciously used wearing it. it’s easier work. Nothing helps wear one outside 95 degree heat high humidity though! it. Sometimes data delayed day. necessarily compare us Florida Texas... yes. weird northern California okay LA getting absolutely fucked right now. media tell think, tells think about. Wanna see something dystopian? Check script read multiple local news stations owned Sinclair broadcasting Ok I've told, far right trump loving family, covid results fake dont actually get results recovered, everytime someone tested hospital counts positive test get paid, every press event trump giving speeches people would ask question would say ""fake news"" something along lines family would eat say ""they're trying set fuck fake news""

Like get they're brain dead, sheesh living month see cults formed. point ever hints bringing politics instantly zone shake head yes depending last words come mouths dont anger them. many, there's many immunocompromised people whatnot worth risk. takes one.

To say everyone got sick reckless devastating lost souls died others. “Nah, we’re good here”

&amp;#x200B;

1. ICUs finite number beds, noted.
2. ICUs also ""overflow plans."" means ICU capacity, portions hospital converted ICU beds. usually done post anesthesia care unit, example. Pediatric ICUs may used.
3. even overflow plans fully implemented, another finite resource play - staffing. ICU patients require frequent assessments adjustments care. requires skilled nurse low nurse patient ratios. ICU beds world, ICU nurses help care people them, really matter.
4. ICUs reach capacity occasion. usually happens setting flu season now, COVID. thing keep mind ICUs continue caring people would ANYWAY, like trauma patients, patients big surgeries, forth. added stress COVID patients causing ICUs reach capacity.
5. ICUs try keep one two beds open emergencies, like cardiac arrests trauma.
6. ICU truly capacity, there's patient needs care, may turned away particular ICU. HOWEVER, would entirely unethical patient turned away without arranging receive equivalent care somewhere else. Even someone get turned away Arizona, they'd re-routed like, Salt Lake Albuquerque Denver something.

In Campania, outbreak foreign workers mini quarantine area 23 cases linked outbreak. +9 hospitalized today.

In Veneto 8 cases one potential outbreak nursing home +5 hospitalized general.

In Tuscany 2 new cases +3 hospitalized.

Now last example shows numbers necessarily mean new hospitalizations straight new cases. tuscany 300 currently infected ""only"" 23 hospitalized possible somebody's condition would worsen require hospitalization.

On hand numbers monitored next days understand normal changes due amount currently infected sign undetected surge cases resulting hospitalizations. Oh sure, check publisher message. impossible find masks online March. earliest available shipping date June. Covid contrarians creating crisis convening clueless crowd could cause chaos...  None said problem. (*Even though agree everything said!*)

The problem wearing mask implies Trump wrong. (*He is!*)

And implies something differently solve problem. (*He should!*)

And therefore mask sends political message bunch people refuse send. (*Sigh!*) blame them.. I'm surprised states well may huge numbers huge hot spots. No.

If need ventilator go ventilator die. 100%

People sick enough go ventilators tend die people sick enough go ventilators. Agreed. think people going wear willingly already do. ones might still convinced need different tactics convince.

I’m trying logical feels like ones don’t wear mask don’t understand logic. Different avenues get people though Wear masks stay open American Academy Pediatrics released statement transmission rates low non-existant among children recommend masks middle school age. said teachers meeting teachers much higher risk teacher class maskless children. Maybe mask wearing young kids back due this.
AAP extremely well regarded group. group friends showing symptoms day protest likely infected earlier (we know much community spread happening Texas). wearing masks protest limited many people infected there. fair, outdoors mitigate lot spread. shouldn’t still wear mask you’re crowd, go walk jog avoid others alright forgo mask. Plus it’s probably great wear one heavily exercising anyway- things make hot! tend wear mask around parents keep safe visit.

Fairly convinced tweets, posts, memes say 'wear fucking mask' opposite effect people trying reach/convert. there’s middle class United States, rate home ownership would 10%. buy home, meet criteria considered middle class. Home ownership also one main factors solidifies someone’s position middle class going forward, it’s substantial asset. People absolute poverty afford homes, build makeshift homes empty land that’s owning defined lot house it.

I would certainly like middle class US larger right now, can’t deny US substantial middle class home buying isn’t exclusive upper class. people shitty? lol matter majority certain age group

People bringing shit, unless herd immunity.... like, everyone remember really loud, aggressive obnoxious crowd present early May? know, ones literally screamed “DOOOOOMER!!!!!” anyone saying careful/cautious reopenings, taken slow, done right? 

Yeah. people saying take slow smart. I’ll never understand crowd advocating safety somehow labeled ones “rooting comet” Fox News crowd. current Atlantic MDR SST's like 4th highest ever.

US massively inflating covid numbers financial political reasons. double triple counted cases, count suspected covid cases (no positive test required). go hospital gunshot wound die complications wound, happened contract covid stay, surprise! considered covid death statistic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hospitals get paid US label patients covid. since elective surgeries cancelled ( main money maker) damn right label covid, way make money times slow. Vampire factor think   FREEDUM also think protests, even didn’t spread themselves, made people think okay totally give huge gatherings

In area, reopening protests. Tampa bay area Lib hoax get wear devils mask Q says. Lol what? don’t get say pandemic want be. It’s fucking stupid even consider saying anyone willing wear mask point even remotely justified so. take anger dogshit administration rather ignore advice every doctor expert fucking planet right they’re “jaded.”

Gilead spent fortune developing testing Remdesivir, treat Ebola. got nothing that, looked like failed drug nothing waste money. covid-19 came out, dumped another billion running multiple phase 3 trials ramping production millions vials end year even gave away first million doses made. want fully state funded pharm industry, pursue that, can't expect company invest billions development multiple drugs, one make point sell it, give away cost. 

I know want hate Gilead, reason HIV well managed now. terminal anymore, really inconvenience people it. people high risk groups want get it, developed drug too. reduces chance catching HIV 90%. even working cure HIV, showing promise (still needs work). That's right, CURE. Hepatitis C almost uncurable disease Gilead came out. would slowly destroy liver, either die get new one. released drug cure time minimal side effects. Hepatitis C extremely rare now. Thanks Gilead. also working really cutting edge cancer treatments involve using immune system attack cancer. want keep things, making things humanity, get paid. know want think bunch well meaning individuals make stuff don't, won't. discovery PHD student makes actual therapy cost $100 million more, often fails way. know cancer therapies read seem great, never work end? Yeah wasted money. wear masks, spreading people right thing wearing masks. also considered people might able pick everything relocate countryside? Nothing easy, people work homes there.  cops, tv people politicians wear masks would stop wearing masks? saying other, lesser, people manipulated modeling That's fair. thinking Riverside County, near live. Exactly! government giving tax breaks incentives businesses allow work home drive behavior. many people know worked fine home months forced back cubicles doom. also follow guidelines reopening limiting capacity keeping parties spaced out. agree. sort democracy let's minority decide leader? someone industry friends still working... dramatic. people even tipping well, servers/cooks know close finding new work can. rushing eat right there's high probability give shit staff since unconcerned yourself. course generalisation people respectful many not.

To anyone reading this, encourage patient understanding. wouldnt handling used dishes interacting dozens/hundreds day pandemic low compensation. Remember that. much flush 10 15 times make go down! They're saying it, many people saying it! Yeah ideal viral load, something try take advantage of, isn’t difference.

Looks like it’s something individual key, can’t control support this. Someone even large group people, please show love country WoDeRFuL president...GO HUG HIM! Thanks! /s What’s worse, anti masker liking bacon? Hard decide really. COVID super communicable dangerous not? is, protesting manner done, far spreading virus goes, best idea. really know NHS financed taxes private bankers, what? Americans love paying double drink beers inside beer prisons, even summer little discretion preparation way cheeper, way nicer, way less risk personal public health take shit park backyard. planned ""clean"" wards, clean patients. navy ships never supposed COVID overflow, meant handle non-covid patients, get infected treated car accident injuries whatever. think simple (OP's example).

First, people would denial virus. people know anyone else it, many notified they've exposed. Given everyone least taking *modest* steps reduce spread, really think it.

Second, boss probably thought work really important wanted carry weight keep business moving make sure team able keep jobs.

Third, corporations really crystal clear policy culture enforcement thing. thing know office far they're requiring staff come pandemic. That's potentially indicator putting work return normalcy risk management.

I tend think factors contribute lack self-awareness. call selfish- would call poor judgement. better work culture goes long way avoiding this. im vegan love cheeseburgers. thing vegan cheeseburgers elect spinsters. spin know.  Duh. again, cannot seriously say EVERYONE getting sick right simply reckless condemn death. Yes, lot people sympathy them, however there's many caught crossfire regardless social distancing PPE.

It also government's fault sending mixed signals begin with. clusterfuck reopening, simmer long while. They're closing universities either. people problem, what's even problem disastrous ""leadership"" have.  I'm entirely sure worst American Karens even passports, actually. They're adventurous, world-traveler types. Can't believe NBCUniversal keeping park open. Also Spielberg earns 5% ticket revenue. Insightful correct. Nah we’re talking “ghosts bloodstream” old, heroin respiratory virus, COVID slow burn. get moderate case, could sick 2 weeks. That’s extremely long respiratory virus. get fatal case, often takes month disease get point it’s fatal.

This fairly consistent- Outside nursing homes, people testing positive sadly die going die day two, it’s going take while. seen store since 2019. Good luck. stupid Since H1N1, 2009 pandemic current circulating strains seasonal flu, may relatively mild like 2009 pandemic.

I sure that. [In late reports emerged dangerous swine flu China. Within five days showing symptoms (loss appetite, lethargy, fever), 85-95% pigs died hemorrhagic disease. care people's deaths. 

Inaccurate. act like care people's deaths deaths suit political beliefs. 

Ask four Americans died Benghazi attack, example, get earful single death acceptable anyone questions put death traitor starting Clinton. 

Ask hundreds thousands Americans die COVID, fine, cares, anyone questions put death traitor starting Clinton. risk high restaurants obeying social distancing, bars packed shoulder shoulder, massage parlors open, much worse gym be? /s tougher impossible number visas approved getting jobs would 0. not. hard mean tell someone they're ever going unemployed burden. moved European country would learn language first, move work visa, apply citizenship. Maryland DMV area trending despite reopening 4 weeks ago. doubt unless cases spike It’s complicated universities host people country world . travel lead cases fall . plenty students California Texas school national epicenters virus right . Wonder r going come fall . Semester 5-6 weeks . It’s also hard justify tuition price assume amenities limited gyms cafeteria football games . Also colleges plan lock students campus entire semester completely ignores commuters students . Hospitals California expected surge covid patients early canceled majority elective surgeries, non emergency cardiac caths interventional radiology procedures money makers hospitals.

That Covid-19 pts expensive take care due extensive PPE usage trash waste created care. 

For first 3 months pandemic used disposable gowns we'd empty trash cans 2x's shift. We've since switched washable cloth gowns helped decrease amount trash made.

Other trash waste created covid pts receive meals disposable trays disposable utensils spread food services. There's also giant usage cleaning materials wipe face shields, PAPR PAPR hood (powered air purifying respirator) use.

I also suspect hospitals getting many monetary donations due downturn economy.

At hospital work SoCall, CEO kept saying we're operating $18 million loss pandemic.

But opinion upper management wasted money last 2 years ""caring campaign"" uselessly try change culture hospital.

Overall staff covid unit work super unhappy especially recent outbreak hit staff, high census, higher acuity patients. shitty situation around. understand that. synthetic voice literally speaks you, might easier read faster. Yoi mean projections could happened implement shelter place orders? unemployed people right really 'needed', that's they're unemployed. really 'need' bartenders waitresses, they're nice have. shit. joke. agree except say safe EVERYBODY. 

So many individuals run universities, students. I’m getting soon can. Anything help able live reasonable life without move city farm somewhere. Well shit.... Interesting, difference severe infection even noticing isn’t viral load many thought.

So something person makes difference What's latest news 2020 hurricane season forecast? seen anything since late May predicted 13-19 named storms, 3-6 Cat3+ hurricanes. Remember kids safest age group COVID-19 symptoms deaths.

Considering (in UK), children aged 5 14 1 3.5 MILLION chance death COVID-19, really make sense keep home. (Presumably US stats would ballpark).

Kids literally ave better chance struck We've one pandemic, yes...
What second pandemic.. This. CDC guy good advice, really understand problem. whats end game America? catch what? ones trying contain anymore. numbers keep going up. People stopped giving shit. future everyone kills die survive, survive? Younger population getting infected less risk death. 

More testing.

As long hospitals overwhelmed death numbers rise significantly. ICUs overwhelmed bad things happen. here.... Well according Joe Rogan real, alpha, libertardian males wear ventilators masks pussies. makes say masking reduced R0 slightly? number models seem suggest masking would dramatic impact transmission. can’t take more. doubt citizenship matter, country origin since that's risk factor determining probably infected.

I think better question though 'safe' countries would allow people america stop first place. Im thinking San Andreas fault break ocean day can't separate two. current approach ignoring pandemic fix economy flawed. government wanted fixed economy need national quarantine, ubi duration actually phase re-opening. yeah economic issue they're trying fix without considering main driving force economy: people. problem adults staying put, plague rats moving around deliberately high low risk areas.

There one dipshit plague rat San Diego sub driving hundred miles orange county could watch ocean window.

Not even joking, ocean orange county good enough rat. selfish entitlement rats mind blowing. Sure mostly friendly, also true two countries fought wars recorded history pair countries planet. modern reality mostly ""joke"".... isn't. MANY Danes know genuinely pissed Sweden right call disgusting handling crisis.

You opinons views Swedes Danes view ones others still. automatically right card carrying Swede, come identity politics please. San Francisco surrounding counties really closures rushing open anything. Plus, many tech companies area think lot businesses lot receptive concept working home. developed nation. tried getting blood anyone lived 1918 pandemic. I'm asking great grandmother who's 103; born 1916. blood antigens helpful? Corona enough, shit. Maybe one kills days weeks people wear damn mask.

Maybe end world know it. Maybe Earth killing Human 'virus' savaging destroying climate change, trash, garbage pollution huh? Don’t worry government working hard cronoviruis like:

- banning end end encryption 
- using crisis sell stocks
- going vacation 
- giving billions cooperations oversight 
- forcing reopening make stocks rise short sell (I presume)
- trying stop testing
- list goes on

Wait..... anything profiting.....naw there’s way would (super sarcasticly) reminder wearing mask doesn’t much protect people. protects people you. people photographed always wearing masks makes wonder. 

But again, I’m saying shouldn’t left house get responsible whole time. take issue fact she’s acting like it’s mystery clearly moment, 2-3 weeks got sick around unmasked people. That’s all. Physical, close quarters job. Mask worn otherwise nearly worse cast scenario disease transmission shame one predicted /s I’m sure it’s possible certain restaurants cities. wasn’t even referring 5 star restaurant... that’s regular gastropub pricing city. Let’s agree people different budgets tastes comes restaurants. I’m going get dressed go out, I’m going out. Always make sure communicate things like managers writing. Make clear employee breaking state mandate middle pandemic thank dealing ensuring health safety employees.

If say person, make sure send follow email summarizing this. Put pressure properly manage situation. fully understand trusting media, especially last four years you? Who’s retardant studies showing **too** hot, people gather indoor places strong air conditioning, AC known booster travel droplets, making easier spread virus. words, hot opposite effect people avoid sun exposure 100-110 degrees heat humidity (for instance, Italy banned use AC indoor public places, know would fly US). friend tell bought covcare recently clue reliable website think realize fragile systems really are. People think things splinter little easier hard time reaching conclusions. People act impulse yell singular chant form unified glob. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHA 

AHAHAHAHAHAHHAA

HAAAAHHAAA Let's see. would administration rather help? Renters small landlords big corporations? Right... want blame someone? Let owners blame patrons give damn. People told get reopening going. People told life would fully return normal. People scoffed said relatively small inconvenience. 

Look countries got passed peaks brought cases down. plateaued, down. US citizens uniformly it.

Also, fair, local state government help getting cold dose reality.  fair small businesses? No. none crap ever fairness, unfortunately. That's whole host social issues made worse this.

Reopening adapting done right. American people wrapped self interests see bigger picture consequences short sighted decisions. pay price  Much western U.S. high mountains nearby possible go elevation summer temperatures significantly cooler recreate outdoor environment. announce press conference? missed beginning school reopening talk me. try keep changes missed seeing right away like said, actually US-specific problem. Pretty much every place bad tests circulate, including every country think Europe. Science perfect, science hurry much less perfect. US that's hurry.

Also, again, government testing safety effectiveness. evaluate tests they're given. That's excellent point also climate crisis even harder unite Lol conspiracy argument? I've heard thousands times. Wearing masks = mandatory vaccines = Bill Gates microchips, blah blah blah. get it, ridiculous. wasn’t implying deaths COVID-19 somehow worse WWI Vietnam, deaths per capita comparable. raw numbers. point consider numbers significant even today.

Either way, loss life loss life, deaths 127,00 people unacceptable given make ~1/4 current global deaths, despite US roughly 4.8% global population. callousness suggesting it’s somehow *not bad* astounds me, I’m honestly sure respond suggestion it’s somehow less significant less per capita global conflict... Exponential typically means exponential fined 30k euros put jail somehow better? literaly thing, least got stay home instead jail house.  unsafe get dog groomed using curbside? stage, assume everyone could it. pass dog us? say it’s projected exist soon think Memorial Day. Americans discipline sense care others. We're failed state. large chunk population getting drunk personality trait. Agreed. saw images people 12th century masks on. Yeah looked really weird better nothing. People dead many centuries enough sense wear mask.

So tell 21st century put man moon yet can't put simple piece cloth faces?

During 1918 pandemic see people end wearing masks. one hundred years ago. fully understood viruses all.

C'mon. People. tell ask wife.  Yeah I’m also getting vaccine, autism make powerful. worst case scenario wake one day find turned Incredible Hulk. **This proof Coronavirus racist.** CDC estimated 150000 - 575000 due swine flu I'd like put word Chinese take-out. 

Thank you. ~~theory~~ hypothesis explains many front line medical staff suffer PPE shortages infected higher expected severity rate? &lt;3 same? hard able see loved ones even walk block without anxiety attack. Young people can’t socialize, school isn’t happening, social distractions don’t exist... it’s definitely hard different way. like stay home gas ration able hang walk store without fear...i feel like shaming mental health saying physical important RI NY March Cuomo threatened sue them. Funny happens shoe foot.

For record support RI’s NY’s quarantine orders Everyone cook themselves. Period. Pandemic not.

But scaremongering help anyone. can’t actually survive without money, case one told yet. Life quite literally free. research vaccines already far along instead assuming rushed decide risky not. Oxford slight variation one tested deemed safe pandemic even began. They're journalists, researchers statisticians. job reporting. point trying make exactly, report individuals' experiences? know barely anyone who’s infected still wear masks limit time outside. could possibly say vaccine even exist yet? live 16th population dense country world, nobody wears masks except public transport mandatory healthcare professionals. 

We're relatively well beating virus. Compared US we're amazing. 

It's fucking masks. Yeah lockdowns aren’t necessary happen people don’t wear mask. wear mask lockdowns won’t happen. It’s like literally easy. ""Simple masks work flu colds"" also common knowledge last year.

No one decided ""let's tell lie need preserve PPE."" Look, go protests, oppose gatherings kind pandemic. 

But annoys little people r/coronavirus, knowledgeable covid-19 average person, bothering question premise article young woman says got covid-19 symptoms DAY attending protest. know incubation period disease, right? Thank everyone turns temporarily crossing state, layover self quarantine apply you. What's keep young/healthy people accidentally passing unhealthy/immunocompromised/elderly? point is, letting people go exponentially increasing odds virus spread among young old. minimum, wanted open up, mandatory get tested negative first allowed roam about, everyone testing positive self-quarantine. testing pathetically late country even that. 100k dead already. many corpses willing pile up? Obama installed tracking cameras birds president. They're designed facial recognition. want tracked Libs, wear mask. throws facial recognition algorithm.  think problem logistics due COVID-19, it'd much difficult bring shit China, I've hearing fireworks going past 3 weeks. way earlier usual. really inexplicable. really hard wear mask store? basically saying anyone immunocompromised fault, matter case it? People cancer, cystic fibrosis, elderly responsible conditions? selfish can't handle minutes uncomfortable maybe save someones lives? think people hate restrictions much do? think want things go back normal? Good limits? wrong you? Again, minutes wearing mask can't 6' away someone selfish thing. masks protecting us, protect you. Horrible we're selfish it? Unfortunately perpetuates false notion non n95 mask protect someone getting virus. won’t. Wearing mask prevents person accidentally spreading it, even imperative everyone comply. makes wonder quantification one needs write reuters. I’m saying experience, seems unless bleak terrifying, people resort hateful. get it, go masses. free so. instance, California less deaths Canada, despite larger denser population. addition Coronavirus? &lt;3 Florida closed bars ""backlog issues"" conveniently right 4th july weekend. 

It's gonna fucked August thanks govenor douchesantis. I, too, believe random anonymous reddit comments interviews emergency room doctors. massively disagree part said? There’s different things could see agreeing disagreeing simultaneously. disagree assertion citing dictum proves ignorance. Much legal understanding comes judicial opinion, contains examples may directly part case, relatable way (i.e. represent idea). case article cites, claims overturns “crowded theater” opinion requires imminent danger. Shouting fire crowded theater would reasonably create imminent danger thus example would still hold up. Part reason write majority dissenting opinions future judges something build of. overturn case building dissenting opinion, doesn’t invalid points original majority opinion facts case differ slightly. Yeah, *else* though? getting vaccine hurts others helps yeah, go hell. care Karen manager slayer, NOBODY deserves this. virus, killing one person many. :P could know? Sweden barely started test. Brazil needs. yes, need new Subreddit, without annoying bots, automods etc,, rarely come now, (first time 4 weeks) like power trip here, lost interest posts removed etc one made system it’s MANDATORY to; reserve space, come equipped equipped mask upon arrival, sit down, food pre-prepared restaurant already expecting dine-in order, staff focus dining room expecting customers???? Seems like good software develop dine restaurant apps.. like compressed version climate change crisis. What? think protesting San Fran?

I'm sure protests contributed increases seeing, outdoors many/most protesters wearing masks. 

Nobody honestly looking data intersection points protests pin new surge cases protests. crazy protests places like Houston Phoenix Jacksonville, Fl? Fairly mild places getting absolutely hammered virus right now. Ok, I'll wooosh myself. Thanks. cant really lift house, Weights skyrocketed price since lockdowns started. happens I'll stop trying short market. Well you’ve said going read article. find lot scientific understand admit usually read headlines! Exactly this. I'm enthusiastic vaccine advocate. I'm going first line rushed vaccine, approved federal government gives shit market. [I thought article pointed actually showed measured blood oxygen saturation case, instinct concern. appearance expected close normal (100%). 75% – level barely compatible conscious.

Low blood oxygen level symptom, obvious. Europe exact position Sweden 3 months ago - facing 'pandemic' without immunity. 

And completely incorrect many European countries making masks mandatory - less handful done this. made mandatory limited cases public transport, made recommendations only. 

Whether understand anything irrelevant. OH COME Exponential growth powerful thing. Insults always way go aren’t they. You’re one mentioned first place, maybe issues work out. Keep staying home meditate it, maybe won’t hateful 💕 hopefully we'll new leaders White House Senate helping make rollout (and subsequent economic recovery) success. Keep watching dark read anything it. got twists turns blow mind. Glad enjoying obviously recommended cloth masks prevent people buying surgical masks hospitals need. new studies came showing cloth face masks work, one CDC believes work either. seen photos lab scientists Wuhan? bandana worked filter virus multilayered tyvex suit multiple respirators face shields.

[Just look guy tater pickin' season. Exactly saying. mom died one, traumatic even see put in, let alone taken out. It’s real hard sometimes take ppl them. Mask homies Pitter patter an' 'er 
First search engine hit. even need restrict first 3 months want people wear masks today, like do, stop gaslighting media saying help helped indirect ways. reach herd immunity faster then? think salads would worst. subway sandwich places shit sits day. Chipotle comes mind too. way keep shit clean day cousin used subway manager said really cut corners long keep shit is. Hi there, already posted taking repost.   Sweden’s strategy herd immunity. 

You're good citizen, learnt lesson well. fully agree you. Back 2009 never confirmed H1N1 positive, doctor basically told likely it. would 15 - 16 around sick ever been. Fever peaked 104 - 105 it’s hard describe felt (basically felt like floating). Thankfully recovered long term issues (that I’m aware of). One neighbours street also passed away H1N1. Definitely something take lightly. “Just flu” still fun. purchase account ?   
Are bot ?    
A 12 year old account low karma appears recently used single issue bullshit ... signs it.   
Beepbeep ? Maybe landlords make them. Oh wait, lol million dead Literally one article arguing that. Oh Jesus fucking Christ ... No. Los Ángeles highest amount cases US. 

It’s mixture different elements. Honestly reading article explains lot better still cases connected food vector disease? sounds like mindless panic, I'm saying someone almost never gets takeout work restaurants.

The bigger concern empathetic one workers spreading among rather spreading you.  think humans different chimps something it’s safe chimps unlikely safe humans? 

Because *aren't* chimps. Pretty simple.

But say makes something developed use chimps would ""unlikely safe humans"". insinuated anything developed use different species *potential* unsafe evolutionary terms that’s lot time all.

In medical terms, eternity. I'm counting evolution deliver vaccine. I'm going medical science that.

 even evolutionary terms, long enough significant biological differences develop species Chimps. Biological differences could medically significant safety and/or efficacy vaccine, not. know unless rigorous scientific study conducted. can't humans chimpanzees closely related enough human chimp could probably produce offspring.

And yet, never happened, even scientific intervention. That's 1.3% difference might mathematically insignificant human minds, obviously extremely genetically significant nature. 

Humans chimps can't interbreed genetic differences enough that, starters, different number chromosomes chimps. Thus attempts hybridize species results rampant aneuploidy within cell divisions monkey men thing, despite Bugfoot enthusiasts would like believe. Congrats I'm happy able get out! know forever, years till finish school job training. That's good know. Thank you. That’s something shady scientist WOULD say! Thanks TL;Dr Pokémon! Careful, tell hospitals near aren’t packed maximum capacity you’ll get voted down. last three places open, order: restaurants, bars, schools. Gee believe administration lies every single day medical professionals... Yeah, nevermind, plan. Well then, guess I'm better killing myself, intention live thru world getting destroyed climate change mother pandemic amazing thing doctor thrown hands said ""fuck it, let kill themselves"".

How big heart try hard save people determined kill others stupidity. Hopefully he'll new, much supportive boss come January 21st. lol me. Thats great chart though, know source website it? sites track graphs like calculate manually. Yup that's key here, case numbers earlier year testing enough pick up.

Antibody tests show NY actually 10 times number confirmed cases immune systems beating Tcells alone antibodies real number even higher.

If current test results freak out, know looking at. Without data. literally fan fic 80 upvotes. fucked sure, positivity rate around 7% today normalize data. April 20%. way steer policies U.S. : showing lucrative path. week ending 6/13 2014-2017 average CDC cause fatalities 52126. cause fatalities week year? 51880. boss like this. Guy smart enough see reason explain things logically, trying get faux news brainwashing tough hell. American never thought Italy west. Swine flu circulating China least year killed half pigs China. (That's fact know).

The thing sure whether swine flu mentioned article same/originated flu mentioned above.

Anything know sure labeled it.

Calling propaganda correcting anything extremely weak argument. gladly admit mistake wrong sure thing either. Looks like zero deaths due ‘data cleaning’. 
How tuberculosis impacted mobility? impacted respiratory function all?

Please read let know choices stay home equation? could really use advice I’m seeing need yearly check ups heart transplant keep healthy(yearly tests, including pulmonary stress test, cardiac cath). need blood work every month. make enough money groceries delivered, entertainment paid for, can’t avoid going see doctor. can’t avoid face face nurse drawing blood. can’t breath machine might coronavirus I’m pulmonary stress test. can’t tell dr put cardiac cath jugular vein cause that’s close face makes uncomfortable close face breath 30 minutes measures pressures inside heart.

 Miami Gardens Cop Arrested Charge Battery Pregnant Black Woman

📷[Nicholas news reporter Forbes, primarily covering U.S. South.Updated Jun 26, 2020, 10:27am EDT

TOPLINE

A  recently fired Miami Gardens police officer shown  graphic video January holding knee pregnant Black woman’s  neck tasing multiple times stomach arrested  charged battery official misconduct, Miami-Dade State  Attorney announced Thursday.

The  officer, Jordy Yanes Martel, seen video dragging   33-year-old Safiya Satchell vehicle putting knee   neck stunning twice Taser, Satchell   screams. Cant really contact trace US doesnt trust government. I'm reminded ""Kingdom Heaven"" Knights new King one says, ""God Wills It!"". 

I guess case, ""God Marriage!"". least, 3 days work sick, get doctors note/... well, one thing list things falling short. shocking someone driving yell walking work yesterday mask still on. I've given trying get groceries town stores full anti-maskers looking fight. death cult everywhere now.  people need support go support THIS? KNOW THERE'S PANDEMIC GOING ON?

Getting real tired hypocritical fucks want people unemployment. Miami, rest South Florida, never even thought reopening since barely got cases control. I'm Michigan, schools suck, home schooled kids anyway. Lots friends asked get homeschooling, expect stick it. Obviously believe superior public schooling. permanent version public schooling via zoom, might consider couple days week, mostly cooperation skills opportunity live lab experiments. clear think teachers mostly blameless suckiness public schools, mostly mismanagement government. Teachers resources available education make hell lot money, everybody working class should. sound bitter black people sick protests  White collar next. Karen alert. Funny entire time, places even going back March open now, 2 cases could traced gyms area South FL 30 mile radius.

But oh lawd, god forbid 5 people bbq. thousand thousand protestors allowed closely gather scream yell droplets left right that's ok according media left/libby-wackadoos. Oh shit, wait, can't even ask participated that's allowed b/c racist, offensive rights.... oh rights..... Lol NY, believe stories well...  legit think frontline healthcare workers going PTSD this, especially ICU workers. horrid things see day day along people dying, sometimes absolutely nothing doctors even save them, got taking huge mental toll them

Why oh world governments shown consequences virus video pics scare populace action.

I watched videos nice viewing makes think differently.

A Churchill like response proper address relevant nations might get better result ""everything ok"", might get little people respond cause nothing else seems work. Florida county. 700 new county cases per day month ago 9,585 6/27. stingy water fire licking ceiling. Special Meeting Tuesday, Brevard County Commissioner Bryan Lober released statement support mandatory face mask Kristine Isnardi spoke mandatory mask policy citing inability enforce 50 residents showed speak meeting issue speakers voicing opposition mandatory face mask policy. Considering possible consequences infection, difficult understand people exercising caution. like playing Russian Roulette you, family, friends participants. I'm even sure much making justify continuing operating like that. went restaurant pick to-go order, handful people there. pandemic place always full. American issue btw. I've completely lost faith people  It’s unfortunate fauci made initial responses masks effective I’m sure makes lot people doubt asked questions models referencing. yeah let's pretend one party death individual tragedy, death millions statistic. death toll rises always lose fear horror Ok thanks yeah thought going crazy. know it’s still high little reassuring it’s 20% today. [Here’s graph found normalizes case data include testing Chill out, Thanos. It’s small businesses feel singled out. restaurant serves alcohol still inside occupancy. bar serves food closed Yeah know realized made mistake math earlier ive updated comments reflect idiot am. correct though, positivity rate currently lower. far (where am) none contact tracing (and hit ~500 cases yesterday) points protests. able make first contact close contacts someone positive within 24 hours 95% positive cases. You’d think would show now!

For community outbreaks frequent place outbreak bars restaurants. F would anything love, won’t surprised too. aware vaccines sometimes work less well older people. speculation announcement younger people would get vaccine country would open - happens elderly people co-morbidities protected anyway re-join society. guess see advantages approach too, especially health care workers. Right? Face masks scary!  Yeah too. I'm work right hospital. opened ICU covid beds stretching staff higher ratios. can't keep up. doctors taking many patients, sometimes call rooms patients able keep oxygen phone save time. Gotta vax em testing, better treatments, younger people getting infected Thanks info! problem right/left pretty much rural/urban. Can’t split evenly. think need city-states. I've seen young kids snot literally screaming nose/mouth/chin. Carrying wad paper towels, heading class. fall semester looking extremely doubtful point. got carry couple times. shit. many people actually need ventilators? heard like pandemics I'm Houston fucked. People care. instituted mask rule bus that's lasted 1 week. bus drivers already tired fighting people wear mask even though handing mask. people literally take mask talk people. lot people Houston care. They'll care get it. it'll get views Instagram put PSA coronavirus real. got money. That’s care about. Cry babies Ah yes, citizens united definition personhood suppose handle someone arrives hotspot state without anywhere particular know they'll able quarantine? So, anyone interested measures South Korea taking. 

The US things.

It much worse here. floats tho? They're die for! ok, well lets stop interacting china on, seem really good this, creating new deadly virus's thing happening. Everything told would happen nothing Yep. Here's hospitalization graph yesterday. :( really hope goes reference pricing lower Ebola? pricing US Africa? Woo-hoo!  heard guys west influx people coming east beaches open they're closed miami ft Lauderdale. guys letting happen? US, positive cases trending younger. That, combined reputable/minor treatments found, probably contribute flatline fatalities positive cases skyrocket. 

Hospitalizations still going though and, hit max, better believe fatalities start jumping too. sample size 7 deaths Shanghai way small try make kind conclusions mask wearing. time Wuhan locked news spread new pandemic, sure mask wearing darn near 100% everywhere China.

I think make kind conclusion mask wearing based Wuhan's data either though following reasons

1. time people ware virus, China gov't quickly hard lockdown whole province. Masking really matter noone allowed outside anyways.
2. Data China always suspect. take China's number face value, Wuhan's outbreak small comparative US European countries. Wuhan amount cases Arizona right now.
3. time people realized new virus loose, virus probably already infected significant number people Wuhan.

I think better study effectiveness masking would look South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Vietnam. Though teasing thenet effect masking vs strong contact tracing program would difficult.

EDIT: found youtube video Wuhan 2 years ago. see masking common day day life.  ABSOLUTELY correct.  rate conflation case numbers like see Texas County meeting , admitting this

video 

Texas’ new guidelines count ‘probable’ Covid-19 cases could artificially inflate state’s number, Texas judge warned.
Once guidelines came place late May, Collin Co. Chris Hill said “the potential significantly artificially increase case totals.”
His entire statement worth reading, here’s key takeaways:

We'd much better Abrams... mean covid warning what's come? mean long tail profit healthcare industry! good economy. /s Yeah, pointless criticizing Sweden. Clearly whoever posted agenda. That's least hope for, yes. would hope artists would also realize terrible optics refusing attend. say Average supposedly 5-10 mean that's kinda bunk hard take average consider vaccines fastest (measles took like 5) diseases number like never, take HIV. include 40+ years aids research averages? Dual citizens always able come borders. I'm huge fan people coming saying traveling Alaska going around like normal new COVID-19 cases risen every week four straight weeks. part increase attributed 9% expansion testing, health experts also worried states relaxing stay-at-home orders credited curbing outbreak.

You can't open Pandoras box peek put lid back on. United States saw 46% increase new cases COVID-19 week ended June 28 compared previous seven days, 21 states reporting positivity test rates level World Health Organization flagged 7% diagnostic tests came back positive last week, 5% prior week, according Reuters analysis data COVID Tracking Project, volunteer-run effort track World Health Organization considers positivity rate 5% cause concern suggests cases community yet positivity test rate 24% last week, Florida’s 16%, Nevada, South Carolina Texas’s 15%, according analysis. real concern. start seeing people 30s like recovering months months ‘wave’ caused folks age gathered bars protests. People ‘decent’ job stuff shut down, done horribly opened first thing said thats actually right  face value accept point view. consider science based individual. said, track record federal government beginning natual disaster (sorry, war) made extremely distrustful.

Right, low-risk groups quarantine. theyre low risk. hard. Assuming talking low-risk people test positive, where's evidence that

ICU hospitals may currently capacity look admissions, going up. Death lags way behind ""Nah let's see plays out..."" True Narcissistic Personality Disorder another epidemic affecting US right now. making Covid 19 much worse. many people grew middle class safe parents safe neighborhood.

It's like can't fathom life like poor, inner-city kids.

When school start, bet lot kids end missing one ever finds them. Parents stressed already abusive notch. ik one answer question things go back “normal”. Like guys think US economy fully open person classes universities resume? think beginning 2021, things go back “normal” guys think take lot longer? swab nose—it thinner tapered q-tip, went deep.

I’ve never flu swab, though I’ve diagnosed flu. (Bedridden 2 weeks time, sickest I’ve ever been.) imagine it’s similar?  It’s doesn’t like admit wrong. ego, makeup gets way. around Chicago every day work, I've rarely seen someone enter buisness without mask. couple times I've seen they've turned away. Possible probable. Looking massive shut downs gets high. approved yet can't give randomly globally. even know many people vaccinated give size Chinese Army supply vaccines, probably thousand most. number hospitalizations ""being misinterpreted,"" said Houston Methodist CEO Marc Boom, ""and, quite frankly, we’re concerned level alarm community unwarranted right capacity care many patients, lots fluidity ability manage,"" Boom said. important thing timing widespread cases US time recommendation. masks serve primarily prevent infected individuals spreading others, I’m okay statement. testing infrastructure abysmal, didn’t know widespread things truly goal prevent run masks, leaving medical professionals without essential supply. make sure one population best prepared fighting outbreak, it’s going people whose job come face face infected people. Inconvenient is, I’m okay restricting lifestyle lieu mask. Healthcare workers don’t luxury.

We saw happened with: toilet paper, sanitizer, masks, etc. We’re shit nation prioritizing, people lied people knowledge need could prepare make best had, it. People used grift current administration hard fathom still exist people within in, namely Fauci co, may still trying good. wrong?

There enforceable national seatbelt law cannot enforceable national mask law okay mandated employees. able needed shopping telling employee walked couldn’t wear one offer doctors note needed. that’s it’s state mandate, won’t let offer curbside. means I’ll pay pickup fee get groceries *tonights* dinner week.

Check county see counting ‘probable’ cases cases. hate say this, probably narcissistic. simply human behavior something we've seen past pandemics. Humans proud like show weakness. many, admitting virus problem akin admitting afraid. words, might see selfish act, simply one response feeling cornered. psychology actually incredibly interesting. seriously, call people narcissistic find actions selfish. two different things. make us look good NC


Except, there's tons people going vacation/give business rules we'll see. frustrating absolutely correct. People can't hold two complex thoughts head.

We complex thoughts. sign maturity. Gotcha. swine flu 2009 I've never felt close death before. remember sitting shower vomiting shitting almost hour. Oh sure! Definitely referring him. hard imagine. live San Francisco 100k/day would equivalent entire city getting sick single week. can't imagine entire San Francisco full covid patients created every week. There's upper limit imagination empathizing. imagine bad family got like 20 sick single party feels, can't imagine 5000 every day. all. Fine dining would 300-400 per person. SUB SAID VIRUS WOKE IMPOSSIBLE CATCH VIRUS SAY “FUCK POLICE!!!” look overall performance across world, lot confident about. 

We poor countries like Vietnam Cambodia deal pandemic well rich countries like Japan Germany. densely populated countries like Korea well sparsely populated countries like Canada. cold countries like Norway well humid countries like Thailand. 

So suggest types countries potential address problem. give confidence rather less? that's thing. lot restaurants curb side only. people *need* sit restaurant. I'm bartender 7 coworkers restaurant gotten covid. closed 3 days opening back tomorrow. Nice try, bruh. stupid. can't grunt COVID out. That's big tin-foil hat something worth posting r/conspiracy

""Never attribute malice adequately explained stupidity."" EDIT: layover passing northeast states considers ""quarantine"" worthy zone self quarantine. 
\--NJ 211 6/30 350 p est 

I’m NJ resident. flown Denver June 10 3 week job. I’m flying home tomorrow. However, hour layover Texas airport. NJ/NY govt announced anyone traveling Texas must quarantine 14 days arriving NY/NJ-while already Denver work. Denver/Colorado aren’t list.

Does anyone know check guidelines turn question? Maybe Cuomo Murphy Lamont event spectators. that's thing US Open Novak Djokovic getting virus  False Pride comes fall... State police?

National Guard? come risk, outdoor activities reduced risk indoor mass gatherings.

A lot outdoor 4th July events may largely spaced often lines food things, people still get close together. Bible plagues based real problems people back had. Locusts new. Trump would give nickname.

&amp;#x200B;

here's one: extinct Good luck Denmark. mean 30% export Sweden, US Uk. really, claiming deaths disruption reactions virus, economic social, almost certainly steal life world virus itself. definitely agree, wasn’t completely informed studies popped r/coronavirus took stroll r/covid19positive speechless. Considering USA lower ""deaths per million"" France, Spain, Italy, UK, Belguim, Sweden think US done much worse?   restaurants area even ones open dine closed fountain drinks sell cans sanitary reason. Except ""fact"". protests spread virus like ones earlier did. Fuck every single one people. crystal clear value $ public health, safety, lives. Come guys, superficial analysis. Cases per million California even top 25 US: #29 cases per million, also #29 deaths per million.

Raw numbers worthless, make great headlines.

Edit: see cases throughout country, number deaths per day US lowest since end March. going want check math again.

That would 1m 10m 250m get it.

On top lose 650k year heart disease see people shutting economy fight it. Unfortunately many newly infected young less likely die. Plus ill people coming sooner treatment, lessens odds dying. Well, think foreign born residents over-represented Sweden? exponential growth, enough little bit spread kick off. Oh no, I'm Ventura County, California. That's right, remember quote now, ""Give Death give Nanny State Death"" shouldn’t be, helpful. highly recommend it. reach need someone talk to. concern food handling may incorrect. know certain either. stating something fact--""Takeout safe"", give us source takeout food cause spreading event. unsafe? 

I've worked multiple restaurants, heck anything? really do! 

I bored stuck home. really research. expect get big, planted couple things close them. 

They look healthy veggies yet. get close blueberry bush going something.  found article pretty insightful. Obviously protesting puts people risk, causes businesses close people stay would otherwise, mitigating factor spread. SWM member lonely tribe. bars bowling alley's for. 

don't think one. milliions us. course ought rectify situation. 

if atheist would go church. ""The US"" thing regard Covid. I'm Illinois busted ad invested sourcing raw materials testing. 

The states different Washington, IL, NY, MI Florida Texas. 

There US response. states own. people beach endangering lives protesters same? Fatality rate shown rise hospital capacity runs out, many infections, number deaths would likely much higher. bro people dying. people dying knowing could potentially done prevent staffing resources. watching dozens people die week may lived decades longer catch virus. sending mother C section knowing never meet baby. shut fuck No. like Sharkicane 1, side coronavirus. impinge personal freedom. That's opinion thats fact verify looking definition personal freedom. want wear mask thats bro. get tell want illusion safety though kids die flu 10 times rate coronavirus, still very, rare. Kids ones advocate coronavirus.

It's serious disease turns out, adults pass other. 

The kids giving virus teachers parents. really believe science anymore? learn new things get new information? ban cars? Cars kill people. saying let people die cars? ladders? need ban ladders people fall die. care people dying? Even proper training medical professionals proper PPE (not masks) fall victim cross contamination infection. Common sense enough. well Colorado.. We’re getting nervous Illinois too, aren’t “hot spot” love party American exceptionalism switched ""not worst world fine"". Literally got phone Planet Fitness trying cancel. COURSE pain ass it. 

I asked, ""So, want cancel membership want COME INSIDE establishment pandemic - way - COME INSIDE?""  Meh, least Japan Korea, dining open also great. That's measures, like masks distancing, nobody Covid-19 can't spread Remember lining elementary school walk recess everyone quiet? couple kids shut hell missed recess? That's - except death count.  ""but people love insurance"". fuck that. like healthy feel like getting raped stay healthy. Fuck anyone profits others access health care. Currently, US public places risky hell. 

Though, Norway recently reopened gyms found increased risk, long people followed rules restrictions. again, Norway coronavirus control 9000 infected since start outbreak. needs option 1. Remote learning 2. site limited student population, masks, eating lunch together. done cant teacher things. would mean reshuffling teachers one focus distance learning vs site. Unfortunately, we're US schools abysmally funded. Yeah idea masks cause organ damage absurd. like saying get organ damage sleep sheets face. America lol thing really spread much slower summer talk reopening? I'm winter south big city cases started spike lot soon little relaxed (still shops shutted down, open sectors work appointments restaurants work delivery). cases since end summer, almost every one time people coming back vacation northern country, proper data contagiousness slower. Hey uh, Canadian here. reusable masks pretty cool. hope help die. Cheers, [The Kindness us americans self-centered. whole world fucked economies killed thousands citizens make trump look bad. Omg nightclubs water parks smh Stubborn Mule mean anything ? Also: apparent decline cases mortality Quebec mostly due fact elderly massively dying nursing homes better care now. community spread still going strong hospitals still receiving lots (younger) patients. according friend works healthcare system there. decision open everything motivated desire give people bit respite inevitable ""second wave"". many people still refuse use masks.  Fucking hell. religion get special dispensation? think god backs? gods will. Blah blah. Use fucking heads, virus doesn’t give fuck worship Came say *exactly* this. Someone left empty tub turned label inside read ""Swine vines""

I ""Quarantine"" sticker door office caution tape taped around it. worked electrical contractor guy time thick skin work there. Great group folks though 10,874 people Waynesboro, PA. national death toll Covid-19 12 times borough's population 40-ish times deaths 9/11.  Deaths shows US EU roughly even, EU bit higher peak, US much longer tail off. 

[Graph weekly average deaths US looks like we're leveling around 5000 deaths per week, far EU currently experiencing. time tell that's truly levelling off, curve changing increase. Recent data hospital bed usage places like Texas paint promising picture though. Well that's fucked up, want reusable mask rainbows it, got em here. [The Kindness Minnesota: [June 27 update COVID-19 MN: Number confirmed cases climbs past graph interesting. Shows age group 20-29 wide margin fastest growing age group new infections. 0-19 also way up.

If trend found across country, might part explanation death rate keeps going down, infection rates go up. I’m confused math statement. 50-100% cases? 50? 100%? somewhere between? makes sense. already people unfriend Facebook sharing news story. I’m sure they’ll Capitol tomorrow. absolutely intentional. GA-27 (June 25th) order specifically mentioned halting elective surgeries four major counties, superseded GA-23 (phased reopening process). body order GA-27 states nothing halting phased reopening end it, simply excludes GA-23 list orders superseded GA-27. Stating body order directly, would mean would admitting fault, can’t that. 

Judge Lina Hidalgo everything can, within rather limited scope power, try keep Houstonians safe. (I proud able say voted her).  Aren’t bar managers knuckleheads case Invasion Body Snatchers real!  Nice try. much Bill gates paying get us 5g microchipped injected chemtrail concentrats? Earths flat ... Peace. Fluoride first surge end ""second surge."" Or, death rate decreased, maybe they’re really worried impact kids missing crucial years socialization, jobs, mental health, etc.

Sick oversimplification opposing views framed sub. course 50 upvotes. now... politician gives shit. Im going 100 guest wedding July OH. bride said tables least 6 feet apart you’re still sitting 9 guests table. dance floor going markings signal stand/dance. really odd me. this, shouldn’t wedding. course, gyms shouldn’t open first place. point it’s becoming harder harder go anywhere without encountering majority people wearing masks need unified front instead finger pointing people masks. Yeah they’re protecting enough everyone needs wear them. we’re gonna close risk businesses need start enforcing common sense. Totally relieved business networking group dick hard jumping holdong meetings indoors again... single units restaurants small AC units simply take surrounding air, cools it, ejects high velocity. drift comes infected a/symptomatic contact high velocity air propelled go multiple infections. 

Im assuming work commercial building large dedicated AC units. works fairly different. Ill try ELI5 also onlookers here. big buildings large AC pushes air throughout entire space. Sometimes floor. Sometimes multiple floors. air brought diffusers (above head typically) enough push mix air around room (think gentle stir). someone breathe space, droplets carrying CV may float bit eventually float floor since strong suction strong source air propel particles like that. long sudden quick movements like running prolonged close contact proper mask use little* threat. wouldnt like restaurant situation.
And situation would comparable walking outside. Since wind exists everywhere (assuming stormy course regular day) push stir particles around anyways many directions yet people still prefer go outside indoors.

Could explain get little technical that. would try squeeze WFH long can. Idt states real solid reopening plan get people back smooth manner. 

Above safe everyone take care! crazy doubt would agree super spreader event ruin hard-fought peace. already law place. certain amount years, release information make them, get cheaper genetic version drug. Ask people invested billions make money crazy. also accord fail research return. Nobody invest money government don’t allow make money. government fund research. look us. News article news article; study study concluded protests significant component increase. cases, may overall dampening effect (more people stayed home avoid protests involved them).

What wrong reading/analytical skills? even receive education? did, shortcoming think causes difficulty? False, scientists finding AC units spreading virus. know virus stays micro droplets 3 hours.  Talking creates micro droplets.  Absolutely unsafe indoors anyone infected.  cotton mask doesnt protect you.  Cotton mask protect people around you. also released lot information two week asymptomatic period late February early March. Iiterally hear U.S. news mid April May. presented though shocking new revelation. think disagree. read headline go straight gym. Some, lots refused open. packed. People went tubing past weekend too; crowd supposedly huge. Damn. Contact? I’d assume would void can’t ensure safe environment work in. know new cases leads hospitalizations leads deaths. New cases rising bit now, hospitalizations starting follow. really hard believe daily death count follow soon? Correct. would love know age medical background passed cruise ship. lung damage prior infection? 

Also someone explain math me??

""Interestingly, [asymptomatic] people look feel fine, researchers CT scan image lungs, 50 100 percent cases, actually found abnormalities,"" Oran explained. agree, hospitals do. mean blame her. hospitals think can, do, get away charging exorbitant prices best hide it, know there's middle man (insurance) subsidizing costs.

If costs advertised front, consumers direct consumer literally every insured industry, predict health costs would plummet folks start shop around.

I use Kaiser, $20 copay literally everything. expensive scans surgeries $30, meds $10 copay generics/$15 brand name. That's it. Nothing else. bills.

I would never go back PPO/standard insurance plan. since pay $189 annual physical(tot total bill nearly $300), found could get bloodwork done Wellness FX $89, there's plenty tele-medicine clinics deal cash payments. *federal* government acted late provinces fine own. 

I know BC health minister Adrian Dix harassing counterparts Ottawa force airlines allow physical distancing domestic flights again. clear press briefing today Transport Canada order that. 

BC one step ahead federal government whole time. Even Trudeau opens border early, BC still order travellers entering province outside Canada self-isolate 14 days. Yep. I’ve heard pediatricians - don’t business nobody cold. Illinois resident here. “Phases” nothing misinterpreted levels safety. pace, we’ve done nothing except offset eventual surge. Arizona repeat. Wait month so. $2400 treatment vaccine, talking Gilead thing. Kansas normally start school year  time CyberPunk 2077. take account people might available testing weekends. test show up. ""In beginning Universe created. made lot people angry widely regarded bad move."" Yeah, that's pretty much I'm expecting to. blame though. videos I've seen people bars/clubs Scottsdale horrifying.  think everyone else thought OP meant $100 per entree. page read clarification. also missed takeaway mean, could post link anyways. worried it, though. personally firing fireworks, neighbor gets arrested power him. live always fireworks laws prohibit big fireworks explode air, yet every year lived locals put better shows actual cities beaches (we get treated light show way home beach every year). one anything it, among ones cause ruckus case police randomly decide something year. mistake Gen Z apparently repeat, Teen Vogue's hard-hitting political articles indication. oldest Gen Z (5 years, 1997-2002) able vote November's election, half able vote 2024, boomer generation starts dying higher rate.  case, I’m glad I’m NYC Cuomo looking air-conditioning units work opening gyms movie theaters.

any Hospital HVAC professionals here?

Can talk HVAC systems deal deadly microscopic air particles COVID-19 ? Luckily we're indoor facility let anyone mask in, everyone (except one lady argued management called illegal let kids pay stuff without masks ""medical exemption""?)

Garcetti shut city curfew soon windows got broken Beverly Hills cop cars burned name public safety, impending doom see hurdling towards us even demanded another lockdown him. Uuhhh.... week ago? spell two months native tongue? mean, country would brain dead retarded can't quarantine container ship. modern container ship manned less dozen crews. Consider fact face coverings reduce transmission droplets. Even talking transmitting droplet, sneezing coughing transmit higher volumes droplets.

A mask magically filter everything, anything droplet trapped covering, reducing transmission extent. said, nobody reason wear mask except ego. surgeons wear masks 2-12 hours operations, people wear one waiting line non-fat skim mocha caramel bullshit. apparently Yeah, summary “fake make trump look bad.” I’m assuming that’s means, case increases faked order blame trump rallies. lot people telling me, lots people, say yuge. They've never seen huge one. come say biggest tumor. Many people saying this. Party Traitors. Knucklehead. classic New Jersey insult. Also doctors NYC learn shit went. shared learned across country think we’re better He's done opposite he's forced churches open municipal codes. used laugh doomsday preppers Netflix.

If prepper reading this, I'm sorry. Wanna hang out? little, late No. No, no, no, no, no. Many scientists actually fought wrong still are. There's way ego science post portrays keeps newer, potentially life saving info getting populace. scientists, many women, saying virus could spread asymptomatic carriers airborne February March, ignored shot again... even today, many scientists deny mounting evidence bodies pile up.

Science may ideals America. run humans. Ahaha thanks bro. actually lowkey try keep good karma comments guy ducey must one “ Doomers” crappy masks protect wearer little, fact they're lot better nothing, still far 100% protection. Maybe around 60%ish. 18-30 year olds going hangout party. Sorry it’s true. Open colleges, keep bars open. Keep grandma home look data, particular Johns Hopkins University, yes rise cases, mortality figures rising, well seems reports ICUs overwhelmed more. would fair say countries, US AU, undertaking much higher levels testing, results positive cases, seeing correlation mortality rates increase positive cases, result increased testing ?  


Here AU seeing cases rise one state, inline dramatic increases availability testing testing rates, hospitals effected, mortality rate changed all. can’t Agreed. Hey live kansas heard mask requirement. effectively mean caught wearing mask states enforce wearing mask, all? It’s anecdotal. Look numbers read stories yourself. want pretend it’s fat old people already dying that’s simply true.

No one disputing BC fit healthy whatever else gets off...I really don’t care. reality virus doesn’t give two shits you’re tip-top shape not. wear put out. means strain already strained economy. means bring light underlying conditions someone didn’t know COVID exacerbated issue. 

Again, also point fact skipped right past: country led fucking fruit doesn’t bode well kind leadership need ensure people need order safe. Wearing mask still debate among people...and really think crowding everyone gym positive thing? bike, run, hike, lift, yoga, etc outdoors comfort home. Many gyms even offering virtual classes. go outside stay home socialize working out. literally reason—beyond stubborn prick—to think need gyms right now. virus spreads much easily indoors outdoors spreads much easily people wearing mask exercising know case.

And can’t spell COVID19 either.

Remember it’s USA said it’s nothing flu January February, leads nations Brazil India follow America’s footsteps Yes. Whenever symptoms cold flu wear mask. issue thing REALLY high % people symptoms vs. Flu. took 120,000 Americans dead occurred might problem. could “do treat elderly patient may already sick long live anyway” “do treat young otherwise healthy person.” believe something happening Italy. Nobody said they’re useless

Plenty people seem think unfortunately. No, management ruined stepping in.  manager needs step accept blame Subtle differences verbage, probably going towards lockdown one bar time got back run. Running calisthetics need. I'm considering cancelling membership altogether, they've charged last 3 months followed instructions cancel/put account hold. make fuss reimbursing me, I'm out.

It’s based Ebola vaccine never went mass production. even read article ? landlords get REAL jobs. Owning property charging others live occupation breaks heart eventually take people take seriously. I'm New Jersey everyone know least loosely knows someone either hospitalized died, certainly makes easier take precautions seen firsthand fuck to.

That sentence alone 1st world countries view us Americans.  I've spoken many Europeans thinking different universe learning type system america lol. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 means already know enough respiratory viruses general (colds, flus, etc) make reasonable assumptions safe around one yet fully understand. jeeze. wtf, america? Cops might ticket spot wearing mask, theory, practice it’s really enforced. Making required instead strongly advised convincing people comply rather actually enforcing it. call 'Stupidity Fatigue'. It’s compliance enforcement here. many places one lacking. NY got hit early listened projections said hospitals would overwhelmed made Covid patients stay (or put in) nursing homes hospitals would OK. hospitals never overrun (much usual) something like 6,000 died nursing homes.

Additionally, invasive procedures early often cost lot lives due medical error.

No state get even close bad NY bad projections medical mismanagement. You’d surprised honestly. idiots here. many USA course, takes one. I’m - couldn’t describe better. Though may add think people suburbs taking less seriously. think it’s weren’t hit hard thus don’t see urgency virus. comparison, live area hit really hard felt nervous even leaving apartment April. thought “second wave” meant $250k year, 125k taxes

you instantly wrong right here. one pays 50% effective tax rate.

even effective tax rate high 40%, pay 100k loans live 50k cash annually (which significantly americans live on) make 150k taxes ~20 years retirement, retire multimillionaire 60. Many disregarded information reputable sources too. Coronavirus fatality rate 60 times fatal flu.

If think similar need better math skills  federal system U.S. somewhat unique, much power delegated states governors, federal primacy limited certain powers enumerated. liberal democracies stronger central government, even unitary system region devolved powers. way pretend 50 semi-independent countries, borders often totally arbitrary, proven uniquely bad fit pandemic. We’re unable set binding national policy guidelines, there’s restriction movement across state lines. weaknesses system could ameliorated somewhat coordinated federal response, even participation state voluntary, ship long since sailed that. seems quoted way... opinion. Personally see value them. find beneficial go it. wont due bad experiences stocks. worth it. able retire earlier walking away stocks investment. still old account I've put dime onto since shortly 9/11. really improved much look year so. Still even recovered put never mind growing. don’t think you’re seeing long-term picture. Right now, businesses won’t risk it. believe lockdown temporary.

But happens cash reserves deplete? happens government can’t provide type financial support next lockdown? happens almost every small business owner getting desperate realizes don’t open illegally, never open again? everyone it, it’s hard enforce punishments. law enforcement even fine arrest people, especially community they’re sympathetic business owners? Yeah starting IRA usually thing investing stocks, albeit usually mutual fund sort. means he'd rather buy index fund buy individual stocks, perfectly reasonable position. handle decided want handle it

This surprising one TBH. would never thought possibility. Toronto. Downtown. neighbour suburbs get otherwise none local stores. Used fought USSR cool probablity always 1, we're fucked matter what. even survive pandemic, escape economic fallout we're tied together world economy. make that, wars start due economic hardships people's desperation leading election dictators conmen? Looks like found way stop school shootings. Sorry grandma. lot antibody tests inaccurate. Totally free state. idea Texas weird though. wanna miss thing book could said Windows viruses Yea fundamentally system fucked. Covid highlighting problems having. 70 workers zero savings. Theres reason federal unemployment got passed cause band aid since without it. USA would economic hell fire. 

As worker. literally benefits government. Either company good pay benefits literally 100% fucked like u said. unsustainable vast majority Hate tell you...they weren’t acting. happening anytime soon........... worked supporting hospital billing software 2 years. ~40% hospitals US used software. People idea complex be.

Here's rundown hospital visit goes billed. Please note software super buggy ton bugs could triggered every step process. Every time mention human something, that's opportunity someone make mistake. Also, I'm going memory anyone works billing still, feel free correct me.

1. medical work done. Charges placed encounter doctors nurses. done moment care. saw hospitals give doctors year place charges encounter based sticky notes desk.

2. Charges processed system grouped based charge tier(the thing cost different amounts) type charge, institutional(hospital) professional(doctor). heard grapevine doctors evaluated amount professional charges doling out, idk true.

 2a. Charges could suspend due processing due hundred different things. Someone called chargemaster would typically try fix issue.

3. first charge dropped, encounter created billing software. Encounters split two pieces, clinical financial. caused lot issues clinical financial sides would match other.

4. encounter sits financial software billing hold, cannot billed holds removed encounter. include discharge, coding, hold software determines special medicare billing rules applied, encounter modifications triggered every time someone modifies patient registration. happens everything encounter reprocessed. 

 4a. hundred bugs code evaluated encounter modifications. One infamous called **RED WEDDING**, removed charges financial software. basically disappeared. proper way fix log ticket people billing office would drop charges encounter based remembered partial information.

5. Rules evaluated determine discounts applied based contracts insurance companies well kinds discounts triggered. so, billing hold may triggered encounter manually reviewed someone billing office.

6. holds cleared, encounter processed claim generation software determines send claims(lots people multiple insurance plans).

7. Payments received insurance providers. may include partial payments rejected claims. get evaluated software human resolve.

8. encounter goes rules apply possible self-pay discount, automatically triggered requested patient. often required approval.

9. Encounters go statement generation get mailed out.

10. Payments received processed or, payments, encounters get routed series rules determine go collections.

Every rule processing custom hospitals rules, dozens hundreds rules single process. one hospital might automatically apply self-pay discounts put payment plan non-payment, another could merciless send straight collections 30 days non-payment. incorrect? Went PF once, one mask, hardly distancing, people lazy cleaning equipment. walmart gyms. im gonna wait till covid Add appetizer ($18) couple entrees ($25-35 each) dessert ($12) easily hit $150 plus $15 tax $30 tip. That’s remotely new.... Yeah. One way clear beaches violin vigil, that’ll definitely get beaches tear gassed cleared hurry! retraction asymptomatic people:

 

And masks work:

 COVID-19 spread people symptoms know infected. That’s it’s important everyone wear cloth face coverings public settings practice [social (staying least 6 feet away people). 

 

Once again: 
My mask protects YOU, ME. Even get sick die COVID, others, even appear young people without underlying health conditions, get sick &amp; die COVID wear mask. No, take punch, losers. Trump hotels Read discussion actual doctors treating patients, instead Facebook Man think that's failure leadership let tell dude elected president. nothing, going lose customers well. bars open sustainable. open prolongs inevitable. focus right thing saving many lives can. That's best option shit sandwich right now. agree this. believe you’re giving comment much credit think it’s ethics voting. It’s simply advocating like homeless stop consuming even electricity. 

But, yes, unfortunately, idiots allowed vote. I’ve spent many summers Europe wouldn’t say it’s different States. would actually say things way crowded Europe US still are. won’t flying. Screw ‘em. truly heartbreaking admire bravery resilience. Unlike though, won’t insult offend nothing happiness contribute journey. makes happy, feel free so.

I tuberculosis 13 sick months, know chronic infections life threatening conditions. compassionate, dumb ass.

It’s sad people feel hatred solves issues appropriate response differing opinions. still fighting racism homophobia among humanitarian issues.

May blessed long healthy prosperous life. hope someday realize hatred answer differing opinion. probably won’t continue call names. Hope fulfills 💕 would terrifying experience. would petrified. horrible horrible thing. comment literally basis facts reality.  Developing new medicine takes years. matter many bodies dollars throw this, hard limits quickly progress. virus, hand spreads extremely quickly. weeks away real catastrophe.

Science definitely prevail long term. Short term, screwed matter do. Things go back normal point. Surely year going end big fuck meteor hitting planet. Sorry can't prepare global pandemic three months notice? Jesus moron almost captivating. mean ""everything"" ? thought goal pretty clear, non essentials remain closed. Restaurants gyms essential money's Houston within next 10 days. Im town Portland care grandma. Wearing mask town times, going minimally around town (groceries), wearing times around grandma home. Considering average age Bend/Sisters, SHOCKED many 50-60+ yo’s see wearing mask social distancing all. Looks like San Diego county idiots idiots LA. Fucking great. 

They need tbis STATE WIDE. epidemics run course eventually. accurate data data long ago, chances virus infectious one seeing come gone throughout course history. One one hand, knowledgeable stop spread save human life today, hand earth populated making easier spread. Heartbreaking ...sorry, guys. I've suddenly seeing people reference interview lot last days. wonder mentioned Hannity shit.

Anyway, disingenuous suggest millions people listening experts burned they'll never listen again. people refuse wear masks eat lie lie Trump. accomplished lot. Keep going strong, friend! shit.

It's two year thing lockdowns silly. What's gonna happen gonna happen Brain recognize brain. We’ve watched story rolling basis since January. great yet?  That's enough give PTSD reading it. fucking care money economy.

**I FUCKING CARE 200K+ DEAD, INCLUDING COUSIN!!** No, mean lung scans showing severe damage, strokes younger people who've ""recovered"", onset type 1 diabetes recovered patients, abnormal heart beats recovered patients, longterm cases frequent relapses lasting 90 days.

Evidence says yes. know scope far recoveries pandemic. H1N1 sub type - same. Spanish flu also type H1N1 influenza virus. 

This interesting article compares two. running lot Q, I’ve always worried could pick running past people.

Thats masks for...

Also give people vulnerable running. Probably not. could vaccines end year. happens, distributed well, could behind us next April. like free risk health, yours, MINE, want to.

There go thinking you. isn't. would rather spreading disease benefit caring people harming plague rat behavior. That’s look 7-day rolling average day. accounts human reported delays like holiday tech issues something. really apply data math here. According CDC, using minute confirmed cases count confirmed death count, death rate 4.9% US right now. Compare 0.1%, death rate seasonal flu US. right there, serious flu.

The consensus estimate I've seen takes accomplish herd immunity infection rate 70% entire US population. US population right estimated right 331 million, 70% 231.7 million people get infected achieve herd immunity. Apply 4.9% death rate that, 11.4 million dead people. express deadliness raw numbers, changes one's view overall situation. least, changed mine.

I also really push back idea overwhelming vast majority people going get mildly infected. aggregate, data in, might prove true, everyone playing Russian roulette health. amount know virus compared know virus like comparing contents bookshelves home contents library Congress. BLM protests eclipsed news, really interesting medical coverage virus talking people, virus progresses pure respiratory infection infection affects endothelial lining red blood cells. explains lot strange blood clotting disorders seen confirmed patients ages without comorbidities, well cardiac renal complications seen people ages without comorbidities.

The end result is, there's something physiologically perhaps genetically people getting vicious effects virus scientists know physiological genetic characteristics make likely either die long-lasting serious damage body. know you, that's something I'm willing risk. accurate old people people serious underlying conditions either succumbing disease death coming disease long-term damage elsewhere body.

That's message getting there. message based numbers, basic math, message based completely randomized risk. know know virus, completely random whether healthy 30-year-old going dialysis rest life example. that's die. Yikes. Sorry, comes weird religious, it?

I meant can't anymore. People thinking I'm joking dramatic. I'm not. plan hang myself. I'm waiting money come afford supplies. can't anymore. want end. give fuck happens die. care permanent sleep go hell whatever. scared. want end. wait, working?? missed part today, 2.67 million reported cases, 129k reported deaths. know numbers underreported, want argue one more. Let's work numbers we've got. That's 4.8% fatality rate US.
 
Now, there's zero proof stay immune long recovering it, many cases people saying they've once, sounds like successive case worse. since data yet, factor might get worse time.
 
So we're looking nearly 5% confirmed cases dying, presumably people get 2-3 times year. five year span, majority non-believers get twice year average, that's 50% science deniers dead half decade.
 
If cumulative permanent damage, widely suspected, numbers worsen think good chance majority (maybe 75%) maskless wiped out.
 
Unfortunately, impact lot people way out, like thing living lives already. take hot.. sushi...sandwiches, salads starters summer huge outdoor dining culture Europe. It’s 3 months No, context. Aa young person, happier hear that. care get it, care get see parents without worrying risking lives. True I'm pedantic.

OP purposefully placed emphasis world ""all"". 

You dont use word ""all"" mean ""40%"". know, right? Finally nation's leaders stepped plate.

Which sadly terrifying accurate is. That's fair point small part idiotic public, yes. much others' safety own? Unless talking n95 respirators. point, people simply selfish? care number asymptomatic cases.

All matters deadly is.

You sit talk everyone see *Two weeks....*

I'm looking factual numbers known. Oh telling hope die isn’t dickhead thing huh? That’s ironic lmao.

Ok child hahaha.

Just keep walking around idea karmas coming hahaha. yeah, surprised too. new mayor mandated masks. good ole boy system took overturned it. Sheesh. agree...so anti-science ridiculous. Everywhere. unnecessary. one cares protecting health care workers anymore?

I frequent another forum (people average income) would debate want wear mask want lock down. argument masks work survival rate high healthy. point hospitals get overwhelmed, would ignore argument (i.e. reasonable comeback), keep repeating thing -- masks lock down. kinda odd. acting like piece shit say true? That's stating is. unfortunate that's reality you, true. *them thar taters ain't gonn pick 'emselves son*. KN95. Chinese made N95. Try get company ship quickly already stock US. Obviously money factor decision. Profits first, passenger safety second. Still waiting *scientific studies* well, kiddo. burden you. We're keeping nursing homes. point, Chinese government credibility US pandemic matters. US government can't trusted *anything* right anymore. Well yeah. meant numbers really spun positive way much important protests might something it.

#BLM health. Wear mask. Stay others faces. reports another possible flu pandemic fill joy, question occur many illnesses come China? like factory least environment ideal propagation. exactly No, pandemic far article mentions wearing masks become somewhat political issue. Understatement year. MSM networks based New York/New Jersey. Hence, like rest America, problem isn’t nearly serious isn’t affecting personally!

Sadly, pandemic dramatically illustrated bunch myopic, self-centered people nation.

It profoundly disturbing nation, citizens could inconvenienced six freakin weeks staying home good greater population without bitching whining “restrictive” “unconstitutional“ was!

For crying loud...you asked stay home and/or avoid social settings public while. People act like unfairly hauled Guantanamo Bay something.

i understand need work many jobs able done home. one NEEDS go bar beach! legitimate needs go need taking necessary precautions. mask inconvenient spite BS stories contrary, help prevent transmission illness!

Is staying home inconvenient? Hell yes - US! Seriously, morons think people life would rather home?

But fighting war wars inconvenient! hoax, conspiracy “just like flu” Yes, necessarily going fatal many...but awful lot survive may wish killed them!

While data survivors going back seven months so, results encouraging survivors...particularly ventilators. Organ damage, particularly lung heart, well significant emotional disturbance commonly reported.

Many survivors going lives filled chronic illness on. Yes, survived virus, FAR “FINE”!

Spread information everyone know. don’t believe you, encourage search ‘covid 19 survivor health consequences’ find information.

The media great job emphasizing long term health problems associated illness. Post-viral secondary conditions bad even worse underlying virus caused them.

Personally, became infected virus twenty one years ago. date, virus never identified extensive testing. Fortunately, easily transmissible others,I spent weeks hospital undergoing anti-viral IV treatment. finally survived infection released hospital, however without consequence, right eye completely blinded lost 50% visual field left eye. also suffer post-viral cardiomyopathy...a chronic heart condition required regular medical attention ever since. Sporadic neuromuscular abnormality chronic myofascial spasms pain among many long term effects life!

Do think even second nearly 6 million people survived problems over. great number them, begun!

Oer You’re alone. 

- Oxford vaccine others purportedly looking pretty good

- People are, average, eating healthier exercising more

- Season 5 Eric Andre Show slated come later year

- General public knowledge viruses disease transmission significantly higher

- Supply chains holding together far

- lot time practice self care

Also keep mind, drive grocery store see goofballs giving fuck, aren’t seeing people staying home responsible. aren’t seeing people trying make difference, naturally brain biased towards “nobody cares.” Remember people don’t see, there’s lot them. declared health emergency, vaccines made optional. thought comparing total tests before. makes sense! scenario could open things cases exponential growth healthcare system handle. That's fast car control scenario. 

Of course, ""No brakes! brakes!"" heading downhill winding mountain road person really wants believe president he'll pretend hard keep eyes closed ears covered. my, rich compelling opinion, sweetie. learn mistakes keep control time

Oh sweet summer child... wear masks suggest people wear them. Neither compare wearing 1 2 layer cotton mask wearing one. everyone see wearing 2 layer cotton mask. Usually pretty loose fitting. wonder types masks measurable benefit. minority population goes gym 🤷‍♂️ hear ya... 55 miles vs right epicenter whole different game exactly right. spoonfeed us earlier extending lockdowns two weeks time public go nuts. everyone man. I’m watching New Zealand it’s truely sensational watch. Fucking morbid. Wishing best. Sad true seems. think matter, piece shit acting like piece shit internet, absolute bottom low humanity scale. Yea, point 
Derp first thought corona like 2003 avian flu too, boy oh boy wrong **ONE PERSON BULGARIA TESTS POSITIVE COVID-19**

**SHOCK**

**HORROR** meant back April like 1000-2000 deaths per day 300-500? changed? Well, hospitals nearly full 1,500 deaths attributed COVID, so.... Man... tired people. one said it’s me, stay inside rest life you’d like to, wether things open back up. Stay inside you’ll safe. truly sad people like resort hatred insults someone differing opinion. still fighting racism homophobia, “plague rats” like don’t think feel exactly like you. 

Do makes happy, insult me, call names, call everyone else names, violent, cruel, stay inside forever continue keyboard warrior, free please! like free risk health, yours, MINE, want to. bet explosive diarrhea pandemic leaves itchy places cannot reach. Jar Jar Trump true statement. However, neither protect ChinaVirus Someone provide summary thid stupid fucking article

The comments post seem like absolute trash totally unhelpful Good you! Save America! Wear mask, wash hands, socially distance! 

-The US govt PSA campaign plastered media platforms. 

Unification.

Instead get White House saying it’s control President refusing wear mask, campaigning it’s scam liberal Left, medical chief saying cases could hit 100,000/ day soon. maddening many people country something prevent spread disease large part action (or lack action) one man. Many try justify freedom issue oxygen issue, call mask wearers sheep, Trump come beginning promoted mask use, I'm sure would wearing mask along. blind allegiance and/or mass delusion face evidence scary. Uh, yes is.

They’ll never experience understanding regret.

I need quit Facebook. Thank goodness banks stepping up!!

We're doomed.  Oof Oh Florida...Go sit corner face wall. type r/coronavirus post I’ve come expect. that. damn sure vitamin plays role this. much covid. Allowing restaurants bars open people inside without masks good policy pandemic. Whether felt attempt keep businesses alive without federal assistance another question, it’s still horrible policy proven failure. Heared Siberian/Arctic wild fires?  don’t think would go back total lockdown all-if anything they’ll probably close bars indoor dining go back mostly phase 3 stuff phase 4. numbers continued steadily decline phase 3 don’t see reason we’d revert further. 

Bars least proving terrible idea nationwide. Open beer gardens! far know Spanish Flu lasted two years multiple waves. give time, lot still happen. That’s gonna dawg Customer always right phrase Karen invented Karen, never business model business. expected, proven ignorant Copenhagen Consensus Center think tank uses sophisticated algorithms best available data compare alternate poverty-fighting strategies. tools allowed us test interesting hypothesis: Suppose foundation hadn’t invested Gavi, Global Fund GPEI instead put $10 billion S&amp;P 500, promising give balance developing countries 18 years later. last week, countries would received $12 billion, adjusted inflation, $17 billion factor reinvested dividends.  invested $10 billion energy projects developing world? case, return would $150 billion. infrastructure? $170 billion. investing global health institutions, however, exceeded returns: $10 billion gave help provide vaccines, drugs, bed nets supplies developing countries created estimated *$200 billion* social economic benefits.

Let break you. ""billionaire returns"" reading approximate benefit **COUNTRIES** receive bill's help. **NOT** money ""Billy g."" *200 billion* estimate brought Copenhagen Consensus Center, tool calculating comparing best methods solve world problems. mean bill gates countries straight took $200 billion selling vaccines, means country get $200 billion worth benefits extra workforce surviving children, reduction costs medical care preventable diseases, etc ***FUTURE***. THAT'S means $200 billion ***Social economic benefits.***

You're clear example zhonerism, someone scared things understand. Gullible beyond salvation ignorant beyond comprehension. Everyone ok right now.  Hopefully cases near one pending test result friend's kid exposed someone tested positive. U.S. already far 100,000 new cases per day.

Antibody testing shown actual mortality rate covid-19 perhaps .5%. thousands deaths per day. means hundreds thousands cases per day.

All reach 100,000 new confirmed cases per day testing. Fauci tends diplomatic warnings. Basically softly speaks sometimes (like case) suggests obvious truth. knows what’s heading, could seeing matter weeks merge imagine bad flu season miss diagnosis. Probably 70K range. Tbh though that's blip this. We've already 125K deaths people still want brush everyone affected yet care sadly. I'm aware. Davos funny. Neither president let’s go inject bleach lungs.  3 months late, thanks Toronto!

I know *""better late never""* scenario, douchebags public health advocated **against** masks early, turned tail, confusing literally everyone process, there's antimasker section population always say *""WELL SAID DONT HELP AIN'T WEARIN IT""* every time someone actually wants somethingl ike this. What? quick search shows US 4.7 million population world war 1. get 100,000 from? ""there patients begging put ventilator know might die, might see families again"" jesus christ terrifying. one wants themselves. one, all. Sounds like covid. 30% asymptomatic. assumed meat plant infections due high density workers.

But looking up, couple noteworthy porcine coronaviruses.

I curious see anyone looking sars cov 2 infecting pigs Wish best. think dumb ones get bottom tho. scare something thinking now. quarter way through, like, “Okay, think need stop, let’s skip end.” expecting end AI invading universe 40 years lol Get instant pot cook stew yourself. takeout food 100% safe since handling process involves humans containers guaranteed clean.

Given lax standards states, I'd trust take out. people lazy. true even pandemic. knew masks work. Meanwhile full fake news campaign reddit. wonder stop spreading misinformation around masks. much propaganda unbelievable. work, clearly knew feb/march. It’s 8x higher Sweden relative neighbors, **800%**. less 19% residents Sweden foreign born 220% higher likelihood one would expect less 42% higher compared country zero residents foreign born. Norway 1/10 deaths per capita 15% foreign born residents

Edit: adjusted values using never hold back seasoning, simply cannot afford butter 1200 cal day. course did. No, that's keep political think died from? I’d love read hobby occupy time don’t breaks since take care son 7am-7pm everyday. missing three 0s So, study “Of Mice Men” ? We’re true. However, given outcome COVID-19 likelihood swine flu allowed spread low. However, given got point it’s anyone’s guess really. former way important. take little joys life make life actually worth living, might well dead anyways.

This sub fails see little joys anything. Little known fact.

California state employee prison unions driving force behind drug three strike laws Lmao someone California don’t even know start explaining far are. Homogenous means same. Source: CDC Right. Next time I'm getting margarita. 1. I'm rich. Stay inside (as much practically can).
2. Partake socially distant, responsibly protected fun like.
3. worried fun, perhaps actually understand what's going on.

Stop rolling dice people's lives responsible, adult thing, already. daily back forth. E.g. vaccine coming, vaccine never coming, need 2nd lockdown, absolutely need lock again.  he's supposedly scientist expert ""not politician"" ride narrative say he's public service humble enough admit wrong go conscience redirect. fair others, could well media sources choosing emphasize fit whatever want say. technically misquoting him, might well spin foregoing context. going impossible get N95 year. Yes applies almost universally everyone. think exceptions offhand say ""almost universally"" case edge case I'm thinking of.

Everyone hold reasonable opinion, ""You look ways cross road"" ""I approach baby bear cub"" ""Appointing someone Supreme Court way impact future policy far beyond presidency."" Including Trump. Study actually use ethnicity origin.

In Sweden there's 3000 Mexican origin, 4000 Canadian origin, 21000 American origin. part problem... Cops think black people bad black, black people thinks cops bad cops. Genetics seem like cruel joke sometimes. value lives much, whatever nature decides give us stuck forever, study implies crossing fingers relying genes matters almost much social distancing wearing mask.

I still hope though maybe another study contradicts one. seems logical lower viral load results less symptoms since immune system time make antibodies. Maybe immune system bother trying make virus reaches certain threshold? Working home means actually working, home. mean time supervise homeschool kids addition full-time job. every one dint went side virus would run course. likely going anyways drag months years then? May 4 thought would [200,000 cases 3,000 deaths per June 1. Basically one knows shit what’s actually going happen scary projections get people act right; it. going say, Edison *giant* asshole, comparison Musk actually pretty accurate. want co-authors smoking. happens trust peoples gut feelings facebook research real scientists doctors - please take note people Northeast cases begin rise need avoid.

edit: line cracked ""Mr Ducey also asked residents get urgent tasks done order began Monday evening stressed: “Remember safer home. need go out, go out.”""

What fuck urgent business bar, gym, waterpark, movie theater? anyone gets panties bunch, authors study saying BLM riots caused even people stay home. overall effect ends social distancing lower infection rates area. Lots people may wanted go bar restaurant (and may subsequently infected) stayed home instead. Maybe no-mask MAGA types got scared? interesting question try study get actual numbers. name Ducey, leads many call ""Douchey"" given policies personality. Massachusetts recently requires every state except like 7 8 others northeast quarantine 14 days upon entry. Fauci quack god bless america yet we’re working it. fairness, previous administration war game pandemics put response team place, current administration US completely incompetent. Agreed. I’m tired people like people wrote article saying average vaccine development time decade. average vaccine development would 2 candidates already phase 3 trials 6 months. Plus plenty non-US western countries already controlled virus borders pandemic already pretty aside travel restrictions.

However, trying get vaccine distributed poorest worn torn parts world going enormous challenge likely take longer 2 years. mean think many vaccine-preventable diseases still present world. virus eradicated via vaccination smallpox. Jesus Christ look like nanotechnology Why? party responsible US story just... 

There words. hope hang little baby.... somehow current administration spin win. ""At least 250k per day"". Hey man, people care you. Sounds like wife son. Try reading books, video games, exercising every morning. Make list 3 things want day accomplish them. don’t big, feels good finish daily goals. example - workout, read 2 chapters, clean closet you’ve meaning get to. something like work on. Also you’re Game Thrones, book series really good imo. Australian. Aussie short Australian, never Australia. honestly 7-day rolling average positivity crosses 15% need re-instate lockdowns community spread way much dealt closing restaurants gyms. mean. Without vaccine that’s unfortunately realistic way ending Good ya man. I've working seasonally awhile resort. I've developed aversion people drinking, sure, own. I've distancing since start, here, waiting things clear get isolated place, yeah.. gonna long quarantine.

Can imagine sick booze gotta gig, eesh. That'd hit real quick. Gavi Microsoft going team create microchip vaccine dye thing? Completely ignoring Microsoft software company Gavi develop vaccines distributes them? Seems like weird duo create microchip dye vaccine. would think like Intel Gilead would effective duo that, fit dumb ass conspiracy theory.  Got it, actually interested challenges facing Chicago people trying address challenges. want use political bludgeon. guess makes ""sheeple"" boogeyman. wonder leaders haven’t preparing us this? know, dumb question. I’ve always felt going marathon, sprint, especially since Spanish flu look back on. Good news made 6 months far. take day day... bet..it sure difficult witness people work health care. Could? zero chance think it, 100,000 per day Canada's worth Covid cases (since start pandemic) per day. Sure problems testing early on, exactly, still definitely gives perspective. Canada get 2-300 new cases per day. also, keep mind media's true ""objective"" - clicks ad revenue. boil lengthy statement question, context, 5-minute sound clip/headline.

there numerous vaccines development around world. gone phase 2/3 testing. likely one work, however, within phase 2/3 many vaccines fail due side effects, etc. 

Fauci simply reminding us harsh reality, side vaccine coin - possible vaccine ready end year/early 2021 due roadblocks faced phase 2/3.

i much layman, regurgitating information read watched. people saying 'we adapt new normal' laughable. lived smallpox, spanish flu, black plague, aids, polio 2 world wars. virus change live. may try that. hard toddler. know multiple nurses Boston, said exact opposite (many covid-specific floors ghosttowns, even peak far nightmare). Italy thing fair though. actually hit capacity 🙄 Children households known infection get infected half often adults household. really naturally resistant Damn. Yeah, I'm assuming people going flocking Pismo Beach well. can't nice things. Wait, knuckleheads? New Jersey? way. Oh, yes - hopefully accessible treatments continue developed/discovered hurtle onwards unknown.

Our economy ZA can't handle lockdown, unlikely healthcare system handle opening up. point rely civic responsibility improving treatments (and perhaps vaccine - idea that's feasible).

I truly hope low death rate remains way us too. Stay safe. Well saw happened banned it... 10 hours cubicle 130 people phone. It’s okay though- company measured cubicles sit super close desk face direction times 6 feet away good! office 5 days 3 separate cluster outbreaks. 1000% work remotely know - butts seats! people see shit hit fan? 

It's everybody's talking about... jersey shore still thing? Workers play close attention willing politicians seem compelling ‘essential’ workers’ labor. 
Labor unions may hope compel safe working conditions semblance fair compensation commensurate risks confronting many front line ‘essential’ workers. Welcome april may r/nyc China specifically addressed closed room recirculation issue, recommending fresh air ventilation. every test cost money though, spend country's money need to?

We really together.  Piggy McPigface! That’s less percent population 1k cases day nothing, also 300k many active. number active cases probably less 100k chances vaccine testers coming contact low (also someone knows self isolating less chance give someone testing vaccine) I'm UK. booked test online next day, drove up, test explained phone man standing outside car

AZ horrible state-local dynamic. state still dominated rural (with red R) voters, urban areas purple blue. Infighting county city politics popular passtime state representatives. Primarily, state targeted Flagstaff Tucson past years, they're predominantly progressive heavily blue. (For example, Tucson's gun disposal program scrapped state state legislator next county upset guns actually destroyed instead resold.) understand people think wearing masks protects others. That's simply true. someone coughs COVID particulate air breathe directly, ingesting every bit it. face covered sort mask, least *some portion* particulate (especially larger virus-rich droplets) going trapped mask, rather going directly mouth. Studies shown much, seems pretty obvious even without evidence. Thanks. Yeah think I'll wait now. sorry. Hope double triple mask surgical masks trip. know near you, back shelves local Walmart 25 17 bucks. not, headline purposefully misleading sound much worse Pence Azar claimed TV past weekend Uncle Sam back 100% testing hospital stay bill. mail Pence. I'm Canada, think pay healthcare something? pay probably 15-25% salary taxes strictly healthcare. people missed simply ignored message mask protects YOU, mask protects ME? don’t think rights extend risking health health love. unreasonable expect regard return?

Then states seeded thousands cases Summet, coming winter would see huge 2nd wave infecting millions. 2020. They're worried people's lives, they're worried seats congress. Masks also protect you. line literally propaganda shortage. Medical workers wear masks protect themselves.

After America gone shit, said everyone wear masks. 

Then testified lied people needing masks wanted preserve stock medical staff. 

If explained things early, maybe many idiots America wearing masks.

Yeah get virus seems mutated contagious, less lethal potential Trump turn vaccine shitshow releasing something dangerous untested Sep-Oct real.

I hate say expect vaccine effort marginal consequences predict better part million US deaths time next year. tens thousands protesters smooshed together, properly worn masks not, hours time day day certainly hand uptick too. Doesn’t seem like media even wants mention that. That’s essentially case every virus Going place people wearing masks still working dumb, I'm sorry. Yeah ok get points thinking ahead jfc please remember that, important individual responsibility is, first foremost failure leadership. Rushed reopenings, actively encouraging people go out, politicizing use masks, comes top first.

Please stop trying take agency. think 100,000 orders N95 masks made Amazon able keep demand? they’re testing more. Yup. Ocasio Cortez reminds Jacinda Ardern. I, one, welcome Coronavirus overlords. deaths low states like Florida lying cause death.

Just like Russia China, numbers fake fuck take fact value.

The number pneumonia deaths quintupled summer. This. read aboit reopening early would fuck economy even moreso staying shut down. Yet, reopened early financial executive branch pressures (Thanks Trump) look at. worst part jackasses crying reopening again. idea sucked, didnt work, youve forced us this... Damn bro, sucks hear that. aware Chile's situation death 5 times past two weeks unprecedented. California ""conservatives"" (non mask) live inland visit coasts cities (pro mask) especially summer.

There really way enforce people social pressure comply. can't stockpile lot PPE expires. rapidly consumed pandemic.

You need capacity manufacture it. can't rely buying countries competing hundreds countries country manufacturing needs. Europe significantly less virus floating around countries U.S. - place thing possible. That's point. Bearing mind people protesting couple months now, see problem this?

I think need enforcement businesses. wait weeks deaths start ramping up. Takes die Covid Keep fear, also keep hateful. Keeping hating downward rather looking bullshit actually raining from. Many eat gladly conveniently coincides pre-existing racism. Yes crown deterioration US, start. almost giving money actual doctors researchers help developing cure treatment faster. Shame Mr. Gatess billionaire something right? sick people can't cared it

Already happened NYC. friend resident peak; told awhile, enough beds/vents go around start turning people away  mention rampant systemic racism police corruption. always wondered many people seem think inovio great potential, inovio US government operation warp speed vaccine program? red flag? Politifact story it. Bob Anderson, chief Mortality Statistics Branch CDC, said someone dies corona pnemonia put death certificate. labeled statement ""false"" totally agree with.

If got 5,185 deaths pnemonia 1,762 deaths COVID. Even every single person died pnemonia also covid, thats still 3423 cases pnemonia average 900 cases. Still bad counting corona cases. 


 say lower older people - said rates vary country - pretending like Belgium representative fatality rates 40 everywhere true. Oman, really? listener here. clarify claims makes regarding vitamin supplements?

He claims taking care immune system something important hear medical professionals talking considered vitamin part that.

The reason views Vitamin part Vitamin continuously pops research again. people get shitty research always correlational treat proof quackery. However brought expert show acknowledged correlation stressed much strong correlational data was. 

Also pointed alot research giving people comically low doses Vitamin basing research vitamin levels people's blood instead idea supplemented. horribly flawed since blood concentration matters deficient actually takes quite alot bring normal time. using small moderate amounts basically waste everyone's research money kind crappy science TBH.

&amp;nbsp;

This best summarize accurately presents stance views best knowledge. listen me, [listen That's episode brings expert lady on. Oh time changed, still remember books like end history published cold war

to me, US\`s decline started moment USSR died. People seem forgot US middle class got first place - it\`s freedom american spirit whatever, it\`s simply great depression world war II, huge pressure inside outside, 0.01% choose compromise share profit average Joe, look tax rate 1950s 1960s ultra rich, see coming from

When USSR died, outside pressure suddenly gone, 0.01% done? lowered tax rate, started globalization begin source jobs, loosen restrictions M&amp;A form monopoly. short, longer need share profit 99% get support fight enemy

Look current US society, many people even talking root cause inequality. People distracted superficial social problems like race, LGBT etc. Everyone talking american response covid-19 disaster, many digging why. super rich affected covid-19 chaos caused protests? Heck profitting Fed\`s QE. 0.01%\`s interests totally dont align even contradicts 99.99%, course it\`s going disaster. 

The american people nowadays brain washed degree don\`t know enemy good themselves. benefit free market? big company freedom source jobs, working class freedom choose work for? America need stronger Federal government leaders like Franklin Roosevelt fight ultra rich, clown comment twitter play blame game foreign countries. imagine county county provider provider difference.

In northern part county, testing available people network.

County testing down-valley, started traveling testing sites cover county. get digital fireworks too? maybe vr/ar display festivities? Sweden looking pretty stupid while, approach looking better every day lately. Screw us wanting fewer people suffer die. right? bit running theme US, voting morons, perpetual war, desire unshackle foreign dependence energy continually interfering countries breaking nearly every law ethic say rest world follow. American people need ensure test someone president, even spelling test would made difference. Thanks sharing details #4.

China isolation quarantine (they typically separate couples family member prevent cross-infection). case, mother tested positive moved hospital, 3-year-old daughter completely alone quarantine, entirely appropriate young child, father asked care daughter quarantine. 

China made ""compassionate care"" exception father, I'm sure best train proper donning doffing PPE, tricky process done carefully. really hard prevent infection, rarity sort thing quarantine hotels / hospitals shows good processes procedures are. father probably made one minor error something contaminated, something incompletely sealed, got infected.

This highlights precisely China moved at-home family quarantine isolation quarantine, experience shows very, hard prevent family infecting other. also standard COVID-19 procedure deny visitors.

It's really sad entire family infected, good answer here. Sudden brain working lot Republicans... brain take hiatus last months? Still one brain work YET countries Central America currently rise. Mine included, unfortunately. swine flu again...my shirts lost many sleeves '09 outbreak. butthole survive another round It’s morons like make whole experience difficult everyone.

Congratulations! Mine testing kangaroos though.   don’t want numbers jump ~up~ down


Ftfy Rock prez 2020? understand Flu COVID-19 totally different, annual flu vaccination essentially best guess kind thing, even so, could reach herd immunity levels, ""good"" years/seasons, death rates would plummet, even ""bad"" years/seasons, vaccination seem provide level protection/symptom reduction.

With COVID-19 vaccine, herd immunity would hopefully able bring pandemic ""end"", course assumes somehow mutate form/version vaccine effective protecting against. 

My point totally see able reach herd immunity levels vaccinations COVID-19 least 'Merica simply seem unable something like Flu appears losing herd immunity levels ""childhood diseases"" years gone past.

I look forward safe effective vaccine developed, willing get vaccinated COVID-19, try protect families/households.

But herd immunity levels think going really hard reach/hit 'Merica enough people go get vaccinated.

I hope I'm wrong, people go get vaccinated able reach herd immunity levels US.

Cheers! die cant pay medical bills. Gotta living extended medical care. understand flu COVID-19 different.

My point cannot even get enough folks get annual flu vaccinations keep herd immunity levels ""childhood diseases"" like, regardless effective COVID-19 vaccine ""Merica, likely difficult possible reach herd immunity levels.

Hopefully, COVID-19 vaccines really effective provide strong/robust protection COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) protection lasts least year could ""added"" annual ""Flu"" shots, would annual ""Flu/SARS"" shots guess.

I hope US reach herd immunity levels, based happens annual ""Flu"" ""childhood disease"" vaccination rates, hard much hope, least ""Merica!

Cheers! takes around one year sweet anti- intellectualism phrase ""my ignorance good knowledge "". 

This covid exacerbating terrifying rate... Wow, well-thought I've ever seen explained. Saving next time try explain it. Yes, bars house parties *can* produce outcome.  Yea. it.
If threatening worked, wouldn’t fucked situation. Repulsive Exact opposite Czech republic, starting July 1 masks mandatory anymore. +1 big pharma, finding way profit situation  Yeah, rubes believe current theory would probably start like him. don’t think even pessimistic us would think boiled shitshow. still local R0 going down. Also Berlin btw, smaller local outbreak occurred. 
I think measures place able keep local outbreak local outbreak. Dude, virus **is still lower risk young people**.

I'm saying young people go out, risk covid suck hospital resources, commenter said virus less risk young people, patently untrue.

If wasn't, tf giving young people preference triage then? Ffs, absolute state sub. well family faired well doesn’t mean something take lightly may also meant viral loads fortunately low upon transmission bring read it, say discovered new flu reported people getting sick trying keep calm ? Well that's one way handle Wtf ??? test free ?? less well won’t want spend money test won’t bother , end spreading . wrong America ???? hell making weeks god help . Even adjusted population, statistic unsettling. Brace yourselves.  People complain perceived lack freedoms. Well, least nothing changed. someone hates change, one positive angle. also inevitable point. Even close everything today -which face won't- new cases going grow exponentially week least. Maybe protest (riot) bloody pandemic. police problem USA long time. protesting happened earlier. pandemic. 
These protest feel like sorry excuse vent frustration lockdown.
These protests blood hands police brutality last decade. decided invite person Birthday Party year Litres* Yea... going see 1 Johnny Q US. local health department. Literally every Fatality Rate young people remarkably lower everywhere else, pretending not.  think thar Dr. Fauci good terms mask guidance. actually snapped brother it. Early wanted get surgical-grade masks, going f***ing grocery store, shortages everywhere.

People almost always motivated selfishness. rest agree everything say, great post. worry, I'm sure things much better China's control. wonder social credit score go protest. disappear goes certain threshold? people bad asses whole lives!!! daughter phone call negative results. Took 2 days. Hey uh, California Washington, we're still part West Coast Pact agreed we're doing, right? Right? Cos I'm liking idea coming Oregon, I'm sick seeing people without masks. blaming doctors? They're ones eyeballs right dealing cases. doctor that's given national platform speak matter Fauci. media putting mics cameras front dipshit, clown politicians.

From healthcare standpoint, nothing changed - prevention, avoid public gatherings/social distance, use hand sanitizer liberally, wear mask. terms long-term effects, they're studying right now, seriously still know. channel looks made nonsense scare boomers culture war conspiracy stuff. yeah. almost like difference $1 $0.99.

But, man, times got stiffed penny though. need videos overloaded ERs nightly news. That’s right! little room another virus. Right guys?? Probably not, I'll absolutely give that. Air conditioning topic, reason can't live without that. go ahead get Refrigerator? We're talking n95s people health workers. need. got “critical fire weather conditions” alert. Get ready fire season N95s! Burning homes burning lungs heading way. 

Also Wtf Santa Barbara county? It’s 1am. don’t want hear unless it’s already burning. That's true lot otherwise far left people believe too. variance increased testing, certainly all. look rise percent tests returning positive dramatic rise cases. 

 Aaaand everyone idiotic, conceited mindset, everyone would get COVID-19 **😊** Covid-19 big deal 10% sample population antibodies it?

There 1 strains virus. Antibodies yet promise safe getting it.

I sure hope get plasma stem cells 10% save everyone, let's downplay pandemic one unsourced stat daily infections total infections, population around 14 million higher. one yet? Yet deaths plummeted. Makes medical sense this. Excuse me, ""world leaders""?.. virus naturally disappear 10% population, previously quarantined 90% start coming quarantine, number cases increase, even take scientist tell average person deduce that.
That's China open 14 days new cases pressured 0. never end new cases drop 0.
Even South Korea, best control eyes West, still 50 cases day. South Korean health officials warned sporadic mass infections plaguing country since strict social restrictions relaxed May 6, situation worsening, expansion stringent infection prevention measures nationwide may considered. measures currently implemented Seoul metropolitan area. Haha, blursday! I'm gonna start saying that. know frequent Portland subreddit, 95% compliance Fred Meyer let alone Lombard location incredible haha. I'm near Burlingame Freddie's last time like maybe 50% compliance, tho fair 25th Damnit well least, seemed like. don’t know parts state work everyone wearing masks they’re supposed people generally try stay away other. least 8k isn’t like... massive compared total population here. that’s probably beginning edited post, thanks info. Would nice made website (CovidCA.gov?) current information regarding mandates guidelines resources. current drip official information quite random (at least me). soooo may care! amazing, like vacation work school. insane. I'm 100% surprised people wearing mask since mask became mandatory cities. Shelter stopped one except go eat. Parks still filled brim people always walking around. insanity Shows United States can't handle task. Loom Smasher sale. Idiocracy actually documentary. going 'Sweden Bad' theme here? guess settles then...a virus infect parasite (lawyer). Found good read here:

 Yeah. Us Americans without proper testing contact tracing. thought found asymptomatic transmission exceedingly rare, pre-symptomatic transmission rare all. Meaning never symptoms, super duper unlikely I've spread anyone, become symptomatic tomorrow may spreading week. mean even play lottery odds. Dude start club? proud American since like 8 saw almost apocalyptic Ship Speech given George Dubya Bush. million plus dead Iraqis. bullied Middle School ""Christian"" kids gay swept rug adults. High School faux Obama lynchings along rust belt, 2016, here.

Were best world right? look like suck ass literally everything blatantly murdering people Saudia Arabia oil? matter; die. Bars barbers opened month big parts Europe, Americans something wrong. No, people don’t want wear masks shooting people ask wear one. would live country dengue alone 1000% infected people, might would get imagination overwhelmed health system is. problem 'developed' nations results cost cutting past result Corona. Many people likely get sick event. require hospital care die, including families may turn infect. 

How GOP think help polls? People fence may look GOP super-spreader events decide want nothing party joyfully kills members. People attending personally affected may also turn back party personally hurt them. sadly unable vote ever again. I'm pretty sure weeks outlawing purchase paint garden mulch made difference here. Maybe Florida Texas try that. killed bunch people’s relatives scared anything outside Ok yea I'm talking states huge disparities cases deaths.

Check Florida example without massive support media empire owned Australian. happy support lying incompetence means potential tax cuts rich.  get shot wearing mask, potentially killing people, well, compassion factor high. I'm furious! grocery store worker, knowing stores closed deaths 2 months ago 65 grocery workers died given little compassion putting personal comfort safety. 

The fact fucking shithead president lead charge this, breaks heart, surprise me. Deaths lag 2 weeks. Deaths slowly start creeping July 13th state's 9/11. playing plague Inc easy mode. normal gave U.S way much credit. Casual mode follows: People extremely careless, wash hands, sick people given hugs, doctors work (In case presumably ppe, wouldn't) mechanic include, crucial factor, carelessness electorate contributes directly incompetance elected officials. assumption excuse containing it. Didnt Pence say good thing case numbers rising young people. Friday weekend?

🤦‍♂️ article says that's charging hospitals. rivalry two shit states. 75,000 extra deaths say? coronavirus spreads unchecked could kill 1% population (3.5 million americans). one going want spend money areas exponential growth economy contract without government shutdown.

The disease definitely worse cure.

How many times cycle need repeat get it? virus can't bargained with. mainly brought want get sidetracked ""pandemic response quality""-measuring contest. Bad bot dont think understands wont second wave Sweden would join you. say try, also, Canadian people saw shouting freedom told isolate. getting freedom. funeral places well. Sounds like going planned. Trump sacrifice tens hundreds thousands ppl precious economy. He's hoping home run vaccine works year remember game playing. amount lives lost could saved ridiculous. guy POTUS, like wtf? Guess makes America great AGAIN. Every lie tell incurs debt truth like watching slowest, biggest, lethal train wreck ever. Usually length time scale disaster war different continent. plan reversed executed all. press conference 11th reporters top questions following eachothers questions dodging left right. even asked take take seriously, still answer. fact closing bunch stuff says worse thought since reluctant even mandate masks didn't. let mayor's finally decided could say mandate it. People suggest he's reacting based trump since shortly Trump's last visit, reopened state early. Raising prices ""price gouging"" thing Guys gotta press charges anyway, plead guilty hope community service+anger management classes.
Worth it. Apparently news dude, literally wrote reason young people affected much less social events.

Which beyond stupid, proportionally represented *before* lockdown. point ever matter. Would cool drag everyone else along them. internet gives us news every day... common timeline vaccine 5 years, coronaviruses never.  panic, good reason expect working vaccine CV19 end next year.  SARS 1, coronaviruses annoying colds.  little incentive sink huge amount money needed try coronavirus vaccine people weren’t disabled dying them. 

Then deadly SARS 1 happened. whole world panicked, heroic hygiene contact tracing isolation efforts , Asia eradicated population.  However, wealthy nations came together study SARS 1 labs, preliminary work vaccine done.  Covid19 caused SARS2 virus, using preliminary SARS 1 vaccine work launch of.

Secondly, revolution physics, chemistry, biology engineering computing power model existing hypothetical molecules, simulate molecules interact materials, molecules body cells.  It’s infallible comes biological processes yet, sure speeds creation new vaccines up.   They’ll still need testing, lot old trial error process compressed months hours. actually almost 9000. day. glad last time public 15 days ago. idea happened 14 days ago must really bad. Whatever happened anyone needed test would provided free government? thread Bill Gates, less. man warned us pandemic back 2015. [WHO contain up-to-date global information. Please refer [Wiki](/r/Coronavirus/wiki/index) additional information FAQ.

Please take down. unreliable biased source information. damage spreading misinformation.  forget huge stupid anti vax population. heard kyrene school district giving parents 3 choices, home schooling, hybrid class. Remdesivir hasn’t even shown survival benefit. dexamethasone treated like magic bullet (at least week ago) actual published research available apart press release. think right. really good outcomes Australia partly due excellent ICU standards, also fact low numbers whole process hospital car park ICU bed calm methodical; less cross-infection staff vulnerable patients occurs due less crowding better staffing. feel like epidemic curve tails survival rates would increase this. live Riverside fuck hear this? It’s different everyone. Look yourself. hard think like put particular front line.

It pass, get back important stuff want do.

Right now, important stuff everyone else needs do, important.

Don't let shagsacks get you, man. documentary point. might imagining. Bu wasn’t reported shit would really hit fan flu met Corona winter? 

Is it? area bay we’ve wearing masks awhile now. Numbers aren’t bad lot outsiders driving could mean positive numbers. much ""partisanship"" one party. one fought tooth nail avoid taking responsible steps deal virus. seemed discover form 2011 atleast took 30000 samples 2011 2019. recently spike workers infected like 10% workers respective plants read right. So, like, world's greatest ever cock block know. almost surreal. think describing happening right B.C. kept numbers super low many seem behave cured here. 

If anything, need extra vigilant business reopened. California warning us. Maybe artists/singers could get backlash forcing fans wear masks. lost deal? *sympathetic noises checking time Rolex signaling security brand new phone* let young kill old! Fellow Oregonian here, recalling stupid hicks took Wildlife refuge government shutdown couple years ago Oregon (granted mob ""led"" Idahoans Nevadans, eastern Oregon board it) mask order CA already. *shrugs* thought regarding coaches. plenty older clearly unhealthy head coaches throughout league. Hell, coach super bowl looks like wouldn’t fun time caught it.

And star player catches middle season? sit 2-3 weeks? Rosters holes every single week new infections pop up. I'm also Michigan governor actually took seriously. look Texas' Florida's numbers show pneumonia influenza deaths skyrocketed past years governors downplayed pandemic. clear evidence states lying numbers. Eh, problems. major overseas colonies. military bases, closed came home, would fairly small number US Citizens coming home. Nothing like India Rhodesia. we'll still big, populous country. started trickle-down. Lol fake make trump look bad Ducey Trump's booty? Obviously paying attention reluctant ducey pandemic know count youth anymore, soon wife protested friends Riverside great environment. early 20s politically active making huge effort get friends involved. Blue matter who! McConnell say anything get reelected  *Cheers newly unfrozen prehistoric virus* seen large groups completely unmasked March.

You saw groups person then? None political doofball bot. Fuck fact-blocking avoid ""political discussions"". inequity ever &amp; see there's problem? Also aren’t “allowed” visit friends house (although that’s enforceable) protesting groups thousands okay. Like literally said that. 

This mayor unhinged capable running city. wonder 10 people would believe social media didn’t exist? Husband got drive thru test Anti body test without charge Miami. test sites least 4 know free. imagine Trump wore encouraged masks. sure, basically pretending nothing happening. far last pandemic lining waiting turn stick... mention climate disaster that’s joined line cracking knuckles. ill early January. took antibody test April— negative antibodies. test emergency authorization rapid test got pulled market. people describing symptoms, I’ve become certain it. loss taste smell almost two weeks, everything else. sure long antibodies detectable, sounds counterintuitive. Wow like nursing home? Thoughts prayers. Sums me, two irreconcilable halves. know. says 'potentially'. Let's least wait numbers Take away random bit choose born America. long born Uber rich.

You want wildest dreams catered to, practically untouchable laws, worry pesky morals.  oh... yes.. thats true..  
I think meant post response comment Hunt? call go house? spreadsheet could hand health department employees contact info ten seconds flat (time stupid Xerox printer warm up). hunt? Would mean leader recommend drinking disinfectant? Exercice, kind home outside, key believe Lina Hildago, really awesome.

Turner little slow toothless lot things, hands also tied governor. could lot worse, could better well. Well. explain Stockholm’s ICUs deaths dropping quickly. time we’re living normally here, almost. 30 % T-response immunity?

I repeat. Sthlm herd immunity. combination t-cell response, antibodies. 50% infected. Hospitalization trending SF Bay Area counties. numbers minuscule compared SoCal. tells second scenario. It’s spelled like : heat make virus go away we’ll June  Fuckin Eh. it’s political statement now, refusing wear mask thing people concerned “freedoms” do. Half americans (or depending live) stupid and/or selfish things others We've hit bad patch think going last long

Keep mind, that's based stated projections science. he's coronavirus expert. He's Trump's **economic advisor.** 

*Why* he's talking press *coronavirus*... know. [has predicting economy he's worse coronavirus predictions: 

In February coronavirus: ""We *contained this*. won’t say airtight pretty close airtight. done good job United States.”

Last week ""So, know, hotspots. *We're it.* know deal stuff now... second wave coming"" 5G here, know. bill smaller..... seems like unreasonablylong time wait...walk-in testing sites NYC CityMD locations typically able get results back 3-5 days (got mine 2 days) never said rich kids.

It's big picture individual choice. hard pill swallow, get it.

But parents choosing children can't properly support provide adds people's hardship. believe working life career preparing children. right gate.

I'm 36 working one first kid. raised step dad taught financially prepared kids. I'm step dad 1, 36 working another kid own. I've raised kids mine.

I never said birth biological children either. adopt good step parent. Money money money money 🤑🤑 Yep, that's called Negative Freedom. absence anything restricting success. Positive Freedom supported succeed laws prevent harmful actions others provision resources increase opportunities. Alas, likely play victim unless there's video evidence

And case, video evidence... Means y'all may end arrested think still restaurants open, allow dine-in customers. Models based early data Italy, Germany seem pretty accurate me, well later Imperial colledge work. agree, models based Wuhan data wrong, models blame though, inputs. still think virus made Chinese lab. anyone wants evidence that: NY + Health insurance costly, good job, going hospital big deal. wracked 25k bills crash. Cost $2500. Simply chose HSA high saying f***** everybody afraid go hospital.

Where? LMAO. subreddit sometimes. America looking like developing country. Try visiting actual developing country know going fresh water from, law enforcement, zero infrastructure. Easy say air-conditioned basement Amazon'ing virtually anything could desire. Grow perspective buddy. think D614G different. Although apparently bit infectious baseline. Still think like humans different skin hair colours, rather separate species.

The main thing D614G seem originated Europe strain circulating Beijing, hence high certainty Beijing outbreak originated source Europe, weather that's salmon something else.

There lot Chinese teams overseas would full time job keep them. recall first team went Italy basically told Italian government ""you call lockdown?"" ended making lockdown strict seems paying now. problem easy suddenly lose access prescription depend on. doctor retires, move new city, change jobs doctor network, get sick drive pharmacy... lots things go wrong. great time *start* kind dependency, might good time discuss cross-tapering something less serious withdrawal.

Obviously want quit meds cold turkey, still worthwhile homework minimize damage case worst-case scenario happens. getting graphs? Masks work 100% efficiency. Even optimistic studies say mandatory masks could reduce transmission 40% locality. Wuhan outbreak could faster bigger. Can't infect anyone orifices melted shut. Good thinking. It’s nice know fellow NJians working brains there. It’ll long time wife indoor dining. don’t want us waist 3 month shutdown nothing. Good sub OP said hospitals currently filling capacity. projected. Looking source current situation. 

But read also interesting appreciate response. That's best worst answer could right now. Best regards, random guy Brazil. Wow dont say. Mississippi worst state bad category nobody wants first place wow that's ordinary. Lol sarcasm Mississippi petri dish stupidity disappointment good day fact dumbest worst state lot categories handling covid19 badly, surprise all. nothing density, though.

Thank proofing me. asshole going clean bidet?? Sweat vector covid 19 spread. Tokyo incredible Japan compliant place--but know, amount tests per day insanely low Shocking. Shocking tell ya. 

Who could’ve predicted this?

Oh yeah. Me. Nah, Brazil Sweden clique. Recent development prominent epidemiologist/virologist math. We're constantly playing catch-up unfortunately. 

Also take look Iran - took 3/4 weeks deaths begin rise cases *second wave* full 6 weeks back previous levels. test catching young cases well catching people get really sick. still higher hopes climate change, mainly something industry fix public short attention span adapts status quo. 

Look auto safety standards. Nobody cares anymore cars seat belts, airbags, longer use leaded gasoline. God knows many lives saved improved. big stink happened, but...life goes drops radar. 

People care electricity comes long there's electricity. Industry *always* complains change cause prices skyrocket put business, yet always find way grumbling. safer food now, safer cars, safer buildings. Someday safer power.

But shooting makes literally exactly bad guy shot someone wearing mask. That's meant. national average cases per population slightly lower daily cases per pop CA. Arizona however 3x national average per population.

Some numbers based yesterday's Worldometer reporting:

CA: 175 cases/M/day

US: 135 cases/M/day Masks effective protecting others yourself. I’m (BC Canada) 26 new cases yesterday, it’s still finding way care homes. 80% America still power work till 80 think there's way out. people constantly going across state lines, we’re essentially nothing.

Seriously. fucking hate guy. Aha, found really get reported western media, understand asking.

Here's stats 27 days last weeks lockdown Shulan, 43 confirmed cases COVID-19 found, 36 since recovered, one died. Currently 6 remain treatment isolation. time high risk area remaining China Fengman District Jilin City.

Aww, 6 hospital 8, remembered wrong. unclear people got covid protest tested positive protest.

Did likely spread extent? Yeah. outdoors masks far shown least viable spread.

It's likely spread protest overlap people protested people socially distancing ways. likelihood 2.5% people protested caught low though. 2/5/20, CDC, established 75 years, best best wrong, states predict widespread community spread (per title OP) yet point time maintained one needs wear mask public outwardly advised public wear mask... 

Title read: ""CDC LIABLE WIDESPREAD COMMUNITY SPREAD SARS-COV-2 THOUSANDS DEATHS. CDC INTENTIONALLY MISINFORMED PUBLIC EFFORT PREVENT HOARDING MASKS PUBLIC GOING HOARD MASKS ANYWAY. 

What joke. 

DEFUND CDC!!!!!! prefer call ""swell"". shit dudes dudettes. primary issue argument value returned based price set Gilead.

They could claim drug costs $1m, getting back $125 billion value $70m investment logic. Link says “page found” me. percent positive rate going too, sadly no. 

We've testing free available everyone since late May/early June though I'm sure meaningful comparisons March/April/May be.

However, we're definitely worse month ago scary discouraging say least. Automod gets triggered word removes comment matter context it’s said :/ Everybody pays taxes. need tips customers stop talking altogether :) La county stop coming Santa Barbara. 

You bringing you. Regardless low tell real risk. respect social distancing future... Let's face it, life never like used while. I’m school nurse. disaster. That's city can't actually anything, state cab Probably done 3 months ago. based on? hell yeah, conviction I’m saying people wear masks. safe would say without social distancing (outdoors, w/ masks) US needs coherent message every top official: ""Wear mask. Stay home much possible."" 

That message alone would save LOT lives. talking about? severe lack access testing states unlike rest world. US doomed TABC likely look way long donate right people 10 hours later :( Seriously, one biggest vectors Way people salt river weekend well enough, need go outside, turn around three times spit. hands now.

Asking friend. love every fucking subreddit Reddit shoves throat front page r/politics circlejerk everyone shits U.S. get virtual internet points.

Anyone uses subreddit seriously point see glaring bias echo chamber needs serious reality check bad website gotten hospitals start running equipment manpower, mortality goes up.

Doesn't matter spare beds can't care patients Donated billions get tax breaks doesn’t taxes billions - getting donate entire fortune ? let’s real - buffet bezos much wealth whole bottom half population combined (source: inequality.org) makes money “donations” aside tax breaks, organizations invests in, often result economic return trust. fact people don’t see actually blows mind. interesting quagmire sure turn , economy China unlikely (fully) recover long time.

sadly truth.

China try embrace infrastructure projects, short term solution. Let man go 100 day aged steak already think absolutely right. really need remove stigma associated programs. definitely add social assistance addiction. Lord knows small fraction last bank bailout could done it.

Hate speech regulated United States. fact, supreme court ruled protected 1st amendment once. confusing hate speech hate crimes. 1) value ""testing"" stated. 

2) efficacy masks social distancing exaggerated.

3) mass delusion ability stop virus.

4) People need remember most, mild disease.

5) Especially vulnerable persons must remain isolated. enough people getting infected daily testing really useful anymore. That's point already need surge capacity ready. Incompetent reality star president.

Hyperpolitical environment people getting information increasingly biased sources. 

Decades undermining disease control agencies hur-durr guberment bad. 

Science illiteracy mistrust experts. 

Me, me, culture complete disregard people community that's bordering malignant narcissism. 

People afraid go hospital due insane prices. 

An unhealthy population tons risk factors.

Covid really perfect storm expose wide range issues US has. Well well well someone let brainwashed completely wrong. Groan! much work! Okay guys... we've practicing this... Everyone loves cure devastating illnesses... right ask get paid. 

Then you’re worse Hitler, according Reddit. That's China initially waited see against. found fast spread, lethal was, locked entire country matter days.

Rest world upon seeing that? ""China overreacting.""  keep hearing talk travel bubbles, seems countries open borders countries still virus circulating, lesser degree.

Thing is, got cases 0, really really want keep things way, *any* risk seem intolerable you. lot anti mask protests back. many tears local news pages everything open weak people die 🙄 Hold seat folks, US going pedal metal!  Damn yo, even OP. There's like, literally dozens you, huh? Fortunately much smaller minority think bud “we”? work one largest school districts AZ certainly get two weeks breaks. Winter break longer yes, aligns national standard colleges universities also follow. Schools required session certain amount days vary state state that.

 reduction mortality rate 4%

Feel free correct I'm wrong, I'm sure interpreting results paper correctly. 

The paper says Kaplan-Meier estimates mortality 14 days 7.1% remdesivir 11.9% placebo

This reduction 4%, reduction around 40% placebo mortality rate 11.9% reduced 7.1% (i.e 60% 11.9 7.1 seen 40% decrease). 

You can't subtract raw numbers. example, hypothetical scenario mortality remdesivir 0% placebo 11.9% say reduction mortality 11.9%, would say remdesivir reduced mortality 100% since 0 people would died. average stay ICU patient 3.4 days. feel ppl fully understand ICU used for. article helpful. 

ICU mean life death all. first hand experience. Texas stay open anyway say fuck law (who anything it). 
 
Send help. humidity parts Midwest joke. People moving visiting always end surprised harsh summers get. Lucky lives one humid areas Michigan. miss days kid living house without AC battle humidity fans. main argument ""well covid patients!!!"" 

Which.... obvious. critical conditions magically go away pandemic. concern back March. surge COVID effect care non covid get aswell. know ‘immunity’ comes absurd amount death right?

This isn’t flu. every 100 infections someone dies. New York City [10+ seroprevalence, nowhere even close herd immunity. Despite this, 0.2% city’s population died virus. [Half New know someone died. 

A well thought TEMPORARY shutdown far better mass death crowded hospitals. Without way slow spread, hospitals become overwhelmed. hearing what’s happening Houston, Miami, Phoenix? Hospitals quickly filling without effective way slow spread. overcrowded hospitals comes increased mortality rate health system cannot treat anybody. point, April dozens US cities strained healthcare systems lot working well capacity. shutdown way prevent getting overwhelmed, worked, even NYC. it’s irresponsible states reaching capacity again.

Besides, asking we’re going shutdown every time there’s outbreak isn’t much valid question. There’s many variables, shutdown right get new cases point track trace virus suppress spread. Like wack-a-mole. requires shutdown. Medicaid OC checking here. Please send help way 🤦🏻‍♀️ could someone ELI5 means terms progress towards pandemic over? tried get it, *very* technical reading I'm bit hazy exactly means (as in, what's difference ""hyperimmune serum"" producing antibodies vaccine same).

Sorry bother! Cool picked perfect social-distancing vehicle himself. closed couple weeks, reopened. 

This doesn’t none anyone know find data (preferably .csv format, anything do) results Antibody tests? Can't seem find anywhere. 1) Nicaragua South American.

Regarding Covid-19, Europe 43 countries officially fewer deaths per million US. 

The US decent place live good income health insurance, objectively deteriorating troubling ways. Better late never suppose. Started r/G4SwineFlu No, protecting country involves strong organization messaging, mention strong civic values. none that. Governor ordered it. She’s leaving local law enforce it. Mannnnn swine flu back 2009... sucked lol places probably still field hospitals set up. unlikely either equipment people give ICU-level care, though. Surge-capacity ICU beds (mentioned another comment) far less numerous would help mitigation scenario unless R value much lower now.  Kentucky...the south different world lol. Masks completely optional here- even places posted mask required. Oh man bunch people exercising constitutional rights. hope none supported black lives matter protests would hypocritical you. place echo chamber.

Y’all bunch sheep. Yep year. survived 4 5 layoffs. goes remind everyone organism never encountered man, still much learn it. repeat Spanish Flu. years, cities responded wisely, obstinate got fucked.

If enemy biological weapon, think faux patriots would problem masks. intentionally pick ""Billy"" (Microsoft) Xbox example? tried sneaking own? wish could help, many us do. wrong! Thank behalf helped you. I’m another state, damndest stay healthy make things harder. Let know way others might help. know sew fabric masks. r/Masks4All  good sub, maybe  ideas. Ducey way close “Douche” me. must living simulation. Cannot

Thinking cops wear masks unless they're covering badges. Dude. Read again. sarcastic. Also, I’m Chinese. Oh joy. Cue another round ""we're fucked"" posts. never see enough those. Comments like US still seeing spikes even 6 months opportunity learn do.

No one ever lost money betting stupid dumbfuckistanis living dumbfuckistan are. Tf on? Restaurants bars open takeout since shit began Depends rails road. Oh fuck u who. Take yourChina bs back China mean totally ignoring virus work? I'm shocked /s what? Great. really corknavirus thing, Right, criticism China shutdown pneumonia clusters detected December non-sensical. country shutdown every suspected infectious disease, that'd 300 days year. basically repost. It’s different summary study, probably hundred posts made. It’s copypasta now. Cuomo 24,000 dead almost 10x Texas. hell great job? are... What's point? people charged held accountable? Weak sentencing, what? never followed case beyond shocking initial details. dont 'control'. 

We're even testing asymptomatic persons like US does.

We're testing people symptoms(which 2% infections according dutch CDC')

So possible ran course here. take many infections deaths population 328 million people 17 million people that's though pill swallow. Exactly I’ve saying too, like saw bad Italy got. think go back normal things fine we’re afraid cold? shutdown going happen, probably end lot restaurants covid control. Great work. LPT: like employer make sure report violations. New Jersey, promise dumb without alcohol. friend go crowded beach, crowded bar, sleep one bedroom apartment 20 (no exaggeration) people beach bar. reading right older age groups basically fall line expected deaths even COVID? obligatory [relevant onion   That's right.

1. superspreader infected lot people slaughterhouse, 

2. Workers came home infected families, 

3. Family members infected others community. 

That's virus spreads efficiently. mean 15 people remaining country? rate everyone either gonna die illegally emigrate Mexico  Pretty much everyone Deaths per million U.S 2.5 right now. Europe whole 0.5. Think handful countries worse us.

The last two days funny jump stats sure death rate pretty much flat. Since cases rise would reasonable think overall deaths go down.

It sucks. want like ignoring data change Government conspiracy? know, classic case paranoid delusion. Yes I'm sure heart attacks stop clear deal covid. 


That always point. ICUs handle many critical conditions, adding covid quickly push edge. L.A. super aggressive almost day one, CA. Way states past peaks fine.

Eh...this explanation bit pigeon simple. agree LA opened early, looking deaths per million people, California one better states in. afford it. parents can. Lol ever get good news adult holds child accountable death real problem. thinking also.

New study Sweden talks study T-cell antibodies (not picked current antibody tests) showing 30% folks tested. This, something random like MMR vaccine providing partial immunity (or both) might making herd immunity far lower currently thought. Yeah, shifted curve.

There dexamethasone (while supplies last?) seems help little chunk lag real. :( impact anything said above? Specifically, claim relying contact tracing BLM attendees?

As far tell, none.

Don't regurgitate talking points. Engage discussion. Yes. fb friend Texas posts constantly living best Texas life. Today posted go fund best friend husband contracted died quickly. Maybe skip salon week. adoption non-border-based, science-based actions call ""being bullied""?

Better would give kid shit ton Legos home. parents might die stepping kid would probably thrilled. im joining religion argue details I’m guessing we’re page - wear damned masks, people! wear masks, even lower quality poorly configured masks protect people. Get done. ""There countries ""have done well""

""The countries ""have done well"" less populous""

Now I'm confused. Yeah, really quiet first half April, May 1 people starting get antsy re-opening. Ducey went 0-100 reopening instead sort gradual phased reopening. Cares act apply healthcare related employers. provision states recommended provide paid time follows cares act, employers mandated like industries. Smh. Canada great, Ontario, terrible shape still isn’t ideal condition since it’s province matters, well... Yes....

It seems Westerners never understand matter, common knowledge China. willing sacrifice peoples livelihoods wait something never come.

The government care you, form government ever will, primary purpose never save YOU. human human spread, around several years now. need panic I’m teacher, too. That’s said it. school board covered reopening plan today, basically, there’s protection teachers. agree virus, PPE like gets soiled. constantly exhaling bacteria builds inside. filtration efficiency decreases time fluid resistance also degrade time.

We go far hospital, even look industries regularly use gloves masks. used work manufacturing floor. put gloves entered cleanroom (not even semiconductor Class 100 level yet, Class 1000 10000), beard guards masks. We'd toss ever got dirty time inside certainly way out. put new pair coming back whether went break, went bathroom, etc.

I know sounds like waste, that's PPE used, across Asia treated. understand early pandemic US massive shortage masks PPE, we're months road now. still super easy find PPE although drug stores regularly masks lot online sources. started March April reusing masks period week least tossing them, since able buy boxes 50 disposable masks, put one car, another house use one per day toss them. feels far cleaner way.

In ways look US masks third world nation. great country can't come supply chain ensure citizens get enough masks resort home-made remedies, every developed nation Asia using shelf products. understand developing starving nation, certain point look countries done masks right beginning today. That's pisses fucking most. I'm AZ every last advocate re-opening say? ""Well, can't lock FOREVER! ECONOMY SUFFER!""

This worst fucking ""I told so"" history ever. think wanted stay home I'm hippy ""doesn't dig 9-5, man""? want economy shut either! income also depends economy! wanted us shut May June economy would suffer greater losses later! feel like I'm taking fucking crazy pills here!!! Thanks. brain went nope.nope.nope. barely enough N95s healhcare workers.

Edit: downvote away, agree tell TVs nice actually cardio gym. I'm sorry Wisconsin I'm probably cardio gym portion year.

But would lieing want planet fitness town. much cheaper. hate do(pizza parties like) bang buck would hard pass up. lol doomers....

god dammit name tired

listen, fucking virus aint gonna contained like got third country fucking unemployed right now, close up, economy goes bye bye asses, ya dig?

All live virus wild, wear mask, pray dont get sick die shit time get enough decent meds belt use....

thats it. wont herd immunity letting fucker rip, sure.

Actually think it, already letting rip us stupid assholes dont wear masks.... dont shit exposure time seconds 30+ minutes required UVC kill sample. previous peak, April, lag one week. talking two *months*. clue like Cali, state end April 45+ accounted 51% confirmed cases yesterday 37%, new confirmed cases past 2 months 44 younger here. Median age death 78. Parties sloppy hookups that. I’m NorCal mercifully less attractive antisocial. Wtf mean let others take care me? work healthcare, including positive patients.

But everyone else needs stay home. Living pause. they're others take care them. They're taken care taxes paid already pay safe again. try justify losing people disease moral obligation self supportive makes pretty angry. New cases fact spiking. tell looking curve.

That Wall Street Journal article joke. mostly outlines things Cuomo great (4th state country issue lockdown) saying slow response. tries blame issues federal guidelines (CDC allow testing, guidelines hospital patients needing return nursing homes). press want people think BLM protest negative effect, even regards Covid-19. mention CDC also said true number infected likely 10 times higher.... 100% going happen. Senior year looking like L He'll pardon them, lol.

They're Wall Heroes! It’s fucking dangerous make claims like these. Things like 100% going get people killed. 

I mean, situation AZ hospitals 2 days ago. It’s getting worse... think so. intro computer science classes always frowned solutions coding assignments someone took 'the long way' get job done. Exactly teacher. Sure. not. better going dying rich millionaire fuckwad make quick buck. quite understand Westerners always speculate China's behavior worst case scenarios.

Maybe read lot reports media, mainland China really interfere suppress Westerners way real life?

Other selling Westerners Chinese-made goods (in fact profits made importers), mainland China interaction Westerners?

What China deserves much resentment West? understand.

I came reddit mainstream western media completely failed convey useful information (if conveyed badly Wuhan caught attention governments then, instead ridiculing it, think different would now) u/UndeleteParent mean, reasoning pubs easily applied gyms. Doubly actually, gyms net positive peoples' health society large, pubs simply benefit society overall (I understand there's social benefit, can't discounted, harms outweigh this). good cardio also probably helps ones chances coronavirus. 5 republics far history france, every time major crisis engulfs country state gets reformed meet needs french nation. 

meanwhile people can't even agree whether wear masks US, let along comes US republic said say again....wearing mask like wearing condom. don’t understand people don’t grasp that. Aaaand it’s gone so? I’m honestly wondering, trying sarcastic way. Sure. not? people prison. people willingly spreading infectious virus causing problems everyone. Alex who? Even Southern California. San Bernardino county mixed bag. Yeah Rancho Cucamonga. San Bernardino basically Oakland Compton somehow smaller. Also Redlands Yucaipa. Hesperia *shudders*. California ain’t avocado toast Bernie sanders. Nah. another lockdown re-enforce peoples' minds necessary. Benadryl would probably sold ridiculous gas station prices. article read November 2019 Covid-19 said exact thing, still, hopeful never becomes big deal. coworker wears face shield purpose. That's need tax rich people use money things society believe important, instead relying help people charity (because charity always get results want). that's another discussion. Anyone looked N95 masks work would disagree characterization benefit “minuscule"".

A well fitting mask literally first thing sort n95 documentation point explain wear effectively. Anyone even looked N95 got name google understand incredibly effective.

They also still available Ebay (sometimes Asian KN95 version available) like $6-10 one reused often long hours end stored handled correctly. us running shopping coming right back home use one mask quite time since used 30 mins time.

Now turn cloth masks, use N95 hard find locally. said 3 layers cotton 70% effective compared N95 - still effective. Anyone walking single thin piece home-made mask might helping (much), people following guidelines absolutely making difference.  gonna get rona mask yikes. perspective, 9 states (including CA obvi) populous LA county. 

So fucked massive number people high case count tiny bit less awful context. mean latter, everyone catching it? fda ""fast tracked"" drug too. Meanwhile banning use hcq last week. 

Quite coincidence. really much. contract tracing shown even barber, doctor, chiropractor, nail salon covid case unlikely spread high rate mitigation taken seriously. business direct contact low end.  

Entertainment venues, clubs, bars, casinos, restaurants basically anywhere indoors groups people can't mitigate big issues. 1 1 places great seem manageable.

All said az full shut stats per cdc guidelines. Interesting. annoying. use deductive (or inductive?) reasoning skills figure lists about. New Zealand form lockdown restriction inside borders. borders closed foreigners New Zealanders(who quaratine) trade continuing normal. stage wait see rest world does. case, it’s pronounced like “air” “heir”. English great.. Yes keeps coming Sadly 3&amp;4 seem relevant people. Supply chain issues. Asia  people “bored” restrictions. Statistically even, 44 deaths state close 40 million people means risk death super low. But, shouldn’t even matter take simple precautions prevent spreading people. 

The issue lot people look 44 new deaths say “well, that’s many, won’t me!” Love it. permission use one work tomorrow? arrest people refusing wear masks, job 5¢/hr serve involuntary 14day quarantine? I'm worried country. keep seeing people claim testing equals cases. Well, duh. doesnt make situation better. cant comprehend people still downplaying this. administration done shit job, killed 120k citizens, yet people still supporting government saying stop living fear. seriously think need delete social media anxiety bad this. horrible feeling since January first heard china know selfish American citizens are. Live event professionals broadway show crew do....read whole statement. Going fun small group friends largely social distancing sounds fun. Camping would probably better cabin, sound like huge risk. irritating people actually masks car. like know required mask car still walk store without it? Idiots. ""Making perfect enemy good."" I've never heard phrase really like it, thanks teaching me! Damn socialized medicine even doctors take second jobs! vaccine probably ready December. PLA already starting vaccinate. keep lid things another 6 months so. course, China doesn’t antivaxxer problem like America does. I’ve reasonable smart people friend group straight say they’re going take covid-19 vaccine. fucking plague rats listen look yourself. course. Everyone would support that. there's zero chance Trump agreeing it. feel like trump likely join face mask rally. Shocking it, knew...

All people heading gym packing bars heroes book, acting test dummies big reopening experiment.

Spoiler alert




Test failed people realize like playing Russian Roulette shooting base spine instead head?

If ""lose"" could afflicted disability rest life, even live. worth gamble ALL.

Idiots!! states increasing numbers probably best position though. positive rate fairly stable around 5-6%, really increased much cases risen. seem like disease still spreading quite bit, definitely bad Florida, Texas, Arizona, etc. Servers &amp; cooks make $800/day? Where? TBF though going gym 5 times week add several hundred calories onto amount burn day, long run add several hundred onto that. Yeah, know much Tiananmen, democracy, rights....they know much allowed know, say hello censorship state controlled everything. Hello little troll, poor ignorant soul...hope latter. Maybe I've seen many movies like Independence Day thought humanity would inspiring times like lol... Hopefully alien invasion added list problems face 2020. remember civics teacher 22 years ago saying eventually US would collapse like every republic democracy it. hoping life time. stop calling people conspiricists call actually are, paranoid delusionists! Oh okay understood now. Okay benefits elected, people don’t vote them, don’t get keep job next election cycle. 

Obviously, many handling whole virus situation well taking appropriate precautions, Americans super bright either think whole thing hoax people still vote too.

That’s could benefit politicians think YouTube comments referring shut down. several hours videos, covers seconds many them. Frills (to me) would updated/modern/fancy cardio equipment built-in TVs stuff, organized group classes (yoga, pilates, etc), sauna/steamroom, massage, things along lines. place solid free weight section, use for, well basic cardio machines. seriously finding walking around mask ""hard enough"" seriously need get shape.. Maybe focus actually giving shit blue collar workers safety rather tossing couple bucks running mindless television ads stating safe work Amazon right now. PR games Bezos playing right downright insulting. Agreed.  fuck people drinking alcohol supposed wear fucking mask? even close. see Palm Beach council meeting crazy citizen comments?
[citizens comments/palm used live one ""mountain” counties I've watching tracker anxiously, thinking little tiny county hospital used work there. 

Wash hands. Wear mask. Stay 6 feet apart stores shopping early late. Tell county supervisors county health officer want masking ordinances all.  read article already. Ditching Trump step positive direction. Ah yes, beaches. sunshine saltwater plentiful. I'm bringing back original American hobo lol find steady work Vegas jumped gayhound SLC sleeping bagging get DL back still wash everyday wear clean clothes save money camping easy get used wanna nice truck nice small RV work build rez buy cheap rural land thing check I’m error. noted protection levels depended model. Surgical Masks designed protect wearer. Surgeons wear prevent germs contaminating anything. basic idea prevent droplets mouth nose reaching other. they’re fucking blackmailing contributing politicianscampaigns It’s seriously like half people can’t follow that.. Brick mortar, assume. Setting bar real low there, Texas There's that, there's also fact USA (and nations) lived waaaaaay beyond means decades, insurmountable debts already went pandemic/recession huge deficits, they're already unmanageable, even interest rates 0%.

So yeah, sorry, unproductive quarantine income anyone, basically. Shoobies too!  bullshit. need heard immunity, shutdowns. something essential living, making living though.

I agree assessment it’s preferable get covid get Covid, actually proposing solution, nihilistic “shut everything virus goes away, let others take care me”? Sometimes think true. Also hospital try screw much possible. overcharged $600 local hospital (medical bills clear mud hadn’t realized met pocket max... month paid realized contacted them) took 6 months get pay back despite calling repeatedly pleading money. better believe taken 6 months pay would pay interest... them...nope. kept $600 six months finally cut check first year. Crooks. I'll give us That’s precisely issue, amend perspective bit:

The effects climate change already here. know happens don’t start changing NOW. 

The effects Covid here, too. know happens, see differences happened countries heeded warnings, not. 

The issue takes tragedy hit Americans individual level they’ll believe things real actually alter behavior. Anything beyond sob story happens “other countries,” “other people,” never them.

There deeply disturbing fundamental ignorance engrained American culture. long Civilization turns? I’m sick coopers shit. Stay indoors 5 months let protesters others party. Dumbass *Gasp!* scandalous! Yikes LOL Please go. mean putting heads sand isn’t solution? dont even get paid criminal NCAA resume sports Cant think many nonessential reasons travel place like hawaii. think there's one group see it. Also, asymptomatic end getting shot put ICU test positive, hospital list hospital COVID19 even though that's there? know murders suicides skyrocketing right? Funny hospitals surging month, average time infection death 18.5 days deaths reflect that. Maybe hospital COVID19 bc COVID19. 

And tell takes long time record deaths. There's outliers everything CDC says 7 days national mega daily dosage vitamin would pretty much eliminate problem altogether, along added benefit many people discovering conventional medicine regard health building pretty much failure. super stud 20 y/o athletes won’t die, moot point. someone spent time countries observed normal drinking cultures

I'm curious, countries visited locals get together drinks there? come too? Schmaked Arizona big fires going already (with smaller ones between) even fourth July. I'm hoping Ducey shutting things we'll see less activity, people took top one another recreational spots everything closed down, I'm holding breath.

Edited add: Firework tents place too. SMH. Like, can't even responsible enough keep virus spreading, yet continue put firestarters people's hands.  Live dumbshit redneck state Deep South insisted reopening early May. went 90 cases 2,000 cases around thirty days less.  said part turd mayor said mandate masks want ""violate anyone's personal freedoms...""

Clownworld confirmed. course, would expect less.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

Unfortunately, game, death one prizes ""won"".

Sigh.... drug tax payer dollars went towards creating. pharma industry fucking disgusting money grubbing. don’t understand Kayleigh McEnany wasn’t struck lightning saying everything control. rarely see warnings emerge phase 3.

Did ever, point, state anything refuting point? simply said concerns Oxford vaccine's progress, would said something now. know combative doctor declaring vaccine safe everyone.

Maybe not. dad, runs medical school, is. uncle, who's cardiologist. aunt critical care nurse intensive care unit front lines fighting virus since April. aunt, works nursing home head nurse there. half-aunt nurse practitioner. They're pretty confident vaccine ready end year *no* agency going say ""here, take this!"" without knowing does, happened lucked Oxford midway coronavirus vaccine could tinkered bit compatible hypothetically combat SARS-Covid-2 proven safe effective. vaccine close (potentially) available mass inoculation.

As accusations me, I'd much appreciate quit coming knives take fricking chill pill. reading statements though speak learned professionals know they're talking say say. say anything public forum without fact-checking, thanks. Join condo board near see action. Everyone really ample time build makeshift hospitals NYC started building theirs. There’s excuse this. couldn’t figure months ago? Seriously think it. incompetent? Something feels me. would want destroy country? mean.. may case marches, look pictures events see mask wearing universal may seemed. real Weekend Bernies sequel set-up ask me. Definitely this. husband went get hair cut yesterday (first time since quarantine) woman cutting hair said, ""Covid? see Covid. think real."" 

My husband currently counting days knows haircut killed him. What’s .4% 8 billion? 🤦‍♀️ happening Michigan months ago. good friend nurse said scariest weeks life. ...how South Dakota decrease cases never lockdown???? today? hope self isolation enough avoid that.

But risk especially potentially big C. ...in normal times.

But Trump Crime organisation corners market bets off.

Read article raises possiblity discouraged, can't fix stupid ignorant Trump cultists reply way senate stupid enough refuse extending it, would foolish comment. Yeah, India another country people seem whatever fuck want there, less consequences. US least people try shame comply. get impression way India. I've heard multiple stories people saying cops openly solicit bribes give change bribe one cares. Exactly this. plenty friends I'm contact frequently antisocial introvert ass wants be, get yelled digital equivalent drunk uncle Thanksgiving. I'm incredibly frustrated people. also hurt, clear value life lives anyone else higher risk. Bonus watching/listening make fun of/dismiss us following guidelines.

It really make angry.

A month ago, conversation co-worker another area claimed able get good information. talked finding vetting good info sources, wanted ""agree disagree."" told agree disagree risks someone's ability live life. gave 0 fucks. surprise nobody. Wear masks social distance. much love great teachers maybe great... many kids getting harmed school would better latch-key kids? Putting kids big mob school help IMO. better thinking that's even possible. Trade one another works think rest world get reguardless? echo arguments I've made elsewhere.

A.) bar exam jack shit ethics. Almost everyone took MPRE 2L summer. Bar exam barely touches ethics concerns.

As exam competence....

1. Bar exam terrible sorting competence. \~90% graduates pass within two years. remaining 10% going include people take financial reasons since, know, pay absurd amounts prepare take exam (I pay $125 **privilege** using laptop essays, rather writing). exam actually sort many people. went diploma privilege, probably conditioned something like supervised work attorney graduation high pass rate school, letting barbarian hordes incompetent lawyers, largely people probably going pass *regardless*. 
  1. us arguing taking we'll fail. We've paid $2,000+ commercial prep courses could train *rock* pass bar exam. We're arguing *pointless.*
2. also test competence substantive manner. MBE (multiple choice portion) 25 multiple choice questions per subject area. trust lawyer handle criminal case got five questions right Criminal Law section.
3. That's right, five questions. see, Bar Exam aggregates score sections. long aggregate score hits cutoff, good go. cutoff? Usually around \~65%, varying depending state. miss *a lot* given section, make others, still get licensed. That'd fine, except screw particular area law, go practice area law.
4. exam horrendously unreflective law practice conditions. go work, spend 60 minutes (recommended time per essay) determining approach client's case, would get sued client malpractice. Furthermore, something happens trial objecting to, judge going stop say ""Okay counselor, two options support objection, two would overrule it. They're worded terribly effort trip up. one correct?"". 
  1. emphasize, goes ""BUT EXAM INTEGRITY"" argument made online: people looking stuff hardly cheating context lawyers. doctor needs know body works without looking stuff up, people go living dead matter moments. Attorneys typically work urgent timeframe. never going moment need know validity Rule Perpetuities hour. Lawyers *supposed* perform research client, argue *based law, gut*. one care bar exam open book.
   1. underscore this, things memorize closed book test quickly lost again, go unused exam. public-benefit purpose requiring exam takers memorize inane legal trivia. 
5. arguments ""I X person know it, too"" frankly stupid argument. completely side step real debate test competence people protecting interests jackass rear ends you, instead resort blind tradition. something way done generations, speak worth system. Keep mind, slavery long period time, justify keeping it.
  1. Furthermore, protectionist. ""Well, X person got advantage system excludes people participating, therefore keep advantage"". Protectionism *terrible* argument. established attorneys entitled advantage passing arbitrary test gave didn't. suck take stupid exam? Yes. justify dicking next group graduates assuage feelings forced hazing ritual? No. 
6. current events level, let's use example Florida, I'm currently slated take exam here. know two regions fastest growth rate infections country? Why, regions Tampa Orlando, places Florida Bar offered! Several hotels already closed, available stay exam (it's multi-day exam way!). Best hope hotel close either!
  1. Also better hope one goes rocking asymptomatic infection, deliberately suppressing symptoms like fever Tylenol.
  2. Also, get hot waiting line get (1200 people, six feet apart), better hope trigger temp check, taking exam *you need work* February, Florida offering back date!

The bar exam joke, widely regarded amongst attorneys, least, I've discussed with. Pandemic aside, long overdue change, given garbage impression public attorneys, obviously done good job regulating profession benefit public, fails actually ensure competency taking it. Pandemic back in, reckless hell demand observance stupid tradition accomplish purports *will put lives risk*.

And keep mind, us taking July? would love anything else. However, caught able support ourselves, health ourselves, family, country. mother grandmother terrible lungs, get choose risking them, risking able afford place live. what? exam many non-lawyers (clients) even aware first place, many professionals think joke? courts decide extend remote trials, Florida Bar avoid convention person, law schools extend online semesters, Texas Bar Exam employees allowed avoid proctoring exam health risk, law school graduates avoid pressured take exam? hospitalizations growing exponential rate, exponential rate increasing.

Over past week, daily growth rate hospitalizations Texas approximately 8.5% per day. That's doubling rate less 9 days. virus likely came Europe. Stop blaming China. China first warn world, got shit it. past couple weeks already weren't, feel like next several weeks going even crucial. rest 2020 beyond going defined actions governments, local otherwise, take. something going happen terms mandate masks series lockdowns, needs happen *now*. Can't afford short manpower impending war India. could crucial strategic advantage critical misstep leading undesired effects road think India right want them. know hate people wear masks, they're morons, agree. BUT, think mechanism what's going Southern California different. believe message begin reopening meant working class people (who disproportionately latinx\_ go work. Work homes sealed air conditioned socal, making transmission easier. working class people tend live denser areas, that's bad too. 

The bulk problem economic inequality side effects. governor let counties open soon, counties opened soon, biggest problem poor people cannot skip another week work cannot live way mitigate spread. need serious economic changes treat workers mitigate sort problem future. I’m curious many people sticking protocol get sick anyway. Docs/Nurses etc never reach numbers. There's still enough testing allow many... I'm ridiculed wearing mask i'll first person say ""Told ya so"" things get worse. That’s.... exact definition “desensitized” situation. Well, I'm happy report I'm neither Chinese paid posting Reddit. Yeah, welll....good luck that! Masks useless protect getting virus still communicated.

The intent fabric masks prevent transmission people people mild symptoms. time shortage PPE one region USA outbreak significant size, better people quarantine place rather wear mask could used medical staff. *laughs Canadian* shits happening take place too. Karens freaking everywhere. Dork Smart Doesn’t mean they’re testing positive attending protests week getting point Texas many videos showing videos patients hallways happened NYC. Give us another 7-10 days similar scenes hopefully dire Covid treatment gotten bit better.

That said, bets numbers continue increase. fair, current government UK pretty adept taking advantage medical staff disregarding concerns well (though system overall surprisingly robust considering much damage it). core problem governments prioritize money human wellbeing, whether that's form profits budget cuts. typical dining. Thanks reply.

A slow motion tsunami, that's effective visualization, since seems taking around 4 weeks change/infection seeing results, makes really hard see/understand/realize what's happening/being seen today, actually happened/started around 4 weeks ago.

Things might different effective leadership starting top, also better/more testing effective contact tracing system, don't, stuck onus left individuals businesses, instead gov't. well ""Merica! many us seem unable figure real news/information, instead getting caught science denial, comes top/national leadership, people's minds closed off/set, easy thing open change.

I totally agree worst public health crisis 100 years, wonder history books going treat people look future.

There lot things ""known"" Spanish Flu pandemic 100 years ago, goes along way towards ""explaining"" how/why things ended bad, time think ""not knowing"" going work/fly well.

I hope things somehow magically start changing, things end bad things appear heading.

But end, what's going happen happen, guess us think right families/households.

Be strong, safe well! “own lying eyes” Wow! Incredible terrifying anyone would straight mandating masks time like this. feel like US going cesspool indefinitely. Poor rats, still get blamed something fault :) Ug, links twitter thread.

STOP F'ING LINKING TWITTER THREADS. dont pay kids, risk brain damage death entertainment. thd name higher education corruption! Yay NCAA. white guy steal billions schools. cook sneezes container touch container eat hands, could get would think? Likely? Probably not, still. fair, think they've documented covid spread food date. seems like fix introduce new, wild breeding stock lab mice strain. ditch start mice field. Yep. Especially potentially life death, sometimes hard face people pretend hope somehow goes away. Happens time. understanding Abbot's orders. Either way, they're currently phase 1 ""sustainable surge"" definitely move ""unsustainable surge"" soon probably end overcapacity. Protest spread still irrelevant drop bucket compared reopening spread. 🤷‍♀️ 100% yes. need know it’s going available long point pandemic ends. then, every day depression misery.

I also want know protective it’s going often get shot going forward (one done, year, multiple times year, etc.

Anything past twice year sounds dystopian TBH. Or, know, could cancel season expect infection rate can't nice things. tacos certainly ""nice things"". Go European countries mask-wearing practically nonexistent. Get mart cart, walking losers. incredibly troubling (and likely) possibility. changed position shamed op-ed NYT socoglogist. evidence needed make clear call wearing even homemade TShirt masks better masks months before. cases high. it’s masks this. It’s dine gyms open. Nah, don’t need waste money that, release meth gators. /s haven’t seen anything supports protests behind recent surge. Gotcha!!

j/k Long-lasting side effects surviving corona norm - mean points making valid exaggerate situation try win point. even worse. increase 620 people hospital currently. obviously lots people discharged past 24 hours, number new hospitalizations would significantly higher 620. See...that's thing...many people using freedoms CHOOSE ventilator. /s still scientific proof RNA sequences causative agent called COVID-19.

In order establish causal connection, one way other, i.e. beyond virus isolation purification, would absolutely necessary carry experiment satisfies four Koch’s postulates. experiment.

So far, studies done assumed RNA viral.

The CDC FDA admit much.

In [“CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic file March 30, 2020, example, says:

*Detection viral RNA may indicate presence infectious virus 2019-nCoV causative agent clinical symptoms”*

And:

*This test cannot rule diseases caused bacterial viral pathogens.”*

And the[ FDA admits results \[…\] rule bacterial infection co-infection viruses. agent detected may definite cause disease.”*

So tests currently carried RNA sequences nobody proven cause C-19. Fingers crossed. Maybe they'll figure mess together. Tbh wish leadership would come say they've 100% proven COVID made biolab Wuhan, even true. everybody would common enemy everybody would willing part. think would make issue nonpartisan again.

That would probably cause issues, we'd lot better virus. stupidity selfishness? Got it, thanks. Enjoy conspiracy filled life. self interest Well I, one, enjoy breathing air opposed CO2 I'm, know, human. Also enjoy able talk people without weird muffled shouting. scared stay indoors wear muzzle. Stop trying force nonsense everyone else. We’re screwed, people going end getting virus, it’s time hopefully pull Here’s dose irony ya, America UK ranked 1st 2nd pandemic response level October 2019. 2 months actual pandemic kicked off. Don’t act like psychos wouldn’t throw tantrum tried close Starbucks beach Dude shut fuck up. Fear mongering? Really. Please shut fuck up. 

 state peaked weeks ago nearly bad Arizona right now. working ICU 5 years. stressed uneasy I've ICU while. much labor intensive average ICU patient. Rule outs every ICU admit makes whole process much difficult. Often enough extra hands run bunch shit you. mention staffing issues exposures take staff couple weeks. 

So work ICU shut fuck up. speak nurses currently taking double thier normal patient assignment states right also shut fuck fear mongering. That's I'm saying.

But busy treating people disagree enemy, stop consider understanding situation may wrong.

My mother dependent me. widowed. heart failure brother killed. die, goes nursing home. 

And I'm extremely, extremely high risk. 

So, family complete isolation. getting vaccine poses risk you.

But getting unsafe vaccine poses risk mother.

But busy jerk, know. may harsh, that's many would *feel* makes appropriate. far differentiating, kids could pick up. anyone brings home, parent who, despite precautions take avoid exposure, somehow got anyway. Must asymptomatic young people hospitalized abundance caution got scolded customer wasnt cleaning stamp machine every time someone used it. going going out, assume nothing's cleaned use gloves. people charge cleaning usually overworked cant get everything even wipe surfaces day. interesting! follow-up asymptomatic flu carriers contagious? first hospitals suffer hit capacity deaths start really coming Here's list possible outcomes: worried both. permission tell opinion? keep getting backlash sides? Holy frak. new level stupid. think coronavirus catalyst severe fracturing American ""empire"". 
While completely agree voting absolutely necessary, real concern *can voting truly fix situation*? I'm sure campaign capable fixing deep flaws covid exposed (healthcare system, American spirit, population severe underlying health conditions, hyperpolitical environment, education failure). Getting virus control really tip iceberg getting country back track. I'm sure matters gets play White House puppet (Trump, Biden, anyone else). totally made day. Nobody - date - proven existence SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

Off course RNA? virus.

The fact post articles fram JANUARY shows zero idea fast science works. hundreds articles every week, every day. 'On knees' wud better Yes. Maybe young know adults live, understand that, adults, social life means violating Corona precautions. can't social distance pub, concert, beach, even museum. Sex violates hell demands asking everyone celibate years? 

If fear infection, stay home. I'll even deliver groceries. I'm going fucking pub. Covid 19, leaving country near soon. lol

Nah, know limits. know purposely trying gaslight me. 

So yeah, I'll tell go die since purposely obtuse dick. Tried engaging rationally, insulted me. And? time already Europe, chinese citizens. nationalities could fly china US pleased. useless. comparison, non-seasonal vaccines much, much effective this.

MMR: 97%

A 50% vaccine would better nothing, still pretty shit. I’m super religious anything think g-d trying tell us he’s shit now. I've virus. People argue back forth, Vitamin D3 helped keep inflammation symptoms manageable. Take advice worth. Protestors bringing home work. many weeks ago thousands streets yelling screaming? Fuck shithole nation. already spent planning theatrical release next year. drop $75M blue Disney+ summer might able agree cold. covid, known anyone personally tested positive zero symptoms. work, though? cop even get name? required register someone got airport? Summary:

(masks worn everyone)  Proving human human transmission easy redditors make be. uncrowded sunny beach probably one safest places go to. crowded beach pictures last weekend though, that's something else. Yep agreed. Malta depends lot tourism economy liable virus imported. fact opening flights everywhere july 1st. 😩 measures forced encouraged :/ Dear Boris, frak off. Save America! Wear mask, wash hands, socially distance! 

-The US govt PSA campaign plastered media platforms. think people desensitized.

I think literally paying attention hospitals, victims, anything else. real comes town. That's battle field. wait aunt gets sick try take hospital, they'll get told ""we're ICU"". they'll suddenly grave understanding ignorant callous like.

The question is, happens next. going to, seriously, double again? seem use worst case scenarios base. good bad thing, people prepare worst hope best people also lose faith projections “cry wolf” don’t come true. think referring surgical masks, better job holding stuff keeping stuff out. surgical mask still provides lot protection wearer. way better nothing.

The convention change hospital couple occupied rooms full capacity. Attendees come country, return there. end Jacksonville hospitals. virus work fast. created nice strawman though. current spike much worse one convention could do. Cool thank you. mean 90% stuff says direct Fox News talking points, wrong near surprising dogs food gives shiny coat... *Eyes bottle shampoo dry damaged hair* cousin RN Boston want go bathroom break room - basically anywhere COVID ward - take every single thing body change new everything Unless it’s enforced huge penalties kind pointless. forgot 5), ties 1)

trump said virus big deal. said need reopen. wearing mask directly contradicts trump, basically stating trump wrong. Ah, think mandating law probably important part (hasn't happened state), especially backed level official enforcement, people can't casually flout law realistic concern getting stopped police.

I know much effective would police issue citations, I'm still somewhat skeptical effectiveness trying use social pressure improve mask compliance, least larger towns cities. Though law place least make mask wearing norm, make tactics viable.

I still know think review bombing retail establishments appropriate given limited measures available enforce law policies. _know_ management given shit means, again, job enforce law given risks. Shut state use CDC definition, within 6 feet 15 minutes longer someone symptomatic confirmed positive. 

You're right, battle resources. can't quarantine everyone room positive, especially extreme lack safety net have. That's contact tracers, determine meets definition exposure warrants testing quarantine. I’m overseas visa expires September. God don’t want come back America Well...that's technically correct. people need prez role model? broken fucked up, dear leader level icon worship.

 ideal type head state one job forget them.  Yeah guess. went Vegas August liked 43/110 degree heat, didn’t want long.

But gets 35/95 degrees here, people like hit patios.

Different types heat.

Maybe gotta get UV HVAC systems public places. Wow,neat video!

Also 2nd time state. like eating California restaurant distanced outside felt soon. Wyoming probably little safer.

Lmao bro good laugh thank yeah games expensive imho.. slow :/ June 1st least 1% would 3.4 million, sounds really crazy. crazier might India’s count; India’s population 1.35 billion Consistent, high-probability enforcement low fines drives significant behavior change even ""expected value"" fines same. Therefore, better reasonable fines cops actually give rather huge fines dissuade enforcement. 

Behavior change far 95% chance getting $25 speeding ticket 5% chance getting $500 ticket. speed cameras work (I necessarily support reasons, work) - less - cops sitting side road don't. Sadly simultaneously luckily, prevalence levels still low enough C19 risk deniers STFU grow balls still make extinct month half, exactly like beginning pandemic. bit harder 500,000 unnecesary deaths, 100k Americans, still it. classic illustration dunning Kruger effect. little piece cloth face nothing give false sense security. Wearing one going keep getting sick infecting others. lmao, imagine dumb. would much happy...if mice. Nordics testing less nowadays

The Nordic countries also visiting Sweden. Fingers crossed let guard cause major mess like New Zealand did. ventilator go 🎵

The ventilator go 🎵

The ventilator go dooooowwwwn 🎵

(now got stuck head 😃) missing point, millions kids opportunity get it, seem catch spread well adults. kids able stay home many single parents. 

Kids also less severe symptoms. many studies show transmit well. (It's mixed, granted studies show transmit worse adults). curiosity - original comment say? “And I’m proud American, least know I’m freeeeee”  friend died covid. People insist really die covid. Yes, admit, diabetes, obesity hypertension killed her, covid. looks pretty bad even age 50 though. I’ll go enjoy afternoon parents brother, sitting outside grilling, low risk thank much Oh. see asking.

I talking both. There’s another virus ready get going China now. Can’t imagine we’d handle virus actually kills 5x’s people Covid. Unfortunately family members problem definitely legitimate concerns, sure, sadly fuels fire people already deny vaccines. Corners definitely cut, maybe corners financial corners laziness corners? mention technology constantly advancing, presumably faster rates. since we've type crisis, perhaps, normally, things take longer should? I'm expert, course, maybe food thought.  thats true, candidate going Phase 2/3 July/August. generally good news. candidates increases chance successful vaccine year's end. Younger people getting infection frequently now, inherently lowers death count. I'm sure factors one personally offer I’ll point everything diabetic, type 1&amp;2, needs medically free Ireland (&amp; I’m sure European countries also). It’s chronic disease. Madness think way American citizens treated America ill. people make easy mock though.

I agree plenty non-idiotic small business owners getting decimated though. People losing livelihoods they've spent years building sad, mention impact employees. That’s great way spark civil war. 

You realize heavily armed vocal minority never comply forced vaccines, right? Anti-vaxxers represent anywhere close majority. They're loud. You’ve fucked every single attempt understand what’s going man.

Not per infection numbers page cite, don’t even make sense.

98 hospitalizations per 100,000 total population, bulk aren’t infected isn’t somehow going shrink 4.6 hospitalizations per 100,000 known infected.

Your hospitalized per 100,000 total population always smaller number hospitalized per 100,000 total infected.

Surely see that?

It’s easy thing realize.

Like easy. put bet India, country deny medicine patents. This. 10000% people discussing politics strangers public forum indeed retarded. self aware notice. anybody hear trust Goldman Sachs ? 🤷🏻‍♂️😂 comparison, Canada 100,000 cases throughout *entire* pandemic. 40k deaths later NY control....idiot outside Ontario, majors across entire GTHA-- Greater Toronto Hamilton Area -- agreed require masks worn public private indoor spaces, ""suitably defined"". GTHA 7 million people half province's population.

 mostly put via municipal bylaws (with potential fines although focus education) means city councils need pass them. 

The ""pitch"" public fairly simple, far see, namely (1) covid-19 infection rates may appear low gone away surges spring time, (2) second wave likely coming months fall, quite explicitly (3) seen happened US let's go direction. Hopefully get everyone acclimated masks second wave.  I’m trying wrap head around math.  hope gilead sees bro 

Edit: seems reddit won’t let reply follow-up comment calls posting history question. isn’t second ever comment two years, delete comments I’m hard doxx, bro vaccine inserts warn ""risk death"" &amp; paralysis amongst things ?

what [496,000 children paralysed India Bill Gates polio ? dude still hair. Considering much pulled out.  can't see ahead next quarter. quarter coming due, suddenly worried. many stories Americans dying afford medication? 

Research still profitable elsewhere grants cover it. 

This EVERY DEVELOPED NATION except US socialized healthcare kind.

The ones US system benefits avarice greed gluttony pharmacological insurance companies. almost 3 years Facebook cannot state liberating is. cable tv almost 4 years now, absolutely nothing drivel boob tube. UK lucky johnson got covid, immediatly changed idea, getting going bullshit trump That's literally said phrase immediately prior, dude. Remdesivir vaccine, treatment already contracted virus. lessens symptoms improves recovery time. Huh. mean, studies showing low household transmission rates right maybe got lucky. provide source indicates masks harmful helpful, please? Florida says hold beer. Lmao love idea old retirees Boston New York living Florida going Sunday afternoon game team town putting ever observed wearing mask public tail queue needing medical treatment Wuhan ? Hi! title actually exact [Google Also, speak Danish Swedish (well speak Swedish ok, like Danish speaker never studied does-- imperfectly). Danish ""skal"" means ""must"" quite often google said did, assumed right ""ska"" similar ""skal"" basically word. However, true looked ""ska"" function Swedish. assure error unintentional blame Google + Danish. ;) usually combo good enough get Swedish right. 

Do think either post could restored could given permission resubmit different title? things going time, like reopening restaurants bars, know.

Wait, know that? point, piss off. he’s trying maintain instability country projected figures NEVER panned before.  much would getting rid Trump save? 🤭 Nearly two Vietnam war American casualties worth American lives. sad truly think states (corporations) want take fast, easy, destructive route. cases hospitalizations drastically go up, crash couple months, causing needless death, virus run course. people elderly underlying medical issues, becomes exaggeration fear mongering. never wanted hit many people walking store see people protecting neck fupas getting COVID. trying pedantic 7 states *don't* open container laws. They're rare. little room middle right now, especially social media (including Reddit) extremes. Sensible solutions comments drowned fringes yelling other.


It used pissed right pissed left simultaneously pretty good indicator “right” thing.  times. Cry maga hat, bigot. You’re done find hard believe everyone America know personally, 1 friend someone ventilator even died Covid. right matter someone close gets sick, God forbid dies, make sense me. worst flu season pandemic, something like 70 80k die US. measured entire year. We've 126k confirmed covid deaths, 99% happening less 4 months. Worse. Anti-vaxxers going fuck whole thing us. think one step insidious that. good portion us convinced dying ""keep economy running"" patriotic, noble thing do. need feign regret convince people jump live grenade protect pile money.

In fact, scenario, they're sitting manufacturing huge pile grenades, convincing bunch people queue buy said grenades, asking sacrifice pulling pin throwing grenade next pile money. Pull pin, throw grenade, jump grenade. NEXT! \~\~""We can't hurt money!""\~\~  right here, specially majority Americans read 8th grade level lower publications written ELI5 language. walking work yesterday man driving opposite side street yelled idiot wearing mask walking sidewalk U-turn drive past give babble second time... live Houston ICUs filled capacity moment work restaurant mask mandatory employees else sent home...only America deal stupidity like Doubtful whatever I’m one claims trump greatest. wanna see follow says. want inject lungs disinfectant wanna start hydroxychloroquine said anything Jesus? come spread word evil space tyrant xenu! Says bye troll telling someone hopes die. That’s hilarious haha. 

I’m also sure you’re surprise lmao. Impossible say starts tomorrow. look data TX daycare centers since reopening (it’s good). First, choosing want go population likely exposed. instance location lot infection, sector likely exposed, like health care workers. 

That said, googled mRNA-1273 one links:  us

Depends higly patent. saying true many products patent protected US. highly expect medical drug strong worldwide patent protection. think least 1 person happy friend gotten sushi couple times favorite place, getting takeout probably going way continue even CV19 vanish tomorrow. one genuinely curious Trump manages last long without getting sick? He’s obviously taking whole thing seriously, takes precautions keeps meeting dozens (if more) people every day without distancing. lucky?  change fact lot office workers perfectly work home that's said ""as much possible"". That's fewer people close proximity office fewer people public transport. little things contribute fewer cases, helps keep control.

Look Germany going example. 1/4 population US, far fewer cases deaths per million, restrictions place, proper testing population actually respects rules. individual regions free decide restrictions needed seems work pretty well them. infect volunteers could pluck already infected pool people? immune compromised individual, I'm prepared die clearly superior lifestyle choice.  I’ve listed facts above. want discount them, go ahead neither knows happen months. 

Predictions incredibly mark. smuggling bacon knows going happen I’m getting mainly stay family. negativity constant fighting much me. yay nato more! atypical = typical. double negative.
 
The numbers percentages extrapolated cursory Google search today's cases US. said, know numbers underreported, we've got work that's we've got.
 
I realize Vox quite hatred I'm finding today. Why? 

Isn’t like common place? 

Sure greater numbers would expect doctors nurses use seeing shit like makes sense now... think pushes laws get way much enjoyment laughing idea people panic buying toilet paper pandemic What? assumption correct (that virus comes outside China), fault China failing contain outside virus. think blame China (for reason blame countries hit hard Covid-19). Shirley, suggesting dont want give 10% income mega church. weird anti-tribe mark shame. serious question, kind work filter disallows `http://ir.inovio.com` reddit? Yes, we've known many years. Now, who's going put stop it? people vaccinated measles anti-vaxxer still cause outbreaks there. gotta wait price tag... necessarily care unemployment rate.

I care people.

Are safe? access affordable health care? need?

And weird politicians care first thing nothing second. *should* wear mask place staff *must* wear masks, unless specifically stated - like seated table restaurant assisting deaf person, etc. \*doesn't Yeah right, covid cases definitely increased since protests... This, too, fall deaf ears. comments reacting article confusing two. one (not anyone credible, least) ever suggested infected person’s viral load would impact severity case, responses like “this bad news guess means severity infection crapshoot” confusing two ideas. 

They likely cannot test *hypothesis* without challenge study, would unethical novel virus. know NZ *zero* restrictions internally moment? 

They still locked international borders everything else back normal. ...but would see starting sooner 6-7 weeks. would, put it, ramp up. didnt happen. relatively flat 2-3 weeks protests started skyrocketed. claiming nothing it. also assuming would return 100% growth rates. can't hold true forever, put, far prepared defended catching February. 

Here's guess: places shut another month. 4 weeks, we'll slowly open up. roughly 6-7 week time frame we're addressing now, time, instead using exact logic saying took 6-7 weeks protesters infections ramp up, blame rise cases immediate reopening happen around time, give take week, suddenly forget gymnastics completely absolve protests happened within exact incubation period rather blame everything events happened 6-7 weeks ago. point it’s simply “thank service“ folks. Herd Immunity one step closer. 

I appreciate you’re going there, getting sick, dying behalf. greater sacrifice. However, RIP everyone kill accidentally process. Isn’t UK vaccine tweaking older vaccine? isn’t really “new” vaccine. ""Some allegations"" data. data materials like cardboard hard surfaces, again, food.

And flat admitting wrong. Finally. Thank you. Yay people dying! agree you, definitely influenced made every effort minimize virus. However, still believe could told us truth. started wearing mine jockstrap hearing virus cause testicular damage.

Not today, virus! would NCAA schools make millions backs student athletes? Getting virus accidental injury.

If got flu, hepatitis, west nile, ebola, sickness / disease kill you, died, covered.

For illness covered need general life insurance um. 

fuck.... Miami-Dade County technically required face masks public locations since first day reopened. much way enforcement feel like wearing mask.

I attended training class given county airport trainer took mask give lesson one cared people room took off. course, surprising given airport's total disregard safety employees.

This week they've added fines stuff. durations human trials cut every stage

No, moving phase 3 without even publishing *preliminary* results phases 1 2.

Not requirement vaccine trial. Normally save Even data monkey trials peer reviewed yet.

I've read them. They're published. people actually wearing masks? bars / restaurants open? can't drink eat mask on.  *In theory* contact tracing would lead testing asymptomatic people also. twat. people wondering Gilead stock gone much one reason why. Absurd thinking countries bend current status US. Expect efforts distance US pharmaceutical industry even pandemic over. screwing elderly immunosuppressed. anti-vaxxer. pandemic something set beyond me. However, I'm thinking time may. people push change get corrected. read way like ‘F’

then read comment understood fuck gonna hold heads it’s literally fault 100%. thing would add zero coverage MSM negative aspects month long protests. directly cause lot deaths COVID.

No. Mandates matter. reluctant folks fact default ""following law"" businesses/people actually respond actual monetary threat fines, get improved uptake. Likewise, give businesses worried upsetting customers cover enforce policy they're otherwise reluctant enforce. result 100% mask-wearing, improvement meaningful dealing exponential growth.  Made worse obesity, diabetes, clogged arteries brand it? I’d like buy good masks info unclear. count vaccine. IRL gacha Another Miami resident checking in: also experience places like Target Publix people distancing wearing masks.

The problem bars. People gather hours obviously wear mask they're drinking. viewer hasn’t bad thought would be. Although without atmosphere sounds fans definitely something missing. 

I wonder it’s gonna feel NBA fans usually much closer momentum factor. fair, prisons Brazil overcrowded understaffed. Conditions sh*t visitation one ways keep inmates somewhat “happy”. Health authorities prohibit want. Civil disobedience social unrest increase government clamps down. March April intense NYC. 20k deaths one city.

By token, screw people can't afford rent. There's plenty can.

See logic makes sense? know pandemic first starting, thought process unfortunately along lines ""who cares? grandparents dead except one semi-estranged/i've never close with, parents 60, I've never met anyone virus, life need put hold?""

Dive bars. guys making 250-300 1 Friday night.  Theres reason alot industry like tip policy.

As fitness trainer, cross fit isn’t good. restaurant lifer, this. six foot rule joke. whole thing sham- safe wise people eating shared spaces inside. Period. mention using shared restrooms. 
Of course there’s also added hazard knowing patrons likely denialists think it’s hoax don’t want social distance mask up. mean believe there's bearded guy outer space, impregnating virgins, giving eternal life + grapes believe exploits, throwing rest lakes lava? What's matter you? Thats big problem Trump. weakness certain subjects, listening experts knows doesnt know shit subject xyz. going sound awful elitist trying times like this, opinion see rise private dining clubs. compare experiences, private clubs vastly superior protocols cooperative guests. cost able attend private club matches populous friendly price point, see people exclusively favoring culture professionalism. it’s cheaper. Didn’t realize much spending getting drinks drinks bars/restaurants. get 6 pack price 2 beers out. Maybe 12 pack buy cheap stuff. tho? goddamn hard wear something face make mask mandatory? Hospital administrators business people. Money goal, period. 

There three big types hospitals. Public, private, nonprofit private profit. Maybe administrators last group describe, budget considerations first two nothing profit.  situation different, caught national alarm sounded. go bar June everything know downright irresponsible. know remdesivir already gone trials indications approved. fact fast-tracked negate previous costs incurred.

Edit - additionally, clinical trials hardly cost drug development. Process development, formulation development, analytical development require serious investments time, raw materials, capital equipment, etc. Never wildest dreams would imagine restaurant dining barbershops would hill Americans would die upon.

Get ready trouble...AND MAKE DOUBLE Well disagree ""will mask protect me"" primary question, least important question. question public health response always ""should everyone wearing masks"". yes there's lots nuance effective actually is, details confused issue further, never really downside playing safe saying everyone wear mask (n95 availability withstanding, wearing cloth masks end anyway)  It’s hard care myself.

Faculty : Malik students even countries low case counts still risk. Like we’re trying say, eradication isn’t possible. fliers work around closed boarders. Right could fly Iceland Iceland fly Europe. long run it’s much end game plan. Nobody one, pandemic. They’re unpredictable. Even experts implying we’re gunna live it. Closed boarders economies destroy countries far extensively. think NYtimes video clips hearing. punchline end everyone ranting order 70+ year woman came said husband two children died virus can’t emphasized enough, large amount COVID patients hospitals gonna Medicare inherently carries loss providers. Without elective surgeries we’re gonna see lot hospital bankruptcies 2021/2022.  want live smart society. good alternatives? According article passed pigs humans supposedly human human. deadliness non swedish/eu/north american ethnicities 220%, people swedish/eu/north american ethnicity deadliness corona 1% lower means, corona, fewer swedish people died usually time year. Spoiler aleart.....

There isn't.... Nah, get board everything said. think even citizens care - hopefully there's handful them, might similar opinions diverge - work trying enact change daunting thankless. Lobbyists disadvantage  Women's Day March Madrid good example outdoor manifestation still super spread event (it primary accelerant Spanish epidemic, together people returning Bergamo-Valencia football match). difference back then, early days European outbreak, mitigation measures place yet (no masks, social distancing, disinfecting hands), virus basically free play. 
I'm saying BLM protests source new infections (it's pretty much inevitable), large portion attendees wearing masks, practicing social distancing hand washing probably reduced (effective reproduction number) significantly. means lot talking something spreads exponentially. 
&amp;nbsp; 
Personally, currently I'd rather stay outdoor protest day spend hours inside bar restaurant. That’s right, haven’t. But, started month ago, explain supposed spike cases didn’t occur 2 weeks ago. Bad point bar socialize people drink hand literally *is* fault factory farmers creating conditions viruses like thrive enable a2h transmissions.

In case, *literally* China. They're lying saying masks needed. Either way dishonest point. act magnet respiratory droplets, sieve. Bruh vacation year bullshit, point I've starting want Rona get break lie bed 2 weeks. actually starting sound realll nice. definitely sections cleaned while, like whole store empty. lot canned stuff totally gone never saw ramen store like 3 weeks straight. Edit: replied wrong comment, sorry! right liberty pursuit happiness. changed mind life part. Ya probably big part it. worried lie protect health Frontline doctors nurses again? absolute monsters that. What's next, lie keep children safe next??? appears pollution Shanghai bad Wuhan, may explain fewer masks. According JHU case-fatality rate (CFR) Shanghai .9% Wuhan 6.6%. masks effective, would expect Shanghai would much larger percentage wearers Wuhan. found rigorous studies topic. find post? company makes medical gowns may able help. Yeah concerning, could result positive tests getting reported faster negative tests. I'd wait couple days see stabilizes. whole thing, political , worse USA&lt; people dying bonehead!! sick!!! People dumb treat such. things like mandatory masking, enforcement, social pressure, reopening cases drop, super important. give people opportunity abuse rules will. Property land areas bought discounted prices too. (Auctioned likely) 
With many evictions around corner, prices fall, wealthiest grap fraction privius cost, theyll turn huge profits markets slowly reestablishes. Even loose money now, profits unreal, richest gets huge marketshares compared before. wealthgap end monsterius. Seems like they’re waiting everyone get it... How's HIV vaccine coming along? Exactly maybe everyone busy taking care dont energy worry someone immediate home household. saying right upset, adding perspective. Hopefully, throw paper ground ticketed littering! Jesus fucking christ.... UK got 5,000 day early May. US 5 times population = 25, 000, prediction 100,000 looks really bad.

But factor UK testing 7 weeks ago, US, difficult compare. give shit yourself, understand coming from. give another chance. Everyone right extremely selfish, nobody showing compassion others. speaking blanket terms, think light end tunnel you. Whats great pizza worried covid, 0ut pizza box preheated oven 250 20 minutes kill germs, wash hands eat. box wine likely summon Judas shield. Might best move. far fish, long break pieces good. Yeh, check Arizona's charts:

 trend friend.

And here's Arizona's current ranking among states, terms per capita deaths: Stop stupid Show data links protests huge spike cases I’ll believe it. data exists, best evidence reopening what’s caused spikes cases. Hahaha...I don’t know whether laugh cry comment imma both. get TX town hall meeting go along OC CA West Palm Beach FL? Yea u understand labor cost amount work. Barback spends hours juicing, bartenders prep handmade syrups, even including seasonal menu make 1 original cocktail sort hand made syrup....the amount bartenders u need full capacity, full wine list, dinner menu etc...

So 12 hour isnt reasonable. bosses fault obviously. sucks STILL everything, fresh homemade tonic, citrus, table service etc.........n customers say ""ummmm cant tom Collins Collins glass?""

Ummmmmmmmmmmm that's supply u clean plastic, throw away collins cup masks u still drink nice refreshing tom collins COVID FREE.........

I swear....the responses I've getting ppl bar astonishing. Mask use getting much better (although many wear masks nose out) there's still many people give shit take precautions. Honest question, come global death rate decreasing spread increasing? flat illegal many levels.  admit public too? managers alert staff anyway?

He kiss ass goodbye. teachers staff hardly get mentioned important kinds posts... That's pretty much standard practice highly contagious diseases. course thing matters, probably thing matters most, especially comparing situation areas. 

Having low death count cases soar way better high death count cases soar. Although I'm guessing gonna stay way hospitals now. He's can't run again, he's reached term limit. undoubtedly run Senate seat though. Kansas board! Mask mandate goes effect July 3rd! 🌻🐃 right, intent commit bodily harm? evidence sender intends make statement happen? isn’t threat, disgusting belief evidence support intent make reality. fact, read full article headline, say directly don’t plan make happen, would like see it. still fucking gross. Agreed - dad also thrilled matter Murphy does. I, hand, call Poppa Murph, cause he's gonna turn state around get shit together. 

He's also high risk, literally walked major surgery crisis just....did it. I'm big fan. bullets fly KC regularly. Also place I’ve ever feet away shooting. People drawing conclusions early virus less severe. want least 2-3 weeks pass make judgements. Logic taught well. read article linked, says seeing much higher normal number serious (non-COVID) health problems. think might many people avoided seeing doctor have.

The LAT headline implies Riverside ICUs overflowing COVID patients. I'm pointing case. yet.

FWIW, live Coachella Valley everybody wears mask public places. Nope. Almost side effect horses. remember way back estimated number based cremations 45,000. People waiting line hours pick ashes family members. Tell parents... can't even process absurdity headline. evil piece shit. That's awesome tool! Good find. Thank you. Nunes country would guess. Central Valley 99 goes. it’s worth, think considered allies rather friends, especially best friends. Goku’s best friend always Krillin. don’t suddenly stop taking meds without telling doc? talk therapist? 

Effexor withdrawals serious (they described “brain zaps”) never stop taking psychotropic medication without talking doctor first. SSRI’s (Zoloft. Prozac, lexapro) less severe withdrawal symptoms. concept (SMH) opening difficult. Oregon pretty much wanted whenever throughout soon “started” lifting restrictions looked like month Thanksgiving Christmas. familiar area it’s mostly rural.

/ Never actually that, thankfully. point, AZ pretty damn close, ain't much different South. That's nice, truly Canadian ? Oh absolutely, Japan's response could've much better, numbers look real bad compared South Korea Taiwan. Abe slow act unwilling test really seems like mask-wearing culture saved Japan becoming another Italy. good evidence effectiveness masks, debate late game are... uncle Sam wearing one he's unique gets frequent testing. potentially safe, “cheap” highly effective therapy infected population. also used prophylactic, effect probably won’t last much. can’t scaled much synthetic drugs could great “bridge” alternatives available. health systems strained immunity already low, second pandemic may straw breaks camel. live Phoenix handful friends nurses doctors various hospitals across valley, similar responses ask going individual hospitals. ""We capacity control."" Still fontucky. mentally exhausted. headed disaster wish could get out. probably even went high school together. Mississippi here....our governor needs shut bars salons make restaurants take out. 

He afraid unemployment claims.

We screwed. need, smartphone trumps chip implantation assume death rate somewhere .1-.3% actual number cases something like 60 million. Yeah think we’re way past stopping it. Imagine Facebook 2020 end shelter place anything control, huge percentage population opposing masks. thing America never great working together unless tragedy strikes. look NY NJ one wanted wear mask almost everyone is. Let states start high amount deaths actually lose someone know. quickly change mindset. Exactly. Grew beach town well still live here. know better go store weekend. 

When toilet paper started running Philly/North Jersey stores earlier year, people took trip ""down shore"" clear stores well. 

They fucking invade towns like roaches. side main stream media deceptive. Rest bias. blame, world one even two sided. simple stop thinking is. Agreed. balls shut Rodeo. RODEO. think move kept things much worse. 

Sadly know someone went chili cook shut down, later died COVID-19. Good!  watched piece Hong Kong they've controlled well. obvious prepared SARS obvious deep collective empathy one another concern others well being. piece contrasted Americans lack consideration others. country friends. world views us... 517 sq mi. one biggest cities terms land.

Ahh, free beer appy hour many times massively flawed study going posted here? T-cell immunity important peer reviewed study. saw lot masks getting groceries today. two people wearing improperly.

I go restaurants. can't eat drink mask. assume that's easy place catch it. seems lot schools... ours, thing. Aside lying effectiveness, SECOND biggest mistake trying say masks protect wearer instead protect people. Americans we're talking about, here. thought good way sell mask wearing??? Hell, I'm witness I'll recruit folks get chant going.  One would think CDC would top it. surprised gagged. fail whale around. Govt failed. Citizens failed. Right now, you’re NZ citizen. using Wuhan data least beginning, they? can't speak California, say certainty live around Ontario Airport stopped trying reopened. drive local downtown fairly regularly one wearing masks hanging restaurants. Surely that’s reportable virus spread... 

By people... 

In enclosed spaces... 

With poor ventilation... 

Talking.

The Japanese said back fucking February. Oh good idea. buried political nonsense cultural freedoms. I'm surprised, update almost week ago Good fa then. Hey Russian troll trying maximize hatred discontent minimal effort, pretty efficient move. Whoever thought one probably got extra ration vodka potato month. Chinese propaganda January: wear masks, quarantine, virus bad. Buys  world's PPE supplies save Chinese people.

Western regime propaganda two months: masks work, go vacations,  FLU! herd immunity BS inject disinfectant ChYNA  BAD! flails badly acquiring PPE.

China January: beats arrest people break quarantine wear masks.

White people regimes February: beats Asians wearing masks.

Listen one, actually live. Listen other, might die. obvious one credible people trust government more. 😋 went local Planet Fitness hours ago. Let’s hope best lol Data Atlantic covid19 project shows total number daily new hospitalization (not percentage) barely changed since March. seeing resources becoming scarce? absolutely correct thing do, really terrible performers. Unlike many industries Broadway Broadway bounce back. We're already seen... six?... shows close permanently, stop there. heart goes performers crews families. Advice. test lab Wuhan. Yeah post randomized controlled studies shown statistical significance vs placebo. There’s 2: dexamethasone remdesivir Giggity mean, faux news here. whats tokyo have? truth? boots? put straps shoes? I'm lost... Yep, triaged 93 year old memaw tested positive Covid19 Bayesian pneumonia hospital today, wasn’t showing enough symptoms- FUCKING KIDDING ME? Fuck Ducey Or, know, make requirement wear mask public. Wasn’t governor saying worry yesterday, maybe day yesterday? thought field hospitals staffed doctors nurses outside region? don’t want read require killing horses? think ol Mother Nature fed us screwing animals. Exactly. may scary others Chinese people would scared lock-down happen. Massive lock-down, testing quarantine actually make people epicenter feel better. Abbott going pick bars picks churches Man - I’m MD - think pull back non-essential mothereffin restaurants good job shutting down. reopening freaking disaster shit show. follow CDC guidelines rushed idiots TX FL AZ, etc., decided wanted corona.

Now Governor American Psycho waffles. plan reclose like u see possibility coming something, Mr. Bateman? It’s me! New Orleans :) people b dumb fuck, tourists really take cake. respect. I've heard arguments made entirety British Irish Isles become considered things unto themselves. Maybe start GoFundMe give every front line service worker flamethrower visibly wield politely request customers respect mask policy. remote Antarctica, group American research scientists disturbed base camp helicopter shooting sled dog. Don’t stupid: course compare flu. allowed compare things exactly equal now? Anyway, deadly virus flu current treatment options. flu, society take almost zero precautions covid done did. killers; one kills right now. start sliding death rate downward covid, points would start taking less seriously? point would treat like treat flu (a virus kills hundreds thousands year itself, slowly manageably)? Wherever point is, exists, least happily heading direction instead wrong way Yeah dude mainstream totally trusted exactly told fiends crazy saying ""as soon gym open I'm going"". thank you. Ill run outside. customer complains got water cup tiny dust particle side cup continue share plates, sneeze, cough, talk, laugh hug people masks, protection, completely acting like covid even exist yet want make sure they're immune lawsuits. saying catch corona, cheaper buy round trip tickets India spend dime American healthcare. ... realize unstable South American countries are, right ? Although agree European countries better overall systems US believe South America over-exaggeration. 

Living Nicaragua, example, may bring healthcare benefits stability nonexistent. Right? wrote letter Governor Abbott telling patriotic mask messaging solution political problem needing require everyone wear masks. 

Fucking coward though. 

Do remember patriotism bomb blasted 9/11? say anything bad Bush PATRIOT Act, war-on-terror, without told needed get fuck America move another country. 

By far patriotic symbol right b wearing masks public. people freaking football players kneeling anthem, ""unamerican"" ""disrespectful."" respect right inhale nasty ass respiratory droplets? Ugh! Fillakit gotten paid almost 2m believe shit actually worse, Chase concert 1,000 Chris 2,800 attendance packed together. numbers... ugghh many times must this?

Deaths per million citizens.

UK, France, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Belgium... higher deaths per million citizens. You’re literally giving credit fewer people otherwise. 

Many nations close numbers including Brazil earlier outbreak. 

Ok, turn. Maybe basic math something missed education. Ya, suddenly believing virus became political stance. I’m pregnant due 5 weeks. situation, going try good mom ;) 

I totally agree you, though. 'Children barely spread virus extremely unlikely even develop symptoms'

Schools netherlands open 2 months without social distancing, zero spikes.

High schools completely open fall without social distancing sourcing information from?  Testing causes hospital usage, right? cases going up. makes sense. Fauci voice sanity reason. Unfortunately country drowned out. say window opportunity narrowing. think point, closed. part quoted article. Dude medical examiner explicitly says he's seen autopsies.

I'm doubting asymptomatic patients damage, I'm confused medical examiner person discovering that. Dunno got downvoted... 

“From April 12, 2009 April 10, 2010, CDC estimated 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) United States due (H1N1)pdm09 r0 estimated 1.4 1.6, treatments vaccines it. Without mitigation, covid believed r0 5.7.

Edit: that’s latest swine flu outbreak. article states 4.4% general population already exposed g4 strain evidence human human transmission. isn’t something worry point

Edit again: 2019-2020 flu season killed, most, 62k 56m infections. previous h1n1 strain 20% deadly. Hmmm. . . Good question does. Almost daily press briefings. chuckle every time. Lmao fuck i'm monkey's uncle know, maybe actually *is* time start going vegetarian en masse.

Like, love meat much next guy, know shot across bow Mother Nature see it. What’d Chris Janson do? USA healthcare disgrace. Everyone involved ashamed complicit scam. ask much taxable income is? talking tens thousands Australia youd talking million dollar plus per year income lost cause mate. know meaning “possible” is?

Please refrain replying, you’re going embarrass yourself. Good luck scraping life gullible idiot. virus 'pandemic potential' found China used proud country since voted Trump we're joke. live NY. Define “massive downpayment house”. SGE 400 series generally well-regarded budget pick. Avon Protection C50s, good premium choice (and ones see cops well-funded departments wearing). There's Scott uses NATO carts too, people like it. Avon FM53/54 ultra-premium choice probably overkill. carts, got MSA P100 carts Amazon pretty cheap, plenty places get lots companies make - that's beauty 40mm standard threaded connectors. got C50s Botach. available eBay. Canadian Preppers ApprovedGasMasks, among sites, SGEs, experience them. China, it’s tradition PLA soldiers go front line major disasters, earthquakes,floods etc. 

In new outbreak, military personnel deployed control order market, exposed group besides doctors (the CDC confirmed April 20 vaccinate doctors special circumstances, need implement outbreak better controlled)

most Chinese residents feel safer PLA soldiers dispatched local area. United States missing key message. Median 12 days test (which usually post-symptoms) death. Everyone thinks number much higher actually is. course, means half take longer, average much higher median. statistic sometimes quotes average, means nothing. Fuck. Hope suppressed. month. Could know virus , better treatment, see estimated severity virus? Yes. I've practicing week!! said second wave, mind. Riding coronavirus like cowboy...yeeha! virus. death rate definitely much lower. remember 2 months ago, Rachel Maddow screaming everyday 2000 people dying US everyday covid 300. Possibly strain circulating less lethal. feel that, parents call names every day, least he’s best thing Yes, CDC said nursing home patients returned immediately. extra space hospitals nursing home patients need hospitalization hang two weeks. could also argue Northeast wiped simply getting hit super hard... It’s black white world there. nuances left. You’re either us fight virus, you’re them. always baffled people already Oh agree that. doubt peer reviewed research efficacy yet mostly substantial anecdotal evidence I’m skeptical putting much hope treatment yet. Face mask ventilator ? I’m 35, married, husband home. 

Though spent shit ton time parents’ house decade ago ;) link airport outbreak? Everybody going everywhere. COVID also everywhere. That’s got first place, people flying. Ahhh see /s Every action person takes either increases decreases spread virus.

While agree stuff saying. really like this, think wise saying. everyone took accountability actions shit storm USA. really sorry let down. show 'em Mr. Mayor! world :( Yeah, reads like Italy again. hospitals, would even assess patients certain age certain comorbidities, let alone treat them. However, ethics boards create guidelines. guidelines ultimately applied falls back individual doctors nurses. That‘s horrible situation everyone involved. $100 per person food? Like normal routine?

That's insane NM monitor bordering states (though I'm sure closely thoroughly) brought last week likely AZ maybe TX patients end here. New Mexico. among lowest per capita hospital beds country normal circumstances. stupid complain about. Movies wonderful I'm sad wonder woman delayed long.  long protesting, get trouble think pharmaceutical industry operates loss? sooner people realise care money life better .. naive people unfortunately happens elect people tell government can't fix problems. break make point. I’m entertain whole economy built endless excessive consumption exposed pandemic. lot people realizing need shop eat spend much used to. know hopeless wishful thinking would great people adjusted less wasteful lifestyle emerged pandemic sustainable society. (I know, America's behavior already shown we're incapable cutting back making sacrifices, nice?)

I know it'd shitty consumer &amp; service industries collapse millions put work, point face reckoning unsustainability economy. honestly pandemic seems good chance we're going get change ways en masse whole planet burns down...

But yeah...not gonna happen. Exactly, arrest put quarantine two weeks.

We've asked nicely months, done make things worse. Start treating terroristic threats. 6 developed countries newly confirmed COVID-19 cases past 2 days :

🇺🇸 United States : +85,274 new cases

🇬🇧 United Kingdom : +1,715 new cases

🇮🇱 Israel : +1,020 new cases

🇨🇦 Canada : +886 new cases

🇫🇷 France : +802 new cases

🇵🇹 Portugal : +723 new cases

Source : alarming US sole developed country idea reduce transmissions. really gambling want inconvenienced. Staying home actually something routine inconvenience living denial never going happen . thing people wearing masks correctly expecting perform magic levels protection &amp; even though might reduce risk breathing germs someone elses cough that's fitted firmly gaps around edges &amp; nose &amp; breathing material &amp; cracks side. Oh touching face 20 times hour adjust mask &amp; actually shower &amp; change clothes get home.  Otherwise delaying things. Hhhmmm... Yeah... thinking along lines of: let kids eat safely? Lunch one times they're allowed socialize... eating requires take masks CANT NICE THINGS. (I’m NJ resident) ... people like tend think United States country world .. It’s genius plan people wear mask couple months keep themselves, it’s really simple live country horrible health care system, lots stupid people make everything politically motivated, president went way make sure unprepared possible... dismantling teams created handle this, giving away stores PPE, turning game misinforming people encouraging go advice doctors.. actively sending feds try “confiscate” PPE order hand businesses.... country even comes close numbers, even Brazil... They're definitely hiding numbers, curve also definitely looks like EU/Canada's USA's. can't hide this, extent USA's. China stringent lock-downs, shape ones curve seems pretty much determined soon well locked down, long did.

China's worse reported I'm sure, overall they've still done well. Shortening hospital stay one day would pay entire course treatment. CDC said covid positive nursing home residents stay understaffed well equipped deal virus Nursing homes ? Lowest death total Monday since March. think last weekend long march mortality curve, though. Starting see little bit uptick cases older folks South (esp Florida), unfortunately turn least increased deaths week.

Still, worldwide mortality rates turned bit up, nowhere near fast case totals. Definitely declining CFR everywhere (and probably IFR, although can't say sure).  one explained masks way: naked one pees leg wet. you’re wearing jeans naked pee you’re little wet jeans get it. wearing jean pee get wet, jeans might good chance leg dry. How??? 

I've vivid WILD dreams. 

And last three days night terrors. anything COVID, damn I'm waking drenched sweat exhausted indoors transmits virus easier.

This seem explain things though: people 

A. staying home
B. going work (if still it)
C. going shopping (if shops still open)

It's like NorthCal open-air shops, offices bars.. refuted zero multiple issues pointed article. Spamming opinion piece neither understand defend argument.

Yesterday lied said New York highest mortality rate state. Today lying new cases spiking. can't wait see decide make tomorrow. charge lower tuition. doesn’t make sense charge experience nowhere close would get campus. on-campus experience least 75% value people get college. actual material doesn’t matter much end forgetting anyway go workforce. F that. Provide evidence conspiracy. I’m part problem I’m loon ? Here's one add list above: anybody questions NY's handling outbreak anything poster child narrative media has, oddly, decided go with. Yes, Florida Texas populous, Texas' case, confirmed cases weeks NYC seemed manage pretty well far fraction death toll. think going change now? 

Texas also added benefit warm climate state's populations centers year round third youngest population US less population density. much so. How? don’t fu@&amp;ing clue. traffic deal Friday weekends live, 20 miles beach shows is. amazingly good 75% traffic state tags it. Way go, Bridge tunnel crowd. Yeah. physician worked tail end NYC crisis. don’t know us round 2 anything like first time. None colleagues (or I) able talk happened. know personally long time, ever, really deal it. heart breaking see south going “it’s right” wear mask “we nyc, it’ll never happen here. prepared “. thought prepared ny too. Spoiler: not. thought electing Trump made pretty clear. one point Cali well Canada (similar populations). divergence past weeks say least thought non mask wearers Rebels choose wear mask, say paranoid. paranoid dont wear mask. paranoid about? South Park Simpsons Jaded say fuck vote Pennsylvanian, yea

Like 10 nursing coworkers south jersey last weekend. get that, view differently. young daughter thought never asked born. made decision her. result, obligation whatsoever. wants live mom older gets feet, door always open. But, I’m old, everything power make sure doesn’t care me. mother wanted share love another person. thought burden would break heart.  Reuters reports patients commercial insurance U.S., Gilead said would charge $520 per vial $3,120 per course. cost 33 percent increase initial price mentioned governments developed countries, patients government healthcare programs U.S. Gilead initially said would charge $390 per vial.

Gilead also collaborated generic drugmakers based Pakistan India. Hetero Labs Ltd Cipla Ltd agreed supply remdesivir 127 developing countries.

Cipla pricing generic version drug 5,000 Indian rupees, approximately $66.24, Hetero Lab charging estimated $71.54 generic drug.  want personally pull electron microscope start examining? think pushing 6 efforts cure covid something eradicate covid?

The 5G must frying brain lol different way immunocompromised people distance already? deliver food (and spend money develop better food delivery services), deliver medicine etc, there’s still problems like people risk able go hospitals stuff, would lot less problem closing entire economy half uear think government censor you?

The US even tap German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone vet civilians value.

So prism come from?

The nine Internet companies working U.S. government agencies Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, America Online, Skype, YouTube, Apple. nine companies fully aware this.

They sell even Americans, let alone people countries.

Western governments want know, still believe gone?

naive Everyone replying must really short memory. News sources place this. cursory google search, pop up: let's forget had, one point, stated masks necessary. Corporations legally obligated seek profits. Frankly plan along. Protecting American Citizens always way expensive. plan always convince people nothing done, let champion cause you, way cheap mass graves. Americans didn’t challenge, didn’t even blink, bought whole thing begged more. Quite possibly dumbest human beings planet. Looking forward 4+ years Donald Trump well. oh ok, still pushing that? Still would rather live places (but especially Canada Ireland), asked. 

This country's broken. quite time. far great, certainly long, *long* way ""the greatest country world"" like say. surge capacity. means beds floors available ICU uses. Like Tucson Houston, staffing issue. convenience store today Riv. County. 23 girl employee mask, fellow co worker also mask. told local casino night little money, Again, wear mask. Anyone Chicago here? employees customers restaurants longer required wear masks? went place neighbourhood tonight get fries employees weren’t wearing masks walked out. looked window Subway way home weren’t wearing masks either thought maybe it’s required anymore find doubtful? maybe right question would they? belong small, locally-owned gym I've going back since reopned couple weeks ago. Everyone wears mask inside never like three people gym I'm there. sanitize equipment hard. feel pretty safe going there. cannot even begin compare flu.  Well, maybe, least react it, unlike us, sitting watching corona virus curve shooting sky beaches fine everyone goes nasty shitter. Protestors getting shitfaced gorging themselves, problem. work...just ask VA. Mask mandated last month ignore it. Pass damn laws!! This. next shutdowns coming much quicker first thought. assumed would closer September, are. Based research coming Europe daycare centers US, children schools significant cause virus sure anecdotal cases 

But could easily anecdotal cases child abuse starving schools stay closed ""If find keys, drive here."" Home testing wasnt approved time FDA really is. first moved here, like, wtf shit. tried one. like, yeah, it’s ketchup, weird gross. finished bag. looked another bag. 

Ketchup Doritos pretty great, too. protesters real “knuckleheads”  know either....It pretty much business usual 2009-10. shutdowns, border closures, social distancing, school closures, nothing lot states beginning ignoring 4 months. NY, CT...so many states got hit bad first tackled head on. Now, states ignored going go states much, much worse. didn’t happen? haven’t able go bar restaurant months unless I’ve away trip. I’m immune! Drove Point Plesant Saturday morning 9 10 people walking near boardwalk wearing masks, social distancing. horrifying depressing. need better. want again. Long overdue. state mandates one county, Oregon’s case 7, all. Very, very, well put!! way forward vote. Fuck that. Chicken heads lunch No, think peer-reviewed seen torn apart yet week something? also drastic amount. Steroids would typically given many insane immune/inflammation cascades bad cases many things surprising given viral load dropped it'd good. think SARS/MERS data may thrown world off-course one, tragic. Let's keep fingers crossed? I'm hoping it'll cut death curve out, all.  think many months come unfortunately. talking about? dutch people different species? sound petty whiney white dude attitude. Yeah, I'm dying. main actress supports CCP tyranny. big me. thank you. FDA shut private citizen paying testing supplies/tests? mean ""no one appears immunity it.""

Let's say 5 million recovered people around world. random 50 odd ""relapsed"" people. overwhelming majority relapsed. anything, data suggests immunity least time. someone living Socal sucks read. countries even come close infection burden. even close. Actually 975,000 people US died 4 months. Maybe mean COVID? really great example lack education critical thinking country small minded fuckhead. logic jump conclusions definitive proof US going steeply backwards never advance society.

I want go hospital, look patient dying virus eye, say “you’re really sick, hospital wants money”. realise 5% people end ICU survive? would put people ventilator weren’t going die dense cunt? Italy, Spain UK, countries free healthcare? roughly percentage people infected admitted hospital put ICU. hey, guess they’re faking make US look bad, right? 

You continue denial don’t even know I’m bothering somebody pathetically small minded yourself, please go back school something learn world works. Stop listening garbage see Fox president they’re scientists. True. 

There - total agreement! here. ordered Governor nothing legal therefore unenforceable. blame CDC then..? ""this can't nice things.""

because incompetent politicians keep finding people blame? Small class sizes 10 hygiene measures good enough reopen schools. crazy allowing mass gathering church, bars restaurants keeping schools closed. Frankly 65+ crowd needs stay home meet grandchildren while. School important kids meeting grandparents.
And parents school going kids high risk, need keep kids home. Except people don’t give cancer sneezing coughing people. evangelical? Maybe thinks he's everyone favor plan Great response. Good say Death rate covid-19 may lower increased hospitalizations mean people illnesses could pushed hospital. could lead death. sarcastic hahaha, put s/ doctor country, tell money great deal influence frequency office visits. Sad, true. Apples oranges  knuckleheads gonna get people sick. meanie-bo-beanies gonna get Grandma killed. naughty little scoundrels gonna get someone grasping air hospital week die alone. They're rude That’s partially true. ED, yes apply guidelines ourselves. comes rationing vents, medications, resources unit, patients least stabilized already, make decision. give information ethics committee make difficult choices. Ah guess realized base gonna die first Way go Oregon! 

This best news I’ve seen day. 50 states jump train, wearing masks proven reduce spread virus 70%. 

We get back somewhat normal lives (with masks on). still beats staying stuck home anti-maskers! (I’m stay home orders Houston, again.)

I admit, I’m jealous know Texas one of, last state follow you. Testing
 major donor Washington states flu study (which blew whistle king county's first cases) trying get home test kits covid testing except FDA shut Interesting thanks, guess different system. Aus 100k 2k tax medicare girl pinks ass though Don’t always gamble lives health though? Fuck me, definitely puts many things perspective. large number impossible even wrap head around 70 people per hour passing cancer, every hour, every year. Jesus. look flip side going horrific plane crash everyday positive. Sometimes numbers get big starts feel like number actual human life friends family passing. RemindMe! 20 days pat back hard. seeing expected spikes positive COVID tests, whether asymptomatic young population people social distancing, confounding factor - could extensive use masks mention.

If seeing masks worn protests would also seen many protests protesters wearing masks. transmission outside greatly abated. Reopening indoor spaces air circulation, line regulations, would result higher rate transmission. 

I expecting see rise certain states protests happen, although nationwide, one states heavy protesting seen spike (California). Minnesota, New York, Washington State steady. states biggest spikes fewer protests, including Texas Florida. pedantic it’s virus, germs. Also, it’s true gaps mask, washing hands etc factor safe wearing mask, competence always assumed discussing effectiveness safety equipment. way analogy, can’t go poking holes condom act shocked pregnancy ensues. People either learn use safety equipment properly wash hands, get sick possibly die (or kill Nanna thanks ill timed visit). That’s individual doesn’t speak effectiveness proper mask use.  /r/conservative loves Kanye Trump worship rant slavery choice. They're kinda celebrity obsessed. Brazil exists. Americans always think they're special. Oh wow, quarter year late! Good job Arizona!! Yes. education system exists kids fun

Hmmm...to one person's life vastly much important social development academic achievement precious offspring.  Mine matter.

Failing wear mask careless everyone. suck society gives without giving back anything. culture individualist look like. Again. Everything anything done coronavirus absolutely meaningless comparison. Coronavirus catastrophe scale unlike anything US confronted very, long time. Potentially way back 1946. man telling Fox News gave mask policy would end forced wear showers home. absolutely ridiculous attempt plant seed fear government overreach people. He’s changed mind Bc sees ship sinking. People buying N95s surgical masks like crazy, understand wanting tell people wear masks, honest it.

They open agenda time. People willing mistakes willing forgive do. means stay lockdown next 5 years. bars movies activities open NY too. Prepare protests. Already saw Trump protestors Redlands past weekend demanding masks mandatory. hell break loose tries re-implement lockdown. LOL, don’t know anything life done preparation this. far perfect good position due savings, nothing job station life (neither person would describe “perfect”). It’s great evidence effective treatment Covid doesn’t exist. I've working performing arts venue (i.e., Broadway type stuff), job likely 2021 unless find new employment. I'm good situation otherwise.

It dangerously hot outside right now. don’t mean it’s uncomfortable, mean it’s *dangerous*. fairly common news give heat warnings explain warning signs heat exhaustion heat stroke. 

Just like colder places stay inside winter, warmer places stay inside summer. wonder many go car get mask, many go car drive home get mask, many go car drive different store. So... swine flu 2.0?

I'm hoping vaccine would available february, that's one year covid started. 

Don't online learning aince concerned falling behind. Instead school february extend school next summer. missing 2 months school way. Schools frankly go slow anyway, pick speed bit compensate lost time. Yeah get consult quote usually. plans donate almost entire fortune.

yet done since started charity achieve doubling dollar value .. simultaneously preventing 'rona.

all see talk lot. could solved world hunger day 1 charity many times over, instead wisely investing acquiring inside information things spread fast around world. warned saw Windows spread like virus 90s. Lmao, good luck arresting thousands morons Inland Empire alone refuse wear masks. people continue try dismiss threat? Honest question, what’s going take finally take seriously instead 🤷‍♂️ they’ve got people? 

Per capita analysis extremely important part understanding statistics. doesn’t mean people don’t care, need per capita analysis see really going on. pot plant would done better Trump. actively worked solution first declaring hoax aversion masks.

Obviously talking multi layer ones, home made patches cloth. open bars outdoor seating upset people disregard social distancing wearing masks imbibing. put giant plastic bubbles? I'd actually watch that. article say that. live permanently beijing. day issued lockdown order, happened business Shenzhen. Shenzhen every single district visit work going meals ended calling me. used GPS phone triangulate position times, police district call verify travel schedule itinerary. team guys came hotel throat swab test me; got results back next day. told visited Shenzhen one day later would required quarantine hotel 14 days expense.

After returned Beijing, police called numerous times verify travel schedule places visited Shenzhen. 

This China every single person traveling locked-down city. slang North Jersey NY residents, Understated ""inland hotter"", like Death Valley. Sea World get muggy hell SD Zoo pretty hot visited Phoenix. Time hit tanning salon get reaaal orange Uhm.. thinking Canada, New Zealand, Australia..(though best examples asian countries...) specifically deaths.. I'm much afraid long term side effects..Death going become less less likely time top worry.. (and probably different standards close.. look population more..)

You pretty big attitude problem.. learn talk without constantly insulting people. **Its you. Totally agree highly doubt America ever away current healthcare system. clear years broken work yet nothing ever gets done about. better chance pigs learning fly America realising healthcare system needs massive reform Yeah, biggest clusters NJ farm workers southern part state :(. Donald Trump real virus start. warned January COVID coming nothing. real president would begun moving supplies around strategically behind scenes coordinating allies already developed tests manufacture enough everyone here. virus finally hit, real leader would communicated seriousness public explained necessity measures like contact tracing, lockdowns, masking.

Even George W. Bush, second worst president (maybe 3rd/4th Jackson/Reagan digress) would done that. know true risk - one does. studies. original Sars studies long term illness - great. long shot.

So one say one way risk - risk.   I’m gonna say it; I’m proud fellow Americans right now. point yeah they're screwed. 

But like NY go shit April. Every state country idea would happen hid head sand. governors populations still decided ignore that. 


And they're situation. guys shoes?!  Don’t know he’s software guy, hardware guy? church honey, NEXT! Naperville resident here; fucking morons en masse eating drinking partying like it’s normal. think Edgar Allen Poe’s “Masque Red Death”.


“And acknowledged presence Red Death. come like thief night. one one dropped revellers blood-bedewed halls revel, died despairing posture fall. life ebony clock went last gay. flames tripods expired. Darkness Decay Red Death held illimitable dominion all.” lotta zeroaires Texan lives bar owner livelihoods He’s done best. Trying get ‘muricans comply health recommendations impossible. citizens still follow mask distancing rules. experience US not. flaunt basic guidelines want told do. Stupid people go home true patriot country. like Mulan. Authenticity. not, another universe one. favourite ""shithole country"" blame. Good job, America.  Quite oppostite. Talking China lying. Bad bot  need start teaching. period. never really knew stupid people mask shit came about.

I mean seriously, self esteem fucking high shit this. I'm basically genius. end ,I watched "" silly doomer "" memes  posted daily multiple times eventually drying lol .

I dad get angry first started posting he's come full circle though . takes mask everywhere , social-distancing . happy go fathers day picnic open-air picked favorite food .



So i'll take win . real, work restaurant Shell Beach I’ve waiting groups la sf areas. Really really looking forward weekend.. feel like slo county isn’t anything combat pandemic, it’s really disappointing tbh. Honestly conservative governments (Alberta Ontario mostly) also board taking covid19 seriously, bodes well provinces. Alberta's response nothing like Texas Arizona Especially many months warning?  places weren’t hit hard initially went expecting never would. thing doesn’t work way. Florida opened ours, governor literally mocked experts saying experts said Florida would turn another New York waited. basically said people would behave even encourage force to.

Well, Florida another New York. bars closed again. governor less idiot though. blamed Hispanic migrant workers, agriculture commissioner pointed weeks. he's blaming young people. way stupid reopening mandates. common sense. NY Times article interview:


A top official Centers Disease Control Prevention warned Monday surge coronavirus cases many states “very discouraging” would hard bring control.

“I think lot wishful thinking around country that, ‘Hey, summer, everything going fine, we’re this,” Dr. Anne Schuchat said livestreamed interview. “And even beginning this.”

Dr. Schuchat, principal deputy director C.D.C., kept low public profile pandemic deeply involved agency’s response. Monday, painted unsettling picture Dr. Howard Bauchner, editor chief Journal American Medical Association.

“There lot worrisome factors last week so,” Dr. Schuchat said.

While new cases younger people, said, may spread virus older people others medical conditions face higher risk death.

“So really beginning, hope take seriously slow transmission,” Dr. Schuchat said. “But think discouraging clearly point there’s little virus spread it’s going easy snuff out.”

Her comments came long Kayleigh McEnany, White House press secretary, played spike cases, saying, “We’re aware embers need put out.”

Dr. Schuchat also dismissed idea, promoted earlier year President Trump among others, heat summer might slow infection rate. “In terms weather season helping us, don’t think count that,” said.
Dr. Schuchat said enough data yet answer many questions, including much protection antibodies provide.

“This one easy,” said. “I think need continue learn continue apply we’re learning humble assumptions.” ok, thing. Alex Jones far worse MSM. Actually time gone 27 days b/c we're catching people earlier process. yet America meant richest country planet can't even provide affordable healthcare citizens free covid tests global pandemic. Yes, different way. know virus control companies less likely pick leave. care lives care money. Trump administration same. think reopen everything US recover faster. They're dead wrong, is. Yeah. easy sacrifice entire livelihood put entire saving into. I've never seen less empathy people see reddit. People losing everything relish point really couldn't.  Read coming az doctors converting pediatric wings covid wings double beds isos many hospitals giving code purples full code ie emergency full 5 plus people waiting. also flat enough vents. lockdown left place would different story. Probably let burn Yay! We’re #1 something! blame hospital, entire set billing practices based they're forced* work negotiate insurance companies. charge based chargemaster price, substantially different fictitious price concocted sole purpose appropriately paid insurance companies, based insurance companies work.

In cases like patient loses due practice, necessarily fair blame hospital, either. charged ridiculous rate everyone agreed ridiculous, otherwise would fairly compensated. insurance company acting behalf patient bad job negotiating, apparently also provides garbage insurance leaving patient bill.

Note(*): Obviously, they're forced, except sense effectively viable alternative option patients insured using insurance, due variety factors. Stonks go 🌈 🐻 🌈 
SPY $420.69 July 35 51 deaths, wait 2 weeks spoke cousin... got scared ten case district (of 1 mil ppl)... west ppl like it’s nothing Japanese, fairly common knowledge medical communities. Well except talking. hard say whether anything even now, definitely learned singing activity involves high velocity airflow mouth makes contagious. cans fart spray? ""Wouldn't smell mask"". Oh interested debating? personally name calling me? Got 👌🏻 lol  you’re responding me, I’m sure you’re reacting entire point thread people obligation wear masks times social situations, excuses. protects others protects you. Wonder quarter population sick, time guard hospital ships even enough. quarter population little 75000000

We're even one percent population virus right now. People forced go work risk catching virus theyre kicked unemployment. youre hearing blowing smoke ass one richest people world. person benefited greatly looting plundering country made reasonable response virus impossible, who’s existence implies resources needed reasonable response virus held hands small number people never give up. week NYC, eviction courts opened, 50k cases lined kick people families homes. Meanwhile, since start pandemic, wealth people like Bill increased double digit percentages. He’s literally profiting youre praising him. FDA recommend use KN95s early pandemic; literally guidance hospital staff use Korean N95 FFP2/3 designated respirators. 

They changed this, market flooded dogshit products failed testing, FDA CDC playing whack-a-mole fraudulent products.

There's low risk company buys overpriced shitty mask work. There's high risk hospital that.

Also, nursing homes clear less six figure profit margin per year. normally wear PPE practice infection control (generally systemic problem w practice procurement problem). well prepared receive guidance needed. guy ever actually anything state obvious?  one going that. hear yourself? Washingtonian here. I'm honestly curious when/if inslee shut us again. work powering ahead like going close feel like inevitable come September/October latest. I've got zero faith America ever change healthcare system better. Murica! stated time time herd immunity strategy. ones claim persons making decisions ones citing those, including you. Lmao sound like child hear you. I'm Tennessee exploding here. Everyone running around like normal times. understand it. governor like 'hey let's extend school start Aug 29, cool?' NO! even figure that's going help. like tossing drop water forest fire. No? There's articles That's I'm going say ""I agree"" people rest life. worst part lay something someone simple logic make easy understand like “But saw thing Facebook.”. Yeah. turns out, people really dumb.  Sorry, Hollywood. worst thing US healthcare employer provided. wish could work job without worry kind benefits offered. asymptomatics still PEs, strokes, heart attacks, etc Well exactly right *now*, don’t want quarantine 14 days wiping us That’s good question, one that’s pissing us working places said won’t enforcing customers, aside asking politely wear one. say no, nothing. Good, deserve go business aren’t interested safety communities. NOTE: BNO deleted re-published Tweet, found  Farting patchouli oil public encourage distancing. I'm kidding. What’d five fingers say face!? Wtf got coronavirus.
Broncos looking excuses suck Yeah protests nothing  really dont know right wrong. f ed belligerent childish attitude people refuse put masks old. *IT'S YOU. GET YOURSELF.* 

Its everyone, stopping virus lifelong health implications they're starting see, people wear masks outside homes forever. longer people throw toddler tantrums, longer get shunned rest world idiots. 

What's next? leaders decide public safety repeatedly defy mask orders get put quarantine camps keep 'spreaders' contained? We're gonna die, we... love name. single? long since gym? see it, you’re paying tuition degree, experience (in eyes university). 100% agree tuition hybrid mostly online classes, university, you’re still getting credits you’re still year closer completing getting degree proudly hang up, broadcast, put resume move next chapter. It’s expensive, sad reality many students face year unfortunately. That’s thought. 4 days ago everyone mask on, Today first day I’ve seen employee here, whether restaurant grocery store, without mask wondered. Username checks heard school districts actually distributed hotspots students need. I'm going take guess guess applauded pissing trillion dollars wind pump stock market bail companies rather giving people actually needed it. Realistically, triage situation could avoided. talking about? minority what?

I thought telling someone hang tree meant kill hanging.

I'm American really know group throwing assuming racist.

Sure I'll take downvotes. Enjoy projecting among fellow sheep. Replies off. better time get pre reqs done CC Yep! Austin Convention Center going overflow hospital capacity. Wait, arent people said couple weeks ago rare transmit asymptomatic? explicitly unconstitutional close state borders. except misinformation there? Mandate masks. city called Tampa area called Tampa Bay. Tampa Bay made several counties. county made smaller cities towns. dozens. couldn’t even name them. 

The city Tampa is, course, Tampa Bay area. yes, bay called Tampa Bay. 

The city 400k people whole Tampa Bay area around 3 million. There's thread somewhere Reddit. one class day, airflow building, cubes cleaned everyday. something like that. This:
""...cohorts donors (total n = 203) Sweden, used “open” strategy, durable spread, COVID-19 many countries Europe"".

Why even mention Swedens strategy ""durable"" report political?

Apart that; almost everyone study confirmed Covid also developed antibodies. article preprint peer-reviewed \[what mean?\]. reports new medical research yet evaluated *not* used guide clinical want point peer-reviewed. going dismiss reports peer-reviewed yet, apply standards here. addition...has anyone actually read article? Much based cremation assumptions, estimations hearsay. really new information regarding cremation claims. Additionally, paper cites Epoch Time source.

If researchers want remain reputable, higher standards cite sources like Epoch C. Amid virus outbreak, funeral home officials Wuhan reveal sharp increase cremations. recall antibody test done China revealed 3.2%\~3.8% 17,368 individuals tested antibodies (this study **peer-reviewed** [SCMP make sense use number calculate number deaths COVID-19?

Wuhan population 10-11M according mayor Zhou Xianwang, 5M people left Wuhan prior lockdown (source: [Business remaining people Wuhan 5-6M people. use number combined antibody test number figure many people Wuhan virus apply average CFR based data countries infer number deaths (source: [Mortality data preliminary approach. think also another piece data that's missing, people antibodies, many asymptomatic many symptomatic. Without knowing this, likely number deaths would inflated many asymptomatic people (discovered via antibody testing) would considered 'case' therefore, CFR would count death makes sense. think reality, CFR countries much lower.

Finally, want say word usage title/post makes sound politically charged evidence prove government suppressed data. really proof data suppressed, data provided inaccurate. likely case all/most countries healthcare system became overwhelmed. **I think fact scientists China conducted antibody test determine true infection numbers run counter narrative purposely obfuscating data.**

There really good book talks aware cognitive biases comes statistics [Thinking Fast Slow Daniel anyone interested. wish wasn’t case. Nobody hate whether brown, black color. referred Europe bloc. wouldn’t compare apples apples? There’s border control around Fairfax County.  I'm WNY. awesome, cases continue drop daily everything open. Glad I'm area handling somewhat well Bay Area much aggressive LA numbers support it. Newsom fold pressures opening things across state much quickly, however. even July yet , #2020shit speed run something? people much sensitive racial issues class issues. elites want Like said think you’re defining “burn out” uncontrollably spread population longer spread anymore. Whereas I’m saying that’s ALWAYS happens, create situations isolate, contract trace, vaccinations, etc. “control burn” inability understand Westerners think.
Obviously Easterners Westerners look one thing differently, wonder Westerners think way
The Chinese saying, ""我不理解他们的脑回路.""
It means wonder think that. started people saying ""I care get it"" wear mask.

So people saying ""wear mask protect others, yourself."" morphed ""Yeah masks protect you, protect others!""

At least that's gone little area. try simple voodoo rituals blood letting help COVID19. bet assumptions generalizations. 

There number simple exercises, literally simple nicking skin let evil spirits out. could 5 minutes.  Ironic people go gym healthy, turns gym possibly least healthy place right now. form lockdown since 8th June. New arrivals quarantined though. Bring national guard? know big California is? think idea plexiglass put barrier direct line customers sneeze cough cashiers face.  may also wear masks, adjust HVAC system, even furniture room. Doesn’t “10:1 odds it’s cop” imply it’s UNlikely it’s cop? you’re paying $10 every $1 event cop. 



If likely cop wouldn’t pay lot everyone would bet Like putting band aid giant wound.  get first wave acted quickly decisively. would look nice.. amount time energy required.. worth it? say entire US? area shouldnt controlled happens thousand miles away. 2 positive cases today county density 800/sq mile. That's dense playing along.  known kids ok Coronavirus while- fact turn spreaders dangerous everyone responsible caring It’s moments like it’s almost 100% assured f’ed species. Even something straight forward virus many people willing drink counter culture koolaid actively attempt bring everyone else them. It’s absolutely depressing beginning people can’t effectively contemplate reason. things begin get worse (global warming, lack species diversity, water scarcity) watch people’s stupidity kick compound growing problems. Another theory go along incremental exposure helps build immunity virus. ""~~We're~~ **we were** screwed."" idea Wisconsin, findings Texas showing bars clusters. Texas even let people choose last meal anymore. Someone ordered 10 buckets chicken shit changed policy.

EDIT: nazi ordered bunch food eat Texas allow last supremacist Lawrence Russell Brewer, 44, served two chicken fried steaks gravy sliced onions, triple-patty bacon cheeseburger cheese omelet beef mince, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers jalapenos, New York Times reported. enough, also given fried okra ketchup, pound barbecued meat half loaf white bread, three fajitas meat pizza. dessert served pint ice cream peanut butter fudge crushed peanuts. given three root beers wash down. eat it. shudder thought... expected better Americans work together instead fighting containing virus freedom. Seems lot people Illinois firmly believe they're immune possibility illness. masks inside bars, gyms, even grocery stores expressing personal freedom oppressive government. Probably would take long, either. ability would require will. enough time yeah it’s always true far. Walmart allowed open pay lobbyists Lesson learned: never underestimate stupid, petty, spiteful stupid people be. Yes, said stupid twice; can't over-emphasized. Us inhabitants “Mountains” taken masks social distancing surprisingly seriously. (I think realized tiny hospitals would overwhelmed immediately.)

Unfortunately, effort gone window lately, huge influx summer tourists larger cities. Force worst plan available watch fast make things better everybody. wouldnt consider reciprocative thing. would consider common sense. country going allow people dangerous country shows somewhat improvement.

Americans better satisfied staying US forseeable future. Good news really amazing places America: “no thanks, don’t want any.” get that. I’m older now, I’m concerned pandemic. wear masks go groceries, pretty much stayed home otherwise since mid March. don’t know oblivious 2009. This. ""Freedom"" overrated.

This good news. close, yet far Perhaps virus high vibrance. average healthy person could shed 2 week frame led believe. tail end event go one way another Damn still leaves 10% people tell wear masks though...Kudos able deal people! think I'd patience myself. Species adapt pressure selection. isn’t conscious thought virus. think article old written outbreak even started here. it’s worthless.

Given outbreak China effectively controlled, conditions place Phase III clinical trial conducted.

Chinese News Translation
Why vaccine phase III clinical trials need done overseas?

Duan Kai, director Wuhan Institute Biological Products, introduced clinical studies usually divided three phases. first phase evaluate safety. Phase II evaluate safety immunogenicity vaccine explore immunization process. Phase III mainly evaluates safety efficacy vaccine larger population range.

""Given domestic epidemic effectively controlled conditions Phase III clinical trials, new crown vaccine, clinical research, go abroad places outbreak high. Safety evaluations conducted throughout clinical studies. phase III clinical trials successful, means vaccines safe, effective protect vaccinated population new coronavirus infection."" stated. Death rate low, great! aware track coronavirus, right? constant issues dealing world? work Yemen example, dealing worst cholera outbreak recorded history dealing civil war? 

Criticize mistakes, claiming point shows immense never rely now. Well fair, I'm (several billion times less successful Bill Gates though), thought something like would unite people country together fight common cause. know many people actually expected things turn like warnings scientists, seeing happened Spain/Italy, seeing happened state country. Live Salem see people masks. “Becoming” politicized? It’s way since like March think NYC first normalcy. while. It’s becoming apparent even small amount percentage (like 30%) people slows virus quite bit. I’m saying stops it, places getting hard little exposure before. hope Sasha Baron Cohen trolls people dressing waiter mask, completely naked waist sees mask-deniers react that. find kitchen staff also nude. mean, mask isn’t required, shirt/no shoes rule apply? Plenty though. know locals still went DJais, bunch selfish idiots single person wearing mask distancing owners bouncers looked putting onus force patrons responsible. Unknown side effects hitting small group people catch testing. Almost mask orders apply customers indoor businesses. ones mention outdoors require wearer around people. Montana similar order, it'd apply necessary. necessary, even people Montana go stores churches such. Wow, that's Bezos earns what, week? get hayfever weather gets hot live due heavy crops back march (I know it’s hayfever get exact symptoms every year without fail roughly around time)

Maybe hadn’t sitting around taking bribes overreact little coronavirus back December January would big problem now. problem, many people social distancing. show money I’m honest, Americans seem quite arrogant attitude “being best everything”. It’s like excuse ignore everything issues society. country perfect. close people simply willing accept going go this. going happen. way past it. Dragging feet prevent inevitable deaths. delays them. need keep eye hospitals, that's really metric matters. places may need apply brakes there. places really need pick pace. lockdowns started &amp; every single state locked exact time entire month maybe even 2.. safe.. could’ve trace &amp; isolate level could handled.. wouldn’t sacrifice much economy &amp; would already.  including lives would’ve saved.  It’s extremely sad politicized VIRUS.  huge mistake... honestly believe don’t reform education system &amp; critical thinking classes ... won’t last long. Oh wait! market care EPS multiples rather liquidity driven moral malaise. 

aaand.... they're gone. millions, they're gone. people may wear masks they're road riding scooters, people wear masks day day basis walking around. 

Here pics found internet various spots Shanghai see people masked

[The Shanghai that's recall names places top head. doubt vastly different elsewhere though. Knucklehead?!? gotta honest y'all, i'm choosing thread it. clue feel new shutdowns, honestly really hard process. 

I work private security supervisor, i've got 10 guards i'm responsible for. We're licensed state's Department Public Safety, takes lengthy background check get approved for. 

We told clients started laying people due Covid, ""your job safe, may sent critical site, pay may taken state DPS."" Apparently, thing happen crisis. site essential whatsoever (even though declared essential Ohio fucking stupid,) told might pulled sent places like water treatment facilities power plants, places super essential crisis. happy it, that's takes keep area going, bring on. 

Our client already gone back full capacity, short-term layoffs (during many employees found better jobs.) second shutdown coming, already know look like, local health departments corrupt fuck, value keeping jobs public health. 

At time, alternative approach hundreds people lose jobs can't access broken unemployment system, appears designed handle six people. 

In broken, red, hillbilly state, positive solution Covid. system built SOMEONE suffer. AGREED. businesses require enter, enforcing It. It’s really discouraging see many seem care actions affect others. oft-misunderstood term ""herd immunity"" looks option point, last result we've failed contain every way imaginable treatment/vaccine options time catch saturation US population. I've seen estimates 75% 85% seroprevalence needed R0 &lt; 1 - assuming full conferred immunity - that's around 260 million infected people. What's latest IFR estimate? Yeah idk. Also jeez Los Angeles..  good article. People read it. make sense. we're gonna shut fucking beach, need shut places facilitate indoor transmission. no. shove urethra upvote 69. Winning too. texans cared shame , admit texas... Mitch McConnell needs get **FOXNEWS** start saying this. They're even putting Corona articles webpage anymore. Meanwhile, they're watched cable news network USA. shutter go back thought! guess answer “Dear God, no!” doubt Center Disease Control Maybe older folks. messed up. bars open, MANY, they’ve regular summer crowds weekends.

Article town paper quotes positive students said going bars one staff wearing masks. Scientists believe things science requires it.

There risk earth could destroyed interstellar object merely saying seems exaggerate risk.

If know anything risk cannot avoid it. people collapsing China? seen say, America? know increases things like clotting cause strokes, that? honestly cannot wrap mind around this. hard go taco place, put mask on, get tacos, take mask leave? takes that. AUS NZ isolated islands power control borders. American states isolated able control borders. many differences too, least massive disparity population. Could imagine still Christy there? banner public transportation lmao precisely. worse troubling... back February / March people throngs bars, beaches, restaurants, shopping centers like witnessed weekend. Narrator: *Little know, would soon losing.*   OMG, thought thing! can't nice things. mom finds creepy, thinks he’s trying block sun, much money......never shoulda made Facebook. Ugh Hope get iron man suits it.. Hmmm, maybe he's credible? smart?? Ok where’s evidence? PROTESTERS especially since clearly ones spreading it. Bro, I've lifting decade nobody. Lol 
 
And yes, almost nobody truly lifts weights general population. I'm talking consistently strength trains. Walk anywhere normally would see 1 50 people look like lift. can’t constitutionally enforced nothing actually done “enforce it.” it’d great enforceable, isn’t. make people think is.

Now said - private business whatever wants, including enforcing mask wearing. BIDETS! Unless becomes yearly thing. poop saw decided blame someone else 100% guessing know situation media, lack personnel hospital beds problem, possibly? realized fucking lost argument BIG TIME look like idiots played politics human safety epic proportions. give points, may god mercy souls. I’m interested see goes. mask mandate enforced? live CO now, don’t statewide mandate, masks strongly encouraged. course reality varies place place. wonder CO mandates masks, people really comply? I’m interested see goes KS. conservative relatives Wichita area surely won’t like this. (But I’m happy elderly parents living there)  scary part, people said virus dangerous. seen China, Italy, NYC real problem hospitals themselves, shut months prevent exactly this.

Congratulations America, played yourself.  I'm glad someone else finally gets it.

What thoughts part Trump's comment - said test injection disinfectants? recent article *Lancet* published February received little attention MSM, I'm curious think what's take results?

Citation case seen yet, seem like well-informed.

Oliver TH, Murphy MB (2/21/20). ""Viral Pneumonia: Intravenous Injection Hydrogen Peroxide."" *The Lancet* 195(5034) pp. 432-433. DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)11118-9.  got tested last Thursday, said 2-4 days results... see. true Australia's NZ's circumstances exactly applicable USA, however using example measures place people smart adhere measures, successfully combat control virus. think virus affecting USA long, people become numb threat virus still holds. all, global pandemic, 1 100 year event. little late. Can’t wait vote out. show fucked situation across country, california reporting 8.3k day puts slightly national average new cases per 100,00. Yypou said it, I'm awesome cook cook above, chili rellano, nope. Living brought cuisines tongue, pocketbook made learn make That’s case, saw paper scarring lung tissue patients diamond princess cruise. forget exact medical term , scarring known fully heal permanent/semi permanent. try find you’re interested Since people wear masks easily recognize social media, maybe track anyone consistently refused wear mask public gets triage tent hospital's parking lot. make protesters go home stop spreading virus town. seriously going believe man billions dollars invested billions dollars industry probably among going see boom make even billions dollars? None garbage best interest gym, tan, die preventable pandemic... Oh thanks comment! Donate worthy cause reddit please. comment pure gold &lt;3 I’m teacher, too. I’ll maternity leave October scared death go back. I’m unbelievable scared get sick bring back family. live building good chunk older people (my theory bought condos 40years ago new grew old it)

Anyways, elevator arrived today, got little old lady dashed towards enter (she waiting me). soon saw lack mask clicked close button said ""Sorry, wearing mask, wait next one""

fuck little old lady, protecting me, benefit mask protecting her. personally think give special ed kids option person schooling them.  scary thing NYC point locked period time already. fact Arizona started requiring masks nothing locked absolutely horrifying. 2 4 weeks it’s going real mess there. It’s out. 

How flopped?

Also, it’s fucking Hamilton. wasn’t good, would reshot it. bunch people get together someone house worry trumps got nuke 

88% per last week, according article doesn’t even account overflow 

And 83% two weeks ago. Couldn’t find single source stating AZ 100% capacity. Either blatant fearmongering, parroting numbers without looking shit yourself. Idk worse going much anymore. people get fed stay-at-home orders start go out? Makes sense. actually reports protests good number ppl wear masks numbers spiked. wish someone handing masks like condoms. due increased testing, right? There's vomit sweater already gotta blame governors terrorists protesting, rioting, looting murdering people left right last month social distancing YELLING aerosolizes virus allowing spread further, yeah NOTHING sudden massive spike started week protests started increasing every day since cases back dated based symptoms. 

Georgia open MONTH HALF major resurgence, minor uptick cases, came Protests BAM HUGE SURGE currently new highest day 2.5 times higher previous peak likely climb higher. Also age group people 18-30 age group age group protesters. SERIOUSLY OPEN EYES, protesters organized thousands streets spreading shit. Thanks. live Asia we're stupid enough ignore obvious. Frankly would pandemic people around world took seriously us. bad, might say rather, luckily memeing Asians took priority. u/Vessing, wanted say gold something else, I'd give you. kind yet expressed know true. Many people can't anymore. type response encourages conversation potential transformation instead shutting down. 🎉🏅 student friends students, say **most** us don’t care learning unless effect grades. Like normal school study lot try well tests, without affect grade/GPA, isn’t enough incentives make care. lot learn forgotten 5 years, it’s really hard gather motivation learn without tested otherwise benefit GPA. Save links. people behaving like children start back whole attacking side claiming ""traditional values"" taken away, remind childish acted, remind dying hill decided die on. grandparents spout sorts conspiracy theories claim beliefs assault, listen think know better everyone else, hiding behavior, appalling need held accountable going forward. would ton teachers without jobs. say food insecurity thing could easily fixed delivery service teachers could free lunches kids.

As far aa abuse, kids already stuck parents 16 hours day. I'll say, 8 may drive parents crazy I'd say fewer people die abuse thy probably already getting would kids spreading covid adults.  Sad weigh two options do. Summer heat part Marin? really, tops 75-80 lows around 50-55.

North Marin Novato gets hot fuck though. McDonnels keeping thier coffee 20 degrees hotter part thier policy compared coffee shops typical 160 degrees. 20 degrees drastically decreases time needed major burns.

It didnt help mcdonnels internal research people drank thier coffee immediately trip, argued coffee needed 180+ people weren’t drinking soon purchase.

That woman wanted reimbursed 20k medical expenses major disfigurement, mcdonnels countered 800. try getting first wave first speculate second one 🤦‍♂️ 😀. Thank you! rather pleased it! (I'm sure must done before) Maybe free food realistic way healthcare system changed US? insurance companies hold much power anything budge? reeks Russian psyops.  said “no country comes close numbers”

Then cherry picked two islands haven’t flu season yet Canada isn’t bad USA isn’t terribly far either. also advantage couple true metros. 

For instance California (41 mil) similar population Canada (37 mil) 2500 fewer deaths.

And sorry, part original errant statement included line “it doesn’t take genius” followed making poor statistical statement hit back. Well said. Hospitals losing money. Hospital systems bread butter elective surgeries. Covid takes LOT resources (especially critical cases end ICU weeks months, rehab unit several months) many patients uninsured/will never pay. blame Senate actually start something bills House passed refusing even look at. looked up. first believed probable novel influenza March 2009 identified US CDC April. October first vaccine approved. months later, maybe January, recall Obama running vaccination campaign urging everyone get it. child would mask glove sanitizer hand take you. Keep car windows open. you’re house risk especially share facilities. Maybe friend young healthy? could also see mobile unit testing. cities/towns hot line. could call recommendation. could also lay low ride feel can’t breathe need call ambulance. private insurers US, they'll charge $3,120, America. Government-backed health systems including UK’s NHS negotiate aggressively drugmakers price, meaning could end paying less Gilead’s proposed $2,340 per course.

But US, Medicare allowed negotiate drug prices. symptom, like infectious disease declared pandemic yet? remember doubts.... Tokyo highest population density world, they’re literally fraction entire country literally every single highly populated state think one one. 

Why people continue try dismiss threat? Honest question, what’s going take finally take seriously instead 🤷‍♂️ they’ve got people? understand we’re losing hard thing, continue worst country handling mile said attitude “meh” 100% contributes making problem worse? sister went fitness convention wants fly see go gym.... happening Governor Laura Kelly Kansas Governor Kate Brown Oregon, 4 🟦🐴 governors left issued statewide mask orders:

* Jared Polis Colorado

* John Bel Edwards Louisiana

* Steve Bullock Montana

* Tony Evers Wisconsin

Per NYTimes, cases [have last 14 days 4 states, here's hoping join herd!

On 🟥🐘 side, 2 governors issued statewide mask orders:

* Larry Hogan Maryland

* Charlie Baker Massachusetts

So that's 20/24 🟦🐴 governors statewide mask orders, 2/26 🟥🐘 governors same. partisan issue, is. Incredibly so. media play date right now. virus sucks it’s scary sensationalizing nothing cause unnecessary stress. manage put right. least country least half people know apparently.. Arizonan would forever call botched effort combat effects natural disaster ""dropping Ducey."" Time start shorting Please stop threatening That’s type incentive people it. classes would less crowded less likely spread.  thanks!!!!  build come Oh, worries!

She tablet years and, sticky fingers, takes care it. 

Also, would watch they're overpriced break it. Lol starve without workers COVID bad people working age. fake one. Adults 40 spike cases, people mild symptoms low risk complications able get tested?

The second story boring one... hope first! Wait, close restaurant dining? Less risky done strictly still seems like unmasked indoor activities like would problem. Aperture Laboratories. eh, seeing plenty people without masks Hamilton. think first two third. 😂😂😂 sure prices countries high, countries may declare patent Remdesivir invalid [Taiwan Tamiflu H1N1 That's cost materials make drugs. completely ignoring everything said. question, happened NYC (and places, like Italy) terrible. New York really unlike much America. Also, early knew anything it. 

The big fear hospital capacity, I've seen minimal evidence recently suggest that's legitimate concern right innkther places. America: country people value freedom much, simply asking care little others akin constitutional infringement freedom. country told best healthcare world- always lie wanted believe it, 401k pharma stock.

We told public institutions model world. Instead proved cannot put together coherent response threat large faced. failure one man- country whole actually ability face challenge.

We told economy envy world. turns stock market simply speculation market .1% losses passed poor. stocks go 401k might large enough retire die....

Straight article, numbnuts

“So far 1 death every 1,166 people 65 years old (compared 1 death every 358 people general population). 89% times, person died one underlying medical conditions.” I’m ok “shitty human being” long it’s infected human went protest, got exposed, spread around bars restaurants (who close) God knows else. time conservative states face heat Covid spikes come senses fucking political issue.  California would information states - information prisons serious outbreak hot spots. known. sometimes, yeah forget kidneys yeah, think it’s safe say clue what’s going Nice Dal, cheers guys!  Tennessee ridiculous. governor sort 'tried' issuing mandates, kind floats away mayors handle things. look great that's going. one followed grand reopening guidelines. Cases going shit continuing open, masks required. Shelby county children's museums opens, children's play spaces, water parks, look around like ""Gee, hospitals full."" dumb. every one sense seems position enforcement. Shameful embarrassing. Obviously lot racists California  thoughts Zona closing barber shops salons? Covid spread places well? Using anecdotal evidence vs science create policy. going go well. HEPA filters 99.97% efficient stopping virus-size particles. fair think HEPA filter N100 mask building -- specs, performance. friend Chicago said cluster weekend crowds. hope spike totals back up. 

I'm downstate IL one cares here. awful. bars crowded weeks. cases really low fear coming everyone decided go vacation. friend went Texas someone neighborhood Florida right now. guarantee neither mask wearing families.

Well things really better right season tickets local summer college ball team. allowing like 25% capacity stadium everyone distanced feel comfortable enough going. Looking forward enjoying something hours 3ish nights week.  put basically kid till we're 25 get ahead life. knows gives leaves house fire matter seconds movie theaters really open? That's one thing never seemed open back around here. Though might company choice guess. 2020 strikes again. Wonder August store... u even know China works ? Oh boy, field hospitals finally put challenge! think need use completely different angle people. Play paranoia. Tell much difficult ""deep state cameras"" track they're wearing mask. Tell whole ""mask thing"" godsend legit wear masks &amp; sunglasses avoid tracked gubmint. Even spin people like Jones oppose mask wearing deep deep state operatives want make easy ""the AI cameras"" track freedom loving 'mericans.   There’s probably greater chance first positive result false positive. fuck tour before? Don’t forget Anthony Fauci Jerome Adams first told everyone wear masks. Fauci said *dangerous* wear mask weren’t health care provider. like round 1 second fighter still round 1 first fighter. *only* protect others, regular facemasks gaps, going suck air gaps cloth (less resistance).

So help you, yes, minuscule amount vs much helps *others* catching you. original comment's point, fact one else wearing one means still much risk - even risk reduced slightly wearing mask. 
I suspect complete unbiassed report end investigation... Thanks New strains flu discovered regular basis. never news news everybody click link cha-ching. Ah! Yes. right. sucks.  drug moderation correct way help, even heroin great pain - point ""moderation"" really difficult thing addictive substances - I'm perfectly fine Alcohol (and drugs!) legal - point society Alcohol seems ""fun"" drug - look advertising: parties, women, fast cars!

Guys, save form scaremongering 2021? hold ""IS RETURN CORONAVIRUS?!"" stories 2024, like 5 people never vaccinated contract Utah Cuba shit. Good call, dont really understand America got top PPE, sat warehouse waiting distributed? Trump wants excuse postpone elections NJ peaked mid April, properly right ship 6-8 weeks. Force mask wearing indoors, keep dining outdoors, limit indoor gatherings, test test test. Push school til September, feasible rising states need take measures right now. can’t reinfect mask. haven’t fully recovered. Feel better! best guess days school middle risk activity highly dependent community case loads. case loads low, schools won’t made worse. case loads community higher, amplify problem.

I hope antibody testing kids look happened. That's state :') exactly tone Gov. Pritzker's announcement March 15th.

Planned closure would much less economically harmful unplanned closures infection rate completely control. Idk. evidence shows protest issue. 

And people refusing follow guidelines? Yes, probably. northeast almost wiped lot places, people responsible. need cops locking people crazy fines. Leadership good explain daily we're locked down, progress is, what's going on, make sure people protected pay rent get food, etc... Huh. went elementary school Phoenix early 90s (Hidden Hills Paradise Valley) then. Sounds nice, actually. kids get kind antsy almost three-month summer break.

Also survive mean lifelong complications result. Several MD’s mentioned kidney liver complications, well reduced lung strength recovered patients. Upvoting I've heard/read various reports epidemiologists public health officials stating yet seen cases could contact-traced back protests. I'm gonna believe them.

However, know 70+ new cases stemming bar shut Michigan. might exact problems, instead ton problems uniquely waiting around say measures. question whether measures sweden took caused death toll go level comparable worst past outbreaks. 

Comparing death toll average flu season makes sense, one implements harsh measures even highly average flu season, let alone average one. personal opinion, probably. ever challenged far enough find out? Doubtful. Seems case plans survive contact enemy. fear pan poorer countries still. We're playing time they're comparatively well far fear change. certain point means contain anymore. fuck can't hear later cloth? Grow man wear mask Thanks, are! best wishes frienda cases yes that's true, deaths though. Also economy fucked countries closed down. also also come pretty far towards achieving herd immunity. better sleeping mask better camping *Houston left chat* guys need predators Australia. Maybe Canada Russia send guys bunch Grizzly bears, would love Kangaroo meat According MSM folks live die party line brain allowing think themselves, wear mask bleeding heart liberal democrat conservative republican think virus hoax even get sick republican blood defeat virus. Duh! /s (if even necessary)

Don't believe hype! Think yourselves. encourage wear mask public around others.  choose wear face covering, private businesses operating private property absolute right enforce discriminatory access. like it, USA right go somewhere else. 

As far public areas, local state officials signed emergency legislation mandating face coverings wish wear one, don't. issue this, continue #staythefuckhome. Look don’t mean scare anyone, it’s caution wind bro. believe resilience humans persevere overcome what’s us now, I’m actually optimistic. also giving fellow people heads caution. really feel like I’m fearmongering take post scare anyone. forget I’m easily scared certain things. follow trail corporations money circulated BMGF prior covid, see profit. Depends state. Theres like 4 decent contact tracing. quarantining basically left unless hospitalized many cases. Since least 2015. Scientists warned super pandemic years. mean, government spent first months pandemic saying 1) don’t wear masks, 2) masks don’t work, 3) wearing masks makes Chinese people feel bad virus came China makes look like there’s problem. experts can’t tell everyone “no masks” months switch “we wear masks you’re killing people” dime expect political pushback. wear mask wearing mask even since Illinois required mom doctor said “yeah, don’t listen government, wear mask” start, also understand turned political flashpoint. lied masking, people think they’re telling truth masking? 30-50 range pretty significant risk too. Damnit! house indoors! There's logic. many people work, better open back up. Yes one chance encounter get it.

99.3% America diagnosed.

Live life, wear mask, wash hands live life guy undoubtedly piece shit isn’t first time happened.

Humans evolve genetic resiliency new pathogens years, takes generations. 

You return getting information looking now. nice day💞✌️😷 going lie, pretty smooth. Also, things like seatbelt laws? unconstitutional? may right, suspect amount times published today editors field day new scaremongering story. Québec... last time freaked like store 5, grandma made sure never happened again. actually referring people genuine mental disorders. people whack-jobs. Well fair also BC's 4.6m people vs Cali's almost 40m. yeah, congrats keeping things mostly wraps there. kinda dropped ball Québec (thank snowbirds sprink breakers basically every bar restaurant bar going business NJ. Mental illness equal mental deficiency quite frankly post insulting everyone suffering anything similar this. Mental illness gets enough discrimination already thx confirm. I'm south lived Eugene baffled see Confederate flags... Nurses arbitrarily deny care. That's grounds losing licenses. manpower resources treat everyone prioritize take care first. person trouble breathing receive care someone UTI even though first. one nurses come trying conceal cough today. people fucking stupid. Indoor gatherings riskiest thing do. 

Packing beach great, there's wind sun. Inside bar, restaurant? air exchanged nearly enough. Many places sealed ventilation, never get fresh air. Taking, eating, produces expelled air particles. also tend face someone eating, sit alongside killing time beach. 

Exposure name game. Imagine fog machine, indoors gathers, outdoors desperses.

Don't indoor idiot. Probably lot bots made foreign states. science tought state?
one states science optional?
Children learning weird ""history"", magical beings? don’t understand exactly self entitlement selfishness comes America, it’s pervasive, Trump emboldened it. guys BC better pray leader keeps US/Canada border closed else watch cases BC sky rocket border reopens US opened retired nurses doctors come back, well final year nurses doctors work, treating specific thing like Corona instead wide variety normally deal easily viable. wasn’t needed, created quite lot extra capacity.

March banned international travel April 3 week lockdown. Vietnam’s economy back normal (for part) whereas shitstorm starting US. 

These things US could done didn’t. New York gotten close cases declining. Success failure community depends leadership. US none. We've always disposable versions. Base white color colors varying size? Thats normal. Iirc Red obese, baby blue kids. Blue normal. turn around.

That simply true. There's lag confirmed cases deaths people take time die covid. dealing unmitigated exponential growth differences huge numbers increase quickly. Depends define high percentage. 1% die, even another 1% develop permament damage world wide disaster allowed infect almost whole population. Check nz government responded.

Yeah, guys cases per 1M people countries Europe population Yeah kind people refuse wear masks understand Yeah another lockdown needed, unfortunately still business, law enforcement, people comply. really screwed badly need vaccine/cure. Even people refuse take it. *flees* Personally, no. want free testing, may 45 minute drive way get tested northern county network.

So yes, free county, shit's still stupid universally covered (Tennis effect?)

  
They might well contain bounces. accountability terrible. conclusion also kinda bad. know discover virus take several nasal swabs pig farms around country, part disease surveillance program, even America one test farm animals.

As long industries humans animals continue interact, risk another pandemic causing zonotic diseases always presents. Anyway, disease surveillance programs exist, total fault one country race, responsibilities also collectively us. next pandemic disease always come China.

There’s much right find funny people sure things. 

You're missing point. I'm saying wait making statements COVID-19 vaccine *until COVID-19 talk about.* 

Everything discussed speculation people repeating weird conspiracy shit read saw somewhere online.

Once vaccine there, something substantial talk about. Assuming Union would survive. need dental cleaning (visible dental calculus build up, last dental visit 3 years ago I'm uninsured) there's telling it'll safe visit dental office. know happens restaurants go under? People lose jobs. know happens people lose jobs? can't feed families. become depressed. become abusive. become suicidal. picture massive scale. 

This pandemic binary. not, condescendingly put it, ""grandma dies"" grandma die. 

There problems sides. Big problems. Solutions need account damage caused virus lockdown. know would guardian even seeing link. UK tabloids love write types articles Italy. made comment back span 5 weeks Guardian written 3 articles coronavirus mafia Italy. Doesn’t Uk it’s problems worry about? UK government well. common sense completely window.

You reversed it’s going slowly decline likely continue long long time. Isn’t fantastic. World leader declining graphs. 

Meanwhile Nordic neighbours hardly decline they’ve pretty much hit bottom. long term side effects and/or ineffectiveness believe it, also shame anyone opposes naturally makes react defensively. prevents changing mind, literally makes continue believing opposite believes whether truly believe not. end accomplish nothing responsible go against. surprised wins end year, see mean.  Think I'm gonna load puts though fucked reopening economy feel soon im thinking months maybe half year sell crashes. I’m also fine accepting 5-10 year long recession/depression order save lives.

It's cold thing consider *how many lives* part statement matters. Yup. ""Murica"" say making exceptions people ""essential businesses"". Hence one plane Germany confirmed cases.

Still, case 4 must damn essential business and/or right connections government able bring wife daughter June.  Uh wtf  fair, hard tell much things cost ER, also depending ER for. come country private healthcare well, call hospitals ask much something cost, give estimate. ask ER, they'll tell know (but usually need put money payment show insurance anything cost lot). Wahh everyone direct comparison neccesarily, swine flu vaccine 70's rushed didnt turn great. That's great universal generalization actually apply cases got there. I’ll trade issues. Except winter. I’m northern US I’m certain don’t want winter. bad enough. made laugh loud, thank Yep, that's happened. Ugh, number sobering. 

The fact death rate lower good, let's hope stays way, scary thing even kill, docs case speculating could cause permanent - least long-lasting - pulmonary damage well virus already done. 20-30 years I'd imagine we're gonna uptick severe COPD sufferers (or other, similar lung disorder), even among non-smokers.

We hope Oxford vaccine works point. quickest way ends, even that's getting us October - best case scenario. work, we're waiting another one, happening 2021. way late stop spread (short martial law mandatory lockdown barest skeleton crew people keep essential services running), compounded *brilliant* people somehow *still* taking seriously (read: awful, selfish people non-hyperbolically destroying lives killing people RIGHTS).

Brace impact, guys. end this, almost us Americans going know someone passed bastard virus. I'm already one them.

And god's sake, wear mask. think China still banning general foreign citizens enter China. so, could Case 3 daughter enter China? I'm beginning think big event end civilization know it. wore damn maga hat. Now, now, Mississippi also wins worst state education!

Edit: obesity! Looks like we’ll August. needs testing made available applying compassionate use proven effective. Even that, something adding up. trust anything coming TX FL, considering things like [Law spread continues. Great Courses series black death Amazon people whole range reaction. Everything saw back then, see days. Luckily pogroms one reactions, I'm sure people want *someone* blame [if even believe real]. 

It free watch end month. Surprisingly, look infection rates overall numbers, upstate killing it. Rochester gold standard mitigation control, opened phase 4 lot upstate close behind. 

I think mix distances upstate PH run NY. Upstate, PH much part community. personally know PH director, events, talks county residents. helps lot says ""wear fucking mask."" Hyperinflation possible 

It’s barely matters much print, long it’s within 2% inflation. 

The Fed worried deflation partly one spending, suppose start would see average inflation never hyperinflation. Hyperinflation like 100% -1000% short period time US definitely ain’t going hyper inflate

Suppose Fed stop it’s another crash, continues sacrifice future economy present 

It’s already known stock market economy stay irrational longer stay solvent Okay Bill gates Thanks reply. source that? ask I've always heard wear masks primarily pollution, also avoid outbreaks. example, years we've seen images people China riding rail, wearing masks, even though people sick. This. There's amount ""stressing"" going get absolute fucking imbeciles comply. doubt there's single person city aware needs done. care.

We're point either make law real enforcement punishments, nothing. Surgical style, non-N9x masks protect others you. infected, exhale, masks trap viral-laden moisture. ten people wear masks, protect other. two people take masks infected, spread 8 normal surgical style masks good job trapping incoming viral particles mainly inbound air comes sides mask. Even masks fit better sides face enough obstacle prevent inhalation enough virus get sick. virus, cloth mask probably looks like Grand Canyon. gaps big. Yup, even talking bottles wine... too! health care workers telling like is.  Covid deadly what’s deadlier lack resources whether staff, beds, equipment cause pandemonium hospital floors. 

Everyone’s complaining rights 
Fighting use masks, social distance. Honestly going sound like crap.. wonder would happen front line (nurses docs) workers went strike since country seems okay putting lives risks. maybe finally wake stop selfish.


Nurses, Docs, EVS, Patient Transporters, etc families too, someone needs think expect? whole new class patron? Well, looks like you’re getting wish. Excuse friend, towns back way. us saving money food shelter. Source? Thank School already time order lifted. like week left school - get early.  urgent care anywhere $100-$200+ note say got cold... hurricane season cancelled earlier outbreak based fears shortage ppe healthcare workers. me, unnecessary swallow pill. countries large populations controlled much better have. Also, vaccine likely available spring.  think go remote learning spring semester least. time vaccine sight, try responsible openings. virus around months, years. need time learn expose children unknown complications possible disabilities. Southern California mess. entire area Santa Monica/los Angeles San Bernardino giant slate urban suburban sprawl. People drive additional ten minutes takes get la county city bar San Bernardino county city bar still open. screwed unless somebody somewhere level government grows damn spine makes difficult choices sooner rather later. *neck extension movement* someone break morons like me?  Damn wonder people broke. Fuck that. get orange mask  hot enough kill it, hope Arnold says ""Get CHOPPA"" Exactly. mention also takes time death statistic even reported.

The “death rate low” people apparently think receive positive test result, immediately die. Dr. Fauci said absolute soonest stars align could see vaccine October. don’t remember said that’s would roll though. Probably not. 20 million people dead terrible. 

But nuclear deterrence essential surviving Cold War turning China another battle ground proxy war like Korea. 

Fate alternative timeline would definitely worse. I've saying while... Anyone paid attention world history would seen coming. second gilded age sure. see America looking like developing country now, give five years.

If things keep heading Covid-19, know fact city, Las Vegas real issue keep hotels up, running, people employed. keeping properties well kept revenue coming in. 

We could well end like Detroit. basically single industry town. hospitality truly keeps town alive. figure something else become self sustaining. don't. fucked. Well lab responsible vaccine relocated Wuhan Beijing closer action opened vaccine development 26/01/2020, 3 days lockdown.

Needless say, went smoke shop bought bunch cbd didn’t resist said dr issue ever again. course US there. let us either honestly... average income shame anyone. said something Alex Jones. saying particularly forcefully either. that's takes warp someone's mind forever lost long ran across comments. 

I've heard line thinking (internet comment somehow leading electoral consequences oddly veiled tone), sounds like revenge fantasy anything. Someone made good point day. deaths Covid-19 gruesome horrifying peoples attitudes would changed completely. agree. 'y'all cant behave' irl Bars, gyms, theaters, waterparks. yes, point guy exactly that, people perspective skewed cause dumb af hear 3500. 3/4 americans probably idea many people live arizona. think nothing

same story every country, mine shit months ago I'm sorry look countries successful containing controlling virus Australia NZ. Social distancing adhered to, testing great numbers, ""delusion"" stop virus actually came true. US simply acted slowly enough synchronisation federal state governments, causing mass confusion allowing virus spread.  I’ve seen many posts complaining able go 4th. Yes live people beyond dumb. common thought “everything open, things normal again!” Oval Office upon suggestion cancel hurricane season: “Someone get Atlantic Ocean Gulf Mexico phone. STAT!” know what’s better paying taxes billions? spending billions first place. 

I’m totally familiar Gate Foundation efforts it’s understanding much 0 intent possibility making profit. 

When government fails invest technology future help disadvantaged people- let’s thankful good people world us. 

The fact people focus unfounded criticisms like actually blows mind. wear damn mask fucking twats  Especially house. often mental health. lock went long time people need mental support church brings. Generally I've seen, churches run stricter policy cut infections. true cases, mainly churches lot slow rate open need support. you? Spoiler alert: reopening cancelled untill widespread vaccine available. sick whole situation. blindly believe shouldnt turn one trust. Jesus, mass evacuation shelter scene would terrifying pandemic. agree totally. female, know female candidates didn’t “get” basic income like five seconds basic income great idea empowerment women. I’ve learned it, can’t think human needs issue UBI isn’t good idea help. keep focusing straight cash amount given Gilead. much facilities used cost? many university researchers got grants US government? many government scientists leave patent application?

And 1 billion cost self reported. I'd LOVE see itemized. ""500million lost revenue drug market.""

But please, tell Gilead deserve rewards. food primary business. serving alcohol primary business, cannot. saying restrictions introduced Sweden last weeks? Schools daycare centers. Watch ""BREAKING NEWS - Covid Riverside County"" live Arizona you’d shocked stupid people Facebook groups rn.

Wait...haven't available hospitals already? 65 over, anyone. Young doctors nurses died. Also, many teachers staff old. Finally, conditions like obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma affect young old. think we've practicing wrong thing... Florida: hold natty light watch this... number people Australia said ""not worry... president much power anyway."" Man wrong. Underrated comment. I’m teacher Georgia. summer break anything “break.” like spend summers preparing upcoming school year, idea I’m preparing *for*. know uneasy summer educators well. 

There contingency plan. Leaders slapped together something vaguely resembled “education” end last school year. Many us reasoned, end year anyway. time taken test prep. fumbled tried. Leaders months come something. Anything. get *nothing* instead.

On bright side say actually trust elected leaders whats best people state. Correct. That’s exactly I’m saying. That’s widespread mandate makes sense. It’s “personal choice” issue. wearing mask Isn’t risking it’s risking others. Incorrect. Source: CDC wearing mask similar drunk driving. hurt / kill others selfish choice. covid-19 cause death, cause death want put 200,000 people died year last year USA

according Elon Musk, shark bites, whatever BS things making ignore excessive death stats went Joe Rogan. 

Everything else overlooked get asshole twitter, whatever. guy meant driven data starts knowingly misrepresent he's annoyed car factory currently shut final straw. Zimbabwe too. CDC best funded organization kind world. done great work years past. completely failed early testing, argue huge part reason we're mess right now.

There zero reason CDC put testing eggs one basket. None. scientists clearly understood severity problem, mind boggling CDC leadership insisted developing tests strategy.

And FDA piled preventing local labs developing tests (instead of, say, letting develop tests treating positive results unconfirmed). 

At beginning honestly thought happened Trump appointed incompetent heads agencies. recently, Trump clarified - asked slow testing. 

The president moron. proof evidence, conjecture. That's always case though. worst gonna come first, they've bottling months. homemade mask made bandana beginning. Check community free masks - lot people making giving away can't afford buy one. (I'm NS). Fine. Every county goes way. choose enact restrictions must stay county. Deploy national guard exits enforce it. free want stay hell away everyone else. is. wear mask walking? True. specifically mentions friends testing positive, meeting possible spread outside sphere protests. However, without knowing friends symptoms, know. 14 countries \~160 *allowed* enter EU.

I also said beginning virus would let flood country even encourage spread order chaos confusion. 

Not conspiracy theories nuts theorists nuts. Absolutely every significant event history, especially resulting war, result conspiracy sort proven degree fact it’s hard blind oneself enough cognitive dissonance avoid fact existed almost every case. Don’t blame me. voted swine flu. India locked early, what's happening now?

I dont know India California missed masks part, aka: re-opening safely. soon phase 1 became phase 2 people turned dime right old world took precautions. result. know exactly who’s wearing mask isn’t? funny people try justify massive protests complaining three months people going beach. Agreed full stop. 

Anyone updates hospitals Houston? feel like last heard ""ICUs near 100 percent capacity"" hear nothing eerie say least... depends, talking white black lives here? care party. care Ohioans. Wear mask, safe. Stop thinking stop viewing blinders on. getting virus inevitable, difference wearing mask today make - kicking illness road hoping vaccine come; might well take one team, get sick stay home - terminal spread without mask infinitly societal value unknowingly spreading mask on. Minnesota colored red map? We’ve lower number cases, record high number tests, decreasing hospitalizations decreasing deaths since end May. proved cannot put together coherent response threat

Several states clearly done this; Northeastern U.S. seen pretty much ""New Infections"" curve Italy, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, New Zealand, etc., i.e. initial two four weeks exponential rise, followed two three month tail trends towards zero. that's spite initial assumption rapid spread Europe Italy, particular, concern. country, massive numbers people willingly went self-isolation, stayed home, worked home, things, states saw early infections spike, managed suppress growth, reverse growth trends, states see early spike, continued see spike months. U.S., general, handle pandemic: exponential growth reversed, people compliant recommended safety procedures.

The infrastructure personnel that's required respond threat like there, general willingness comply restrictions follow guidelines. proven that. also used point person National Security Council, leading entire federal pandemic response team, current administration decided scratch entire team, [because wasteful spending there's pandemic going on, team brought back quickly, pandemic then, coronavirus emerged, administration decided bring back team, lead, coordinate national response. could done, chose it.

The failure U.S. response coronavirus blamed, fair square, White House. Individual asshats, freaking hell masks, coughing produce aisle, whatever, definitely problem, can't outweigh coordinated, consistent, well-messaged national response. lots crazy people Europe, think COVID, 5G, vaccines, autism Bill Gates *obviously* linked, morons managed ruin counter-measures, position safely re-open borders international travel tomorrow. everything needed, position well, except competent leadership. leaders fucked up, general public. Michigan state well. Definitely would suck see turn around worse. kind want former definitely means latter. I'm industrial hygienist doctor guarantee received significant amount training regards respiratory protection nearly infectious disease control specialist. said know control particulate gasses entering body really know correct body know nothing about.

Masks absolutely work utilized properly. problem utilized properly. Nearly face coverings people patheticly worn people touching removing mask way often. better fit seal better protection factor have.

The real failure government really anyone provided real training education public proper utilization(donning, doffing, proper fit,etc.) mask. suggesting we've seen 2x-4x reduction IFR? so, getting close flu levels? yet think much better smarter conservative cities. 

Fucking disgusting hypocrisy. Harder Daddy! Florida actually done better job protecting risk populations states like New York. Majority infections Florida stupid kids mostly won’t die it. mentioned, probably closer 6 months worth food - supplies. push came shove, I'm positive could leave house Christmas. Hopefully last group bounces several stores giving driving home without groceries. deserve misery.  3 inches wonderful actually refers pillow mattress topper. tried one? Thought everyone everywhere said protesters immune?

Sigh, whatever happens hugs all. Washington state divided half mountain range. Western washington coooler less AC. Eastern washington hot everyone AC.

In Washington virus spread basically flat, except 3 counties slaughterhouse type places. virus spreading rapidly months. Yeah, exactly. 


Yeah climate change bad, hellscape earth 15 years? Yeah, think so. 


I'm worried World War III living climate change hellscape. thats said easy get high horse claim selfish ignorant behavior really consider following:

1. Wearing mask law. There's enforcement masks date. private businesses now, weakly.

2. US rightly wrongly built personal freedom choice. know there's tons abuses history that's I'm saying. 350 million people birth death drilled believe utmost individual liberty. Even leftists US mentality. truth course we're interconnected founders realize fact 1780s. Eastern Western idea around nature self. 

3. may actually unconstitutional mask mandate, I'm sure murky waters fed gov here. 

4. None us US trust institutions lie us self serving. 

5. I've lived US entire life zero concept neighbors community. even know names people houses next me. course care others know. Governor DeWine done fabulous job protecting state. point gave think mistake mandating masks public quite opposite complaints right. Maybe complainers move Florida would seem line way thinking. Africa dealing biblical proportions locusts along Asia eating crops. Mass starvation might expected across globe. That's everyone needs wear them, since know sick people late. imagine number counting like today? Good gravy! loved ones. still say nothing continue wear them, even could've one spread said loved one. soon seated remove mask. places online ordering need interact server. 

Food brought table dropped quickly. Staff available issues pop up, eg: missing item

Other times, server wearing mask, stands bit away side tables usual. “The overall cumulative COVID-19 associated hospitalization rate 4.6 per 100,000, highest rates persons 65 years older (13.8 per 100,000) 50-64 years (7.4 per 100,000).” -CDC

If you’re going dick, don’t wrong. frustrating. can't people understand getting giving others. someone please explain? Jokes EU. didn’t wAnt come anyways...

And keep mean US.. gonna start best friends Russia rule world together... conjecture. likely did. That's science covid19. Good luck actually taking time without getting let go lol No. States don’t ability close borders. NY requiring visitors certain states quarantine get there. again, it’s like big hotel they’re putting 2 weeks...it’s self enforced, know well go n Alot companies flexible. people kids know, start work 10am accommodate later school start schedule. son's school 11am-3:15pm. high school chose take early classes. requirement first period. Also bold assume teaching reading easy. think teachers highly important ages play integral role child's life. think education useless mean people think same. people want kids learn remotely always option. one forces parents take kids person school. teachers willing precautions taken best everyone's ablities believe school return. chance death every time go outside, plan living hole rest life worst 3% chance dying. agree you, maybe someone could infected doesn’t know No, pointed point irrelevant. There’s need look elsewhere solve contrived problem. Okay bud. That's states people refusing wear masks seeing dramatic increases. guess we'll see even lost jobs thousands Americans die. Can't replace lost jobs there's one take I’m social media blackout weekend, don’t even wanna know know celebrating groups/parties. mean point best hope herd immunity... lot people going die people accept it. Makes sense live red state, gov't official say ""If wear mask, gay"" particular bar shut down...did mean bars MI? Define huge. avoiding intubation months. large volume patients percentage require intubation  Thank keeping discourse open honest. news stupid wrong believe wearing mask prevents getting sick. Ideally, yes :) sad thing many people won‘t go see doctor get tested don’t want quarantined. 

There posts Facebook tried stop getting tested. wording like: „More tests mean cases may result lockdown. don’t get tested see doctor fight freedom.“ 

As haven‘t seen happens countries without testing... People stupid selfish... Turner, several friends march also tested positive Coronavirus. Turner says wearing masks.
 
Sure. may infected prior attendance protest, may also point infection others protest. notes others knows subsequently tested positive. mean like ""Federal officials young people: stop spreading COVID-19""? Fellow anxiety sufferers get panic attacks breathing restricted. Upvote comment. need know alone. 



I’m saying masks bad won’t wear one. saying wearing triggers trauma severely. fear driven. look US right now.

It work. need shutdown. measures take fact. 

I need help. do. attempt psychoanalyze someone knowledge think they're wrong. news, Goldman Sachs created new financial instrument allows invest Coronavirus profit pandemic, Coronavirus Debt Obligations (CDO-2) reviewed every 2 weeks EU allow countries similar new cases/risk profiles. 

If you’re asking US specifically imagine ban last minimum 2 months consider US upwards 40,000 new cases day EU 4,000..... countries make unilateral decision simply recommendation, doubt country thinks allowing US citizens good idea moment. governor leader country act like it’s big deal, expect?  even close getting millions would die trying bring about. 

It’s probably dumbest thing could possibly Damn people. stupid party. every Ohioan! Fricken Republicans worst. I'm independent voted DeWine showed could lead. far right people nuts. Refuse wear masks, refuse go crowded bars, restaurants.... messed head. people actually turning Bill Gates.

1995: Liberals hate Bill Gates rich, Microsoft conducts business aggressively, Gates engage much philanthropy.

Gates said time making money time give money away. Right I'm focused making money focus couple things.

THANK U. Good looks real question whether Senate flip. happens, turtle man matters lot less. *where one breath 'cause feels like went got knives chest* Slave, speak Someone pointed me, ty

But would make way first place every year year thing. Hard worry constantly. worry near best prepared. I've driven fire get home commute years back. Oof done 3 months ago actually controlled spread, what's point now? use 3 states control already? pEoPlE dIe CaR aCcIdEnTs CoViD not, news reactionary events actually happened. need spelled you, means sometimes time gaps reporting events happened. yes. initial article read sounded lot like OPs. ""Hey theres respritory disease found. risks pandemic low"". offer $5.00 Taco Bell coupon every time wear mask indoors. 

 placate bunch entitled smug idiots? Anybody still thinks wearing mask help refusing like 'main stream' (non Fox News) media telling helps beyond help. Austin Texas, surrounded sides Texas, however... safe, Austin. Exactly mentality talking about. Simply dismissing countries experience *better*. 

You think countries ran superstitions? medical experts scientists world. Hong Kong accumulated wealth experience due SARS virus medical authorities uncertain terms advises mask wearing. result population 7.5 million, open border China, stopped virus 1000 cases, half actually came expat returning Hong Kong. 

But, hey, know? Ok, fine, please come back call stupid happen first all, factor 10. believe meant 0.2% 

Secodly, rate incorrect. NYC Lombardy around .28% entire populations die COVID already. rate higher even every man/woman, child already infected (hint, been). think, Söder done well crisis, let's forget, also planned invest 700 million euros bavarian space project logo. let's get exited here. takes weeks lot people succumb virus. weeks death numbers jump dramatically. literally whole counties SoCal ignoring mask mandate.  are. chose convince human lives. far Europe okay track record handling plague flush everything toilet. Places definitely self administer tests would highly question accuracy surely somebody sort procedure hundred times day spring going better someone he's first time life Current Covid-19 cases among Florida long-term care residents jumped 1,868, highest level since pandemic began.  increase 293 Covid-19 positive residents since last data Friday, according report released Tuesday Florida Department Health. centers include assisted-living nursing homes. It’s humid lot places. really protect you, though. protects people. Totally, would see as, ""I done best protect family I'm secure that. Sometimes dice roll sucks."" Otherwise, would hard time sleeping night laissez-faire parent think virus real sick kid that.  Killing people millions? think ignored crap masks ineffective time told family lying. Like said, hope wrong. usa banned covid. dickheads plane essential, it’s one way ticket mandatory quarantine

No isn't. *should* be, definitely many states. Woodrow Wilson never even spoke pandemic, thought would distract war effort make US look weak. entirely local communities set guidelines social distancing, business/school shutdowns mask-wearing — major cities set restrictions, plenty places didn’t, coordinated federal response. Anti-Mask League San Francisco. Philly allowed parade go middle pandemic people bored. Sound familiar?

We mostly let burn communities died out. 675,000 Americans died, would equivalent 2.2 million Americans dying 2020.

The current crisis probably won’t get bad, root problems still — system that’s federalized act effectively together crisis, deeply rooted cultural distrust government institutions combined prioritization individual liberties collective good. None things help pandemic. see disaster.

You agreement. Oh that's rich coming CDC. There's credibility anymore since flipped flopped everything virus... know people justified lockdowns time “flatten curve” protect hospitals, point bring number cases level tracked traced. much Europe largely successful far hiccups like Germany’s meatpacking outbreak. Otherwise we’ll see hundreds thousands virus- related deaths day somewhere around 5-10 times many Americans get virus far finally get vaccine. 

Also hospitals still risk overwhelmed fact are. know someone hospital Austin virus terrified hospital run ICU beds. Step 1, everyone masks fuck up. Distance possible, individuals need act responsible protecting public. journalist supported gathering large crowds protest pandemic?? sounds like works better positivity rate low. batches return negative, focus resources positive batches. many batches return positive individual tests needed anyway, significantly reduced number tests. Even fine $1000 still people wearing masks first least two reasons:

1) ignorance 
2) believe actually get caught/be fined think bad wait till hear bad back alot restaurants are. Snow weeks? Blanket warnings would effective. Rather listing every indoor environment churches bars. 

Specifically picking churches mosques etc could taken scapegoating current catastrophe US solely groups. understood nature pandemic viruses misunderstood depth human stupidity. Color shocked [unknown “mild” radioactivity Church everyone. Church congregation people. exempt things banned PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. 7103 today. bit off. People fear everyone get testet, number cases rise again. also fear means another lockdown quarantine rising cases. I‘ve seen posts Facebook try convince people get tested see doctor even symptoms. fear another lockdown pandemic itself. 

Tldr: testing, cases, another lockdown...


Sorry bad English, I‘m Bavarian That's comical total bullshit. video guy trying hold cough funny. think still Good point actually, would like know many asymptomatic vs presymptomatic, either though they’ve proven asymptomatics spread told so, presume chose left position greater good later on.

The entire US government lied repeatedly still lying now. real leaders ones sacrificed principles try work around dysfunctional corrupt, President congress. gaining traction country even friends well. Even people expected year go.  
It's sad world... Give freedom give death! Tyranny! /s don’t get it, OP actual Fauchi? listening howling ""state rights"" certain, right center political party?

I can't imagine missed it. howling going years. mean quite big :). virus naturally disappear 10% population

Every single person infected recover die, I'm sure getting idea.

Don't remember graphics March/April explaining social distancing works? functional enough apolitically imposed social distancing measures financial support citizens successfully slowed contagion now. Everywhere home could include visit next door neighbor. determined ventilators killing crapload people Covid-19? Good old reddit voting truth pushing agenda every second every day. cant open classroom 10 less kids. Every classroom school 12 less. Closer 6 months worth freezer. idea need land - first apartment, BBQ 16sq foot patio. guidance given governor state agencies well. joke, football season continuing unabated far tell. UGA's stadium holds ~90k people tens thousands flock Athens tailgating too. UGA encouraging requiring mask usage, strong Greek life culture means partying go unabated. 

I see disaster. Oh boy... plague rat logic. deserve this. Unfortunately think right. USA 3rd world country goal seek praise approval, making things better people like him. accomplish things without responsible leader (actually job) will... has. Pure value. Good job murica That’s rate pushing don’t believe point don’t want matter percentages lol Alrighty Karen. understand what's going on. constantly switching sides contradicting yourself.

Your 1st 2nd posts contradictory. 1st 3rd post contradictory. Waste time thanks. People look death percentages, forget there’s whole lot misery health death. What's point second third offenses?

Those business owners *willful non-compliance*. business's licence pulled would set example businesses City serious.  social distancing followed. Aw, wanted go Squirty's Moist Mountain weekend. People reddit one track mind comes school closures. go forums like special education even teachers see far better picture. Everyone things kids work home arent cause lazy. dont worry downvotes continue speak void kids sacrificing academically. Agree. outrage, showing indoors vs outdoors Go look retraction put out. “Our luck ran out”? FFS, nothing luck.

“Our resolve ran out” like it. Rite aid pharmacy grocery lie items it. Similar Walgreens CVS. book? Actually yes, you’re right. came case spike began may good comparison 4th us. Reading article 4 weeks ago (around Eid) sounds exactly like situation today: Ohhhhh nooooooooo. That's meant! Lol first part gonna lie comprendo. Ya seems hard social distance lunchroom hallways hard social distance Answer: don’t. name like this, must Danish. True false? opinion early stage public health message ""average citizens, wear masks work"", apparently intention fact ""masks work extremely short supply, please save medical workers""? would phrase message position time? co-worker discussion yesterday. Democrat president proposed kind stimulus? one Republican would supported it.  lumped Brazil Russia. Let sink minute - federal government literally power. 

Only states do, that's even guess long work. 

Let's honest, may never vaccine might rip bandaid off. contrary, trust authorities unquestioningly. ""If masks lockdowns implemented early adhered everyone world multiple months"" accurate statement. California India locked early, what's happening now?

It's galaxy brain thinking say everyone right thing time would problems. STDs would exist people wore condoms time. issue humans perfect. governments (thankfully) cannot control mandate human behaviours, especially short period time behaviours core existence social animal like humans. 

It's irresponsible fantasist governments formulate pandemic response around assumption people accept serious restrictions daily life unspecified amount time, large growing personal economic cost. Poor guy never got last meal anything else fatigue? I'm skeptical I'm missing common symptoms like cough fever. good amount parents going send kids school. risk high measures going enough. say say control open everything up. course bound happen. science community saying open early. That's ridiculous! exploit exactly? Bill Gates designed product solved real problem went build successful company. compensated accordingly. would want compensated well instead making something talk shit successful people Reddit. 2 teenagers tech savvy. really struggled online learning. students gifted program. teacher told 30% kids turned assignments gifted program middle class school district. much worse inner-city kids kids struggle read? 

College siphons best brightest. People choose online college learn well way. class failed college one tried take online. learn well way. Every building HVAC system good filters. systems, ducts high-velocity, air spends less minute duct system. Whatever air return grille, still air outlet, unless filtered out. droplets aerosols air, pass right system.

Placement return grills also needs attention. return grill creates negative pressure zone, capture whatever air near location. restaurant could put return grill table, droplet aerosols seated customers would captured instead floating tables.  Let's include it! Almost 800 deaths, 8000 cases, worldwide. even got SARS-CoV-2 vaccine it. isolated eliminated. What's point? Sorry didn’t read edit probably sounded like douche. Disgusted state live tbh. wait relocate. Glad got tf saying thats right thing wrong thing lab researching highly contagious, pandemic like viruses ***in 2015*** evident paper. 4+ years studying didn’t jack crap stop hell we’ve currently witnessed 2020 due COVID-19.

Not saying play another pandemic, definitely gonna say it’s tad naive think know there’s little danger outbreak road. No, it’s trump admin told people **truth** FFS. told people potential implications survival instead saying young people cautious solely sake protecting elderly. Wrong, young people suffer damaged lungs coronavirus actually attacks lower respiratory tract unlike flu Cheers bud, stay safe thanks candor advice. PA too. We're reopening now, we've actually gotten rates decently low I'm angry. still wear mask can. led uv-c buy mercury vapou

they've research lab rats 5 years know of. hairless rats. expose large amounts far uv radiation weekly/monthly checkups skin eyes. yet show negative results. never would warned really putting 5G. 

/s (I hate feel like need add this) story infuriating. I'm sure, he's sorry yet, he'll sorry. people, ""I live fear I'll anyway"" people who, like humans, make mistakes. Yeah, messed up, many ""I made mistake, I'm sorry"" going deal with? implications pandemic, one that's spreading spreading, people understand? requires war-time effort, citizens compliance. American, confirm sentiment. Agreed. 200 years fight oppression. Picked pandemic? Fuck wait Six months ago December, January February. 55-60k seems likely Friday. Waivers hard enforce, unless Fat Man, rafts lawyers delay bankrupt plaintiffs. cleaned spray paint tiny dick tank. you, friend.  Agreed, also think less dense population really helpful world ending. re-categorized food millenials. home town im glad Mayor Turner said georigia florida 2 months ago. said Wisconsin immedietly opened up. 

Cases going theyre finally testing everyone. need hospitalization im skeptical on, theres money made admitting people Corona even put ventilator liberate Kansas next? good news? time workers sacrificed profit again. guess drew short straws. Disproportionately. like us got short straws got long ones. I’m starting understand gyms bad.

The research showing asymptomatic people actually lung issues, enough impact day day activities. symptoms. issues seen CT scans.

So healthy runner COVID doesn’t know it, gets treadmill runs three miles. Maybe feels Imagine viral load person putting out. 25-30 minutes - surrounded others cardio equipment breathing deeply. bought clothes weekly? big closet?

I buy clothes rarely need to, rather large closet already full. Much stuff quite fit well used (my weight cycles part fitness routine) thus get worn, still... 

I hope least buying cheaper stuff. can't stand markups really high-end clothes anymore, unless something really properly nice. Ever since learned sew (I get really Halloween), either buy good stuff expensive, buy stuff really shows craftsmanship way think myself.

If looking $200+ per shirt, get better value quality local designer make something bespoke you. supporting real local craftsman/craftswoman. applies men's stuff women's though. seems like wife murdering husband.

But mindset stands. Right believe would better served campaign month two risk protected best could virus allowed run rest. countries heading anyway .. might well without also wrecking economy.

Ah, see listen Swedish Death Metal population density gives advantage, (relative) wealth citizens. New Zealand go deep lockdown much comfortably average mixed-income country. Holy crap. That’s extreme feels like can’t true. I’m sure is. 
Why isn’t federal government state helping ? Aren’t far enough know needs done ?? serials captured pull footage bought pull parking footage get plate run plate. get knuckleheads, bars take blame too? supposed limiting number patrons. Ref: - point, wearing Mask public IQ test.. What's easy conclude difficult depend industries income. similar swine flu appears soon might able squash even gets traction. Much lower R0 (1.5ish) average 2 days incubation. current social distancing, mask wearing, less people traveling, would tough kind virus spread significantly. It’s possible virus contagious mutate fast, become less fatal. Hopefully deaths stay low find death rate thing similar flu worse symptoms. 

There’s reason whole (worldwide) media shifted deaths cases.. I'd rather let share me. I've always hunch drug epidemics symptom miserable society become cause it. 

Very hard thing prove, may stay belief me. lame, especially deep everyone knows traced anyway. admit actually use something helpful going far apparently. You’re forgetting potential long-term complications like permanent lung scarring, blood clots, loss smell/taste, etc. Focusing mortality rate short-sighted. UV-C light creates toxic gas. presents major hurdle using it.

only ozone producing UVC lamps create toxic gas use. different story break lamp use, since contain mercury. well work landlords go bankrupt loose properties. difference Chinese trust leadership make good decisions.

More like Chinese trust version Fauci Scientists media. Meanwhile, divided media US, anti-intellectuism conspiracy theories exposed ridiculed places.  much easier people agree virus real threat need lock homes wear mask outside homes. Omg needed life. we’re going ignore SARS then? they’ve like entire time. aren’t distractions (sports, tv/movies, etc) right people taking notice. action words elizabeta  deaths always lag behind cases. That's virus works. get postive test die. Haha, fair enough. time someone mentions Jersey Shore automatically picture Wildwood Seaside Heights circa 2005. I'm said 'DTS' meant Wildwood that's exactly picture. happy never step foot NJ though. 10 days ago told wait 14 days see deaths go up, surprised seen deaths go up?

Let's meet back middle July, check daily death numbers. mean, like 4 days since spike REALLY took off, would say give another week two assuming something fundamentally changed here. deaths still 1000 per day 2 weeks, become hopeful either virus changed, treatments gotten lot better, old people risk everything right order get it. Twitch memes, 5head person wants people think great idea (upgrade forehead, 4head), bigbrain goes back Markiplier concept.

Rampmaster waterlord pretty obvious about. guy known months Russia paying bounties murder American soldiers. burden disproportionately ""essential workers"" millions dead big deal butt hurt made billions using exploitation monopolization? profits slavery used resource products?

Nah.

I'm irate find strange pro slave. still people faith country without competent president? think speak us say motherfuck Yea money back it. Yay taxes... (im cali) unemployment problem solved following days, let’s hypoxia games begins! /s denotes sarcasm, good man/woman. everyone take test beforehand quarantine trip. 

The tests pretty reliable now. antibody tests much less so. I’m that, work north live East Dallas seen little less half, businesses definitely requiring them. Maybe places, none happened go to. racist genocide guy UK WW2? COULD HAPPENED sleep care. DEMAND CHICKEN TACO even could make home half price Unfortunately get worse gets better.  Ignore everyone else playing everything.  Remember throughout history people havent ideal lifes.  People turned 30 1918 pandemic,the great depression, wwi wwii fucked decade thats short window history. Fuck many people lived throw events. 

We likely hit depression idea looks like know bad.  Save save save 

Better prepared wrong.  Im super hopeful gets better walk solid savings thats best case scenario. maybe president really hard, decisions blowback sometimes can’t begin imagine. could always whatever Trump does, try imagine consequences actions, live moment. Dude dumb fuck someone explain finding majority cases coming from? targeting activities ? still understand spreading fast considering really gather en mass. Growing smaller daily FL one closed right Disney World...Legoland open. Though it’s nice gesture counselor I’m sure it’s wisest move make given things spiking FL right lifelong Kansas resident, glad issued already see many people throwing temper tantrums muh freedom. mean it’s pretty much proven little bit dangerous flu, unless you’re 65 pre existing health conditions. case, even flu would kill you.

ABSOFUKINLUTLY! think family would learn lot means good citizen People Twitter say that's nobody's going tests nobody feels sick. point taken. launching massive ""Asymptomatic Carrier"" screening campaign. 

...but time looks like they're still problems processing samples timely fashion. 

All reason people wear masks public transit :) goes ""it's incompetent political leader"" theory. L.A. super aggressive almost day one, CA. Way states past peaks fine. Fair enough, hope Duval sets precedent sad part countries genuinely tried control pandemic. everything book, locked early cases still going up. obvious .. social distancing many parts world impossible. Telling rich westerners stay home one thing, safety net. try tell poor Nigerian Ecuatorian cannot go work feed family .. guess what? tell jump nearest lake.  
 
If Western countries mobilized supported poorer countries might chance. Right believe would better served campaign month two risk protected best could virus allowed run rest. countries heading anyway .. might well without also wrecking economy. work place example cited Erin Bromage post? know one? winter, assume heat on. ended spreading lot people floor infected person, think. infected person breathing 8.5+/- hours, bets off? go back office next week, I’m worried say least. One ladies came back vacation beach Delaware (Dewey Rehoboth, can’t remember which), people think quarantining two weeks. H1N1 2009, horrible. I’m sorry loss. Oh God China why. Source? understate it, number deaths per day AZ continues low - like 20-some. 

I guess next weeks indicate true impact upswing. could predicted president would turn wearing mask new maga hat.  little late. So? Neither wearing seatbelt drive. still right? way it, yes.

I decline anything else you. finished 4 weeks building back strength started lifting heavy today. Rip gainz. No. would say so? worries me. We're going open bars next week UK, cant social distance properly supermarkets I'm sure we'll fine opening bastions common sense morality people discuss ideas freely danger tempers flaring. certainly good news dont think we're absolutely fucking decision all, even little bit.

WE'RE ALLLL DOOOOOOMED! Thanks taking time respond! really appreciate it! read again, it’s dude. lying. TON tourists NY PA come beach summer love get rowdy drink. Example - Jersey Shore TV show... fully open state gathering limits mask requirements low mask adoption. 

We able WFH since March. kids homeschooled pulled person activities since March. 

I mostly go store us, still try keep week. also visited book stores library low crowd times masks kids. 

Most entertainment parks/fishing/kayaking - things lockdown well. able take kids playgrounds times one else there. 

We get take occasionally resuming person dining. Also limits movie theaters, crowded stores, unfortunately public pool daughter’s dance class (she’s still young I’ve home home version now.) doubt lol find 100 articles people complaining couldnt get tested march Carry wayward son That's felt Christie sandy. like guy great job us time part California u live in? two friends like you......and administration says teachers come work Sept. do?? Get fired take disability?? union here. number people thinking mask necessary directly proportional death-related panic. First, one worried, believed CDC (when CDC basically saying worry wasn’t shortage masks doctors), everyone panicked bought masks, everyone pretending rona gone they’ve changed mind again.

In week four everyone back freaking masks again.

People believe convenient believe, large. I'm sure anyone involved ever could under-estimate human stupidity. Thanks! TIL! really mad see much hep c drug sovaldi goes lol.  month get out? need pressure Venezuela? audacity always tell them. would better would certainly better stayed business. want install hand picked stooge name ""freedom""?

But can't provide 5 6 different plates, serve hot once. can't provide nice ambience good service friends without break away conversation tend food. service restaurants thrive providing, usually main reason like going them.

Our school giving us opportunity online provide every student Chromebook. trying take away credit NY, us NJ as, better. 45 new cases less 400 last 8 days. got hit massively hard like NY did, reacted faster. People like make fun NJ, we're amazing. like NY CT. Everyone needs follow suit gets worse them. Well scares shit me. tested past Saturday CVS. claim zero this.... scares me.

You underestimate human stupidity carelessness agree [You start fact what’s implemented city Ontario, Canada company work going ham things right it’s disgusting. fact checking whatsoever, pure emotional “BE CAREFUL” selling. biggest shucksters know peddling cure everything wrong hvac, say least I’m skeptical. I’d love see actual verifiable real world data regarding uv HVAC systems killing airborne viruses buildings, I’m expecting ever much.  Need curbside b&amp;m (or delivery possible) Actual mortality rate slowly decreasing since middle May much testing June. cases identified = lower deaths per case. said expect deaths per case start plateau July. 80% us live areas weeks carelessness away hotspots. great news! New Zealand couldn’t let one flight land without letting infected people country, nationals. 

Germany’s meatpacking industry saw outbreaks even though ostensibly they’ve kept things control. american either? Cool saying gatherings smart (they obviously weren't), actions might inadvertently help NJ's numbers long run. seems indoor spread main culprit increased cases, delay indoor reopening might prevent surge. 

I would really interested see would happen cases area opened outdoor activities, including bars, restricted everything indoors. would obviously done warm weather months. hospitals starting suffer. 

I really hope deaths stay low, though. I'm hopeful due better therapeutics, lower average age infected. danger younger people infected easier older people trying take precautions catch it, I'm hoping mostly stick within young healthy.

As things covid, seems annoying 'wait see' holding pattern weeks. surprised good J lmao Gilead Sciences Inc... so... that's name Mike Pence's America Handmaids Tale. Coincidence?

Witness meeeeeee Yeah, thousands people packed limited spaces recycled air, prisons going hotspots matter what. 

I lived dorm like room 45 guys ordinary cold hit like 43 us. Despite people may think medical services nominal. get cold lucky get Benadryl. Prisons nearly zero equipped pandemic. opened summer workout camps high school couple weeks ago, now, bunch shutting down. outdoor summer workout can't last long, classes resume? didn’t even knew closed? Oh no. sounds like Trump. great, thought better this. 

I'd personally attribute number many people disease. teach high school California. I’ve accepted fact going back school sites August.... parents babysitting (free childcare), go work. one saying it, isn’t solely education. 

It joke lessons made person, well online versions students won’t aren’t allowed come school day.

Right now, nationally 20% parents want online option children. knows number August. take one kid testing positive teacher, shut things down.

If students wear masks, won’t take long dominos fall. Students won’t want looked oddly, slowly become less less wearing them. Doesn’t matter think useful not... give students reason wear see peers it.

Looking forward shit show fall. 🙄😅 whole thing interesting study viral spread *DISinformation.* It’s ok, “the free shit” generation say whatever want regardless offensive is. 

You know agreeing taking debt partying every weekend vs literally chains someone else’s property pretty much thing. 

I looked exact years millennials according google I’m actually one lol. ""The way things actually work"" eventually catches people.

The scientific community likes get head start trying figure things work ahead time, thus potentially avoiding least mitigating bad things.

People big fans using science whatever ""feels"" right, find experience good idea not. tend come around, eventually, typically various bad things happen. studies many years this. last 5 years skin eye tests 222nm. this, tests many years 207nm. non ozone producing variant. migrated 207nm 222nm 222nm found effective breaking RNA viruses DNA bacteria. tests 222nm skin/eye damage ongoing Columbia university taking weekly monthly checks hairless rats continually exposed 222nm radiation yet find damage caused it. faceless pharma bro action. I'm contradicting you, link study? I'm actually interested reading it. shut travel country January probably could gotten control like New Zealand. Instead, shut travel China February, completely ignoring virus brought Europe. I'm sure they'll re-assess, starting point. Based saw Arizona previously, bet they'll re-open 30 days though, spite still cases per day re-opened last time probably, they'll show much higher peak, far come peak, say they've flattened curve, hurray! declare victory everyone go bars restaurants gyms without masks... Rinse, repeat. amazingly hilarious. Looks like wiki changed still see google. left though. people need exposed inglorious bastards style. even understand people ARE. Like, know better, right? wouldnt want non-mask non-social distancer anyway DC that. Get here. sure California, since Friday, Facemasks NC mandatory. Unfortunately still see people enter various shops (signs clearly door) ""masks required"" without wearing masks getting came (no refusal service)
 screwing virus continue thrive thanks stupid people fear. Lol fuck bot name couple ?  Start spreading news... bamp bamp ... bamp bamp bamp.... Martin...you want close beaches? Spend less time No, think I'm making obvious gaping hole u/guynpdx's ""logic"". False. stated masks required time. American politicians reiterated told. fuck bars even open? beyond ridiculous. it’s money lives, people get board. Dude, let's wear masks, instead getting Mars.  TIME! 

Looks like....(checks stopwatch)... 6 months!

Fuck “hyper-competitive”, ivy-league, great-recessing coke heads. Fucking morons. 

Mike pence beat mask jeopardy. lot families older kids and/or live family members. example, teenagers watch younger kids parent work. ""Let speak manager family market."" really absolutely...more like whispering dangers. Maybe warned COVID pandemic weeks sooner, instead week Italy went national lockdown, things would turned better western nations. World’s greatest country world’s biggest morons ironically.  realise lung scarring, thing virus definitely caused, permanently decreases lung capacity, right? 

Jesus know ***literally anything*** biology? Yea, foolishly (so I) expected competent response. 164/186 (88%) hospitalized. great odds.... all. Awesome. That's right. still think dumb, totally free make mind. literally don’t understand people break downs wear mask.

somehow, past 30 years, people re-interpreted word ""freedom"" effectively ""selfishness"" Someone whose educated science lose faith science. Mask wearing politicized unfortunately fact people opposed safety belts cars they’re quite effective reducing amount times deadly crash deadly versus survivable. type protections talking about. 

Honestly though, it’s wearing mask getting work live life, economy close reopen close repeat, feel like asking people wear masks get past crap isn’t big ask. 

But again, it’s politicized backing anti-mask policy standpoint would wise huge, big moment happens. sure would basically, needs something allows say, course wearing masks now, never said shouldn’t, right decide. 

But I’m holding breath moment. I’m staying public areas avoiding close quarters inside. I’ve 3 buildings last two three months now. I’ll keep way long possible Source? Also unfortunately, amount info sway brain dead among us  truly believe that? purpose earth without intelligent self aware sentient beings?

If extinct humans one day earth going faced problem nobody's going able help Earth intelligence beings planet.

For example asteroid could wipe entire planet kill every living thing it. 

We technologically advancing civilization potential ability prevent asteroid impact save earth.

Yeah we're perfect yet things might look like suck. time time throughout history human race persevered. we'll again. Things look dark right always way.

And kids sure-fired way prevent change.

The people changing upper governments upper 60s 70s 80s...

The biggest contributor causing change mass quantities people agreeing change. produce child that's one less person pushing change.

I'm extinction human race all. I'm advancement human race change.

We put man moon. launched car space. We've landed rovers asteroids. We've built processor mere 30 years hundreds thousands times powerful one 30 years ago.

I want raise children help change world one piece time. I'm going roll give up. give nature. agree missing point. Americans never think like literally founding principles raised. going bad people undo programming. even struggled lockdown trivial things. Yeah, guidelines reduce risk infection. It’s reduce risk, slow spread. think everyone that’s infected walking around like bunch careless morons? water currently 90-F southern florida. But...on hand, American politicians cannot tell American people do...freedom all. People act like private companies bureaucracy incompetence level government haha. [archive link anyone trouble accessing information ](http://archive.is/T40Ka) general Shitty scum bag shitty scumbag. gullible idiots gullible idiots Also, lot nicer, superficial level least, going around thinking nothing bad going happen family hoax.

Anyway, point pandemic way good economy 'overpopulated' poor estates. There’s lot quick dismissals protests prominent cause spread. don’t think timing coincidence neither fact sources denying impact we’re largely supportive time. Peiple hate admitting wrong almost much hate brutality. Frankly population selfish way is, really hope health experts continue emphasize personal protective aspects mask wearing. 

Over 50% nation seem give damn helping others. lol shit. point poor medical science professionals ran options reaching morons wear piece cloth literally PROTECT DYING alone hooked machines. Like alone enough make people want listen. Luck? rely luck, screwed. Next time, try relying science facts. see sub shit America day really wish “we finding cases” “everyone catching this.”

It's perfect number, percentage people testing virus order magnitude higher California in, say, Germany, testing similar rate per capita basis. Use google, fool. 

Also look rates pneumonia deaths. three four times normally winter, it’s goddamn summertime! math, genius... lied country it’s leadership FACTS disease well known world. Demanding ignorant ass gets educated Reddit redditors who’ve done research like everyone else demanding sources affirmations explanations enough asinine... go find sources, lazy little shit. Thugs area playing fireworks every night past week Yup, I’m 100% agreement there. Bars general seem also really attract “pandemic over” crowd absolute jack crap protect virus...indoors, masks, social distancing go right back world spread long though? One month expanded unemployment runs out. 1 months, 20,000,000 people go put danger trying find jobs. able find take jobs paying less money likely putting exposure. Well expected least exploding like last week Hmm...maybe Americans start drawing arms trying shoot virus death? one cares nurse. care making inaccurate low-effort comments. thing is, really new information. already knew SARS respiratory viruses generally transmit. Remember hysterics find N95 masks hospital staff? think might known without them, hospital staff would likely get sick? shoot him?

A) wearing mask, felt threatened.

B) wearing mask, felt threatened. there's way plan around multiple tacnukes/ICBMs/SLBMs hitting every population center that's tiny village top chemical biological weapons going down, almost half tests. move numbers we're 71k tests would almost 10k positive. Yes. That’s precisely point. beneficial general thing basically vaccine coronavirus, closer he's pushing. psychological study conducted logical reason wearing mask/covering face public. ""too hard breathe, wahhh"" wear cloth scarf something, put people ease. wrong, hot spot seems determined 14 day case trends. go 1 case 4 cases rural NorCal that's much terms relative % increase 300 450 Riverside. would say misinterpretation data, like comparing sub 1mil country's covid19 cases 10mil+ countries.

Then looking cases death per capita, concerning whole course pandemic. we're seeing trend increases cases hospitalization LA Riverside/San Bern counties past weeks. saddest part average citizen even know/care lack privacy. gleefully download silly games/apps track purchases/activity apps free... Hey there, approved recent post :) I’ll removing one. Thank Think dumb is, Prez put mask encourage others so, could save thousands lives, easy thing do. It’s almost like he’s destroying America purpose Well people argued lockdowns expecting that? models enforce mask usage across whole population indoor environments, even transmission virus low back people's minds? point examples country done masks even similar public health initiative?

I understand immense frustration people wear masks, problem much bigger that. increased. Yesterday also 41k tests 5,266 new cases. Today also 41k tests 6,093. Previous days 70k tests. Yamcha? bet work actually, several letters. think need end sentence full stop quote, otherwise might look like continuation sentence. certain though.

I'd put full stop outside quote. I'd probably drop trailing full stop inside quote, quoted text one, unless multiple sentences. According European Commission, UK nationals still treated way EU citizens end Brexit transition period (31.12.2020).

Thank EC Looks like curve flattened! combination populace care higher education. I've heard plenty people rant worthless higher education is. Wednesday-Saturday biggest days

So sad happy 6k new cases Well guys it, corona more, guy want ain't gonna happen anymore. forgot say thank day comment! molte grazie! usual insightful agree assessment entirely. positive percentage 71k tests compared today? Yes, authorities kept saying plenty beds available field hospital Stockholm never used. 

Meanwhile average age ICU patients kept going survival rate rose world leading 80% ... words - patients didn’t get admitted ICU chance survival judged less 80%  Knowing Goldman works, time released they're telling mask manufacturers they'll supply funding 10% interest production.  ""Wearing face masks public 95% time could save 30,000 lives"" - Bernie Sanders. desensitized numbers anymore.

Seoul, capital S. Korea, provides free COVID-19 tests Seoul residents without symptoms.

- first-come-first-serve basis

- limited per person

- weekly cap 1,000 persons

- samples 5~10 indivisuals pooled tested together.  if result positive, samples tested individually.

Not applying test program above, may still receive test even without symptoms recommendation note doctor. test result comes back negative, pay test fee (about $133.) people sub need realize there's outbreak raw new cases. That's LOT positives, definitely reassuring.

Hospitals beginning fill too... Right, science real 😁 went enlightened genius pizza cutter one comment: edge point. holy fuck one retarded comment made there. says “we” discussing precautions pretty sure they’re lockdown, negative. think it’s like 5%

Depends area I’d comfortable estimating &lt;3% wearing masks consistently city area. I’ve seen store myself, one customer one worker. Stores full always, restaurants. 

In states like OK it’s definitely majority refuse wear. Especially men, it’s seen feminine wear mask. It’s surprise really, attitudes apply little shit like umbrellas, protective eyewear, even safeties power tools etc. Nearly everywhere I’ve worked disables safety mechanisms doesn’t enforce protective gear, OSHA damned. 

In culture like masks never stood chance. think depends live. one point, stats 50/50 Britain, 20/80 US. seems depend heavily quality availability health care. [Pediatricians think kids I’ll take word yours. Thanks comment. I'm low key hoping keep idiot brother planning wedding August gets plans thwarted. asshole told chill wait pandemic maybe, chose August would provide ""the best time go honeymoon"" AZ. Call really want enjoy that. Hell yeah brother! get fine. Bet saying visited actual third world country Whether protests cause new outbreaks almost important. matters strong impression received loud clear people protest OK go now. incidentally, expert health officials hypocritical. would break bit differently. think two phases mask skepticism/resistance/whatever want call it.

I think first phase based legitimate scientific uncertainties transmission disease effectiveness masks. clear earlier studies masks (excluding N95 better) little nothing prevent catching respiratory infection. also uncertain degree asymptomatic, presymptomatic pauci-symptomatic individuals spread disease, even whether getting individuals wear masks household community settings would make much difference given available studies, relatively low quality.

What clear significant shortage types PPE, used properly hospital setting, medical masks respirators essential infection control. made seem irresponsible recommend masks general population, given uncertainty upside real clear downsides recommendation. That's get Fauci telling people wear masks.

But then, somehow, became culture war issue. know understand started, result red tribe began seeing masks invasion personal freedom reason, blue tribe began seeing important measure controlling pandemic. since anything promoted side assumed wrong default current political climate, positions become increasingly entrenched extreme time.

This led current situation one side objects masks seemingly stupid reasons, side promotes far beyond scientific evidence suggests importance (from read, social distancing least 1 meter/3 feet seems effective measure, handwashing avoiding large crowds next). course masks likely help hurt, ability control pandemic going hinge universal masking, seen news stories people kicked stores getting close cashier refusing use hand sanitizer.

TL;DR: conclusion resistance started legitimate scientific debate since turned political issue, currently guarantees one side going strongly favor strongly against. like Spain, Italy, **UK** properly quarantined, **wore masks**

Uk wearing masks all. requirement mask public transport hardly enforced. Well. agreement consent.. call police get arrested. let punch face. contract. waiver. Consent. cop say. told would let punch face press charges coughing him. can't breech contract sorry. can't nothing.

It's lag that. take weeks doctor fill death certificate, getting death adjudicated state added official tally.

All person dies shows numbers. never answer phone know Number. entirely Telemarketers.  Thanks, we’re cured.  Covid loves 'Murca best! ssoooo helpful happy make work dead easy.

Emphasis word dead! Projection. 

I’m complete agreement you, call everyone snowflakes cucks emasculate, turn around cry mean people president. president ever subjected much criticism...

What holy fuck talking about? Unemployment rate highest since Depression; pandemic sweeping country, killing 130,000 people; response government. Race riots egged tweeting ‘white power’. 

Criticism isn’t even enough. needs dragged White House jailed. ....despite simultaneously majority people staying inside  think care print trillion dollar go wanted? lines...""Fuck it!

Getting masks universally accepted thing going take bit. hope limited mandatory mask order public transport lead larger uptake. Ah Goldman Sachs board, anyone wanna lock bet mango changes tune now? ""I love police state""

 Go move fucking Ukraine Every time read article one incorrect statements, journalist simply ignored qualifiers made headline. 

E.g. mentioned below, WHO: ""there empirical evidence masks affect spread"", news: ""masks affect spread!"". two different statements.

Unrelated similar phenomenon, South Korea: ""our government's position KJU alive"", news: ""South Korea confirms KJU alive"".

I'm sure they've incorrect information, always check direct quotes nowadays. biggest problem expanding hospital capacity populace recent years. 30 years ago K-12, hospitals today beds.

That insane considering much populace grown. real reason want wear masks want inconvenienced. justification give besides trying sound astonishingly selfish. New York resident, I’m happy get sense pandemics hit based world’s vulnerable to. Bubonic Plague deadly back people didn’t understand hygiene. Spanish Flu killed young soldiers going war. virus that’s comparatively mild, society interconnected it’s bound infect countless people kill whoever can. It’s probably going depend health covid too. family friend pass it, ICU 11 days ventilator. morbidly obese health issues too. one first covid deaths area well. Exactly, racism would imagined. reason pick guy racism. doing: test leave, test come also 14 days full itinerary disclosure, public transport. Business people :/

As be. commute subway Tokyo every day I'm pushed people, take much cause massive issue. time travelling. um yeah new H1N1 discovered yesterday coming....so.....yeah.... Yeah mostly lay stomachs now, try release much pressure lungs can. Right populism pandemic. Superspreaders special, important everyone else. like ventilator, masks almost nothing help decrease chances dying covid Nope. realist.  America one shit-hole countries certain person likes refer to.

Tbf he's criticized Sweden army lending help well. can't win I’m shocked uneducated Americans believe non scientific crap Hey buddy... Calm down. dish can't take it.

The state specifically let Disneyland reopen yet. Sorry, don’t believe blaming people wanting live life problem. Become homeless don’t consume makes sense. Stop consuming live grid don’t feed rich people. viable solution. reason can’t implement taxes quite European countries help lift people poverty. Instead people blaming poor people happy homeless daring go Walmart instead blaming government rich people. Except NYC, Bay Area, Minneapolis 

Florida, Arizona South Carolina big increase cases.

I don’t think much evidence Houston protests vs wearing masks inside. People get infected infect others infect others exponential rise happen need provide smaller crowds virus infect. tested last week haven’t received results yet. site full 9 AM. know others tested elsewhere day wait massive lines too. We’re going huge results day coming point next two weeks whenever tests get reported. logic fauci used didn’t recommend face masks. 

Covering facts push narrative never ok. That's different plan. Hard lockdown contract tracing different. means Aug 15th next phase ""over"". large loss privacy, travel restrictions restrictions. kind mistake aggressive responses. silly. ~~aliens~~ angels. Civil engineering angels. sound like miserable person exactly. teamwork. Thus fights supermarkets Karen walks mask says breathing problem. Karen, stay home order delivery wear mask, mask people you. people dont wanna sacrifice. 

at least comes something demands larger sacrifice typical one what? follow rules. Smile nod. run away first opportunity. Testing sites definitely saturated, day-long waits.  Gus Gus! Darwinism could impact environmental factor way aware of... there's law universe says every threat one faces fair.

But literally explaining virology people telling communal mask wearing help protect everyone transmitting / acquiring known, deadly virus, still take perform simple, life-saving behavior. mind-boggling. Aww jealousy . Good luck uneducated troll see Europe already started planning next outbreak. Yes.

The closest ever got spitting customer's food even worst thing happened day. restaurant attracted worst, entitled people. insulted, snapped whistled at, screamed at, etc. thing pushed edge simple eye roll. rage every inconsiderate, arrogant customer ever served bubbled surface. stared soup full two minutes, imagining hocking huge loogie it. decided worth losing job go it, could done felt zero guilt. Much better above.  contrary, someone who's educated science would constantly facepalming often scientific experts push data *know* faulty gain. would understand often studies funded people special interests - even scientists trying unbiased, they're still chosen *because already agree person funding research*. would *extremely* alarmed much current research replicated, much cannot replicated someone finally tries.

Scientific authority abused public trust, mostly corporate political interests *want* abuse public trust. finally coming home roost, fucking us. fair, lots people Virginia even followed Northam's mask order point hes probably like fuck it, lets open show happens. Tell r/Conservative wrong all. parts Florida get looked crazy wearing mask LOL. I’ve feeling. Glad elderly relatives died recently aren’t hunting obese diabetics. Yeah, ventilators causing deaths nurse doctor told me. mean assist Florida holding convention there. generous. bring millions jobs, millions. Lots people sending thanks. still haven’t found way feel like I’m going pass within 5 minutes. doubt really what's happening, governor's parrot Mango says would hard willfully negligent across board doctors labs. 

I'd guess overloaded labs/testing sites. 

Comment got removed using different food based reference..lol JULY we’re mandating masks!!?! open bars ,then get mad people went bars... Open up, fill up, seal up, check back one month. Agreed, state new lockdown. need write letters congresspeople economical effective version. advise do? live riverside county. People parties area weekend. past capacity soon. disaster. California big state though issue people fight science fight sort logic. people listen science sort knock ass make listen. 

Living AZ nightmare. honestly thought okay one point held 10k quarantine. month later we're 60k rising. mean comes back? gone anywhere. Yer president's bawbag. heck open first place still?!!! True topic. took much longer days, instances popping January, cases already underway February. states even close April exception few. know really hillarious sad way trying much worry economy. ended rushing prolong virus much longer needed making even devastating could been. Meanwhile states rush worry people states bringing back. gave us way much credit common sense self-restraint. Protesters tended wear masks safer bars. Also way people Phoenix bars protests. How? find incubation period asymptomatic nature much later hit critical mass. Japan realize everyone thought Japan would suffer greatly due much older population top delaying action save Olympics, thanks mask. China Wuhan, eventually physically separated anyone tested positive virus general population including mild symptoms ran course. countries started voluntary quarantine often breached. Happy live Connecticut right (never thought id say that) atleast governor taking serious. conspiracy theorists exist, always them. damn many now. many holding office. part constitution prevents states enforcing it? nearly impossible staff field hospitals outside region crisis everyone crisis real close weeds too. ""Chain"" ? Hugo's like two locations. Yes kind complete garbage idiot would even consider attaching stigma wearing mask middle pandemic? Scientist roll call??
I’m literally going crazy whole thing...data, numbers, behavior, politics... 401k disappear fast stock market investment. me, seems question if, when. invested bubble, ourselves. Plenty countries shown possible contain virus without getting hit hard. also likely immunity lasts months, better hope possible never get rid virus. would seem half humanity insist stick hoax really threat, even bludgeons death. Gates Buffet pledged ""vast majority wealth"" ""99%"" respectively charity life death. addition, encouraged hundreds billionaires pledge half wealth, including Mrs. cool hate Bezos, though. significant inequality poverty here. Amongst worst OECD. worked number foodbanks across Auckland, largest city, lockdown need sadly huge. Canada country seem prone politicising everything America is. Like turned mask wearing politics. turned covid economic issue. Thank much. Yeah pretty much. key thing imo discourage gatherings, close indoor activities like bowling alleys, arcades, places worship enforce masks. Another SIP would hurt businesses imo absolutely last resort effective economic harm good since us want stay safe spending lot time home still. Plague rat logic.

Every little bit helps. Restaurants closed, open mean masks worn two wrongs dont make right.

Seriously, preschool/kindergarten stuff. Bye loony boy. Btw problem. Good job! nursing homes need restructured operated... damn least, real god damn oversight. cities population 11 million people, sometimes people collapse street. I'm sure many could connected covid, let's forget happens anyway, surprising regularity. really needed laugh, thank Sure, kids going fix that. leaving house four months surely helping that.

To many people kids kids. people kids choosing them.

That contributes problem makes things astronomically worse.

The problem we're reproducing much. right people reproducing.

I feel morale obligation raise kids help, kids lighting shit fire methed parents home. *Louisiana feels left joins too* hope ok Wow would assumed Pennsylvania would way, way cases/deaths then. think cases per capita Florida everyone required wear masks since April? crap part gym enforcing masks. order governor, masks supposed worn social distancing limited even though phase 4, Chicago made masks mandatory places like gyms lowered capacity IL guideline 50% 25%. Many IL/Chicago residents frustrated amount people lowering guards wearing masks anymore. businesses don’t enforce rules, makes harder us. Evidence Georgia hiding deaths GTF Americans, absolutely are, better worse.  you, don’t mind asking? I’m Austin, TX people seemed adherent common sense safety protocols far, I’m thankful for. mean went sub 10k cases 60000 month. Shit's fucked medical side. Much like dinosaur Ducey want admit we're already extinct. everyone stopped locked we'd, maybe, maybe, get single hard month. won't, seems like people down. they'll go out, thing, come complain people getting essentials. Lol karen? Heard bunch ambulances today (in Santa Clara county)....very disheartening go - President Wilson denied existence, allow kind national legislation proclamations fear would hamper war effort. 

During Paris Peace talks virus started picking around, eventually getting wife personal doctor. still refused take precautions. virus viruses do. 

He would infected incapacitated take defend stances peace talks gurantees Germany ignored. head secret service dismayed wanted president removed office health. Wilson, delirious possibly hallucinating virus, refused. final treaty set stage would World War 2. 

The president's condition called ""a stroke"", never recovered. dead 6 months Health insurance costly, good job, going hospital big deal. wracked 25k bills crash. Cost $2500. Simply chose HSA high deductible.

not saying f***** everybody afraid go hospital. 1 1 every single one friends weekend going dinner people three different households

That bullshit. basically social life Germany since early May works perfectly fine. seen spike cases likely large gathering. Hanging friends outside, sitting outdoors cafe restaurant even small garden party like 10 people seems prefectly safe. Though started things infection rate slowed significantly Shows hard keep up. I've following pretty closely, know that. think way. stricter lockdown, would seeing continued cases. doesn’t trouble climate change end human civilization know within 20-30 years? Omg, day remembered \* codes wondered still worked.. remember numbers. also one see called Hope able move soon misty point wearing mask protect others. reason people think it’s true. 🙄 It’s shame president supported stood keep holding hand refusing wear one encourage others three months later, shit. learned nothing. still need close dine establishments implement travel ban across state lines.

Anything short feel good nonsense delaying inevitable. drinking alcohol way there? pre gaming essentially messenger #Masks4All groups news feed removed. like ever actively go anyones pages see they're to, remove news feed, remove far website. kind scary closely curve following cases started re-rising 5/4, deaths kept declining, deaths stopped declining plateaued starting 5/17 stayed way 6/6, point started rising out, biggest rise 6/14 yet subsided fact still rising (their record death toll cases started re-rising 6/19 deaths kept declining, decline slowing starting settle likely plateau. comparison Iran, 6/6 date would fall 7/22. decline slowing faster Iran’s did, rising infections also primarily starting among young people wouldnt surprised two factors cancel out. 

Another important factor dont think Iran july 4th-type holiday prior cases re-spiking. likely kick us overdrive. would join. something peaceful wrote. corporate bailouts passing losses poor, exactly? Lmao forgot /s certain segment country process losing damn mind. Cowboy? Well picture appears outdoors. 🙄 Damn.. Chicago schools open September (and COVID-19) getting cause effect mixed up.

It's newspaper funded Falun Gong. anti-CCP CCP anti-Falun Gong. Every single nation decline eventually. goes always comes down. 2 weeks ago, data pointed direction. pretty obvious happen.

Shut violators jail plague rats pandemic over. That’s pretty violent view. 290 people died Sunday ‘covid’ another 7,800 died causes. Come November okay protests/riot BLM thou right? say get caught ha Agreed,Poor ventilation problem. issue HVAC designs supply minimum ventilation codes allow inorder save costs. 100pc outside air Direct outside air systems energy recovery ventilation radiant systems heat/cooling answer. already common Europe commenters mentioned.

You look natural ventilation dismiss hand. Naturally ventilated spaces easy reach 15-20 Air Changes per hour. achieving something similar mechanical ventilation astronomical costs.This reason experts always recommend opening windows whenever possible. simple yet cost effective way similar face masks. Demand high, no? Could elaborate? yet countries managing lower cases. US special. could stop cared enough. country culture that's rotted entirely away due culture wars 99 goes.

Wouldn't ""the 99""? isn't, unless think covid-19 mild form flu politics, people days. That's pretty interesting. really exposure prepper community, cool get insight. many people US refusing wear masks makes angry. absolutely stupid. I'm sorry say I'm putting money guys dealing covid long time... It’s pretty interesting Foucault saw postmodernist thought means allowing individual decipher workings world around them, breaking relationships power governed thinking behavior could empowered agents rather robots controlled monolithic state institutions, laws, rules, regulations. Instead, however, reached logical conclusion destruction modernist systems administration without filling resulting void, 2020 America.

As detailed quite perfectly, everything takes relationship domination control (be body, mind, etc.) paralyzes government’s ability ensure universal compliance scientifically-grounded principles. “empowered” American, could leaders pushing policies mask-wearing, etc. form control via biopower, scientists whose research precipitated advice could seeking subjugation “Big Pharma” underlying science filled lies. People pick choose real real postmodern framework, anti-vaccine luminaries held equal regard world-renowned epidemiologists, isn’t wrong reason people think everyone agenda conflating freedom thought equality opinion.

The omnipresent suspicions resulting world viewed governed solely dynamics power domination come color interactions, discussion family, decision whether throw used mask middle parking lot rather trash can, newfound tendency among many labeling everything goes preconceived notions “fake news” regardless empirical veracity.

It’s stupid, logical conclusion postmodernism weaponized turned upon poorly-educated society superiority complex. assuming ever reason die down.   hasnt much correlation protesting spread virus according Oregon Health Authority. 

Not wearing masks around people indoors far bigger reason spread, apparently.

Shit ad hoc county county since start. joke. couldnt listen rest humanity.... clearly manipulated state level there's ample proof that. Literally google excess deaths year. surprise disappointment lot self-proclaimed preppers haven’t taking seriously. think always basically cosplaying others can’t accept right - don’t like mainstream. wear mask everywhere go. opinions problematic you. cousin dead permanent lung damage? Oh, sweet summer child... try though. main difference Ebola catch die. super obvious symptoms. this, catch probably die, probably kill somebody asymptomatic least part time, good chance asymptomatic whole time. shown convincingly. cases negative test followed positive test, cases full recovery followed actually getting sick again. suspect false negatives due low virus levels long recovery period.

Maybe people go hospital earlier now.  information bodes well reopening colleges fall. listener here. clarify claims makes regarding vitamin supplements? Meanwhile country record low month was...1... Good point. didn’t realize many people watch Fox News. Well. know reduce transmissions. We're ignorant stubborn actually requires minor MINOR sacrifice. worst generation go through, got easy. high school kids really need babysitting though? would think old enough home alone school work. know old enough babysit what’s difference actually reason. 25% city's inhabitants it, every 4th possible vector blocked. US “free” means “don’t help anyone problems, aren’t trying hard enough fuck them, *deserve* die”.

If someone given chance start born anywhere earth, new random body, fuck would pick US? New York already soft lockdown 4 weeks reached peak hospitalizations. went complete lockdown 1 week later.

Arizona currently almost [New York peak levels](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=states-normalized&amp;highlight=New%20York&amp;show=us-states&amp;y=both&amp;scale=linear&amp;data=cases-daily-7&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=right&amp;extra=Arizona#states-normalized) cases per capita right now, they've begun lockdown. feel like Arizona hit much, much harder... Idk bad, think anti mask people harm, causing death permanent health damage mask enforcers reduce harm.

Not advocating shooting anti mask people difference.  know that. think masks working. two charts showing daily new infections Virginia v. Oregon. Even though VA cumulative infections greater, state starting flatten curve, hopefully. Oregon trending upwards new cases every day. [New Covid-19 cases VA v.

Best play safe. r/N95MaskBuyandSupply Remember kids, it’s flamethrower flame shorter 6ft! Good thing hospitals don’t ever need supplies. food. equipment repairs. utilities like electricity, water, sewer service. 

The idea “hard lock down” hide bed virus goes away completely ridiculous. people would rather think everyone video covid, helps prove numbers higher. 

Personally doubt numbers higher, video shows complete mess early days. way kind accuracy. mass panic people rushing hospital, even without it, undoubtedly helped spread it. Wrong. Protecting others key benefit wearing mask, it’s benefit. also protects person wearing mask. That’s whole point.  Sure, lot people participate frivolous lawsuits, decides frivilous isn't? 

In general, best broad scope comes defining rights (in case: right file suit). anology would treat first amendment. protect everyone's right free speech without fear incarceration (this right withold consequences, however). ammendment includes folks morally express themselves, also includes people nefarious intentions. exceptions rule. example, could face legal (not civil) consequences forms speech like yelling ""fire"" movie theater, threatening bomb preschool, falsifying important documents, etc. 

I admit, argument merit regard famous hot coffee suit. question is: draw line? WEAR MASK ELSE!  sure looked coronavirus figures lately. responding comment Nixon information Nixon seems pretty topic me. Damn. fuckin nailed it. disease magnitude DEFINITELY come heads warning rest world, connected best interested rest world prepared well. even then, US Intelligence warned people put restrictions place started gathering resources needed back FEBRUARY latest. many people disease, although state herd immunity, harder virus get around something like every 6th 7th person putting biological barrier. $3k covid version Tamiflu. Hack America! Fuck yeah! option left shut whole state majority people vaccinated. It’s funny us NYC knew told everyone he’s cheat, failure, incompetent child. You’re operating assumption Americans capable making rational decisions based science data. Kudlow back cocaine? Ummmm talking myself. dumb wrong. shit, Larry. Well fuck point theres many cases nobody us actually sick sick

What bubble universe live in? 126k dead US! Yes, awful lot people ""sick sick"".

Since disease spreading regions overwhelmed first wave, currently handled fairly smoothly, change number cases ramp up. Even still, people dying disease every trend isnt rising

Yes is. theres mode tests. people could sick weeks months already got better.

That's anything works. First off, positivity rate going up. Look means. something masked testing.

Second, get disease months. lasts 5-10 days allergic reaction covid lol

Stop trying invent reasons trust science, please. might well throwing pasta wall see sticks.  Christ Bloomberg, NYT, Washington post go even single day without shitting America? believe Trump solve Covid problem?

As Chinese stunned.... That’s whole lotta nothing US declining inequality civil unrest since 70's... living rock hear China cancelling New Years, flights know tbh. country (australia) travel ban throughout - likely one factors leading us acquiring far lot cases US China, told. opened bars knowing people would gather...and people gathering idiots? No, year *before* pandemic hits. Duh. army came made pseudohospitals everywhere. government said didn’t need closed opened everything up. passive aggressive. NY look states can’t even mandatory masks social distancing. Y’all LEARNED example. rest country much time knowledge prevent this. Smh. Needs upvotes think time. like follow news Obama administration, wake every morning immediately wonder new horror happened overnight, either. Bruh see friends governors protesters blame.

Look Larry, ever heard Vietnam? Would win WW2 today's actors? I'm sure?. masks become optional?

Otherwise we're going lot planes going back airport throw people off, stupid people wear masks. clear early warning signs COVID significantly worse ""potential pandemics"". media cry ""pandemic potential"" every new virus bit ""boy cried wolf"" made lot people pay enough attention COVID.  r/bestof weirdness protests california, 5 days 2 weeks ago ?

You know things wrap around arm take blood pressure? disposable versions those, now. 

According signs Emergency room entrance, supposed drop Covid; meant call heard telling dude infected Skype call. think might mailing test kits people tossed drop-off box. least make good crazy American videos. virus spreads exponentially mitigation place, cases double every 3 days.

You calculate quite quickly long would take. yeah saw revolt one lost lunch good friggin luck.... many deaths appropriate shutdown you, Mags? Shit - even 5,000 sounds small compared 30,000,000.

Further, deaths gonna lag spike we’re seeing cases show deaths much later. 

Also - consider rainy day isn’t one? Sounds like don’t emergency don’t need utilize emergency department emergency test.  Basically wont believe anything truth themself want believe. Yeah I’m also confused they’re getting number 8k. know worldomoter tends bit inaccurate, that’s mostly start new “day” 5pm PST (they run GST). However, discrepancy worldometers totals CA’s official totals never around 400. true, would mean 2,000 additional cases reported 5pm, doesn’t seem case.

I’m trying justify high number, likely it’ll end high 6000’s low 7000’s, ~8000 seems way high Shut Walter. know homework. Where's money, Larry??? guy judge he’s fucking idiot.


And don’t tell civil, mods, people like causing people die. civil developed countries cooler climates US. one similar climate Australia, also experiencing resurgence.

you get winter Australia right right?

and 70 cases per day really resurgence given tested \~1-2% Melbourne's population days. comparison US tested 10% population 4 months

a similar 'resurgence' would 900 cases day US 45,000 would report to? Ofc do, unless sitting home, lol. mean weren’t effective short run?

They made specific ban week so. Handed fines abiding ban. Problem crowding stopped. lifted ban again. Problem didn’t reappear. 

In way effective? surreal. feels unreal watch semblance fight virus completely unravel.

They haven't. Yeah whole world made pig farmers eh? Lol. price drug excellent. know press smoking. checked price anti-retroviral drugs? 

What Gilead done till now? gave stock free.

They said developing countries produce Gilead demand royalties long export developed nations.

Gilead able make enough drug 2,000,000 till end year. current pricing looking profit 1 2 billion dollars. Superior drugs coming September (MABs, oral antiretrovirals) likely lot remdesivir unused. Gilead still produce it.

The curve begun flatten, still growing exponentially. takes two weeks mitigation efforts begin slow things down. people still going business masks, lockdown place - seems like mitigation done.

Well doubt could use hug. Shit's wild here. think—and someone correct I’m wrong—that positivity rate (the percentage tests come back positive) increasing, suggests increased testing capacity keeping rate spread. Therefore, although increase due increased testing, increased number cases still lower would seen enough testing done keep positivity rate lower, would mean could estimate widespread quickly cases spreading. 

In words, actual number cases higher increasing faster known data indicate, despite increased testing. many students going permanently left behind then? Already school districts reported 50% students weren’t even logging online classes. can't track spread.

He's consistent. something bad happens denies -- America accepted moved every time. Finally there's one problem one pretend disappeared... long anyway. quite massive, even noted infection still widespread. newly tested cases mostly mild symptoms burden healthcare system - people ordered isolate stay home. proven test positive follow quarantine, actually criminal act - teacher reportedly went work knowing covid-positive already fired going prosecuted. also lot easier find mask. Good luck finding spare ventilator. Corelation imply causation Trump showed talents conference.

Why? society doesn’t embrace intellectualism anymore. 

It’s really scary actually often wonder easily society could manipulated accepting authoritarianism exchange protection. narrative

My argument mean.

No, think countries worse flu rates. countries' media attempt claim excess deaths returned baseline. wore one walking around NYC full year COVID. people throw literal tantrums asked wear one 10 minutes store. can’t real. cant laws based race! April year deadliest month Sweden since January year 2000 really bad flue. Funny things brought US directly tied one political party... shove ass. damage public trust already done. say 70 80 per cent, say 50 60, seems quite debatable... considering actual effects climate change became widely apparent late 70s early '80s, point seeing complete breakdown entire ecosystems, millions tens millions excess deaths per year amongst human population, already living within exact delusions predicting.

Basically, world react climate change exactly like this, reacting fashion long created collective delusion waiting effects climate change manifest. Nobody said give up. need quickly realize we're isnt working. Postnord, used get rid nuclear waste future.

Also probably mad cop leaning someone's neck would protests that. 

The truth matter outside transmission rare. much Open protests. happen Lake Ozarks much happen BLM protests. 

Whether think people tonally consistent virus appears be. Came say this. politicians trying kill sick, economy doesn’t collapse already is. particular drug funded research grants government. thanks haha.

Come on! last little rant purely-political, rest factual 😂 say simply true, however notice ignored fact narrative relies surrounding countries much worse flu running around Sweden. sound reasonable you? ""facts?"" excess deaths matters countries Sweden?

You're trying make facts tell story want tell. super poorly. Hey least already habe half year behind us, right? 😬 Yes, still 10 12 percent positiva tests 60k 70k week. regions start even antibody tests, signed next Tuesday Cost 20 USD. think gigantic hidden number cases throughout last months, personal contacts mild cases. Also known [Public Choice I've employers stress phone choice call work sick, would *really* want company we're already short staffed? surprise attitude changed corona times, probably even worse lose employee quarentine may even ill. Make boss big mad can't make big monies. else fails, guess trying convince people wear masks economy may work. (That’s one excuses along, right?) nothing America. Nah, believe article recirculated air, goes hand hand. Lol Since expert facts maybe shed light seeing increase home deaths. people dying Covid dying heart attacks strokes scared go hospital? know underestimating estimating Covid deaths take current IFR grain salt. Whether higher lower one year know promise different current numbers. 

I've seen two patients pulmonary embolisms, one patient end dialysis one patient stroke. recent diagnosis Covid 19. virus around 4 months. I've current hospital 3 years. three years saw one person Flu develop inflammation around heart. still early I'm confident data show Covid 19, fatality complications nothing like Flu. flu predominantly respiratory virus. thought Covid like too, we're seeing endothelial virus impacts lining blood vessels. That's we're seeing lead strokes, blood clots damage virtually every organ body.

You're right 80 percent people mild cases. chances getting mild case pretty good. problem new virus entire country susceptible. country upwards 300,000,000 people 20 percent still huge number.

I've seen post history. ""It's flu"" ""Masks useless"" rally cries Fox news.

Just recap let's recall conversation developed. governor Texas said masks necessary. said held criminally liable hospitals reach capacity month. believe me. took longer month hospitals capacity. Take look New Jersey New York. strict lockdown enforced masks. still dealing cases faring much better Texas, Arizona, Florida pretty much every state enforcing masks. Maybe bad idea all. young white kids see wear masks. young black kids see wear them. know that's anecdotal, anybody else observed thing? Yeah, gonna happen.

If anything likely hear current leadership say masks choke kill you. death. Oh good, let's lie Coronavirus pretend big deal.

This disgusting dangerous thing do, course people want downplay pandemic it.

If tested positive, really pretending deadly virus justify compassionate toward people actually it. that's sick wrong.  Someone died wearing seatbelt. bother wearing seatbelts? sounds ... reasonable.

(article continues...) Yeah fair points. got almost identical deaths per capita Ireland overall I'd say we've done ok things bad quite sure we're taking ""lightly"". significant restrictions early on. Fauci also noted greatest increase cases coming people 40. Also, like, US freaking huge. lumped Europe together, curve would look lot like US, different regions peaks different times. New York like Italy, Arizona/Florida/California like Spain, France, Sweden. I’m saying things aren’t bad, are, they’re end days bad. Plus North East, real epicenter week ago, great right now. Man, USA fucked up... Similar feeling (Boston least). honest, ""lockdown bounce"" never occurred outside US, taking account western countries only. Italy's cases falling since Early april (yesterday something like 6 deaths 150 cases, 50% them, so, serological tests), France, Spain etc.

Each europen country, lockdown first, essentially fully reopened one month ago already. Yet, downward trend stay, Sweden. immunity. Meanwhile probably costs 30 cents dose something absurd like insulin. simply require everyone wears gun proof vests! Fine people fail comply!! Never said 1st Jan. YES. early Jan chinaflu sub, bet bottom dollar many people saw coming.

No, many panicked people made guess right. Every time they're wrong, got lucky, every time they're right, super smart. I'm fully aware 51 countries europe, reliable sources like statistika presenting information 13. go available. R e pub lican Space Rangers mo ther fu cker! 5th worse Europe. (And world). 

The countries Italy Spain got hit could react UK messed beginning Belgium many deaths counting differently everybody else. Vietnam isn’t US UK. measures used control virus wouldn’t allowed here. look hard people pushed back lockdowns wearing masks. Welcome Michigan 4 months ago, probably 2 weeks now. This. (European) slaughterhouse Covid surges due workers housed, transported treated. cold air air conditioning nothing air bombarded UVC light recycled, virus found air. 
 
Non-UVC lamp equipped air conditioners however... Shhhhhhh! 2020 listening, man. give ways Fuck us up! Well Russians getting frisky, sooooo........ long packed beaches last week. Fcked Katrina pretty badly - makes think he'll handle covid19 better? (better Trump low low bar...) whole thing inconclusive that's idea behind cover ups. 

Unless Florida straight says ""yes we're lying"" going hard pin anything 

You must admit weird report thousands new cases deaths trend observed anywhere else.

They also lot gain politically hiding extent damage everyone wore mask public places business's could operate, people could work customers could shop.

A simple solution. People fucking stupid. Haha held LA Marathon March despite people begging to. I’m judge never claimed be. said he’s judge.


Yes point sure fuck ain’t one 13 countries Europe ?? 

You must must American, lol falling naturaly, also social distance. thing sweden shows social distancing works, lockdown earlier lose less people unlike sweden. $199 still shameful. Middle road Europe. 5th don’t think that’s point. It’s places cannot social distance easily closed, gym limit people allowed regions occupy everyone exercise safely closed. Look comments gym suits Germany get bit this. “Hold Corona” Texas soon. Thata second wave works ... Ink made nano crystals emit near infrared light store medical history. That’s pretty damn close electronic device use today store electronic information, wonder call that?

Anyway, guys go first. I’ll wait eager folks go first. There’s quite history testing unsuspecting groups developing countries harmed testing products. 

No worries, go first Reality: shut fear getting virus, part long term plan. fun. Nice knowing dude Eventually will, collapse. separation church and... oh wait. Deaths declining many countryes. read, doctors learning better prevent people dying.

Also, found drugs, work patients like remdesevir others. drug cures everybody, several drugs fix % cases, adds up.

Also found good use ventilators much beginning.

So that, we're getting less dead/infected. So, apparently inconclusive news source.  jeez whooooshed eveyones heads ever play red car blue car? Slug bug? still one deaths per mil. Agree well. down. legitimately believed everyone pretended pandemic exist, would go away. think one understands potential/possibility second wave yet ... (*internal screaming intensifies*)


-. Me, nurse Florida also said drinking bleach might cure it, people started that. /S, sorry thought obvious enough hard time thinking true identify strain mutated actual reinfection strain person. like third fourth time claim made necessary testing done actually confirm case. Considering guy Brazil two months could another situation like that. Genetic resiliency takes generations develop, treat new pathogens like extreme care. happen sources verbalized wearing them? totally agree want receipts conservative parents And... what's wrong that? Sure, delivered without people's knowledge would pretty shit, that's case anything would go vaccine... saw early numbers think looked bad made comment along lines. Obviously got downvoted oblivion see one knew might happen 5th 13. That's middle road I'm smoke. must differ place place, always kids running nose day care, none. both? work though. consequences wear mask (no fines places still let in).



I'm California (further north Sacramento). many care.. places opened lifts many salons etc enforce masks. fucking absurd. wearing mask go 8-16 work care. Talk cheap. Pass bill make mandatory nationwide, mitch. That's happens make politics sport, spend century fostering team tribalism prisons. Transfers San Quentin seeded another prison outbreak north. Quentin got infected another prison transfer. 

But Bay Area going feel one sure. Meanwhile, Marin County opened dine-in restaurants today. bad! Keep get 3x number infected deaths compared Brazil (2nd highest) pretty soon. Elon Musk

They give money sake it. Maryland we've wearing since April. one states actually declining numbers. like masks work. Bout time see confederate flags around Eugene life much better lockdown. Yes, worth cost seeing family able spend time home. need higher quality Facebook friends, friend. picked Florida poster referenced US's upswing. locking towns cities reports 2-10 cases COVID-19 infection.


It’s laughably late country West it’s spreading like wildfire implement Vietnam’s strategies. northern Italy mainly due fact healthcare workers among first infected ICU staffed 70% capacity. 
Before known COVID, patients flooded ER Lombardy Venetian thus infected many healthcare workers. Chickenpox caused DNA virus herpes family. reason cause shingles hide nerves lay dormant.

Coronaviruses same. They're RNA, encode proteins comapred hundreds DNA virus encode. 

Any long term effects people likely damage incurred immune systems inflammation damages sytems organs. war information sounds right. \#3 especially surprising - kind narcissistic businessman would fail this? Even (for legal reasons) can't brand himself/white house, easily brand MAGA/Ivanka/etc kids home day care school show slightest sign cold/flu

My understanding sighing co-workers (during normal times pandemic) day care tend time. What??? I've heard this.

Holy need way.

Be Resilient! Decide price then, sure. consumer needs product live gets control demand. ought unlawful pharma artificially manipulate supply order influence price. Supply ought mandatory 1.5x expected demand, case world over. Economies scale products ought influence price benefit consumer too, huge margin huge volume pharma. pushing district become Italy-like

Well become Italy like soon enough... joking? Deaths per capita way near bottom. must smoking it. Yup. dream buying stocks make. something like car breaking suddenly happened, might fucked. Compared what? numbers middle road Europe. dye injected you

Probably conflated  Fed money machine go burrrrrrr deaths hiaoitalizations continually decline 2 months. 

I clue comment ""death rates"" even trying say. live Eastern Oregon, confirm  Famous last words. !rekindle 2 weeks anyone else? They're middle road Europe. natural behavioral changes much different enforced ones - enforced changes end date, human nature done end. Natural changes much stronger lasting effect. Like said another comment, time tell, looking much better. Yeah..... Except spent 3 months beginning lying us saying masks don’t work.

Short memory? pick Florida comparison? Germany Norway? places sustainable strategies lot less deaths. Sweden massively screwed up, let lot people die needlessly still lot risk going forward. Pathetic strategy tragic outcome threatening week. fucking it. ""expert"" mentions proof ""different strains"" stop reading. entire article trash making false misleading claims. Right? Wtf now, percentage stupidities country could get ugly. European think it’s because

1) education system, way thinking general. You’re indoctrinated way right now. mean seems me, outsider, you’re effectively using sense justice. you’re aware you’re one legitimises law. Laws would legit thought legitimate. Law makers “makes” law accept refuse it. ultimate veto power directly hand common individual, Europe, even Turkey see this, even conservative Turks support Erdogan doesn’t necessarily obey him, compass, sense justice, learned parents, basically listen hearts something erdogan, government cop something don’t approve would literally intervene moment. something like “I can’t breathe” can’t happen Europe people would certainly intervene. people know source legitimacy justice.

2) voter turnout high enough, high every election. It’s simple task “ELECTION DAYS NATIONAL VACATIONS EVERYONE VOTE”

3) don’t protest enough, don’t gather together furiously frequently enough issue coming back indoctrination, protest gatherings, protest small things daily life individual, don’t use phrases like “not nice” instead use words like “bad” “terrible” is.  sustainable long run effective short run. still talking handing fines 16 year olds hanging park, ridiculous. sure hell beat virus worked exactly planned.

ok. Neither assuming new York reached herd immunity. Especially negligible 5% comes liberal estimate assuming 1 million cases, reported 263,000 cases. would cause percentage drop massively. alive ? I've situation least twice every week wat Kansas source mis-named Spanish Influenza 1918 - 1919? yes, believe is.

The Kansas Flu pandemic. People love conspiracy theories. Anybody seems obviously interested good wellbeing humanity met skepticism. least seems trend. Deaths page cases 2-4 weeks. Um okay, someone visits countries another country carries virus prevent another outbreak? Test every entry? one person retrigger entire thing. Ah yes - mass killing avoid mass death. exactly type person listen to. admit shocked testing VIC mandatory states. 

Im really across hotel situation...are good articles breaches? lot NY deaths nursing homes Gov Cuomo forced take infected patients hospital led 5,000+ senior deaths could otherwise avoided. bad. Right Texas, spiking, spiking younger, healthier adults death rate going up. ICUs full 25% COVID 19 patients, it’s really big issue seems. interesting see new numbers 2-3 weeks though already planning going out. Hence pre-gaming. honestly baffles wasn’t concerted effort make national push everywhere close across states could’ve big Fourth July blowout. Instead, played whack mole let people travel states carrying weren’t essential (no one needs get plane vacation right plane essential, it’s one way ticket mandatory quarantine.) absolutely agree you, need proactive. Billionaire admits enough money help amount stupidity I've seen stats 30% depending covering used. 

And honestly, playing videogame item gave 30% resistance I'd consider pretty damn good. detol strippers cheeks every clap article still shows cases US grandeur. greatest civilization decline history, yeah no. systems stir air way air constantly refreshed to, think, 185cm room height line dirty air smells, lower oxygen, heighter temperatures, pathogens, etc.

This norm country least large scale systems. Elon announced wants put microchips brains, people applaud it

When Bill wants cure pandemic, people suspect foul play wanting put microchips inside us NY infected people late January, likely. math says shown roughly early order spread much did. Also Chinese New Year, single largest travel event year, late January. many people traveling China. CNY like Thanksgiving Christmas rolled together, holiday visiting relatives.

As far southern states go, think wrong saying money. that. criteria economy, reopen fast. wait confidence higher, maintain confidence avoiding second shutdown. Waffling back forth makes people scared, crimps economy.

The calls reopening mostly coming wealthy. far less affected general population, therefore ignorant risks. cases know risks, care hurting people. Also there's whole tribal attitude right, ignoring reality badge honor. people denial become part identity mock inconvenient science. people still think hoax. I'm excited. Lol would hope don’t like paranoid covid tho compared USA like lighter beside firestorm age well. Yeah, get this. state-level thing. states lead federal assistance.  churches protest organizers too? wonder fuck people even came across idea Bill Gates evil mastermind... Murder millions... wtf?!? mention idea long takes get back normal. lung issue 2007 took 6-9 months feel good feel like could fully breathe again. lasting effects yearly check never go back pulmonologist. 

We idea thing happen here. It’s possible say “permanent damage” virus hasn’t even around year. AC. Real easy install. - installed AC large tents desert. again, assumption someone exposed means contract virus. virology work way. likely many people wont get virus unknown reasons. likely spread disease asymptomatic. should’ve enforced mandatory quarantine travellers mandatory testing release. should’ve ensured hotels adequately staffed adequate levels enforcement 

They fucked we’re 

There’s nothing else now. Texas Underetaker's Union. thus far, half lawsuits successful. Yeah read much posted it. Looking seems right. There's lot confounding variables give impression AC root cause spread seem case Sorry thought dumb tramp supporting state Florida something. Sending love Brazil babysitter person job trained parent experience in. I'm great teaching children enjoy Maybe would teacher. work provide child. know world live parents work least 9-5. son's classes online nearly useless. can't stare screen long periods cause gets ancy little. Honestly waiting years vaccine ridiculous. personally believe cure going accept like accept flu move on. 1 108 chance dying car crash still manage drive work every day. son however wear mask fine six. also wash hands. Kids wear masks wash hands. social distancing happen. amount PPE single person could use day would shock you.


Can confirm, hospitalizes couple weeks ago change masks PPE garments everytime nurse/doctor left room. Filled trashcan full within three hours. Right scientists sending stuff publication would never normally. Preprints really public consumption often hypotheticals still need tested. see sorts contradictory stuff. absolutely guarantee lot people take ""threat"" ""Oh shit, I'd better go many things possible lockdown again!""

Just fucking already, Newsom. Pretty much. Lol. area called ""Kentuckiana"", afterall. Americans too. Even CDC admits coronavirus figures 10 times official figures. ticket stupid people stupid?
 

I write law like that. Ticketing people children can't even support probably popular. Gosh people stop.... might able explain phenomenon even though know called.

When first got diagnosed chronic illness, never really wanted accept chronic. wanted accept right things I'd cured.

I would get new medication, take while, say ""I'm cured"" stop taking it. reason felt ""cured"" cured, properly maintaining medication. fact felt fine led believe cured, continuing needed done whole life.

Because actually flatten curve properly places start (and Trumpland get lot cases beginning due probably density), people led believe serious thing we'd beaten it, least kept check could go back normal take less seriously.

What actually fall trap, simple, but: things good continuing do. cured disease. stopped that, came back.

Based history phenomenon, we're probably going series situations straight get vaccine. I'd say... Wait two weeks. outside US, governments regulate prices drugs live Tucson McDonald's giant rex(put jurasssic park first came out). put mask dinosaur, really encouraged toddler wear mask. lucked there. Maybe Dr. Trump stopped interfering contradicting Fauci would people open wearing masks public.  Instead Idiots crying freedumb. B..but..but..murca.... This!  50 death thoses kind numbers kinda weird imao... Make believe theres alot false positive like Elon Musk said... New York except NYC amount cases NYC. NYC also somewhat low rate city size density. NY got shit right went sideways learned Wow!!! soon ground truth Northeast, includes new york, hardest hit region country? election year. 2016 gold standard cursed years 2020 remember 2012 kind lame well. military retires gear goes distribution process passed along police forces. includes armored vehicles, tanks, etc. Try sneezing.
Now try sneezing mask.

Notice difference?

And yes wearing mask also protects others, lesser extend.

I think it’s 75% sneezing 25% particles others. Good. Hope companies follow suit think means keep heat *up* open windows. I'm getting last months like watching semi slowly back towards us, semi going reverse gas floor. I'm sure going get fallout people dude, that's hot tea right there. That's exactly fricking right. That's COVID overload New York hospitals. sent excess capacity home empty. certainly pushed brink, overwhelming implies space left patients. think people already caught lying saying crossing Alaska something. think cases getting worse sort inevitable close them. knows I’m idiot reddit. hope government figures something out. California shits going rails. first started hotspot bad. tried nip bud even bud. Things seemed like they'd go alright. bunch idiots thought ruined we're really hotspot. places like bay area generally well (I hate say sounds kind hateful but) better educated seeing surge quite bad. wish people would get thick skulls shit supposed could control like Europe asia Severe flak never stopped pharmaceutical company price gouging. interest rates great. move obviously controversial Murdoch propaganda machine full force I'd like know proven solutions Vic available? Oh getting message loud clear top though. 

Coronavirus nothing afraid whole thing **plan**demic make us wear devils mask. That's message top. Good luck America. Make lung shows, gun shows. Oh good, we’re “people hallways capacity”, relief.

Hospitals never people hallways, especially ICU patients especially pandemic. Even hospitals make extra ICU beds, going take care patients? can’t materialize ICU nurses thin air. Everyone strap skate gear. chance America get's passed blue line. vivid memories 1998 floods 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.

That's big deal rest stop 100 workers hotel, restaurants, grounds, maintenance, truck center garage. 

When virus started, gm received phone call owner promising workers laid would interview position, take pay cut. sent chefs resorts kitchens work, paid health insurance month.

They also charge employees live employee housing rent laid off.

We required wear masks work, sanitize store every hour, get temperature checks, closed bar, limited seating tables, dividers. 

If ever need ice cream I-80 corridor, please pay us visit. reason job, helped give 100+ people hope times.

It makes think.

Try it. Big update incoming soon. extra test data. fucked opening fast early idiot. 

 guns Canada, get free health care. I’m pretty sure honest would worked. People would still buy even masks know helps (others). 

I think way. 

Meanwhile Netherlands wear masks public transport. got control easing restrictions weeks now. Netherlands super dense country well. 

Common sense masks. 

Just distance others stop spread works well. We’ve proven European countries. 

But guess that’s working US, better wear masks then!  different reporting methodologies make wish published international standard reporting would provide public health agencies around world means share data clear, concise manner. California feel lucky Disneyland opened yet put off. Right, give up. tried nothing we're ideas every solution ""too difficult.""

So checked nieces school home system summer break. one thing saw wrong go 500 different links. simple solution would teachers make videos teaching like would class. 

As far ""I can't teach kid"" thing. No, make lessons though, make homework. Ask boss one. inference. literally observation truth. 

The media needs clicks, controversy scary news gets clicks ad revenue. 

It's logical.  Lol president said we’d months ago Shit rolls downhill, look top hill  unrelated, think police enforce handicap parking rules much strictly currently do. would find hundred bucks oh, local police could support additional staff members Walmart parking lot everyday theoretically hopefully course months people would realize can't parking places infringe rights others. Especially rights vulnerable similar situation- extreme still risk uncomfortable with. Luckily mom level headed talked explained reasoning decided wasn’t worth risk right now, especially cases rising area. Would honest discussion help no? Personally think US's best option universal healthcare would states start implementing first, never going go federal level could see California Iowa state level. would still cost savings people state would make harder nearby states make stuff universal healthcare people friends family living much better standard. state's would something stop people states coming free healthcare stop systems overrun would definitely good catalyst.

Once enough states universal healthcare it'll eventually pushed federal level people know people living states universal healthcare see obvious advantages. There'll lobbying healthcare industry obvious reasons eventually it'll happen. It'd take long time taken (probably least 15 years) would massive improvement.

Or even laws amounts hospitals charge, full universal healthcare long healthcare actually affordable. vaccine pretty quickly also seem allowed come work feeling objectively sick, NONO Germany. think that's going huge problem Canada.

Coulda got fed service industry. Let’s keep people inside A/C. That’ll stop virus. *rolls eyes* We’re currently 2, 10 last 3 weeks.

No they’re counting overdeaths covid, horse still taken seriously Fauci face  walk around suburban neighborhood EXCEPTIONALLY low risk

-Start walking, neighbors stoop see wave

-Walk talk 5 minutes etc

-Keep walking another neighbor know sees waves

Truly do. reddit keeping schools closed, like virus magically going disappear September, HAHAHA. Exactly. sources entertainment closed, else would people congregate? Irresponsible keep restaurants open. seen reports ICUs reaching capacity? go ICU, means serious problem.

 focus media death it’s easy calculate, given sheer number people affected different types effects, short turn around study difficult. Given fact cardiovascular disease diabetes preexisting condition fairly prevalent US, wouldn’t conclude isolated cases isolated.

Please true. waiting life insurance denials come in. first many start hearing about. see instances rules applying select number counties makes sense. North Dakota 53 counties, 81% positive cases come three counties. 63% total positive cases come Cass County. still four counties cases yet, we've got 17 additional counties without active cases. 

That means 21 53 counties active cases (that know of). think totally understandable could different restrictions Cass county, 175 active cases. That's active cases two counties total cases. 

Granted, think wise everyone wear mask like 3 weeks.

Cases flattened places, knowledge learned virus, places idea prepare supplies started ticking upwards.

Then moved reopening things virus gone tampered down. Basic precautions ignored properly implemented cases spiking would done initially nothing. still limited supplies space patients there's growing concern filling ICUs. There's still limited supplies medicine well explosive growth cases continue dwindle supplies. 

The part explained well flattening curve also elongates curve much longer period time. measures need put place keep spiking. Outbreaks occur cases still happen things reopen function measures taken protect people.  On/Off switch lockdown/wide open.

The messaging implementation nothing short absolutely terrible. Netherlands 8th worst world deaths per capita, roughly equivalent US. They've gotten things control early followed plan UK resisting lockdown long possible It’s got start somewhere! Thanks doing. I’m hoping gets light deserves. need break this. Good work.. coming forward helping community... good work.. Haha, bit mouthfull sentence, give that. Winter? coming hard ""right now*  sheriff anti-masker? Someone's holding SPY puts.... too, buddy. Little late one Charlie.

It's comforting know said done, one face repercussions mixed messages, politicized messages, purely ignorant messages organizations, politicians , media outlets spewed lead destruction economy hundreds thousands deaths. 25% deaths. means medical treatment par rest world. terrible. police weren’t busy killing unarmed black people suppressing free speech. 

A lot fully wearing masks, let alone enforcing others to. time you’ll see masks shoot tear gas. Still shut churches. Pretty sure life Africa right really bad. barely reported people honestly care million people died there. Remember brutal civil war millions beheaded 20 years ago? seemed rest world gave damn. Better yet, pass law prohibiting masks church. suspect reason behind high # cases

Almost certainly. Fair absolutely baffled stock market response this. Perhaps Q2 earnings season reality check?

Who kidding, reality check followed large government check given prop everything though November. long continue kick here? next blip. next... Yes, bar however many people socially distancing wearing masks problem thinking reopening bars.

I’m sorry I’m letting push narrative right sides far morally equivalent next war, gotta give Germany first whole invading neutral Belgium thing. try, succeed. US politicians trying.

We still, day, mask orders number US states.

We still, day, federal leadership. 

They hold events like news conferences round tables, spend entire time congratulating complementing other.  

But, still tell public wear masks. herd immunity now? called white fragility. war Christmas, aka biggest holiday Earth. Stop spreading propaganda disease causes irreparable lung damage. Speak doctor subject they’ll tell it’s bullshit. Maybe you’re 90 years old bad lungs begin you’re sick 3 months. average person isn’t getting irreparable damage virus. liability pretend due diligence. base belief on?

I think zero base thinking think, except emotions.

Emotions real bad guide dealing facts. trying judge ""is bible PCR guys claim"", go ask scientists reddit? rely feelings moment. lazy read it, don't. elderly inlaws wear visit them. visit outside least 6 feet us wear masks.

They basically visiting family like everything normal. 

They're going die keep stupid shit (and will). Existence ""death cult"". immortal? No? going driving car work despite obvious imminent death different people going lives despite similar danger? ""go team red"" crowd votes every single election, 100% time, 20% people might vote others bothered every 4 years, maybe. want leave What? leader telling everyone wear masks? Finally four months listening Fauci. shit show. bar 50 people problem, done talking science deniers.  completely correct. Deaths lag behind 2-3 weeks numbers shoot up. 

This shit sucks man. it’s true people died covid April may died month two later anyway, seeing dip displaced mortalities? mean single entree? something drink sharing appetizer turn dinner (a meal) two three separate meals? Fuck right. real world even worse... instead happening middle lockdown happening they're mostly open, going get much worse even Wuhan leave house reason lockdown imposed today. epidemic still continuing countries. Wearing mask causes people touch faces much often usual. dunno got numbers from. Los Angeles County 10 million people doesn’t even cover entire Greater Los Angeles Area. California 40 million people Australia’s 25 million. We’ve still got way many cases, though. death numbers exactly trustworthy. probably status quo unless Trump supporting governors finally agree masks worn. get Trump get ball masks, finally start beating thing. supporters follow depths hell possibly fall line say people weren’t masks monsters. 

As long Trump governors like one Florida still so-so masks, state opening closing get vaccine. hopefully start fining people 2-5k USD comply, enough enough, America treating virus like nothing, comedic way. think circumstances answer still yes, really. get drugs expensive develop, clinical trials even expensive. Companies profitable, sure. prices charged medications cost less dollar dose manufacture sometimes decades (so they've paid research cost 10 times over) ridiculous.

A similar situation exists healthcare costs US. covered insurance, serious, blue-in-the-face asthma attack. rescue inhaler nothing airways closed get enough drug affected area. simply could afford ambulance ride ER 4 morning. wait outside urgent care opened 7, provider pretty much yelled going ER. understand position, simply could afford thousands dollars ambulance ride treatment ER.

Why situation exists basically money insurance, require medical attention, SOL? administration trying dismantle efforts towards universal healthcare, see situation getting better.

/rant they're spreading people wear masks, aka trumpists. Young people federal officials: we're poor can't afford work

Yeah... No, article clearly stated referring kind situations youngsters go bars, parties similar social events caring safety measures infect get infected. COVID soup! Lol that’s nasty says billion dollars ramp production. drug already developed $70 million went. Florida fiiiine. Nothing see here. Keep ‘me coming. /s honestly can't differentiate protesting ordering goddamn tacos? serious? Right. deaths uniformly distributed would expect .4% total COVID death happen nursing homes. company legally required compensate two weeks, per CARES act. also extended beyond issues family members. need spoon feed idiots information 

Wtf. Dude. Chill out. internet lol. 
SpEwIng MisInFormAtion

WHY HONEST  WHATS END GAMEEEE😭 Fed. Governments scientists done nothing improve situation. Masks work, must wear masks. Need ventilators stat, nevermind. Mathematics, raw data computer code behind forecast models proven garbage time time. Pre-release studies released fact proven junk.

If scientific community wants trust, maybe fucking earn it. could say hindsight 2020. fair, everyone dies *will* though.

Death solves everything.

- ~~Ioseph Stalin Michael Scott~~ Donald Trump unrealistic expectation people going tolerate long society remain liminal state without suffering permanent damage.

Let's learn live without hospitals due overrun, big brain logic there. pure ideology overriding hundreds thousands years instinct bunker middle deadly pandemic Excess deaths stopped discussed countries got covid deaths control. Sweden confirmed covid deaths highest rate Europe, think claiming longer excess deaths spinning severity high infection rates? already pointed notion excess deaths Sweden illusion already experiencing mild year all-cause mortality covid-19 came along. 

Covid-19 pushed Swedish all-cause mortality average year, back average. Like, meaningless statement say excess deaths, covid-19 deaths preventable still happening.

Say Sweden bad flu season covid came along. sudden, could use metric imply covid CAUSING excess deaths, key common factor all-cause mortality year largely influenced influensa. Take influensa equation, parameter varies much year year.

Sweden highest death rate europe covid weeks. bad thing. focus that, skewed metrics influenced another illness. Came back upvote cause smiled🤷‍♂️ Humanity America... Almost like anyone sign account one popular social media sites Internet something. what? one kinds mouth breathing dipshits thinks Reddit secret, underground thing or..... Edited post include sourcr knew something shifted McConnell came support masks. elites finally math figured saving human capital stock best interest pocket book. Discipline - trait many Japan honed years years, and, frankly, people US possess themselves. New York peaked 11.6k new cases shut closer 3000

[source  helps ""Fauci says pandemic bad"", half stuff here. people social distancing wearing masks, trump voters. fine. Idiocracy favorite movie, too!! Larry going bloomberg biz Thursday. Can't wait. 

99.1FM world overdue culling. Every week going horrendous lax governors start locking shit work. 
The reason we're still dolts politicize science, learn god damn hard way. 
Also weeks coming weekend another boom bc, ""it's July 4th weekend! woooo!"".... *sigh*. people always win game. 

IT sickening. *Fingers crossed* trying avoid? Political calculations hell US authoroties doing?

Pandering stupid. Yeah phase 3 started. vaccine approved use October, would 4 months wild. Payless shoes. Maybe TX counter sue bars hospitals bills burial costs?!?!  Twice week? Wow, take week vit level 11.5 ng/mL. single digits? I'm sure motivation health troops families /s family member works restaurant someone confirmed positive yesterday still can’t get tested anywhere. joke. POTUS screaming twitter LIBERATE! Karen Trump cultists taking state houses military assault weapons wanted fucking haircut nail job damn tattoo!

Thats why! Interesting take daily fish oil idea wouldn’t work without calcium n something fatty thanks info! many cases transported ALFs hospitals? I'd like know what's considered hyper vigilant days. keep hearing people ""being super careful"" they're visiting friends getting hair done lol. sure showed them! way anyone gonna make wear mask now! Same. I'm 38-year-old engineer three kids. partner engineer, too. We're great. kids great. We're good position society, regret kids. 

And right, economically, least people need kids (or need open immigration policies lot we're reproducing replacement) declining population smaller generations bad business (just look Japan). better least kids raised people thought through, raising well. We've seen Idiocracy now. LMAO need sources drug cost billion dollars develop. Seriously. 18-day old account telling us live PrOtEsTeRs DiDnT SpReAd It! Except Corona nukes sense smell - anyone virus would immune. know “culture” is. herd immunity #FF Sweden #2A. High drugs passing counterfeit bills resisting arrest. 50% adult life behind bars. 
Very ""responsible"" citizen. unfortunate enough diagnosed Kawasaki disease kid, children going serious hell potentially life spanning consequences. hate see many others deal man child didnt want act aggressively hurt relection chances. Virus economy.

 Mask lockdown. talking protest Aw you’re cute, bitter little USA Stan! That’s precious. see comments got political philosophy understanding America combination Twitter Rachel Maddow. everyone quarantined stadium. going home meeting friends loved ones don’t share ideals. could follow event traveling across states vacations, going business employees deal refusal wear masks... issue virus won’t stop them. People can’t stay inside work, shop, go outside jog. Unless al N-95 mask, wearing one much public they’re confronted infections person wearing one. People sure obsessed US subreddit. Damn near every post Coronavirus main page US every upvoted comment ripping US. countries exist anymore what? bizarre obsessed foreigners United States shit every chance get. Great timing Mitch. strict mean stricter US Johnson County definitely going overturn I'm tired hearing everyone shaming crazy lady grocery store say nothing 100000s protestors. dont think thats true. Lots leaders inspired great loyalty way they've handled this. Cuomo, example.

Trump handled situation entirely wrong. Every instinct opposite needed. he'd good leader (even FAKING empathy) would come looking like hero.

In way, we're lucky Trump incompetent boob is. Otherwise might looking 4 years. Vitamin really absorbed take calcium something fatty. That’s calcium supplements include vitamin D. yet majority people die, aren't. put first regard taxpayers. complained asked make modest contribution health benefits people private sector paying much more. union shakes taxpayers fund early retirement cushy benefits. demand expect guaranteed annual raises taxpayers laid overwhelmed taxes. complain underpaid part time job. Many retire states much lower taxes collecting generous pension paid NJ taxpayers. enforcement customer raids cash register?

Who enforcement drunk gets violent abusive? 

Who keeps customers smoking inside? cutting lines bar? pissing potted plant. 


It's problem. solution changed. stop someone else's droplets reaching me, think cloth mask quite helpful. cannot stay locked indefinitely pin hopes vaccine herd immunity, appearing less likely effective fix. unrealistic expectation people going tolerate long society remain liminal state without suffering permanent damage. Please wear masks. True, that's unfortunate consequence. fewer trump voters loses could worth cost. Thanks showing work despite exhaustion disappointment. mom best friend (both passed now) nurses. takes certain kind personality grit work health care. think people understood that—really understood it—they would act conscientious manner sake heath care workers too. Y’all human beings, really sucks. 

I know mean “business usual.” many states trying claw thing back (did see Arizona today? Wow!), Florida... I’m loss.

One day time. Keep mind Florida 21 million people Poland’s 38 million. US states big (but we’re still fucking things royally across board). Prepare lawsuit probably lose took employers clients you. really odd list states. [Others far worse right US tax payers funded 7% R&amp;D costs. I'm even USA. I'm white male.

What bias? whole world knows USA full black hating, white supremacist, brainwashed idiots.

The majority protests peaceful. know independent, non biased media here. fox news, actual joke among rest world.

Biased, discriminatory, opinionated bullshit. Americans US fall that. probably take advice heart - need adapt world have, means packing students confined spaces pandemic.

You're one trying force reality upon situation, selfawarewolf. see anecdotal stories there's real way tell really ""hyperviligant"" spread vectors accounting for.

Or (or husband) vigilant thought. I've seen many people claim careful still risky things. looks like influence operations back Everything money politicians. save olympics cause it’s huge cash cow, cares infections. you’re using percentages talk fatality rate, it’s low. something similar like flu, case fatality rate along lines 1 100,000. always count Americans right thing - they've tried everything else.

-Winston Churchill Tested low (very low) back 2009. Doc said take 5k IU per day 8 weeks got retested. normal solidly above. taking 2k IU daily since every test good. Oddly, sick way except 2 stomach viruses last 11 years. vitamin D? knows I'm def going keep everything I'm now. we’re going tell youth screw off? Take ton debt Zoom university Karen goes shopping without mask? July 1 now. Potentially dangerous things done responsible manner mitigates risk significantly.

In currently dangerous situation COVID, options mitigate risk well, many people flaunting refusing risk mitigation.

That's sort behavior people refer talk death cult. work tribal casino claims sovereignty all? Alright then, keep secrets. early March hit Texas, installed commercial grade UVC lights central air return ductwork replaced air filters filters similar Hepa filters (Hepa longer available A/C systems restricts airflow severely harming fan motors) psychiatric residential facility operate. “fan on” option runs continuously keep air circulating central air systems reduce aerosols present room air. Portable UVC lights also used vacated bedroom three times week hour, several rooms set negative pressure get case. many mitigation measures taken well. date case SARS-CoV-2. 

I’m unsure measures working; however prudent seek much research recommendations possible congregate living. data suggests young adults aren’t risk serious health consequences COVID. problem interface older people, risk. needed comprehensive strategy pandemic. Total failure. Actually still Karen apprentice. still training, though shows lots potential. hear lot kind behaviour US, anywhere else. news distortion reality?


I know Canada (here), people behaving fairly well. wonder countries...


But restaurant close, means behaviour fairly common US. 


It's amazing selfishness raised countrywide level.... Ayn Rand still alive, guess would amongst first casualties... ever over. 
So shut permanently? 

Okay! Sounds good me. 
Less drunks deal with. ""i dont agree you’re quick Canada 8500 deaths Mexico 27000 deaths. going bad either way. would way 10000 deaths. country essentially given up. even contained. see someone without mask turn head away walk far around them, try talk me, keep head turned away like I'm trying avoid nasty covid breath give askance look. bet also wears seatbelt incur $50 fine. reverse Jaws. Well done california. value perspective sea USAmerican ones. Could asymptomatic known contact confirmed cases? Still deplorable.. can't discount insidiously spread assholes everywhere, even Spain. speak area, see total compliance. see guy walk supermarket without one last week, got 6' inside asked leave. People generally respectful police although shoot people, quite ""forceful"". Correct, remembered wrong.

In belgium cases symptoms test also tested, FHM ""I wear something that's sightly uncomfortable save others? Fuck then."" wish would case Netherlands. Numbers might we’re still mess, yet people going like nothing ever happened!

I’ve dared visit parents (who COPD) since februari, last week necessity. people don’t care anymore, even public transport definitely grocery shopping.. Traveling back visit multiple people train, mask, coughing even bothering turn heads, could think “I better visit family within next couple weeks safe”.. ""People got entitlements much mind, without obligations. thing entitlement, unless someone first met obligation.” - Margret Thatcher

That speaks side mask argument, also.  People obligation refrain injuring others, hence wear mask. think six year old getting first six years formal education basic reading writing greatly underestimating needs accomplished quite frankly insulting early childhood educators.  Sure helps living island... saw coming. bet too.

For years, graduated college, alarmed expected US, people acted treated other, general careless us Americans carry relation real shit like politics, government, health, etc. everyone would keep heads work waiting weekend. I'd assume supermarkets malls making masks mandatory example, order let pro-rights morons able go liberties... Indoors IO! Reddit seems full angels demons (and lurkers guess). 
 
There lots lovely helpful people also lot total bellends death numbers median. confidence interval broad I'm sure much believe actually help. time cut, may true.

All I'm saying wonder drug, yet Gilead charging arm leg it. ""nobody saw coming""

We knew would happen. Anyone chose think could see plan day. 

But go ahead, open economy. Everyone wants go back work right? hoax right? /s probably happen Illinois soon enough. It’s becoming clear industries simply spread virus much many places simply need shut down.

At point time it’s saving economy much it’s saving lives. case counts get high shutdown medical industry, schools, daycares, courts, prisons, food processing plants, factories, things make core industries keep economy, indeed society afloat. 

I feel bad people industries like dining, hospitality gyms fact matter saving industries isn’t worth tanking everything else society. federal government going step give workers support stay closed. hate say point talking survival fittest. MUST protect core industries. Eh, r/coronavirus r/influenza long, thanks fish. Four years ago many people might tuned in. sad joke.

Inb4 fireworks colered orange😂 Bingo. belief need someone actually intelligent role. need game manager relies experts.

The experts quickly shown door ignored. 

yay.  According Shit, I've wearing mask since first cases detected back state back February. Literally everyone gave weird looks go something wearing mask. People I'd talk would tell anything anyways. I'd ignore physical barrier *something* reduce likelihood transmission. Lets forget millions across entire planet got sick one person wuhan. ...talk contagious! do, you? sub there's already multiple stories studies following discharged covid cases sustained serious injury, especially lung fibrosis. links I've read suggest 30% discharged cases still made full recovery. 

Now comparing Norway Denmark Sweden's far greater long term health impact virus allowed spread most. 

While covid deaths grab headlines Covid Syndrome medical condition many people decades after. SARS. thing is, except travelers came elsewhere, NYC healthcare professionals going needed nyc for...normal patient care. Hospitals usually don’t extra staff lying around twiddling thumbs time. fact, it’s super common working short normal circumstances. Fuck shitty country. glad I'm French citizen bounce need be. elsewhere news country reports lowest daily Covid death numbers since March downward trend continues. Neither bill fact. comparison whether COVID19 dangerous disease even bad flu season, pretty fucking clear is. 

We're trying answer question whether swedens measures adequate. measures brought deaths level 2000 flu season, would anyone argue sweden implemented harsher measures year 2000 1993? comparison I'm trying also makes sense pick 1 month flu hit compare random month 5 month corona outbreak, still much ongoing. 

1. month April (by far) worst one terms deaths, means random month.
2. 2000 1993 flu seasons stop 1 month. I'm sure could look cause mortality seasons somewhere.
3. still ongoing yes, one would use estimated 6500 deaths. one talking protests? uptick cases began 2 weeks protests states. contact trace 1500 people day? 

Or states case, contact trace 9000 people per day? Problem solved: sail USNS Mercy USNS Comfort Arizona

... oh, wait.

Good luck Arizona. Sadly seems deaths gone bit AZ, right. probably worse states, older population. Still overwhelming hospital capacity though. states reopened deaths remain relatively flat.  You’re idiot. Great testing infrastructure? exactly stats availability testing numbers tests actually performed days? What’s median time testing obtaining result? ""We processing requested change cookie preferences.
This may take minutes process.""

The fuck wrong shitty websites? We’ll like Venezuela time :( ""they require masks, wear them""

I think we've found problem here...

If wear mask, idiot. one buying lame talking points attacks anymore. Give fucking rest. Trump's record pandemic response speaks itself. MAGA GOP death cult. madness Err side caution common British English honest know specified American English reality phrase sound vaguely dialectal mean December? Yup. hope hope enforcement ticketing tied driver’s license.

It painful enough, dealing repercussions, compliance easier path.

I doubt we’ll take strong move, would mean much lost loved ones this. talking someone beats kids, harasses people, uses kids pawns doesnt let family see them, screams get medication ""she's crazy loves it"".  Didnt mean everyone issues, person. 3 kids two bedroom apt. couch, row camping chairs. CPS dealing issue best can. Literally nothing said true. None. way Norway feel control spread locking much country, maybe. spread significant Sweden still, deaths down. Maybe susceptible dying Covid19 Sweden died? Maybe stricter protections elderly working? Seems like serious cases Norway imports Sweden, two hospital, Swedish temp workers exempt quarantine strange reason. Surfaces pretty low risk, virus decay quickly outdoors, OK. joke something? Trump probably takes rallies. world stop looking particular country leader anyway. Sovereign nations behave like sovereign nations. fairness, people worried murder hornets little bit ago. Everything seems able trigger fear lot people right now. Masks? Yeah blessing curse place go $50 month. curse little steep, blessing means fewer people go often crowded. required California ages people comply cities get fined. whole thing decades making US. Ooo, wild Karen natural environment. back big way time boomer mindset thinking ever heard it. Kids aren’t new human breed get cell phones middle school. Aww shit! Nothing protests?? Seems like exact time seeing cases result protests. try green plants found dude. really relax risk one spouse infecting another probably 27.7% according research, see Table 3 household secondary attacks I’m originally Cali live Toronto, now. took long time get used amount employee rights people get.

For example, You’re allowed refuse dangerous work employer can’t punish you. includes asked work place isn’t taking appropriate measures address Covid. agree. 

However painfully frustrating stereotype exists, stamping ignorance requires holistic approach education culture.

Then there’s whole ‘can’t fix stupid.’

One best friends, God love ‘em, trying intentionally catch shit. Ex-military, strong, thick-headed. kills me. 

Same guy would give house needed place stay, car needed something drive. He’s otherwise stubborn asshole, nothing going stop except maybe chunks RNA soaked fat. People ICU dropping 50 per week several weeks now, really glad got plateau early May. Flattening herd! becoming? I've said 600k year's end due people unable follow simple rules.

Had first crazy anti-mask heckler day, trying yell wearing mask. 

People fucking unhinged. sure anyone downvote post. fact Americans continue support system nauseating. Stop voting legislators support asinine system. worth pointing Monday public holiday Malta, many tests: 567 compared usual 1,000 daily tests. 

Total tests far amount 95,131 tests. REMMIXXX Yeah freedom? /s choosing stay open governors consigning states economic collapse anyway. 

*The virus:* You’re lives economic?

United States: uhhhhhh (huffs paint)

*The virus:* ok both. Clinton would contained 10,000 deaths Foxtards would labeled one America’s greatest failures. true. Many countries worked alternative approaches, social distancing, masks, actually enforcing rules prevent large gatherings mask wearing. sounds like know functioning government protect citizens. I'm always right, hell - I'm probably frequently wrong, love conversing someone also willing politely discuss. Thanks conversation! ""But asked paper testing protocols. none. tests.""

So that's bit leap. people reddit come first hand source, one exist? 

We rightly conclude remains evidence one, that's it.

""nothing said backed published study"" 

That's bold claim. doctor who's job actually read research papers alludes evidence existing, seem know opinion.

I probably agree trying say here, logic sucks. live Knoxville, maybe 10% people wearing masks. best friend lives across state line southwestern Virginia, there's mask mandate weeks. I've gone visit couple times place goes hiking even though there's mandate Virginia, actually following them. mandates mean nothing repercussions following it. Every restaurant right refuse service anyone. close means whiners win. need businesses band together ban maskless customers. Well, notice mostly referring Iran comment... actually, would worked karen. timeout lockup 48, choice fine jail time, sticker saying ""i survived night worst hotel town""  bunch lies nonsence.

Remind yourself, know nothing working labs. way understanding stuff. means believe want to.

That post mixture lies total nonsense. PCS ""needle haystack technology"" extremely powerfull technique let's detect small amounts DNA RNA. Costco Starbucks least Los Angeles Mayor Breed folded hard SF, too. got email salon stylist works SF saying they’re back open business. damn well going back least another couple months, despite fact I’m starting look like one motherfuckers spends months time wilderness.

Fuck every last one them. deserve worst happens some. sAyS DoNt wEaR MaSk CoNsTiTuTiOn Calvin's dad would say, ""It builds character!"" wish state would this. obvious people arent going right thing own, I'm tired people pulling reasons ass wear masks. Could.

Shaking hands Charlie Sheen could provide immunity also specifically saying little evidence masks prevent spread Coronavirus:

And video prefer see thinks ""social distancing"" looks like, along disavowing masks. can’t call financial support, it’s still poverty Nobody knows shit better me, tell “sir really shit” best knowledge shit. think may correct. That's special type stupid. North American PICUs, average length stay someone 30 years old covid 9.7. ages 12 30, average LOS 7.3.

Keep mind 9.7 figure *adults* placed *pediatric* ICUs. PICU beds used adult patients surge events, they’re specialized. adults taking extremely specialized ICU bed average 9.7 days, long time PICU California states built capacity March NYC spiked soon think assumed dodged worst realizing huge country like U.S., areas spike time. feel super fortunate live NY state (upstate) worst hit, Federal government least taking virus somewhat seriously. Now, areas spike, seems President party moved unlikely assist states individuals impacted. Maybe enough people get tested. States maxing test capacity again. 0% unfortunately Employers afraid shut going business. no/inadequate support small businesses finally wearing masks Sweden yet? still denying work? Fauci come said said said. still proper amount PPE people fighting battle everyone

The long short people selfish hold onto narrative makes ""right."" America bad lot countries lot big problems tried tested solutions used countries US trying fix. US one worst access healthcare developed world, one worst education systems developed world one highest case police violence developed world.

The US better Ghana Nigeria bar richest country world, can't compare richest country world poorest say fine better them. compare US comparable countries like Canada, France, Germany UK compared US massive problems ignored.

The US worst country world trying improve. actually apply financial support. smaller companies get take action even though hurts financially.

Meanwhile larger companies stores country capitulate mask rules would rather kill ""associates"" get angry phone call asshole customer. 

The sad part is, larger company could absorb hit customers would shop masks enforced. Footage actual Texas reps session discussing inflate numbers. new guidelines put two weeks ago right spikes happened. Ignore commentator, yeah crazy, information real. thought covid could still hospitalize young healthy

Yes can, put probability requiring hospitalization heavily depends age commodities. ""Death"" part primary selling point. When? also wore mets yankees hats 2000 subway googlefu weak tho, cant find better picture Wonder much working home would cut costs virus spread. university crap. I'm sorry. care Harprincetayale. university leadership witnessed even partially-successful summer term online said, ""Nope, going person fall, nyeh!!!"" crap school. lose game. future now. 

Look: state school attending, promise PROMISE state school state licking chops WAITING exodus people like ready willing take transfer student online classes, they'll best take credits make work somehow. 

It fact--a FACT--that state schools keeping quiet plans. waiting poach students other. Many ones announcing in-person fall semesters far heavily motivated football. others hedged little, saying, ""a mix online person"" mean, ""we want poach students"" 100% behind.

I'm sorry long rant. mean encouraging, actually. I'll flipping help transfer schools. I'm serious. Let know need input. come people like Goldman Sachs make messages people like? gift keeps giving Finally there's one problem one pretend disappeared... long anyway.

His supporters blame liberals. untarnished mind. Oh forever cult Trump. Nothing he's done anything greatest possible response everything bad 100% Nancy Pelosi Antifa. Well people like lose people maybe they’ll give fuck personally think big ask teachers put risk, think saw 1 10 may long term complications may never go away, seems like nobody considering teachers safety police station Gällivare open 9-15 weekdays, closed weekends. Criminals kindly asked stay away! think it’s lack patients deny care to. Oh, don’t think Trudeau open borders anytime soon. say keep closed non-essential travel 2021: qualify relief Tozo 1. I’ve lost confidence average American citizen, politicians exploit them. You’re correct it’s likely correlation minority cultures &amp; social aspects rather virus targeting non-white populations, though still may genetic predisposition involved.

I think crux “Essential Workers” - minimum wage slaves keep economy churning - likely minorities. They’re susceptible virus anyone else, much higher exposure risks due jobs. Stop measuring terms 33K dead. Measure terms GDP lost. Apparently that's language GOP speaks. really can't control young people do, enact laws consequences broken, make people think twice actions...kinda like putting kid restriction taking away phone car keys. Desantis spineless Trumpfucker. Oh, know. uncle lucky. mild symptons. wife, less lucky, worse symptoms, much, thankfully. cousin, diagnosed, felt nothing all.

You ask friend’s dad, though, grave feeling. know think examples speak but...

Smoking inside problem years. There's minimal enforcement happen.

And also answering question. repeating question back attached different scenarios. It’s highly politicized, that’s why. Wearing mask equates freedoms consistory mal rights taken away. Also folks refuse wear masks don’t care health safety others. Also, political leaders aren’t establishing consequences wearing mask, adds fuel flame. It’s mess:/ Exactly, way loans children. negative rule here, positive died probable cause COVID-19

I mean long term sick die pneumonia kind immune system could even fight yeast anymore. 4 months late governor’s mask looks awesome! wonder reverse side still beaver... That’s didn’t u/DonatellaVerpsyche talk apologize seems obvious stupid can’t send healthier overflow patients neighboring states? Load corona bus ship Oklahoma. work Math teacher (a self-professed ""numbers guy"") claims we're 1% population that's crazy...I want ask 1% 330 million is...and he's comfortable *number* deaths long loves one them. Absolutely, humidity especially effects even scientists studying airborne transmission surprised by. Literally 26 year old girl tested positive 3 weeks ago come restaurant 3 people thinking totally okay. “doctors note” saying clear symptoms? pissed asked leave. Like discriminating lmfao. Fucking entitled pricks states infuriating. railing masks. coverage heard said medical grade masks needed hospital workers shortage, requiring PPE go health care workers.

Anyone still making argument wearing masks using excuse can. I’ll wear still reserve right bitch moan like child bubonic plague, presumably. took quote many articles google it

Churchill openly racist. Another quote, regards Chinese people:

Wtf true :( waiting 3 hours I'm pretty sure oxygen levels non existant point. blood filled CO2 I've re-breathing probably pass away. government wants, sheeple!

Now excuse panic attack (in mask) repairs can't afford! means it’s 10,33% positive tests. Isn’t great news?

It's good news sure. GREAT news would faster decline number, hey going right direction something happy about. Yes lets open small enclosed places mask usage almost impossible..... don’t know downvoted, special ed kids really struggling. know kids it’s tough special ed kids. got son chromebook school we’ve learning well stuff amazon. It’s tough decision either way. Ah yes, trusted source medical advice guidance global pandemic - Alex Jones. people stay home get hit cars, accidents driving working (no drunk driving drink home), death rate without die pandemic lower normal. can’t negotiate middle ground virus. hadn’t done half assed job locking first time could actually getting back normal instead starting square one. good lord want gamble lives. click man, want tasty clicks I’m nurse covid icu cannot understand people believe chronic liar infectious disease experts . I've noticed either asked wear mask (or put one right entering store) workers door always thankful. assume likely get much hell customers bitching day.

I say someone wear mask unless required. I'm high risk believe big deal made be. Even think masks silly wasteful, least jerk it. Lol Interesting thought. guess makes bit sense guess common cold type coronavirus. cool study gets peer reviewed holds up. can't nice things. know zero people arms two weeks vs. two months thing. unprecedented situation, stupid think politicians crystal ball.

I think people instead applying practical judgment length. Two weeks? problem. Two months? Hard, it. year? happening, realistic option. We'll fight ground. People cover nose look like complete morons. can't think easier way tell everyone around ""I'm idiot"" Again, American women disproportionate amount pressure. established literature invite research. parties allowed protest happen. one shut free economy protestors. 

Mask science particular party. bet tips terrible. *Scratches baws* - seat I'll tell ya story life got flipped, turned upside assumes COVID spreads contact surfaces breathing in. never good evidence that. Given fast spread China, always seemed dubious. isn’t lot evidence spread child child child adult.

At least Ontario put cap class sizes 15. Saskatchewan told operate normal, due government funding (or lack of), back talking shoving 30+ kids classroom don’t want hire new teachers.

No masks allowed school, too. was, too. Someone explained market economy linked different. economy shitter, affect (non-amazon) retail. lots areas stock market unaffected, discretionary spending. 

that said... linked, economy goes deep ENOUGH shitter... broadly affect market. Hah, agree disagreement! Denmark amazingly well crisis. performed exactly one thinks state following Nordic Model would perform. A+ imo. Ehhhhh there’s 200 varieties common cold across couple classes virus.  many died? think thats important question media purposefully raising increase level controversy scary high numbers wife returns work today Early Childhood Education. reduced 25% capacity students following guidelines masks, spacing, checks, etc.

I seen tons reports bars, restaurants, etc, little day care centers opened. large issues centers, CDC guidelines holding keep outbreaks bay types environments? No, near 20k think one needs get plane vacation right now

Glad we've got clear us. Cloth Masks impenetrable virus shield think are. Especially gathered thousands screaming projecting voice insurance companies pay it. countries worse death rate US rich what?!?!? SHUT DOWN! least logical people stay fuck home instead work for/serve inconsiderate assholes. Let em go scream street. Deadly disease, spreads rapidly, cases rising again. Easy decision. Vitamin counter, need prescription. 
50,000 IU 50 cents.

That ~100x recommended daily allowance. take much w/o directed doctor.  Mountainside business partner caught COVID even trying support proper mask use early June. mean get sue Mountainside?

Heavy breathing indoors makes easy recipe transmission. Wiping machines frequently predominantly airborne virus helping patrons kept taking masks even county order wear in-doors. could UK nightingale hospitals repurpose sports arenas etc relies sporting arenas closed.

Plus nightingale hospitals took joint effort lot planning. Alot less need critical care, chances ending ICU proportional age chances death are. guys gonna google cus hand can't arsed find read study think English cases 1% 45's need hospitalised 5% (or maybe 10% can't fully remember) 1% need intubated. pretty far towards achieving herd immunity.

This true.

Herd immunity requires something like 70 80% population infected recovered.

quick napkin math:

Sweden population: ~10,200,000
Sweden infected: ~67,667 
Sweden % infected: ~0.6634019607843138%

I really suck math, even I'm factor 10 Sweden still far even thinking herd immunity. late. entitled, selfish fucks planet. knew money public beaches!!! Wall Street new target now. time. Netherlands death rate almost US sensitivity local timing mismanaged whole time. state population centers got hit instituted stay home order every county. meant areas virus yet form foothold shut onset spread delayed 

And we're opening back virus active locales people absolutely compliance. didn’t. usually don’t keep news, much used to. still commuting work NYC mid March. Went college basketball game record attendance early March (no one wearing masks time). started getting bad, took precautions wear mask. thought would like Italy, March-late May/early June. things getting control “new normal”. I’m planning go much, except mental health breaks. confirm. I’ve seen many servers kitchen staff come work flu. honestly can’t afford call out. Leave then, like us value presence ‘maskholes?’ need term... Yes. problem time “today” “over weeks”. grocery stores? thing. It’s tough choose sending em’ back paying rent..... True Okay, go eat croissants go back minding business. Good luck, return trip they’re letting anyone US in!! briefings fantastic. shame stopped. new virus take number wait line. We're full. know history, also know courts held cingress could this, thst Linciln acted illegally took action.

Lincoln violated constitution order accomplish goal suppressing seditious dangerous elements. later congress retroactively indemnified actions thst actions brought line constitution,

We could use lincoln now. Instead......... changing rapidly. Three weeks ago mask wearing grocery store (suburban Atlanta) 30%. Last weekend 60%. People getting message, changing behavior. ""For Americans remain uninsured, the CARES Act includes funding pay providers treating uninsured. Currently, HHS plans reimburse providers Covid-19 care uninsured population Medicare rates would prohibit providers billing uninsured individuals difference cost."" Kansans must wear masks stores shops, restaurants, situation social distancing 6 feet cannot maintained, including outside. 

If guidance masks earlier, perhaps higher office that's supposed keep Americans safe. 

If only. going bad wildfire year, going bad hurricane year. truly believe trying kill us. ties Putin China. good poker face. reelection happen , watch. plays tweets seperation games first break society keep distracted. economy cover up. much better chance happening.

If Banksters get behind it... man, start talking ""leaders"" turning things requirements. already shit. ineffective. would better never mandatory shit. right covid wont stop spreading own. cant stop never could. drag out. think sold bunch it. 35 crowd area seems wear masks consistently everybody else area. every country fight prevent wave wave, sweden not.

Every country includes Norway Denmark. source banning military travel states? havent heard all. California high numbers, still less 10% pos rate vs Arizona highest pos rate country- CA varies significantly county county (big state geographically population-wise) places worst numbers major bases. 

Basically could understand maybe travel parts CA, they're ignoring Texas AZ. numbers make sense. dont time right look up, easy say true. comes next August 1st see people losing homes, vehicles, etc. also see 200,000 dead early fall rather winter like scientists initially thought. last point depends end goal. end goal waiting kind vaccine closing country goal yes bad want increase immunity cases good. 

Although early say strategy better one. Especially second wave comes fall/winter like scientist seem believe.

The immunity thing likely alot higher aswell. study 200 people Stockholm mild symptoms discovered 30% T-cell immunity covid 10% antibodies covid. also found relatives people covid also relatively high chance T-cell immunity. got sloppy writing that. meant put they. clear talking Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Oh god, clickbait probably going get downvoted again, click following article NYT (which updated morning), see California ""hot spots"" actually Northern California. LA County cases deaths *per capita* Riverside County google ""how PCR work"". say article? Really can't give people inch times like these. People fucking idiots. sent family get sick well?? none countries let people two, they'll able travel other. Maybe mass protests encouraged? actually snapped brother it. Early wanted get surgical-grade masks, going f\*\*\*ing grocery store, shortages medical personnel.

It might bit selfish wear N-95s grocery visits, think boost production due hand Market? 

Believe not, back Late January/early February, every Chinese trying get hold box N-95s evil CCP sanction it. end result production capacity jumped 100-fold weeks everybody affordable N-95s desire. society taught critical thinking ready internet. US makes active choice teach schools result. Don’t tell people Michigan. They’d really feeling like rights stripped... mean pretty darn close flu. immunity vaccines spreads 3 times easily. need controversial I'd go today werent closed. going right till closed.  Covid free STILL. Ive traveled, flew 3 times April 30 now. Shopped inside stores allowed day one. Ever home? I'd guess: Nope guaranteed. Work? I'd guess: nope guaranteed. like medicines country? Wtf read. Yeah unfortunately teach children ignorance strength, that’ll end critical thinking. United States government protect citizens collectively bargaining medicines behalf. Also United States America require price relief drugs developed using taxpayer money. deliberate features medical system, could changed point.

Basically, look Medicare Plan reform passed George w Bush, see United States government deliberately shot citizens face comes getting cheap medicines.  BLM riots caused spike - make rioting illegal ? affect issue? Ignored almost every body except take care patients patients changed lives. indoors air conditioning air currents, answer humidity south. temp feels unbearable. ones? civilians standing rights? police officers protesting held accountable actions? Might well million can’t afford United States can’t bear thought using public funds support research drug like this, falls for-profit companies since they’re for-profit get set price?

Speaking taxpayer making six figures who’s happy tax dollars get invested time. affected places except maybe California run certain group people, people vested interest reducing numbers, deliberately undercounting/miscounting/misclassifuing covid deaths. Look pneumonia death numbers compare rolling average like last 5 years. Therefore stats look good. dont wear mask others... misunderstood placement authority, still argument authority. 

You yet address arguments. Thank you. know missed that. Here’s problem, though, we’re going run argument protesting different it’s outdoors there’s little evidence spreads outdoors, applies much people wanting go beach. gets pointed out, fall back moralizing argument that’s persuasive it’s special pleading. even virus now. weird syndrome occuring - people seem recover all. Constant fever symptoms clear virus. 

Very weird. mess also predictable.

When combine American religiosity makes people feel magically protected, poor education lack scientific statistical understanding allow probably grasp happening could something it, rugged individualism makes people prioritize individual society general, terribly lackluster extremely expensive decentralized healthcare system never going get widespread testing right given profit motive, useless baby White House, always going happen here.
 
I predicted 300k August Valentine's day, we're actually better expected. never expected end May dip, we're definitely catching estimate. they’re going touch face door handle anyway, don’t see makes difference. 

I don’t think UK government lying, haven’t exactly following scientific advice either. Pretty sure I’m watching idiots freak freedom challenged mask. JR toxic af. self righteous haughty cunt. March cdc said masks nothing Semantics words mean, ""meal"" something different ""entree"" ""course"". Hell, even Happy Meal comes multiple items/dishes. consider multiple meals burger came fries soda -- separate containers. 

Absolutely one said norm spend $100 head dinner, fact, probably cities even tried option. cities real restaurant scenes, hard people unusual. ‘or else’ possible infection potential death, Americans don’t seem registering that. Presidents dont go prison... Almost every recent president killed &amp; invaded countries illegally.

Nixon committed multiple felonies. Clinton abused power.

Sure, Trumps crimes little transparent, think overestimate attentionspan US public.  1 year hes gone, one remember talk him... Unless forces people to. MIQE guidelines developed aegis Stephen A. Bustin, Professor Molecular Medicine, world-renowned expert quantitative PCR author book A-Z Quantitative PCR called “the bible qPCR.”

Noncense. Nobody calling expect you.

There ""bibles"" PCR. product systems manuals, get product. produced world, Japan, Korea, USA, Canada etc. 

The manuals always super cautious, want risk getting sued product standard. 

Thus routine systems much manual says. 

Scientists rely articles published it, manuals. 

If want know say sensitive system is, look ""bible"". test yourself, recent podcast interview Bustin points “the use arbitrary Cq cut-offs ideal, may either low (eliminating valid results) high (increasing false “positive” results).”

Oh really? made up? quote relatied anything, except wanting throw words around look fancy?

ALso ""not ideal"" mean ""it cannot done"", obviously.

What want run many cycles simple: test works. 

You run say 200 samples KNOW exactly contains (because make yourself) check system detect correctly.

If works Cq, Cq value gets high, becomes difficult distinguish real signal background, example due reactions primers fluorescent probes, hence higher probability false positives.

Yes run samples contains nothing primer probes none stuff want test. give signal know problem happening; give signal know problem.

If want test say 30 40 cycles whatever, run mixtures primer probe say 500 cycles see work anymore.

All tests limits within work, first thing determine limits.

Off course Bustin knows that; quote must context.

Furthermore: Science work like magic. like Bustin like Gandalf PCR invented it, access dark secrets. 

Nobody cares invented something; MONTHS invention comes out, hundreds people know inventor, use invention sorts new directions.

In labs, therefor, nobody cares invented machine, rare anybody knows it. People care best articles appliance machine using. 

Bustin irrelevant, fact think Gandalf PCR shows single shred understanding works works. Scratchs noggin... could be? 🤔 Staying alive much better dying? They’re helping drag rest us though. still angers me, haven’t socially distancing months selfish assholes go vacation help spread “because they’re sick this” big penis? culture unhinged individualism

Well said. Different places require different strategies. I'm going cabin weekend, county topped think 5 cases 0 deaths. think people gonna acting little bit normal probably right. Flu - Kansas, America help desk university 2 years back 1990s. complete lack skill computers otherwise really smart students amazing. ones always hurt PhD students thesis bottom backpack get open. Like...this important thing working on. Maybe store multiple places including essentially cloud based storage (everyone university least 1 Unix-based account). Man I’m Baltimore precisely one wearing masks anymore. gym reopened “mask policy” basically “masks encouraged”. I’ve twice times person mask. It’s ridiculous.  Yes. Danish culture much outdoor culture summer. Restaurants empty inside patios full. park every blocks people use them. commute mostly bicycle etc. probably less better government cultural lifestyle differences season. looking bequeaths? Yeah, don’t wear ventilator *later* Right, gotcha. misunderstood first. main concern day latest entry is, latest days report delay them.

Don't worry, evens coming days. then, look previous weeks make guess based trend. masks save us none. Black white. speaking absolutes? Like really wrong brain? masks still help fucking problem reason abandon them. Seem like person keeps getting debt never afford anything anyway. think know  He’s businessman, he’s salesman. Good business requires acknowledging reality, sales lying teeth. don’t seem get it. exponential disparity wealth occurred since 1980s decimated middle working classes traditionally make backbone country. qol continues decline. Sure rich making like bandits are... uh, 5th europe... also 5th WORLD. seen public freak-out videos people requested wear mask business? It’s worth LIFE confront sociopathic “muh rights!” asshole may may end his/her S&amp;W CCW piece. invite people inside home unless absolutely necessary. fine New England exists bro Nobody cares say though, impression virus corona family cause permanent immunity.

Np &amp; fantastic day wherever are. Probably nothing pumped drugs 5th highest deaths per capita world middle road? four countries (all Europe, believe) many times people needing life long medical care Sweden won't. California seen steady rise cases since March, yet deaths stable since April. strange. remember feds confiscating PPE orders NY, MA, hotspots? governor ask private citizens help; Pats' owners ended flying millions' worth masks China private jet labeled ""humanitarian aid"" stopped again.

We still know went (and btw, lack transparency huge wtf). best case, going stockpile case later spikes. even find N95 days? reminder predicted back february 80% worlds population get point. live city couple million, im allowed work home. get sooner later. That's like pocket change people Beverly Hills though me, way late? dinosaurs totally build pyramids! Unlikely, serious vaccine problems milder version infection itself, makes sense vaccine trying trick body thinking got infected. rare non-live vaccines like Covid candidates. According upvotes, 'Sweden good' 'attempts criticize bad' imagine bring up, people notice even come conversation, doubt many would care. Honestly, go grocery stores town, see people observing mask requests one-way signs floors. one get upset came Portland, depressing number already care protecting neighbors.

And show quarantine weeks going anywhere, well, could hold you?  Dude followed Oxford vaccine urinary tract bladder infection. We're going learn hard way, again. fiance's immunocompromised brother guys mom still refuses wear mask. honestly hate her. politicians know get reelected try that, now.

Counterpoint German: Merkel already announced she'd run another term Covid hit, basically nothing lose. Ever since measures implemented, parties polls rising. high long time. wanted another term election now, she'd get sure.

And next person party also reacted quickly virus (Markus Söder, PM Bavaria) would probably easy shot becoming chancellor stead now. said want moment.

So two people could easily become chancellor thanks relativly restrictive (esp. compared US) Corona response, say want it. exact opposite US reaction. Bc gvt track record performance. Including covid Western NC here, shit. Saw people going mask, walking right MASSIVE sign saying masks required. Completely ignore sign. refusal service. fucked. Agreed. Gambling fun disposable money. Going stock market dumb shit. get angel investors get see new tech say - crazy. even though insurance, go doctor. physical costs $900 network. get wellness check, even undress check moles, etc. Bloodwork would thousands. Again, insurance. need urgent care go one urgent clinics MAX charge ""uninsured"" people $200. accident working leather project house (large sewing awl went fingers) clinic tetanus shot, bandaged, etc like $160. We're deep south, credit cards Make production looting loophole win. that's I'm saying would expensive potentially dangerous Covid. number cases population higher lower others

5th world death rate per population.  Seriously? like doubling idea. teach danger exponential rise. It’s amazing different state running things. like Jersey isn’t opening indoor dining states Delaware getting ready host NASCAR race allow 5,000 people attend. Don’t worry, claim they’ll taking temperatures 😂🙄 #paywall GG America. get fuckin deserve Meh. Farewell crushing student loan debt. western countries saw happened China took appropriate actions. avoided Wuhan situation entirely, imposed effective lockdowns brought virus suppressed levels. Let's tar west one brush. Exactly. ppl money already don’t need Gates money would pay that? user. free lunch number people died US. said. think would end regulating would use that... billion number includes manufacture cost end year. tax payer dollars regards RnD. I’d like see total costs RnD drug thats matters contextually regards previous comment. sure mean here, countries followed social distancing guidelines well guidelines strict. opened numbers dropped lot resurgence. televised

broadway shows never ever televised Like 1500 infected one meat plant german. Realy sustainable. flood going develop massive one could completely vanish Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, Yichang Shanghai. think would cause 100 deaths? Millennials saddled student loan debt, facing two economic crashes, supporting boomers social security, rich pay fewer fewer taxes middle class keeps getting burdened taxes. 

We're putting cart horse. We're putting square wheels cart. Nice see ""Trump supporting"" states.

It seems stupidity knows political affiliation, level management, race, creed. leaders drank koolaid Ah old, ""take two separate things two different websites moosh together make dumb ass conspiracy internet points"" gag, huh? think whole lot choice. anti-lockdown protests growing throughout state, local agencies refused enforce regulations, people swarmed beaches, petitions recall began circulating. Even city huge protests lockdown. 

When certain affiliations people started vehemently arguing economy important human lives, news started showing sob stories people begging businesses reopened multiple times day every single day, hope keeping state closed, people safe, lost. That's problem along California suring this, every county whatever wants. Unfortunate Nash-villain also. confirm fucks given. goes small towns west. dinosaur outside Union Station mask! pic easily find means economies infrastructure conducive preparedness... take account massive segments population dense enough sink mercury... Remindme! 5 months went CDC try confirm it. 

I mobile, dashboard bit hard navigate. Florida infact lot excess deaths, I'ld pull laptop really dig it. 

I believe data currently June 26, already known take awhile deaths registered classified them. something get rest solid year two numbers fully in, people qualified time seed them. use PCR diagnosis. post BS pseudoscience trolling. using PCRs decades test HIV etc. 

PCRs include targetted primers bind separated strands RNA DNA, allowing Taq polymerase complete strand. separate strands start again, over, amplyfying target sequence. 

The thing is, target sequence, nothing primers polymerase amplify. way viral RNA DNA sequences present viral infection. stock market save longer. He's got tough road ahead wants get reelected, seeing even constituents tired handling virus. example mask could used improperly would worsen spread? New Yorkers weren’t proactive bc dumbfuck DeBlasio kept waiting waiting closing everything down. every bullshit excuse poor kids anywhere eat (other county’s began delivering food poor kids couldn’t we?) people needing work economy. remember pulling kids school week officially shut done. chaos, ambulances everywhere, Clorox Lysol running stock trying take kids school like good, f that. Im grateful Cuomo stepped forced DeBlasio finally shut everything realize kids get accidents get seriously ill normal times, therefore spend long stretches hospital home distanced learning? immunicompromised kids spend years unable attend school normally, arent left empty brainless non-functional husks lol know, thing society

Wtf? Wait what?! pay baby delivered ???? 


1. Girl gets raped state abortion illegal. 

2. Girl forced baby, 
3. girl forced pay 30 grand rape baby
4. . Guy raped baby deliverer hospital. Exactly. need compare Sweden countries handling social distancing guidelines well, developed countries do. Sadly, even FDR’s New Deal policies like cheap loans explicitly available POC 😞 Using pretty broad brush country 360+ million... that’s cool sake world, truly hope wrong. need one soon. someone else would get rid it, since idea it. [Pricing transparency change next kids raised. blame. Majority people died elder care, statistics elder care homes normal 1/5th die within month.

Govt: wear masks else!

People: else what?

Govt: nothing!

People: okay seeing point here. young people way less likely die way mean require critical care. Dying worst outcome wide sliding scale awful. idea UK masks too. Masks public transport none shops/workplaces makes sense. looked thought based wishful thinking... Lol things started reopening Friday, course ICU beds fine. We’ll see it’s like weeks. betting man I’d bet reopening bars Illinois exact effect it’s everywhere else tried reopen end shutting like everywhere else. live Europe, government meetings discuss phase lockdown lift process.

I found hilarious meeting, spokesperson share summary decision wearing mask You’re probably right. Especially lot spikes states loosened much earlier. got Thailand, South Korea Australia right. Finland Canada also better immediate neighbours. Delirium? 

Maybe something lack social activities, stress relief constant bombardment news world ending cannot get pharmacy, ask meds delivered. self-isolate 4 weeks local pharmacy delivered meds me. dont believe investment nothing made factors involved creation drugs. cost anything created price applied people. gold hacked walls mine, literally price sticker it. Haha. America stupid. Entitlement wear mask IL disgusting right now. people even wear masks, everywhere go. People congregate, groups children/teens place, mess going go away anytime soon many stupid people arrogant people Yes, bitch moan haircut, wearing mask infringes rights.


If like lockdowns followed restrictions closer.

If like assistance getting demand more. throw tantrums asked wear mask.

And yes, that's mostly complain about. big conspiracy make people comply follow orders.

Because guys cracked code, even Trump's still got international travel shut down. whole sector economy closed. even Republican governor's shutting things requiring masks time.


Yeah, leaders want shut everything reason. I'm Michigan mask requirement. enforcement and, anecdotally, looks like less half people public spaces wearing them. Stores told employees confront customers without masks due assaults 1 shooting death earlier, executive order passed. talking flint michigan? Scotland sexy motherfuckers! *Slaps ass* prefer jellybeans boiled hard? anything america grown relative power since 1980. realize world shifted bipolar world monopolar world 1989 right? America may going bumps right they're still undisputed global hegemon. would love see happens China america stops protecting strait Hormuz Malacca strait. It’s true testing leads cases, know feels intuitive. New York massive amounts testing 1.1% positivity rate. Arizona, Texas, Florida hovering around 12%. Also, testing do, less spreads contact tracing do. Useful shrink, defects, sudden increase demand supply chain otherwise cope with. definitely lawyer, understanding law clearly better yours. May suggest Bloody Mary? Last night's drinking binge showing through. Reciprocity listed where, cause can't find anything? I'd surprised leadership could petty crisis.

Pulmonologists say there's literally reason can't wear mask. includes Asthma. “So you’re suggesting tax break Fortune 500 companies? That’s I’m hearing”

Mitch McConnell Nice. That's nature picking choosing winners obviously losers. One benefit kids worries joining coming revolution. Manitoba really well Pallister &amp; health offical Brent Roussin rushed opening opened provincial borders Canada. cases starting double government less transparent new cases. Ahh makes sense. thought triggered downvote bots something. Thank you! remember duck cover idiocy. That's prepared. I'm otherwise extremely ignorant plans aside fail see plans made 50 years ago would implemented leaders now? AFAIK good team set wbush Obama continued nurture that. grifter came along. much important figural hoc cold war plans. uhm well Europe living 60s anymore either hear. I'd think they've seen share infection issues developed plans irrespective cold war. still sounds like weirdest logic me. originate anywhere. 

Yet always come China. 

Wet markets always source yet China half asses closing rural population poor it’s way get meat sound made immediately waking Fuck u tell everyone start wear masks seriously. Every ""confirmed"" reinfection diagnosed false positive person still shedding virus dead virus cells got detected. evidence proven reinfection whatsoever! honestly baffles wasn’t concerted effort make national push everywhere close across states could’ve big Fourth July blowout.

Really? seen incompetent, malevolent former reality TV host cosplaying POTUS, right? vile orange slug feeds attention boss ordered sow division chaos, baffled effective, measured, sober, adult response global crisis?

I mean, one hand, hear - other. C'mon. pretty much foregone conclusion day one would shitshow US. even door bathroom. I'm giving 1* Yelp!! There's research shows person personal threshold safety, change variable, they'll adjust. example: person who's serious seat belts driving safety smaller car relax little move bigger car. Or: they'll wear seat belt drive, passenger.

In addition fatigue disinformation, think we're also seeing people gravitate personal level safety. right thing calling legitimately believed ~~everyone~~ **he** pretended pandemic exist, would go away.

FTFY. exists world. OP implied eating anymore he’d happy spending 100/meal. Thats like saying enjoy taking public transport spending 1000/month bmw m5. 

Those aren’t 2 options, enjoy eating without spending 100/meal. Nobody goes fancy restaraunts time complaining price. LA county. means beaches North South LA doubly packed. Please dont give 2020 ideas. 

The last thing need antibiotic resistant bubonic plague Isn’t NY closing borders certain states? Eek! hate seeing Israel place 3 friends there! r/aboringdystopia help half trillion dollars fucking disappeared soon Trump got hands yet explain himself. think it’s pretty obvious point industries facilitate spread least essential society. live night clubs, gyms, restaurants bars closed. daycares, schools, food processing plants, courts hospitals shutdown normal operation real problem hands. need protect core industries. Also Tennessean, really fuckin don't. Okay, let's pass law prevents people going outside without mask on.

This avoid action going outside without mask on, causes harm others pandemic situation.

Parse wording however want, governments absolutely compel action. country found necessary imprison native Americans, Japanese, black people, damn near anyone wanted different points history. country passed laws deprive human beings right live. course mask laws legal, seatbelt laws.

I'm lawyer know enough know either. opinion whether laws legitimate useful conversation. Wow, he's trying super hard get reelected. it’s nice Brits open pubs July 4 honor US Independence Day! ❤️ case related protests, could smart decision. think that. nowhere day one. Hell idea government thinks tell wear pants stupid toast idiocy! Devils: “Should push mutation virus America?”

Satan: “Guys... don’t worry. retarded crazies country job us. watch.” Yep

Literally everyone saw coming. 

Politicians idiots. can’t strong arm pandemic. virus smarter us. China ! ""everyone wants test get test"" --- two months ago nit pick much, one spend flu season amusement parks (the places valid) obvious reasons (cold dark). Atlantic provinces contained COVID, example. NS 0 active cases restaurants open indoor dining long tables appropriately spaced. presidents films done better job handling far simpler problems actual one? absolutely talk raw numbers compared ratios (also, side note, near 5% sleepy brain stinks math). one tout mortality rate 0.01% vs placebo 0.02% 50% reduction mortality, they'd distribution dang near delta function. 

Also CI pretty broad. ""'No Way Prevent This,' Says Nation Regularly Happens"" Shhhhh rattling echo chamber give free stuff people  US barely even first world nation point.

people read abstract decide confidence interval bothers would extra 50%? Stockpile exponentially? Meanwhile, Myrtle Beach like ""ya'll come down"" theses companies too. shit go there. Thank actual science person. I’d rather live tyranny locks doctors speaking pandemic China tried cover Lincoln County says whites required poc keeps getting better:  least temperature check, form means nothing.  staying closed far worse? mandated Virginia weeks. People wear them, businesses enforce even local health department told people need tested. ever reason TLDR, you, friend, it. know general spread worse, obviously can't testing strategies wildly different country country. Wht know sweden protect elderly letting spread easily elderly homes.
As far healthy people affected, information tell us Sweden lot long term affected. mean air squats *aren't* adequate substitute 300 lb deads? knew? /s feel like generally non native speakers mess vowels really affect understanding much (cf different accents vowels totally different) whereas understanding London T-glottalising, L-vocalising yod coalescing accent might considerably harder aware phenomena. 
 
 
Of course I'm aware natives non natives destroy grammar English totally different ways (	although thanks moved Barcelona mine getting less less native sounding... Oops) It’s time..... Even [50% enough get reproduction rate 1 reverse spread, though. masks mandatory, people wearing them. Now, anecdotally least, even rural parts NC, 30-40% people wearing bitching moaning every second number go up. that's without actual enforcement. World: “America won’t crumble pandemic us handled well.”

USA: “Don’t doubt ability anything! watch!!” trying catch Fucking Morons US. Send troops. guys can't hold world ransom. Make give free shut down. cant capitalising people suffering anymore. grandfather died 2 weeks ago believe able make regular doctors visits. poor health 80 years old, needed fairly regular medical care well pandemic. started refused leave house, making doctors visits deemed essential. health took even dive short months. end sight pandemic lockdown, seemed opinion given taking care himself. collapsed heart attack died right outside doctors office final appointment, despite EMTs police efforts save him. go funeral service describe one bizarre depressing experiences life. Everyone’s masked can’t hug anyone shake hands anyone, you’re afraid go near plane bunch people. didn’t die directly Covid, case fortunately get live full life there’s that. let’s forget people who’ve died “indirectly” virus like him. hospitals overwhelmed, lot people going deferring much-needed health care, it’s going consequences. hell medical exemption allow kill yourself? Sounds naive stupid. Scientists speak science: know prove using well-designed, repeatable, experiments. Government health officials make recommendations based observation ""everyone else it."" 

This new virus. lot (still don't) know. Maybe would better prepared US government treated serious threat back November reports started surface... that's adminstration, health officials. Ok, kid There's also big difference National media social pressure countywide pressure. heard kind thing said people south least car south first Sunday churches cancelled next Sunday outcry even bigger places canceled sudden everybody canceled. outside right similar places requiring masks, even ones recommend masks getting negative social pressure let alone making requirement. imagine pretty soon social pressure change take whole lot cases lot full hospital bed immediate area Well, well, well.... Fake news. Headline says 88 people ""got sick"". Article says 88 people tested positive. Testing positive getting sick given. vast majority people test positive CV-19 antibodies never get sick. Frankly, shouldn’t going overseas unless it’s essential. I've weightlifting years going gym 3-5x per week coronavirus happened. Gyms remain closed way avoid touching people's bodily fluids. Everyone's sweating, everyone's breathing heavily, enough open space gyms make social distancing work. gym 3 squat racks free weights area 1/4 gym. busiest section gym. People worked months. reopen gyms people go pals hog squat rack equipment, people throw fists trust good cardio also probably helps ones chances coronavirus.

This silly. already active, probably ""good cardio"" need train much more. untrained person would need proper training regimen + many training sessions get ""decent cardio"". suggesting people expose coronavirus increase chances combating coronavirus contract it. better simply go gym risk exposure?

If really dying ""do cardio"" go run outside. need gym lmao. People serious cardio tiny gym. Yeah global pandemic apocalypse card.

... written twice? florida talking 51 new deaths biggest one-day increase far well? capacity articles always sensationalized. article: Local health authorities said official numbers bed capacity paint misleadingly bleak Though Riverside County normally offers 385 licensed ICU beds, hospitals already placed overflow patients surge-capacity beds. extra beds temporarily transitioned intensive-care usage, monitors, ventilators IV Michael Ditoro, chief operating officer Desert Regional Medical Center, said facility hit ICU-bed capacity “well prior COVID.

\#2 crazy. “*We reserve right refuse service anyone*.” 

And, again, know turned exhausting confrontations?

If I'm employee, ignore dude wearing mask serve others. yells, ask leave. ...exactly one time, polite voice, pointing sign says, ""no masks = service."" yells - calmly ask shift mngr dial cops go back pleasantly helping folks masks. 

Trying explain company's position getting shouting match even trying converse nutbags never ends well. yes, would suck life right you. natural consequences places. heard rumour Walla Walla steep fines place masked public. Whats really sad still tons people thinks fake news... I’ve sick worry pets left behind. many aren’t saved one knows there? many slowly starving death, waiting beloved human return? Human selfishness extends far beyond species. don’t care old young are, wear fucking mask stay home. It’s memaw papaw killing, it’s pets too. I’m currently Miami Houston months beginning pandemic. also recently drove across Southern U.S. return Miami. think Miami bad, you’ll shocked what’s happening southern cities. Houston, 75% people didn’t even bother putting mask inside grocery stories — would rip halfway through. Ditto Tallahassee, Mobile, etc. yes, it’s still shit show Miami. state guidelines reopening pretty good.

The problem Newsom ignored opened without state meeting guidelines. Won’t work. Humans simpler that. Modeling. politicians, cops, tv people wear masks, everyone else too. Oh man 93% capacity cases surging. Thank goodness brought information light. 

Mission accomplished. would even first place? Like.... wearing masks important, explicitly say marginalized communities skip life-saving behavior? medical professionals sub days ago declaring masks nothing public wearing them?

Keep masks on, follow social distancing guidelines, smart situation. answer first. mind. Ah, perfect, someone who's touch! Please enlighten solution. forced wear mask, pull get nice close ask question. spoke jest thank explaining :) people believe nonsense medical professionals wear frequently beyond me! least educated often biggest mouths sadly Evangelical Christians ultra orthodox jews social distancing wearing masks. religious problem there. That’s simply true. two weeks ago. NYC haven’t seen spike. like didn’t see one Memorial Day. every weekend April nice weather people crowded parks. MASSIVE protests started month ago. 
It’s clearly spreading well outdoors, least NYC. Streets like st mark’s looked like every weekend since April corresponding spike, I’m kind outrage. Indoors issue, let people fun outside.

## Abstract

## BACKGROUND

Understanding epidemiology clinical course multisystem inflammatory syndrome children (MIS-C) temporal association coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) important, given clinical public health implications syndrome.

## METHODS

We conducted targeted surveillance MIS-C March 15 May 20, 2020, pediatric health centers across United States. case definition included six criteria: serious illness leading hospitalization, age less 21 years, fever lasted least 24 hours, laboratory evidence inflammation, multisystem organ involvement, evidence infection severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), antibody testing, exposure persons Covid-19 past month. Clinicians abstracted data onto standardized forms.

## RESULTS

We report 186 patients MIS-C 26 states. median age 8.3 years, 115 patients (62%) male, 135 (73%) previously healthy, 131 (70%) positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR antibody testing, 164 (88%) hospitalized April 16, 2020. Organ-system involvement included gastrointestinal system 171 patients (92%), cardiovascular 149 (80%), hematologic 142 (76%), mucocutaneous 137 (74%), respiratory 131 (70%). median duration hospitalization 7 days (interquartile range, 4 10); 148 patients (80%) received intensive care, 37 (20%) received mechanical ventilation, 90 (48%) received vasoactive support, 4 (2%) died. Coronary-artery aneurysms (z scores ≥2.5) documented 15 patients (8%), Kawasaki’s disease–like features documented 74 (40%). patients (171 \[92%\]) elevations least four biomarkers indicating inflammation. use immunomodulating therapies common: intravenous immune globulin used 144 (77%), glucocorticoids 91 (49%), interleukin-6 1RA inhibitors 38 (20%).

## CONCLUSIONS

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome children associated SARS-CoV-2 led serious life-threatening illness previously healthy children adolescents. (Funded Centers Disease Control Prevention.) What's yours? genuinely know advise hospital prepare.

And really alarming. Didn’t bunch education system staff pass away NY March? see comments using justification open schools think lot research needed. demand federal government mandate masks school, les 15 los class. seen many district announcements going back changes? Put crack pipe get tone comment, id like remind anyone reading could fit 1000 co2 molecules, end end, *every* gap fabric typical surgical mask. O2 even smaller pass even easier. mask probably holds small fraction total lung capacity, forcing many multiples mask-full air every breath, even entire mask filled co2 still make significant portion breath take. breath take 1/2 liter (16 Oz 2 cups), pretty big mask lot empty space forcing lot lung air time. worried social pressure, wouldn’t react defensively &amp; publicly attendees. defensive public reaction definition acknowledgement negative social pressure. Certainly won’t be. go least week check mail, get 30 minutes usually. 

It’s people like coworker undoing good work we’ve done NY. people trusted doctors years

I'm sure did. There's lot mistrust doctors uneducated populations. ridiculous affect community spread. local prison county 85% infected, yet people town going around maskless still. think understand whole ""OK Karen"" thing works. Look bit use again. OK Karen. Oh ofc. ban end country clear corona. Cause shit flooding corona. ban last time needs. add another weeks reporting takes several weeks diagnosis patient die. takes time, sometimes weeks, doctors fill death certificates health officials adjudicate deaths. finally added official state tally. Death rates US 0.3%. wrecked economy that. think message can't reliably predict anyone respond virus. asymptomatic mild course, got lucky. need someone tell us things. good. believe virus, subscribed subreddit. get it. presidents appoint people lobbyists people want become lobbyists.

And unfortunately agency culture policies grounded background ideology. one settings General population public settings, grocery stores, work, social gatherings, mass gatherings, closed settings, including schools, churches, 
mosques, etc.

You need wear time, read wear public settings. "" Though Riverside County normally offers 385 licensed ICU beds, hospitals already placed overflow patients surge-capacity beds. extra beds temporarily transitioned intensive-care usage, monitors, ventilators IV pumps. "" - extra beds, misleading title. Yup. I'm covered moms insurance (for now), boyfriend insurance. he's low income pays $15 go local clinic. I'm also low income,, qualify discounted rates insurance. usually pay around $100 appointment. But...why? see post history we're Quebec - Montreal seems like real mixed bag. people wear masks entire time they're house, others give damn. least numbers going way down, whatever seems worked. 

At peak I'd say people least wore masks grocery stores stuff, seem lot relaxed. idea wife opens puts stronger/longer piece metal bridge clamps nose/under eye area better greatly reduced fogging grew 160 yr old farm house personally I’d say less 25% homes central air. Maybe another 25-50% window unit. believe central air really circulator issue question here. simply take eating. It’s honestly easiest shit world people making biggest deal it. wouldn’t caught dead restaurant right now. getting take since began March always leave 20%+ tip try help servers. don’t dine don’t worry mask. Bay Area enough illegal fireworks every night last us while. planning bbq girlfriend friend evening relaxing home beers, white claws Disney plus. watching site keep getting red. I’m saying watched video new federal guidelines calling headache covid. testing required. hospitals get thousands dollars reporting case. point books cooked. It’s uncommon icu’s fill bed space expand contract hospitals. late. Arizona state government worried unemployment numbers testing numbers. governor hopes see trend week two weeks clearly know it'll take 2 weeks begin affect positive cases that's people socially distance didn’t even read that. public health organization says something knowing evidentiary basis statement, characterization ""lie"" fair. also look percent tests return posative results, going would suggest number tests preformed relative number people witg coronavirus decreasing. FB? social media? credit records?

DO FUCKING PHONE?

Yes, already tracked. Wake fuck up. I’m getting vaccine right away. main concern far list get dose.  feel sorry man. 50 people still lot indoors lmoa Hi there, already posted taking repost. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* fact income required group responsible pushing economy attainable clear evidence money hands lower middle class people would boon economy number spenders increases. Alright, set aside talk top requirements, since whether people think works comes political beliefs [data I'm sure covid possible stop US due attitude people country, definitely possible stop. We've got plenty examples countries successfully controlled virus, like New Zealand, Taiwan, Hong Kong. New Zealand strict lockdown early, Taiwan Hong Kong extremely high compliance mask wearing, effective track trace system. political economic environment US makes New Zealand style approach impractical, could definitely get control US widespread mask wearing, effective track trace system, temporary reduction high risk activities like indoor dining restaurants. Whether people actually pretend everything fine go back ""normal"" remains seen unfortunately. Yes, compared death trends: yes, accounts lag

It's surprise sub switched caring deaths caring total cases one-off examples young person complications. cause mass hysteria there.  relying government whatever vaccine comes needs tested safety effectiveness. However, right FDA government care scientifically showing effectiveness safety, headlines potential money political points scored. look anti-body tests come out, utter garbage best still significant error rates. Yeah see that, around 670 covid19 patients ICU moment 300 April. places 50% ICU capacity without covid patients. Arizona that's like 800 beds remaining buffer.

Seems like efficient managing number beds prior covid19, worst would be.

Thanks additional insight. Zuckerberg, sure. Honestly get it. I'm huge individualism. I'm one lib*rtarian people know. hate government forcing people things. one founding tenet philosophies people step right thing. do. know? people government step evil thing enforce order public health emergency people won't. 'no evidence person person transmission' scientific term ""we done experiment well-designed peer-reviewed"". Unfortunately general public take ""it transmitted among humans"", take ""China lied"" based Yes, said ""racism **bad behavior**""

Tegnell anything racism. might inspire act like comes masks. Remember people actually tattooed face. And, like said, idiots everywhere. Bingo. Look true covid patients general, I'm talking ones actually sick hospital. Straight doc family/friends nurses know even ICU units covid patients kept seperate. Obesity, health related issues underlying trouble, heavy smokers respiratory illness general wallop, number tell first hand Broward Health here. cop died recently, comes heath issues, weight, blood pressure, heart medication etc. actually re-assigned office duty street due that. miniscule % truly healthy.

Was glad go back gym, people realize mentally physically. felt like utter shit even trying workout home run, friends, like depression set super fast everything changed. like routine weights, 4 weeks later feel incredible again. Tracking cals protein, already lifting Feb/March. 

At gym, I'm 38, anything larger group people 50-70+ range. know, ones worried this, studies already shown even less risky already actually healthy.

We wear mask though, that's enforced fined (code enforcement random checks). people proactive disinfecting cleaning machines weights. There's even bunch disinfectant bottles grab walk own. Believe me, mask royally sucks working breathing harder, I'll gladly wear able workout. people annoyed like told one chick glad gym open. 

Hilarious thing though, going LA gyms shutdown. could read thousands comments pages people glad ""we need gyms"" ""gyms bad"", meanwhile pictures looked like sit couch day eat 10 bags potatoe chips lol. ""I know people go gym anyway, there's point, understand it...."" said chick looked like lift 10lbs looked like never set foot within 20ft gym life. think already past point. means unmitigated spread, like January-March. Add one month young folks adding one extra month school year cutting summer well. loss one month. high school kids would graduate accelerate courses. Colleges go 5 times faster high school anyway. talking wife that, late February knew whole world would shut down. can’t even begin think month 2 future everything air. Hard believe months ago people hoarding toilet paper cases arms everything 100 percent normal again. I'm afraid that's cycle going forever stuck in. Like Arizona governor shut gyms, bars, clubs, pools 30 days. cities also finally mandated masks anout week half ago. Hopefully help numbers out. instead looking thinking ""ok, looking better. Let's keep doing"", everyone think ""sweet, less deaths month last month everything control. Let's go hit clubs!"" repeat like again. Gardening really learning curve. plants I've ever grown orchids. 

My poor tomatoes
They can't even come zucchini EVERYWHERE certainly entitled internet experience mine. They're different. 

I student, charge Faculty Research major university 1992-1995, NeXT, Sun Sparc, even Silicon Graphics workstations. computer network symposiums, Friday night pizza parties, would called ""LAN parties"" today, sub-domains exchange cool ideas peers. sysadmins complete total control environments. 

We widely use ICQ IRC, types chats built VAX/VMX, NeXTStep Sparc. own. 

There perverts could see, plenty nerds pirates. Working university pretty careful downloaded. published sites could grab programs wrote, one staff ended founder TUCOWS. one guy make fake IDs $2,000 HP flatbed scanner Photoshop. limit worst saw. 

There entirely ""public/commercial"" internet spawned well, creating things like ICQ, AOL, etc. seems aligned experience. know move? dont get visa work permit, Europe welcomes refugee. throw away passport tell antarctica, north korea, like, anything gold, Delheru, I'd send way. great post. Screw idiots think always party's fault. Nowadays live houses bunch cars typical case-- houses live cost $800k-1M usually house tons people 2 3 generations share ridiculous mortgage, upkeep, property tax etc.

No way cops going trouble running plates 5 cars seeing they're registered location, several times block. hepa furnace filters - used. Oh wow, ventured Target first time since February two weeks ago, wasn’t happy saw. probably 30% people wearing masks. I’ve missed going town, decided stock meat Sam’s Club go grocery stores now. TBH since March people terrible. Snobby, entitled, rude workers other.

Pandemic brought people normally take families. also don’t believe it’s highly contagious. someone warehouse caught cold, everyone would get eventually. 5 people brothers job tested positive hundreds employees even positive ones symptoms. boyfriends sister got sick stayed home family never got infected, cold I’m sure least one would gotten sick too. I’m saying isn’t there, really don’t believe it’s told is. was, people would gotten everyone sick everyone would felt didn’t. scared something like risk dangers every day anyway.

Don’t get wrong, I’m still going masses always wear mask to, spending months absolutely terrified, starting little skeptical this. remember reading doctor specific subreddit (might ask doctors, might something else) months back, posed question basically (and know memory vague here!!) ""At point required sacrifice without proper PPE?"" Maybe exact question remember thread vibe much that. 

If anyone remembers it, please link LOL. telling dude side dumb question even pose, reminded chilling way much take healthcare workers granted. prove anything. remain wrong. Yeah nothing aggressive this. aggressive one hot minute soon sign improvement appeared, everything abandoned. DuuuH!!! random date select.

(link dead btw) thank idiots piled Harper’s bar Lansing.  could let grandma die, economy take hit, wear lib mask. suppose likely? Well average know, conservatively, 100 people? 3 - 4 million people would need get ~63% us know someone caught it. roughly 10M cases I'd say healthy majority US citizens known someone infected. Based things going, sadly seems good chance we'll hit number coming months. Hopefully starts happen many freedom loving daredevils change minds, I'm optimistic. 100,000 cases day, CFR 1%, gives 9/11-equivalent twice week. went hardware store free masks door already one.

We good supply masks March now. isn’t availability issue though, it’s bureaucratic issue. one stopping anyone home. 

You don;'t work front people count towards health. best avoid adults. cafeteria workers chatting close quarters wearing masks. Faculty meetings online only. One adult per classroom. Kids eat classroom go recess one class time. friends mother owns company makes costumes broadway. around 50 employees. unemployment ending employees going hurting bad. It’s real shame. preserve life. NY again. Oh no...... virus, respond politics, treat it. scientist crack code tight deadline, healthcare workers help people recover society working team. Bruh, finding vaccine past diseases took ages. 2020, scientist must another level around world. infection rate high, there’s 500,000 deaths span 6 months. gonna fastest vaccine made history countries researching experimenting, they’re close, it’ll go testing approval mass adoption.

If wearing mask allows looser lockdown, complainers need humbleness wear minor discomfort public. Masks 100% protective… certainly better wearing mask.

I mean, used gang, ninja, rave affiliated. Musicians wear masks. style comfort way LOL.

Cases surging face masks aren’t required.. people understand prevent it, won’t laws enforcing/fining like Miami ($500 fine). Countries everyone wore masks saw cover rates 100 times lower projected. surged states reopened, people knew prevent, think would big deal.

Hell.. people say ""violates freedom choice"", Trump made MAGA facemasks, supporters bitching. can't even walk tenth mile. Remember take golf cart UN summit literally everyone else could walk?

He's got heart disease. lung capacity crap. refuses wear mask needs oxygen he'll suffocate one on.

He's deeply unhealthy man business leading country. costs amortized already then, they've already reaped tax benefits writing losses. Fuck them. Quit defending asshole move. Friends husband cancer ventilator right (since 6 pm Monday). He’s also sedated get zero visitors due Covid. #winning /s leave hospital see much public unmasked denial. would invalidating. Get Sachs Way miss entire argument man lol actually say that? Holy shit, helpful once. Totally agree. then, working vaccine, comes big problem convincing anti vaxxers... FREEDUMB Depends. essential workers working hours ever. family work healthcare WNY workload increase 20% past months cut backs staff due budget issues (less non essential procedures done less well visits sports physicals such) led picking lot workload instead balanced (being low income inner city health clinic always busy still is, less Medicaid pays low rate means needing book lot appointments cut people). mom went 55 hour work week nurse practitioner 70-75 hours got 15% paycut..They laid handful nurses making nurse practioners doctors work harder now. wing meals fairness blow every target knew could first 24 hours lol.   sitting around philosophically debating even there. Articles like individual stories impossible confirm serve absoutely zero purpose. live Stockholm, see people wearing masks time. norm certainly wearing one. doubt many care prefer wear mask. article even says police aware reported incidents. 

Every country issues racism xenophobia, corona pandemic not. Sweden nearly one worst ones. reason article posted handling corona virus popular. shall pass. would guess total cases/deaths number that’s circulated per 100, per million, etc. Trump elected *lead*, *read*. hope right. change 15 20 percent good sudden fucking 40? hell subbing wages? get tips. make 10 dollars hour. I'm tipping 40 percent I'm sorry upsets you. need relax outrageous things said. get upset want get upset always, amazed people’s inability ignore things don’t like. don’t care like it. believe whatever want. don’t need come asshole people disagree conspiracy theories.  I'm anti-vaxer.

But silly pretend vaccines thoroughly vetted safety population myriad health risks.

I get vaccine mass human experimentation period over. so....protests showing evidence virus transmission all......Dammit. Johnson Johnson already mass producing there's too. gamble hopefully pays off. Iran already beat us issuing warrant. canada get by, I've done years.
I think concept tipping restaurants stupid hell. feel guilted giving dumpy server money shes already making 15 hour working easiest job planet? reasons:

Deaths lag uptick cases. Remember back March clear 2 weeks behind Italy. 

Treatment COVID improved. hospitals full healthcare treat them. see hospitals full again.

Florida accused fudging numbers deaths. COVID deaths low reason pneumonia deaths high year. Keep mind early COVID deaths around world thought pneumonia. Much one example, would say around 20 videos, showcasing many houses, disappeared, like journalists talking Wuhan. Upvote. true. even read post replying to? think anti-intellectualism much pro-individualism. Americans distrust feds (rightfully so) love sticking man. partying downtown staying home, that's we're going do. Even Trump politicized entire thing I'm convinced we'd much different boat. WE, PEOPLE, elect buffoons prioritize good products ethical products. America reflection citizens. Like society history. like it, fact shouldn't, ugly is, that's us. Interesting theory.

Wait... [You guys getting PM address mail un-covered test costs to? Putting money lives disgusting matter excuse try use. 

Instead demanding people forced back work threat poverty, anyone cares demanding government step fucking job.

To say solution working class folks risk lives demanding government job pure insanity. misrepresent threat going sun right asinine. aggressive caved demands few. lag spread made people think safe. Now, everywhere. they're really sprawling, hard catch developing zucchini! really hide there. find growing end(s), know look newest female flowers. (The growing ends newest leaves flower buds coming - end vine)

I planned trellis zucchini, quickly found hard make 4 foot wide plant anything. absurd consider non-mask wearer murderer. pretty much everyone Denmark murderer definition. 

You're Strawman argument here. Denmark sourcing problem. choice prioritize health officials. instead rely lockdowns fairly strict social distancing.

The U.S. stringent social distancing/lockdowns effectively..thus need wear masks. equating wrong variables experts don’t agree, feel sure?

The people saying ""experts agree"" masks belong Trump crowd. Show conflicting evidence, would love see it. least one study showing masks effect COVID-19, effectively uninformed. one Institute Labor Economics showing masks reduce spread least 40%: http://ftp.iza.org/dp13319.pdf

This study opinion piece. careful analysis data form informed conclusion.

For final time, trying convince people masks unnecessary, part problem, stop right now. I'm calling 9,247 agree sentiment mostly, corporations composed people though it’s always line say nothing you’re touch say something you’re exploiting. Damned either route. don’t mind companies tipping hat we’re going through. president refuses wear mask. people believe next god believe everything says. Well, got 10 upvotes rn Well true, see countries flipping fuck soon see first handful cases. know bad get, know it’s better proactive sparks vs reactive outright fire. bigger grows harder contain, we’re unfortunately learning hard way right would they? trying make point, much easier cherry pick anectodal evidence. I'm new construction plumber working large residential complex San Francisco. disruptive think constantly close reopen schools?

In town, Boys Girls Club runs summer program. opened June 10, allowed resume. They've already shut three times since due staff member becoming diagnosed covid. less month, they've closed THREE TIMES. that's many, many fewer people would school building. Yeah abused others left out. Money people want. Pay stay closed things settle down. responsible Reopen. ""The paper also found that, greater social distancing, COVID case growth slowed cities protests would expected — **but statistically significant amount**. may **other explanations trends**, study’s authors note. Overall, though, say data show resurgence coronavirus cases can’t pinned **entirely** protests.""

As said before, one many factors caused thing swing back. 

Just racism bad mean gathering thousands people pandemic magically slow disease COVID woke something. true. im indiana. actually found isnt spike indiana like whole country overall, thank god here. hate going supporting local business, going pay $500,000 hospital bill? No. Goodness that's sad. hand medical community rather complicit outright lying American public love money. 

If people honest crisis beginning honest many problems past would reason distrust people now. freedumbs! Chinese 5G! ain't gonna let Bill Gates microchip me!!11 /raaaaaaaage!!!1111 American Academy Pediatrics multitudes regarded scientifically WebMD. Get data reputable scientists experts. 

No one wants send kids school act business usual. Masks middle school above, face shields teachers, thorough cleaning social distancing much possible. 

The CDC pretty useless pandemic low funding. keep late adopt recent research. 

Coronavirus serious deadly. cause illness death kids, even close level childhood diseases. die RSV far. Chickenpox higher death rate vaccine.

Be willing follow science leads, even confirm bias. advocate schools close think right thing then. time go back safety measures. Dr. Fauci trying fearmonger. guy wrong predictions hard find credible.... Due lack compliance, imagine unfortunately Since FL called bay area? Never made claim. ad hominems make smarter. rate, many us ""sensitized"" loved ones/friends fall ill. meaning real us country, late. I'm angry reopen? problem. Important note ""masks"" would help prevent getting it. referred respirators rather masks typically much less comfortable require extra steps/care seal ensure nothing gets in. lol.....um NO! protests cause spread, people close chanting loudly (spraying droplets) virus spreads. play semantics games want, idea people chose violate social distancing rules, whatever reason, going contribute spread virus intellectually dishonest best. Since you’re outside E.U. won’t get job anyway jobs go E.U. citizens first. don’t degree, automatically don’t qualify all. dick, reality. non-EU citizens jump lot hoops. Europe doesn’t want non-European citizens. say accept immigrants, that’s really case. country opening up, steadily, various ways past 2 months.

This resulted constantly declining death rate.

To point now, 2 months various lockdown protests partial reopenings, 1 month massive chaos BLM protests proper, fuller reopenings say USA reporting lowest daily death figures since March.

What people sudden heart attacks strokes Covid? uptick past month? ""Close things"" happens case spread gets control. Right becoming obvious bars probably major source spread pretty much everywhere latest surge cases. fact matter allow bars continue spreading disease case count get high enough need shut even important industries like elective healthcare procedures, manufacturing, schools, daycares, etc. schools daycares close fuck entire economy since many parents(like myself) need childcare continue able work(even working home). 

I business owner feel bad bar restaurant owners workers, god damned allow fuck business livelihood kept open let spread virus point kid's daycare close given impossible task watching small child also trying run business offices closed operations severely disrupted shutdown. Fuck that. important parts economy bars restaurants makes sense put jeopardy lack fortitude close kinds places know spreading virus. hur dur, team dummies fact tell take mask note pen makes annoying district funds able kind busing, that's great. smaller areas like district, they're severely underfunded, kids K-12 ride bus (it makes circuit schools drop-off/pickup). They're crammed three, sometimes even four seat, end nearly 100 kids bus.

There buses. drivers. Nobody wants drive pay terrible job is. kids end riding bus well hour day buses many kids pick up. 

It's pretty, see realistic way ""fix"" this, even without COVID adding it. Social distancing? Hell, I'd settle *functional* point.  Even places open idiots public. pay taxes reason. much world governments spend defense vs healthcare housing? Ad hominem attacks get nowhere, son. think mask efficacy makes sense need lot samples countries got right, countries fucked up, countries mixture both.

But asymptomatic cases really involves testing people asymptomatic spending money running labs imaging.

I feel like least see way studies Wuhan Italy. statistics number people develop PTSD intensive care really shocking. mental health services country gearing get ready new wave patients virus. 

It's thing people talk much, ICU, ventilator and/or coma, traumatic experiences take long time recover mentally. lol Swedish: pull identity politics card. Ok, saying foreginer moves Sweden lot swedish friends reads lot Sweden learns lot Sweden NEVER opinion Swedish Danish history? ethnic Swedes born Sweden one else, rigth? Welp, shows mentality clearly. 

Plenty Swedish Defense Force crowing article meaning Sweden's corona crisis caused Denmark. Well, 94% humans. little complicated infect volunteers Corona virus, little complicated verify effectiveness humans. weird thing mad That's great news. got show scarf collection. 2 weeks?!

“Thank tested Florida. two weeks ventilator test confirms corona. you’re not... you’ll probably fine...” Here's preprint, says 1 people using gym tested positive: find AZ. Mask protects others. you. wore mask time contracted virus, would help them. Go go Darwin Dummy Eradication Device! Yeah, gave pressure ignorant public upset ship taking covid patients NYC's hospitals getting crowded.  even easier wear neither call bullshit is. Hi there! stopped following coronavirus closely two months ago causing severe anxiety. Obviously follow rules, stopped reading it. feel loop. someone please help understand seeing surge cases, decline deaths? thoughts implications that? Seems like devastating worrisome many infections still seeing surge deaths. already said infection probably 10x tested positive, people never sick enough seek medical help, it’s possible that’s daily cases is400k+ much lower hospitalization death rate. Don’t mean intelligence test? Pretty sure would score high stupidity test people wait lines receive COVID results... see Florida Man made local healthcare administration. types things breeding much distrust within American society. hard keep watching. Don’t worry. We’ll lockdown August again. I'm kind wondering I'm better restricting take pizza. seems one food one touch. comes oven, goes box right mouth. could even request unsliced even want knife touching slice home. Best Upvote back Upvote likely saying media probably pretending jump 5 cases ten ""outbreak"" ignoring New York gov killed 1,617 people per 1m Texas gov 82 per 1m

Maybe media stopped pretending NY done amazing Texas sucks, might apt believe beach safe all?

Providing maintain six minute time distance. California knows party. Yosemite erupting would icing cake! Nice current masks available protect people, wearer. Lol bringing managers owner completely ignored saying sounded like quitting essential fired voting system corrupt.  gotta remember didn’t actually win popular vote Yeah, around time attended event 100 person choir sang unmasked.

Love conundrum tell loved ones longer continue stupid longer go without seeing 🙃 Wasn’t Pence photo op newly reopened restaurant without mask recently? We're day 32 protests Seattle, one first cities really kick off. There's absolutely time see impacts. 

Texas spiking while, starting show impacts protesters. me, reads Texas becoming saturated virus spreading significantly places able before. Ok, makes easier understand.

Surgical masks shall recommended everywhere else less people.  using example. I've actually online Swedish classes though stopped lost job (german easier learn got German comic books whole back like try read them).

You asshole know. want live think could proud call Swedish German way I'm *not* proud call American.

I aware specific requirements said **""in country laws""**. looked ancestors sides came US 1700s. know want live somewhere Europe. Also many tourism jobs looked hire people fluent native language speak English. Wait, let's see... Stretch entire year... math... would mean... Hmm... Fifteen times worse! president know flu that's 15 times deadlier ""just bad flu year""? Maybe libruls distracting Covid hoax, could concentrate solving new mystery flu! think stupid...trust gut.

There's really two tests: 1) everyone coming taken steps avoid contracting virus first place? 2) situation allow reduce risk transmission (outdoors, physical distancing, mask wearing, etc.).

If feel good everyone coming taken steps avoid it, feel good situation set reduce transmission, feel good it. explanation context? Well least Mickey Minnie feel relieved! Waiting Eastern Oregonians start screaming breaking rest state Yes NJ far worst state union, absolute garbage dump. waste time coming good person. California ranks 30th cases per capita 19th tests per capita United States.

I'm sure qualifies total failure. Absolutely. included also. Sorry, incredibly ignorant history epidemiology claiming decline cannot reverse become increase within couple weeks. right doubt reddit agree you. thing is, bias twists perception past was. WHO, major countries including mine (India) endorsed mask usage. might many reasons this, primarily shortage mask ppe kits well notion common home made masks enough stop virus particles. proven wrong time mean lied malacious intent.

People really believe business put shit matter what. Thanks captain obvious However, taking account available studies evaluating pre- asymptomatic transmission, growing compendium observational evidence use masks general 
public several countries, individual values preferences, well difficulty physical distancing many contexts, updated guidance advise prevent COVID-19 transmission effectively areas community transmission, governments encourage 
general public wear masks specific situations settings part comprehensive approach suppress 
SARS-CoV-2 transmission (Table 2).

This appears state recommending general mask wearing. corp literally handing masks people people still refusing them.

We add 10 bucks bill too. Yeah definitely see lot among friends acquaintances well. PA checking in. Unfortunately it’s too. non-american, wtf wrong people ""freedom""?

Wow. biggest problem is, unless reading medical journals article published (but even know best paid off, ie. Lancet) get Classic News bias spin it. Also admit changes stories virus makes wonder right left. I'm mask eat mask on? would he? He’s obviously rabid Trump fanatic. silver lining is, Covid-19 nature’s way “thinning herd”... Technically, wear ventilator. ventilator wears you. dunno. Based I've seen about, putting mask easy. last time went store, 1/2 people wearing masks. ones wearing masks, least mask mouth nose. flip side, professional puts ventilator, lay (yes, know there's that) maybe ventilator easier. someone works schools sick cold cold September February, maybe I’m lucky, ha. Replace freedom money. masks free people would might wear them. Government make free. Funding free masks would probably cheaper paying ventilators. people get virus pass others. Yet keep reading things like ""children bring home family school!"" reason keep schools closed.  Goldman Sachs become health organization? mean I'm anti mask, wear shit, taking advice one corrupt corporations world? Oh, opposite day? see Illinois police would arrest conservatives. Easier pretend it’s problem arrest conservatives. Experts ever err side caution. medical perspective always safer lockdown, safer drive cars, etc.

That purpose political leaders, make hard decisions side caution, take risks. FL around 75% capacity hospitals.

But deep exponential growth seeing hospitals start fill current levels. Better yet put forth study swimming sewage ponds increases immunity. Put political spin whole lot people going swimming. good surgical masks buy Amazon would prevent lenses fogging? got one doctor's office April worked used weeks. adjuster could move fit nose, worked wonders me. Know masks like could buy? ventilators ended best treatment ive reading regards outdoors, they're correct. odds catching transmitting virus outdoors incredibly low. course, they're coughing/sneezing place that's different story part totally fine maskless outdoors long literally breathing somebody's neck. Yup, deserve this. I’ve never seen signs Sweden tries blame Denmark historically though. think news made headlines border issues policies. Tbh think quite silly news report. cases case study 12th, 24th March 2 April. means first two, least, could borders closed take incubation time consideration. Also 5 6 cases Norrbotten maybe test capacity limited time maybe delaying reply even more. it’s newsworthy Sweden got spread Denmark borders closed. I'm unbelievably ashamed American right now. wonder many countries hate us, blame them. 'Just leave like here!' Yeah, would, case noticed, we're trapped travel bans! Sounds like Big Ventilation would say must right, considering copies Microsoft Windows he's sold years. Fully agreed. administration runs divide uses pandemic yet another tool division. Partiers protestors. Cry river 😂 sorry far right dumb asses guess what, dgaf people die didn’t want wear mask, maybe don’t deserve live. Yeah image redneck listening black president follow suit, right   Planning &amp; responsiveness = luck?

Sigh. Big wild fires come period drought. (Dry leaves, grass). raining enough big fire won’t come quickly. small fires nothing get national coverage. last big one 2018 burned celebrities home. Riverside/IE part California Trumpy though, FYI  first link late January. second March. Kind lot happened since then. Wow insane. don’t get whole hostility towards masks thing. It’s pretty clear effective yet guys still won’t get board. Tegnell bad Trump, less crass way. 1st July date face mask mandatory Czechia countries Eurolandia issue one actually enforcing it. great they're SAYING to, actual consequences millions across states still refuse wear masks, nothing change. have, SE Asia learned ton SARS people always civically minded westerners individual minded. I’m used mask point, it’s really big deal. wore one lot shoveling yard work parents’ house last weekend hot summer day. fine. People stupid. I’m beginning think low-IQ conspiracy-addled brains vulnerable right-wing thought process every anti-mask conservative I’ve heard sounds like complete idiot. problem getting exposure common cold days, may also getting exposure covids. wish allergies qualified come kinds sources exist apart people--generally. (am sneezing right now) Honestly, mask provided free charge. That’s every shop here. provides excuse. need monetize mask wearing, add 50 cents gallon milk. Govt contracting solution humans. Still team human extinction. Tell aggressive change. Many people underestimate many people see actively young healthy underlying conditions make high risk. know many 20 &amp; 30 something people example athletes, challenging jobs, look physically healthy, conditions makes high risk complications either due medications take illness.

I also noticed lot people say things tend healthy - overweight obese, huffing puffing flight stairs, etc. Likely hypertension, pre-diabetes/diabetes. people low risk seem common delusion are.  It’s second wave. wave needs go up, down. went up, leveled bit (but still upslope), this... even more. still first wave. Fox article, expect much science they're busy making inflammatory statements. go back campus August 20th. Gonna fun semester. would find another place get news, sub continues garbage. Typhoid Maryland simple statement downvoted? investment particular narrative? Sometimes, people deep denial. can't face obvious. get covid-19 eating coronavirus-contaminated food, though.  *maybe* catch rubbing eyes burger-greasy hands eating, exceedingly lucky. thing is, *some* virus cook's hands get transferred food; then, *some* ends hands, *some* ends eye (which burning grease rubbed it). altogether, seems transmission via food rare. point herd immunity drops like rock afterwards? (shitty grade school) calculations, US hit 3m week. Meaning month done? I'll bet dollar plan becomes worthless paper printed school resumes. fair enough People could gatherings private settings mask ordinances apply. folks Florida. Chinese restaurants face suspicion aggression reopen, probably see much revenue time. 1/3 US refuse take it. State mandates necessary stamp pockets stupidity one. Perhaps could re-register car local set plates? 

Or break golden rule American rule ""muh convenience""? Noone knows yet. Perhaps take periodically. Perhaps get enough people vaccinate virus deminishes, problem immune response lasts. Nevertheless, vaccine works safe, protect months, that's still huge! Occam's Razor That's ok I'm sure trump knows keep us safe it. Perhaps, viral load article looks though referring amount virus people. I'm even sure measure described above. Karen save us  house store, landlords work totally real jobs well known feel COVID symptoms 1 day exposure Aww Poor widdle snowflake got fee fees hurt someone asked wear mask, let drop everything I’m coddle sweetheart. personal freedoms, ever recover.

I won’t tell chastise knuckle dragging mouth breather. report like petulant child know downvoted know, right. uncomfortable sounds evidence building up. happened 1918. People survived life long ailments hindered daily lives. really matter. Washington mandated people still care. ...I tell someone look low prices got months ago... don’t want science doctors tell absolutely tell living right. It’s hypocrisy best. 1. young people getting infected, smaller portion expected die. may true much longer - recent data Florida shows getting older population ( /r/Coronavirus/comments/hi3e79/covid19_surge_begins_reaching_older_more/ )

2. Greatly increased testing capturing large number milder/asymptomatic cases went un-confirmed previously, portion sick people among new cases currently smaller.

3. Better treatment - report UK said probability death 1/4th April hospitalized patients, probably due better ventilation management, anti-coagulation anti-inflammation treatments.

Deaths probably go current spread continues (it's testing leading cases, percentage tests coming back positive increasing well, spreading faster), time time get spread control things reach New York levels crisis. Unfortunately, think time now, many states squandering it. comment going age like milk apologize, ive done math completely wrong. actually 7.7% positivity rate today, 11% yesterday. Im gonna go update rest comments, cant believe I've done this.

Unfortunately neighbors boss husband tested positive Covid-19. ended hospital ventilator. day got saying bad need wear mask knew flu. Thanks putting effort showing wrong, instead dismissing belief.

I think we've learned COVID completely revamp treat flu. Thanks first person account. Covid really spiral control, one take seriously since media screaming apocalypse three months now.

I think anything wrong protecting society selfish would spread disease personal pleasure pandemic. probably like 20 million 160 million I'm certainly arguing main points. smart guy is, I'm surprised realize dumb many Americans are. maybe he's nice. It’s easy. Mistakes made start covid outbreak CDC. entire situation became “us vs them” political debate causing people pick colour instead skeptical thought.
Add misinformation campaigns bu standard anti-vaxx groups issue. 

Even actual medical research Trump referenced (as well could clue explained cause he’s dumb regard) content taken offline cause anti-Trump sentiment. medical testing also redone due this.

Politics ignored US politicians done paid for. Serving people. furthering political campaign. honestly feel like whole economy city based feeding boozing transplant 20-somethings move work tech. read guess varies disease. “experts” say it’d closer 70% covid19. 

But conclusion, nobody seems know sure would Covid Buttery males  Netherlands almost happened one part country. Many patients moved parts country, Germany. happen US well? sub c e p r p g n perfect ""heavily inaccurate"" either what’s point test get cases lower percentage means spread? suggest test wait get lower percentage would mean less cases? idiotic test more? Elephant room. 

Mass protests occurred major metros police national guard deployed force control said protests.

Media also turned Covid backseat topic protests took center stage.

Now, roughly 2 weeks people stopped taking streets, there’s spike many places hadn’t seen spikes past.

Of course linking protests spread difficult it’s like take attendance since protestors mostly young they’d likely pass someone else would get noticed. (Young people likely asymptomatic go untested)

But reason discussion frowned upon. Instead let’s get back screaming people attended bars easy targets. NYC 30% closest USA far  crazy that’s true bro. time living through. Nightmarish ,,l,,(-_-),,l,,

YOUR FRIEND DONALD CALLED SAID PRIMO RIMJOB LAST NIGHT BEHIND MOMS HOUSE.

HES READY ROUND TWO ARE. backwards, masks far effective trapping outbound droplets inbound aerosols. analogy went around Facebook bit easiest understand. Imagine guy pissing, want avoid getting piss three options.  
1: Nothing - zero help get peed on. 

2: wear pants - least pee stopped pants probably still end wet leg.  

3: wears pants - Pee contained pants, unless hug dry.  
Masks same, wear prevent spreading prevent getting. Sure guess seems like they're beating dead horse sometimes, rising top resonate people. Besides, focus tone articles, they're shitting America calling day, typically there's call action improve. Personally, see problem articles urging us better, even hits little close home sometimes. testing reduced enough make number. Sweet. added tests positive, 4k 20% understand correctly. Yea know 3 ppl work got one super minor symptoms. never would known unless tested. 50s. really weird allergy symptoms like week exposure wouldn’t surprised got well back then. month ago 

I think necessarily act dining unsafe. think restaurants non-essential stores coming safe plan follows guidelines. problem stemming 2 vectors; First subset population believes virus real and/or believes right wear mask follow guidelines outweighs greater public's health, mentality egged politicization issue. second vast majority employees places either falls subset think real give shit enforcing get paid enough get conflict bunch assholes.

It shame little bit Country showed could come together address problem. put forth effort numbers really come down, look royally managed fuck up. riots/protests various States opening seeing spike. States opening referring peoples lack restraint. seen hundreds photos/news clips large gatherings bars, pools, partying, protests, Trump rallies, etc.. obvious prevention measures taken. like fat kid Willy Wonka, help ended trouble.

I central PA area soon went 'Green' would think COVID decreed defeated. Even 90% + prevention measures essential stores stopped. Personally, dining anytime soon. places like always done great job take content that.  almost like tourists make state bad begin with.

PS: I've never seen tandem ""username checks out"" like two us do. Oi mate sound like one fokkin SWANSEA supporter ye team SHITE lad kak handed little git come right yeah. Gardening pretty cool, stuck home means there’s time it. picked bowl green beans first time yesterday, plan digging potatoes next weekend. don’t lot space, plenty people cool stuff pots grow-bags small apartment balconies small apartment rooftops. Wisconsinite here... went grocery shopping first time weeks one wearing masks. apparently 80% people say wear masks, according survey, ever see ~5%.

I get vibe people state remain unconcerned numbers much lower many states, assume it'll continue way. Instead learning states currently experiencing massive surge finally enforcing masks etc. Ill see girl might get shes little hustletrees interesting...I mean stupid. Yeah dare someone look rapidly increasing trend numbers come obvious conclusion God helps help themselves. MigHt wEll dEad

 get older develop different sense time get go barbecues summer two, really handle instead overreacting acting like that's really going affect long term happiness, top that, deciding short term nominal pleasure important people's deaths long term disabilities. Talk losing years life. life one care can't convince otherwise. making comments like going make people forget political views. think necessarily act dining unsafe. think restaurants non-essential stores coming safe plan follows guidelines. problem stemming 2 vectors; First subset population believes virus real and/or believes right wear mask follow guidelines outweighs greater public's health, mentality egged politicization issue. second vast majority employees places either falls subset think real give shit enforcing get paid enough get conflict bunch assholes.

Edit: sorry double post here, meant reply OP. 2009 flu still killed like half million yeah? Well, actually *true*, really. That's lot extrapolation going 2.7 million cases 160 million cases.


If US *actually* half population Covid-19 antibodies produced beating it, would furthest along country world regards natural herd immunity.

Sure, would come death toll, USA already that, like going away. US would one places world getting close majority population Coronavirus antibodies.

In reality though, numbers nearly high that. Even extrapolated 10x current numbers, US would 27 million, 10%, 4 months. rough napkin math, probably like 5x current numbers, falling like 5%. yet, somehow, that. diseases, too, changed people lived, thought death. anything, change live *back* ways people lived then. worst case--if there's vaccine, lasting immunity--some kind change certain. hell, even pence supports point make sense. virus care nationality. Exposure area exposure regardless nationality. flat wrong. time ""travel ban"" already knew covid escaped china. went Applebees once. implying sort person? dolphin overlords benevolent reclaim planet rightfully belongs them. Eh things pretty great pre-9/11. trace destruction America world superpower Newt Gingrich, became politics well American citizens.  Honestly I've never heard viral load this, thought get virus replicates get sick. Getting lot interesting information education year least. thought read herd immunity starts come around 60% ish? n 

Who still listens White House says? U.S. country legit infection numbers yet we're ""the epicenter"" everyone else fudges numbers. half assed locked AZ, mattress stores ice cream shops (among million things) still allowed open “essential” businesses.

I’m still waiting someone adequately explain ice cream shops mattress stores fucking essential. ... someone vaccinated group came contact virus get sick, saving life grandmother best friend's diabetic sister.

This far likely outcome zombies. say haven’t experienced death Covid lie itself. 

Where comment replying lie get stated? present creating straw man argue against? really depends part state talking about. Tampa full transplants lot old school Floridians, ($$$). farther north go, southern becomes. Jacksonville basically southern Georgia. Parts panhandle pretty nuts, too. large swaths swampy country close big cities. said, fair share nuts, seems. probably within guides medical ethics, ever asked listen? Shame them? sure would even work. Someone shame would listened. Even brother's stem cell transplant, pizza approved list. pretty much take okay list. made fresh slice ourselves. small window contamination going straight oven box, like others said. brilliant. problem can't tell asymptomatic presymptomatic symptoms develop... presymptomatic transmission looks like asymptomatic transmission. lawsuit court ruling soon \#winning folks, looks like one get pneumonia quarantine? think pursue idea receive cease desist WWE link single healthy 31 year old got unlucky horrible case hear one time regurgitating un checked narratives? fuck wrong give ideas!  1st grader, it. assignment her. Often assignment watch video, discuss parent, write something.

That said, fifth grader everything daily zoom calls. checked make sure putting forth best effort. freedom People need strict rules put place pandemic, else destruction ones self yet still want allow fucking MTV Awards Brooklyn August. I'm flabbergasted. single day 3000 calories wipes entire week's worth deprivation. worth it. well, think meltdown _is_ grave understanding ignorant callous. Note, never said going suddenly change behavior. great idea, tied condition stay home, need go doctor, wear mask way there, attend gatherings infection passed. like think anyone positive diagnosis would already due things automatically, but.... Yep. Lazy stupid terrible combo. true, though? want de-polarize politics, isn’t right place start look side reasonable find middle ground way?

If assume side never reasonable miss opportunities build bridges.  got numbers Wikipedia article even show 14% national poverty line France 11.8% US I'm sure. many viruses (including coronavirus family) affected environmental factors humidity temperature.
 
So, perhaps effect happening, may impactful. Fauci getting grouchy Inteferon response bet. Actually it’d hospitals get run people covid, Timmy fell stairs gushing head wound unconscious might make either there’s one treat him.

Unless account handle collateral damage reasons like accidents heart attacks, 99.6% affects gets covid. real number much higher factor happens hospitals get overwhelmed. Lol. impression people going Applebee's concerned level culinary fare?  Trial virus: feel like getting point throwing hands giving containing this? gonna stop them. Especially ""if get it, get it"" Naw. Feds gonna buy put states bidding wars like medical equipment months ago like we're getting back NJ jokes once.

You fuckers like call us armpit America? Well states disease-addled even let in. Also California.. I'm completely clueless I've never heard anyone speak like never myself. Arizona really, really bad. population little 7 million, numbers get big Florida, Texas, California, gets overlooked. Yeah wealthy white Christian property owners. not, assuming everyone flew country infected higher level alert blocking country origin (this obvious). higher level alert wasn’t realized nation month later. arctic circle hit new record high temperature 100 deg F there’s lol. correct many Ohio license plates Florida past week. middle pandemic vacationing??? don’t ventilators actually decrease chances survival?  FUCKING KIDDING ME! Unfortunately don’t much offer terms suggestion. wife asthma wearing mask definitely hard her. right mask definitely helps. don’t forget folks autism issues makes putting something restrictive face unrealistic. hopefully cases far enough people follow mask policy amount risk people quite low. OSHA requires O2 lvls higher 19% workspace safe. lvls inside masks, including N95, falls 17% quickly. mention high lvls C02 persist mask, house youd immediately vacate call poison control shows us **low-prevalence environments safe gyms** probably everything else. unlikely get infected,"" explained Dr. Gordon Guyatt, professor medicine McMaster University New York Times. public still insisting state staying open? Never change, Texas. do. know won't. Post days ago broke saying Herd going help us soon enough.  California trending up, test positive rate gone 4%-6%. rise cases, catching cases via testing. Compare arizona, texas miami site, combines test rates percentages:  Where’s everyone getting cool tight face masks? mean tight like snug face, tight like “tight, bro!”

I super lame ones want one clamps face like I’ve seeing everyone else wear. Since H1N1, 2009 pandemic current circulating strains seasonal flu, may relatively mild like 2009 pandemic.
The strain different, evade immune system enough reinfect, that's need different vaccine year, exposed type influenza (H1N1) give protection severe outcome.
Even 1918 flu, older poeple less sick exposed H1N1 prior pandemic end 19th century.

It's still worrying, less new virus like coronavirus now. 

Also, ""recipe"" flu vaccines known, strain start circulate isolated, around 6 month mass produce vaccine, existing seasonal flu process.

There also class virus vaccines, one put research side try find possible vaccine start zero one start human transmission. incredible part one protest went dancing. People created space fun in, need pay bar it. incredible. Free food water, community coming together without need exchange money. That's Big Brother want happen. ""Quick, declare unlawful assembly Johnson!""

Also, outdoors, much safer indoors pandemic. Florida Man strikes again. No...i think so...but trying picture Big Foot sauna...that's essentially whenever work out. Apperently changing opinion Scientific Data arrives stupid now? Daily deaths matter recent increases number cases guarantee U.S. hot spots look like Lombard, Italy 14 days fewer. not-insignificant percentage population level hearing loss. masks present real challenge sure. Ask people speak up, maybe could also get small cheap hearing aid help. earth people like this? exactly it. They'll throw sorts arguments wear mask, really comes fact want to. course when? sh*tshow continues. 

Too bad nobody could predict this. /s Advice CDC: lot better use good test CDC test Chill dude. Go safe (and keep others safe) wearing mask keeping distance possible. That’s he’s saying. doesn’t stop seeing friends (especially online) going park.

Also, consider contacting therapist. world burning, it’s okay talk someone it. end year we'll 6 billion cases day. gonna get bad. climate change past would naturally see coming period world cooler been.

Seriously: Look small chunk, 25 mile square temperatures past 75 years.

Do look global, mushed together temperatures. temperatures conditions vary damned much draw conclusions based lumping temperatures world together taking median.  Yes truly believe that. think words could able convey got I'm sure able see point. good mentioned point bad comes respectively see human nature seems we're almost polar opposites there. live truly wanting humanity gone live wish plan children. Sounds fair we're probably going get. American living Europe whole mess, service illuminating home appreciated. Good luck stay safe. disagree. able go gym since March everything shut Bay Area, gyms open, would 100% there.
I'll wear mask, I'll sanitize every machine, even sign waiver must. 

There's certain level risk I'm willing take, favorite sport (weightlifting) safely possible something I'm willing do.

To own... either way choice continue work resistance bands, pull-up bar, running outside. there's way bench press 225 lbs home, heavy deadlifts. I've lifting 9 years would like retain muscle mass. do? Nah... came back India last returning America refreshing joyous. 1 10 positive tests? seems unlikely. know 1 10 even symptoms. fucking kidding me? plenty reports including footage inside hospitals ICU centers...has months now, saw Italy, saw New York, saw hospitals world, saw one Texas posted yesterday. widely available exactly tough find YouTube internet. 

But sure, I’ll instead blindly believe you’re girlfriend tells full scope truth. I’m sorry. can’t believe we’re go absolute lack caring many people. It’s sad society reached point. **Sorry, content available region.** still opinion least significant reason gone well gaping hole political divide US. absolutely zero unity US, one agree anything, every issue instantly politicized. matter issue is, always turned ideological tool. Coronavirus different, one agree anything people organize camps stick whatever narrative that's that.

Plus there's media distrust, part larger problem. think even need get divisive ideologically possessed media outlets today. Everything media ideological weapon, report facts, report opinions. media outlets activists organizations. disappear tomorrow, think world would benefit it. people would concerned amount obesity room..ffs nina, pinta, MF santa maria. goddamn CC Isn’t states travelers NY months ago? Man people can’t handle wear mask, going react need vent? Assuming they’re even lucid, gonna yell doctor rights? guy never gonna recover financially protests outside still spaced club. outdoors also reduces risk wearing mask still effective. They've already cut season 60 something games see breeding ground virus, faulty tests stuff.

I hope works everyone find hard. Basically. focus National Guard areas, we're good. definitely super rare exception people going gym right now. Good ya staying away others Traditionally it’s illegal come work sick far know one ever sued inadvertently passing communicable disease. (Exceptions obviously intentional hiv infection, etc.)

That may change new Covid world. know tests taken, state counted results. far test results lagging? everyone stay home, need get groceries requirements. must go safely, entitled little shits like refuse bare minimum covering mouth.

You lost parents, still feel empathy understanding others fear same? mother exposed someone tested positive. elderly slew high risk conditions. waiting hear back tests positive need fly care her. I've already lost father.

The kind short sighted idiocy proudly trotting country become abject embarrassment.

I far choice things I'd like say you. diplomatic. One bar town it. That’s easy enforce.

Are police going arrest court summons every single business town? fines aren’t high enough deter people? arrest non-compilers? enough room county jail that, especially pandemic? going able show clear every single business, every single day? 

If many businesses able operate illegally, means demand high enough many operate. means critical mass community willing disobey lockdown. impact law enforcement. Police members community, too. don’t want favorite restaurants shutting down. don’t want deal social fallout families they’re shutting every single business.

As far state police go, enough state police send every community, especially local cops don’t want comply? *You apply loan maximum amount €10,157*

That's across 4 months. €2,539p/m certainly poverty. think that's called cheese Actually Post yesterday proved spikes due parties protests. Try again. said breed like rabbits, said hated

Experts? Like NIH? Who's model one person tests positive, 15 people added model proof whatsoever justify model.
Those experts? mean 'clurmate bange' right? climate change, period done with, go small 25 mile square area area, remembering 25 mile square area desert, swamp, forest, lake, etc.

That thing NOAA want see: small area small area temperatures past 75 years debunks whole climate change nonsense. Thank you, terrible. fear long term brain damage. brain fucked right now.  Hopefully know pop blue 'tech' bubbles...  coming terms *now*? Well chances death may small never 0. Also reason people everything right probably got someone else something wrong. Wow slept OSHA cert understand science math. 

Idiots. cant even say city? cant even name hospital? humans best killing humans resources bowing morons? I’m quoting current science recommendations. fact suggest doubling tip shows cheap motherfucker. one would ever tip 44%. u meant 20. Fucjing cheapskate rate isn’t significantly reduced tens thousands people crammed cheek-to-jowl unnecessary protest. Um can't case....NYC increase infections due COVID. Hi, name Stephanie, I'm calling behalf White House covid strategy planning team. currently employed? post I’m heavily liberal viewpoints counterpost politics. Calm down. Dont worry it.  won't. allegation fired data scientist going release bunch test results early week (to get high numbers), less later, make seem like decreasing. idea true, could pulled number positive cases fairly flat growing linearly. looks like actual number positive cases going way high regardless. [Science evolves new information learned, it’s static. wear damn *Coronavirus Florida: State reports another 5,266 cases drop testing*

Real title above. no, RAKE leaves. people don’t stay home they’re sick ultimately spreading badly Here's I'm trying gain understanding. Various news organizations reporting 80%+ ICU beds filled capacity. dad mom keep arguing it. mom says ""well brother said number ICU beds COVID increased 12%"". dad says ""sure jump 10 12 beds 20% increase"". dad also claims capacity issues due number COVID cases media reporting way makes better story. understanding real fear hospital gets 90% capacity people turned away hospitals would need ICU beds can't handle capacity. dad hard time instance believing Arizona 87% beds capacity. one forced people go there. made choice enter bar own. That’s like blaming auto manufacturers every car accident results death. Must bad genes kid would call CDC. Damn! thought Africa Asia attacked swarms crop destroying locusts. Oh yeah. They're massive second spike trying really hard admit it. actually mind showing tests administered, makes hell lot difference whether friend working nursing home tested year versus tested twice week. see could fuck data randoms fun, overall think that's least skewing.

the back dating shit much worse idiotic double sided chart. put daily overall chart? make two charts....it's like trying make sure pdf download faster 56k modem anymore Eh, yes no. Federalism understands priorities common enough handled higher levels. outbreak, instance, never handled city county level. Even staunch federalists would understand can't plug sieve patching one hole. People fucking clue spouting ideas... haven’t connected obesity higher probably Fuck company, get retested asap. quote linked, don’t want read it, “We seen spikes states driven, **in part**, return patrons indoor dining establishments”

And goes talk establishments aren’t enforcing social distancing mask wearing.

I hope that’s crystal clear now. Keyword INDOORS awesome. please tell crazy people stop yelling I'm jogging without mask on. (These crazy people reason people far right refusing wear masks) late that. Multiple politicians scientists said protesting completely safe encouraged acted like there’s special exception makes virus spread. would need look Bulgaria, Germany, France Spain italy pretty much resumed normal life barely issue. Masks indoor, ramping testing capacity eventually find small local outbreaks, contact tracing low number cases, wash hands, that's it. Totally sustainable long time. almost like eating flesh 4 month old baby cried mother save brutally murdered sandwiches worth anymore.  5th europe, also 5th world look closer. every country europe, highest ongoing death rate mild downtrend. www.platz.se/coronavirus Yes know (just based looking material) credible not? 

You can't.

You make assumptions based prior knowledge... possible thinking flawed.

So really matter day choose. Lets go baby, spy 276 Exactly. Due non-existant leadership federal government, might end voluntarliy giving 2-3% life lockdown save country countries followed social distancing guidelines well

evidently not. cannot accept good intentions. pure evil wants put tiny microchips body apparently vaccine. theories far cannot believe thinking human actually believe shit O.o distinguish emerging developing countries? Seems weird long list split up. thanks. know that. lot trouble reading chart. small part confidence interval gives chance worse group 4, vast majority odds better side.

if makes feel better, tell give group 4 patients anymore. 

the article cited proves drug good, well worth money charging (though personally think government pay instead health insurance companies), especially saves money costs. gaining several points 8 point scale (which article says drug people), shortening stays increasing odds living worthwhile course treatment cheaper standard ER visits areas. wish could understand people adamant wearing masks, literally best way get society back semi normal again. Mask lockdown. Pick one. parents going refuse send kids school September? seems light fact covid may life time effects people schools inevitably outbreaks close seems like pointless risk students, teachers anyone kid may bring disease home to.  shit? Damn. thought fine. Switching ""tests administered"" people tested make positive percentage look smaller. reporting Sunday, conveniently beginning holiday week, etc. said, there's several. That’s federalism general. States, counties, municipalities US much autonomy cities elsewhere world. politicians marched tried say won’t resp new cases. They’ve even sent health experts say wouldn’t lead deaths, like masks wouldn’t help beginning. 

If don’t see problem this, feel free blissfully ignore hypocrisy bloated 'Patriotic' trash refuses listen reality plight fellow Americans. Instead, fight system purposely ignores harms people fit description American Patriot.

Helping less fortunate resulted less fortunate bettering getting involved Good Old Boys use dominate rule.

And, Patriots want that. least another military parade. Thank you, notoneoftheseven, voting AutoModerator.

Hey bud, could go central Africa Iraq want ""interesting"". need kill rest us idiotic romanticism post apocalyptic world. leadership countering message could win battle. strong leader majority could get behind listen to. 

You've got buffoon fanning flames demise $$$$$. last time vaccinated flu two days. I'm kind scared get vaccinated again. Bad bot It’s blip. infections lower again. death rate still 1/5 sweden. It’s going stay way btw. Taiwan, Vietnam, hk. sustained quite now. Sweden messed up. End story Well stupid auto mod ate comment, suffice say, agree. http://id2020.org/alliance founding partners politicians encouraged people get cram together screaming yelling....WTF u expect?! mean 3 months. people worried gonna last years.

If lasts abput 2 years, people, especially US Brazil would given 2-3% lives pandemic better visualisation factors reporting backlog 4 weeks: Masks required people still wear them. spoke sheriff (also wearing mask) shrugged said ""you pick battles"" ""my immune system handle it""

Enforcement necessary. Americans joksters! Still fighting Cigna ""out network"" ambulance ride took GF called 911 March. Shopping in-network includes emergency ambulance too?! death rate lowered would still excess deaths normal baseline, case approximately two weeks now. hope there's interstate travel that's going fuck us here. illinois basically surrounded states surging cases now. good news one wear one? Lots people southern Ontario AC. next 2 weeks we'll reaching temperatures high 90's, even 100° humidity. gets hot too, stay indoors AC. love it. gotta end racism bigotry class warfare!! also fuck redneck hicks different view me!!! That's Germany. Merkel met representatives Bundesland (state) decided together rules want apply whole country one wearing masks places like supermarkets. I'm NJ. like 5 latin restaurants near house, love communities vibrancy, unfortunately expanded parking lots huge outdoor seating people kissing hugging masks, 6 feet.... saw like 4 weeks ago, decided lockdown likely till next year. BLM protests. It’s woke virus. Also, we’re going ask people went protest contact tracing. See, spread protests. Boom. /u/regalmonkey 

How’d work out? Sure-- infected person touches front COVID-laden mask grabs door handle. I've seen happen hundreds times. 

My point [scientific wrong lying. knowing enough new virus behaves lying. absolutely right. also shut protest businesses. should! That's really insane whith scientific knowledge have, people cant access it.

I know know gave access everyone cost would go volume goes up. 

Everyone knows reason refuse it. insanity. intentional skewing referring to? there's several disagreement. 7.7 Mexico last week, wasn’t there? Hardly seems realm possibilities Yeah, that's bound happen born transition 2 generations. 97 really feel part millennial generation, definitely experiences gen Zs can't relate to.

Example: smartphone finished 12th grade Alabamian think fully subscribe this. spring could spend entire day outside wanted snowed NY. 98 degrees I'm trying time mow grass finish right gets dark. actually Ventura county one north la. square closing beaches also allowing protests tho What's concerning work better group 4. simple ""if start better end better"". Since guy president-elect, us saying he's incompetent, racist, authoritarian narcissist - faced external emergency making - essentially doom country. Part sad turned true, part wonders thought pandemic would turn different guy helm. Oh, forget imagine control states borders! Italy, Spain, France hit hard awareness grew virus strong foothold community spread. UK started Sweden's measures changed mind.

Sweden one point time fewer cases deaths Denmark, look now. Sweden isolated example country Europe time stifle spread virus, chose implement public guidelines late. stable, genius source says America great again. sure complaining about. 
/s compared statista data Europe. No, certainly high side world, worst quite margin. Best prepared =/= ability address crisis properly. 

&amp;#x200B;

USA likely one best prepared, unfortunately, whole, USA largely IGNORED directions given best qualified positions give them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets honest here, problem preparations, problems lie users system lack leadership. Even USA vaccine AHEAD TIME, significant percentage would refuse take it, majority would paying criminally large sums. found good use ventilators much beginning.

Yet redditors continue complain Sweden's elderly receiving enough intensive care, less translates ventilators. See above. specifically bars ... it’s denying science point businesses haven’t following guidelines, remain closed. We've got health department intentionally skewing numbers make look like bad. governor pretending everything open fine population believes get COVID(if real) prayer save them. How....? sit say it’s control? Either completely oblivious actually going right noses, completely utterly lying. It’s obviously latter truly fucked response literally killing people. think plague one reason ancient roman empire weakened enough barbarians persians take away territory. would everyone ideally America contain virus? takeaway everyone lucky get mild symptoms. Plus self isolate could spread community. article mean okay get sick since bad people read it. No. No. No. 

Less water. Fewer water droplets.

Less sand. Fewer grains sand.

Less glass. Fewer glass beads. 

Do see pattern? 

Fewer applies countable objects. Less applies things discrete. sympathy sympathy communities going get fucked due ignorance. Okay, I'm calling shenanigans Texas' COVID-19 death totals. Looking raw numbers (borrowed WorldOMeter USNews):

Population: 2nd 
Population Density: 32nd

Total Cases: 4th 
Cases per million: 31st 
Total Deaths: 15th 
Deaths per million: 41st

Worldwide death rate: 4.86% 
US death rate: 4.78% 
Texas death rate: 1.52%

Texas Healthcare Access Rank: 47th 
Texas Healthcare Quality Rank: 41st

&amp;#x200B;

What part numbers makes littlest bit sense? barely test (42nd), still plenty positive tests, one lowest death rates country poorest healthcare?

It makes absolutely sense. guess can't handle truth Florida alone could get us there.

They nothing cases double weekly. able stop people getting together someone house. Schools out, kids bored home, sports parents bored sitting home well. much house cleaning, house project do. lived city walking downtown outdoors always made nervous regarding Covid. think generally safe honestly avoid situations now.

I moved boonies last week love it. soul street usually, even bump others much open space.

Take care, get better soon! can't help think many cases could avoided spending money testing.

*"" The* [*Trump *has bought 500,000 doses ""*

*""The drug, invented Ebola failed work, patent Gilead, means company wealthy countries make it. cost around $3,200 per treatment six doses, according US government statement. ""*

Thats $533 dose, Gilead labs sell exact compound $60 dose... great bargaining. That's, ""The art deal"" 🤦‍♂️

Also, even though shown somewhat effective; lot's treatments. don’t need read it, Wikipedia valid citation source anything Yep new ""I give fuck attitude"" really set idea still going contain this.\\ guess question many dead people take everyone get shit together? 250K? 500K? 1M? 

We even know long term economic impact virus expect full swing end year. leaked footage pretty sure also released 1.5 hour unedited audio recording idk honest idk wants hear months ago didn’t many available tests testing people symptoms. Even symptoms weren’t guaranteed test unless symptoms severe. Young people weren’t getting tested typically don’t show severe symptoms all. widely available tests anyone get tested, young people tested frequently. Mumps fastest vaccine **ever** made. 4 years. sister’s bf’s grandfather died result Covid, yet went week long vacation Florida even month after, two 5 diff states trips throughout pandemic. Conservative nutjobs simply don’t care.

Meanwhile I’m bad guy asking get tested coming back PA, refused so. Sure, I’ll give cases isn’t probably best counting statistic. Still doesn’t change fact US 9th worse deaths / million people. number could worse weeks explosion new cases run course. wouldn’t call efforts aggressive. people know go eat, congregate groups, keep traveling, don’t wear masks unless they’re indoors around strangers. Life moving shits normal much California. CuZ sUmMEr expect read whole article? lucky even read whole title post. /s true. Please, people! Wash hands using bathroom, virus not!! would number deaths hospitalizations would go stay low infection rates going up? good. I've lived wonderful fulfilling life. empathy. won’t. Agreed, sucks see much hate gyms getting. population healthier virus would lot less severe. CIA pretty sure real. I'll side issue. ones mostly about. bet plenty believe higher power sure pass CoVID19 around church. Well, fucking helpful.

How trillions global trade going without USA right now? would know because? average age infected dropped significantly latest surge/outbreak. would partially explain drop deaths: 

Louisiana: Virginia: continually surprised Denmark contains multitude citizens. 

Just kidding, Swedish? [Just Please stop spreading this. [You kill food grocery delivery since started, wearing mask, practicing proper social distancing washing sanitizing hands frequently, 3 days ago noticed tiring easier normal waking feeling like dog sleeping chest. Last night lost sense smell taste went bed aid nyquil cough, body aches headache, dreadful. fever. us everything right get caught path tornado. I'm trying find free testing site nearby, barely making ends meet recent turn events. Found Joe Rogan's account! really think US needs looked terms state performance rather whole republic. That's true lot things. large diverse end lot noise confusing data Exactly, it’s freedom choice. one wear mask unless becomes mandatory like hospitals public transport England. someone doesn’t want wear mask well within rights so. organization knows global hunger UN’s WFP, largest hunger-fighting organization world, operating since 1962. even New York Times. Yeah people sub extreme. think balance good. obviously can’t shut world forever without causing massive harm individuals society. Encouraging masks social distancing keeping economy open allowing people socialize seems reasonable can’t spout nonsense heard Fox News? thought America! spread virus two weeks developing antibodies. wept. mean, count pandemic beginning March December vaccine means we’re 1/3 way list businesses take health importantly fighting stay open exercise, eat meal, get haircut?

I'd like able remember over. China massive lockdown 74 days still struggling contain virus 6+ months. level human-rights violations stop thing We'll start new coronavirus subreddit point since virus intrinsically tied politics US now. mods auto mods whatever remove comments there's discussion. worry always human element. Take burger example, burger assembled someone. meat hot corona free (hopefully) bread, lettuce, tomatoes, etc.... may be. someone coughs sneezes said burger? container food put may safe either. they're wearing mask, entire possible. Pizza seems safe enough me. hot oven goes right box. thing could problematic would box. tragedy could starved weeks lost weight based stored fat, heart choked fat gave stress. purposely dense? lot people fucking work. everyone work home. husband plumber. supposed work home? sure that. honestly dont think many Americans care get millions. us statistically likely dont know anyone died yet, Americans relate know. 3.6 million number think would affect Amerifans that's 1 every 100 that's likely around amount people interact socially given year. Yeah don’t act, won’t go away. mask stop gathering, social distance burn out. vaccine. point realize doesnt give fuck? I'm saying anywhere done ""a great job"".

But many people seem think USA ""the worst"", ""reacted worst"", significant chunk Europe actually suffered Covid? think sort misleading. mask protect much protects others droplets spread infected, even showing symptoms. Maybe put words might make people consider wearing mask refuse wear one now, think gives false sense security wear masks &amp; around wear masks. lot us elect wretch fighting ever since. don’t deserve this, honestly fuck you. totally get that, government can’t keep controlling us making us stay home. Everyone decide wana stay indoors rest lives, means, people wana risk 98% survival rate infection free so. Obviously staying inside half year nothing covid still sure rest time means control peoples activities continue install tracking shit phones, let everyone risk wana risk Hillary Clinton president we’d taco trucks every corner. “Complete sustained collapse” lmao. Get real bud. That’s end civilized society. Never going happen. It’s still going Maybe wouldn’t lie current administration had, dunno, planned ahead first warned possibility tossed pandemic game plan provided previous administration. turned out, weren’t even enough masks/PPE medical staff. We’ve lost hundreds medical front line personnel disease. it’s enough screwed government, fellow citizen equally fucking us refuse believe real. It’s truly tragic. think studies. Anyways, stocking N95s recently since price dropped lot , ready second wave one gets serious first one. sure hope biggest historical event life....there alot lately I'm tired shit anyone know infections surging weeks now, hospital admissions meaning increased testing, seeing increase death rate? something expect see another week two? infections mainly among younger demographic moment walking hospital again? feel like I'm waiting shoe drop solid explanations forthcoming. Unless it’s someone care it’s “wE diDN’t kNoW” recently idiots yelling louder sensible people. decided combat best way could, joining conversation, presenting data. Remember deaths trail hospitalizations 3 weeks, could see deaths spike again, devastation got nursing homes etc. first round. developing techniques treatments improving survivability.

Hope best don’t surprised spike. fucking hate Americans. We’re god damn worst. countries even want drug? one, provide housing exchange rent payment. Maybe leave property pay. I’ll go ahead add 2020 apocalypse bingo Deaths lag. Even earlier test people (with testing). advances treating sick decision based positive cases per million percentage positive tests.

Very glad Whitmer sees absolute ridiculousness happening southern southwest part country trying ensure Michigan go backwards. good mice, percentage things work mice go work humans low. 

heck, percentage low even things work primates. point ridiculous people refuse learn cook. watch YouTube video, read cookbook, ask parents. Like hard learn cook something. willing are, far I'm concerned, unforgivably lazy. Sadly, wont us selected collateral damage rest us go applebees. Haha thanks humor. would also bet another human. I’ve running lot Q, I’ve always worried could pick running past people. haven’t much interaction people, that’s guess. need 50% efficacy get pandemic!. hope get better results🤞 US rather intentionally democracy since use elective representation tend included already risking every time send kids school. flu, meningitis, strep throat, kinds deadly diseases. Oh wow don’t say approved armed forces, probably means use soldiers testing. need shut everything back down. closing hot spots enough. That's going stop people going locations still on. many deaths need happen people take seriously? Well yes. That’s point. individual reports mean much. Idiots everywhere - including Sweden. isn’t. Fauci recognized one world's leading experts infectious diseases. physician National Institutes Health (NIH), Fauci served American public health various capacities 50 years, advisor every U.S. president since Ronald Reagan. made contributions HIV/AIDS research immunodeficiencies, scientist head NIAID NIH, 1983 2002 one world's most-cited scientists scientific journals. physical presence important lot families before. Graduations, births, deaths Easter things people missed at. thousands people running around burning looting night.

The virus remarkably vulnerable far UV light gets crushed beloved son. 

At night though... last part normal people get man. really like coming sub seeing people like relate with. Sometimes gotta blow steam write long one out. wonder end august leadership capitulating minority group selfish never seen weaker leadership country entire life

I honestly feel way sides right talking percent there? dollars $12 burger? Because, opened way early, way fast. also seems catering demographic agenda. Casinos/restaurants/churches still allowed. attended Trump rally here, big parties dinner restaurants here. Time time again, press conferences, would talk needing change anything, trending right direction, even cases climbing, ICU beds dwindling. god awful leader. isn’t. sub dumb difference tax brackets capital gains tax make opinion?

Lets compare millionaire public school teacher. difference tax brackets capital gains tax make comparing two people?

This obviously first time thought subject take time need. good comparison. vast majority people could intentionally infect end ventilator. better comparison ""It's lot easier wear mask lock-down economy"". get toilet seat   march spreading around. hope masked socially distanced. Everyone protests went was. hope negative! feeling symptoms get tested check? stupid...so stupid. Thanks, it’s referenced shown slides Texas reps judge video. haven’t taken time find original. Florida outdoors right now. Heat index 100. People inside AC. suspect playing role increased spread. companies making healing compounds multi billion dollar industries? Florida here, I'm sorry. think scholarships. college set could take year keep scholarship, many don't. wonder(and haven’t looked numbers) locked early March/April low risk spread. Maybe waited surge get them, could locked once? I’m throwing there. US physically large think virus still making way through. 

Guess lot “maybes” going forward. ok, asocial media? couple people went bar nation's hotspot end testing positive equate massive spike due going bars

See argument applied anything? Great point. someone living Vancouver island Canada, can’t even imagine guys going south. isolated population island people following social distancing we’ve able reopen restaurants weeks without spike (...yet?).

I truly hope country make year without major fallout, humanitarian reasons also selfishly would prefer Americans STILL coming border closures fuck us! dangerous part day elevator hallway apartment. wear high-end respirator. 

I'm beyond caring people wear masks (many 50). Get COVID. Go ahead. worst idiots wear it, allow nostrils. idiots think it’s spreading via mouth. “What, I’m wearing mask, sheesh” Inside masks....this true. O2 smaller masks inlets. Particularly cloth masks people asked wear. CO2 also smaller. Transferance air intake O2 effect blood oxygen levels unaffected masks. 

Ok... poison control call CO2. deal poison injestion. Also believe mixing CO. Carbon dioxide....and carbon monoxide. would love know know much CO2 home. use measurement?

Even masks worn correctly 6 hours time change blood oxygen levels... means intake CO2 problem getting plenty oxygen.

Please stop spreading science falsehoods mixing terms. people die flu every year. dont shut country flu..bro

/s r/murderedbywords Would massively cheaper COVID. Everyone, leaving home without respirator 2 weeks. Disease stomped. apply restaurants? getting strict guests yet seated table, required wear masks food arrived? Da fuck kinda ""study"" this? one Rona spread? 

Thanks doc. need, already prime entertainment everyone, can't compete you. say. Surprising.

Next thing know, water declared wet! Test centers maxing past days. Im sure see 70k tests sometime week. many people get tested weekends, partly due test centers open weekends. takes 2 days. I’m day 5. tester site said results within 2 weeks. sure, long classes held outdoors masks. Indoors, distance makes ""safe"". dorms entirely frightening prospect. issue fighting logic people believe facts Older people better protected younger people go out. Grandma isnt hitting bar restaraunt. can't really hide hospilization data hospital surges though. again, sounds like problem rather explanation believe face shields less effective open vs mask, worn properly seal face, making harder aerosols get in, even cloth. normally see essential workers wearing face shields masks, usually face shield. Lol. Another ""study says"" pile fairy tale garbage. title one schools here, pretty sure feds fund it. school district getting hit big time budget cuts right tax revenue down. think they'll able scrape money together. Well keep crying y’all could completely prevented this. Shame you. Bring gamut colored masks... including bronze color.

Sell $10 pop. Everyone wins. would willing bet complaining unavailability dine-in services folks delight treating service staff like shit. quarantine able feed silly little superiority complexes without barista server belittle. rents bills due. Everyone doesn’t ability simply go work. 2nd grader go work otherwise don’t get paid? recently started sorting /r/Coronavirus new again. stopped late April early may things started calm  think funny, wait human race extinct 80 years! Great times ahead! much winning done! think us citizens decide want go drive public highways drunk gills"" That's true. non N95 mask protect much auto populates state websites, sometimes anomalies happen like NJ unloaded newly classified COVID19 deaths one day. normalized after. Thank you. will. Keep fighting good fight asshats celebrate year? #1 corona infections deaths?  City Milton??

More like City Covid19....right guys?!? amirite?!? mind people make comparison long compare accurately. accurate comparison would something along lines Dream Team versus middle school rec league team one advantage influenza type virus would lot experience dealing those. Every year influenza strains change scientists design vaccines based predictions type strains could circulate year. would far far easier quicker develop deploy vaccines based previous flu vaccine platforms developed used safely several years. 
The advantage caught major outbreak h2h transmission started. Given havoc caused current pandemic, I’m willing bet research team put together speak study develop vaccine candidate beforehand. She’s way real fictional story read haha. virus, scientists calling “G4 EA H1N1,” yet shown infect humans exhibiting “reassortment capabilities,” Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, told Senate Health, Education, Labor Pensions Committee hearing. Lee County big retirement center. Concerning. Weren’t young people driving cases Florida? education required people understand science way understand world produces (generally) reliable results.

The challenge *learning* right response COVID. (Wear mask! Maintain distance!)

The challenge people *believe* told. give up. mean? Reassortment means mix match strains flu. That's 2009 came from. know could produce here. Might relatively mild, might not. 

That lives mammals, hosted pigs (who host kinds flu) already infect humans sets alarm bells. building blocks something dangerous. Sponsored Athlean X He's skyping in. risking virus. Thanks, I’ll see ship Canada, want something snug typical flimsy ones. Well exponential growth exponential growth. know thats cases increase strict measures taken. means states allowed people mix BIG trouble. means overflowing hospitals, yes. havent already, look exponential growth get sense things headed. Additionally, NY restaurants bars weren’t open like TX covid spreading protests wouldn’t spread much NY TX simply places closed. Lol ok Gah!! live mid-Atlantic state. ☹️  Lmao. Go read Lies Teacher Told People’s history. There’s middle class dude. It’s curtains. know percentage children live poverty city? 54 percent. Where’s middle there?

You aren’t smart. think are, you’re not.  I'm not. Ever since I've little kid learned ideals founding documents seen hypocrisy contradiction. little kid obvious full shit everything is. read 1984 6th grade I'm pretty sure I've cynic since lol. mean they're cheap see not. I'm sure enterprise pricing masks seeing pack 50 disposable single ply masks Walgreens 34.99 discouraging AF stores trying model. aren’t concerts ball games allowed. Anyone knows hurricane season starts? takes least 2 days individuals get test results back, safe assume lag least 1 day. lady work got tested waited 8 business days results. muzzled politicians view intelligence science useful. guess surprised, that's crappy. definitely need leaders right thing. I'm know Cuomo made mistakes too, seems actually give shit appears trying what's right. much hope place. Almost putting people cold environment recirculated air, forcing stand next one another little safety precautions adjustments Covid-19 end getting Covid-19.

Who knew?

Well, except meat plants, thing bothering change thing.

And so, process repeats. much pro mask, think be-all end-all solution this. think, especially anti-mask crowd lurking, additional forced social distancing going way this. mom DFW waiting results test 7 days. "" Setting indoor temperature 25 ºC could decrease need social distancing containing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Cooling indoor temperature low may reason COVID-19 outbreak high air temperature countries."" 

Interesting findings. Wonder temperature data viewed year over. Good bot really insidious politicians openly killing constituents.

But, honestly, probably hurt reelection. ""If like burning sensation pee going back inside urinating condom on, hate burning sensation STD""

I think good slogan.  think agree stated state led thing  hospitals fucked regardless second wave. matter time. people love wear masks stay home, there's little chance they'll get infected people. recently blocked someone Facebook (DeLeTe PrOfIlE, know...) compared CoViD-19 common flu... got Banana Republic fairly form fitting. exactly clamp, shape Dr. Fauci's.  I'll put link reply post, since dunno store links allowed moderated away. :) case, search ""masks"" Banana Republic.

It fits well, adjustable ear thingies (make longer shorter helps tighter looser need) metal thingy nose bend shape, pocket insert want, fully machine wash/dry (although hang dry mine). got masks places try, probably favorite. Ended getting main ""mask supply"". need wish it, seeking volition. show epidemiologist opened eyes bad going I'm thankful Rogan that. prepare open schools! 

&amp;#x200B;

Great idea Thanks point OSHA give damn?? kidding. live society whoever gets emotional, matter illogical biggest voice.

If someone high risk coronavirus, stay home figure way care home. hold vulnerable people hostage.

Along sanitization, social distancing, mask-wearing. NY Good bot mean economic way, doesn’t work either it?

I dunno, mind going back to, say, 1980, top federal income tax rate 70% tuition state universities &lt;$30 credit hour. together, right? saying struck public. proven false. Yes Even testing banned cat’s bag, we’re back panic mode. It’s late control narrative. don’t love police state. think theres middle ground “police state” “no enforcement anything whatsoever” agree downvoted, provided source states exact facts making out. However, comments context wrong either. could elective surgery requiring ICU care, discount many people get hospitalized non-COVID related illnesses.

In terms mask wearing, varies even subcommunities. neighborhoods could 95%, go 5 miles another direction 60%. especially true see LA Asian American dominated communities versus others. virus turns deadly SARS-COV-2, I'm sure we'd ""it's another covid"" takes. Oh look it’s mr “you’re ruing sub” 😂😂did come cry well? turn national disaster US, even take rapid action now.

Which not... Could explain could possible? Depending citizenship. us citizen working abroad claiming us citizen residentance actually coming back us terrorizes making less (last checked) $120,000 usd u file taxes exempt paying anything 120k mark. thought going overseas contractor back 2010 war peaking willing pay 180k turn wrench hostile places Kuwait. Talk widening goal posts. know less 800,000 suicides last year? currently 533,852  Downvote shit. It’s saying there’s coronavirus community public type things. Didn’t Riverside County vote masks last month? wear N95 3M ventilator masks breathing exits 100% unfiltered one-way valve. could tape exit valve, still haven’t seen anyone that. use planes only. Every day use surgical mask places mandatory, assume fuck-all avoid people, waiting turn outside shop (as many here) stay away crowded places. Something tells aren’t biggest fans science though. taken look county state health department see actual data. looks like since quoting numbers. 

I noticed people locked 3 months arguing more, whatever reason. really want add conversation, icu beds require ventilation add another factor mix. Sorry, either join discussion avoid it. Yes, 12 beds give take big factor, much urgent discussions had. estimate best case scenario, stay home orders. I’m big politics, pandemic thought little Cuomo. He’s greedy, honestly isn’t days? thing like pandemic putting aside certain decisions made, kept us informed, repeats message daily basis: wear damn mask. much uncertainty going on, want leaders. want someone keeping us informed saying ok bad, expected peak X date, &amp; daily numbers. father hates Cuomo says he’s good media, agreed keeping us informed important. Hopefully stay way, would relief losing lethality. pretty much everyone Houston getting virus?  Good thing Plague Inc. extremely inaccurate! real life easier spread virus internationally, otherwise far harder wipe entire world disease. Plague Inc. one ever recovers, lockdowns, contact tracing programs, vaccines, mutations happen way quickly cause dramatic changes, mutations somehow impact people disease opposed affecting infected people downstream infected person occurred.

It good live world, video game. possible contain virus Plague Inc., hopefully happen virus identified pigs, unlike one identified Wuhan hospitals became overwhelmed non-flu pneumonia patients. Plus, ironically, pandemic may easiest time prevent new virus becoming another pandemic due limited international travel heightened concern. little cat butthole mouth pock marked nose. I'd buy one. can't seriously act victim soon article disputing believe true posted, believe Sweden somehow country made problems Denmark have. Sweden Denmark friendly rivalry stretches across sports international events like ESC. Anything simply making stuff up. Swedes act like they're better Danes, Danes act like they're better Swedes. trust people actually making stuff about? Christ, people upvote even blatant lies long they’re bad.

Eh, I'm going trust friend actually taking care COVID patients NYC one big hospitals peak pandemic rando general public probably never worked healthcare capacity plenty beds plenty vents. ship, field hospitals went largely unused normal hospitals able expand capacity.

Yeah, I'm going need proof here; set field hospitals separate COVID-patients non-COVID patients. know hospitals repurpose certain specialty hospitals right? expanding capacity taking NYC peds hospital putting adult patients there. Given people scared minds going hospitals outside COVID, think would make sense areas designated largely unused? make money. campaign printing masks millions handing free low-income neighborhoods and/or pretty much anywhere popular. MAGA middle die-hards, low-key American flags + subtle ""DJT"" ""Trump4Prez"" whatever corner everybody else.

His campaign [ridiculous amount money 'Rona means can't spend lot traditional things, walking talking enthusiastic billboards whatever say wear name face everywhere go?.... bother tell that's want.

Thought genius businessman? Wait till hear much universal health care would save! avoiding unnecessary indoor spaces. Personally since nightmare started indoor space I'll go grocery store. endanger vulnerable unnecessarily also I'm laying hospital bed alone dying least piece mind something essential. inability American leaders learn American states bizarre. virus complex, prevention simple. seriously don’t understand. well yeah 2 months perfect timing exponential growth become noticeable I'm expecting flare ups given relaxed things are, Ok, meantime new cases peak Tuesday number fantastic. normally recommend people take risk see friends / family, sound like recipe disaster. That's large group, indoors, probably old people, people obviously careful. Psssshhht mean AcTorZ ventilators?? /s telling people chronic PPE shortage medical staff exposed virus far average person would point. 

Take advice. That's great all, people definitely need wear masks. wearing mask keeps someone else ventilator, keep ventilator. root people wearing masks. barely got Alamo Drafthouse :(  got test palm beach county last week. Youre supposed make appointment calling phone number, called probably 30 times 2 day period one ever answered. Drove testing site, told leave without appointment make.

But.. friend clued get test CVS. Made appointment online next day, went drive thru even wait.

So trying get test Florida maybe CVS help you. count public health department whatever called. We're special. (USA). They're objective, EU national, I'd support determination too. We'll open travel .... eventually. American citizens America? stop safe country time period first? ""The UVA scientists found levels particular cytokine blood upon diagnosis could used predict later outcomes. Cytokines – proteins produced immune cells – responsible severe overreactions immune system, known cytokine storms, associated COVID-19 serious illnesses.

Interesting stuff. wonder though also catch ""long-haulers"" severe enough go hospital still excessively fatigued impacted even 3+ months illness. Oh ""MUH GOD GIVEN AIR!!"" ""MASKS KILL"" ""5G!!!"" right? There's going lot bullshitting vaccine trails. Obfuscation information norm. all, cannot ignore one vaccines race politicised certain ""leaders,"" two, business through. making America great again.

Lol, huge Black Paint Matters wall orange county Leader, literally.

It's ""Escape New York"" ""Escape Murica"", good luck Y'all :( Get load guy!  Oh no! disaster you! mean, least specific plan visit mom. wedding something else much harder reschedule. hope works somehow! It’s hilarious people actually think mask anything. need full mask shift language bizarre manipulative. sounds like wartime slogans  Mango man: ""ban testing, cases reach 0, problem solved."" Mexico one week ago I'm sorry. Hoping full recovery soon! Look tough guy antibodies  5 people I’d lean towards going 20 people? way link breakdown showing even majority drug company’s budget R&amp;D / manufacturing?

 sounds like particular drug already developed costs $10 manufacture. mods delete references ""study"".  pile garbage. mean yeah. know this. I’m talking move shit something irrefutable TL;DR - false dichotomy used instill fear facts. 

How ""fear mongering"" ""doom porn"" present two options public: ""Wear mask go ventilator""?? facts logic prove statement false. calling hoax dangerous people. facts told CDC say majority infections result mild symptoms. CDC says cases result mild symptoms. want call gamble could young die, sure, fine. ""wear mask wear ventilator."" fear mongering eating like cake. Sad seem ignorant Americans view point. Unable use basic logic reason, parrot doom porn read online. “But economy benefits ventilator sales mask sales” - many Americans governor’s thinking Needs 5 10 times higher Ok..so follow obviously correct information bitter? Many pople use shield acting like assholes, throwing finger society. many us understand compromise working others, getting everything want ok it. Maybe, employer tough - leave country quarantine. changes might plan something, provided Americans welocme anywhere then. Assuming going gym outside US:  breathe prevents droplets expell getting air surfaces. However, filter breathe *in* still breathing contaminated air outside. So, sense, protect you, others. protect *others* wear masks. normally kill pigs gas chambers, right (we heat chambers activist organization pressured stop) slightly worse, think second existence horrible non covid days. animals suffer die unnecessarily would covid19 people purchase animal products Remdesivir mAb. prodrug gets converted ribonucleotide analog body. gets incorporated viral genome, viral RNA polymerase recognize mistake. functional level, acts virus-specific mutagen. So, sounds like there's good plan enforcement masks.

But we're supposed magically think mandate work mandate. would want control people microchips people easily controlled tracked phones? live lee county one cares. day 9 cases saw less half people wearing masks. gf works restaurant one kitchen wears mask. bar closer Friday owner said didn’t apply bar kept open. (Michigan) extended family (20 max) still want yearly cottage get together two days. 

I told dad don’t think it’s safe also want research. 

My thought we’d inside obviously lot well sleeping big concern (my extended family members think it’s hoax) that’s also something consider. 🤦🏻‍♂️

Thoughts? want see family everyone I’m thinking it’s stupid. I've read years ago article that, fact CCR5 mutation give protection bacteria infections, viral infection.
The speed transmission fit bubonic plague also.

The theory main pathogen black death probably ebola like viral hemoragic fever Yersinia pestis found mass graves black death co-infection main killer.

It's also remind humanity already survived lot worsts pathogen actual SARS-CoV-2, cost lot human lifes. Unlike FL TX New York actually likes Maryland, likely One friends trolling people Facebook saying Bill Gates developing facial recognition technology want keep privacy need wear mask. asked house...which mentioned. 

Air within mask taken added lungs. Think like dismissive.

Water fountain. Drinking stream water. measure water going drain (similar measuring mask gas levels...) going get high levels saliva...and less water comes spigot. intaking water...and likewise spit dribbling out. 

This mean water coming spigot less water say 1gal per minute rated see .5 gallon per minute go drain. There's variable there. Likewise drain water would high levels salvia... conclude water coming spigot salvia it. clearly coming you. 

If people present science without taking account factors making false conclusions.

Not sure people trying scare wearing mask job related duties. need one wearing one. People wear daily without trouble many industries... food production etc. long Covid19. dangerous. Low. Like average voter IQ KY. Johnson ""reasonable"" dont go well together. u know get Fauci face mask? *grinning wide lips split like joker* 

* me, essential worker Asthma CA know I'm trolling. can't imagine kind intervention October. Homeboy involved Fictoria. BN already knew poor judgment lmao Actually 7-day average deaths flattened. Meanwhile hospitalisations going up, that's way going. Cases  hospitalisations  deaths. takes month. sensible, lets double shaming anyone comply mask wearing worse Hitler, get side. Probably part embassy. Wait, mean 2% population dying short period time good economy? Mind = blown. wonder much it'll cost car manufacturers put breath test machines, cops give drunk drivers, cars. I.e. bac certain amount, car start. Granted there'll probably ways get around probably stop lot drunk drivers dont get, see Sooooooo many posts people saying cant wear medical reasons? asked one girl said facebook, neighbor mine street, said oh I'm sorry condition have? (Me trying nice neighbor)  said suffers claustrophobia putting cloth skin makes feel closed like cant breath.  
I didnt want dick, say, going full nudist then? gonna give hats scarfs too? scarf covers neck breath fine that.  bullshit. teacher, say that's one better solutions I've heard. Harper's East Lansing, MI outbreak too, started 15 people within days jumped 105. followed ""guidelines"" opened half capacity, real problem here. Half capacity still allows cram damn near 100 people bar. thing groceries stores department stores. 50% capacity could mean 400 people, almost never happens normal times. capacity numbers needs revamped.

Updated correction: Harpers 107. ah, yes, ones enforcement? basic problem American democracy sizable portion population thinks “freedom” means gut-feelings valid scientific knowledge.

I know it’s meant typed it, but, could think read “oh....you mean like trans woman real woman?”

It works ways. That’s hillarious idiots sides isle. OK lot problems answer sort of... meaningless.

First, that's actual answer. we're told virus beyond control contain *from federal health care entity*, interpreting mean localized outbreaks? I'm not. CDC saying Florida's Arizona's ability contain gone, right? 

So I, person role hospital plans pandemic, translates meaningful planning? 

And that's fault problem answer gave answer given you. answer answer people authority keep telling us. 

But one answer question? weird? Spwine flu suspect another human. hunch though. I'm trying understand conclusion ""they're lying"". One reason seeing ""read"" states anti-shutdown worse states protests (generally). DC VA instance. http://rt.live aren’t gargling bleach? line [NBER published national know, spreading like mad protests themselves, larger net effect appears much larger population non-protesters area staying home, resulting real increase spread areas saw mass protests.

The reopening states seems much, much bigger factor current spike. Look Louisiana--it's seeing statewide increases much better align reopening protests. fact, New Orleans (where large majority protesting done) seeing lower rates spread state whole seeing. That's thing ""shutdowns"" lot times people take themselves. People staying inside NYC went full shutdown Lol, think refine little could call thebrounsugar20 law.  think black plague alone change history way lived, paying attention school. plague massive repercussions like end feudalism. I’ve used thin bandana tried 2 layer cotton fabric one mom had. I’ve seen origami ones Etsy hesitant spend $25 something that’ll useful/useless $3 bandana. get point?  saying businesses suggest do....  make sense. 100% asymptomatic ebola-Reston strain? guess refused comprehend even talking about, bad. think predict case per day growth without knowing lot unknowns. linear exponential, know. time 25k/day 50k/day easily relatable time 50k 100k/day. least laymen mind. I'm statologist analysistician 🤪 Ah ok, reality fuck it, would give 4 weeks jail time fine. fine 10.000 dollars.  wuhan american gives chance getting chinese wuhan. not? likely no. Typically flu, especially crossed species, would hit age demographics severely. Cross species flu would potentially make COVID look like child’s play. regular /r/TalesFromYourServer, incredibly depressing watching collective despair subreddit garnered past months. Canadian find weird many Americans seem think USA performed worst Covid.

France, Sweden, Italy, Spain, UK, Belgium (which small amount Europe) worse per-capita death numbers. 

They ""more people die per million"". bit, significant chunk.

So know kind American likes distinguish ""Yahoo USA #1 Patriots"" people almost anti-American, isnt obvious way look damage Covid say ""Ok, every 100 people, many died?""

And metric, US isnt best, certainly worst western world.  president? United States? right! also: Hill said way UK secure supplies drugs pandemic, known compulsory licence, overrides intellectual property rights company. would allow UK government buy generic companies Bangladesh India, Gilead’s patent recognised.  


Am missing something? Cosnidering we’re 3-4 months far along insanely good news. 18 months considered almost impossible shortest timeline anyone could realistically aim we’re 1/3rd way we’re great place. Deaths generally lag behind outbreaks.

Also, lot younger people getting infected right now. expect stay way long.

I live Florida, saw tons people restaurants Father's day, little week ago now. We'll probably see pretty large increase 40+ patients week, large spike deaths another 2 weeks continues. Thanks! Thank you. truly hope everyone get relief Vitamin D3. keep catching it, may keep hospital. go quality data, think post percentage positive averaged x amount time, means see little spikes. Zucchini take home some. grow big fast ! planted Red Norland potatoes mid March. They’re supposed go like 90-100 days considered early season. dug around see potatoes. planted bush beans April (late frost killed them, planted May.). They’re starting produce now. Where'd get from? Well, means person spread protest, hopefully person mask on. H1N1 has. variant, G4, something new. Seasonal antibodies protect also people showing antibody test reaction it, implying infected humans. Although fundamentally variant 2009 H1N1 hard say much emerging new virus (G4) much false positive. cross-detection 2009 H1N1, that's problem measuring G4 variant. Especially since mildly effective proven reduce hospitalization time, mortality. Oh since President Orange Crony’s selling shares right now. Maybe people learn second wave. bad people need learn first hand devastating impact virus since guess media reports nearby states countries fake news. guess counterproductive Californians spared initial infections deaths.

Personally feel graduation home celebrations thrown cause too. One friend always writing basically weekly family gatherings. sad hear entire family's infected sad entirely preventable.  Poor cats got trump mouth butthole.  ah yes 10 million cases (a substantial portion ""vulnerable/elderly/weak"" claim) statistic worth sacrificed dying magically stop spreading save stock market thing one except hyper rich benefiting even die permanent life long damage immense pain suffering worth betterment economy!

I agree, let's prioritize economy lives human race, economy irreparable always babies!

And no, pneumonia deaths reported Florida hiding covid deaths, way around, feel free cite fox news article points contrary. Yeah it’s super good news. Vaccines usually take 4-6 years Fucking pathetic  low-risk groups quarantine, spreading others.

Right, low-risk groups quarantine. theyre low risk. hard. Assuming talking low-risk people test positive, where's evidence believe whatever fake news source like, I'll stick pure numbers

For someone likes numbers, sure seem ignore entirely.

[Case death ratio falling that, reopening big spike within following 2 weeks. panic for?

""Big number bad."" essentially argument boils to. Completely ignoring ICU capacity (and many ICU coronavirus symptoms), survivability, mortality rate, half dozen things show reason panic, stupid.

The simple facts are:

ICU hospital capacity **below** normal operating levels.

Most new cases asymptomatic, low risk groups

Deaths held steady weeks, despite cases

Testing capacity dramatically increasing, positive case totals stayed same

This ""second wave"", reckoning reopening soon, hell probably even result thousands people protesting rioting. media gaslighting, people like falling ignoring actual numbers matter. get comfortable. I'm AZ grandparents' neighbors duel citizens, Canadian Americans. left Canada yesterday.  Except confident vaccine literally vaccinated military average citizen releasing global public good. Hey, cat's butthole resents that. place México, stands sell pirate dvds near expanded masks types printing. possible already circulating? Look many infected covid china said anything. kidding. Kids days actually pretty much exactly like kids centuries.

Elders always think new kids lazy different. They're not. Nope. Even rise Corona, places actually seeing number hospital beds occupied. Running low PPE doctors nurses issue seems better places. fact 10-35 virus likely many major effects. bad flu week much more. society better everyone getting staying home two weeks moving on. Yup. Unpopular opinion yes know sucks especially work, like... choose kids. did. gotta can, can't kill us children. Adult lives matter too.

This pandemic. can't let kids vectors worsen all. Perhaps settled bit use proper precautions young children germy probably good idea vaccine released. Speaking which, antivaxxers need isolated allowed public schools happen. way. morons

Wow. is. virus used brainwash people rights Need expand labs, huge bottleneck lab capacity leading labs limiting many tests site submit limits tests taken site. (This according place got tested. tests available labs telling limited X submits day). species problem, handled fine many countries. right wing takeover problem, meaning mostly American problem. Presumably bunch morons, know ""aerosol transmission goes farther"". I'm expert, remember correctly specifically reconsidered guideline 2 meters 1 meter deliberation. Again, know right (pun intended), seems honest response is: scientist disagree appropriate distance Better 1/3 way dude. could 1/100 way.  Would rather flu swab nose? Stay clear Scottsdale/Paradise Valley. mask dystopia.  Lockdown worked Italy without required mask policy. daily infection rate 6,557 cases per day peak 126 per day. Sadly way going slow rise, I'm concerned leadership required. Turns always framing discussion Coronavirus terms economy instead human lives. could known that's senate majority &amp; president care about...? people problematic mostly ones scream personal freedom, too. Ultimately freedom whatever want, they're presented situation jive idea free do, freak like children. point even many big businesses wouldn't. yes. take mask eat drink, don’t go, it’s simple Masks effective people know use use common sense handling using them. curves also fake hell! LMAO

At least states like Florida confirmed hiding cases. overall US' criteria applying tests also questionable. Like, doctor who's heavy contact COVID cases eligible testing symptomatic? They're letting LOT cases slide by. blame tho? That’s good news, thought closer take kids and/or introvert. random dish tip maybe tried:

&amp;#x200B;

Blackened grilled shrimp soft tacos. Super simple fast make. made cream cheese, honey pineapple sauce blender. sauce ok taco's better suited dip shrimp. Sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes shredded cheese worked great tacos though. media needs better job scaring hell people info. many people seem think options either death, you’re 100% fine. see case numbers death numbers, go “Well, doesn’t seem bad.” media needs push stories people aren’t elderly coming away lung damage, liver damage, kidney damage, etc. Like don’t even know everything virus might yet. That’s terrifying, people horrified wearing goddamn masks that’s fucking takes. Next rushing line refrigerated trucks. pleasure, glad hear it! lockdown shutdown, partial business closure combined mask recommendation ""safer home"" recommendation order either those.

There local mask orders, statewide. comparison May pretty nice month __WOO MINUTE MAID RULES__ There's mask mandate? 

With kind spread I'm sure much masks help people still dining gathering. They're normally 76%, fear mongers Yes Except people said protests, everyone told matter virus spread easily outdoors matter. would matter people barbecues cookouts stuff outside families? it? significant risk infection outdoor activities like barbecuing family protesting, there? something completely unexpected. money Rabid Aids Bears.  throw poor kids big dumpster? mean, they're here.  20 percent population already infected more.  Less people spread 2-3 people 10 already .  Don’t give New York test numbers people mild symptoms going getting tested spiking cases. Downvoted stating facts spell doomsday Reddit's official Commy-approved coronavirus prop-o-ganda sub lol pretty insane nothing really surprises anymore way handled. even phase one yet, could driven across bridge Vancouver, Washington half-hour 2 phases ""ahead"" us. Illinois Wisconsin issue heard. *Yee Haws Texas* Yeah, countries overwhelmed didn’t time hit them. China time busy denying it. really hope US gets fast. One best friends nurse PA. actually think flu gonna kind mitigated hygiene mask wearing. could still bad never try mitigate like 40% people even vaccinate normal year. Hopefully year get high vax rates lower transmission masks hand washing, fewer parties. honestly needs happen, gym bar/restaurant trying sue government forced closures. gonna foot bill patrons end hospital? touche! one perspective everything going on. Basically perspective need balance keeping cases control also allowing economy survive social fabric die closures affecting poor minorities most, taking away jobs, preventing children underprivileged homes getting education good social environment putting burden parents, especially single mothers. would fun try!! I've seen lots good recipes Instagram.. garden community IG really great, wanna, makeup models... outrage everyone. care, take issue fact triage method medical pros trained right call make resources run out. still outrage happening anywhere within US. find interesting think pharma imperialist countries similar histories.

Quite ahistorical optimist. vaccine produced not-for-profit duration coronavirus pandemic. Jenner Institute supported Jenner Vaccine Foundation, UK registered charity. 

Furthermore, among knowledgable experts vaccines world. equals, no-one better. 

The vaccine developing platform vaccine started five years ago specifically ‘Coronavirus X’, hypothetical (at time) pandemic causing coronavirus. safety shown, efficacy yet known. similar approach flu vaccine tweaked every year. pass tests vaccine currently market. Thanks showing side issue logical way. need people like society  wait disaster yet? think making Lord Rings reference. random; people get physically closer together bars restaurants, get drunk messy, dance exert themselves, lot shouting heard, tend stay longer. People desensitized. 

You see right now. Anytime someone posts case count going up, first response ""what death rate?"". People want worry covid anymore. summer, election year, want feel good, money pocket keep going lives. 

As Mike Tyson says...everyone plan punched face. Looking again, clue Et tu Austin, et tu? Thanks! idea. Yeah like commented elsewhere school district kinda pulled together last three months. wasn’t easy us prepared fall. Thanks input! good questions worth discussing. IMO culture values old lives way much doesn’t value lives young people enough. humans supposed live almost century able keep mental faculty? It’s crazy stuff think about. wanting COVID vaccine right away mean anti-vaccine general. would refuse even try get first could go vulnerable people first. Maybe start June 7 day moving average around 20,000 25,000 cases day. 40,000 day. could easily reach 100,000 levels end July things improve least NY leadership willing mandate full mask use enforce social distancing. never get continue allow people kill people refuse cover holes. Would able listen music, podcasts, audiobooks throughout day? Well, don’t naive browse reddit. I’ve forced vegan quarantined vegan sister allow animal products house really bad health problems it. bruising body reason, hair falling out, I’ve lost weight eyes sunken in. feel weak I’m hungry time matter much eat. I’ve months don’t say it’s body adjusting. Humans need nutrients animal products. Vegans malnourished. don’t eat unethically farmed meats bats shit need nutrients animals. experience made feel like vegans awful. force dietary beliefs someone else watch become sicker weaker pretty messed up. put perspective BBC News update current outbreak Victoria Australia 40 new cases per day rising panic mode next story US 40000 new cases per day no-one seemed think concern.. Meanwhile, Trump gets tested daily everyone around frequently tested. That's part public see real #'s Florida still manipulating data? Conflict interest dispute all. I'd even go far say right winged people would ones wearing masks would lefties needed persuading Trump muddied water.

Can imagine easily Fox News could scared viewers wearing masks? They'd voluntarily line supermarket entrances guns enforce mask wearing.

At root anti-vaxers beliefs fear idea they're what's best interests health. would first people wearing masks again, muddied made debate.

Now Pence co. going take high road claim supported masks along remember Pence's hospital visits without mask. people listen now? No. remember the_donald sub still around, they'd say Pence bending knee please liberal media.

If Trump caves issue, they'll say pleasing media like back peddles racist tweets, occasionally.  perfect society every adult make rational assessments would agree dont live society. instance especially, doesnt take lot resources energy government officials strongly urge people put mask on. swine flu virus never shown spread human human. would require massive evolution that, would hard us vaccinate compared coronavirus. Reminder FL fired person collecting presenting data refused manipulate data support reopening narrative. numbers probably already really distorted minimize blowback governor state government. Fuck Goldman Sachs Unfortunately, [that's Phase 3 test sample general population. healthy, not. testing take least one year depending many years spent Phase 2.

We're testing vaccines phases^ year. shortening length safety observation mere months.

After Phase 3, deemed safe everyone unless defined safety restriction (e.g. children, pregnancy, etc).

My understanding special period, like described, beyond happening now.

And I'm concerned. mandate it, make difference ""don't tread crowd."" continue ignore spread it. promise Utah #s much worse. Test utah really dropped ball fucked lot things up. They'd point say ""See! One cough fine, dont NEEDEM!"" validates need go work, get hair done, hit gym, party - without mask social distancing - demonstrates maturity 5 year old. Beyond that, it’s false premise since dip shits weren’t following protocols beforehand, either. They’re looking excuse brandish selfish behavior.

I see ends spectrum neither group following science. risk mitigation policies need based facts reality. reality people catch COVID one thing make activity high risk! catch COVID anywhere likelihood happening almost guaranteed places practically negligible others. people desperately want COVID sort plague justifies whatever hardline nonexistent measures personally want take instead looking actual facts. one hesitates chastise people making plenty bad financial decisions, even relied believed reliable information. endless attack liberal arts majors comes mind.

Starting small business different me; risky endeavor. Start one, there's 2/3 chance done 10 years. idea time money well spent, unless six figures lying around. numbers, I'd say something wrong. 

I know expect criticism (other small business worship among Americans, course). Yup. India similar problem. government tried impose Chinese-style lockdown, Indian people comply, never even flattened curve, slowed months. really starting take off, India looking mass hospitalization. know, (R)epublicans would listened tried shutdown economy first time, need multiple shutdowns make things worse, no, wanted eat restaurants get haircuts. see. Thanks input. school/district couldn’t make zoom mandatory lot teachers went ahead held zoom classes, school created master schedule shared parents. middle school worked 3 teachers zoom lessons (out 20). expect happen there's ""flu"" like virus attacks heart, lungs, brain circulatory system...

Even avid drug users suffering heart attacks alarming rate. drug supplies running low due border closures drugs dirtier ""cut"" ever (although, yes, small part it)


(I live Vancouver BC, suffering overdose-crisis well pandemic, time) think point err side caution. though. evidence ""for life"". far know, still low probability person hospitalized, that, certain percentage might get lifelong damage. people dying scared yet, doubt lung damage will. mean, lung damage stopped lot people know smoking... measured time steps? title wtf nypost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

April 16th positivity rate 20% according ""The Atlantic"". way tests, allowing everyone test, half percent lower, thats good news.

Ignore idiot high math wrong thing rich people I'm sympathetic point making here, fair death lag time like 2-4 weeks (accounting long takes die COVID reported) rather 7 days? Collectively? No, couple twats decided everyone else. New Zealand let New Yorkers visit That's Ron Paul.

Or Rand Paul also doctor?! ""Nothing fear fear itself"" long slow exceptionally painful death due faulty vaccine. I'm still in. no, deaths lag 4-5 weeks. 

Just reporting official reporting death taks 2 weeks. 

so please change reminder 4 weeks (singe big surge cases started last week). absence COVID-19 symptoms persons infected SARS-CoV-2 might necessarily imply absence harm. research needed determine significance subclinical lung changes visible computed tomography scans. I’d rather bet less deaths more... get ceiling fan put garage could turn propel lingering droplets floor. perhaps drywall fan blow back door?

I think CDC says droplets settles surfaces pretty quickly own.

Also heat UV deactivate virus. slow cooker, google ""A Year Slow Cooking."" recipes anything think of, put cooker forget hours. tried one lasagna recipes great! reason many making vaccines? put eggs one basket but, happens per se Oxford vaccine passes trials first? teams give go home? I’ve 4 United flights past 3 weeks. 6 seats open. don’t GAF anything $$$ think behavioral traits anything nature.
Yes - understand flattening curve works.. whats point everybody dying depression, drugs, violence, crime? People obsessed covid death rates lockdown killing people ways.

I mean Sweden lax 6 thousand deaths 60k cases.
The death rate never going bad. bad small amount people. long school reopened better mask miserable wear sun. Well said US administration top-notch pandemic response plan ready go years. Trump administration rejected ignored plan. resources said, ""Nope, interested."" i'm wrong, tell me, well could be, see reason would need reach herd-immunity.

It's simple. 

Viruses short lives high reproduction rates. Evolution exists. Every new generation virus potential mutate something else renders vaccines useless, finds new ways spread, new deadly complications. 1918 pandemic featured second strain deadlier first. 

Herd immunity prevents mutating jumps across hosts.  dont ban china world, god's sake. Unless increase testing 4 fold, doubt happen. client mine nursing instructor (?) said people flocking profession. said felt driven something, help. calling. 

Better people me. would’ve quit already. test n=40 get 94% phase one? n=40/n1=2.5%  Soooo.  ALSO, reported events grade 1 severity. percent numbers showed grade 1 effects they? poops? Nose bleed? Let's forget ""GRADE 1 (Mild) Transient (goes away short time) mild discomfort; limitation activity; medical intervention/therapy required."" Also, good news, also meaningless without context. Piling (ha ha) bidet recommendation. wound finally buying one awesome. female especially appreciate it. 😂 thing is, we've roll toilet paper 6 weeks still almost full. pretty much use blow nose I'm toilet lol.

No, seriously, get bidet, cold water ones cheap sound like would uncomfortable water cold, get used pretty fast.  brainwashed using police scapegoat systematic problem society holds people races... sheep playing right hands corporations care money. feel sorry you. agreement started production India vaccine delayed. vaccines like Moderna’s Sinovac’s also mass produced, benefit Imperial’s vaccine it’s really easy mass produce. Oxford’s vaccine grants temporary immunity could provide valuable time What's likely happening lower income classes spend proportionally much income necessities. might effecting economy literally option spend.


If make 32,000 per year, likely spend 30,000 per year basic necessities(Food, housing, clothing). literally can't reduce spending save money rainy days, vast majority income spent surviving. 




Where upper classes spend proportionally less necessities. may make 3 times much(96,000 per year), food cost 3 times much. buy food costco get great deal, like lower income earners.



Those high income people would normally spending large amount 96,000 regular purchases. Shopping, food nice restaurants, fancy clothes, nice cars. things first thrown window pandemic hits. 



Now, many spending less money can't/aren't going anymore. Cooking meals home, need fancy new dress there's parties go too, etc, etc. global manipulation data governments terrifying short sighted. Take UK government post comes fairly hidden page governments website explains testing:

Testing broken 4 ""Pillars"":

Breakdown testing testing strategy ‘pillars’
Pillar 1: swab testing Public Health England (PHE) labs NHS hospitals clinical need, health care workers
Pillar 2: swab testing wider population, set government guidance
Pillar 3: serology testing show people antibodies COVID-19
Pillar 4: serology swab testing national surveillance supported PHE, ONS, Biobank, universities partners learn prevalence spread virus testing research purposes, example accuracy ease use home testing

So simplify, Pillar 1 hospital COVID tests, Pillar 2 home COVID tests Pillars 3 4 antibody tests.

The governments daily testing figures made 4 pillars even though first 2 related actual active COVID tests rather antibody tests.

Todays testing figures: 133,467
Todays tests excluding Pillars 3 4: 102,509

Now lets look Pillar 2 closer. pillar consists 2 types community tests; tests done professionals drive centres tests sent peoples houses do.

Bare mind invasivenes tests think second reliably people able home get reliable result. lets look breakdown Pillar 2:

Drive in: 11,245
At home: 52,095

Roughly 5 6 Pillar 2 tests home tests done untrained members public. fact, means 52,095 102,509 COVID tests done public themselves.

The testing statistics country joke, aritificially inflated meet arbitrary target, process actively stopping effective tracking epidemic here.

And isnt last shocking find made. scroll page section titled ""Time Series"" download csv file names ""Time Series Testing Statistics"" see full breakdown data.

If look Column E, titled ""Daily Number Tests"". scroll right bottom CSV todays data, namely row 814, see UK figures Pillar 1. column E see todays reported Pillar 1 number: 39,169.

But heres good bit. look column G see titled ""Daily Number People Tested"" figure 21,939.

By governments admission, testing patient twice reporting tests statistics.

So break UK government claimed done 133,467 tests, remove anitbody tests double tests left 85,279 tests 52,095 (61%) done untrained members public.

Shambles Fauci dickhead profits pandemics. Check patents holds. remember model presented March deaths zeroing June. point surprised all. beginning June averaging 20,000 cases day roughly 40,000 day. could easily see thus reaching atleast close 100,000 day end July. Real worry us hell hospitals going cope Saying ""reopening "" let's testing subjects 2 weeks, people get sick dont, city decide new rules give af stay open (highly likely) shove throat whether like not. Done.  problem Indiana positive rate around 9.5 percent. indicates enough testing done catch infected. generally thought need enough testing drive percent positives 5 percent. Alaska, example, positive rate 1 percent. really, everyone protesting new normal instead running businesses working jobs. get now. Every government everything power avoid intermittent lockdowns even probably enforcing them. Although efficiency intermittent lockdowns debatable overall may even put much dent overall CFR. 

The foundations entire nations globalized economies depend social/physical interactions economies function. completely remote world possible. risk virus isn’t worth wiring humans function. physical social interaction (indoor dining, bars, dancehalls, concerts, clubs, sporting events, weddings, banquets, conferences, etc)? Like another commenter said, never better prepared weather storm. Imagine would things. proud happy you. Keep up! Maybe x rays scarred life lungs change minds. already people literally drawing equivalence mask mandate holocaust. 

""What need government coming *our* homes, telling us *our* bodies. start that, slippery slope, they're gonna inviting us go cattle cars take ride rails.""

A woman said Milton City Council meeting rescinded mayor's executive order mandate face masks stores. I’m sorry happening you. Thank working keep people safe. crazy time easy us take sides forget real people trying best survive nightmare. hope manage keep business, congratulations new baby good luck family. H1N1, swine flu, one kind virus though. recent swine flu weak H1N1 virus really bad 1918 Spanish flu also H1N1, hence concern. Generally speaking H1N1 viruses rarely fatal highly contagious, whereas H5N1 bird flu viruses tend lethal harder spread. saying is...

*Two weeks....*

RemindMe! Two weeks Sounds like leadership. See edit initial comment. God ate words quickly

Edit: I’m idiot. forgot pharmacy pick spoilsport, read BBC article today (posted hour ago) G4 EA H1N1 appears brand new swine flu ""with pandemic potential"" appearing China. Related H1N1... different current vaccines unlikely effective.

The Chinese scientists identified new virus pigs, evidence transmission workers farms abattoirs. 

All need emergent flu coming year Covid-19 addressed! Churches excluded executive order. stay open filled brim. Oh agree, seen many people aren’t? drink home, isn’t hard. save tonnes money  Omg!!! state legit thinks we're invisible. We've 78 deaths far state, North Dakota. total number positive cases we're 3200 more. around 260 currently active. town live in, 10 construction workers tested positive. shit insane!! give examples made insurance great? curious. Tube throat diaper play? churches exempt restrictions? Americans dumb things given choice.

Japan never locked fully, cause constitution prohibits order. Masks never mandated.

People it. Everywhere. Without questioning, cause makes sense give shit home.

Here's video Harajuku Station that, remember *masks actually required law there.*

America deeply sick culture. say ""everyone"" like shit inevitable. inevitable.

We choose shitty. Facebook pretty terrible.  one cloth mask wear entire shift

How long masks good for? wear one work receptionist, 8 hours long? 100 million citizens untethered reality

Nowhere near many. media distorts view ourselves.

Trump 62 million votes 2016 election.  Nowadays he'd get far fewer. Long walks best new hobby since started. Aside really whatever comfortable with. end going dine restaurant patio stressing whole time, i'd say really worth it. 

Otherwise, use common sense; go store unless need to, try grocery pickup avoid contact people, wash sanitize hands regularly wear mask around strangers!  Ah, caught Vine Flu then? We’ve beaten before. gotten test? Yeah, essential here. cases may growing, deaths bad before, yay that! Or, follow proper sanitation distancing eat indoors essentially zero risk.

There’s enough places rise cases conclude done safely minimal risk.

People need stop clumping things “essential” “non-essential” evaluate things case case basis. There’s plenty “essential” things high risk, also lots “non-essential” things low/zero risk. forgot part whole point gym intentionally work big sweat possible sharing stuff. He’ll running sen ate 2022 McSally likely going lose. think Americans may picked wrong message Rage you, tell Yes lot opened packed. Big Surf Tempe right thing opted stay closed whole season props them. Yeah, they’re exactly inexpensive. theory Americans might done China first.

But China first, America spent first 2 month defaulting claiming everything China wrong, got trapped ideological opposite right thing, America is, essentially, collectively wrong thing China.

For reason China ideologically locked right thing well, opposite US doing.

This reality politics based purely us vs them. Well four zeroes number, zero basically nothing, therefore 12 people died nobody died. Crisis averted, well done team! sacrifice saved everyone else, forgotten.  yeah wasnt talking lung tissue per se, people actually increase slightly lung capacity healthy tissuewith exercises. course get lung scarring almost one back 100%. sometimes sucks alive guess knows. contact tracing abysmal failure US. Surprise, surprise. Vikingese: T-Cells. exactly wonder plexiglass strategy causing pockets ""dead air"" vital particles becoming trapped. go floor ceiling, work, do, create host new problems. lot people positions power comfortable, cozy, they'd kissed enough ass get wanted ...  


they sign lead handle REAL problems, signed play political games collect paychecks retire somewhere full pockets "" normal "" person afford.  music, bizarre rants. You’re glad live NYC? one area legitimate, 1,000 people died today, outbreak? Interesting... Yes, even conservative estimate, say virus started apreading December 1st Wuhan. 8 weeks later would hundreds thousands infected people living normally R=2-4

It likely happened NYC, 30k deaths CCP reported 1/10 deaths daily say. I'm sure matters much. current correlation increase case US mortality rate ? Everyone look it’s left hysterical small number deaths. 

I demand freedoms drink bros bar they're right want make it, need there's federal assistance meaningful way. ""Investigation"" aka guided tour Even so, really can't sit EAT mask Lead example, fukin kidding me? moron? Gyms like literally last place besides bars open. sucks miss gym like crazy I'm making outside... summer... go run. help stop spread something that's actively killing others? Hell yes worth risk life. getting vaccine selfish. person obviously please.

Note: understand wanting wait see side effects negate benefit vaccine. also people react badly vaccines general, can't medical reasons. case may reasonable wait. However, one takes vaccine know works, side effects? I'm fine taking one team, especially case. Right ya buddy. Landlord one house paid i'm renting living mortgaged home. People spouting like guy never actually owned house adopting ""I've got mine.. maybe smarter"" mentality like criticize 1% for. hypocrisy really astounding.  


It really choosing beggar mentality. ""If like giving free housing.. maybe business want free housing from"". end landlord getting pissed selling bank walking away.. guess what? bank kick ass asap. Arizona isn’t locking down. Phoenix restricted restaurants/bars casinos. What's insane: ICUs filled covid patients otherwise survivable car accident death sentence. Great. smart think 150 30,000+ lot. Time another limited lockdown. can't enforce mask mandate, that's way. course believe that. man stupid enough openly bragged shaking hands covid patients know bar. know many people flooded bar. Majority entitled FOMO since can’t miss social media story. Pathetic. $15 app, $30 entree, $10 desert, 2 drinks @$15 = $85 + $8 tax + $17 tip = $110 Sadly, think spot points mean blame lady, problem went got service without ever asking price. really fault - hospitals advertising price. Would go buy car sign paperwork blindly? Would take car body work without shopping around quotes? Hire contractor house project without reading contract first talking different ones? course not, works way health insurance?

&amp;#x200B;

The problem insurance used everything. works auto insurance pet insurance (most common plans) travel insurance, home insurance. get flat tire dead battery need oil change, pay pocket. toilet broken carpet gets soiled, home insurance dealing it. Travel insurance buying hotels airfare (and imagine would happen hotels airfare did).

 Insurance catastrophic. there's transparency consumer. middle man ""negotiates"" prices blindly assume take care things. That's prices go up, hospital get away charging $6k.

&amp;#x200B;

I get bloodwork done private labs now. pay pocket. costs half paying before, annual physical, even BlueShield PPO non-high deductible plan - pocket cost (the actual total cost billed Sutter Health Medical even higher).

Kaiser, HMO provider every visit $20 copay, need physically see doctor. E-visits free. I've also used tele-medicine services paid cash, insurance, also cheaper dealing PPO/insurance. Deaths keep dropping staying flat. 10 days ago told wait 2 weeks death avalanche. Maybe 4 days. sub can't accept something else play virus.

Why feeling need hostile? absolutely everything believe mind do? distancing, masking unnecessary time may million reasons someone mask. matter it. fine. wonder massive protests across country lasted weeks involved people mobbing piling cars drive around states anything it?

Quite literally propping stock market backs taxpayers.

A youtuber named Ted Bauman made good video watched weeks ago, remember exactly one though. really expect people wear masks GyM?? GYM's open? Maybe one day cure Coronavirus, pray never cure stupid! clearly stated protesters risking spreading virus. point was, reason gather important, worth taking risk.

Edit: look profile. 

1. hellbent going protests. Mulitlpe posts looting, several spread virus. like black people, admit it. might feel better afterwards.

2. multiple occasions stated ""economy lockdown"" rationale quite verbal Corona bad look numbers. Please refrain calling anybody anti-science future, since obviously interested basing opinions science way, shape form. people could getting better home hospital incentived put beds ventilators. Shoots right outta air apparently coming info later. I'll try stay updated. I'll take not! Flattened IQ Curve! 

We're #1 Stupidity. weird dont people parents aunts uncles grandparents people know chronic illnesses? Erring side caution like, rather cautious end wrong. blame bars.

I said also, importantly, blame power keep safe make vulnerable lie it. get away it. help one large group people, hurt one large group people. solution. Yeah, mean, fair, that's kind line policy violence. I've happen me, literally quoting Lord Crouton word word Thank Dr. Gates.

What even here? matter say, I'm gonna change anyone here's mind... plan always hard lock down. Hard. Everything closed - schools, businesses, restaurants, bars, grocery stores - EVERYTHING. Give everyone days prepare, leave house 6 weeks. leave house need go hospital - nothing else.

Then, come August 15th, done nonsense. over. NY DC. want examples? Huge protests, COVID.. Droplets actually get cotton covering, thing much slow cotton, even droplets leave cotton dont go fraction far. 

Protection face coverings almost entirely medical grade ppe, studies saw normal cloth masks people make something like 15% less likely get sick much considered significant amount protection. 

I'd worried lack masks serious danger well. least someone on. South Carolina it’s rare see them. Lol no. retired philanthropy thing. Ill gotten.. eh.... maybe, somewhat yeah (I'm Linux guy). let's honest get rich unless play system.

But he's done wealth Waltons, Rothschilds, Jobs combined.

Yikes get large Farva Obviously virus spread college open fall. know thought suggesting won't. saying 150 cases come surprise school large. can't support someone actively attempting remove people's 2nd amendment rights what's worse completely ignorant function operations firearms yet throws bs misinformation firearms much push agenda see cases ticking PA? know counties southwestern PA bigger increases, southeast still well. 

NJ PA seem around number new cases day. PA went bit 5% positive we’ve like two weeks. We’re really starting hit record highs testing though finally. Basically yea that’s reduce risk disease reaching people allergic vaccine think that's part problem. Nothing changing. What's disturbing symptoms worse now. You, like. Keep good fight Americans acting like spoiled, entitled little fuckers 11. saving much money figured eat things like Lobster every week price mediocre restaurant meal. people follow what's happening elsewhere US? care. yes United sayint a-todaso... but... churches. still position massive increase cases Texas Florida due primarily increased testing?

I’m speechless cares people testing positive.

its either catch virus nothing happens, die.

there outcomes. missing several weeks work one, maybe suffering permanent long term damage, plus energy 1-2 weeks.

Every single industry tossing lawsuits Dr Acton Governor Dewine. would cheaper. could've written post, college major. Feels lot less lonely seeing others write words. what’s point? You’re critical protestors. critical casual party people without masks? Yes, double standard reason protested. doesn’t make okay. protests weren’t safe either.

You also double standard. First positive test May 18th much gap. suspect another case fully getting rid first infection flares again. Patreon built influencers exposing Shoulda waited...  Agreed, fair, common tattoos. also dislike. Where’s mayor need her??? think lot vaccines rely herd immunity extent. study two months back evaluated depending heterogeneity population different transmission factors - say one group active interacting people, less, etc - % herd immunity might drop significantly transmissive groups society get immune (and since higher exposure, likely get virus first).   Since Americans start comparing bottom list rather top? ""at least Mississippi-ing"" coronavirus. 

It's failure squandered work paid dearly March, April, May. responses thread appreciate much ones Twitter house   one 120K dead, would probably different outlook. many self-loathing Americans subreddit. everything you, insufferable. Awesome! brought kid exposed lots kids hospital without mask, child ill, still make lot excuses people responsible. virus, care struggle.

The exceptions truly can't. describe circumstances. 130,000 people died. many people live town? yeah, well could seen mass political protests coming? like one brianc150 lol.

It's 800 years old whopper, wouldn't. 


Can hear coming even speak enough ruin day. right counts, really responding comment. comment regarding soft power have. right maybe calculate whether worth we're spending. 

However Trump allies actually saving us money. Trump increased military budget rather cut it. one thing contemplate worth that, spend amount (or more) fail make diplomatic overtures turn expenditures soft power they're meant insane. 

It's important pick horse here. Either spend money get value spend something else get value that. Problem Trump he's stupid understand calculus. Germany forced air (whether AC heat) really rare. Usually AC radiant heat, coincidentally good combating coronavirus I'm told Sweden well. I'm ""rich"" means I've worked hard able good life made good choices.

Just orange daddy right completely failed face global pandemic mean top soon. NJ, first off, yes everybody jumped bars soon opened chaos, however, nothing nearly off-putting many times Governor Murphy uses word “knucklehead” 😂 lmao I’m glad. I’m sorry people know that’s earn living. got given inch everyone took god damn mile. see social media people bitching ruining 4th July plans blah blah blah Face coverings dramatically reduce droplet transmission, may ineffective airborne particles cases, people still overlook facts droplet transmission dismiss shit know nothing about. IKR it’s spelled stupid, I'm dad I'm pretty sure seen exact opposite first thought ""how news, fucking wish swing set"" realized am, fact, moron. also work fine dining. We're packed solid everyday guests act like nothing's going on. politely remind people wear masks moving about, working skeleton crew that's overworked capacity police everyone, mention wanting screw tips depend living. 

Also EVERYBODY meeting people live with. America's constitution far away oldest constitution. last 19 years good reason. fact, Georgia cases increased rather significantly

From worldometers:

cases then: 43400
cases now: 79417

an increase 82% five weeks.

Almost half last increase last week. like person says someone says ""it's going rain like hell today"" wrong &amp; ridiculous historic flood rain really get going 2 minutes midnight.

We used word people like that, frowned upon use days. hope too! entire family back home they're scientifically literate...they need strong leaders keep em safe end care people right thing, long it. agree enthusiastically. Yup. It’s going mess thankful I’m one deciding! better chance shamed belittled WEARING mask right I'm from. wife someone fake cough direction store day. friend mine told doctor told mask really help ant ""hated wearing it"". doctor loop telling people that.

Much ridiculous misinformation spread via Facebook social media seen. combined lapses leadership like one. defense production act could employed, ""teeth"" never tested. instance, company ordered produce something free might accept contract, reduce employees salary minimum wage try go business employees quit response - probably lot done stop that. Using DPA enforce price controls good idea force employees work - companies accept contracts. also never tested court company accepts contract, fails produce supply goods. Jamming something like courts cost bad idea.

A better move would Congress simply mandate suggested. Remember people worried Trump going fire Fauci back March / April Fauci making Trump look bad?

Something even worse happened. large portion Americans stopped paying attention Fauci now. Trump even fire - many Americans ignoring Fauci now. NZ completely re-opened weeks ago. absolutely domestic restrictions health advice apart stay home get tested develop symptoms. Ouch, that's discouraging.  agree that; piece know much development covered taxpayers (actual numbers, self-reported numbers inflate things like ""lost potential revenue"" something). totally get cost manufacture $10, development adds $500, taxpayers funded half resulting 25x markup $250 something. hard time swallowing exact drug sold tiny fraction cost countries, massive markup specifically American taxpayers funded research simultaneously Gilead rakes ~$5 Billion year net income y/y. Positive stereotypes still racist something.  Comparing life insurance fair comparison. Life insurance measure someone's worth, measure much want pay premiums give certain amount money survivors off-chance suddenly die. calculate premiums based health/age odds occurs. Cancel shit don’t place food mouth, masticate, swallow, speak without mask you’re shopping. Indoor dining needs wait till 2021. scandalous

 Pretty sure saw thing schedule today lunch Pence. means he's golfing. .....as see, absolutely betting man Spin proverbial grave. number people believing things heading downhill fast growing daily. high schooler got H1N1 ended losing 20 pounds, went 165-145. awful. fact downvote upvotes tells still major problem general public. Severe cases deaths go territory. Hopefully new breakthroughs treatment reduce mortality rate, ICU's reach capacity also get deaths. Plus seeing many long-term negative health affects related COVID, really serious disease. can’t serious. callous thing say 125,000 people. You’re willing act like it’s big deal?

Oh nevermind you’re troll account. can’t waste time. Sorry. I’ve seen restaurants ones decent job. Well lot anyways. Bars clubs rivers fucking us There's reason black community disproportionately impacted Covid. Karishma highly offended didn’t make Applebee’s joke. majority still weren’t concerned, they’ve things taken away. fully expect toddler-like meltdown general public.  swear God, Gen Z (at least US) going traumatized generation. born immediate aftermath 9/11, grew recession, gained voting abilities Time see Donald Trump get elected, exiting college right pandemic comes results mass unemployment.

I wish snarky comment end levity, just.... Jesus christ Make sure go unarmed too. really makes feel certain way. Haha really? at? We've pretty regular since late May. It’s far better get type triage system place objective reproducible make us physicians decide things fly. moral damage enduring sustainable given requirements provide counseling therapy event going lose doctors nurses. 

We trained provide triage disaster. kind sustained daily, weekly, monthly pain something trained endure. Getting heat shock proteins  Yeah, initially looked like LA far easier time NYC figured due sprawl. They've undone benefit. Exactly, get blackout drunk home like rest us normal folks. link relevant article stating that? China actually tried peddle misinformation regarding virus's origin central news agencies actually regaled death covid causing around world.

This article going geopolitics virus -but pointing one simple fact - CCP intentionally lied corrupted data provided - implications (considering pandemic started) debate.

Like mentioned earlier comments, respect botched pandemic response governments around world. But, left academics like me, taking step room till everything's control. inherently unsafe exercising near bunch people without masks on. even wearing mask you’re really bad spot. would bother telling trump wear mask he's president... |)oomer new meaning lol Yes, hate  miss gym took month closed deal change goals. Whereas pre-Covid working powerlifting becoming denser, I've switched bodyweight goals becoming leaner, running more, etc Soros going pay hell lot already die COVID-19 make Trump look bad. Let send reminder bank routing numbers. encourage ignorance/lies gets updated face overwhelming death political defeat.

We applaud bank robber finally giving loses hostages, instance. Man gotta get SoCal. many border jumper idiots area Jesus Blood bathers i’m waiting property sell run tf outta get woods bit. 

2 weeks, right taxes due. GL one America. GL Aug 1st. California huge population great testing infrastructure put jaw dropping numbers coming weeks.  welcome.  It’s almost 2 weeks without dramatic increase cases (10%), that’s also including bunch things opening, protests, etc.

So again, clearly weird vendetta restaurants can’t comprehend done safely. maybe wrong start, may never know.

Pandemics 2nd 3rd waves people (or case entire country) idiots don’t follow simple hygiene rules. Hell, need presidential mandate. Owners increase prices menu items small percentage pass minor increase BOH.  chaos Wuhan first three/four weeks. doubt even know real numbers beginning. Wait.... Americans pay test? developed world find rediculous. people tested Sundays likely hospital patients, someone going provider’s office.  Damn, literally cannot imagine Facebook disabling news feed 2020. super not-great going traditional school places fall 9,000 reasons. problem going given choice. time figure handle problems now, teachers start dying entire country schooling home faster blink. Teachers Unions protect interest kids.   implies CCP act protect themselves, Beijing, etc.

The official story around 800 cases 24 deaths sufficient quarantine hub at. Even then, still see spread bit, hub.

Your suggestion CCP took every city China, 100,000+ infected, presumably 3,000 dead even began taking measures. Seems stretch me. shouldn’t scared good news regardless past. don’t hope all? mention, lunching? leader suggesting less testing anyone wears mask spite HIM. country fucked... *with lifetime excellent heathcare benefits.  takes lot bravery mental fortitude consider accept worst scenario might possibly coming. mental preparation rock things get that. Respect best luck coworkers. jealous live somewhere get pho. Best hangover food ever! [AKA Wind Wait...NJ opened bars restaurants? guy stinks like hot ducey would venture say small medium sized *indoor* space avoided people without face coverings. feel bad owners bars indoor restaurants. type businesses going stay closed truly control situation. imagine home AC isnt problem though. Public buildings PNW still largely air conditioned U.S. 3rd world country wearing Gucci belt. think another lockdown coming? states mask requirement point time. Nope. 

A quick google showed last year's first day August 3. China, it’s tradition PLA soldiers go front line major disasters, earthquakes,floods etc. 
unlike MSM reports, Chinese residents feel safer PLA soldiers dispatched local area.
USA really lagging behind crucial information. Obama besides give good speeches? Seriously. failure address pressing socioeconomic systemic problems led people disillusioned led directly Trump. I'd say reasonable re-opening good adherence masking would worst see ""bump"" rather spike, hope public health officials really robust test trace program set (grasping hope here...) effectively stop outbreaks getting control.

Spikes, like seen Texas, opening way soon, throwing caution wind terms masking, regulations establishments, etc. Much EU opened mid-May, Canada re-opened 4 weeks, far seen bump yet, let alone spike, waiting bated breath, expect bump soon here.

But looks anything like Texas month two, I'll say we've completely failed well. think outcome anyone willing accept. leans left, extremely so. mainly it’s doom gloom. It’s going take Trump Pence catching winding hospital get enough people take seriously slow spread. America, sadly, yes, unreasonable. Yeah... gotten yet. totally agree. time relax, honesty, think Canadians ""get it"", pretty much.........

Reminds kid........""Why wear mask, Billy""? ""Well, Americans wear masks, mom........."" ""Sure, American told jump bridge, would it???"".............""Well, without mask, mom. Relax""

lolol Middle pandemic soaring unemployment. Compare image times history crazy different lifestyle is. Stimulus works though. Better this, hungry people streets. camera mounts (I think cameras regardless) still used vr systems provide slightly better tracking anymore way prefer way.

The reverb g2 coming fall way better resolution still wired. school going in-person classes like person replying to, suggest you, too, follow recommendations made. Let’s chat anti-Vaxxers year...

You think they'll still here? hand.... New flu strain, probably little immunity, evidence animal-human transmission, could BFD year. sanguine get Covid-19 control worldwide address new flu effectively. Since onset virus seen many people wearing masks worse yet sneering negatively commenting people wearing them. go would wally world person tasked check number people entering would paying attention goofing off. mixed results employees wearing masks even less customers wearing masks. Elderly children wearing masks, mixed age family one two wearing mask. wearing mask half wearing properly less half proper mask (a bandana proper protection). doubt lot people take seriously still, imagine lot people still refusing wear mask. Yes Kansan, yes wear proper mask proper way go store, keep strict limit. see difference fighting systemic racism getting drunk?

Of course don't.... Experiment captive audience. thoughtful. OC beaches busy weekend. many morons FB feed saying refuse lockdown, refuse wear mask, done this.

One girl posted picture girl 2020 wearing face mask, 2021 mask larger, 2022 hijab covered hair face showing eyes caption ""FUCK NO!""

I delete get pleasure finally see come realization real. girl refuses wear mask posted ""My buddy Covid-19 best friend dies week it, real people!!!!"" next day posts refusal wear mask ""they work"". Same, specifically liked gym grungy frills. There's way I'm heading back till things actually blown over. disagree, can't discount amount people pre-gaming thanks affordability/access Uber.

Unless Uber shut NJ. Ya know, choosing arbitrary date worthless. People still travel countries continents. would work everyone time. several waves vaccine. Yep Oh, wasn’t massive amount people elbow elbow protests? people believe whatever media says. 100% agree cant fathom line cooks get fucked hard. 


So president. 3 policies would implement cooks get bigger fairer share money? Imho bro society needs reformed.

There reason someone like restaurant workers provide typically amazing service lazy fucks want make good drinks ever worry things like healthcare, sick leave, getting education training.

It's good system works weird perverse way everything's good, like said current situation unsustainable. bad enough everybody cable news channel regurgitate opinions back call ""news"". everybody also endless conspiracy theory videos chain-watch YouTube, filling heads garbage.

YouTube algorithms keep feeding similar [junk ingested plateful bullshit seemed like it.  Anything get watch ads. Screw him. Dude corrupt. burned 2020 bingo card murder hornets Think people lose jobs businesses close down. definitely harming MILLIONS exchange POTENTIALY saving tens thousands. make sense close places. know risk go assume responsibility like adult. Oh fuck, Monday?!?! Tomorrow might especially ugly CA, that’s good jump see Trump symptom. Ignorance, hate, racism, selfishness preexisting conditions. bring super powered AC inside body somehow? Oh OK good. 😊 wife 2016 “Well, reality TV, failed businessman narcissist least entertaining..... God help us real crisis like another 9-11 , Katrina, pandemic something...” don't. people do. perfectly normal advertise disinterest thing, give shot. Joe Rogan kicking heavy bag extra hard rn I'm making moves Wisconsin, workplace terrible policies need save numbers OK right now. Stay safe buddy o7 also- lot rents...well, pretty much them, high market bear. used two-flat, lived one unit, rented other. set rent based similar properties area...our personal expenses really figure it- took could get. even then. death certificate faked make seem worse is. know rest sub I've burned enough ""Good News"" shrug there's separate study confirms.

Besides epidemiologists strangely reluctant say long term immunity.  read wait... Buy crypto gold afford it. Yeah, normal sense, that's happens. triage typical ED, they're basically ranking heart attacks vs common colds devoting resources (staff, beds, equipment, etc) appropriately... heart attack hypothetical situation, common cold wait. sense, triage result death person waiting, common cold treated resources free up.

However, triage takes another dimension times mass casualty/pandemic, things differ one patient next age/underlying health/ability get have. way prioritize patients they're verge death disease state - covid19 related respiratory failure - prioritize likely survive/get use finite resources, gain treatment. longer prioritizing different diseases, prioritizing actually help. give vent 20 year old rather 87 year old - 20 year old likelier bounce back likely years left - 87 year old dies.

""Triage"" word came assessing wounded battlefield designating individuals certain categories. far gone save; could save enough resources/personnel; definitely save bc likely survive good outcome; need emergent medical intervention, get eventually; etc. 

There exactly perfect categories like though. There's lot art weighing costs/benefits decisions. Hospitals often ethics boards, even lot times decision might need made immediately physician 2+ patients verge death. got flour first time week since March... Thank you. child 12. could postviral syndrome. every major illness leaves people different got sick. people hospitalized today 6 years 2014 ebola epidemic due post viral syndrome. students lack household internet access, pandemic, 70% received breakfast lunch governmental free reduced priced meal programs. say that, resistance bands true substitute weight training, I've definitely made decent progress past months set heavy duty bands pull bar. “Knucklehead” NJ term ever. 

That “fucker”

Edit:spelling Muh freedom Bring zombies thing missing... Amiright? 
I Love 2020. 

Let's get on.. fair Bill, figuring trump. could ever known imbecil could get elected. Posted article two months back exactly issue - implications public safety vaccine comes anti-vaxxers refuse take it. mods took article minute saying post removed ""There many places online discuss conspiracies speculate. ask here."" Well congratulations, 'conspiracy' news. hasn’t even three months since shutdown March we’ve already improved way treat disease.

We already changed way treat disease. Whether changes improvement remains seen.

Hospitals started treating patients hydroxychloroquine based early reports, example. Later stopped, data showed actually harmful.  someone dropped almost $500 annual gym membership mid-February, think self-pity argument incorrect.

With everything known virus transmissions, gyms seem like perfect way spread them. Would never work here, hUmAn riGhTs #Cali living rest days....so probably week. UK messaging first sound: Stay home- protect NHS - save lives. really effective showed individuals could play part stopping health systems becoming overwhelmed help fellow man. mad think US world leaders advertising communication come together produce public health messaging everyone could get behind. support mask wearing, much like vaccines, doesn’t work. 

The Federal Government doesn’t General police power actually make mandate masks nationally. can't read filters work. point still stands, using animal overly elongated telomeres studies, really know serious side effect.  mean, know true fucking VIRUS yet. So.... thanks pointing back source, I'll check later. California. That’s binnnnngooooooOoooo !!!! 😁 everyone dies others report opposite everyone certain age. add folks scared get treatment conditions already fear getting sick... included numbers yet death toll down... strange isn’t explain deaths March/April matter States safe **now**?

Only relevant thing look at:

* New York (500-700 new cases/day): Texas (5,000-7,000 new cases/day): majority voters. remains necessity educate show true reality America world. Maybe sole reason existence act example others do.

Harsh, perhaps honest. know. long. 

Here's good primer possibilities currently thing seems pretty clear significant amount post-infection chronic fatigue. 50% SARS survivors did, CDC estimates 25% COVID-19 survivors do. mean growing evidence possibility maybe, might long term affects.

Sounds solid DE-FUND POLICE!

ENFORCE MASK MANDATE!!

which le redditors? get mine behind Arby's. I'll try overpass. Variety spice life say. self report. Great. care. I'm done it. I'll continue voting supporting candidates promise bring pricing protections USA like every decent country has. name recognition. 3 weeks figure bit much opinion. covidtracking made good graph this. Delay infection reported death average 27 days. assume average delay infection recorded case around 6 days, would 3 weeks case report **peak** deaths specific day cases reported.

But **average**. standard deviation symptom onset death according CDC 7.5, average 14, huge range. truly increase cases without corresponding decrease CFR, one would expect increase deaths lot earlier 3 weeks, albeit slow one start. There'd probably increase like 10-15 days.

Just imagine this: Assume 100 days 1000 cases CFR 1%. day 101, theres 100'000 CFR 1%. back 1000 cases next 100 days

When would peak deaths be? around 3 weeks.

When would deaths start going baseline 10 deaths/day? lot earlier 3 weeks. studied conclusion**, true asymptomatic fraction influenza virus infections may depend infections identified, found quite different estimates asymptomatic fraction two different types studies. outbreak investigations infections virologically confirmed, found pooled mean 16% (95% CI: 13%, 19%) infections longitudinal studies infections identified using serology point estimates asymptomatic fraction adjusted illness causes fell range could fully explain differences scale estimates two types studies, although features respective analyses would led under- over-estimation asymptomatic fraction respectively. study Vietnam include strategies, estimating asymptomatic fraction 45% (17%–77%) outbreak investigations versus 86% (82%–89%) longitudinal serologic analysis (27, 35). One potential approach resolve differences would hybrid study, intensive follow-up frequent virologic testing regardless illness throughout influenza season used ascertain infections illnesses cohort. So... vaccine ready noon?

Why using half-day stupid metaphor anyway? I'm sure laymen able answer questions accurately. Probably things like relying exclusively anecdotal evidence makes sound like crazy Australia denier. There's usually middle ground, pandemic real fact 120k deaths spite draconian methods speaks bad could done nothing.

Also, people justifiably angry friends family die due covid still people think overblown fake. Well, think I'd hire run advertising campaign adult response pandemic. Spanish Flu ran approx. February 1918 April 1920. last large Ebola outbreak ran December 2013 January 2016. think selling large tract American people short announcing anarchy streets. (Although admit ""under present management"" premise unwarranted) wonder discussion would gone anyone coughed room. That's dumbest comparison think I've ever heard, whatever. That's country shut April. Aye! SHREDS! HIV also RNA virus, it’s different kind (a “retrovirus”) transcribes RNA DNA puts DNA cell.

Basically, it’s completely different ballgame compared standard RNA viruses (like SARS-CoV-2) DNA viruses. virus remarkably vulnerable far UV light gets crushed beloved son.

...this may scientific sentence. normalize data include increase testing, [it doesn’t look Haha there’s even warrant arrest Donald Trump set Iran Maybe stop pandering people? enabling stupid. thats r/selfawarewolves crap. people need forced go back school oh god. sucks. creeps refuse wear mask allow anyone tell do, turn around try force idiocy people trying right thing! Hypocrites!

When go shopping right store opens morning go. cuts amount idiots sure. think humans different chimps something it’s safe chimps unlikely safe humans? Humans Chimpanzees exceptionally closely related, split 4-8 million years ago. evolutionary terms, that’s lot time all.

To put perspective- humans chimpanzees closely related enough human chimp could probably produce offspring. still really bad Arizona averaging like 3k cases day thought going around 6k. Regardless, Arizona still hell right now. 

And Arizona fair share old people. Due little humidity, lot elderly seem like retire AZ. Even though personally, find insane, since Arizona becomes scorching hot Sun Summer. normalize data include increase testing, [it doesn’t look hang local highway overpass, they'll find you.  quality same, price right Yes, absolutely wrong IMHO. national pandemic requires national strategy.  still waiting *scientific studies*, bro. k everyone following rules SoCal. there's growing evidence longterm damage survivors I’m heart transplant recipient. caused develop Diabeties. didn’t ask heart transplant Diabeties I’d dead @ 19 didn’t get done. result compromised immune system Diabeties due steroid medications keep alive daily basis.

But dumb ignorant ass CHOICE shred compassion around can’t protect themselves. help prevent patients/staff(medical non medical) getting sick following simple brain dead guidelines set forth keep everyone safe prevent community spread. enough compassion others? compassion all? US testing Oh, said me. think try meditation. tried months living extreme fear even poking head window.

You really nothing substance say, insulting me. still BLM Pride. always hateful people resort insults someone else feels differently. It’s really sad. Even Northeast US standards, lame call AZ ""locked down"" right normalize data include increase testing, [it doesn’t look can't really disagree.  
That makes sad McPherson.  impression least somewhat forward thinking there. trial participants tested positive COVID-19

I’m guessing it’s this. tested positive good bit getting vaccine that’s bad news. Adios, troll. Latest news coronavirus &lt;- Even order minimal compliance. Mountainside Gym isn’t closing defying order I’m expecting see nearly impact hopes given ubiquitous resistance. Well guess I’m turning garage office next 5yrs drug hard make.

I thought really laborious Remdesivir requires ""70 raw materials, reagents, catalysts"" make, approximately ""25 chemical steps.""[60] ingredients extremely dangerous humans, especially trimethylsilyl cyanide.[60] original ***end-to-end manufacturing process required 9 12 months*** go raw materials contract manufacturers finished product, restarting production January, Gilead Sciences able find ways reduce production time ***six months***.[60] appears Gilead planning working Indian companies make it: TIL per capita death toll stupid metric fit desired narrative Thanks, thanks.

Sincerely,

Australia Turns whole nation drinking anti-vax coolaid along. normalize data include increase testing, [it doesn’t look see first death due lack hospital capacity I'll change opinion, crying cry we've heard time again. First PPE, Ventilators... effective feadmongering March, tired old.  people want go bars want sit restaurants drink going drive rural areas bring virus goes.

*Yikes.* We're actually pushing people rural areas drink. REALLY hope get one Fall ! #What expect leaders give shit? US EU ?  I’m not. I’m leaving everyday pissed government leaders president (he’s definitely leader) fucking population. Unfortunately general public listen scientists doctors instead take cue brain dead government officials. None people know things. Maybe need better friends/fam/acquaintances? honestly, genius. put price tag ears perk up. obviously ""do right thing"" ""be good person"" approach work guaranteed shitface white house like ""wait *what*?"" hears this. actually found posted Canada actually extended ban travel July 31st. 

I certainly expect remain shut whole year. thought July 1st seemed bit soon, seems Canadian government agrees. Hopefully another month things improved open. keep mind basically every virologist world working one disease, time. 

I want baby next month. go impregnate 9 women today, doable. Right? Nothing done says country happens regularly...  people believe life special yet okay everyone getting virus dying ""get with."" entitled people cost us months lives people distancing everything possible stay safe still end getting virus due ignorance lack care. normalize data include increase testing, [it doesn’t look highly contagious didn’t everyone mom catch already? didn’t brothers entire warehouse catch get sick (they tested)? Please enlighten sea knowledge get owned standing personal, logical, rational experience months terrified end world infection 98% survival rate. Please, explain didn’t get sick? af please majority people can't work home. essentially talking kids missing entire year education. surely work well. We'll pay stay home!

That's really need we're getting. Forcing people work killing people. Went testing today. expecting nasal swab nasal throat. like feeling something stuck throat. Fingers crossed. Hopefully comes back negative. Oh trend shit south obvious.

As population density, guess makes sense different population densities different rules ""Wear Mask, Ventilator."" - needs T-shirt. know anything Goldman Sachs know they're constantly wrong, makes actually con pro-mask message unfortunately. nation karen's tell ya.... Funny thing nobody gym (LA Fitness) previous gym looks like that. Heck 1 sleeved tatted look like normal chilled dude, happens lift shape lol. Ironically chicks I've seen tatted dudes.

This whole time, even back March, can't even trace anything gyms here. 2 cases, that's it. meanwhile protest thousand thousand people allowed...... god forbid bbq 5 people I'm grandma killer cause end civilization.

Meanwhile family members ER docs here, states including CO CT, well nurses know two street alone covid icu wings South FL. Heck CDC admitted 20 million actually have/had including likely know, showing less less risky truely is. think maybe people care 1M I'm really starting think numerical figure change people's attitudes. Sadly point, race see herd immunity somehow happen mass spread death vaccine gets here. Well take it. There's significant difference mortality without it; speeds recovery would recover anyway. They're holding people's lives hostage; convenience. Weigh cost drug vs. cost days hospital. get si you. everybody.

It matter well us long plague rats like pushing dangerous behavior allowed encouraged.

No respect kind behavior face pandemic. Congrats using stupid metric.  Yeah, making crowd people cough really seems like big brain thinking stop lung based virus. correct, China victim flu came China Europe (I forgot originated).

I guess argue China failed completely control swine flu. think that's weak argument. worst worst customers always demand believe deserve best service time. think they'd smart enough avoid know severely altered dining experience. think therein lies problem. Really? Damn figures guess. Oxford vaccine, least, lot safety trials. USAmerican, basically like Mauritius: harsh lockdown, slow, gradual reopening harsh punishment violations. Lots testing contact tracing isolate new cases. no, governor Ducey knows damn well shut is. Instead, coward waited friend Donald Trump came town, held rally broke social distancing, enforce mask requirements despite heavy police presence, wear mask Air Force One. weekend announces new measurements. Ducey manipulator, coward, corporate suit. Arizona good hands. spelled independent incorrectly username. reputable infectious disease experts doctors expressed optimism effective treatment (not cure) found end year. 

As OP said, we’ve never seen kind mobilization disease human history. we’ve decades medical advancement since HIV. pandemic burnt 6 months

What? No. H1N1pdm09 still circulating flu strain. predominant strain several flu seasons since 2009 2013-2014 2015-2016 flu seasons. vaccine H1N1pdm09 still part seasonal flu shot. H1N1 portion vaccine since 2010-2011 flu season. heard northern California people little kooky, didn’t know coronavirus denier levels crazy. report it, happening. get 50%? definitely correct certain % long term lifetime impact, sad still don’t know enough virus, won’t know many years long term damage be, know everyone infected long term issues, people taking seriously really respecting risk unknown I’ve quarantining could give list I’ve contact with. 

However, realize quarantine isn’t possible everyone, regrettably, people choose limit contact.  Way ahead ya, buddy. Working leveling second WoW alt now. woman EVER want touch penis now!  country doomed. many people like you. forgot mask. mistake I’m genuinely worried yet today coworker told ""I seen news hospitals filling recently."" don’t feel like need it

This line reasoning caused current surge cases US. Young healthy people said didn’t feel like needed stop going bars, said didn’t feel like needed wear masks, etc. excuses going come steep cost. Tbh, see going end worse adults cause small time delay.

And least live grow parents live see grow. Yeah, hot food too, although microwave whatever get still steaming hopefully little safer (with couple risky exceptions, namely rare cold dipping sauce drink).  lived decade. don’t need anything explained. lived it, got tired it, left. absolutely disgusting, problem government job here. help rent. help mortgages. extra unemployment ends July 31st. would government job policies want hated 30-40% country unknown reason. want mention politics much, one side country shutdowns, masks, government helping rent money. people currently charge.

There help businesses impacted pandemic. help people work: delay bills payments landlords banks, actual relief. What's point help pay back giant lump sum months can't afford? Exactly. Dead people bar patrons, bars care. hard feel empathy someone empathy themselves.

Given almost none wearing mask hard believe enforcing restrictions bar.

We could done much better people simply care. pretty much seeing picture. confirm many panhandle idiots. ""have"" live currently never lived selfish place. Racism anti-science rhetoric alive well here. I'm never going able leave house point. Like giving debate questions candidate? Yes vanity,some politics stupidity 3... Aren’t STD’s sexual transmitted though? better walk shot cannon. Could elaborate? agree people hold reasonable positions, find hard believe cannot leverage find middle ground someone - matter polarized politics are. 

Yes, it’s hard one blink tell someone reasonable opinion something. Yes humble find middle ground. start somewhere. Throwing hands saying “it’s possible right now” give compromise need ever. Agree. Mass everyone following rules. Yep soon ""lockdown"" relaxed bit, people assumed defeated corona life instantly back normal. it’s perfect world? Obviously it’d great pandemic could end everyone could get risk, that’s reality. Especially glorious leader right now, there’s reality except one people ultimately going risk shit unfortunately sacrifices. Obviously governments willing make choice. It’s doubtful change you’re left much choice except hope best take precautions lol won’t get sound like darth vader maybe 1% take better care slaves. could use housing assistance real riots (civil war) gonna start happening healcare really soon fear. would've thought holding prom balls middle pandemic poor idea? There's limit number people could hospitalized product life cycle drug. can't catch type-1 diabetes, ANYONE get COVID-19. Hence, target market magnitudes larger outrageously priced drugs. guys defending shit work big pharma? Orange County open, they’ll advocating 0 mask usage 0 social distancing recent town hall meeting indicator. Add holiday top holy sheep shit Batman I’d put serious money shitshow

By way, what’s over/under reverse town hall meeting OC time crazies scream government didn’t enough keep protected? 4 weeks? 2 months? Idk exactly 100% expect see happen bread butter General Motors. one big truck plants would affect suppliers country. Maybe should, since premise flawed young woman's account correct started experiencing symptoms day protest. novel coronavirus's incubation period short (2-14 days, getting symptoms five days), making highly unlikely got protest. problem argument losing everything better enforcing social distancing masks that, could remained open. group, didn't, people became sick, going cause millions billions health care, mention people die illness. could careful weren't, ways lack concern lost businesses. someone explain rise cases least part due rise testing. 

I genuinely understand tests naturally equal positive case results. We’ve actually hit near identical mark yearly mortality average Every single point made backed *scientific* studies. point, trolling willfully ignorant don’t know basic things. I’ll glad dig one showing high mask usage protests, like, it’s common knowledge takes 5 days become contagious, symptoms show days. words, timeline literally doesn’t fit current spike cases caused events 4 weeks ago. cases would shown 2 weeks ago, not, haven’t shown data, logic, *scientific* study showing plausible mechanism occur.

Until show something like that, done, I’ll assume you’re arguing bad faith. Relax. Unless Chinese pig Evidence shows virus already passed animals humans. However, evidence yet could passed humans humans. researchers believe imminent threat ""Every indication G4 virus would undergo evolutionary change spread readily people, may never that,"" tweeted Carl Bergstrom, biologist University Washington.

It's likely China edge Covid-19 army scientists tests looking threats could there. Pools Closed due coronavirus would happening NY MN IL etc... going make doses aren’t bringing money it?

They didn’t anything extra year develop it, drug ever mass produced. Scaling manufacturing distribution considerable task.  Projecting again? got sick, yes. massive influx under-30 people testing positive states. Survive? Almost people survive this. sad state affairs people selfish entitled might die, immediately later, little anti-mask tantrums. must fun parties. many times cook tried poison you? brother SIL live coast N.C. dread hurricane season every year. China lot bigger Wuhan. vast majority people don’t fly Wuhan travel Wuhan. However, verify China go Wuhan. 

Also, turns out, virus [much deadly type “A” China [~28.7% blood type population vs US making deadly US carrying people China carry virus symptoms. (Remember tests available)

Also, common sense measure, place stayed long higher chance contracting something vs traveling through. 

Also, source virus tend higher resistance area. Making certain viruses seem almost population nationality centric. Well no... actually way off, know so, one would expect, assumptions gotten situation completely wrong. Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Looks like lot people gonna trouble breathing soon 👀 think understood comment, I'll blame clear. I'll try again: 

So many people died NYC (and Lombardy), even every single person ALREADY caught virus, death rate would higher .2% based amount deaths current have. 

It literally impossible .2% death rate .27% city's population already died COVID-19. 

Even everyone caught virus ALREADY deaths point on, would .27%. Death toll Florida alone massive. understand 200k high estimate. lol hitting 10m deaths estimated cfr even entire US caught would see deaths 3m range. terrifying part, didnt even occur us. even ""beat"" virus, yeah....

We people never realize care this, thinking eh flu kills old people, idea cost ignorance Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* reverse batman common one see.

It's funnier reverse batman becomes Anti-Sneeze guard. people aware that, yaknow, *sneeze*, mucous coming **nose**?  I'm saying I'd rather George Bush junior leader right now... Houston, we've got problem. wear mask 8 hours day. job one vulnerable I'd dead. 

Go ask everyone else sacrifice get mad sacrifice enough. Someone know works prison Florida multiple people respiratory illness never tested. nasty cold can't taste anything spent two solid days trying get tested employer stay home unless positive test result. one place county currently offering tests out.

As bad Florida's numbers work, sure much worse reality due clusterfuck response causing poor availability testing thus likely positive patients continuing expose dozens people. talking dude 70+ already decades lifting, hell it, plus Arnnie home gym would embaress gyms. lift I'm active surfing etc. same. bodyweight bands (of majority Chinese shit also break). broke 5 bands including setup 150lbs. one resistance bands remotley lifting weights due actual band resistance changes.

Few neighbors did, friends same. Still felt like shit whole 3 months that. Last 4 weeks gym, feel incredible already broke dead lifting March. We've waiting Gold Man Sacks speak! sense flippity-flop coming certain politicians.

Hell, already saw Pence. Suddenly Mr. Mask reconvention Symbolic Scientists Squad, Trump golfing paying attention. rarely go Facebook sides argument. lefts virtue signaling fucking smug rights dumbassery hoax talk. 

Fucking awful now. really go see friends cute babies.  China right now. Military first. guess they're called ""conscripts..."" conscripted prescripted. getting take least week. Prices going - damn worth it. got go pho banh mi. good stuff! Pho together got home (toss beef, noddles toppings kept separate broth). craving good chinese. Sadly many good chinese places area. I'm right you. boil down, people make good decisions based data evidence, thing hope sake sake love learn hard way, refuse learn easy way. bonkers. blame one bit! There’s also lot info that’s widely known, like virus gets nervous system organs. Also, young people getting life-threatening immune reactions many people recover lifelong issues lung scarring more. indications virus infect heart causing problems later life similar rheumatic fever. they’re overwhelmingly right. They’re assuming it’s big deal fact it’s huge deal kill tomorrow immediately. flu spreads Europe China causes half pigs die China? absolutely talk raw numbers compared ratios

Alright, guess clarify whether talking raw numbers vs ratios initial comment. 

IMO, tell typical person reduction mortality rate around 5%, first thing think drug resulted 5% less people dying. pretty disingenuous reality 40% less people died treatment.


As side note, would useful talk raw numbers? 

For example, I'm baseball player currently hit 1 home run every 100 hits (1/100 = 1% home run rate) year training able hit 10 home runs every 100 hits (10/100 = 10% home run rate) would say I'm 9% better hitting home runs? I'm clearly hitting home runs 10 times often would say I'm 10 times better. virus burn rate transmission 1. (R0 &lt; 1).

No one knows how's exactly infectious COVID-19 is, assumed COVID-19 R0 2 3, numbers thrown around way are. Basically, there's formula Herd Immunity:

**Herd Immunity = (R0 - 1.0) / R0**

|R0|Equation|Herd Immunity Percent|
|:-|:-|:-|
|COVID-19 assuming R0 = 2|(2.0 - 1.0) / 2.0|50.0%|
|COVID-19 assuming R0 = 2.5|(2.5 - 1.0) / 2.5|60.0%|
|COVID-19 assuming R0 = 3.0|(3.0 - 1.0) / 3.0|66.6%|
|Polio (R0 \~ 5)|(5 - 1.0) / 5|80.0%|
|Measles (R0 \~ 12)|(12 - 1.0) / 12|91.6%|
|COVID-19 Masks / Social Distancing (R0 \~ 0.5 )|(0.5 - 1.0) / 0.5|\-50.0% (Herd Immunity Necessary Contain Outbreak)| ah see man culture well eat tacos mask on? Hello dying hallways waiting room. many people weeks months ago claiming there's plenty hospital capacity.

Well, may been, there's not. Making profits great again!! right spread mainly droplets. meant face shield much easily lets either in. That’s fine Yikes! many Americans instead ""fuck it, one time $1200 check long since run out, need money get kicked house"". American entitlement exceptionalism, though agree playing role. mask issue blown political. Nobody GAD shoes, shirt, service. certain political party though great idea make public health crisis R vs L issue.

Idiots. Even stupid bigger Texas. reduces stress?

Ok never enough amount small business are. jogging, hiking, walking? would go crazy work day. Helps reset brain. poster another Covid article made comment people won’t take seriously it’s one degree removed them. sudden get real. 
That true. Saying would take amount time go 50k 100k 25k 50k exponential growth. Linear growth would saying takes amount time go 50k 75k 25k 50k. think us mask wearing people wouldn’t making big stink people wearing mask put risk. would sad, would lives would risk. It’s like freedom wear seatbelt. Unfortunately, potentially putting everyone else risk don’t wear one need wear keep thing getting worse. mean right already hates freaking embrace it. Go whole hog. Save lives expense pissing people. mean bartender started. chance hell im going back. Good time get industry. actually got sick day march,” said Turner. “I could move bed. bed sighing.”

Sounds like caught march then. friends possibly caught independent march. There's actually nothing article pack headline. Trump prediction complete sustained collapse around christmas time. half americans don’t job anymore, really think people gonna celebrating spending money gifts there’s jobs available? Yay! Optimism going cure many covid patients thoughts prayers do. rest world seems done democracies largely problems thing. price freedom includes ability force people stay homes weeks/months time. Yea super dumb shit mortgage payments postponed top rent postponements existing eviction preventions. situation banks need take hit kept afloat via means problem subsides. manageable also brought christ? Thank you. would genuine effort press focused much attention versus causing division. event April with, I'm guessing, little national coverage. reminds 7/11 gives free stuff July 11th. forget next 7/11. Meanwhile, there's 24/7 event involving one person. number shot Chicago 1,508 morning. Probably higher now. app showed yesterday's numbers. says new cases June 30 4669 - also 41% positive. Keep mind hard get test do, often results take week. Closing bars, gyms, movie theaters hardly shut I'll give USD 3.00 per liter gm's plasma know works places, LA County I've gotten tested times, take drivers license number unique identifier, presumably dedupe test results scenarios talking about.  Chinese willing go extreme lock everyone wear masks citizens die. Meanwhile US people go parties put others risk feel comfortable wearing masks. So, yeah, quite obvious side superior humanity respecting individuals safety now. Yes! particularly hate “how many hugs” commercial. I’m thousand miles away family idea I’ll able safely see again; please stop reminding ugh must proud Science tells us close exceeding capacity treat people need hospital support. 

Yes, flexible nose piece, air escape upwards. majority not. (As aside, mentally challenged individuals may need coached placing glasses top mask secure keep fogging glasses). even achieved Mayberry status yet. Mayberry cared other. one's talking people getting evicted losing jobs businesses never reopening.

The media us attack click bait Karen's like automatons Oh man.... hope family friends get better soon. :(

&amp;#x200B;

Same mask thing. Previous administrations fine pandemics, compared rest world.

There's something abnormally terrible administration... I'm sorry conspiracy run Bill Gates. would disease 5-14 day incubation period take 6-7 weeks show increase cases? Particularly 10-14 days surge new cases nationwide, sprawling, massive protests? 

You think coronavirus was, month, secretly hiding among carriers waiting prefect time show certain US political party bad light attacked host? majority time restaurant wearing mask, building larger larger cloud germs around eventually mingle fug coming tables. deaths 4 weeks ago? 1,500 tests whole state though? come ramp up. wearing mask protect mask wearer 
So wear mask better chance getting sick, better chance getting someone else sick happens seasonal flu starts going around. I'm medical expert, could covid somehow merge flu? happens then?  Cool, two NY cars visiting neighbors MO leave, thanks.
Don't hate them, appropriate time. Let educate fact virus spreading ever increasing pace exponential rate that's viruses do.

Add fact there's grossly high false negative rate tests, death rates grossly underreported false claims pneumonia deaths opposed covid deaths

I'd like see numbers align claims, literally anyone see fatality rate covid far exceeds flu.

Not mention batshit insane downplay deaths caused covid, secondary effects has, downplay immense suffering people covid-19 go through.

Your reply biggest reaction major issue history world. Chips what? Track buy, see, go, copy whatever passwords type etc?

Why would bill gates go many lengths get data, paying money anyway. live central Ohio noticed gas stations around took plexiglass dividers stopped wearing masks. Anyone else seen happening area? Sunlight winter works well takes longer less hours sunlight failure government. exactly trying warn hoping prevent. Nobody wanted listen much worse. 

Was ego hubris, negligence incompetence, above? Weird protesters NY Boston get sick rate higher general public. like governor trying find scapegoat reopening failure. FL TX need follow suit..not sure taking long. Ducey announced state closed bars, gyms movie theatres 30 days, amid rise state also shut water parks reopened May, Mr Ducey imposed limit 50 people gatherings indoors outdoors ppl start giving efff start seeing kind die NYC places like Houston FL. Panic induces behavior changes masses. point self-imposed lock-down. Friends neighbors stop socializing ppl stop patronizing retail shops unnecessarily. keep mind even Sweden institute closures lockdowns, infection rate &amp; mortality rate stabilized public got fearful &amp; became anti-social. Stockholm never reached anywhere near 60 70% infection rate needed herd immunity. Here's Georgia's latest case/death charts, 7-day running averages: here's ranking US counties per capita death. Georgia top 4 slots! What's stars next states? worries! check everyday 11am updates total. comes straight state gov compiling county data, it’s accurate possible. Good news made 6 months muslims pork game facilities disabling exact reason (see: airports, restaurants). bc see PRESIDENT TV wearing mask, they? That's see charts. see lag two weeks. That's also see home Illinois charts. week/two-week lag uptick cases deaths. American here. (1/2 lingual) one language, eh.

Cheers Mate, safe! cannot even find N95s buy. open everything get already. 99,6% population survive. 

They dont even know vaccine made, let alone when. what's point restrictions? They're delaying inevitable.

I'm gonna get downvoted oblivion sounds hard going live sort 'stay home' dystopia? Fauci grouchy guy changes mind whether vaccine coming soon daily basis. depending side on, use ""there may never vaccine"" supplement arguments pro anti lockdown. would implement national plan recommendations? civilian representing civilians United States unite effort states took instead fight science care money saving lives... approached it

Based recommendations CDC, Fauci, Surgeon General. paying people? Don’t forget people survive long lasting health issues.  OK - show evidence proves purified particles used? /r/covid19positive Want know MASK thing?

OK, looks like WSJ tagline title sloppy translation vaccine efficacy minimum 50% compared placebo control. I’ve read reports say individuals infected SARS show little symptoms infected SARS-COV-2. guess would people show little symptoms likely recently caught coronavirus. 15-30% viruses cause “common cold”. Perhaps people still lingering antibodies cold got winter? Also, I’ve also read children susceptible catching known coronaviruses, perhaps that’s children show milder symptoms? Honestly, I’m afraid I’ll family gets sick dies. I’ll survive, mean I’ll people denied aren’t wearing masks, going beach 4th (and know way fucking many).  ""Water Wet"" says Scientist

""Fake News"" says President Except number daily cases growing exponentially. population infected, R0 goes down.  really name? Sounds very. ""interesting"" oh know site, thanks sharing! Musk go shove Mars rock butt I'd refuse both. Thanks CDC. what's damning hiding possibility came pigs everybody knows h1n1 swine flu. coronaviruses known infect pigs well, yet nobody's looking see sars-cov-2's intermediate hosts pigs. would explain many pork plants center outbreak lot states us. increase hospitalizations Texas, Arizona states must *false* hospitalizations, obvi^ous^ly. shrewd! third 3,500 inmates incarcerated San Quentin State Prison California tested positive coronavirus Monday. 

Holy shit, need get somehow. may committed felonies letting people die inhumane. Clearly He’s deep point spelled EH wrong. it’s okay, forgiven. Check California couple weeks. assumption weren’t really “asymptomatic” Remember people thought Musk modern day Edison? 😂

Ya, reputation aging well quote Pres Facebook groups area listing businesses mandate don’t well restaurants delivery drivers masks, etc. Downfall FB, still helpful information. Monday reported cases midsummer weekend. FHM sheet it’s correct day test.

So cases Thursday 11:00 Monday 11:00

EDIT downloaded ECDC sheet. cases 20, 21 22 June. there’s 2889 cases 23rd. guess hid cases week before? Silly unhide week after. national government USA works. I'll straight: dont know differences different types christianity.

I meant: people dont listen pope authority outside US.

Idk sects cause... kind blur me. would thought decades anti-science anti-intellectual rhetoric peddled likes Fox News Donald Trump would backfire pandemic. family owns restaurants fine carry-out only. think allowing dine-in eating absolutely insane, right Please look list developed nations. I'm using ""third world shithole"" example.    

You could argue size, density, politics etc makes poor model pick call shithole blatantly bias. report week 25 said 61,803 tests positive rate 12%.

It's great news number tests seems approaching level accurate assessment spread infection made.

However, lower percentage positive tests still resulted higher number reported infections, week 25 7,470 confirmed cases.

This means either testing enough, number cases per day increasing. Good post people comment, thanks OP Disasturbation makes blind, kids. longer union citizens. fractured. definitely false. people won’t regret wearing mask, factually. fuck would go bar anyway. stay hell home, watch tv, listen music drink there. Cheaper, safer drive home! advice great anytime, pandemic. Bars stupid became cop means continue socially distance, rest little easier big risk something like park bench is.

This matter someone coughs you, matter terms handle sanitation public spaces. Bring mf  Law student here, making bar online test HORRIBLE idea ethics/protecting integrity exam That’s science works. Information changes new challenges breakthroughs discovered. dude job presenting date information. Fauci lie masks? going say “duh” realized oh... people still don’t won’t listen... death counts low people care rule thumb real number cases detected number times 10.

So 10 × 40 000 detected = 400 000 real (per day).

If rises number Fauci dreads, would 10 × 100 000 detected = 1 000 000 real (per day).

By way, imagine total number detected cases goes 3M. would 30M real cases. would mean nearly every 10th person USA (population 328M) would contracted SARS-CoV-2! I’ve socially isolating months. enjoyed wasn’t worried world. means 50% transmission without known link, way high point view. 

Something also stated can't ne reiterated enough:
""These findings highlight need anyone COVID-19–compatible symptoms avoid public settings isolate persons, even within household, possible"" Fauci looks like he's tantrum people trust lies anymore. He's bed Bill Gates slimy people. People want microchips like friend Bill wants wonder much money pharmaceuticals.... bar exam could super spreading event lot states, mandating masks said, hard (8 hour) exam course several days would hard enforce. exam takes place prime conditions (indoor, air conditioned, enclosed) conditions spread well. mention delays bar occurred place huge hardship would attorneys *can’t work* pass “Many people saying disappear summer. believe heat kill it.” No, math. Real-world factors influence that. 10%

Divide ~20 can't prove long vehicle state, residence, zero obligation register there.  asked self isolate waits results?  Same, refuse dine indoors go gym right even though it’s open, maybe patio seating dinner outside tables spaced properly good. thats low sample space. Maybe future trials give indication, nice know. Yup. know matter choice make, they’re going live doubt guilt rest life made right one. Especially someone gets worse passes choice, it’s awful devastating healthcare professionals getting point...it never way. Sweden fewer cases Denmark. pretty convincingly shown spread Sweden significantly higher surrounding countries lockdowns implemented (week 11-12). Far difference deaths Nordic countries attributed earlier spread Sweden, significant portion. 

The red bars mark deaths 3 weeks following lockdowns/restrictions Sweden, Denmark, Norway Finland. incubation period plus average time symptoms death, deaths period wasn’t affected restrictions, since individuals mostly infected implementation. Sweden’s curve pre-implementation deaths much earlier steeper Nordic countries. flyover planes? I'm sure help major issue west unelected business owners investors lobbying government premise funding party. always happened - however sums dough recent times ridiculous. turn led cycle business promoted good news stories need reopen media sponsored business owners investors coupled current conservative* ideology - money first, life distant second.

I said long long time ago. can't faff around LockDown, properly don't. properly wasted limited time had, governments held account massively messed up. Viruses happen throughout history, happen lessons need learnt.

But people charge learn lessons history prioritising personal gain time served relationships, ethics, strategies common sense end here. pseudo argument masks pathetic.

The places virus exploding locked work. need socially distance, wear mask wash hands regularly. rocket science tee. Locking would also cost more.

This neither true valuable.

The Federal Reserve already said safely print much money necessary; national debt money we've largely borrowed myself.

And lot expensive keep people healthy flood hospitals, scramble resource shortages, long lasting chronic illnesses. thought maybe dozen Americans disease, traveled internationally, wearing mask without sign infection seemed like drastic step.

Realistically March saw widespread information symptom free communication. really needed switch ""you may sick know take appropriate steps"" mode.

Even today message still clearly communicated. never see phrased directly personally: **You, yes YOU, may sick right know yet. Act accordingly.** Yeah I'm entrepreneur lost business ten years. lay everyone yes I'm unemployment. call vacation government give free money (I live US.)

But that's he's talking about. He's saying ""prisoners homes."" That's job loss. That's kind emotional sense freedom. 

Not everyone great life family lot people bad situations. compassion situation. people acting like *because mall closed* ""living life."" dunno man, people need get creative. shops closed hurts shop owners always customers vocal angry. want served. want fun shit. Sorry, get pandemic find new hobby wait out. think people past?? Read book drink home like normal person instead spreading disease ""felt like going out."" use dramatic language make sound like going INTOLERABLE. get together friend two, drink stoop, call mum, even date apps certain extent. I'm sorry need creative instead trying go back normal. Maybe think bit. googling. Ask friend. l nothing compared ancestors went survive going pub bit. good. tiniest bit research you’ll learn false positives incredibly fucking rare diagnostic swabs resources retest positive tests. Especially retesting negatives actually false fairly often We're probably well beyond 100k/day right - confirmed....  brief run like mid March stuff like beans pasta frozen food weeks people realized stores would remain open. 

There issue TP that’s TP supply chain makes TP home work, WFH nobody using work TP, ratio wack it’s adjusted since. haven’t trouble finding anything since late March except handful specific meat products. Fauci co knew early masks helped reduce spread. due shortage masks, colleagues knowingly lied public. outright admitted it. can't lie public something fundamental expect public believe going forward. hope learned lesson. Tbh kind relevant. millions people displaced, killing rise likely mess seeing US handling things far. kind assumed intense heat low humidity arizona would buffer, guess not. love businesses can’t see past month out. I'm nervous started coughing pretty badly today, cant really get work get tested (I tried get appointment) area. might shortness breath can't tell I'm slightly weight live extremely hot humid area. mention we're going dust storm could allegies, infection rates also going area? Really question tell shortness breath actually shortness breath environment panic settling in. feel really stupid asking this.  comment actually Game Thrones reference lol US population 100,000 WW1 bad comparison. right higher chance die American WW1 right covid. think pass ww1 death per capita quite easily, saying worse WW1 completely ignoring population

Edit: meant 100 million. 3.3× less spreading exponential rate since December, still less 1% 1% population Earth. Still waiting link numbers mean something. 

""Add fact there's grossly high false negative rate tests, death rates grossly underreported false claims pneumonia deaths opposed covid deaths""

Youre literally making shit now. world wide news pneumonia related respiratory related illnesses reported covid deaths whether tested not. Youre literally trying flip narrative make apoint. hospitals reported chance could cause 40k pop insurance companies. 

its bat shit insane downplay numbers people numbers die every day way keep economy society continuing. make economy/societal collapse potential decisions based VULNERABLE/ELDERLY/WEAK people. exact recipe collapse. % working class risk anything common cold closer 0 1%. tell stay home dont go beach wear mask cause weakest possible subset population also 1/1000Th population COULD risk. hilarious anyone understand math economics. Sorry bunch old unhealthy people died dont know, going die anyways basically anythnig affected immune system. hate one tell everyone dies end death inevitable part existence spend money people closest death protect extend life entire world collapse. Actually, i'll sleep 2025. Maybe even 2030, economic crisis gets really bad. wow 14 year old discovered conspiracies, take easy bud! also appears white, probably get away too! mean looking you, looks like country pretty fucked long time, right? isn't. Duh Supersized first.  found studies showing asymptomatic infections Ebola. highest percentage 27%, IIRC. So, think uncommon. So, behind current knowledge covid? thought deemed blood disease respiratory disease ventilators unlikely help. true France poverty. that's point

Backup sources. proved false see above, ie USA poverty. Please proved point source please adult discussion :(I never said USA 3rd world country. wrote "" USA **similarities** countries Africa "". poor pandemic situation (number speaking themselves), us citizens even allowed come EU (European Union) travelling notice (decided today) &amp; covid reveal obvious issues US &amp; make relevant. worry, France needed WW2 wake call &amp; since national &amp; mandatory social security. that, USA expect major changes. stress wants, best get ""it's cheap, worth shot"". Strong correlation still Rogan know better quack around like that's definitely going help COVID... mocking people (then backtracking) wearing wish get sun pop vitamin good... sadly, evidence that.

I'm answering question honestly thoroughly, clearly citing also providing verifiable source discuss everything referenced. adamant insert opinion? fight what's right wrong, stop trying make one. everything fight internet... trying get protect greed! care anything else. First say weren’t joking several days later say clearly sarcastic.  STOP LISTENING BANKS. SERIOUSLY. They're absolute worst. get way warmer hard see snug face. also takes longer breathe thick filtration is. totally agree, restaurant seating outdoor. Indoor, really see keep reasonable safe. know licking door handles bus/train poles thing Arizona. Probably stop till pandemic over.   choices health care workers going make would give anybody PTSD. 

Two people come in, one bed. decide? Hope healthier one pulls try save one? Cut losses try maximize survival chances healthy one? infuriated absolutely true. swab tests highly specific covid 19 would incredibly rare get false positive. swab positive, you’re positive. common false negatives due insufficient sample. see people responding Elon saying Hes right cuz tested positive negative days later... NO, negative false test, positive. positive means covid. seriously gonna convince covid positive people it’s accident. Hes claiming fifty percent false positives zero proof cuz it’s happening all. either total idiot purposefully trying mislead public make money. scum earth. Based badly treats employees he’s tried hide positive results factories, I’m p sure purposefully malicious. Big daddy Elon scared shut sow public suspicion PANDEMIC. Moral story? Stop glorifying billionaires! evil 

I point ANTIBODY tests yield false positives completely different diagnostic test. diagnostic test said covid, absolutely covid  jerk busy trying attack strangers

No, I'm someone luxury able work home next two years trying stop people spreading fear. ability self isolate indefinitely absolutely relevant discussion. summary study Swedish strategy dealing covid-19 criticized accounting difficulties conducting voluntary social distancing settings household overcrowding, dependence public transport large proportion service sector workers. neighbourhoods typically larger proportion immigrants.

Fully summary here:  “2 weeks slow spread” “8+ weeks literal tyranny”

This people done fucking bullshit It’s almost they’re dealing totally new pathogen trying figure things real time limited information. 

Do cell phone? go doctor? ride planes ever? drive car bridges? like air conditioning? computer? trust science, every single one things science action proves overall soundness science every single day open fucking eyes  yes, laughing ass appropriate response getting disease apparently causes long-term kidney, lung, heart damage 50% cases leads neurological damage. LMFAO indeed. Hilarious. Bold assume even read. app dictate headlines immediate knee jerk reactions upon hearing them

So anyways, let tell Bill Gates guy also real problem “European countries better contained virus, Fauci said, part shutdown activities widespread. United States, half nation shut compared 90% 95% activities many European countries.” point protests course rally spread virus, hear rally press. NY contact tracers specifically instructed ask people attended protests. constitutions point establish rights mostly individual. Letting someone die necessarily lose/lose situation. really think is, try see there's proof 500k yearly influenza deaths harm economy think people missing point. inheritors wants america become shithole poor immigrate underbid us counterpart. immigration always using foreigners lower wages. US us incorporate business take advantage strong ip protection laws. 

if want fix problem destroy ip protection. remove incentives destroy us. Great. Well fucked, also shocking....but definitely scary af. ""pay applause"" dunno that, seems bit high. Even ignoring places still lockdown, would huge amount testing, like HUGE that. Look like orange-flavored suppository anymore blaming everything kind nullifies argument cheap excuse, even done shit ton wrong. doing? slowly turning damned damned don’t situation....... There's fuck people days anyway Molotovs cheaper wrong. Mask protect well. 100% though. Unlikely, even China downplay virus, numbers terrible Italy, data everyone see several Countries nothing anyway, even fun making jokes ""Corona Pizza"". Yet, still relies everyone “do right thing”, like worked first time /s  lol remotely saying yeah think ""good"" stereotypes good though. 

No one ""supposed"" good something race. 

The entire reason stereotyping wrong people judged individually labeled anything race gender.

Allowing good stereotypes fundamentally allowing stereotypes true. Ooh ok. Thanks anyway! Ducey concluded briefing started 3p. make things clearer 3 weeks. again, kids private school it’s normally 2 weeks schools. Exactly. idk wear mask that’s fucking idiotic. lots American volunteers. also lots volunteers Brazil UK. Making colonialism country UK colonize strange. Dude, think you’re *dumb shit* promise you’re way intelligent people. Really truly dumb people don’t think they’re stupid all, think they’re smart suffer insane cognitive biases. close quarters bad ventilation plus maybe singing, could go wrong?

Denial works, doesn't. wishful thinking lost. surrender. there's one surrender to. we're stuck this.

What now?

Assume life health ""essentials"". Going survival mode means living past mess. this, without putting prior expectations (and contracts) hold. attack like that.

Once understand merry-go-round stopped, cost re-starting afford pay, must decide what's really important us.

What's needed, missing, good governance. That's telling us live, giving us map what's possible now, waste limited chances nostalgia old habits.

Confirmed Cali people could care less COVID thing shit even parents aren’t even worried anymore.

Be safe everyone can’t save idiots. They're saying 30% people T-cell immunity, higher number number people antibodies.

All data suggests 30% people infected virus asymptomatic. also reason believe asymptomatic (not developed symptoms YET, never will) people significant source community spread. small percentage people might still affected, majority asymptomatic cases never found people even think get tested.

While conclusive, data suggest T-cell immunity makes people resistant COVID-19, thus making poor vectors. good, means 60% population would need actually get sick herd immunity, 85% (85% susceptible population, 70% population, approximately 60% total population). Or, make bit easier visualize, NYC halfway herd immunity Wave 1 \*\*if correct\*\* \[asymptomatic\] people look feel fine, researchers CT scan image lungs, 50 100 percent cases, actually found abnormalities,"" Oran explained. ""When look CT scans, hazy — looks like looking dirty piece glass. means there's something abnormal lungs,"" said.

More real cause alarm happening least affected covids. fairly permanent, buckle up, virus like none other. vocal fraction group love spout ""tax increases paid children, grandchildren"". larger fraction actually buy line. *As if* actually care younger generations' financial well being. Ontario, yes......30%....... misreading graphs. similar death counts three weeks, update count weekend today.

Edit: actually publish update today. checked earlier today. 12 today, always report less Monday, going today alone ignores trend previous three weeks also

Edit 2: uh, graph literally changed. No, misreading anything, figures shown before. Possibly technical error.

Here Swedish source till worldometers fixes whatever broke. like showing another country. genuinely unusual. open computer solution**: mostly figured out. Swedish Health Authority today synced data API Worldmeters uses. Swedish Health Authority shares data different way, announce new number covid-19 deaths every day, numbers publish actually deaths day, anytime previous 4 weeks, majority deaths last 2 weeks yet processed death registry. completely overwritten worldometers' data, formerly based number dead reported day, elucidating day deaths actually took place.

However, new way visualising data means majority recent deaths (i.e. last 2-3 weeks) literally absent graph.

This source visualises trend death rate respect delay reporting Swedish Health Authority: - also shows historical prediction trend, website live months now. Curiously, small uptrend forecast, apparent rapid downtrend past two weeks deaths timeframe properly processed, always case source misdirection observing trend.

From graph, see three-week period death rate really dropping, mentioned comment. end three-week period starts window deaths yet reported. quite simply, real raw data lacking, follow Swedish news, Swedish Health Authority's daily announcements (less weekends), indeed see 25-30 deaths reported per day quoted, also seen link used approach Worldometers update.

I mean seriously - last 2-3 weeks Swedish Health Authority's official data severely lacking, still statistically significant lag 3 even 4 weeks, shared site visualises trend, more, good track record predicting death count backlog window.

In summary, speculate last 2-3 weeks raw data, rate daily deaths occur official announcements, shown downtrend last 3 weeks, typically representing deaths 6-2 weeks ago. Actual deaths past 2-3 weeks simply yet published, hence making analysing new Worldometers' format observing trend completely misleading. Oh, trust US done LONG everyone. believe Angela Merkel implicitly said Trump-led United States could longer trusted, people alternatively calling her, Macron, Trudeau new leaders free world election.

The pandemic really cemented all. Exactly this! Every single time there's bank bailout, find fact screwed middle class poor. Every. Single. Time. pissed Cheerios morning?  talking number people kills per year would correct. However look impact society alcohol far worse. 1 million child abuse cases involve alcohol, 40% homicides involve alcohol. look impact peoples lives far greater detriment people either sugar cigarettes.

I would still encourage people wear masks eating drinking. It’s smart idea. It’s encouraging see honestly, one example stupid behavior NJ takes action. reminds NY couple weeks back Cuomo tweeting “don’t make come there...” saw similar knucklehead partying going on. haven’t seen headline mass partying NY since. 

This exactly countries handle thing well. They’re stomping sparks *immediately* turn fire, proactive instead reactive it. might popular people, especially “but damn hair cut!!!” crowd, that’s good leadership actually is. Making right decisions public outcry. 

Well done good luck NJ. There’s reason along NY, CT remain right track speaking resident myself, see similar behavior reopening restaurants act 100% hope Baker similar response stomps right fuck out. virus cannot screwed around Take upvote helping trying help too. didn’t say nothing. said Taiwan Japan did. need lock like China. worst way opinion. hurts community much. don’t think sane country follow China’s example. Where'd get kettlebells? They're sold everywhere price *can* put family, amirite? Hello, South African here! 

Our numbers initially remained low 3 months hard lockdown - grocery stores essential services allowed trade. Even outdoor exercise alcohol forbidden.

We young population, benefit, also high immunocompromised population (HIV TB). also summer - middle winter. I'm fairly certain healthcare system better treatments developed countries.

Our initial lower numbers attributed early harsh lockdown. unfortunately can't sustain level lockdown, probably start seeing higher deaths economy continues open people return urban areas work. Yea ability to. Thing kind feel though, restaurants often future anyway, weather permitting. Wondering today’s reporting delay truly delay. Nonetheless glad something. goes without saying need rollbacks AZ Ducey isn’t proactive. passing buck different group people shoulder burden. shit solution. plenty tenants abuse this. saw NY eviction moratorium. Plenty renters expiring leases income issues want deal hassle finding new places, rising costs, leases ended. lots squatters refuse leave. far biggest concern. thing takes lot people seems cause many health issues, far typical respiratory illness. continually get within short time frames (3 6 months), going really, really bad. thing realize 4 degree increase mean ""everywhere become 4 degrees hotter"". warming happen uniformly. poles, example, see much drastic increase tropics. means energy distribution across Earth's atmosphere become imbalanced (compared we're used to, anyway), resulting regional climate shifts absolutely upset human structures. include unprecedented droughts (which kill vegetation, leading dust storms. See: Dust Bowl), frequent energetic storms (including tornados, hurricanes, monsoons, blizzards, etc), altered growing seasons regions (leading food insecurity), expanded ranges pests mosquitos (which spread disease) locusts (more food insecurity). on.

These consequences mean parts world going become inhospitable human life. widespread famine, resulting migration humans affected regions unaffected regions. lead refugee crises, war.

This fiction. already happening. 2006 2011 Syria experienced severe drought history, leading widespread crop failure socioeconomic strife. People migrated rural urban regions, straining country's infrastructure. one causes Syrian Civil War, led Syrian refugee crisis, one causes behind resurgence far-right thinking across Europe elsewhere. record-breaking drought? Yes, tied anthropogenic climate change.

This story going forward. like get Memorial Day, teachers want winter break fall 50% mark school year, teachers like two weeks fall break, winter break, spring break. way meet wishes school year start early. Bars reopened totally fucked population Texas. remain closed. “acting like king,” like say. people, least rational ones, begging Abbot this, more, weeks. fact, Abbot continuously failed people Texas, done enough slow spread COVID-19. hospitals capacity people don’t access basic medical care. Here's problem logic--you assume people 60 higher chance dying anything. Unfortunately age, people become likely die, covid not. Yeah barely remember first weeks. difficult form coherent memories. Fr fun. realized much money I've wasting eating going bar weekends. Luckily I've used time learn cook dishes home, also make mixed drinks. Honestly much cheaper.

I'll probably still go bars next year things better mainly I'm single. worst, depending look it. number people. way 20 mil people live area NYC without electricity running water. aren’t friends friend. Easiest thing someone insults gives hard time keeping safe slowly go contact. 

You hit nail head last comment. shit human beings can’t understand safety mask wearing good, well bye then! Me. ): San Francisco see ugh percent people using masks. However, venture Palo Alto twice week, little mask usage.

It’s shocking many idiots put mask enter train. Sit seat, proceed take mask. riders complain, make excuses dangle mask saying it’s right here. conductor wake put mask on. take back again.

It’s frustrating don’t see people won’t wear damn thing! time I've seen 'people hallways' hospital Netherlands fire works storage -filled capacity- midst residential neighbourhood exploded. (Yeah putting bright concluded hindsight.) even hours people taken hospitals ambulances. 
 
But disaster situation. situation people seen coming months... made also *preventable* get 'people hallways' point. nooooooooooooo... Yep. sold river cheaper production. shipping money skills overseas. Totally legal many states.  prefer Oregonaynays. pity.

Always wanted try authentic Brazilian churrasco cuisine. 


But I'm US. getting explore anything else either.  [*laughs 100°F temp fromer professor mine, fond interesting page intended defend Swedish approach dealing Corona crisis criticize countries. thought important make relevant data accessible.*

 Ugh sucks. I'm sorry. hope temporary rise things get control again. I'm Western Europe people also wear masks seems though gradual reopening helped things thus far numbers rising. /knocks wood He's retired judge, unless Banethoth obviously currently sitting judge. Indeed...

We hearing lot stories healthcare workers making decisions news. come eventually story, situation gets bad enough. unfortunately definitely will...

I hope everyone take virus seriously. day giant holiday. really expecting change way people acting? 

I'd expect second coming Jesus I'd expect mandate rushed 3rd July mean anything people barbecue 4th. doubt exist, doubt anything actually come it. feel like nobody else pays attention justice system functions. Laws matter bottom 75% country, would love surprised I'm going hold breath. mean, vitamins going harm. suspect he's selling massive markup though? Yup. don’t need order president point (it’s like anyways).

If brain, need wear mask period keep track people based whether family members refused wear mask, retarded were.  even season 2. They're making Corona universe story, parallel universe.

You can't write new pandemic timeline. 

Or maybe can. Shit. ignore what's going US let kill ignorance? don’t need armed guards. say manager, “you’re asked leave property. call police remain, cited trespass. press charges. leaving dialing phone?” They're people National Guard deployed against. Healight technology delivers intermittent ultraviolet (UV) light through endotracheal catheter and according company, studied potential treatment coronavirus respiratory infections.

First developed 2016 research team Medically Associated Science Technology (MAST) Program Cedars-Sinai led Mark Pimentel, MD, Healight has shown potential effective antiviral antibacterial treatment.  Basically always goes people boost immune system protect Covid. Among things suggests taking Vitamin D.

To mind, that's Joe's way make virus less scary himself, assuring control getting not. ""Take care yourself"" bad advice, comes ugly suggestion everyone hit virus way negligent. Allright pointless. time plan B. might wanna watch front window Larry. Son happens FUCK STRANGER ASS!!! Correct. could to. 15 would go zero right? just... can’t anymore. I’m usually freedom terms media something isn’t right this. entire society fucking stupid believe shit feel it’s weapon access to. People dying. feel like shit needs blocked, least mandatory disclaimers like nicotine. Idfk. mention cases article? I’m sorry. Hang there. mom also 60s high risk. Sending good vibes friend. Boy best careful go Karen you. Reddit really something that. sub made long time COVID19 broke mods seem personal (political) agenda. Absolutely I'm confused. trump say going make testing free? HCQ wasn’t effective need stop peddling crap. 

Bogus studies? Valid studies. said HCQ nothing. stop prescribing it. 

Delete dumb comment. Maybe it’s time American Universities rethink extortionate amount money de tuition require. It’s ridiculous don’t understand it! You’re making huge leap. dozens pandemic-able viruses China appropriate agencies aware of. That’s job, identify shit get started. many unheard influenza strains ultimately never make species leap infect small amount people. isn’t news, shouldn’t scare pretending is. 

So let get straight...when agencies report dozens pandemic capable viruses I'm supposed read job know?

What fuck sort anti-intellectual bullshit this?

Just I'm reading new research viruses mean treat every news article scientific journal article reason panic. influenza pandemic 100 years ago mean I'm sitting fear happening again.

You're one making leaps here, buddy.

I'm simply defending scientific research journalists reporting said research. sort dumbass state affairs even find position.

Go huff discarded tissue itching proof disease away ignorance whatever fuck believe. Maybe Oregonese Oregonian Oreonish Jesus shit again. 

Gilead got what, 50 million money. know much drug going cost total?

A billion. That’s b. own. That’s risk companies take develop new drugs. billion per drug average cost get development market. 

Enough “but muh taxpayers” horseshit. Taxpayers, even factor indirect university involvement, don’t come anywhere near financial warchest required develop new drug Look eyes spank me. British news watching lately :( No. We've increased testing now, surges new though. simply spreading due states opening early, people wearing masks, etc.. sub? Give reason breaks heart seven times higher total infection cases country. Jesus fuck. Buy puts far can- remember 08 took 500 days bottom out. However excessive inflation (talking apocalypse bingo card stuff) Stocks rise fast real value go shit time can’t math reality. Anyways 2 cents. Gov. Newsom thought would great idea reopen state, saying back like April would ""only reopen based science politics."" 

Guess went back quick. I'm Sac County, governor said thinking reopening downhill. People stopped wearing masks, started going out, etc. doubt would set outdoors. Plenty convention centers, stadiums, schools, etc could utilized. Amazing racist people espousing racist abuse latino workers can't get tacos without face mask. 'merica. Larry says: ................... it’s brainier air-con big factor spreading virus. read study restaurant infected customer, sat air con blower. Everyone sat ‘downwind’ caught Covid. Anyone upwind fine... what? What's gonna happen people dont wear masks indoors. love idea, that's is. idea, still see 50% people wearing masks grocery stores. Increases due increased testing..we've increased testing now..we're seeing surges recently though. Wow that's insane school even session yet wtf!

This political issue. people make smart decisions countless people die.

You’re don’t right shop shopping puts others harm’s way. Tell kick rocks. still sitting 760 shares. One day King! Pennsylvania, likely due big outbreak starting nearby NY, hit harder earlier cases really spiking right start April chaos limited equipment, lack testing, etc going on.

Don’t lol Could related high level protesting around Cali? happen we'd say ""wow miracle!"" 0% chance happen regardless much want hope.. wearing mask, right? means protecting others.

http://news.mit.edu/2019/storing-vaccine-history-skin-1218 think anti-intellectualism/anti-science sentiment America stems association elitism higher learning.

While scientific progress given us great advances recent years, especially telecommunications IT, done average Joe Jane make difficult hold stable jobs work culture perpetually dynamic becoming increasingly automated. 

They say re-training education make people employable again, keep mind America - re-training education often paid out-of-pocket. fact re-train renew education transition new career every years gives impression education money sink rich elites afford.

TL;DR Science higher education great reason lost job, debt, constantly find playing catch up.  Nice job forgetting received tag dollars development too. Yeah definitely Targets fault selling mask without package. Thus guy. Lmao. Remind 2 weeks! Warm moist ambient air keeps airways mucous membranes moist helps fight viruses. wonder based on

I think smart man good jeans created this. get logic behind recommending people wear mask walking around allowing outdoor dining (&amp; presumably chatting) ... like, ""Ah yes, let's reopen one things can't mask on."" thing virus flukes outliers virus. doubt flu kills near % metabolic healthy individuals covid &amp; already know covid wipes way people metabolic syndrome vs healthy well. think Covid screams: I'm Heeeeeeeeeeeere! infects you? Nope, doesn't. infective showing symptoms. dumb. know take vaccine treatment becomes available, either. People discussing numbers scores game. Almost proud represent. said back March: would governor okay bars staying open? That's people go make less logical choices. mean enjoying rational amount alcohol bad choice, mean people drinking, loosening touch rational choices process, talking near other, making enough mistakes make completely sober... helping spread virus. Major protests riverside? No. cases traced back parties mostly. Family birthday parties killer events think effective vaccine happen anytime soon. We've flu hundred years flu vaccines 40% 60% effective (cdc numbers). similarly effective covid vaccine might best year away even would make covid half deadly.  What's actually going happen people get bored careful, react slowly waves, virus spread essential worker population, quarter million people die, vulnerable afford isolate themselves.  take year two, 10's millions people recover asymptomatic reactions they'll feel risk greatly reduced want go out.

If think young people afraid never public bathroom group strangers packed stall coke together...or watched regulars go home different partners every night. people afraid loneliness death guess I'll die crowded households - younger essential worker spread parents grandparents think people emotional fatigue  Spoiler alert: Drove Oregon today. Almost customers wearing masks gas station. Cashier covering nose (curious know much matters) Subway guy touching mask remove every time talks. Every. Time. !remindme 25 days

u/shaggymex figure? look back ""usual"" 2ish weeks lag time people toss around (lag time cases versus deaths caused cases), California reporting 3500ish range per day. 50 people died cases reported back around time, that'd roughly 1.5% mortality rate. Although mortality rate difficult nail kinds reasons, seems like consensus settled ballpark range 0.3% 1% overall mortality rate. that's actually deaths expect number cases, meaning that, unsurprisingly ask me, real number infections continues undercounted even massively increase testing. exactly Sweden turn spreading virus around? I'm curious. know  friend . get ear full this. something stupid mention it.... basically beaches North South LA county double packed. Perfect. leaders instead managers would good start.

Being provided consistent, fact based info trusted government bodies would nice well, no, short masks said work. 

Science political. significant number Americans frame science around religion. good.

This result. Yes People gotten sick yet. standard practice scientists study flu viruses circulating Asian farm animals. typically new flu strains arise adapt humans. studying data, try predict flu strains dominant next flu season, get flu vaccine companies start manufacturing accordingly. 

This new virus still pigs. 10% pig farm workers antibodies new virus. implies potential jump pig human, since workers sick, virus poorly adapted humans easily wiped immune system. situation needs monitored flu viruses mutation quickly. Whoa lol. can’t unsee American Psycho bateman ha Teach critical reading critical history schools.

I know long term, something combat idiocy (and yeah, America kinda picked right … *damn* … certainly quite total monopoly stupid minute) struggle think handle adults fully fledged egos. change come somewhere people, they're invested idiocy ego. change.

Ever. develop despite antibiotics kind swine flu resistant it. Younger people better chance many people interact with..... prepare age groups spike next week. good job young ones social conscience certainly go mass gatherings this.....oh, wait, maybe justice warrior stuff twitter Probably one evil man living today. deleted everything except Reddit bought old guitar eBay, want go Facebook WhatsApp signal I’ve left groups leaving anxious play guitar instead. Might need slow bit higher donny’s re-rlection chances /s Lol yeah, drove Irvine Newport Beach pick food shocked literally one wearing mask there. Literally, 20-30 people saw there.

In defense, least outdoors, still. McConnell Pence sure reversed opinions masks pretty fast. bad already killed 115,000 Americans. little late idiots. considerate Americans give health health children keep freedom 0.001% richest people earn money... super nice ;-P

On serious note, understand people vote like crazy politicians want universal public health care social improvements. Even left wing people go conservative options... guess movies really fooled thinking day rich work hard.. (spoiler alert: won't) live Southern Oregon ever seen confederate flag times entire life. Oregon wasnt even part Confederacy. dont know single racist person. absolutely full shit. Maybe leave shitty, overpopulated concrete jungle every see Oregon really like. “I didn’t want mask, saw concrete lion wearing one outside library thought...well he’s wearing it, to.” heat far affected pandemic? state guidelines reopening pretty good. people refusing follow (like ""wear masks near people""). local law enforcement many counties noted enforcing mask orders closure orders. buy 50 pack boxes local CVS. much supply chain issue still? People bad math usually bad science. Right...? Silver lining? I’ve looking one. point ive seriously trying push comes California. There’s doubt California good place right now; continue trend sitting nothing rising cases, we’re gonna deep shit. However, reason CA high numbers due variety competing factors. 

1.	This argument constantly vilified, it’s secret CA testing like crazy. Yesterday, record 105,000 tests performed 5% positivity rate. Compare Arizona Florida positivity rate 22%. course, it’s incredibly naive dumb think rise cases 100% attributed increase testing, it’s all. However, portion rise explained increasing testing 
2.	As pointed out, CA almost 40 million people. Given population, makes sense lot people set it. course, remained closed, number would down, looking absolute number isn’t good. need look cases per capita, California actually lies current national average (although maybe long)
3.	CA also ton young people, demographic people going out. majority people testing positive don’t need hospitalizations; battle home. Again, trying excuse what’s going on, it’s incredibly disappointing see young people partying without masks midst global pandemic. However, it’s important keep mind majority people getting Arnet immediate death sentence.

I’d also like add despite disappointment Newsom opening economy WAY soon, pleasantly surprised he’s handling recently. look Florida, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, governors states approach “eh, it’s big deal lol”. shut down, didn’t stress importance so, people went thing. Scientists continuously told they’re cases would spike, frankly didn’t give shit. Newsom, CA gov, hand taken seriously since day 1. Again, rushed opening, big reason due fact CA literally couldn’t afford remain closed longer. However, watch speak daily addresses, takes situation extreme seriousness. One thing liked actually scientific researcher answer questions talk COVID 19. I’m hoping CA gov regain control soon, seems like they’re finally starting realize they’re going go hard enforce new restrictions People shot that. uncle brazil months back. Whoever described worse flu reaaaally fucked up, csuse thing nothing like it... mayor smells money opens everything goes shit listening scientists fuck spoiled Coronavirus movie 2022. agree you. Way early certain anything. Simple logic dictates (to least) Sweden's case reduction natural, therefore sustainable Florida's, instance. time tell, course. Thank you!!!! think need specific say “The oral test 70% accurate”.

But yes, good reasons bad numbers directions. average stay ICU patient 3.4 days 

For causes yes. COVID much longer that. worry, I'm sure things much better China's control. wonder social credit score go protest. disappear goes certain threshold? America first needs control contain virus. literally chance idiot protestors beach party goers.
The way controlled 100% infection rate, seems donny wants hope, even pandemic burns nation, people still calling ""fake"", made media, apparently decided fall swords wearing masks.

So, really know ever time ""everyone"" take virus seriously.

I think biggest issue delay infection symptoms showing up, makes hard people accept real present threat.

For many idiots, someone close going catch it, get sick enough need ventilator, even then, make ""recovery"" continue play virus. guess 'Merica! people seem able separate actual news/information ""stuff"" ""garbage"" there.

Of course sure help one bit President staff keep trying play everything, rest party seems go along whatever...

Sigh... really don’t see Covid collateral damage 50 year olds whose cancer gets diagnosed 3 months later die rather survive, need extensive surgery disability result delay. 

We someone ICU right didn’t want come (empty) ED case Covid there, easily treatable problem time. Presented way late. stopped read 'trust' 'China' sentence. Damn that's terrible Why? number cases population higher lower others, countries may still catch subsequent waves. Round 2? Bro got KO’d walking cage year haha Every country issues. France, swine flu pandemic, minister health enlarged PPE stockpile, though pandemic bad anyone expected, good idea. criticized, stockpile later reduced save money. hope people responsible crucified, really expect it. understand huge deal Trump. wear make america great mask togheter baseball cap. 


THen right wing wear american, redneck flags slogans. left can't hate masks. 


But maybe i'm Belgian understand Americans.  say this? *no point theirm. Crap, better add shopping list! ""To according needs"" like real world zombie movie, instead undead, they're unsmart. European, blows mind... grapes sour ain't they? Save puppies Iran Eid?  Plus ton overweight elderly people US - even them, hospitals still going pushed past capacity. happening. Yes. know die less. news there. Nobody dressed pray Gos us, federal government certainly isn’t. too. still much don’t really know virus.

Remember early narrative *it really affects old people* likely lulled everyone complacency? remember. free people free country, need masks, protest together freedom rights wear mask.

i used dream place freedom, looks like freak circus thanks coronavirus internets. Oh yeah dude, July, fucked. Shits gonna hit fan sure. Retired judge, certified POS. Wiki:

""Napolitano made numerous claims the Civil War, rejected historians. claims include Civil War President Abraham Lincoln's war choice, slavery dying anyway, Lincoln could freed slaves paying slaveholders, Lincoln armed slaves."" Yep, good reason colder winter months invest humidifier. Exactly lol. “Oh circumvent license seen camera” Let bring light everyone gets see. Please tell hotspots there’s current ban?

The answer is: None them. 

Yes there’s obviously crowds nothing like back may. haven’t made new bans since far I’ve seen. 

Please share information says otherwise. 

Do realize Denmark pretty much back normal? daily deaths anymore. test 20.000 people day find less 50 new cases. Tivoli open. Residents care homes visitors next week. BLM protest 15.000 people didn’t get banned also didn’t start new outbreak. outbreak northern Jutland discovered contained overloaded local hospitals. Residents Denmark travel Europe don’t pose risk. 

Meanwhile Sweden there’s still 30-40 deaths per day. There’s 35 times people hospitalized Denmark. regions yet managed get efficient test system running. 

And still many others convinced it’s neighbor countries don’t sustainable solution. Absurd. Water parks open? Dang nabbit Arizona. Bih brain time! conclusion make right now. First, Sweden still (small) regulations/recommendations, second, know nothing potential second wave Sweden yet, first one yet done. look US' upswing. course hope right. Halloween must suck. ""I wear mask reason wear underwear. Things gotta breathe!""

*Idiot, 3 days ago* see made safe long pandemic continues. looked state (Michigan), honestly, see anything suggest correct. actually predicted famous book called Rise Decline Nations, [Mancur argues (with enough proof accepted economic theory, large) special-interest groups always eventually take bog nation down, slides obscurity.

We're doomed. Fresh deaths. Look moneybagins here! Sweden many times people needing life long medical care countries won't. anyone looked spikes Covid spikes correspond cities protests cities opened bars? don’t remember hearing big protests AZ, TX, FL, yet hot beds right now. 

I don’t know answer this, statistics correlate virus spikes protest areas areas open bars, think, would help solve debate (and name calling blaming). go look shit up. mean obviously BLM protests REAL problem here... playing deaths current strategy. It’s “yeah cases high deaths way low, don’t worry reopen” ain't kidding. butthole still PTSD It. Ugh bad. call work either. worked 3 weeks tournament over, went straight hospital. Nobody cares opinion either hey, are. positive way thinking it, thank you! ""open"" windows speak? live Houston exception private homes rare public building 80 years ago more, windows open. 

I know author article got information, good pointing impracticality. Nice   Jilin outbreak put down. period 2 days entirety China classified low risk, Beijing outbreak. Jilin last districts holding ""all low risk"" thing. remember correctly time Jilin therefore rest China classified low risk, Jilin 8 cases left hospital new confirmed cases 2 weeks.

The protocol new outbreak really changed, always been:

1. Contact trace index case(s), isolate close contacts

2. Deploy large scale testing medium high risk areas

3. Put medium high risk areas wartime closed management

And looks like virus still outrunning containment effort:

4. City-wide lockdown

Chinese CDC several road portable biosafety level 3 labs move around country hotspots. PCR testing COVID-19 sample requires biosafety level 2 labs quite common, samples must inactivated first. Fresh samples yet inactivated must handled biosafety level 3 labs. Hence little road portable labs dedicated handling live samples inactivate distribute various BL2 labs run actual analyses.

As someone cashiered WIC used WIC kids born: WIC one best programs have. keeps children pregnant women _healthy_. gets checking social medical professionals regularly. terms low-income people relying subsidized healthcare, WIC program prevents malnourished infants young children, probably pays long run. 

I'd love see WIC SNAP expanded prepared/hot foods healthy, stupid restriction serves purpose punishing people needing food assistance. Especially because, again, companies racing offer healthy food options would undoubtedly bleed healthy food diets average Americans. Happy hear restaurants cafes live reopened people crowding like crazy. last Thursday restaurant bar. bar serving food plexiglass dividers placed every two bar stools, 11 PM whole place packed like nightclub 300 people crowding bar music blasting. think we're going see huge spike ten days. thought experiment, consider [this post 

~30% Cell immunity study plus ~25% confirmed anitbody tests plus percent current active cases = herd immunity NYC. Obviously isn’t proven fact yet, lots data suggests far, far less 100% population susceptible getting covid first place. study related ones truth all, totally feasible harder-hit places approaching level immunity would result drop cases, regardless outstanding mask/shelter place policies Black Death also 50-90% fatality rate, spread animals. lot reasons Black Death disaster don’t apply Coronavirus. Guess turns young people, “are significantly less affected virus”, everything’s shut absolutely nothing risk exposure infection. virus actually lower risk. 


Turns also wasn’t exactly accurate. We’ve collectively great job completely fucking everything since March. actually work. could actually interface brain using microchips would many cool scary things could do.

Funny million people able keep working without pause many let go rehired far sooner. 

Also many industry 1099 small businesses able collect UI. extra 600 nice eligible. many home months many months go little income. 

But guess guy right, could pave roads something right? 

Sorry missing concert though. fact less. mask mandate bonafide public health benefit. Requiring wear pants hanging front lawn serves make people _feel_ better look pee-pee. like kids actually wear masks anyways. adults aren't. kids much naturally rebellious begin with. retarded would open schools without trying mandate masks, it. They'll learn schools pandemic work, one way another unfortunately guess told don’t room ICU. thats fine

doesnt matter anyway

we got new chinese swine flu coming! 

drink up! They’ve done themselves. Even was, matter week two spread demographic groups. bar owner right it’s ethical obligation take L permanently close takes shut point.


None bars matter enough allowed kill patrons. probably virus control. not. Apparently, running low tests Texas. Also, heard contact tracing working. People cooperate. ""*current social distancing, mask wearing, less people traveling*"" Must live US, bc literally looked like nation wide spring break vacay weekend.
 
 
Edit: least am. Sooo awesome love cow jumps moon. hear many stories like especially every one case like 99 cases nothing bad happened.  disproportional 'reporting' causing people estimate true risk themselves. ICU cases American living New York statement true. 

People country think shit doesn’t stink. People don’t care one another slightest. 99.9% citizens lack mentality keep virus bay. Wearing mask become political freedom so. 

Just straight ignorance...

I’m embarrassed live place. 

Godspeed America, Godspeed used way Michigan, plenty homes due humidity absolutely brutal summer. Yeah, kids foster care still haven’t gotten visits 3 months. state starting visits kids 6 months under. It’s sad there’s safe solution right without putting workers, kids, foster parents, etc risk Yeah, we’re not. Especially us chose college route get reality check “loan provider” emails ICU patients then? like put option buy cities soon overwhelmed covid19 cases? 🤔 seems like it’s mostly younger people catching days, they’re less likely hospitalized die. It’s still good, they’re eventually going spread vulnerable people, that’s likely explanation CFR dropping like stone.

We've 6k deaths, cases, deaths etc declining since initial march outbreak.

Its likely virus ran course nobody even follows social distancing.

Bars, movie theaters etc also reopened since june 1st single spike.  retarded. beyond help... need full two weeks recovery minimum. Tell employer go fuck themselves, COVID. get bitchy, call local news media, call state's health department complain. Really I've thought first contact thing unite us. Sadly turn ""us vs them"" mentality new target together. happens millions protest pandemic... How’s great time start vaccine Right. everywhere ain't much ""You people fend die. I'ma call buddy Vlad."" convenient Public indoor spaces. Stores, etc. Pennsylvania's governor put effect early April. realize states same. Israel big outbreak. think it’s younger folks getting sick *and* we’ve gotten better treating severe cases. doesn’t seem death counts gone much. sure, haven’t done deep dive. However, case numbers keep climbing. we're protecting better cases going up? death rate definitely low number new cases America sent shockers among people. Probably first wave never ended.

I truly don’t understand “I won’t wear mask” group. imagine theyre self aware shit coming mouths don’t want trapped next face. critical either actually. making point. guess bugs see single article anywhere trying blame protesters covid cases. try blame anyone everyone else though. one Denver Convention Center. Never even came close using it. better safe sorry. R naught


Is it’s spelled? always thought ‘knot’.

I’ve saying R zero regardless, I’d heard ‘naught’ enough know it’s British term thing, I’d assumed regional difference would translate.  Yeah tried hide reports January/February, work them. would think suddenly hide now? Yeah mean substances. smoke weed everyday. I’m bartender it’s making hate alcohol. It’s destructive drug. Hobbies really helped stay bottle find real friends things me. Bartending also gives lot social interaction I’m weird example. last lockdown really helped find new hobbies shit also. also live ski town there’s tons like minded people live reasons. like...a year ago, would said ‘coronaviruses weak shit compared swine flus’...it’s strain. said, don’t think something concerned right now. BBQ place near letting people dine months closed. looked like removed every table enforce social distancing, however along service area booths, can't moved.

When pick take-out order someone obviously dining sat booth RIGHT next people waiting pick orders. least one person saw sense sit far away near windows. found willing journalists push forward? hate political everything surrounding virus become virus doesn’t you’re are... Hahah 😂 Tomorrow's headline - ""People losing immunity coronavirus faster thought"". Mass gatherings aren’t required spread it, creates super spreading events. far statistical risk likely catch people around. 

If entire state bars, restaurants, factories/processing plants, offices churches open little precautions makes sense you’d see thousands cases. fairness bar owners getting money government close. cant take away guys paycheck expect smiling it. reopening there’s vaccine.

You're meme account, right? reading comprehension awful means point I'm saying incorrect. I'll wait. so, flu, plus covid plus swine flu? 

Where sign pink slips? think im done happens allow idiots sue make money. glorifies stupidity ignorance devalues society. pandering lowest common denominator. Sadly, human nature. Women childbearing age much likely rescued dangerous situations strangers others well. lizard brains. Fuck Fuck off, Mike. Says guy blindly trusting country keeping entire population propaganda internet firewall, besides many others. months hiding supports regime, rather threatening it. believe it’s better strategy squash virus borders parts country still producing things. essentially locking 1/10th state there’s flare up, contain still allow rest state states continue normal possible. Sounds like man science.  news Remdesivir expensive concerning. 

What I'm concerned with, however, small effect size. [According difference recovery time 11 days compared 15, reduction mortality rate 4%. seem like whole heck lot touted ""cure"". Somebody make sure president knows. Think message went junk mail last time weird though mostly happened southern latitudes though. guess protests happened Sun/Bible belt. 

/s people protesting masks definitely cucked riot. That's even worse. again, that's one uses ""service"". Tell Gwenneth Paltrow shake hands chef.   listen 101.5 then! morning Bill Spadea praising bar spewing types anti science rhetoric, basically repeating trump's talking points, callers agreed except dude sean, Bill called us ""crazies living fear"". 1015 NJ public radio facebook group, bunch idiots wanna rush limbaugh Ok, shut long?

And intend keep people fed housed? 

Considering virus zero intention going away returning, remain entirely locked vaccine? 

Shut airports? 

Let’s hear grand plan oh brilliant one. didn’t ask two major spreader events. take precautions businesses operate profits without overcrowded, well social distancing.

Nothing like restaurants, bars, clubs social distancing, mask use, additional PPE use almost nonexistent Reopening bars bad idea general. can't expect people drinking give shit. guess confused. Thought Sunday monday reports lower lag weekend spikes back tuesday. reminds masks work campaign January February. believe that, going either. total BS! think freely like piss true, people China know details every single case tested positive. called competent contact tracing. anywhere remotely close positive case know it. know fuck China assume everyone else ignorant what's happening there. take: schools must reopen can't rely parents take care children. completely shit reason risk amplifying virus. showing 110 positive cases 18 deaths NJ today so... regular face mask loose, worn correctly not. talking N95, fine fact matter people wearing plain face masks. block ""substantial"" amount gaps way less resistance. still sucking plenty unfiltered air, smaller gaps. (Put thumb garden hose water comes faster. compare without thumb bucket, amount time, amount water fill bucket) Anything short sealed still high risk.

Again, point wearing mask all, still risky sweaty gym full people breathing without masks. stupid could be? King douches, leading douche parade...
if ever time wouldn’t mind tear gas used protester, would here.  Wait. state parks bars? Ive trying rally service industry peeps people think I’m crazy. live San Bernardino county. available tests San Bernardino county July 6th. checking cities border us LA county boom. thing. restaurants going rogue (like buffets opening aren’t supposed to) hiding cases employees. doesn’t matter get tested anyways? numbers going artificially low nobody get tested. means stay open 4th July get absolute wrecked there’s testing logjam action take going delayed. It’s insane. don’t know anyone else doesn’t see problem lmao

Edit: spelling I’m certainly saying wearing mask protection need, ideally others wearing to. mask definitely protecting even others aren’t wearing masks. careful making perfect enemy good.  problem isn’t healthcare states, actually *do* best doctors world. Maybe I’m speaking luxury hospitals rated tops world. 

Our healthcare *system* though? Absolutely joke, far away bottom barrel outright worst planet. fact people get porked hard healthcare costs literally choose doctor hospital visits vs financial toll outrageous, add global pandemic top that. wouldn’t surprised that’s big reason part spread here, people feel symptoms think “naw fuck it, COVID would never happen can’t afford test/Dr Visit anyway” ignore go right back infect people. don’t screw around COVID, I’d lying said past didn’t skip doctors appts even wasn’t feeling great another huge bill I’m already stretched financially thin. 

No developed nation, screw that, NATION PERIOD make choices live like regular life states way many us. absolutely terrifying - thing I've worrying since began. Meanwhile, everyone spreading myth 'children affected'. Sure, man. affected who? KNOW! People need stop making decisions opening schools play spaces water parks presumptions, hopes, prayers. WORKING! outliers? ~~400,000+~~ 500,000+ people died despite entire world shutting attempt control it? many would died things weren’t shut down? many would die unnecessarily could get fast food beer way? Shame selfish. UBI government stimulus answer. reopening there’s vaccine.

Edit: Oh yay. passed half million deaths worldwide today. yeah... let’s reopen. need hide cases outside world, look stronk like Winnie, know, like tried whole virus thing. correct explanation. OK, would people Fauci Trump massive commercial blitz encourage mask use? ""nail coffin pandemic"" opening.

NY's numbers good since mask usage started.

Most people wait much longer without signs progress say ""fuck it."" That's right, exploiting vulnerable personal profit, despicable. see riots, marches protests covid bad again.

Dont ever change reddit Tbh, 15 minutes driving around trying figure pickup area 15 minutes calling number multiple times picked waiting bring items car. bars restaurants malls. womens clothing stores. course, people still go there.  (Maybe reddit nerds, real people do. ;-) Excuse WHAT? yep live canada. economy really closely tied usa. guys go fucked Connecticut really well. Oh man would give left nut province Canada right now. part guys handling still well. 

That’s interesting testing. Yeah shit starts opening back up, testing contact tracing important. Like need serious it. opened stuff AZ contact tracing basically non existent. Yeah Californian, cool guys. everybody lives apartment would homeless? even everybody wants own. people can't.  

Yes questionable ethics, call renting bad? Sounds nice, keep masks possible stay outside everyone fine! like little tip prescribed antidepressants -specifically ones notoriously hell come like effexor - doctor prescribing shit like pandemic? Make sure homework commit, last thing want experience covid, PLUS fucking withdrawals. going withdrawals trick thinking got covid..........And kind shit pawned you? might wanna find new doctor.....

Just PSA downplay serious California, California population almost 40 million. Compare to:

* Arizona: 7.3 million
* Texas: 29 million
* Florida: 21.5 million

Florida reporting 9,000 new cases day equivalent 18,000 new cases California. look daily new cases California compare states. California always steadily increasing new cases. Compare 7 day moving average California today vs (let's say) May 29th. see 5,556 vs 2,308, increase 140%. states, is:

* Arizona: 680%
* Florida: 810%
* Texas: 430%

I live California think state opening far quickly. think 8000 new cases way many. think numbers shot nowhere, they've steadily climbing since March. think there's attention Arizona/Florida/Texas even though California relatively larger numbers dramatically sharp change shape curve.  BN🙌🙌🙌 No. worse, think could interfere breathing. They’ve already failed! Kids parks hanging groups roaming around together. idea kids going social distance failed. Might well put N95 teacher hope best!  India really low number tests compared positive ratio. testing enough going get worse. get one per week? get one, period! breaks becomes visibly soiled, request new one. I’m bedside RN Arizona Everyone needs second jobs, stop shaming.  tried screaming, pointing shouting ""UNCLEAN! UNCLEAN!"" highly recommend :) floated (southern CA)... understand hybrid model safer... incubation period long enough three days week means nothing. worse... days kids going way group activities fill time, thus increasing exposure odds. Probably older person... seem prone it.. think bad take. People close quarters, indoors, help,spread virus. it’s hot outside, people go air conditioned restaurants bars. it’s cold outside, people go inside get warm.


But I’d surprised virus “recirculated” AC large indoor malls problematic. 

People analyze space air flow - convinced height ceiling would number one factor. space fair amount people 8 fat ceilings - bueno. Twenty foot ceilings proper spacing - much better.  Zuma Beach today. pretty empty. Lots space everybody social distancing way way apart. thing many people wearing masks (we were). Sheriffs ATVs enforcing either. understand July 4th weekend different situation. CDC make statement effect people shouldn’t wear masks beginning. huge fuck part.

The reality wanted save masks emergency personnel. that’s conveyed it. Also, tf cares stigma wearing one? Feels like middle school didn’t wear brand name clothes, weren’t popular.  really wish “we finding cases” “everyone catching this.”

Watching hospital capacity change tell us whether cases seeing cases. think it’s former, tons small indoor gatherings people’s houses without masks distancing. indoor environment engineered space. make air clean want. real limit much want spend equipment operation. 

The typical commercial/retail indoor environment, today, filthy.  changed. improvements inexpensive, provide large benefit.  Changing filters HVAC, one those. Companies need let employees start telling customer, mask? problem, go fuck drink somewhere else. think agree. can't believe happening. Slippery slope friend. decide gets insurance action. 90% Americans denied based smoking obesity guess donating millions people expertise funding continue research enough me. actually worked large facility system like that, yeah several people entire building dealt ventilation systems, airlocks etc. I’ll die another day Stupid. wait vaccine, like children must get vaccinated via school nurses whatever start school middle school. realize health safety students, parents, staff, less important ""education."" Replace confederate statues lions wearing things. It’s true!

Keeping schools closed going catastrophic.

Opening schools likely going catastrophic.

Any strategy kids wearing masks, social distancing, staying “pods” going fail second day, anyone proposing clearly taught classroom full students. 

It’s true! it! recommended instead this?

Edit: Oh noticed restaurants listed closed. heck? definitely closed hospitalizations go nuts. much blame becoming global pandemic. watched press conferences gave first started. could declared pandemic right bat. dragged feet hemmed hawed. “No it’s big deal. won’t serious.” stating obvious?! spent lot money funding researches, help eradicate covid. understand asking about? handling properly, second wave. countries reduced number cases zero. one badly United States. approach taken literally country better. could go disprove everything said lets start there. need new Uncle Sam “I want you!” Campaign it’s “I want you, wear mask” I’d really curious read paper got information from. I’m wondering exactly testing protocols were. THING SHITTY FILTERS.

This simply true. filter longer filters air effectively (e.g. extreme example gave board) means clogged/blocked dirt old particles thus majority air breathing coming going edges mask, thus providing filter all. Even can't feel air going in/out sides, still may mask secure air flow crossing many sections edge mask.

Yes, filter better filter, true thing shitty filter. vocal anti vaxxer brother heard say things made us question beliefs (can't remember what). kids though. conscience\*

* Wash hands handling mask
* touch mask hands unless putting removing it
* Keep nose &amp; mouth matter (even talking)
* eat drink situation need mask
* Wash, dispose of, quarantine three days mask done wearing 
* Keep mask talking, coughing, sneezing. remove done wearing born bar AMA Really cool clean long, awesome job. fine, got this. stupid financial standpoint, think it. would funny wasn’t sad two restaurants I've similar system. reservation, wait outside hostess comes gets you, isolated booths limited interaction waitstaff.

I'd bet something protests. can't helped matters. saying protests necessary, saying large groups people gathering pandemic almost definitely increases number infections. lab mice long telomeres? 23% increase significant, math challenged. Ok stand corrected sorry Michael Scott. think goes back Trump, unfortunately. want admit problem, deny anymore, wanted downplay it. without board, mask wearing public efforts slow spread quickly became partisan issues. I'm glad Johnson UK.  ""run course"" mean humans achieving herd immunity? 
        
      
       Governments protective get voted out. No. We've made far deadly epidemics far, far less medical scientific advances. can't tell eventually end. far hospitality industry fully recover people feel safe economy recovers people going stop enjoying eating restaurants, traveling, etc back. Well title says going die travel home. Thats good news. Hey Europe heard jesus dude yet? Americans think made religion...  linked one. appreciate thought, I'm healthcare worker. Maybe healthcare workers thread speak question?  America‘a new strategy summarized “screw it, we’re going high score”. im definitely knowledgable guy still take Fauci's word him. Also reason development vaccines take long typically companies go next step without finishing step prior it. The'yre sacrificing safety they're cutting manufacturing time spending money. take news ""Americans, gonna prepare inevitable tidal wave hospitalizations. worry, enough yours."" :) 98/100,000 cumulative date, projected need going forward.

“The overall cumulative COVID-19 associated hospitalization rate 98.4 per 100,000, highest rates people 65 years age older (297.6 per 100,000) followed people 50-64 years (148.6 per 100,000). Hospitalization rates cumulative increase COVID-19 pandemic continues”

-your link

10% FL stands literal instant even though half cases new resolved. I’d love hear Fauci would say wasn’t US govm’t employee. I'm watch numbers daily. I'm skeptical really zero. 3 day average going today time best - 16 per day. 2/3 deaths arising cases acquired nursing homes. surprised start seeing single digit daily deaths coming days based trends relatively low rate new infections (125/day so, 1.9% people tested coming back positive), would really surprise single person died today based data leading today. sorta like idea calling “Bro Flu”. Please read let know choices stay home equation? could really use advice I’m seeing need yearly check ups heart transplant keep healthy(yearly tests, including pulmonary stress test, cardiac cath). need blood work every month. make enough money groceries delivered, entertainment paid for, can’t avoid going see doctor. can’t avoid face face nurse drawing blood. can’t breath machine might coronavirus I’m pulmonary stress test. can’t tell dr put cardiac cath jugular vein cause that’s close face makes uncomfortable close face breath 30 minutes measures pressures inside heart. killing people want go vacation better?

Seems fair levy destruction fools seek lay us. Fuck *exactly* happen. People accept virus risk move on. think red-neck pro-Trump anti-mask crowd much larger elite financially-savvy anti-mask crowd. heard knock go ventilator Yup. made clear governor serious make wearing masks public properly mandatory. many people put mask nose mouth supposed.

I would go make masks one way valves filter exhaust air sufficient; but, can't get first base yet. :(

It's going take long time get end this.

Consider: four months since crisis hit still sufficient PPE, disinfectant, tests, etc. EVERYWHERE. long take get vaccines produced distributed they've approved? disease attacking lungs. 

It attacks pancreas, kidneys, circulatory system, liver, heart, brain, lungs. 

People dying cannot breathe. People also dying clots, organ failure result. 
Just people asymptomatic show symptoms currently mean suffer organ failure later due COVID.


You know chicken pox seems harmless long term effects adult contracting chicken pox childhood devastating. Shingles main result childhood CP. virus re-emurges adult hood. coincidentally, also something scientists fear COVID. EX-FUCKING-ZACTLY sad horrible

Is though? people proud ignorance. say, deserve horribleness that's coming. well im nurse ive working covid person investigation unit new york city... gonna flying home 3 full american airline flights. lets this! No.

We flu vaccine 

We MERS vaccine *candidate* modified.

A vaccine vaccine candidate extremely different.

And flu vaccine decades old. decades worth testing base vaccine specific tweaks made seasonal vaccine.

And, despite stability, knowledge, testing... vaccine still absolutely fatal small handful patients. receive vaccine.

The hope enough people vaccinated, cannot low risk contracting flu. That's never case always hope. Yeah, beach? Social distancing 99.9% effective tool have. Beaches packed. Spread out. Go hike. Use neighborhood park. Walk around neighborhood. many options - problem everyone wants choose one. hijack thread, somebody knows they're talking explain death rate (not sure correct term) continued steadily decline despite whatever case load happened be? entirely due lag new cases, factors play? Better treatment/those risk died fastest/states cooking books? anyone links discuss detail I'd interested read it. think lot denial. many us minor cold? It’s easier people brush cold, allergies, rather face fact they’ve potentially contracted disease news. think lot people truly refuse believe can’t happen them; maybe it’s way function day day.

I don’t necessarily believe it’s right, lot people like family. Even gently mentioning virus makes upset. think it’s defense mechanism. go vegan already.

Risk pandemics cut 90% more.  totally disagree. lie provides ammunition. that. models wrong, dire predictions never coming true, one form protesting lead spike ok, elections Wisconsin cause spike (100 new cases due it), using numbers scariest way possible. instance houston icu beds 95% capicity. People see rightly get worried. time last year 93%. also include surge capicity fact head physicians hospitals saying fine.

But yes wish people wore masks. heat? I'm talking unbearable outside tells AMA needs defunded everyone refuse pay dues.  'p' word - wonder changed mods allow articles showing talking link protests spread. 50% like flipping coin. 50% people refusing get vacinee Same.

I'm really concerned this, too. think inevitable. course not, people countries correct time time maybe, *maybe* consider possibility wrong, ""defense force"". getting downvoted whistleblower revealing truth, getting downvoted spreading lies refuse change stance matter presented clear evidence. 

And I've said before, move xenophobic territory like that, ""so Swedish"" lmao. Get here... TBF lots pastors megachurches resisting lockdowns, remember?  I'm going I've done entire pandemic. Read goddamn science myself, world. seems US agencies sadly cannot trusted. examine countries managed pandemic well, strategies, modify existence fit best can.

Edit: phrasing Unfortunately would admit virus hoax actually threat, seems like something charge want admit Cotton masks anything biggest issue. pores fabric large almost absent can't filter C19's 0.3 micron particle size. makes people feel better stuff, wearing face visor far better. catches droplets traveling either way covers three mucous membranes face. Outdoor events don’t mean COVID transmission can’t happen there, chances lower would person inside. Italy’s cases traced back soccer game, remember? 

There thousands protests across world. It’s wrong assume everyone wore mask people pictures saw did. I’ve seen pictures plenty people without masks, seen also real life. takes one person without mask spread it, it. seeing many people, pictures real life, making efforts stay 6 feet apart protests. 

Because protests happened soon reopening started, don’t think we’ll ever know sure much cases exacerbated reopening vs protests. I’ve seeing “hundreds people shoulder shoulder protesting outside can’t lead COVID it’s outdoors!” narrative spread around Reddit recently, feel like people site inclined believe simply protests cause us agree with, opposed something like lockdown protests. think it’s important step back also recognize bias don’t fall trap denying downplaying facts like certain politicians don’t like answers. Good one people ""can't control it"" try putting cheeseburgers walk around block? 

I 300lbs whole pandemic started, I've lost 60lbs walking everyday eating garbage. zero sympathy fat people, something it. Nah :( kinda gave last couple months. It’s mostly Netflix, YouTube &amp; takeout. Thank thoughtful consideration! You’re welcome back anytime! like people like you. :) ok, give 50% placebo 100% success national mask mandate coming Jan earliest maybe then. That's reality things. people can’t bothered wearing mask it’s hot whatever lame excuse think of. Bottom line masks save lives. Wear one. OK Karen.

Username checks out. Irrelevant *what* known March April?

Nobody - date - proven existence SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

So, argue like much know RNA testing - one fundamental thing lies behind even know fuck testing for. Therefore, testing meaningless. White House singlehandedly going responsible lot deaths.

If could prevent somehow... Yes right! look big picture posting, wish u.s. would allow lobbyists. one small factor health care crisis - feel crisis say 50 years.... Given enough time resources, anything achievable human race I'm TN got tested couple weeks ago took 6 days get results. Ah got it! Ok, well guess it’s around 8,000 😬😬 I’m waiting see data CA gov page see many tests performed Yeah forgot mention EU citizens US, obviously would able return home country.
I thinking US citizens post. 2020 roll. First came wild fires Australia series earthquakes virus half way 2020. Maybe nature trying tell us something. hope could go second half 2020 without major hurricane typhoon. House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, “We’re place handle cases we’re seeing.”

America got deserved. elected wretch, got wretched government. paying price corpses, third country still care. Seems like lesson short-lived

 sister works sun city center. said place business gets many complaints corporate people mad wear mask crazy. heard better since mandate though. I'll ask her. 

I'm certainly glad hear attitude rampant whole. former neighbors worry about. 90s.

Edit: said there's little difference. diSsAgrEe pErSonAl FreEdoM iNteNeT ToLd tell people stock market fall again. Sell like daytrader. Nope going US won. would expected news Riverside, Texas, Riverside, California. They'll scream nobody warned CDC admitted yesterday statistics messed count. believe anyways. throw away finish procedures. Totally agree helps. I'm sure exposure definition is, that's three co-workers. rate false negatives testing, always looks ridiculous people quarantine, workplace business usual.

It's sensible people country quarantine get here. can't sure person infected, anyone else workplace. ""exposure definition"" sounds like great way skirt issue goes down.

Quarantine everyone involved test safe, heck even doing? like *didn't vote*

**VOTE NOVEMBER! FACT, VOTE TIME!**

VOTE want die hands nazis. wearing mask first started coworker said cant wear mask makes claustrophobic. responded with, ""If think makes claustrophobic try ventilator"". say much that.  Seems poorly crafted. That's game plan right now, I'm wondering end-game. Eventually they'll open borders might happen vaccine treatment created. There's also possibility vaccine work. fence small wealthy country, long for? end date. Found corporate guy clients. Incoming: Panic new “China virus” deflect current crisis. ratio total infections tested cases probably less 10x point due increased testing. Seriously I’d rather see everyone MAGA masks mask all. don’t want see people dying losing livelihood economy tanked. live south Collier. one seems give damn here.

At point it’ll take half community dying even think something wrong. weird virus. disease communicable producing symptoms? Didnt know site, thanks posting! Way many people actually know ""welfare state"" really is. Hell even know looking up. welfare differentiates America first world countries. 

If US actually promoted equal opportunity everyone (i.e: great education everyone), social safety nets citizens guarantee would improve lives almost every single American. Play dumb games, win dumb prizes. normal people want open economy, want open country families starve get penalized gets celebrated. Oh irony... Even places open idiots public.

So people subscribe worldview idiots?

My wife went margaritas night. Everyone socially distanced bar's patio, servers staff wearing masks, everything sanitized front eyes.

If think situation unsafe one who's idiot.

Have actually anywhere reopened seen like, watching videos reading stories fit narrative? winter so, bad. Everyone inside. works. Watch business pick people think picked exercising god give rights. We're introducing new shirt mandate atmosphere shirts become polarizing. Nothing outside locking indoors interacting one 100% safe. realistic path forward involves keeping everything closed vaccine. don’t think unreasonable eat restaurant long taking appropriate safety measures. changed position early April. That's bit month ago :-) 

And yes, expect that, pandemic appeared public radar late December 2019 one get used idea new results altering recomondations based said data.

We know much knew six months ago. Obviously advice change.

I Germany. government counter part CDC changed recommending masks making maditory every shop every public transport. people following along. main difference thst issue politicised here. Period. (Michigan) extended family (20 max) still want yearly cottage get together two told dad don’t think it’s safe also want thought we’d inside obviously lot well sleeping big concern (my extended family members think it’s hoax) that’s also something consider. Thoughts? want see family everyone I’m thinking it’s stupid.

This known ""super spreader"" event. One two asymptomatic people covid spread 90% people there. Good luck. concerning! Glad hear people staying more.  saying expect servers live wage can't afford live own? like optimism 50%, that's pretty low bar. ""WhAt KnOw"" - 50% country. total getting Yes. think vast majority new cases I'd consider reckless. Like said, also front line workers getting infected, course EVERYONE. I'm condemning anybody death, I'm saying that's result sometimes. see anybody could crossfire they're home distancing wearing proper PPE. case front line workers, wearing PPE can't distance, odds increase. somebody going grocery store every 2 weeks stays 6 10 feet away everybody wears proper PPE, get infected.

It's trumps fault, agree. even mixed signals, straight big problem. fault reopened way soon also. Anybody listening administration medical advice point deserves get it. fair, bar Harpers known place people make good decisions. sad part owners lot prevent taken even strict measures now, people go Harpers smart. still think MI better almost every state people follow guidelines got virus controllable level, PEOPLE FOLLOW PRECAUTIONS. problem whole thing politicized. one thing think maybe countermeasures overblown, people straight care think fake politics. fucking stupid. said I'm happy live state leadership took seriously overcautious rather oblivious. still think we're better most, hope Whitmer right thing shit starts get hand again. mean masters make national average, housing costs rising quickly (most relevant me) medical costs high unpredictable, able put enough away responsibly children. Anyone medical background care explain why? 

It seems like vaccine proven safe would good (if temporarily) even wasn’t effective. Anything mitigate spread little speaking blood sucking exec wishes beds take covid patients dispense $74 Tylenol to.  Especially people mental issues it’s always good outlet me. stay sanitary mask it’s hard quit let alone stop long time. anyone confirmed second wave? set, it’s still initial outbreak still spreading temporary slowing necessarily, likely sprang quicker action got hospital things like ban public gatherings. watched dad die ventilator two weeks January. horrible. 

If wear mask.... FUCK YOU. Induced comas notorious ridiculous nightmares entire period patient under. lot people brought need PTSD counseling years afterward. going fail reasons Trump’s attempt keep virus US blocking travel China Europe did. wasn’t enough enforcement (in case letting US citizens one monitoring quarantining) restrictions imposed late places. It’s good news know early. learn mistakes keep control time. Oh wait... even education. parents barely high school education they've masked since advised simply know follow advice medical community.

This goes back feeling entitled act like assholes ""freedom"" Tell /r/politics. even chance. Lmfao. key fuck lady acting like infection total mystery photo shoots.

It’s likely got infected first week March started show symptoms 21st. important point following guidelines outside staying 6 feet away. 

People need realize guidelines aren’t foolproof. They’re reducing spread much possible. still get infected even you’re following perfectly. believe it! live there, useful insight lol sunlight window reduce effectiveness? Haha I'll say thing miss dining bottomless soups could get free drink refills country outbreak economic impact? comparison Finland Sweden. small countries economically dead Sweden. country near done virus. No, course not. article's headline obviously meant taken literally. watched dad mom die. That's dumbest thing I've heard week. Congratulations. vacation reason people travel French fries go bad like 20 seconds order fair number people red county ""don't believe stuff"" (ugh), shrug tell quote. really comeback that. (FL) clients friends planning road trips. invited BBQ weekend inflatable slip slide. One employees can’t stop going eat indoors restaurants. said son Navy told (other side) would stop talking virus election.

We’re beyond fucked. nah that’s quote ‘alright’ kendrick lamar something I’ve wondered well. feel like could change sentiment people situation. Hospitalizations doubled ten days 6000+ Question. love barroom culture. Chatting bartender. Chatting strangers. Hanging friends. said, bar since shelter place started. go 2021. One thing I've learned 30 years drinking; drunks suck boundaries!

What's theory otherwise relatively smart folks going bars now? loneliness? Drinking problems? get it! miss going bar. I'm fight impulse. Outside nursing home &amp; meat packing facility, can't think another place dangerous contracting virus. tool tweet links horrible mobile. common term I've ever hear restaurant staff say it.

Contrast: FoH , Front House, servers bartenders. Omg big fan that. yes, how’d guess? Hehe. Thank that! Bad shit Get tested. it? weighing that, I'm even considering professional grooming again. I've able keep bathing clipping. look good hard chore. last time, nails bled. Really want keep grooming.

Thanks perspective. 

Was ready go back, I'm Texas cases skyrocketing. Yeah husband’s company already laid 50 people. husband also take 50% pay cut per month, luckily collect unemployment weeks. Lots totally COVID unrelated pneumonia though. I've done sick past, even now. Missing days school brutal, especially since always emphasize 'it's responsibility catch up' they're going compromise anything missed help catch without fault; nevermind situation actually stable home return day. Given that, hell go school, unless I'm literally bedridden? Remember March revealed Trump asked Fauci would happen let wash US? 

Well... saying wrong, know sit-in dining locations. guess assumed indoor dining causing issue. fucking late now. info needed known January. But, like now, idiots would ""half-ass it"" would end find now. Unless ANOTHER world wide pandemic living memory, lessons learned forgotten. That's pandemics get deadly. Nobody around alive remembers last deadly pandemic. would different story lots people could remember really BAD pandemic like 1918 flu like. Alas, lost old age one left remeber hell Earth REALLY like. Fuck. would like charge planning right now. friend tell way I'd know going life invited things facebook. response want take bit time talk/txt, we're apparently really friends. necessarily, one guy standing around politicizing health safety standards. Ahh thank polite reply! herd immunity number substantially higher thought be. One dumb question - fact kids really catch/transmit ([""if (children) infected, much less likely (than adults) infect others."" applied kids infecting adults fellow 
does effect herd immunity rate? Would make threshold much lower good chunk population pre-immune?  Class rank never factor kind admission state bar, far know. last second switch make single deciding factor? That’s incredibly arbitrary unfair. Come America, follow suit! First use phone drive, safe.

But thanks explanation, 3 points make sense. Interesting hear realising ''problems'' US easy fix. 

I think fact news outlets colored point effects people's perception virus did, could really bad, almost unbelievable certainly unacceptable.

And masks, Netherlands thusfar have, want mask too. (Masks required public transport use) guestimate 10 30% people grocery stores also wear masks. Although return pretty ''harsh'' lockdown. 

I hope relatives stay healthy US citizens going realise vaccin going ''fix'' problem. Define “fun” drinking much bad news? usually detox unless drinking pretty heavily fairly long period time. Thanks sharing perspectives - happy hear views evolving beyond ‘caveman’ mentality tired late May  gotten better treating virus patients since pandemic started also keep mind die usually sick long time. It’s slow death. dads friend ICU 7 weeks passed There's plenty data available much USA citizens pay compared rest world. I've examined position plenty, thanks. doctor declaring vaccine safe everyone.

I read declaring when/if ""the doctors"" complete current trials declare safe release, *then* considered safe ""the doctors"" said safe time. Feb. thought? Definitely safe since Easter though.  Same, stop talking friend would rant post bullshit gates, 5g, ect kids become sick across country forceable reopening fall, government find way blame medical professionals instead.

Fully reopening huge risk don’t need take. I'll let pandemic know need preparation time see take break. shutdown related deaths well. massive change life inevitably causes differences suicides, domestic violence, car accidents, etc. go go down. saying shutdown caused corona deaths, also completely false. based things going... aren’t paying attention Want save economy? Wear mask.

Those don’t wear mask, want tank US economy. doubt protest would promote spread virus. pretty disappointed media covering up. used believe left media, CNN, high moral standard compared Fox. thinking vulnerable people would less likely get vaccine might likely adverse side effects. Guess wrong.   takes make rise Dolphins, would say worth it. took several days fever coughing blood go get checked tuberculosis. knew TB, denial powerful. oh weird. thanks heads up. sure could phishing, there's even form Wym “unlikely”? asking much would China sell for. wasn’t talking selling lol. asking much foreign countries I’m guessing they’d hold heads bit charge decent amount. yeah it’ll definitely take good probably several hotspots time, one. Hopefully nothing gets quite bad New York City but, well... shall see. plot twist: likely already starving, even pizza stomach problem. mean, get it, need take seriously, blatant lies hospitals overwhelmed bad fear tactic. agree harder take seriously many sources tell us many different things. want see people stop fucking idiots lot one bad event. 

I'll get new update lol. Back published also thought everyone going die bc grasp many cases actually had. 

Fl 10% hospitalization? 10% Floridas population hospital COVID19? started wearing KN95 mask everywhere go out. can’t trust everyone else part. Thankfully stocked cedar season last fall 🤷‍♀️ wear masks everywhere, wash hands, dont touch face. need ventilator I'm gonna request bunch morphine. expensive otherwise. 620 new hospitalizations day?? teacher makes $45k/yr

It's fair people trying right thing get with, small fraction want whine like children.


Stores business reopening, many idiots decided ignore guidelines. protests local governments wanted people wear masks.


Can't act right, can't wear mask, get shut again.


Quit blaming people trying help fix this.


Quit encouraging people flaunt requests simple health guidelines. don’t. people claiming it’s different convinced arbiters right wrong. protests could waited, didn’t. look hypocrites get angry people point out. say least 1%?  flatten curve. took NY overall numbers, steady incline. Also, ""flattening curve"" high numbers going help us. massive plateau completely disrespected opening up. even states shut down.

I live eastern southern side Florida. boyfriend abiding mask wearing social distancing rules since beginning. However yesterday, decided go park stop nearby restaurant afterward. park nearly empty, issue—however, inside restaurant different story! Originally, idea placing takeout order. reason, decided eating inside wouldn’t big issue since thought wouldn’t lot people there. wrong. Literally taking single step inside establishment, social distancing slightest! Usually would great distance occupied tables limited customers inside no, everyone literally top eachother. I’m aware can’t eat masks on, thought atleast I’d see 6 feet apart rule action. made anxious, uncontrollably bouncing knee table lol. servers cooks wearing masks, properly! I.e wearing mask mouth, nose vise versa. looked boyfriend looked me. kindly waited server ask could seated outside, did. 

We sat table far could mass. Unfortunately deal annoying ass flies lizards scattering tables eat them, (which great show imo.) believe LAST time ever go establishment long while. ended getting food go. 
People ignorant.. putting lot words mouth there. I've simply pointed one doctor's best-case scenario align every expert's best-case scenario. fact, one pessimistic best-case scenarios I've seen. make wrong, course, point worthy note. trop frequently referred Fenway South. officials announced nearly 7,000 new cases COVID-19 Tuesday, state's newest record confirmed cases one new record, 6,975 cases, sits far higher state's previous record around 6,000 cases one day. news comes trend lines indicate rate new infections state sharply accelerating even hotspots New York seen levels new cases officials struggled explain sharp rise cases, Texas Gov.

The lag judging strategies way longer that. months still way judge Sweden's play right one.

But one thing thankful it.  need know whether countries contained summer contain winter. need know happens antibodies wear off. many countries going find first, Sweden able tell us second months anyone else. silly pretend vaccines thoroughly vetted safety population myriad health risks.

I would try borrow different styles materials try - either wash try them, spray thoroughly isopropyl alcohol let dry.

Vaccines health - compromising immune system ensure future lifelong clients medical industry.  seems virus ""all lives"" side issue. Gilead basically company developing new antiviral drugs point. Beans. Beans. magical fruit. They'll lucky get mildly, 

And still spreading vulnerable people, grocery store employees healthcare workers lucky. Yea Upvoted you’re hilariously stupid! Gilead invested heavily produce test treatment COVID-19, tune estimated 1 billion dollars, able sell fair price. $3200 per treatment course fair - it’s well independent experts claimed fair, saves health system
money reducing hospitalizations. 

They also gave away 1.5 million doses free. disagree narrative greedy, fact generous, transparent, deserve get paid work. 

Everyone reddit thinks they’re armchair expert drug development. please, tell “the people’s dime.” gave 7% discount 7% investment, would still complaining? Japan generally sign politeness wear simple mask, want spread virus one else. Wearing mask sign ""I feeling sick"" - keep distance.

To avoid spreading virus coughing sneezing simple mask bandolla helpful. limit spread microscopic drops air.

If volunarable person someone touch covid-19 patients, simple mask help. need certified FFF2 FFF 3 mask . Talk doctor, get one. masks conformy wear. Kinda late, whatever. 

I'm pretty sure deep r/conspiracy rabbit hole, [because false. clearly see happens go single narative, get bullshit comments like ones posted yourself, claiming one narative incorrect false despite fact available option even worse option. 


Haha. I'm charge.

But also, possibly, people going beaches parks still need go restroom. think absolutely foolish ppl saying protest cause spike. ppl honestly think ppl protesting police/government going tell protest? Put data base tracing? bless heart...

Please swear online since day one.. took long figure it’s really testament stupidity. 4 questions asymptomatic cases coronavirus:

(I aware asymptomatic people still spread virus others may become symptomatic, questions able find clear answer to)

1) remain asymptomatic whole time? like possible NEVER develop symptoms?

2) mean fight virus eventually without showing symptoms dormant inside dna, causing test positive attack cells?

3) symptoms develop, mean asymptomatic individuals can't die coronavirus? symptoms theings cause death right, attacking lungs etc. symptoms basically means individual safe? (although others around wont)

4) heard studies viral count asymptomatic people higher symptoms. that? possible viral particles show symptoms, extra viral particles causing cell membranes explode viral production? Guess buddy? point beyond right well. Fuck Arizona! Florida NUMBAH 1! USA NUMBAH 1 probably reopened casinos (and things) then, huh? That's really strange Hitman DLC... really perfect storm brewing country. They've nurturing anti-intellectual rhetoric longer I've alive, obsessed individual entitlement, wealth property. Hope come senses. **Mayor:** want grow like Americans, you?

**Canadians:** \*looking ground, shuffling feet\* No...! eat enough well irresponsible reopening sort perfect storm. Back March barely 1,000 cases US, attending physician congress sugessted 70-150 million Americans contract COVID-19 end this: Fauci's numbers, could happen 2 years. Keep mind fastest humanity ever developed produced vaccine 4 years mumps. vaccine next 6 months, numbers may end exactly right almost 1 2 Americans contracted illness. Horrifying. know probably sometimes think country doomed.  120 vaccine candidates. numbers game. need many advance possible.. one advances increases chances success. final vaccine? cares? suspicion crazy method administration eliminate it, even works great. need fucking ray gun give jab. Seems justified definitely sensationalist/disturbing comment begin with. often wonder flu vaccine capped effectiveness. effective strain strain take over. 

Luckily case Covid.  people already diagnosed cancers receiving ongoing care. mostly people health conditions option managing via medication surgeries in-person care put off. people know whose surgeries/chemo essential never stopped going hospital. 

E.g. I've seeing oncologist remission follow-ups person, cardiologist high blood pressure (a complication due chemo treatment) via tele-health. go see former, hospital's cancer center. busy chemo weekly two years ago. differences: temperature checks door, everyone wearing masks and/or face shields, chairs spaced one sit near stranger. screwed, everyone going end getting virus. time comes hopefully pull lock cases go down, say ahh fuck open anyway. time nascent industries advances country’s interests. 

Subsidies. 

Or pay higher prices. effectively kill us. starting ferret non-human primate studies soon, look good too, may something here. photo shoot first week May. started showing symptoms May 27th.

And agree you. said article, “I photo shoot family followed guidelines.” Instead said “The time left house go walks.” true. Again, follow rules applaud that. still fuck (a tiny bit) giving us details. That's half story. also need know people asymptomatic, research explore question. particular, infection load (the amount virus take moment infection) matter terms severity? I'm increasingly thinking does, lot. countries also regulation prevent shape form. require masks. distancing students. using previous normal. us stupid would ship back zero precaution don’t.

Only initial positive counts FL.

They note FDoH webpage see give demographic data every single.

Negatives however, counted matter what, two negatives needed go back work help pad stats exact opposite way father thinks. would help unemployment too! see Karens can’t shut interstate travel absolutely make quarantine true. fast food restaurants. would go eat vegetables would serve us. Instead force hamburgers french fries upon us. Shame them. fact takes many minutes destroy virus reduces effectiveness sunlight. anything someone walks cubicle coughs breathes directly you, HVAC vent expels onto you. start thinking sunlight makes immune. sit back debate efficacy masks, government continues pump billions walstreet. absurd. safety net left one making. debate masks day night, 1% doesn’t care. Actually would rather stay bickering. another 200-300k die? what. economy doesn’t care, walstreet doesn’t care. longer prolong debate stuff easily slid nose. 

How CFPB ruling day Supreme Court? trump ability directly fire leadership install cronies charge it. 

It really blows mind. Many people argue “but economy, can’t let economy suffer!” Okay answer this. wages gone considerably relation market? No? Well obviously holdings 401k IRA? much? 

So risking health stagnant paycheck hopes 10% gain 5,000$ 401k still okay?

They usually response. medical copay/deductible week icu would drain average Americans 401 heartbeat. Yet fight “economy” failed basic math. Masks don’t kill people, COVID-19 kills people don’t understand people don’t think this. Put mask on, social distance, wash hands, maybe keep things going. 340 million Americans infected Coronavirus, think number deaths would be? America become absolute embarrassment many levels also lots shouting chanting. great environment preventing spread respiratory disease quote, ""more effective placebo"" boosting recovery times 4 days

To fair, seem valuable hospital beds fill up. Getting people door sooner end saving lives, even actively save anyone taking it. Unfortunately, easily reachable. definitely important governors send strong message right now, Cuomo seems good job like said. honestly know much Cuomo, even though we're far away found briefings reassuring way. Much stronger we're getting here, least! 'Merica idiots winning? weren’t saying back March then? Could’ve told public wear face coverings didn’t. Don’t act like didn’t fuck before. Perhaps don’t see big picture. virus requires entire planet changes everything end sight. It’s going go away. conform soon take mandated vaccine rushed trials. thank you. choose live free get it, get it. drive even though dying accident possibility. faith destined suffer long miserable life.

Especially use talk people. may able escape god, sure hell ignore stupid There’s lot unpack here, favorite quote epic rant following:

“So cameras, 5G comes what? We’re gonna get scanned? They’re gonna scan everybody gotta get scanned got get temperatured? kids go school masks? INSANE?!?”

Also gotta love storms end thinking fucking nailed presentation think dumb is.....

There people actually follow guys lead. exactly long ago protests? Unless Sweden, seems like wierd trivia info place reply comments. Curious everyone worried outdoor 4th July celebrations people worried protests.

The ones went literally 30% mask thats Considering number children world, 99% vs 94% may seem like small difference, that's roughly 110,000,000 children difference would non-mild symptoms -- HUGE difference.

Covid spreads much rampantly flu, EVEN 1% fatality rate, EVEN infected ~40% world, thats still roughly 30 million dead. Anyone downplays severity disease trying pull percentages ass disgusting.

Edit: disease itself! much millions fatalities second degree effect disease -- killing food production workers, etc, instance. Causing overflow hospitals normal diseases (e.g. heart attack etc) could treated hospital able to. always hear stories people affected likely live multi-generational homes close knit family communities. know get others help out. OK. shirts kill bunch people either. 

I've seen working fine btw. 

And I've left without ordering lunch working.

The major difference places last 2 weeks level support &amp; urgency coming management. 

I also know pub owner another establishment little farther away, he'll throw ass one polite warning. 

But talking chain franchise establishment strip mall yeah.. imagine places totally ingrained follow path least resistance, rock boats, avoid ""being managed"" like plague. (pun intended) anything direct transmission, like someone coughs near you. Yeah bad Karens Portland give shit. continue give shit.  Catholic discourse Dallas actually mandated churches reopen long local government said could....

We major metro. That’s every Catholic Church city surrounding suburbs. got sick, slight fever, it? Yeah others, done ME?! pssh. 

/s let out... THANK response. knew made sense, thanks confirming comment also non-partisan. stating fact elected leader state Maryland. wait turns causes cancer three years time. Takeout safe. know many kitchen staff wearing masks back house Mordor temperature little ventilation. Problem outside seating realistic lot restaurants. seen really well utilized. wouldn’t stress much. that’s great point tbh, think people less uninformed moreso intentionally noncompliant end day expect government recognize they, people, control power every aspect anyone's money all. exists government people's imagination desire.

So would expect educated populous, therefore government, act responsibility inheretid power wields.

We avoid unnecessary risks, time goes think becomes hard keep things black white. think I'd personally position travel spend significant time indoors people outside household- know others already done so.

Ask questions:

1. at-risk higher risk complications?
2. share household someone risk higher risk? (for return).
3. people coming hotspot areas?
4. attending taking steps reduce risk getting virus? (Do believe virus real? going work? practicing social distancing? Wearing masks?)
5. Could take trip physically distanced? E.g., separate nearby campsites cabins- meeting outdoors day, etc.

None black white answers dealbreakers, think would help evaluate risk. would remind alternative comparing (no trip) 100% successful outcome- makes pretty tough justify much risk. Ughhhhhh Hahahahahah. Gold.  what, outdoor it?

Haven't protests proven outside transmission negligible, even shouting yelling shoulder shoulder proximity?

We're even back pride* believe he's intelligent puts on, think he's chess master Bobby Fischer level intelligent. unexpected, all. People going bars give one fuck 

'I gonna live life scared stay home hide bro' Coworkers 6 months wearing masks. social distancing. don’t care ask reasoning hearing proclaim don’t work. I’m one wears one tries stay away people. 

I’m trying wrap head around logic imagine they’ll say someone gets it. work closed office one social distances except desk. don’t seem care much conversations close distance even sit next one another.

The guy asthma coughs everywhere, hand, doesn’t even wear one.

I don’t get it?! vaccines years human safety trials, yet happy take one humans potentially 6 months most. cautious anti-vaxx. end? put tracer (as bouncer/ like security) every open entrance every casino open right every bar/ restaurant still running (I even trust curbside). wearing N95 mask distancing properly staying home, nobody spread you. Frankly position almost selfish choosing wear mask. basically saying personal position stable enough care pandemic extended another months even years. Let tested people desperate you.  countries closed schools cases among children remain low. things get wargamed time public preparedness.

And directives completely ignored incompetent administrations He’s probably going fired saying truth. Man, damn weird shitty frat bar town center national discussion. Yes, MI bars reopening particular ones cater younger people seems disaster. really hope governor impose closures bars regions state again. said, overall situation MI amung best country. really rough March April urban centers state got rocked, better NY per capital basis also shit quite bit earlier. pretty healthy test capacity (hit almost 20k days 10mil population) tracing system working well enough actually know 100ish cases Harper's east Lansing.

MI belong list I'm thrilled DOD sending folks back forth across border right now. Yep, population support old. Great idea. countries low birth rates already hitting problem. almost like work required amass $15k worse quick death realy gets wondering US government leaders real goal lower population count. I'm talking combining kids based family groups based handful elementary schools. many areas could radius less 10 miles.

I'm struggling imagine place super intense traffic low housing density. LA maybe? Valid point spread infection older demographics, hospitalisation numbers increase again. 

FTFY Ah ah ah. Hanlon's razor. really need better discussion Americans best boost immune system natural defense.  I'm trying avoid inferring.

However, experience doctors, reading drug trials. go whatever endorsement handed them.

I'm health care worker older doctors experience continued independent studies drug trials.

They read pamphlet pharma reps leave.

There additional educational requirements meet mostly get elect classes.

I've trying actually get doctors create curriculum goals get much push back. ""I time."" or, ""I rarely deal disease I'd rather focus Zika."" live south carolina, governor enforce quarantine, telling south carolinians basically police use common sense. even need say that's happening? point surprised discover also leads hair loss erectile dysfunction. Source lasting health complications? That's what's crazy me. became meme, people wanting risk pandemic haircut. haircut? serious right now? utterly insane always going break pressure. Humanity survived species beginning due cooperation other, competition. virus care single bit Kansas politics. People keep acting like defy brazen out. *virus*. neither negotiate frighten away. look pitchers Oh, don’t misunderstand - I’m doubting all. I’m sure you’ve done research, examined plenty trustworthy sources. You’re well-acquainted data, get it. good bro. 

All I’m saying easy cite trustworthy source back claims, like said, there’s much data support it. take numbers nothing done 1% gigantic freaking number. that's people realizing. Wear mask. Give world break. face &amp; opinion frighten people.  land free, home idiots........ take equivalent risk worst vaccines made last 50 years getting COVID-19. risk even vaccine ""high"" complication rate almost certainly outweigh risk long term damage virus. Shit, might be. weirdest year ever. wouldn’t even surprised find I’m also another person... Damn, Jacobson vs Massachusetts face masks? could sure use Texas. would hurt themselves? shortsighted? know bunch ppl getting ICU level hurt COVID19? 

Florida apparently outlier. 

The overall cumulative COVID-19 associated hospitalization rate 4.6 per 100,000, highest rates persons 65 years older (13.8 per 100,000) 50-64 years (7.4 per Best case scenario wait hours results, that's laboratory build airport. let's imagine airports spare rooms put people waiting results, let's imagine build testing laboratories, let's imagine tourists willing wait hours airport tests. test 100 people airplane enter airport, put dedicated room hours. one comes positive. do? can't quarantine let 99 leave, spent hours room infected person. whole exercise simply impossible.  Fucken shit hole bavarian space project logo

And project? curious don’t believe ever happen.  Snowflakes seeking safe space. honestly, say f\*ck it, go ahead China, Germany- infringe patent, save lives deal lawsuits later. Yeah one gets hardest, havent even lost anyone -yet- find cruel disgusting. continues it. dont even want think would feel lost someone hearing pull shit. One things like working home air conditioned office. keep cold wear sweatshirt whenever I'm sitting desk. 

In NY winters would go cars indoors quickly possible hardly spend time outdoors. FL opposite. Go AC AC avoid outdoors.

(Unrelated making goal least go kayak fishing weekend summer, past years kinda stopped fishing June-Sept got super bored summer) breakdown trauma regions go V. concerning see Area E (Dallas area) 1,375 patients, 442 ICU beds available, Area P (San Antonio) 1,010 patients 137 ICU beds available, Q (Houston) 2,059 patients 183 ICU beds available. looks like three hot spots around major cities. areas seem ok, Austin seems ok COVID patients 388 97 ICU beds available must full things. I'm assuming standard ICU capacities expanded

Edit: One additional note antibody tests pretty low % around 3.5% positive great. Yay! money give rich fucks bought scratch map son Christmas (it's travel map, scratch countries visited). Except FOOD cook countries. done wonders us, love picking countries trying food really expanded menu.

Be warned! Turkey countries traditional dishes take LONG TIME cook, man tasty!!

&amp;#x200B;

We may wrong cases, Americans trying broaden tastes knows we're actually cooking things actual country we're trying. One favorites Dolmasi Azerbaijan, yum! doubt, mudsling 

Sad!  Depends vaccine.

If Moderna vaccine gets approval, plan 100 million doses ready end year ramping 100 million doses/month capacity. advantage vaccine easy produce, though.

I think likely vaccines end similar timelines, need eventually produce almost 8 billion doses, happen unless produce billions doses per year.

The biggest question mark initial approval comes (if ever). People need card long wear mask face 0 repercussions.

Fines. Jail. Pepper spraying. need make happen.  cannot imagine keeping company plague rats vacations planned right regardless whether forced right thing due fines. give fuck them. knew anything. Any-thing. internet security would know totally fucked, government wants spy us. Injecting chip going allow find 5% faster would checked cell tower records. Ya. You’ve made far. You’re actually wearing mask it’s face. wear right. still got month too!  feed hateful troll. see, one ""those people"" believes pandemic media propaganda. say news biggest hospital Houston run ICU beds? Great news. Really seems like hot spots need put back control. Hashtag FloridaStupid Given fact possible idea withholding information virus early stages blacklisting countries getting vaccine, international crisis? wont wear mask intell January didnt issue travel ban china.

""We first country introduce travel bans China criticised that. Many state governments run Democratic governors act federal government, even though free so.""

Where hell come title? read article, saw nothing said title says. misleading. hitting us. Corona give shit politics! We're trying put political twist fucking virus literally killing people. leaders fucked response handling ""situation"". leaders made mistakes. fucking President acts like hoax. left right made sure personally financially benefit this. governors sides say absolute dumbest shit I've ever seen heard. said done, comes society handled this. choice, gooberment says, media says, Karen Facebook says what's best fellow human beings. Majority society chose whatever fuck wanted, bars, parties, beaches, vacations, protests, riots, coughing people Walmart, mean fuckin went out. sides. right, left, EVERYONE decided say ""I social distance"" ""I wear mask"". two things cause this, stems huge lack leadership country.

Edit: spelling Yea type people travel right also unlikely quarantine themselves. us would desire travel anyway.  fast food/takeout joint, think worth all. chances staff getting sick, money lose closed send sanitation crew.

Except she’s govt employee people exactly paying healthcare. really annoys see someone wear mask like that. creditors beginning help either. deferments credit cards, car loans student loans. We’re heading point kids fall behind far won’t able make without extreme remediation, one wants spend money (and that’s get kids back paying attention caring education, already big struggle lost soft skills big demonstration little actually value education).

So it’s trade parents getting sick versus getting education, seriously fuck entire life up. That’s also assuming children potential contagion point, unlikely poor households parents either forced work outside home matter risk favorable things like queue hours food banks.

Don’t try switch onto me. You’re one telling someone hope die.

Oh I’m upset. stating facts.

It’s ok though, you’re fueled emotions get it. teenager also.

Aw look little guy attacking instead argument, cute. going school significant unknown period time? don’t think there’s research idea yet likely almost amount education better none all. least keep kids vaguely behavioral patterns need learning (like sitting paying attention 10-50 minutes based age appropriateness). 

Plus solution what, put kids’ educations unknown significant amount time. haven’t paid much attention newest vax news keep seeing best might something mass distribution “early” next year. maybe get kids back school early March we’re really lucky ????? we’re not? good point, something keep mind protestors young, probably massively notice spike lack symptoms. possible there's another couple week lag see bringing families co-workers.

The reason virus tricky spreads easily people know read Fauci Pucci.

But wow. scary disease lot know, look closer articles well. think learned thus far coronaviruses develop immunity eventually slows either due everyone getting vaccinated would surprising. still lot deaths go regardless. staying home months ago. laughing stock first world. FU masks BS, right put people families risks feel like wearing one! makes hair look weird.

/s aaaaallllll economy... 😒  one cares anymore.

The business work caters specifically tourists time record June volume/revenue. stemming bleeding, economically keeping business life support bodes better 50% failure rate. happens end largest ones weather storm, pick scraps pennies dollar. control market bunch single industry monopolies. This. teacher, always aim what’s best students, little discussion safety much also spreading virus. mention unpredictability constant shutdowns reopenings effect working parents, lack enough buses space routes timely manner, complete lack substitute teachers even pandemic, costs constant cleaning crews sanitizing (especially bathrooms students staff), cost PPE staff, whether we’re even allowed require students wear masks, allowed, issue students taking masks eat together classroom (CDC recommendation). 

There endless logistical issues. examples: high risk students going nurse’s office daily meds may encounter sick students, manage whenever staff member quarantine due positive family member, finding subs fill jobs 2+ weeks, paid sick leave (this cost state lot money districts don’t budget that), shared AC ventilation (big problem we’re seeing currently restaurants south), contact trace school new case pops up, etc. could seriously go on. 

Schools literally buildings hundreds (and high school level, thousands) kids adults crammed together small spaces require sharing supplies talking loudly day long. fact it’s almost ridiculous think could work efficiently, unless small percentage students staff show up. hate say it, think attempting in-person learning year giant waste time, money, importantly, end killing high risk people including kids’ family members teachers. need tread carefully this, seeing consequences careful reopening businesses. predict see Swexit within 10 years tbh got tested couple days tested positive. exposed least 5 days prior. It’s two weeks since started showing symptoms none gotten sick. heard interview awhile ago talking can't actually fired position. appointed executive branch position. Now, Trump remove coronavirus task force whenever wants to.  Exactly, shouldn’t lockdowns all. Theres scientific basis medieval style treatment. positive cases mean deaths necessarily. Case point: Many new positive cases are: 


\-Those 40 
\-Asymptomatic  


Far less newer cases result deaths older ones mostly involved older sick people.  


People getting wrong thinking. would expect deaths soon skyrocketing deaths like many thinking happen. saw one senators (no idea where, I'm Canadian) CNN bitching Fauci sure schools open. fuck would know? Every prediction makes gets fucked government's lack concern literally anything economy... Fauci honestly deserves award patience idiots. Maybe mask wars finally kill the, ""customers always right"" mantra. another clickbait article sign in, jump hoops etc--even read browser can't defeat spam. seems like half posts like anymore. sacred cow du jour headline, imagine bs. doctors nurses encouraging people protest large groups. might wearing high? usually wear cloth mask quarter inch away eyes keep glasses fogging (also glasses help hold mask bit). could little lower still n95s since little metal thing seal around nose properly. think kids need parents, lungs, kidneys more.

Until pandemic control, hurt tremendously every day spend sheltering place. NEED 5% !!!!!!!! WEAR FUCKING FACEMASK !!!! It’s weird cause effect thing. Oh god, could melodramatic? apparently can't read. CDC.

98 per 100,000 population need hospitalization 

4.6 per 100,000 infected need hospitalization. I'm one misreading lol. good one. someone sees person fighting idiot, person watching assumes they're idiots. good day. 

It's like CFR IFR like Amazon hoarders, worse! naive stupid best, dangerous point.  

keep telling it’s ok it’s test younger population. vaccine though, it? Yeah, pangolins bats Europe, unquenchable hunger bat pangolin meat.  crazy N.C. didn’t make people NY quarantine headed outta NY. especially beaches reopened NY, NJ folks flocked here. This.

If child must attend school person, consider it... elsewhere. Florida starting surge, let’s hold comparisons states first wave run it’s course masks on!!! thought face diaper protected everyone? Yeah great, since they're rare also tend kind debauched seem amplify weird drinking culture, like sudden released beer prison go ham. wish chill acceptable people drink park square everywhere.  They'd share everyone look like hero. cost $1B develop, 93% privately funded. don’t let get way narrative.  ITT: one reading article making fool themselves. “... also found significant association repeat infections symptom severity ... Conclusion: study provides evidence re-infections endemic coronavirus [strain] atypical time window shorter 1 year...”

The abstract first article posted goes almost projected here. I’ll admit check second article, Vox hardly peak medical journalism, also see numbers/percentages mentioned either. beach probably one safest places be. see spread protests, tightly packed beach, know we'd expect see spread beaches. boatloads data indicating outdoor spread virus incredibly low. 

&amp;#x200B;

While well intentioned, I'm afraid people going spend July 4 indoors, someone's house, rather outdoors beach. guess eat locusts. Also, thank you, aware CDC messed test delayed test development others, refresher learned Trump fired HHS IG report. 

So much keep track of. propaganda machine .01% rich class trying convince poor class vote best interest. 

It’s extremely effective. Hey so, might believe this, least one person who's life going absolutely destroyed leave. likely more.

I get it. wanna kill regular basis. thing keeps realization much would ruin lives people love me, lose unexpectedly.

Please, seek help. something makes happy. try talk someone know irl. Or, someone know. talk someone. life purpose know life painful, little blips pain make everything worth it.

Well, look caught 😂 Can't even open article, browser says ""Error. much stupid."" simply said concerns Oxford vaccine's progress, would said something now. know combative here.

And responded we're still discovery phase. cannot notify people discovery currently discovered.

There's cart. horse. order little fucked goes They're pretty confident vaccine ready end year *no* agency going say ""here, take this!"" without knowing does,

I never said anything ingredients. say vaccine inadequately tested cardiologist family member someone I'd go vaccination advice.

It's weird poor understanding human body see separation concerns issue cardiologist opining vaccine rooted heart. thing cardiologists deal happened lucked Oxford midway coronavirus vaccine could tinkered bit compatible hypothetically combat SARS-Covid-2 proven safe effective.

It proven neither safe effective. they're studied say anything public forum without fact-checking, thanks.

I mean, declared virus safe effective neither proven. whoever make metric fuck ton money. Biotech weird though. INO phasing vaccine stock drop almost 20% release good news. People buy expected jump price bail moment news drops. Erring side caution completely different meaning pandemic importantly, relinquish parental rights. damn frustrating watch numbers climb know rise positive tests hospitalizations shortly followed mounting number casualties. Nothing learned Italy's horrific experience, one seems paid slightest attention well-documented equally horrific period spring NYC, idiots yammering hard breathe cloth mask saying stupid crap 'right' breathe free. idea people could really stupid face collective peril ... hard admit thought humans rational creatures (although last 20 years already put serious dent optimistic belief). Except mask wearing data behind americans choosing ignore.

There's literally data showing virus spreading food, that's scaremongering. glad there's proof spreading food rather trying push weird agenda, spread food would make cooking home difficult, too, unless grow food well. thinking 10 seconds remembered Biden wears black mask. Yes, actually working Memorial Hermann hospital, place believe referring to, long ago. personally went covid medication overstock verified it. also travel every major hospital country job. would like see proof claim. Oh see it. benefits them. Well, small minority them, toddlers still follow bitter end. mention fact almost seems self inflicted areas mask social distancing orders delayed, scoffed purely given altogether. I'm looking evidence claim 2 3 weeks cases spike deaths. 

Because people die disease die 3-4 weeks infection stage. get positive test results usually week infection, 2-3 weeks left live.

Its logical combination 3 facts: 1) cases spiking, 2) infections likely happened week ago average, 3) deaths generally occur 3-4 weeks infection. also true.  little dated mean, filling live. Shit rate catching even gone despite reopenings protests. definitely something varies area live in. didn’t see many posts criticizing grocery store workers fast food food workers. anything, people probably think get raise cause sinfully underpaid, especially time like this. But, complete corporate greed always prevents things like that. no, responding quickly. Sorry dude. Gotta sports........... would reasonable position, already know, position took. “You can’t tell tiny little bar problem. He’s problem,” Parker, one multiple Texas bar owners banned wearing masks establishments, said Abbott interview Washington Post. “He’s targeting us, it’s discrimination.”

So much stupid... point? know actual case number much higher. mask mandate indeed plan contain virus help people could make healthcare industry, president's buddies private corps many trillions.

Pretty obvious whats going on.  working class expected sacrifice name corona. listening podcast interview one top retrovirus experts world. estimated would take minimum two years covid-19 vaccine developed.  


As question, said complicated get podcast HIV unique features make particularly difficult develop vaccine it. Covid-19 apparently peculiarities. San Francisco, Minneapolis!, Chicago, many cities. 

The coronavirus outbreaks correlated protests. correlated things like early reopening mask use. There's difference unhealthy health condition though. I'm disagreeing overall point, comparing someone afflicted polio moribly obese drug addict like comparing sour apple raw sewage. Interesting. curiosity, sources saying cases linked protests? 

I ask I've twice run Americans making claim, sources provided said ""there noticeable increase total cases"" following protests. articles proceeded speculate protests increase spread curfews anxiety surrounding violence protests may helped keep others doors counterbalanced protest spread. 

I'm curious ""No cases"" linked protests, ""no net increase"" pinned protests. insult mangos like  Also, challenge studies interesting. pretty much BATH animals virus. Way higher human viral load. Please show I'm wrong. posted actual numbers. That's incredibly depressing. makes herd immunity easy then.

/s Something something, stopped clocks... wouldn’t say every part government. federal government blown it, states cities done well. person refuses vaccines hurts people puts whole communities risk. Stop conflating risking ones health risking community health. good luck dipshits- hope lose money attorneys grifting ass, lose bars. SCOTUS long ago determined personal liberty absolute, government may take action infringes public health purposes... 

 day America actually changes healthcare system better day pigs learn fly. quite clear zero chance form universal healthcare system Yeah she’s gym.... people breathe heavily, sweat, touch everything. part go underground remain surface? havent seen suggested think people turn AC summer theyve lost mind. Ill take virus instead. Oh, trash neolib proposal? fucking surprise UV light great potential treating respiratory virus long intensity controlled. mortality rate likely 1% total, significantly lower people 60 immunocompromised. So, agree. 

I've fine complying greater good, starting feel like nothing. country plan, vaccine unlikely widely available least year (and serious Hail Mary), I'm really restricted area compared rest country (SF Bay Area). need wait RNC convention. may every well find weeks Tulsa Arizona rallies. sound like you’ve lost argument. seem like it. Checking data Arizona daily increase new hospitalization barely changed since March although daily increase new cases spiking quite substantially. plotted [link](http://imgur.com/gallery/X440FXp) Feel free double check data correct wrong

Also add, leads believe testing done folks without severe symptoms. good thing imo, need even tests less. gives us information isolate positive cases vulnerable population thus less hospitalizations less death. Honestly pandemic protocol written OUTSIDE pandemics. already something place varying severity pandemics. I'd say ""you live learn"" politicians 1940s 1990s lived 1918 pandemic.  I've trying find exact words! Uhh, AZ 100% ICU capacity since early June per CovidActNow.org ""safe return"" order? Wait, opened bars water parks etc schools? fuck wrong you. mean colleges unis like? It’s worst 1/5 dangerous regular flu.

The article didn’t even mention anyone dying it. It’s non-issue pick different horse. USA USA. Make America Banned Again! find replacement janitors, worries lol! /r/bestofreddit Good know Canada needs. 
We well aware trumps failures. It’s cluster point. would rather let pandemic rampage country admit he’s wrong. That’s danger president, worse incompetent, president puts ego ahead everyone everything else. 99% people grocery store wearing masks, amazingly well. area, mask wearers minority. I'd say 20-30% people wear here. take courage compassion wear mask. humans defective.   Lol omg. believe this? CCP cares power control. care life ran college students tanks washed paste like remains sewers.   curiosity circle back you? heavily, mean heavily mocked back February watching shit storm unfold overseas trying tell coworkers/friends/family please cautious prepare now. can’t even tell amount texts got soon shut like “holy shit man called it, know?!?” Really wasn’t rocket science anyone actually paying attention global events... does! essentially antibodies horses - effect, giving another source antibodies harvested critically ill COVID patients may need them. ballpark? Possibly , Etiwanda '08 ! right, death threat though. difference saying “I hope get hit bus” “I going kill bus now” clear evidence premeditated plans it. full message even said directly threatening it. Thinking like piece shit isn’t crime. See Wisconsin virus basically niled forced back open idiotic partisan judges starting get bad. poor using raft pushed drowned... didn’t careful, may become competition businesses get wall. San Diego here, places within 5 miles coast built early 2000s don’t AC. Inland hotter generally AC like southwest hot areas. coastal SoCal traditionally kind common AC last 10-20 years. hockey-stick? say hell? dopes worried 5G! Hahaha joke’s them! :D doubt. wouldn’t advocate go full CCP(unless thought necessary), moral taking virus seriously taking massive precautions including isolating infected peoples regions. mortality swine flu os worst 1/5 flu.. vaccine it. I've never understood whole ""USA number one"" shit. mean America never best country many developed countries beat America alot things like education, healthcare etc. thing America going developed countries global power(being superpower) highest GDP mean much average American though. 2 slow ominous beats play background vast white... Human trial India vaccine July one person? That’s stretch. Eh, kinda. Finally Thursday actually admitted problem, anything ask us pretty please wear masks. that, would say surge capacity worry. 

As potential field hospitals staffed outside Arizona, I'm pretty sure plan. press conference q&amp;a today, I'm confident we're actually ready. mean, we're already enacting triage crisis protocols, fully utilized surge capacity? I'm exhausted, add me.

Unless get influx people (and ppe, another issue)... I'm scared next couple months. infection:death ratio seems low far, nice, that’s lot cases. crisis mode adequate PPE. really kind standard practice, honest. takes time die disease. fatalities occur 2ish weeks onset symptoms. We're getting started. frail jail - haha loved that, sadly locked already phase 3. article week old. indoor only?

If gonna it, better all. Yeah well put bro. Unfortunate system screw lower class struggles also made harder people want help actually help.

It's stuff like really make want go full anarchy terrorism. Learning things school long they've going really degraded trust system.

The best luck man, shit really going hit fan hard soon. read Biden's platform website really believe he'll make reforms necessary, hope restriction executive power increased oversight/transparency actually gets implemented cause seems like start least.

No confidence it'll go hope better nothing. Interesting! indication quickly could made available? need go testing vaccine?  joke. tell boss. Arizona seems hell bent wanting experience NY nightmare themselves. know morons running hospitals acquired sufficient PPE now, they've months upon months buy sufficient PPE. least medical centers Texas seem stocked heavily PPE, wtf facilities Arizona time? It’s pretty small club Nashville. Even “half capacity” it’s pretty full. It’s smart all. live?  here's data specifically related pandemic UV light lungs

The day Xinfadi identified source spread moved military police (equivalent national guard) completely surround area, one one exception. Many vendors/restaurants going facing bankruptcy. option buy disruption insurance also collect unemployment. forced close allows option both.

Remember saying states should’ve prepared pandemic? goes ways.. found dashboard hospital push it. eventually data get correct hands. get major spotlight national level sadly. would want kids money pits lol, disappointed scrolled back check name. Andrew Lloyd Weber's channel. Unfortunately we're ALW's content like Phantom Opera Cats, we're onto NBC live musicals great came two decades ago. mean I'll stop watching though; I'll need wine lol. landlords sell property mega corporations buy jack rents. looks like paranoid schizophrenic becomes famous. infamous, suppose. Imagine many lives lost harder, stupider way. That's good start day testing! sadly must decline invitations join due various circumstances must understand. Going need samples ""research"" said cases would go without precautions said ""it's fake hoax"". "" afraid stay home!"".Cases spike ""it's increased testing"", Fl governer says tv increase due increased testing. excuse ""oh well affecting young healthy people worse cold"" and. ""It's protests bars."" even matters people giving little kids. lady fb said son, wife 6 month old baby positive. Another lady asked anyone lysol husband positive want 3 yr old getting it. Wow. Yeah. Especially considering stupid people be... those? croatia Canada waiting till last phase allow bars indoor dining great far Agree sentiment probably isn’t heroic feeling. heroic people don’t want hero. want normal life. politicians fucking vampires. God damn right. Glad someone finally said it. Planet Fitness business actually wanted get HUGE bite gym membership industry 2020.

They invested heavily advertising across major cities.

They even donated thousands Happy New Years hats glasses New Years celebration Times Square.

Little know, 60 days later entire industry would go shit. operating loss due upfront investment, club keep open desperate hope stay red... DEEP!  💯 Yea 30 years stagnate wages. 10 years legalizing political bribery since ""corporations people"" donations via ""super pac"" disclose donating who... . 

Should free public elections, also national holiday allow us vote, allow small individual donations only, bare minimum allow multi millionair donate 500K politician, TRANSPARENT.......anyone everyone donates individual based disclosed top 10 donaters are. 

Make super pac illegal, say corporations PEOPLE. 

I go corruption....I'm sure u already know this. embarrassing laws rules literally even hiding doing. slap face Americans. Shit even ppl making 200K year, doctors making 450K lawyers/white collar workers.  rules set billionaires multi millionairs. 

Government literally working select few. even say working white collar people. Shit even doctors always rich, live great life even complains obama care bloated administration department causing headaches unable actually treat patients want treat. Doctors, majority em want treat, heal honestly make lives better system even saying fuck doctors nurses.  

So again, yes system completely incompatible poor, low class, blue collar middle class people even alot white collar jobs.  shame honestly   states huge problem paranoia current elected leader essentially doorway big rabbit hole dark, complicated, wipply wobbly ideas. Surge capacity planned phase one emergency management. becomes overwhelmed, national guard called set manage temporary hospitals. Yes, damn concerning headed wrong direction. Qualified Staffing biggest problem, Covid patients.  good news influenza vaccines easy. lots practice infrastructure. last swine flu pandemic US first cases spring. fall several vaccines time flu season. suspect continue putting h1n1 strain flu shots years. know past two. grocery shortages ever problem? staples trouble getting lasted short time. put restrictions number items per customers, hoarding stopped. number people end life long lung damage organ damage tracked. imagine devastating medical costs too. Texas, like many states, forbids sale alcohol intoxicated persons. bars refuse close, say Abbott sets task force make spot checks regarding this.. sell intoxicated person lose license 8-12 days first offense, 16-24 days second, it’s revoked third offense. want dicks it, state.  40 accounts nearly 50% Columbus population plus median age 32. 

One ‘well shit’ articles. Well live next county I’m freaking yet people telling calm down. testing San Bernardino county seems around 2800-3000 day. Appts test booked til July 6th San Bernardino county bordering LA county cities Claremont Pomona. reported 296 cases. 2 million residents. two huge malls see tens thousands visitors inland empire. Buffets open aren’t supposed health department doesn’t even know. Restaurants hiding cases employees cases employees hiding cases don’t lose jobs. It’s certified shit show gonna bad even shut yesterday. next phase argument accuse hospitals full crisis actors diagnosing everything corona make huge sums money. It’s still required. Unfortunately it’s required doesn’t mean everyone comply. It’s also impossible enforce city-wide. Agreed. Deaths right still low well. Either going negatively affected already got morality rate extremely low general fishing caught me. Hahahaha. can’t, US state. legal imposing 2 week quarantine upon visitors.    probably tested upon admission already file already Lol though. Look Quantum-Dot Tattoos, research done MIT funded Bill Gates. conspiracies come thin air. stigma, ***SOMEBODY*** decided spend years convincing Americans science evil distrusted principal, human lives worth saving means giving ""rights"" hurt people far often not. Fair point. We’re eager nail definitive facts base models estimations set expectations by. they’re....elusive. But, again, we’ve dealing thing handful months now. even half year, although feels like more. much yet learn. Kansas City place I’ve ever heard someone use n word public malice. protest, downtown Friday night. thought someone get murdered. know government New Zealand saying border God give us pandemic handle  always ""but muh freedoms!"" ""but muh constitutional rights!"" almost always person spouting bunch nonsensical falsehoods. think need start teaching civics schools. Also protest crowds. Let’s include groups responsible even doesn’t fit narrative. Ha, back day I’d win prize nailing guess. 

For awhile wished hadn’t known life used like I’m grateful perspective. Oh, don’t wanna risk dialysis rest life?! Yeah, neither. Shit scary lol replied with, ""No, respond white *trash*."" he'd need respond... dilemmas trying find ways troll trolls..   Oh, hypocrisy NJ charts

[Lockdown protesters cited breaking right protest,"" Murphy said Wednesday daily press briefing Trenton. “I wish would home. don’t agree this. Please don’t claim we’re patriotic. … love country, love state, do. We’re trying save lives.

Weeks later, BLM protests, many many times number people. lord hypocrisy asking people ""protest home"" time? [Sure look government, led d!psh!t, deciding protests valid. can't even remember f constitution point. Everybody Michigan got tired humidity 90's AC finally got cheap enough wealthy. wonderful day kid central air installed.

2. Moon

The end. Ah selfish cunt then... Got think death rates inaccurate they’re skewed low. wondering somebody going show make subtle excuses/concessions. ""really shitty insurance"" exist medical, least I've never encountered personally heard it, seems common way dick someone America though.

And ""pay too"", yeah pay taxes everyone get medical care free, think Australia pays ludicrous premium America things like Insulin? government cops 540 dollars per vial chin American would to, somehow procure less 30 dollars (mostly free script) pharmacies, government absorb 500 dollars us cause they're nice? No, actually imported literally 8-10x cheaper, demand be, negotiate prices medication competitive import regulations pricing reinforce that. America meanwhile freemarket fuckfest charge whatever deem fit drug- saves lives? Even expensive, gouge poor vulnerable people like. Cost literally 4 cents per pill make? Wow, better inflate price 12,000%

There equivalence health care systems besides standard care- think many Americans would like believe they're worse off, reality even close. Even Americans mythical ""really good insurance"", bet they've still paid pocket costs regular run mill stuff lifetime uninsured Australian. Yeah children quick internalize self blame matter situation. 

My dad murdered stepfather 15. stepdad called 30 minutes answer. 

It took 8 years stop thinking fault entirely dad dead. Per usual I'm going go grain one. People NJ couped since March. really ain't whole lot state going restaurant, bar, mall, retailer, place currently restricted. Even playgrounds taped off. ridiculous. watched protesters Philly, NYC, Trenton go problem. would anyone take seriously anymore. open outdoor dining people going go buck wild since March. open indoor dining people going go buck wile bar since March. open malls, people going go buck wild mall since March. Jersians go every week.

Eventually people get tired this. Jersians tend very... crude attitude towards told do. Eventually businesses open whether Murphy likes bills pay customers clamoring give money. Eventually people start parties residence. going do, call cops? bigger things worry right now.

If scared virus, stay home. vulnerable, stay home. feeling little weather, stay home.  eventually rest society going roll dice like every time set foot outside homes. heading grab mask remember still get shot, run over, fall, get food poisoning, killed cop, worst get stuck behind slow driver can't turn turn signal. Stay class NJ. *Twist*

p: *takes credit draining swamp* honestly concerned thought matter. There's pandemic spreading like wildfire China Europe, cure vaccine it....at point, temp travel ban everywhere affected makes sense spread point hospitals can't even handle people coming in. still remember Americans, even sub, cheered 'flattened curve' rushed reopen, US still thounds new cases every single day. proud. masks work China outbreak? People wearing masks China en masse many years, yet seem even slow spread. Wuhan one worst outbreaks all. can't find answer seemingly obvious question. Ok. Either way, still racist. 70% ICU beds generally use normally. That's hospitals for. China better SHUT. THIS. DOWN.

America going get point sick people can't cared it

Italy unfortunate pleasure hotspot early first wave extra capacity place developed countries San Bernardino county next zero testing appointments July 6th. called border cities LA county. thing. going keep numbers til least 4th due lack testing. knows many cases left unchecked walking around many open bars restaurants San Bernardino county. buffets open. aren’t supposed that! who’s stopping them? Ive reported multiple

Restaurants hiding cases employees health department unaware well. fucked even shut yesterday. fact every day going heads either sand asses haven’t made concerted effort stop this. Dam burst. Early Christmas! almost July, like get open one present Christmas Eve. exactly going happen, government nothing enforce this. bought steam games play never Doesn’t surprise me. grew Riverside idiots back then, too. price it’s cheaper die. wouldn't, much better strip clubs area. much lower 300 representative weekly average. 593 7-day average. I’m also fine accepting 5-10 year long recession/depression order save lives. 

You realize something: total federal income taxes 1.5 trillion. Everything. far year government injected 5 trillion economy. think pays that? kids grandkids.

How selfish us, mortgage kids future think acceptable risk zero-risk mommy daddy. low income families struggle feed children bigger impact article took social developmental stagnation. Children stay locked doors away friends long. isn’t healthy development socially receiving formal person education year certainly put behind, especially children critical points learning read. 

We’re putting generation school children behind that’s ok me. doctor Christ determines live die? Whaddup AZ? Galaxy brain *knew* going global pandemic would result 500k deaths 1st January. virus even sequenced.

Makes wonder genius like working public global health agencies since smart predict future flawlessly. true. live Ohio. Rural Ohio. governor great job, feel, handling pandemic. Yes, seeing spikes recently Cincinnati Cleveland. I'm happy living Ohio right now. Especially county, today 37 total cases (most better) 1 unfortunate death. look around small town, see people social distancing wearing masks. restaurants never open back dine in, still carryout drive thru only. One restaurant owner know said operating black carryout drive-thru. go effort hire staff open back dining room, shut couple months anyway. Makes sense... we're going shut again, think. percentage infected irreparable damage lungs nervous system? goo goo dolls right....broadway dark tonight.  Although people protest neighborhoods, many take subway get larger protests (relatively people cars, parking absolute nightmare anyway). think one factor probably help lot people attended protests NYC wore masks. People good masking general—in neighborhood Brooklyn, people wear even outdoors, *everyone* wears inside, least places go to. bf going meet sunday drive apartment. us quarantining parents time heading back apartment month two he's gonna join me. 

However, bf mentioned dad potentially showing symptoms. dad traveling Pennsylvania (Allentown) work NJ (we live NJ) dad mentioned cough felt feverish. said feels better he's staying attic away bf mom. 

If dad COVID boyfriend definitely exposed want bf anywhere around house parents grandmas home (all at-risk). Besides, probably apartment either put roomate risk, either guess.

I miss bf ton since spent quality time since March. safe see anymore? dad takes test comes negative would safe keep plans pick Sunday go apartment? 

Is chance dad could get false negative swab test? Like early tell even he's showing symptoms? 

Or best head alone give weeks wait out/see dad does? tragically make around 90-100k know minimum 10k-20k year goes healthcare. asked efforts involved vaccines. 6 efforts referring anyway? 6 efforts relating vaccines? efforts relating treatments? efforts related cures? specific. never wrote anything related conspiracy theories sure assume that. literally asked fuck else involved media making seem like go guy i've ever read monetary donations potential covid vaccine. conspiracy theorist insinuating enough? Ugh. What's girl gotta get viking send translations warm inbox? I’ll say, went thinking overhyped couldn’t possibly good, walked believing exceeded expectation. 

It’s damn good show. need blame anti-maskers too. government told us wear masks Hong Kong, still do.

They arseholes, stupid listen arseholes. [They're donating 940,000 vials free US government treating US $3k they're charging insurance, you. actually pay depends insurance plan. insurance, well fucked hospital bill regardless whether received remdesivir. hopefully got free 940k vials, plus it'll shorten hospital stay 30% save money way. GF nurse. get one mask per month lucky. young reduce chance experiencing symptoms, ability handle said symptoms? agree you. point college two choices:

1) strict social distancing online learning
Pro: good public health practice! 
Con: people pay college hemorrhage money

2) close campus person experience possible
Pro: best possible student retention reasons stated
Con: epidemic bait, may shut anyways 

IMO smartest thing college promise they’re in-person “normal” semester cancel go fully online people pay tuition 🙃 seems like already started. google search, find many famous statues states across world masks on.

You’re one literally ignoring facts. 

Why don’t go ask doctor it? Seriously, you’re media, go talk professionals.

You also realize business insider links sources, correct? read? ...pretty sure swine flu news happened.

Now help remember, COVID-19 outbreak?

""LOOK ME, I'M CYNICAL!"" really saying. Unless missed something, said “not recommending” them. reasoning first responders need limited supply existed didn’t want create panic/run masks (judging toilet paper thing played out, correct). Either way really screwed messaging that, question. get *accidentally* killing someone love still great mental health, right?

Edited add: like, reference, lost Dad high school. car crash, even there, feel responsibility whatsoever, I'm STILL dealing emotional fallout twenty years later. can't imagine bad would even accidentally responsible happened. think I'd ever recovered. Crisis care = legal protection triage. Triage = ""Allocation scarce resources patients based factors likelihood survival.""

Older individuals Arizona would well get sick right now. Gotcha, didnt mean personal responsibility traditional sense. idea that, unless locked houses, person truly keep safe virus yourself. Okay wont.

Who would downvote this? Lol.

Quick censor he’s starting sound like he’s telling truth! Stay afloat? said it’s airborne. think droplet would go past 6 feet?

If so, whole social distancing thing pointless also still inaccurate numbers due enough testing, based positive rates. room contagious person, currents air conditioning spread virus even much 6 feet away, illustrated we've doing.

You mean isolation. Yes isolated purified guess countries advanced biotech RNA sequenced publicly means RNA tested could come number sources, bacterial infection co-infection viruses.

Of course not. Viral RNa different bacterial. look bacteries databases. hugely important “positive” result serious consequences patients, non-viral factors excluded diagnosis

First, test works.

Secondly, factors course excluded. normal patient bave corona plus diseases. think corona patients multiple problems. Everyone puts mothers honestly, mothers every culture social class attentive towards kids.

That's get Fauci telling people wear masks.

then honest said that. they've got everyone still thinking masks work we're fucked. Wait, y'all elected black mayor? (Just saying based message good ole boys) never said COVID can’t transmit outdoors, please lump people do. I’m saying guess protests spreading disease less states’ I’ll-conceived reopening efforts. Nothing more, nothing less. believe data implies contrary, yet seen data you, anyone.

Thank detailed response knows high school math, he's much superior care mortal problems Agreed. Absolutely. America. stuff happen here. greatest country earth.

Their healthcare system sucks, best best world. one dying here, deaths plummeting. /s CDC lied said maks wern't effective started? [Make Warning: PDF

That's pattern mask that's least good N95 mask. Uses piece electrostatic HVAC filter filtering material. research? Google Scholar New York Post? Ya deaths even lagging indicator. Fl went overall average 1-2k new cases 5-9.5k span last 7 days. Thing is, week next week death #s following right behind. 

Even worse hospitals' situation. round one thing. seeing last week results knowing coming, know hospitals Fl Georgia (family er doc Atlanta) botch stocking supplies can, AND, EVERYTHING POWER clear many people hospital possible next week so. know important every bed be.

So ya, sorry think hope needs held back another 2 weeks. hope right worng, really really hope so...but I'm probably right given round 1 went. again, least Fl, first round 1-2k people confirmed. knows going go time? team scores points team basketball, team win game. Da bankahs!!?? Ah dyiaar! Af cooaahs wee cloap ath da bankahs! testing increases, testing mild cases. Cases people never going die anyways.  often teach child lock down?

Dogs cats living together! Yeah couple, wife ordered early like January something.

They awful wear. Hot uncomfortable. hate wearing mask is, N95 whole nother level annoying.

You want people wear masks, N95 gonna make people give whole thing Re-infection seem happening large scale, appear short-term immunity. 

Antibodies disappear time. people tested positive coronavirus negative serology test. cases, might see antibody response mild case. What's important T-cells immune system recognize coronavirus goes nostril creates antibodies needed needed. masks people buy even qualify surgical masks. experts ""planned"" people wear masks we'd lot better off. data issues yesterday.  Thankfully numbers lot worse. long way go start seeing trend heading right direction. Wish us luck! think droplets drop 90 degree angle second leave face? magically can’t stay afloat wind anything? Beverly Hills started giving tickets wearing mask. price goes repeat offenders. way. viral load theory relates amount virus initially exposed to, large viral load is. like you’re sitting enclosed room hour someone sick, initial viral load exposure high compared exposed virus mask ten minute conversation infected person. initial large viral load thought overwhelm immune system! banning straws, haha! much agita taking away people’s straws! comparison: peak, New Yorks daily cases per million people [509.4](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=states-normalized&amp;highlight=New%20York&amp;show=us-states&amp;y=both&amp;scale=linear&amp;data=cases-daily-7&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=right&amp;extra=#states-normalized).

""Viralists win"" position ""The things care important cancel due pandemic"" care hear say.

This group pediatricians saying ""In person school valuable completely give next year."" acting like they're saying ""I like golf, therefore golf courses open."" Sounds like “smoking area” used use work. inviting!  bullshit. believe told sky blue. 2 likely removed list. FL definitely ""outdoor lifestyle"" state aside tourists go beach. Also, summers outside basically limits masochists. first president told it. let’s go get inject bleach lungs Oh... joy... \**Scouter shatters* Well, I’m thinking almost get point. going run downtown LA yesterday suddenly felt short breathe exhausted, I’ve bed fever fatigue 26 hours. Pretty sure us expect happen us soon. Anyways, drink water sleep hope body beats is. WA. 

To give better picture: two counties worst numbers Washington State right Snohomish Yakima. first generally suburban area Seattle, thus considered Western Washington. second relatively well populated county near Cascades, considered Central Washington. One home office workers retirees, agricultural workers many blue collar occupations. Little common, superficial level. 

So hot spots state? boils this: local sheriffs record saying enforce social distancing protocols, new stay home order. Snohomish County Sheriff openly vocal there's effort recall election. Yakima sheriff stupid go record, local reporting suggests also done jack squat enforcing social distancing. complaints business owners fallen deaf ears. grandpa Mexican born, moved US young, studied became citizen. gets pension insurance too. first 5 children IIRC, born US too, live there. 

Don’t know exactly doctor since think it’s kind drag crossing border every often, grandma it. mean, it’s actually really easy people wear vent. get snooze tube lungs. What’s bad that?! spike caused actions 3-6 weeks prior. Odds we're seeing Memorial Day results, protest related spikes areas protests occurred curve flattening happened. Likely, based what's happened far, we'll see larger spikes originating protests ""waves"". 

Honestly, I'm really sure people think bad outbreak going different NYC Bergamo, Italy. exactly things ramped March, happening in:

Harris County, TX(Houston Metro)
LA County, CA (LA Metro)
San Diego County, CA (San Diego Metro)
Miami-Dade County, FL (Miami Metro)  shouldn’t censor discussion promote narrative. Look worked face masks. It’s newspaper’s fault idiots take wrong way. New York already one highest infection rates country far course numbers look bad, look around look timing surges, protests reopening, Georgia reopened month half spike week protests start spike spikes starts primarily among 18-29 age group age group protesting, bars reopening would effect age groups equally. Yeah, that's good point. I'm gonna start using reasoning justify prediction. Thanks! 

Florida also playing numbers. think hear Florida Texas much they're big states. bet fuckery Mississippi also. mean, good joke. nothing really happened January 2016. election November 2016 doofus sworn January 2017. US founded men willing die principles.

That's exactly opposite people willing die *and kill others* due inability go without luxuries short time. Maybe peacefully protest beach police enforce it. corrected many times, said response closing borders. Never called rednecks. called individuals act, specifically, stupid hicks.

Hick informally means ""rural-living person"", bigoted claim someone else's opinion stupid.

Perhaps Im over-generalizing assuming live rural conditions, I'm well within right call acts stupid. No, no. much testing. Yes. took kids bit adjust online learning, I'd much rather remain online classes skip semester time. could delay starting college semester tightly lock down, could mean year uncertainty opening/shutting repeatedly. I'd rather lose six months schooling year+. tell speak idea world. says it, might happen. :X know everyone going ""How possible open schools!?""  American Association Pediatrics say issue:  critical addressing racial social inequity.

That's terrible statement makes think taking coronavirus seriously. upset people also take seriously?

If position ""The things care important cancel due pandemic"" care hear say. \*Everyone\* thinks that.

They cancel schools reason enforce business closures : people going feel safe going work/sending kids school, deeply immoral force so. policy going ""School back kid want show to""? seems bad. going ""Everyone legally required come sit germ incubator"". That's also bad. 


I think reopening schools would deeply, deeply irresponsible reckless. think lot people worried protests, vocal it.

Now we're situation we're in, partially mass gathering. made lot good plans use them. I'd say like multimedia bath salts. Opening economy back instead cowering fear virus dangerous small portion population could *actually* save economy opposed pointless half measures nothing all. True - 94% also different 99%! haven’t seen yet logic like effect insane no-maskers. I've co-workers die.  None knew personally still sobering.  I've friends family get sick. really, mean really, sick 3 weeks month. serious.

At point everyone able understand serious is. major health issue quite possibly biggest historical event life. I'd call question character anyone take seriously. That's mad at. best current estimates experts actual IFR land somewhere .5% 1%. every American become infected would mean 1,650,000 3,300,000 deaths. Yet again, seeing issue people UNDERSTANDING equal sacrifice ... result ... treating angry getting stepped they're sort evil human.

I bet one people effected either, bet rolling along without care world. think America cost hospital stay would make everyone cautious. New Yorkers seeded nation coronavirus selfishly flew ""quarantine"" Miami Los Angeles. New Yorkers pulling draw bridge. Pulling protestors mask pepper spray also isn’t great idea. Translation = want constituents die. Biden looks bad ass mask. use ventilator sucks. Used one 6 days due severe pneumonia caused CRS. getting CAR-T Lymphoma. Almost kicked bucket. Florida 14% positive via testing? That's really bad considering people probably tested, large elderly population may end giving highest number deaths. Yup, US *has* trump countries. right say country. cells don’t make antibodies. You’re thinking B cells. Oh ok. really clear context.

I really take opinion doctor seriously unless they're specifically infectious disease expert. fact went talkshow little worrisome, though. wondering Sweden deaths Nordic countries: 
This data suggests people born outside Sweden granted citizenship likely infected coronavirus. 

This somewhere Sweden stands compared remaining Nordic countries. Unfortunately, COULD result authorities failed informed segregated society guidelines. 

There probably ton analysis couple months. think key-factor spread much Sweden. 

6 first 15 dead also Somali-Swedish. i- nearly reddit left that's Easy. reduce amount testing centers available, and/or reduce staff employed testing centers. long share air room, responsibility others room too. everyone willing share responsibility room except you, need responsible think being. Ik heb mistypt omdat ik op gsm bezig en m’n tekst niet na las.

There 30 thousand evangelicals Belgium. Exponential growth...take high school math class Go vegan left Trump going golfing. Yeah thinking that. opportunity kill oldsters ill, severely limit immigration, whoever’s left gets work jobs immigrants doing. slash minimum wage. given grant first place Imo, shit someone wearing mask part problem cause dig heals Aside verifiable nonsense he's spouting, take minute appreciate odd looks 'manual' clothes Swedish Defense Force crowing article meaning Sweden's corona crisis caused Denmark.

For real? None Sweden blames Denmark that... Maybe landlords get job Crazy part even 100k/day would take 13 years work entire population almost 7 years reach 60% heard immunity level. actually LA County Health fact say protests rallies contributed sharp rise, could quantify percent simultaneous re-opening walk-in retail &amp; dine-in service. Add fact families celebrating Memorial day, graduations &amp; Father's day extended relatives &amp; friends &amp; neighbors see rate accelerating. whole problem. nothing people wanting get friggin haircut mask on. reason became issue instead thousands people ready go crowd places masks soon could.

Almost whole misdirection intentional.. Damn Greenland Generally speaking, agree points. guess like defending caveats/asterisks/exceptions/explanations... 

For instance....what ""out about"" mean? practically speaking, matter term means, end day.  Members only. Teaching trump voters? 🤣 Feel free try. research analysis lot things, order better understand markets. key work descriptive, rather prescriptive--in words they're advocating one way another, stating facts. here. Hard keep balance healthy fear rightful optimism. business conducted US profits safety Curious - ""heat chamber"" separate location incineration? 

Or thing close doors vents normal habitat let suffocate choke heat CO2? Full lethality won’t get numbers win. get initial boost deaths, you’ll kill hosts contagion properly spreads. Sunday/monday/Tuesday always slow day Florida others pointed out. went mid 2,000s last week go mid 5000s week. know highs last week, week? 12k? 13k per day?

And people infected last week week before. 

Its scary. guess I'm cheap. Unless waitress blowing way hell I'm paying 40 percent tip. That's insane. mediocre burger watered soda refilled lucky. least something good comes pandemic then? foreign born people?  Redditor registers lowest number Sweden posts day. Deaths lagging indicator, death count peak mostly NYC. expect see death rates start skyrocket get another major city looks like NYC. (Which almost guarantee point.) gs recently invest mask tec Well convention certainly change risk level. Sounds like he's pretty exposed today. Whaaaat? Hahahahaha, would funny real. People actually need listen. Imagine administration actually listened took clear, decisive action. Fair enough. Essentially, sunlight helps reduce chance catching surfaces (which already believed low) direct person-to-person transmission still major risk. Someone else might think ""appropriate safety measures"" indoor dining, example. Others might view ""carry only."" Others might view ""the safety measures pre-COVID."" point is, saying ""appropriate safety measures"" means wildly different things different people. Depends country. think there, currently 14 15 countries allowed EU. Sure sure novel virus... objectively annoying breathe cloth covering nose mouth. I'll outside going life wearing muzzle millions others growing. can't deal stay inside That's literally city. Lots fenced areas outside bars (usually treeless, often concrete) people pay premium congregate, drink, play cornhole. someone spent time countries observed normal drinking cultures, baffles people would willingly subject degradation Lmao like realistic scenario actually Dogs bees mouths mix pretty sure large Latino population well. Yeah, lack safety net exactly it. Ultimately economy destroys itself. workers danger way protect system so.

Preserving economy is, keep f-ing us again. That's reopening preserve economy fails situation... well, ludicrous. That's can't wrap head around.

I keeping eye companies never support this. American people takes common sense precautions. sites around require doctor referral. schedule date time show up. 

Both restrictions lower number tests taken. also many swabs allocated facility day. Several facilities run swabs even though people wanted tests. makes worse. California bit state, slightly national average. Meaning smaller states larger number new cases proportional size. Two parties Arlanza neighborhood live last weekend. Meanwhile wife left house since early February leave work, get gas, refill water jugs. time read this, none left. still couple cassettes. know, usual - angry samoans, brujeria. Bin Laden won? I'm afraid so. mean said lot infectious diseases. Measles TB example. Literally 100% untrue. 

There several easily available, peer reviewed published studies verify effectiveness masks aerosols/airborne viruses wearer. 

Why would spread misinformation like this? Phoenix one (if *the*) least densely populated major cities country. Thank you. Water parks public pools never open. Period. 

Not water make mask wearing useless, nobody comes close actually socially distancing, especially children involved. wants survive. realize closed borders Europe first? really even know hell talking about? Ducey briefing 3p. new executive order China turned AC workplaces. even comment know talking about? nothing we're ideas Fatigue body aches symptom: Good luck. stuck forever. Yeah, health insurance. I'm really screwed get sick end needing medical intervention. Yes, and, truthfully, think ideally shut socially isolate there's far fewer active cases. worked literally rest world got onboard idea. Literally everywhere else capable utterly selfish.

We'd opening safely country self-entitled assholes, evidenced events like one. purely failure culture we're allergic momentary suffering can't stay inside measly months prevent otherwise inevitable catastrophe. 

And failure government interests wealthy mind; would paid us $2,000.00 per month stay home, ""gotta get back work"" argument held water. people would gotten used getting paid living wage spending every waking ounce energy grinding lives away, lucky break even. spending little free money self-medicate vices.

But I'm trying roll reality rather rage it, suggested something least help mitigate risk. Every person see working service industry 40 can’t blame partying. people forced make living serving eggs Karen pandemic. Except great number people demonstrate zero intuitive common sense prefer parrot whatever misinformation told week week.

Which get people screeching loudly ""masks protect others!!"" wonder what's going behind closed doors GOP leaders 180. 

It's nice, obviously care. realise killing base? distract Russia news? Wonder real sudden shift tone is... Sure winter break? Bill Gates says population US much dumber anticipated. FTFY. scale action impact scale decades, MAYBE.

Which added detriment seen ""someone me"". right kills lot folks. ... literally never happen virus isn’t sentient. doesn’t want anything.

Also, FYI - edited titles allowed sub likely get removed.

The Coronavirus Much Worse Think
How COVID-19 infecting minds, lungs.
Posted Feb 27, 2020 Yeah guy looked eclipse right? Wow telling come family celebrate kids turning 18 kick out? Nice ass numbers. described sex too. Getting worked possible, sweaty sharing cookies after.  Year round school actually pretty awesome. kid. Would solve types issues. Yes, maybe also start teaching people school cough shirts sneeze covering mouths. Maybe wash hands. Idk, take care personal hygiene. fucks sake reason masks mandated fact people cover fucking mouths talk there's nothing talk about. Oh heartbreaking. usa 288 deaths yesterday isnt absurdly low number? early! Summar getting started July wife isn’t going back. I’d encourage wife same. get ticket think ""So-Cal"" useful all. think LA San Bernardino County lumped together all. San Diego LA much common San Diego San Bernardino, example. Wow got fatter. Wonder kids are. \*laughs BJJ\* saw times Wuhan among health care workers die unexpectedly.

This exactly think happening. still nice Fourth July. Bbq, fireworks, swimming. anyone KS problem this, remind Spanish Flu fault big chance redemption. fuck Kansas. provide protection groups keeping stuff in. want proper protection others wearing masks need high grade fitted mask. Hahahhaha get intoxicated already? Lol That’s wanted It’s unknown course pro micro chip phony says get vaccine. Everyone believe man! fever I'd monitor argument ""keeping healthy essential life outlook long term health"", really need listen stay gym. get 2 lungs...thats it. damaged, coming back. 

If exercise keeps suicidal depression now....imagine life permanent respiratory deficit. shit straight make want eat bullet. 

There plenty one do. guarantee matter shredded think right now...there someone else world would put shame - done body weight exercise cardio shit. 

Even 95% people this, mild case - remaining 5% stupid large reckless roll dice lifelong health. extent Mr. Gates taken secondary focus career tech, public health. consider second career. He's dumb math he's dumb systems; Fauci would probably tell listen Fauci him, anyway. Thus Mr. Gates demonstrable restraint even endorsement comments sorely lacking LESS intelligent, yet self-assured contributors (who people listening gusto). 

Further resources rival small nation, make significant beneficial contribution effort (and fact so). Thus, WOULDNT listen Bill Gates this? He's actually paying attention something, he's even calling expert.

If dilute bloviations people like Elon Musk topic, glad Bill Gates speaking up. like lifting coach always screamed: “THE GYM GAINZ” like elementary school. expected allowed travel certain European countries without spend 14 days quarantine thought include Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Turkey, Germany Norway - Portugal Sweden.

So understand what's gone wrong Sweden, facile knowledge Portugal got bad. source bunch fucking morons going without masks. Ok virgin Great, another parrot.

Masks provide two-way protection. Full stop.

They *better* preventing sneeze spit droplets entering air affecting others, absolutely provide measure protection breathing well, same.

The real danger masks pass candle test... (If blow candle mask one inch away, terrible mask) - protect anybody.

Still stupid fuck go gym respiratory exhalation happening far rapidly enclosed space... let's try demonstrate least little bit common sense making statements things since amended accurate know there's Karen getting revved right now. Hmm, let guess. Alt-Christian, anti-masker, male, fat, white old. 

I can't even make joke predictable. weeeeeeeee Ugh god, wish Facebook would die. practically unregulated utility. Yes. Deaths lag well. find end result soon enough though. really hope less vulnerable age group. want mess blood clots though. recession every 10 years it’s bs headline [KC Star article](http://archive.vn/ON3Nd) boat.

I never convinced single case secondary infection. There's much evidence virus lingers long patient tests negative. Young people fastest growing infections SC getting hopes responsibility make decisions best interests public’s health safety called upon. 

I don’t want dystopian economic crisis work hospital. see people die alone, someone holds device talk someone love one last time, breathing tube, makes real scary. 

I want appropriate prophylactic measures don’t go full scale raging viral crisis again. IfDeSantis hadnt arrogant, Florida may better chance preventing this. Let us go college away grandma eat campus Great, we've listened everything else said far. How's going? Yes, will. I’m going pretend lot friends means (I’m Reddit), I’ve posting social media accounts importance wearing mask since March. Every time someone announced social media didn’t believe virus dies virus, post story. try delicately calmly explain helpful people message with, “do really need wear mask though?” don’t think convinced single one them. week goes by, someone COVID positive comes bubble right back square 1.

You can't forever. endless cycle 7 billion people catch thing Get tucs butthurt, brah 🙄 much time have? see gym (somewhere America, major city) put protective tents around treadmills weight sections stuff? Social distancing tents. They're literal petri dishes first two people use them, yuck. find article, really ridiculous. could be...

Regardless, say genetic racial trait. said national distinction. part article relevant now? We're exactly virus wants. millions years. either playing game wrote rules. 16 years finding decisions dumb drunk, decided quit researching Wtf. Murphy needs shut shit right fuck down.

I’d like see Cleveland’s public numbers Memorial Day gatherings well, channel I’ve following that’s spot beginning stated there’s going spike protests, it’ll really start showing week second week July. 

Data data data. Cleveland mass outdoor gatherings? Specifically partying Memorial Day? And? Healthcare workers work sick damn time. last number saw 87% ICU beds use, think last Thursday. There's shuttered hospital planned opening use overflow, though I'm unsure opened yet. expect. precisely privatized healthcare never good idea. There’s alternatives find cost new car expensive, phone plan expensive. alternative death, you’ve got choice pay demand. Fucking outrageous. wear masks Dumbest state America.

Inside far spill-over patios. I've collecting many hours collect stimulus checks, making money. Unreal. LA's cases climbing but... like this. we're packed like sardines comparison. soon find vaccine better smash ""sell all"" button. JFC asshats idiots. studies outside US showing masks work, wearing one since February. government lied played politics hatred nobody wore mask - govt said to.

Oh, social distancing - ok, going wear mask, good enough.

Fast forward, everyone requires masks, people smirked wearing one March, calling people murders - well, fine.

But stand outside sun get stores idiots understand social distance everyone wearing mask. And. worse yet, can't go gym, months, idiotic leaders realizing wearing masks along.

What bunch fucking idiots. requirement intellect cucumber get politics?

edit: identify political parties independent; anyone ever doubts, moronic handling situation idiotic governer proof reelected. plays politics ignores facts, fucking whole situation way beyond needs took steady, intelligent approach problem. FFS!!! hope vaccine going down? There's numerous top experts confident china started using vaccine soldiers (seems stupid whatever). Fauci even said get vaccine. infringement freedom cant breathe. Aaargggg remember generation also needs live long term consequences this. majority Baby Boomers gone 30 years, generation. soooo live caribbean country...we opened borders international travel (incl.

i fear we're ""couldve handled health wise gave country would collapse economy wise"" Americans: lock bullshit infringes rights. 


Rest intelligent world: mean already beat yet? open Morons. Oh btw allowed travel here.


Education obviously issue America Churches always exempt rules. entire point Christian exempt punishment Sin Jesus punished you. thing churches do, DNA belief system right one core thing believe believe nothing else.

TLDR: exemption rules consequences thereof *the* paramount Christian doctrine. ignorant, uninformed comment here.... Stockholm already herd immunity. test trace isolate always pipeline. tests available scale, spread less enough actually try trace. Guess Chicago new hot spot couple weeks. McSally's seat, upcoming election, reelection 2026, Sinema elected 2018, reelection 2024. Sodium chloride (salt) strong antimicrobial sweat issue. hope every state ticket every person wear mask. Use income tickets fund testing/contact tracing. Win win. Oh yeah get it. 

Most days I’m like “oh shit that’s many cases” check test number it’s new record day testing. positive percent rate steady. positive percentage rate tick 5% today it’s awhile. hospitalizations also declining too. think around 500 covid patients PA right pretty good. 

But agree. can’t get complacent. go store early buy high demand items, use curbside buy things likely run out. back people shopping like crazy eventually able buy everything curbside again. Although think shopping frenzy going pick back up. Anecdotes prove severity. It’s smear makeup attended public magnet school know full well important mentors school. immigrant parents much help. kids know anything. 

I struggled college excelled high school. struggled get first job college. wish knew college steps needed take get good job gate, instead stumbled good guidance learn own. Sure graduated gainfully employed mentorship (from parents adult figure) important children teenagers learn mistakes successful gate whatever do. 

I wished better mentors high school. Bringing back context coronavirus, longer kids school, worse going be, especially kids decide go college later on. studied business, pretty easy given spectrum subjects available study college, imagine tried engineering science. would screwed. 

My hometown newspaper great education section one article compared one group valedictorians inner city compared another group valedictorians suburbs - valedictorians suburbs successful ten years on, quite valedictorians inner city flunk college stuck driving Uber working menial jobs.  restaurants near open like 2 weeks nowhere near capacity. They’re going go business soon, way around it. Likewise bars weren’t operating like used - sitting table plastic walls each. Yes! clay resident wish would. masking since day one expense dirty looks, back handed comments literally called idiot wearing mask went pay gas. know, gas stations petri dishes already! much ignorance :( commenting needing get life commenting isn't? mean look leadership place Bill...you people should’ve seen coming opposed “who could seen coming”

When global health issue gets highly politicized it’s going end well said population. like believe we’re way better we’ve shown, weak leadership ignoring science 100% what’s made bad States. likely go completely business unlike restaurants cant likely turn even take survive. death business money invested it. tough rational lose everything today, brother. it’s term someone Downs shape eyes person Downs. eyes “mongoloid”. contrary, appears China actually indefinite future. 

* China effectively eradicated disease domestically,
* China quarantine control borders,
* China manages contains outbreaks still small.

New Zealand Asian countries similarly. 

This 4th 5th little outbreak, appears they're getting good managing them. 

Yes, surprises possible, frozen seafood thing, something would completely overlooked America, America anywhere near ability trace outbreak like China did. China reacted well, that's keeping things getting control. death lags behind 4-6 weeks right? next months going horrifying. time. country needs plan. Closing, reopening, locking every 2 months shit hits fan isn’t plan. wife called month ago, states would start closing again. 

People need stop fucking stupid. Wear damn mask, wash hands, follow rules children easily follow. hard. mean, really want dad die something preventable, he's going refuse expert advice claim one big ""democratic hoax"", funeral's gonna sad be. Yes, everyone visited grocery stores past 3 months dead today. Really helped food shortages. live shithole country .. cost $0 Geez, wonder started that? Man arguing straw man easy ain't it.

1. Riots ok.
2. Protesters wear masks. Nobody said shouldn't.
3. Yes, important protest systemic oppression get beer bar. Fucking obviously.  Restaurants shouldn’t open all. Full stop. 5.5 8 million people. realize 2.7 3 million Americans die every year. people calling nonsense question. money

Ill gotten goods. give away shit wife made him. That’s I’m saying statement makes sense coming scientist. And? New York City, people LA, protests going down. Everything I've seen curves positive cases deaths (or hospitalizations matter) weakly correlated. follow data, period. Early on, meant slow learn more. Now, pretty clear vast, vast majority people severely affected, regardless many tests positive.

I live Midwest. have, seriousness, going lives nothing changed six weeks. cases dropping. Aside isolated flares, like meat packing plants, really affecting us much all, health wise least. Ppl stocks? Lol NHS gonna bulk order cost production plz. Priced based effectiveness? That's insane, costs know need basically. Cost produce matter kind world saving drug. support extrajudicial murder? No, idiots bars restaurants without masks on. I’m teacher AZ - much apprehension coming year. heart breaks students. making alternative plans hybrid half-in-person/half-online curriculum months now. Given students *something*. Instead, delays, lost teaching time. school district encouraged contingency planning, without set guidelines cannot utilize time fully.

We knew would like this. Models predicted back March. surprises except foolish people been. still prepared? Since Trump certain hot weather kills virus, perhaps move RNC future stomping grounds ... Hell. really worry it. There's number reasons temp might elevated little used (though 99.3 still normal range). I'd keep eye turn fever call doctor go get tested. I’m starting feel disheartened. hope actual vaccine becoming less less. don’t coronavirus vaccine yet. Upper respiratory tough protect. really don’t think going away anytime soon - living disease get it, that, knows. teacher fear going back school. end times? Please - thoughts get this, I’d love hear them. think I’ve hit wall optimistic rational last months. second infection - one. well documented small number cases - get it, feel bad, feel better, feel like SHIT. A) probably beneficial. B) costly imagine. Simply realistic. 2 liter POP then, jeeze! think person saying already fit people CrossFit games competitive purposes. AAAYYYY, OHHHHHH, AYYYYY, OHHHH, WHADDA WIT DA CORONA VIRUS UH JERSEY UHMERICA AAAYYYYY


gg Headline-only readers beware: article primarily Middle East North Africa, one example Mexico. people protesting wore masks attempted distance. police violence way spread disease. IL pretty good blew Thanks mr president kidding me? 90% posts thread purely political. Right?

I'm voting fucking dog never let down. would like hear thoughts things. trying chip info gather said chip? Purely location benefit? sell things something devious? lol, 100 degrees outside humid. Wait... normal mask can’t filter covid-19 reduce spread. she’s basically protecting others way.

Yes, believe everyone wearing mask mask protect others yourself. long NY bad places, reason think it. Interesting logic. tipping thing important. I’ve tried double usual tip eating out. eat far less situation extra bucks tip isn’t big deal. Probably cringing CrossFit stopped reading first paragraph said created* response countries using. Including responses states. 

Lmfao.

I’m kidding haven’t read past much wrong first paragraph. It’s worth reading rest.

Edit: typo Man, guy aged like crazy last months. can’t even imagine burden must cary Wrong answer. Perd Hapley grow mustache? also counting 10x CDC claimed?

And tbh, 36k death is.... tragic, pretty low population China. guess confirms pathetic response whole thing is, (120,000/36,000)x(1,300,000,000/350,000,000)=12X! know protests caused infections? Minnesota's early testing showed .98% infection rate: protests taught us virus spreads. believe known clusters breakouts track back indoor events, interactions. 

&amp;#x200B;

And read article, anecdotal story cited could infection protest -- 

""“I actually got sick day march,” said Turner. “I could move bed. bed sighing.” According Turner, several friends march also tested positive Coronavirus. Turner says wearing masks.""

\-- would presenting symptoms day exposure, that's impossible. Clearly getting together ""several friends"" also apparently infected. pretty obvious got infected prior march, thank goodness wore masks, hopefully pass infection beyond circle. 


Other patented ""Fox News Blame BLM Everything"" headline, single word article supports implication outdoor protests contributed increase cases. Ok, thanks follow up. could ~~save~~ kill economy! vaccines keep developed, mean time.

Are sure? behavior would like happen way things panning out, companies could willing drop developing potentially better vaccines look profitable. decent number hospitals Corpus city size. they're reaching capacity good region. Yea, testing sites around Tampa either running tests around 8am daily basis testing availability next week.  would guess population density 28,491 inhabitants per square mile NYC compared 353 per square mile state FL. travel helping spread virus, large part population taking public transit. Seems like lot factors helped spread quickly. Profits? major airline see profit awhile. Certainly year. airlines trying stay intact operating maybe bankruptcy court demand picks up. 

If flying feels dangerous, don’t it. don’t blame airlines taking steps remain business people willing go. Things like insurance issue here. long short (i understand working ambulance explained me, billing system hospital) insurance willing to.pay much drug charge much. hospital, since many people skip bills, use one vial box drugs (or one bandaid box, one nasal canulla, iv bag etc) charge whlle box. *rioting right anything yet? bodies streets people still claiming “sheeple” pointing uptrend shown still net decline. 300 deaths incredibly low. 2000 one point April. Get cause effect. I’m american, don’t take kindly logic suppose think black peoples forgotten place America too. honest believe known virus led believe. common sense wearing even simple piece cloth face covers nose mouth example. something observed countries far East. 

But noooo! mistaken notion American exceptionalism put hundreds thousands people risk illness. 

You got people letting restrictions supposedly congratulating front line people. ask yourself....How many people saying ""go team go! "" willing put lives line fellow countrymen?

Think it. Congress go vacation middle unprecedented disaster. tells feel us. 

Yeah that's right! Hold second stimulus check argue amongst one another like bunch kindergartners. People suffering hospitals barely clinging life others concerned losing homes yet worried stupid vacations.

Gimme break! thousands experts wptking him. 

Plus he's donating money medical organizations experts actually make vaccine, himself. Comparing densities San Francisco NYC hilarious. Yeah, Fauci right abo - ... Oh, right. every damn time. likely, vaccine going turn public expects be. Vaccines almost never work 100%, considerable differences efficiency among different age groups.
 
There many differences among different vaccines. Efficiency percentages differ, target age groups differ, safety profiles, side-effects, need booster doses, injection vs. oral/nasal routes, cold-chain room temperature storage, ease production, cost production etc.
Oxford vaccine may fail, something gives 30% protection 6 months, prevent disease spread prevents serious complications etc. moment vaccine + covid exposure case anything possible.

If turns amazing vaccine, efforts, especially ones strong funding likely continue. also important consider novel technologies great potential, mRNA vaccines. I'm pretty sure going continue matter what, many enough funding researchers, governments pharma companies want know novel technologies applicable. 

The important thing eventually come something works efficiently enough. Crossing fingers, may take long time. Reading comments make head spin. professionals actually dealing issue day day basis still answers makes think people going to. Opinions like facts Pseudo date dangerous. 

Please careful information read here. Listen actual professions. Ah. idea try infect...not actually infect.

Don't know read wanting infect people trial...which point make sense vaccine. question this. People often say even get vaccine won’t available majority people US. getting 300 million doses would cover majority people? Wonder fact lots people wearing... masks. Huh. Seems like nationwide science experiment prove masks make massive difference. Weird.  Thank Meatloaf! ""We first though. First!

Tremendous!"" likely change... Me, me, me.  bet this? Stay strong, Cincy! We're thinking Columbus :) Knowing someone went high school great aunt havent seen decade wont affect them. don’t care End July everyone nothing.

However state governors starting reimpose pretty lax lockdowns, slow progress towards 100k maybe give time control 100k (say peak 80k per day). 

Of course, relies proper testing, US still got handle on.

I'm coming conclusion really addressed till Jan 2021 new administration. point could looking 1m deaths. Yep rural America ""real America"" many eyes even though full worst people. remdesivir, dexamethasone, higher ICU capacity ventilator numbers, age adjusted death rate US substantially lower compared start pandemic. trust Florida’s data? sound comcastic! lockdown lead flattened curve. leads interrupted curve. 

I'm placing value one strategy comment - I'm factually pointing everywhere else Europe steeper decline, regardless high respective peak was. venn diagram people angry BLM spreading Covid people supported Reopen protestors circle. hard truth. real prevention would close restaurants outbreak control enough proper contact tracing.

Masks eating inherently compatible. Let's embrace pickup delivery support local restaurants. Yes, take advice guy thousands doctors working him, hasan IQ around 168, warning whole eorld possible pandemic past ~10 years. 

 Instead, take random advice u/Johnchuk, public medical degree affiliation. 


What? course person medical affiliation trust worthy billionaire thousands doctors working him! mind? Bill Gates wants give us chips via. unexistsnt vaccine! /s

*what's U.S. even higher cases previous peak?* could say definitively, bother whole trials thing? Fauci many things, fortune teller /oracle delphi among them. live America. I've wearing mask, staying home part, social distancing public. upsetting people refuse wear masks avoid crowded bars make entire US sound retarded. countries pointing fingers us laughing.  Holy Water? Nope.  one party lockstep regarding failure properly protect US. sides same.  Take lie elsewhere That's crazy part though! Even breathing issue, that's reason staying wearing masks virus. 

My mask gives trouble hot days asthma, that's reminder definitely want catch go ventilator! plague rats know wrong thing, insist anyway.

Why? Good. Please explain who's full shit? mean, likely not. Let’s real

And one guy idiot doesn’t discount actions opponents it? Deaths lag infections weeks. Ohio deaths per capita Florida, Texas, Arizona, per worldometers, Ohio seems poorly, actually. It’s depressing watching people this.

My husband got ridiculously enormous TV. Like it’s biggest TV. whatever, really likes it. last night inaugural viewing session watched Planet Netflix. love documentaries one series focused large ecosystems- deserts, forests, ocean.

Near end beautiful drone footage blue whale 6-ton baby 4 weeks. narrator informing us much people destroyed oceans turn destroys glaciers destroys climate. 

I woke dog yelling “David Attenborough save oceans! can’t even save ourselves!”

I try find optimism hope really don’t know. protests weeks ago though. story UK, uptick following protests. Outdoor transmission significantly lower indoor. believe combination above. Viruses mutate become weaker time, vulnerable populations nursing homes already ravaged, improving treatment doctors nurses learn approach disease. Hopefully death numbers stay lower side; scary case numbers risen past weeks - next weeks telling happen death rate, ends mirroring increase we've seen increasing somewhat still staying lower rate we've seen past. Yes. Yeah, actually polite putting ""some."" probably ""most"" ""all."" Surprise! Fox News.  whenever see people refusing wear masks, wonder many bad decisions make life.

These probably people swerve across three lanes highway make exit miss. Unfortunately true, contact tracing labour intensive many cases exposures... really doable without phone tracking computers. Fairly healthy? seen obese football players are? history concussions god know else. *extinction 

/s hopefully many businesses also dangerous in, bars extreme level danger.

Aside obvious lack social distancing minimal mask useage, pool tables, dart boards, beer pong tables people touching objects &amp; over. 

There's simply way keep bars safe without destroying profit margins. Bar owners basically screwed certainly better global population screwed.... Better prepare news wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong remember people trying downplay numbers comparing current 1 month amount deaths annual death rates, anyone see going experience exponential rise numbers.

The stupid burns. ""here's bill, good luck paying it"" shitty country resources leave shit hole yet. Fortunately I'm California surrounded bunch racist pigs. Even patients didn’t develop antibodies, probably developed specialized cells. study accurate, it’s possible way people immunity think. drugs like insulin?

Created 100 years ago diabetes treatment, passed sort FDA blessing long ago

Not created developed US

Some countries offer free 

US charges exponentially country suddenly grave understanding

Excellent choice wording. part past months wearing masks trying gradually open not, it’s easy us it’s irritating, necessary. 120 icu cases state according dash board today. I’ve saying get go thank god live state actual uses science intellect. Seems saying large amount people exposed coronavirus potentially immune result show antibody tests we've using determine general exposure level population, we've underestimating general exposure based tests. positive takeaway may closer herd immunity think. Bbbuuutttt mmmooonnneeyyyyyyy!!!!! ya'll realize exact logic ""the side"" got done using say reopening cause uptick? probably best wait weeks declaring victory since ended egg face pretty quick still waiting crisis contracts.. added [asterisk Sweden's entry information based data reported previous two weeks. past two days [as 27 June] decline number new confirmed cases Sweden. case fatality rate declining consistently, well absolute number deaths.

One Sweden's objections basically boiled ""I want go cart! I'm getting better!"" like ""ok... kinda, guess, really"". 

[This bit Tegnell's criticism, sent press release Friday afternoon tone Sweden significantly mitigated. organization acknowledged increased testing reflected number new confirmed cases. 

 important note proportion positive results among tested stable around 12 13 percent. indicates Sweden still social spread,"" spokesperson highlighted declining number new deaths new cases severe covid-19 disease ""very positive"" trends able keep spread infection levels managed Swedish health care,"" stated press release Friday press release, clarify whether Sweden removed list evening, long series calls TT, organization confirmed Sweden remains situation changed,"" writes Stephanie Brickman WHO's press service email TT. guess fair increased testing play role, quite bad looks paper take account. Still, stability positive % telling. think also acting diplomatically since Sweden *incredibly* upset inclusion list developed country said list. also noted that, example, Kazakhstan actually tests Sweden currently. Kazakhstan #33 tests per million Sweden #57 currently:  read whole exchange completely understand agree point view, hivemind downvoters damned. went protest roughly 1,000. Everyone wearing mask. Maybe everyone gather masses, there's cure!  people country laughing asymptomatic people getting caught tests ""see, hoax, even symptoms"". Jesus, hope explode faces, quite low stable numbers - thanks quick lockdown masks - chaos testing quarantine. Test results get lost, swabs appently arrive wet ice kept melted flooded everything, swabs arrive without readable information belong to, people quarantine checked on, one responds calls... Good cheaper lookout stop small flares, thousands deaths countries close border you.

And economy punching bag 4 months now. weird. enacting law! live Maryland we've going 2 months (guessing, can't remember sure). many people bothered wearing masks Covid numbers fairly low (relatively speaking). Employee NH club. reprimanded couple times enforcing state guidelines. ""Don't want come across police officer"" I've told. I'm handing notice sending state nice letter find another job. omg back huh? god feel sorry whoever significant other, even one those. yeesh Whether it’s dye whole premise ID2020 identify everyone vaccinations right? prioritize based survival chances. three weeks ago low point cases, hmm, thank proving death rates today near low point. ""One day, just... go away"".

""We're almost zero"". don’t know believe more. sure things? please share. There’s much right find funny people sure things. 

I believe keeping tabs things suspect patiently watching unfold. ever elusive truth may never known, pay attention happens us. also believe cautious, that’s I’m doing, throwing caution wind want keep tabs things like myself. federal bill passed signed law (must wear masks) would give police power fine/arrest, would result civil rights argument? tldr would interpret statement, read set pragmatic suggestions going work conditions meet control recommendations anyway - appreciate bringing attention, please accept up-vote.

Critical shortages personal protective equipment (PPE) resulted US Centers Disease Control downgrading recommendations health workers treating COVID-19 patients respirators surgical masks finally home-made cloth masks. authors published randomised controlled clinical trial cloth masks, getting daily emails health workers concerned using cloth masks. study found cloth mask wearers higher rates infection even standard practice control group health workers, filtration provided cloth masks poor compared surgical masks. time study, little work done space, little thought improve protective value cloth masks. now, guidelines PPE even mention cloth masks, despite many health workers Asia using them.

Health workers asking us wear mask cloth masks option. research condone health workers working unprotected. recommend health workers work COVID-19 pandemic without respiratory protection matter work health safety. addition, health workers get infected, high rates staff absenteeism illness may also affect health system capacity respond. health workers may still choose work inadequate PPE. case, physical barrier provided cloth mask may afford protection, likely much less surgical mask respirator.

It important note subjects control arm wore surgical masks, could explain cloth masks performed poorly compared control group. also analysis mask wearers, higher infection rate cloth mask group persisted. cloth masks may worse study washed well enough – may become damp contaminated. cloth masks used study products manufactured locally, fabrics vary quality. limitations also discussed.

There numerous reports health workers wearing home made cloth masks, re-using disposable mask respirators, asking guidance. health workers choose work circumstances, guidance given around use.

There number laboratory studies looking effectiveness different types cloth materials, single versus multiple layers role filters play. However, none tested clinical trial efficacy. health workers choose work using cloth masks, suggest least two cycle them, one washed dried daily use. Sanitizer spray UV disinfection boxes used clean breaks single day. pragmatic, rather evidence-based suggestions, given situation.

Finally COVID-19, wearing mask enough protect healthcare workers – use gloves goggles also required minimum, SARS-CoV-2 may infect respiratory route, also contact contaminated surfaces self-contamination.

Governments hospitals plan stockpile proper disposable products respirators surgical masks ensure occupational health safety health workers. appears failure many countries, including high income countries.

As long industries humans animals continue interact, risk another pandemic causing zonotic diseases always presents. Anyway, disease surveillance programs exist, total fault one country race, responsibilities also collectively us. next pandemic disease would always come China.

Greetings best wishes Michigan, USA. Ok. could cut 4% US death rate would saved 4,000 lives far.

if cut hospital time 25% would kept NYC hospitals overwhelmed. 

i'd say well worth it, assuming larger scale studies bear out. profiting lmao, he's sinking money like mad **donations independent researchers lining up, won’t cause ruckus. patient.

Why patient conspiracy theory 'what ifs' actually something 'what if' about? fearmongering something reality. 

Who knows, might reality. personally doubt it, sure, could become reality. could understand fearmongering. 

Now spreading fear misinformation of...well something, least based facts. Entering July 2020 enough testing capacity though...

The positivity rate tests skyrocket cannot expand thejr testing anymore Can't compare. still vastly done flu. closed universities, amusement parks, large gatherings like sports big concerts. 

Flu epidemics give 2K deaths memory. Certain counties across us too. Florida actually state law wearing masks public county starting mandatory mask ordinance first well. Yeah, know that, lastly EVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME China. Also, I'd want return live normal life coronavirus pandemic worry two three months idiot piece shit putting everything rug. Well, happy note excess deaths Sweden anymore, then. current deaths track expected deaths time year. point arguing people couldn’t/wouldn’t spend time outdoors anyway... area continuously inhabited long time indigenous people inhabited area colonization exception. built dwellings. need shelter 110 degree heat. probably COVID-19 spreading like mad - it’s hot stay outdoors people seek refuge inside AC. dont allow UScitizens travel anywhere world rest world fine.

Yeah, everything closed except grocery stores farmacies. public transport restricted 1 person per double seat. still applies. curfew, strongly recommended stay within municipality people broke guidelines restriction could implemented. based trust see people behaved. think OK. I'm Swedish, right among worst NY could walk dozen different locations get tested. even think rules get tested more. say protesting. Yall still got rules allowed get tested? Haha, thing happened me. warning people since February coworkers rolled eyes me. I’m person come information questions, several also like “you called it!”

**COVID-19 PCR Tests Scientifically Meaningless.** Though whole world relies RT-PCR “diagnose” Sars-Cov-2 infection, fit purpose.

Kary Mullis invented Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology. invention got Nobel prize chemistry 1993. Unfortunately, Mullis passed away last year age 74, inventor regarded PCR innapropriate detect viral infection. reason intended use PCR was, still is, apply manufacturing technique, able replicate DNA sequences millions billions times, diagnostic tool detect viruses.

Moreover, worth mentioning **the PCR tests used identify COVID-19 patients presumably infected called SARS-CoV-2 valid gold standard compare with.**

**This fundamental point.** Tests need evaluated determine preciseness — strictly speaking “sensitivity” “specificity” — comparison “gold standard,” meaning accurate method available.

As example, pregnancy test gold standard would pregnancy itself. Australian infectious diseases specialist Sanjaya Senanayake, example, stated [ABC TV answer question “How accurate \[COVID-19\] testing?”:

If new test picking \[the bacterium\] golden staph blood, we’ve already got blood cultures, that’s gold standard we’ve using decades, could match new test that. COVID-19 don’t gold standard test.”

Jessica C. Watson Bristol University confirms this. paper [“Interpreting COVID-19 test published recently British Medical Journal, writes “lack clear-cut ‘gold-standard’ COVID-19 testing.”

But instead classifying tests unsuitable SARS-CoV-2 detection COVID-19 diagnosis, instead pointing virus, proven isolation purification, solid gold standard, Watson claims seriousness that, “pragmatically” COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, “may best available ‘gold standard’.” scientifically sound.

***Apart fact downright absurd take PCR test part gold standard evaluate PCR test, distinctive specific symptoms COVID-19.***.

And distinctive specific symptoms COVID-19, COVID-19 diagnosis — contrary Watson’s statement — cannot suitable serving valid gold standard.

In addition, “experts” Watson overlook fact virus isolation, i.e. unequivocal virus proof, gold standard.

Now question is: required first virus isolation/proof? need know RNA PCR tests calibrated comes from.

**Particle purification** — i.e. separation object everything else object, instance Nobel laureate Marie Curie purified 100 mg radium chloride 1898 extracting tons pitchblende — ***is essential pre-requisite proving existence virus, thus prove RNA particle question comes new virus.***

The reason PCR extremely sensitive, means detect even smallest pieces DNA RNA — cannot determine particles came from. determined beforehand.

And PCR tests calibrated gene sequences (in case RNA sequences SARS-CoV-2 believed RNA virus), know gene snippets part looked-for virus. know that, correct isolation purification presumed virus executed.

The authors four principal, early 2020 papers claiming discovery new coronavirus concede proof origin virus genome viral-like particles cellular debris, pure impure, particles kind. ***In words, existence SARS-CoV-2 RNA based faith, fact***.

This actually means one cannot conclude RNA gene sequences, scientists took tissue samples prepared mentioned vitro trials PCR tests finally “calibrated,” belong specific virus — case SARS-CoV-2.

In addition, ***there scientific proof RNA sequences causative agent called COVID-19.***

In order establish causal connection, one way other, i.e. beyond virus isolation purification, would absolutely necessary carry experiment satisfies four Koch’s postulates. experiment.

In words, even theoretically assume PCR tests really detect viral infection, tests would practically worthless, would cause unfounded scare among “positive” people tested.

In [“CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic file March 30, 2020, example, says:

Detection viral RNA may indicate presence infectious virus 2019-nCoV causative agent clinical symptoms”

And:

And the[ FDA admits results \[…\] rule bacterial infection co-infection viruses. agent detected may definite cause disease.”*** turned Libya slave state started genocide Yemen


Thats 2 things Trump 
Also forget promised close gitmo lose, lose. Like climate change. people wear masks eat? mandated nationwide You’re likely downvoted “very similar HIV” means nothing. similar it? way spreads? way attacks immune system? way body’s a
immune system responds? responds treatment? They’re getting nukes ready take hurricanes. sister lives now. attitude masks evil communist propaganda, seems lot local agreement attitude. Though I'm sure enclaves reasonable people, often find Bend. NY UK both. Why? :( part throw caution wind, fire scientists hope best?

called ""easy mode"" pandemic. Yes slow decline deaths, Sweden's fatalities order magnitude peers catching up. total tally rising ever higher peers.

In best possible cases Sweden they'll killed (thousands people years ahead time. probable case they'll killed thousands people nothing, except becoming pariahs. data day. new design particular page again.

yes deceptive, yes designed break link went viral, information would bet peak AZ sees 30k-50k new day. Entirely untrue. Passing law prevents people carrying sword, problem. Passing law requiring people carry sword, probably going pass constitutional muster. laws compel action, vast majority outlaw action. guys never proper lockdown. half-assed everything... Yeah that’s good deaths low people get severe symptoms like holes lungs probably wishing died. weird Germany anti-lockdown protests really big May, masks. somehow didnt lead outbreaks. anyone know anyone suuuper careful getting sick like stayed home time went essentials always washing hands wearing masks.. still got corona?  Bill Gates devil crazy theory goes way back 90s least. idea why. used bit dick back deserve he's done people billionaires ever would he's vilified. recommended general dosage 400-600mcg; tell doctors taking watch reactions. take vitamin supplements result findings keep getting reported, however, I'm going decline specifying much. research sure. always prioritize young person lot life left live?

This actually means one cannot conclude RNA gene sequences, scientists took tissue samples prepared mentioned vitro trials PCR tests finally “calibrated,” belong specific virus — case SARS-CoV-2.

Also, corporate bailouts often require deep cuts social welfare programs, disproportionately affect poor people. Last week saw one kid without mask. said ""wear mask young man""

Sadly, I've given hope people like swayed facts. Better use energy willing listen actually decent discourse. I’m practicing lawyer graduate law school would agree it’s unconstitutional impedes individual’s liberties. think lawmakers agree, hence 1) mask laws actually enforced 2) people actually bother reading texts laws, insanely specific riddled many exceptions rules, purposely designed way least attempt make constitutional. words “wear mask” absolutely unconstitutional “wear mask public A) B) conditions met” (which laws written publicized) well might pass muster. Still, fines aren’t enforced pretty much anywhere. That’s one needs know.

“Moreover, least sample, somewhat intuitive factor compliance COVID-19 prevention guidelines, education, related compliance way (neither directly indirectly via trust science).”

But study — like research — include limitations.

“A major caveat study conducted representative sample (our sample relatively highly-educated). also possible that, due convenience sampling, sample somewhat biased towards higher trust science highly compliant COVID-19 preventive measures,” Plohl said. Give people inch, they’ll take mile anyone reported actual percentage increase cases?

I see sequel Fury Road coming live, soon. Ask r/covid19. science sub coronavirus. like shoot them, bullet kill them, blood loss/organ failure did. Summary:

Dr. William Schaffner, infectious disease specialist Vanderbilt University, stresses importance wearing mask prevent spread coronavirus because, “the mask politics neither virus” probs bc parents sick kids Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* that's ignoring surface transmission concern also untested time. Also lot scientific literature I've seen around efficacy *non*-surgical masks published April later, although read SARS (v.1?) literature may missing scientific precedent. understanding masks time frame came talking well-trained surgeons agreed masks prevent droplet spread (and training preventing *any* droplets, mitigation droplet count). kind depends are. 

If northeast keep problem states think they'll able manage ok. 

As far rest country, think us really know what's going expect, including CDC.  feel like people either want blame protests rising case numbers, want say protests effect numbers all. Isn’t likely spread protests, outside people wearing masks, spread wasn’t large enough cause spike own? get you. Get couch see world attacked group people think like you. need help anger issues.

Congregations people work long, stated, wear masks, practice social distancing. proven within Europe places around world. fear driven panic facts based science. school able go back limited form. Shops throughout Europe open backed regulations protect people. 

But screaming fear CURRENT factual basis apart echo chamber set around yourself. research, look top current studies grouping. know back work, groups people, done given current studies. Hahaha. Ok I’ll admit it. years ago, knowledge politics, bought pillow. It’s biggest piece shit ever. Thanks making laugh. 75 enough... take us NY space couple people needs shut down. people per capita died Sweden anywhere EU.

No, true. count total reported covid-19 deaths per capita, Sweden lower Belgium, UK, Spain, Italy. easier avoid covid-19 quarantine. Unfortunately, work awful jobs risk our/everyone else's health can't draw unemployment take upon quarantine.

What mean mask ""compliance"" UK?

Masks mandated public transport here. I'd say 90% people Tube wearing masks, though agree people wearing properly.

If mean street, shops, etc. agree sub-10%. they're required places, I'm really sure call lack compliance. cooking stove works too

Sounds like Trump’s life motto tbh Professor Stephen Bustin world-renowned expert quantitative PCR, research focuses translating molecular techniques practical, robust reliable tools clinical diagnostic authored numerous papers, review articles book chapters aimed improving reproducibility robustness real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), including three books: A-Z quantitative PCR (2004), PCR Revolution (2011) PCR Technology (2013). 

Thousands people published PCR used world.

Just give yout crazy idea Gandalf PCR. simply exist.

Believing Gandalf PCR crazy think there's like one guy world knows everything motorbikes micro wave according him, Cq 20 30 aimed at, concern regarding reliability results Cq 35.

""Should"" mean ""should always be"", yes, tests concerns reliability, obviously deal routine matter.

Dealing labs routine put cheese pizza pizzeria. job is, every day, every Cq value gets high, becomes difficult distinguish real signal background, example due reactions primers fluorescent probes, hence higher probability false positives.

All tests cutoffs. scale cut-off.

That matters, not, determine cut-off running tests. super easy do, takes like half day.

You run samples calibration curve according whatever parameter want see cut-off relates to, look curve, know cut-off transformation process “widely recognized inefficient variable,” Jessica Schwaber Centre Commercialization Regenerative Medicine Toronto two research colleagues pointed 2019 paper.

SO what? test works, it. 

All tests issues, validate problem course conversion process (RNA cDNA) amount DNA obtained RNA base material vary widely, even factor 10 (see interview).

That run samples know DNA content together samples know it?

The stuff misunderanding stuff explain students within like first half hour teaching run DNA sequences get doubled every cycle, even slight variation becomes magnified thus alter result, annihilating test’s reliable informative value.

Wrong. Maybe samples known DNA shows cannot rely content particular run. still use test show presense non presense DNA.

If run test say elephant DNA comes elephant DNA it, might know much elephant sample, sure contained claim PCR tests highly meaningful so-called COVID-19 diagnosis blind fundamental inadequacies tests—even confronted questions regarding validity?

Because things mentiones totally mundane problems also applies scales.

Scales also cut-off, must consitinously calabrated forth. lab work let's suppose tests accurately detect RNA sequences, still scientific proof RNA sequences causative agent called COVID-19. 

Off course is. zero, nothing whatsoever PCR.

PCS used detect RNA DNA. 

It's completely different methods used proove covid-19 caused covid.

The process identifying diseases know. assume take blood tests split various contents everything it, find new thing seen before, that's get tract new thing causing new disease.

Then test blood samples like 100 people new disease 100 different likely causes, share covid-19, well found link know causes disease.

There many, many methods used thise studies.

Your argument sheer utter nonsense. 

A disease diagnoses many, many methods. PCR good fast, could also things instead.

That nothing whatsoever discovering pathogen causes disease. Funny enough, big argument going back school person social emotional learning especially primary grades. kind learning happens recess, hallway, cafeteria, library etc. least stands now, person learning primary grades would mean sitting classroom day meals delivered room, playtime breaks inside room, push ins specials teachers. ""americans"" politicizing everything, media politicians. feel live people like this? I'm US would go crazy times. rural Oregon True, said “at least”.  Yes, viral load many nurses doctors died. Many healthy probably would've fine otherwise, level virus system greatly impacts outcome. Masks definitely going reduce that. 1%.

Utah county government fighting tooth nail local newspapers getting name two companies deliberately didn’t follow state mandates caused large spread events....   Well armchair expert armchair experts.  kinda surprised me, I’m KS lived couple tiny towns there, people conservative seem like type follow libruls staying home, masks, etc. Welcome boring goody two shoes 4th. Gov. Tubby’s plan based science imaginary “experts” won’t name show anyone, including media, data looking at. trust him, Illinois fine. measure like fourth wave though. evidence points transmission surfaces really really low Robots.. Nothing. Aliens, bring on. 
Dolphins that's WHOLE different thing. rethink strategy. antivaxxer? definitely heavy propaganda spread antivaxxer community Covid exaggerated take away medical freedoms. Stupid lemmings follow Daddy cliff, insisting he's right way down. Alright we’ll definitely better 12%, still great...tomorrow telling day I""ll get fat ticket don't. Imagine mask compliance started fining people regularly Deaths always trail weeks, though. People don’t get test die, many sick weeks succumb. hope stay low, I’m concerned don’t want get hopes up. ): Though younger people better chance, since it’s predominantly young people getting ill maybe better.

But honestly, I’m concerned long term effects deaths. 30 year old friend got March barely stand minutes still. :\ That’s worries me. country national stockpile PPE sad.  Chiiiiinaaaaa Darwin got work cut right Here's one you. son came early - made 2 appointments time happened due finding pregnancy late early came. still pay full amount visits tests (our part 2k). work father, son daughter. daughter tested positive Covid. since live together, 3 quarantine home. pockets good amongst insanity. Seattle, converted two vehicle emissions test sites coronavirus testing stations run University Washington Medical Center. Cost test: $0 logic cant make masks mandatory open everything ?  seriously restaurants open.

you cant keep cross contamination one server touching everyones stuff.

its safe. problem, congrats! mind all, good call well, bit disingenious. done implies wearing mask status quo stigma-free. wasnt heinous could admit clever. like hell. LEADERS FORESIGHT ALL???? Like people become leaders...  Similar Wildwood cousin told me. imagine likely locals going mask-less (they might even call mask-free! 🤣 Dummies) people Philly &amp; NYC instead can't wait couple months... run one successful vaccination programs time. Saving thousands, millions. death numbers increase fast truly control - NY went 80 deaths day 800 day less two weeks. promising sure. prior current virus pandemic, main team pushing research supposed meet FDA June present data FDA sign 222nm safe long term human exposure hospital settings.

Fucking hell... 2020 people still dumber rocks. fuck going spread chinese mini-plage already? Staying home means staying situation longer time much worse economy. Umm sure DeSantis (Florida governor) backtracked yet. counties FL requiring masks thats majors decided thing since DeSantis still head sand. wouldn’t say that’s true, normal people yes, enough assholes think otherwise. Met lot people looked living parents 23, better off. guy tell lost interest found I’m struggling pay school....  half assed thing, real lockdown means, country traffic lights opening plan México city switched red orange. one relaxing measures IMO, epidemy rise country testing beyond shameful, fucked. pockets good amongst insanity.

Cost test: $0 thought airlines proper filters? atleast claim offices windows open? potential concerns rushed vaccine?  saw something today setting overflow capacity. Arizona closing bars, movie theaters, nightclubs, water really well long time without masks. Better long time Denmark, really well lauded international community model response. Incidentally, also didn’t use masks. really wasn’t indoor A/C season started Florida started poorly. duct systems fast -- air get enough time exposed UV source anything useful. Still, AC guys sell lot them.  High markup (commissioned) items. threaten it. People cooperating months ago saying worthless, still feel correct justify wearing mask. make happen. every meal ever eat fried chicken mashed potatoes inevitably last meal. bars open never were. places serving food qualify restaurant outdoor dining. think need Google research one. strong desire see Dresden. really funny move there. really publicly funded research it? Exactly. even set business like that? workers struggling financially add confusing rules top that? Mask dinning closing go hand hand sure ppl homeless state. know lot restaurant workers many already lost homes moved back parents friends. Another friend 33 opened bar last year. lost everything mental health scares me. double edged sword. Ppl think lives economy. not. lives lives, aware ones non COVID related right bc seem important COVID19 deaths. But, they’ll silencing conservative voices! /r years

Only you’ve literally procrastinated end cost countless lives, it’s issue. 

There’s backtracking shit. People like need charged criminal fucking negligence. mean, possible, may never happen, that's likely scenario. I'd think one happen, effort we're putting freaking hope so, may take longer optimists saying. think years may timeline, rather months.

There's never vaccine made coronavirus, including SARS working on, also much funding profit motive previously. SARS effectively dead, though would nice vaccine case popped (now I'm imagining virus deadly SARS contagious SARS-COV-2, great...), coronaviruses really deadly / troublesome. lack coronavirus vaccine mean game-over, something worth considering prevent optimism running amok. churches  work subsidized housing complex. they're going forgive back rent, we're going end evicting 50% tenants. matter sooner rather later. Orange County fucking numbers people get protest passes allow protest?

I'm even joking. Would Newsom (or governor) go far say protests over, stay inside? Safe say dodged bullet least. ass.

Being hospitalized covid benign feat life long consequences. mention bill. Given outbreak China effectively controlled, conditions place Phase III clinical trial conducted.

I'm aware. simply explaining ""cutting corners"" concern came from. US use phrase ""approved for"" means vaccine completed phase III trials been, guessed it, ""approved"". can't ""approved for"" anything unless drug brought fully market crazy think vaccine would completed phase III efficacy testing 6 months. hasn't. concern regarding cutting corners. drug still tested even though headline says approved. Same. can’t go back walking battles garbage incense. meant know happens. say, ""You can't tell do"" sheriff's say enforce it. sheriff tests positive nobody learns anything.

I'm tired people fighting serious disease is. chinese international community paper. usually given free, even get Australia. Usually anti-CCP, since CCP boner jailing Falun Gong members/practitioners Epoch champions cause/practice. Yeah, heard similar exactly thing friends live US.

Such shame see US go route last decade, learn government done last 5 (8?) decades bring about.  absolutely never have. Look around world, country issue anywhere near highly polarized States. There’s certain someone fueled fire beginning continues so, result lose Every time see smug's face can't help scream F\*\*\*\*\*\* n\*\*\*\*\*\* loud head. Good news! Quebec going back daily reporting. numbers screwed days. Tomorrow back normal.

Regarding FTWs; province needs put foot mandatory testing. totally agree letting asymptomatic carriers back work. That's dumbest thing I've heard level Canadian government since crisis started. People weird. know guy anti-mask anti-Trump vocal both. Ph.D molecular biology, too. I'm NJ tons people disagree think Murphy good job trying get control. popular opinion alot people cant stand man surgery still trying help anyway could. Suprising live people masks I've worked entire time even people work taking seriously. Hopefully keep seen shore traffic last weekend like back old ways. See, friends medical field would possibly know restructuring/redistribution covid units. case, become known. Or, least certainly hope so.

And knowing number calls phone lines, number requested tests, etc vs actual tested would interesting see case. happen, unfortunately. could also take special quarantine centers. relatively deaths? go happy land covid-19 would dare infect them. whole US able sue stupidity. Ahh, they'll back sucking asses China Russia decide carve up. Everyone hates us need military. BA left chat. I'm sorry, I'm high brain process ""teachers fall""."" 🤦🏼‍♀️ California around 23k nothing anecdotal reply third point:

I live Korea, everyone wears masks people wear wrong handles improperly. 

Even so, less containing spread huge spike February (so far) without shutdown. 

While understand US different situation currently, think based Korea’s experience, mandating masks would beneficial not- even despite ill-handling. Thogmartin cited experience autopsies

This kinda weird. autopsies people asymptomatic cases? people die from? elderly people? Welcome hell, Chicago. 

Signed, someone CA who's weeks already. ready fall,it still need go testing trial periods,it average American get it. One rare times ""I told so"" bittersweet. came corona week ago. Last week fever gone feeling shortness breath (although oximeter showed 95) Well work wanted positive test results sent in. go clinic retrieve them. I've felt good today used old mask car. evening I'm feeling little warm I'm worried, could re-infected using old mask? 

I've thrown case. would point days 101.5 fever gone back normal 4 straight days. really affecting us much all, health wise least.

I hope never does.

I hope go went NYC Freezer trailer trucks brought makeshift morgues outside local hospital sound sirens 24/7 weeks. stopped people seriously social distanced wore gloves masks. looking like gloves necessary masks essential. Still might miss town, smart actual risks, know hit area till week two hits area. Yeah, mean, probably reworded that, doubletake too.

Or, likely, that's exactly aimed do. That’s doozy. would send link one old docs 40s magic vacuum tubes. thought Bill Gates using vacuum tubes turn people robots ... I’m loss words. Make sure take lot loonies. miss you, understand. pencil us double visit Summer 2021? realize work home, i'm also realizing also work red shores PEI well. Wow!

I've never seen that.

Thanks! dismantled government. Goddamn knuckleheads ruining shit us across nation people understand wear masks. poor doctor choose better chance surviving. would think cases 87 year old knew going would problem telling doctor give ventilator 20 year old relieve burden doctor. Unfortunately, time moment comes 87 year old probably mentally anymore understand going on. poor doctor make decisions live it. imagine doctor many doctors making decision multiple times one shift. barely upvotes? great news! anything wrong know many national Guardsmen have? u even know contact tracing work suspending writ habeus corpos civil war. 
My point federal leadership thing weak denial filled hobbled Governors would acted decisively also encouraged foolish ones.

You reap sown. see getting politicized has? Maybe I'm dumb too, really think asking people wear mask potentially save millions lives would turn shitshow. Nice, need bonuses pokemon go last longer  Except that's true.

I hate misinformation filters general. ""High grade fitted mask"" means nothing shitty filters; really THING SHITTY FILTERS.

Filters range work for. work small particles; big; work big small really well medium size particles don't!(N95).

Regardless point provide level protection. N95 really rated filter particles specific size 95% reduction.

That's it. Wearing board front face; filters all; provides personal protection; board face.

It matter directly filtering everything. reduces larger droplet transmission basically mask.

Moreover... People forget viral load matters. Yes much virus get initially matters(For viruses covid-19). 

So yes; even reducing eliminating chances getting sick; still get sick MASK STILL JOB REDUCING OVERALL INITIAL VIRAL LOAD. some; may mean life/death outcome; serious outcome.

Moreover; mask protect eyes still get sick via eyes.

The point reduction. want everyone wearing disposable coveralls; half mask P100 filters/face shield full mask P100 filters.

Even then... still get it. 

So NO. NEED HIGH GRADE FITTED MASK. got one; great.

But bad advice essentially telling people ""If can't get high grade fitted mask; protected bother mask all?"". want downvote don’t like it, I’m upvoting happened y’all isn’t fair all!!! hard get coronavirus two people wearing mask outside, socially distanced? I’ve heard it’s hard get coronavirus outdoors general, masks certainly help prevent getting virus people wearing one. someone give input this? People sit restaurants day drink. building liscense sell food doesn’t make different bar terms spreading pathogens. I’m getting pretty god damn sick this. person district. 1,600 Chromebooks. Please, please, please encourage child take care his/her Chromebook. Even schools closed, report repair Chromebooks unknown infection. Annnnnd America screwed. Highly unlikely, relatives state tell talking many refusing wear mask especially 25-45 group world’s population almost quadrupled since 1950s. doesn’t take rocket scientist understand land expensive wages low. Holy shit website 3-minute ad 2 minute video. LOL even rock accepts wearing mask. people DUMBER rocks. Depends charge, guess. children would let go back long time. Love that! Ahh yes, mutation brain altering virus turns us rage zombies I’ll stick 5 minute clips YouTube playlist thank much. could happened? Almost like asshole highest ranking position country calls fake news scoffs masks shutdowns. mom drive sit far rear. wear well-fitted masks keep windows open bit reasonably safe:.assuming positive infectious, open windows allow ventilation within vehicle, diluting amount viral droplets air reduce chance infection. may also want minimize speaking, research suggest speaking produce almost much droplets coughing. home, sure contagious, try keep interactions mom outdoors possible, maybe open windows must inside room together time. Take care good luck Good, late, sorry. clue first place many sick dying people sick dying. time. Wear individualized face mask cats something. Last surge patients 60. time patients &lt; 40. Maybe bitterness nihilism rendered Gen X immune virus. !remindme 25 days

u/shaggymex happened Kansas City only. writers South Park every comedy show parodies irl events going absolute wealth material draw inspiration year. we're halfway through...  Los Angeles non-compliance among significant number people frequented bars restaurants without regard social distancing wearing masks. lot people L.A. continued compliant, enough people seed infection.

I read 80% restaurants/bars compliance regulations re-opened. right. really do. Sadly political anything. team work collecting data present data articles white papers coming weeks help spread knowledge. Unlikely it'll ever hit major headlines though. big company monetary investment publicity. would harder enforce punishment everyone it? bar town tried open shutdown owner go court. simple someone placing phone call, police showing up, observing violations, issuing court order. It’s certainly complicated thing law enforcement ever done. far sympathetic...I don’t know. cops showed bar town state police, don’t think shrug sympathy. Yeah rock would let put mask it. California issue this. 

Hit shit zones done it. could clearing COVID shit end next month. time Thanksgiving. CA people Even *only* care yourself, great affordable public health care benefits you. Mostly gives cheaper health care (even use best private health care yourself), also likely healthier neighbors healthier.

Not mention healthy society produce gives entire nation advantage.

However, might harder find people willing ""do time military"" education health care affordable. might fun pandemic next decade two. 

None unexpected. literally wargaming shortly Covid-19 happened using fictional coronavirus came pig farm South America. 

We know flu coronavirus strains high potential mutate zoonotic transmission kick epidemics. frequency occurs statistically getting faster, large part blamed modern commercial farming practices. 

Eventually we'll figure effectively deal things really seem suggestion VA compared MD, especially leave NoVA. mandate written differently? stores Maryland let without mask, I've seen enforced multiple times. I've read 50% survivors showing signs central nervous system damage  Underrated comment whatever happened this? latest trend protests happened stopped hearing anything this. Yes is. Size vehicle nothing it. number seats does. that's said. 8 passengers requires D1 license. sue? stay open. Salon owner Dallas governor Abbot amended executive order can't enforce law. ya, believe it. There's nothing wrong that. thing. canceling opposites making :)  People wear masks know sick China. Culturally it’s respect people. cary Covid show symptoms. Yeah, schools supposed open first week August pushed back least 8/17. people taken seriously all, numbers insane. Hospitals filling fast, surge capacity probably last long there's talk going ""crisis care"" doctors decide treat resources low. definitely time pretend things fine!  I'm hearing go music festivals! US government “helped.” claim proportional percent discount, objections there. I'm process selling house can't avoid people unilaterally. really surprised mask let handful people onto property. NONE masks on. I'm getting nervous I'll get sick even mask many asshats can't avoid wearing them. Sheesh, thanks lot guys not. China lies numbers. always have, always will. ingrained culture. Get results save face. 

The US culture collectivism. getting told do. magnified Trump supporters. Sadly comes COVID nothing. Either work together suffer. chose suffer. Ctrl+Alt+Delete year. I've actually got friend well former friend believes shit. thinks im sheep he's seen several dodgy YouTube videos bill gates evil Water wet. Close doug douche bag liberal bay area, selfish idiots try spin need help small businesses going restaurants people wait us! way.....ugh hitting record cases ambulance clatter picking back makes extremely sad Technically right sue literally anything. sue post. expectation winning file lawsuit absolutely anything. green light outdoor music festivals? movie theaters still alive this, except specialty places like Alamo Roadhouse, I’ll shocked . Many places south west built tore - rebuilding - surge capacity. thought beaten that. almost someone posing leader pulled biggest, boneheaded Mission Accomplished time.  baddies now? Yeah (new me) CDC rep trotting progression *should be* news one.

Jan: Shit, start prepping massive test campaign, close borders?

Feb: Still real testing! Borders pretty much open except travellers China.

Mar: Shit, **still** enough testing. NY Washington community spread. let's anything rash like prep medical system start track trace elsewhere.

April: Lockdown sort-of implemented! (depending are). PPE sill handled. Track/trace/isolate would great end successful lockdowns!

May: Testing finally ramping lockdowns successful/maintained places. Track trace work curve never flattened! Track trace still pipe dream. Field hospitals *removed* / health care workers laid off...

June: Surprise! health care remained unprepared, lockdowns weak short, cases really dropped peak. ""Hey everyone, track trace work scenario!""

Duhhhhh   least peaks nowhere go down, right? never understood CA reopened begin cases going down. I'm praying god countries find sympathy take American refugees. weird fucking phrase say but, warped back 2015 told someone life 2020.....well know Agreed people fail realize hospitals same. older health care systems aging physicians date equipment including beds, ventilators, etcZz also, hospitals 2-4 ORs (surgical beds) operating given day compete critical Code Blues triggered patients go duress. 

It’s tough people need take seriously. better things rage wearing masks FFS That's ridiculously inefficient. probably spreadsheet/program random number function. Much quicker. New cases surging. Death rates still remain low deaths lag hospitalizations diagnoses (could anywhere week 4 weeks).

It young getting infected generally healthier fewer comorbidities, know virus, better treatements. Death rates rise much March/April period. However big caveat this. young also reckless general could spread right back parents grandparents could cause death rates spike right back up. Ah! ‘11 brother ‘10. usually tell people I’m rancho $100 entertainment money/month? can’t even imagine level entertainment. Obviously domestic Shanghai case raises eyebrow, went look Shanghai Municipal HC daily report. Turns crazy:

29/06/2020, border control agencies report 3 imported cases COVID-19 1 domestic case related imported case:

Notice case although case 4 Indian citizen, infected Shanghai quarantine counting domestic case. Actually aren’t anything... 

It’s people trying something outside spreading spose societal norm. They've always worn masks colds such. kicking Home free refills. one allowing travel U.S. safe one. Agreed I'm terrified what's coming Wisconsin.  read saying fuck govenor allowing crisis care implemented. Whoa. took months, McConnell finally got one right. ever happened before? richest country planet can't even provide free tests global pandemic. That's shocking embarrassing part read without apostrophe. thought saying Europe trusts US since like one country's presidents collapsed stage something. Kind hard tell Curry going half-ass mandating face masks now. Let's hope see mom Karen video news... Notice hard push opinion? people opposite. Something think about. Early July, NY level surge. Yes saying there's chance!! Barrett best crowds :D was/is executive order outlining safety guidelines business economy ""safely return"" SIP order. Stuff like physical distancing, sanitizing, mask mandates. shit, obviously. live Finland. No-one wears masks, 0 people ICU. Government review found masks significant made recommendation them. Mask magic cure. Theaters still make way money straight stream personally, movie theaters screen 40 times size mine, crazy sound, provide much better experience even people like complain one time people talking. mean, cooking stove works too. idea BBQ interest envy.  customer never right. Popus, entitled, rude, smelly, aggressive, shitting floor wiping underwear walls, pissing another customers table,, never right. Back April, remarked wife Vladimir Putin would idiot take advantage pandemic divide damage country. lot terrible things, definitely idiot.

Do think opposition wearing masks seeded Russia hostile state actors? (Perhaps China, too?)

This really hit home someone know charge company’s COVID19 response (and fine job far could tell) told wears mask work doesn’t going grocery store “CO2 buildup.” particular bit destructive misinformation disproved simple video doctor pulse oximeter wearing mask wearing one showing O2 saturation exactly either case, 99%. Wherever got nonsense from, causing lot damage. Stupid extreme left Goldman Sachs trying take EVERYONE’S FAVORITE PEESIDENT! basically want everyone lock homes like federal prisoners state prisoners, never going out.

Sorry: people going **MAJORITY** CoVid-19 nothing minor illness speaking someone damned disease minor killed parents!

People sick tired idiots like want basically put cryogenic suspension nothing ""Until vaccine!""

We're tired it! Admit majority disease MINOR ANNOYANCE move on.

Tell elderly stay frick home! Tell immuno-compromised stay frick home! Tell terrified illness 99% mild stay frick home! 

This last coming straight CDC numbers including suspected asymptomatic cases never caught.

Tell three groups pull credit cards order groceries home worried.

People seem realize populace sick tired lockdowns limitations.

Even someone lost parents sick them, even though wear mask go outside home Maryland.

Honestly starting go insane lack human contact home little little since parents real human contact past 5 years helping take care Dad working going out.

Without parents without able go hang friends? I'm slowly losing it! COVID's already got one.

Fucks lungs, kidneys, heart, brain, liver. Think read something pancreas. blood clots fuck organs. Americans need business closures. Government needs save us ourselves. sucks many bars/restaurants probably go business. thought keep saying there's spike due protests actually got sick day march,” said Turner. “I could move bed. bed sighing.”

Um, means likely get virus march. always seem case anytime people post articles? worrying.

The virus spreads fast kinds facilities. People high risk living disease.... countries protected citizens many negative side effects regulations robust social safety nets like universal healthcare, higher education, rent controls.

We cut brake lines smashed gas pedal... Movie theaters over... It’s safe say chains going bankrupt privately owned theaters able survive. I'm glad opened link clearly look 2 seconds. graph tracks responses way today, that's got figures from. 

It's incredibly self-important think US literally centre world countries blocked US would fine. There's also South America, South Asia, Middle East persistent domestic transmission virus countries deal with. incredibly naive think go away. hiiiiis? I've set tip amount minimum 33%, big Larry Bird fan. (Boston Celtics #33). STILL ppe shortages? joked deaths nursing homes? He’s ass. gonna lie friend something would’ve rather wrong about. parents live AZ I’m pretty anxious STDs would exist people wore condoms **all time**.

If people always wore condoms sex, would massively help reduce spread STDs.

If wore condoms *all time*, could well much harm good. would make going toilet difficult start. help laugh wins again, despicable would be. time alive history. Empire Bay: Leo Amery Diaries, 1929-1945 Considering region Veneto brings plenty money industries massive port right next makes wayyy money own... you’re right, don’t need them. makes sense. It’s whenever tell people this, shrug say it’s tests, go hanging friends without masks :( enforce it. People criticized Italy lockdown practically draconian worked. Here, lockdown pretty much voluntary work. say true.

This article? Noah Smith computer scientist working junction natural language processing, machine learning, computational social science.

He accurately describes current situation. predictions rooted attempt accuracy.

Better look someone like Warren Buffet. Look divested long-held stocks. zero confidence USA right now. sure downvoted. Good luck, keep head down. bubble universe live in? 126k dead US! Yes, awful lot people ""sick sick"".

That many people die illnesses flus year. majority elderly 75 older, preexisting medical conditions would died year anyways. Another 25% untested counted covid deaths covid system died complications disease spreading regions overwhelmed first wave, currently handled fairly smoothly, change number cases ramp up. Even still, people dying disease every day.

It's already spread since first wave. testing done. That's new case. example Covid back march, went get test now, would positive new case, even though sick is. (source)

That shows curve flattening around May anything works. First off, positivity rate going up. Look means. something masked testing.

Yes is. means people testing positive. mean they're sick. Like said, positive test 2 months get disease months. lasts 5-10 days people.

That's meant. meant sick months ago, tested today first time would positive including ""New cases"" total, even though case months trying invent reasons trust science, please. might well throwing pasta wall see sticks.

Stop ignoring point. common symptoms:

fever
dry cough
tiredness
Less common symptoms:

sore throat
diarrhoea
conjunctivitis

a rash skin, discolouration fingers toes
Serious symptoms:

chest pain pressure
loss speech movement

What symptoms ARENT covid now? Oh stuffy nose? Let put ventilator make $50,000. remove twitter internet? It’s destroying society. probably first time Tropicana Field ever reached capacity I’d recommend avoiding Plaid Pantry. Unfortunately, I’m mistaken unless N95 goggles / face shield you’re fully protected. surgical mask tends work best worn infected like think adds even sort protection wearer n95 level. interesting observation. +1 protesters rioters allowed run free without masks. Agreed, here's argument keeping schools wide open even pandemic.

I'm extreme testing, keep everything open, like successful countries done. leadership really pretending protests didn’t happen aren’t happening eh? last thing Europe needs mission groups ~~that socially distancing~~. media &amp; health organizations Yeah, month late. miss days sub debated delaying.... recommendation make recommendation specific situations. not, not, made recommendation wear masks specifically states lack scientific evidence first sentence. Round round, quoting right website. 

I could say ""I recommend everyone buy Ford, best!"" could say ""Ford's really proven better cars. recommend everyone's Dad recommend buy Ford want car that, certain circumstances, may better""

Have fun day imagining that. fool enough idiot see density.

Mayos race, mayo. currently undergoing mass testing Russian hospitals, far results good, average, take drug show positive dynamics 3-4 days (and patients placebo 9 days), almost side effects. law, testing lasts long time, final test completed 2024. Nevertheless, patients already receive drug 30 Russian hospitals. Two approved drugs (levilimab areplivir) also tested Russian hospitals. key move reproduction number 1 (so number infected people starts going down, up) without shut economy. Masks perfect accomplish that. That's fine. ""shirking responsibility circumstances"" hits nail right head.

There bar/club owners found loose loophole “served” food restaurant opened up. Mean packing business people every weekend disregarding social distancing. goes water parks none even remotely implementing social distancing. speak gyms refused step foot them. massively packed parking lots ones drive indicate also didn’t give shit social distancing mask wearing. 

You guys couldn’t responsible business owners follow basic guidelines shut another month. know MAGA idiot posts stuff too. wife nurse oddly post tragic stories facts surround virus, also stuff seems make jabs people “over-reacting.” She’s nurse. *Alabama enters chat* heads up, D614G means substitution mutation occurred amino acid number 614 aspartic acid (D) substituted glycine (G) knuckleheads gonna knucklehead. ever learn government appalling. committed terrorist attack never seen things deleted internet like videos been. videos people collapsing street.

I’ve posted full subreddit:

Something totally play right now, due early aggressive re-openings pushed current administration state governors.

When happens, means medical system maxed out, people likely end dying, enough medical resources able help everyone, due excessive numbers patients/causalities.


Sigh... get it. months. hard put mask public. Surely Americans see nations doing, people put masks. countries poor, live closed quarters practice much social distancing want to. yet numbers, per capita, way smaller. People understand let control ICU, hospital beds etc overloaded. critical need medical attention cases like cancer wait give way infected virus. Really sad still fighting whether put masks not. Protect elderly vulnerable. Ok. Totally get agree Professor Rutherford smart source. asked paper testing protocols. none. tests. professionals opinion. 

I'm trying make light opinion. I'm pointing nothing said backed published study. There's lot maybes wiggle words statements opinion. know protects more. know **helps** protect everyone everyone fucking it. Talk stupid. award today, America. mean, still getting worse... So... Sure? majority deaths elderly minorities. course there's will. Welcome consolation, looks like insignificant number contract COVID end severe long-term health problems like ravaged lungs kidneys neurological damage, ignoring it, even die, they're potentially condemning lifetime suffering.

Edit: there's also knowledge anticoagulation needed working patients, again. Understanding guiding clinical protocols getting better still unfortunately adequate. someone knows personally one's body terrible things goes I'm sad see awful effects this. worried long term damage even beyond awful short term effects/deaths. would encourage Trump anything disappear missed grand opportunity sell Trump branded masks. big red mask MAGA front. said anything that? prevalence disease actually higher parts US somehow lockdown unacceptable?  reason failure government, specifically federal, leadership. worst places like NY. places we’ve delayed worst  Okay, let's review diseases work.

Diseases spread exponentially. means every x days, number cases doubles. So, wait respond outbreak hospitals full, given ***can't change course next week disease, matter change today*** (because people get sick week already infected today) far overwhelmed catch up.

Indeed, see trend rising, earlier take action better. New York locked city fairly early on, even barely managed make resources had.

So there's resurgence, either take action soon detected might well start writing condolences letters... lots them.

That They're positive tests, they're sick

No, mix. Many people tested tested specifically symptoms. random testing done public another story, that's whole picture. I’m really impressed northeast handled it, really worried NYC. leaned edge somehow came back. 

400k dead easy, way vaccine end year. Even it, it’s going long time US gets back feet, considering abysmal state pretty much everything *before* COVID. rest world thriving US sinks. 

There absolutely going hard lockdowns Florida said done. also bodies piled warehouses waiting processing hospitals funeral homes. virus exposed true problems world, especially culture United States. government US microcosm much bigger problem. think point society caused shitty behavior. coincidence many americans unwilling people countries arent.  Buckle Ugh. Disgusting.  guess we're different points life, I'm paying much that. Definetely tens thousands I've ever spent past healthcare. President, leader US, wearing mask. Like states closing beaches, Florida one know offhand, worries me. see two things happening:

1. People flock beaches remaining open, making crowded mixing people different regions together increase chance spread.
2. move inside venues like house parties, even worse inside rather outside.

The number people see think, ""Hrm, closing beaches, socially responsible spend holiday wekeend home family"" probably majority. Yeah, we're complete agreement. think confusion knowledge CDC never said “not worry” anything indicate masks ineffective protecting COVID.

I think meant, might unclear me, **literally** say masks useless. told people wear them. second ""once lifetime"" bailout billionaires get fucked Lol.

They upset wearing mask, go couple months without haircut, able sit-down meal Applebee's.

Oh well must nothing. wonder would happen people could wait disclose insurance got price.

Currently it’s set ask price hospital basically ask “how much got?” Like many people, trusted institution would withstand man work running nation done dedicated men women put safety prosperity America else.

They like government authority applies specifically, military-like authority ok bad neighborhoods. also like science authority. Probably pretty much *always* goes first authority mentioned comment. 

So disagree general dislike authority. like fine context important (white) man giving directives. Please tell I’m one always reads Homer’s voice... That's secondary source.

I asking specifically primary source, source articles books use. Force people back work = lower unemployment numbers. ton job opportunities right now... endangered newborn child. going tell media irresponsible. nobody prevention probably emphasis bit. believe data shows people sick weeks less common even rare. people get sick within week usually 2-4 days. real ugly mindset have. sorry callous.

Jeffrey M. Perkel Scientist referred Nov 30, really? made up?

Listen yourself.

And, according him, Cq 20 30 aimed at, concern regarding reliability results Cq 35.

**If Cq value gets high, becomes difficult distinguish real signal background,** example due reactions primers fluorescent probes, hence higher probability false positives.

Moreover, among factors alter result, starting actual PCR, case looking presumed RNA viruses SARS-CoV-2, RNA must converted complementary DNA (cDNA) enzyme Reverse Transcriptase—hence “RT” beginning “PCR” “qPCR.”

This transformation process *“widely recognized inefficient variable,”* Jessica Schwaber Centre Commercialization Regenerative Medicine Toronto two research colleagues [pointed 2019 problem course conversion process (RNA cDNA) amount DNA obtained RNA base material vary widely, even factor 10 (see interview).

**Considering DNA sequences get doubled every cycle, even slight variation becomes magnified thus alter result, annihilating test’s reliable informative value.**

So claim PCR tests highly meaningful so-called COVID-19 diagnosis blind fundamental inadequacies tests—even confronted questions regarding validity?

But let's suppose tests accurately detect RNA sequences, **there still scientific proof RNA sequences causative agent called COVID-19.** 

**Therefore tests entirely meaningless.** Yeah, guess kind dick move. don’t good reason disagree you. argued shut caused rise doesnt make whole lotta sense completely false seen argument used I'm positive messes numbers many tested positive there. I'd also see Dr go back work instead going back two week period quarantine Right you. state decided collectively pretend virus never happened. numbers worse ever. probably indicates widespread community think tbh. mAbs may cheap make people said thread, cost biologics determined manufacturing costs rather way incentivize companies keep researching. yea, mAbs generally costs thousands.

My friend's supervisor alerted one locations affected hotspot Texas. immediately exploded ""OH CAN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING NEWS GARBAGE!""

Ok location Texas outbreak checking plans that...

They literally trying say **maybe outbreaks Texas even happening.** fake. Like, actually made Anderson Cooper political agenda.

It's way worse realise. hypocrite oath Oh thank god, I'm starting feel really sketched living here. sense CDC

Aka: said something supports narrative k, want people confused think rate lot lower actually is, that's all. understand it, there's debate many studies done masks various settings (surgery, outbreaks, etc.) inconclusive. Kansas support protests message, don’t act like theres going new cases them. know exemption longer, right? hypocrite oath be, work enforcing mask rule making unsafe work environment. left open lawsuits workers get Covid would enforce mask rule anything else Downvote away, I'm wrong cousin believe covid killing people, always underlying condition, coronavirus.

""They died asthma, happened covid-19 also"" 

""It blood pressure, coronavirus, killed them""

Shit like that. American, I've many similar thoughts. We're descended people eschewed values staying family craved adventure enough take huge, terrible risks. founded violence quite bit ""take what's mine, everyone else damned."" one reasons, think, U.S. high rate violent crime compared European nations particular. violent/brave/individualistic folks left/were ran homelands ended here. put much value traits passed generations. little odd hearing least vast majority people wearing masks state numbers flat despite opening up. actually feels little weird wear mask. think big part masks US get awkwardness wearing one comes easily bulk folks around wearing one. areas mentality need start closing business business enforce mask rules get ball rolling. forced wear mask go eventually feels natural end always wearing it. seems like best chance give control Donkeys, despite flaws, ones taking seriously. Regardless, going long time get control. Here's info....

 

TLDR....Vitamin improves calcium absorption, enough calcium Vitamin pull bones.

Vitamin control calcium goes K2 required make sure goes bones, teeth rather soft tissues leads heart kidney disease. 

So basically....make sure getting 3. Email writers books articles 

You quoted source several times didn’t take that. took virus wild even precautions still happen. I’m literally precautions (lockdown, disinfecting everything, going outside walks) it’s scary think still might enough. asshole neighbor get within 2 feet day clearly backed atrium wall trying stay away, felt intentional since walking way long way her. I’m person complex wearing masks neighbors don’t give space common areas. One meaning cite ""make reference to"". use meaning title, understand different manner; ""citing"" would done travelers U.S., EU. Exactly guess, thing better nothing theory, even though masks don’t jack, especially cloth one. buddy making fun like, “is wife’s underwear face?” Lol, cause pink made polyester cotton, like panties. That's even joke. Texas, HEB reinstated purchasing limits toilet paper paper towels. true. Thats too. want sit indoor space breathing air everyone else time sso go sit restaurants. person go dammit follow damn rules!

America full idiot two year olds adult bodies! Tie bandana around face.

Or find ""how make mask old t-shirt rubber bands"" video.

Oh hell. figured self-masking now, probably can't Google, ever blows (or least declines point travel restrictions diminished) leaving country never coming back. Denmark actually deaths per capita USA end March. 

And date cases first started trending instead Denmark USA. April 4th USA daily new cases started going down, Denmark days later actually Apr 7.

They didn’t control better outset all. OK Karen. mask mask. long you’re wearing right covers whole bottom face, you’ll fine. ""Without fixes infrastructure, education, health care government, U.S. resemble developing nation decades.""

It's sad state affairs. course actually won’t know ever end, yes proven respect long immunity lasts even develop immunity.  Trying draw comparison flu good reference point, agree terms effectiveness flu vaccines documented range. problem effects virus much severe across wider segment population.  So, sure, 250,000 die wave many additional people end reduced lung capacity ailments beginning understand. get flu well, nearly rate seeing covid. answer - whoever keeps patrons walking street beer, whoever kicks people stealing, whoever makes people put cigarette, whoever bans customer groping employee, whoever cards everyone make sure 21 (else get kicked out). Whoever enforces ""no shirt, shoes, service"" policy. Whoever forces people leave closing time..


Just add Wearing Masks list above. Here's good place insert - *No Shirt, Shoes, Mask, Service*. 

And enforce list like aways enforced. There's nothing complicated it, there's reason make complicated. mask also happens lot cheaper seems like best chance give control Democrats, despite flaws, ones taking seriously. Regardless, going long time get control. said don’t wear masks anymore starting tomorrow businesses opening back up, sounds like you’re lifting several major restrictions helping keep virus subdued.

Again, California lifted restrictions several counties Orange County, mask ban lifted near beginning June. [Look case trendline Virtually every state country significantly eased restrictions seen subsequent spike, don’t think country exception rule.

So I’ll ask again: what’s solution? right seems like it’s either stay locked indefinitely, open restrictions deal cases deaths follow. Unless there’s third option? Majority protestors wore masks. Majority Memorial Day partygoers didn’t.  Yes. typical rite aid drive thru window sent me, it, put vial, send back. test could find area didn’t require doctors referral. mission trip? Religious missionaries? Wait things open? Karen think issue honestly Sometimes, people throw fit large masks [murder Dollar Store security guard. definitely part reason many places America hesitant truly enforce masks. mean, sure, that's like. Personally, I'd probably BBQ lot, MREs thing - means. You’re raging racist hypocritical enough say hate racists injustices. Strippers take 10s Canada. US dollar really clobbering us. people per capita died Sweden anywhere EU.

No. Look all-cause mortality. Sweden quite well clearly within normal range variation. far year less deadly 2015.  part mask non physical barrier provides also fact physical barrier reduces amount exposure. I’m sure stats saying earlier intense reactions virus appear exposure. reducing amount might get infected means expect get better outcome. 

Also, might fine wouldn’t feel like piece shit best buddy got dies massively debt? infect 20 people horrible outcomes. worth trying something shows respect right live, wearing one similar respect? necessarily careful cleanliness masks. father contracted bacterial pneumonia recently, doctors thought initially COVID-19 multiple swab tests negative scan showed regular pneumonia. Though uses disposable masks, father suspects handling mask stores might contaminated it. know girl wore disposable mask couple months, sanitizing rubbing alcohol night.

People perfect neither masks. idiots stop acting like children stop treated like children. 100% right thing do. feel like people die cause bunch bros decided packing bars good idea. let freedumb ring! living WILD COVID......

like living close beehive, naked..... know began day Memorial Day? MASSIVE PROTESTS 10,000+ people!! Lol would it? Take standard boh crew 6 people getting $20 night, that's something. Hell, $20 almost full tank gas vehicle, able pay gas one tipped shift lets boh focus important things like getting health insurance, would significantly improve morale. That's point I'm making. everything handmade justify $10 burger, beef prices staying they've year, last saw like $2.05 pound Sysco, that's $0.50 per 4 oz burger, tack another $2 lettuce/tomato/onion $10 burger handful fresh hand cut fries (could easily $0.15 portion depending potato prices) that's it.

Keeping BOH like I've seen many restaurant owners pay hurts guest experience, wish owners would see that. It’s Trump surge hate subreddit keep coming back :(   Potential riots conditions worsen, surely. Especially summer heat, really want C.O right true memetic hazard Robert Wilkie, U.S. secretary Veterans Affairs, addressed COVID-19 pandemic's toll veterans on Monday, saying 9.5 million veterans country, 18,000 have tested positive and more 14,000 recovered.

The Phoenix VA Medical Center, Wilkie toured Monday, has seen increase COVID-19 patients past week. About 200 veterans 40 staff members tested positive site, equipped overflow tents outside provide additional care.

Of the 14,000 beds veteran hospitals across country, about 500 occupied COVID-19 patients, Wilkie said. Prediction: San Diego close beaches. closed bars, citing LA’s closure bars one reasons. Ha, I've joking couple weeks now. Stores need update signs with: Shirt, Shoes, Mask, Service. help yourself, sorry, sorry huge group fukin morons lead biggest moron all. Honestly, gfy. healthcare functional government. Stop complaining! need vaccine smart, sadly even close dumbest...  thoughts price Remdesivir?
Imagine served worst meal life restaurant called Café USA. staff well-intentioned ill-equipped give good meal. ingredients short supply. manager insists meals best world, second absolutely none. refuses follow restaurants prime examples even though they're actually better. restaurants serve decent sometimes good food, Café USA worst experience. worst part manager denies anything wrong!
Then finally, get bill! ticket mess! ...it's $3,201.00. personally fail see cause. hospitals (in certain states) already shown full capacity governors acting (is Texas fully shut down? Florida?). still ""more tests = cases"" propaganda. past governors overruled local mask mandates. footage inside hospitals persuade public truly crisis, means base still revolt ""illegal measures"".

Just looking ""leader's"" past behaviour, something seems whack... They've already proven they'd willing sacrifice anyone everyone extra bucks stock market. 180 quickly make sense.

Maybe that's July store us. answer. Buuut LBI Jersey shore...and bar neighbor Rumson... one top 20 richest towns country ... attendance know people ... way shape form poor. 
Edit- agreeing w op point. fact entitled people you’d come across. Referencing town many kids town go bar Agreed. sad comes back winter good amount people ignore everything. pandemic real

I'm done uh oh. Daddy's angry.  see many refusing follow Kansas I’m surprised willingness help states point. shoes, I’d looking blood sink red politicians ever obstructing agenda future. heart looks blood based poorly handled vile selfish red team shown period. Tough times way revealing true character people. RemindMe! Two months 2020 go hard go home  lol say. beloved. America think suburbs might case case thing. live work different suburbs GBA suburb grew (early 30s millennial) seems taking pretty seriously demographics appear shifted away ""people kids school"" ""people adult millennial children live home anymore whose parents starting need help days higher risk catching virus outside caretakers"".

I guess experience might anecdotal specific place grew place demographic lifecycle.

I imagine suburbs current population full young couples young kids (are many places GBA like moment? seems less common days) different story everybody might feel like they're ones risk kids ones risk.

For record, also felt nervous leaving apartment April. think shift social attitudes masks went lot farther toward making feel safe even declining rates new cases, hospitalizations, deaths. felt like virus still something changed felt like collectively able willing needed get together. people afraid US, think danger Trump poses shows rest world things look like without US. went evil empire keeping international order sorts kid eating glue recess. That’s prefaced indoors well outdoors, big one...little mask usage sight. People hanging around long periods time, outdoors indoors, minimal PPE almost 0 distancing site. think tenants none pain landlords pain COVID economic disaster comment reasonable definitely agree it. 

I agree pain spread landlords tenants, negotiate find fair way moving forward well possible  BNO took break twitter think they're back know shit's serious would agree, ones stationed near troubles India ones getting first. course ""knuckleheads"" going bars possibly thousands protesters rioters ignored social distancing wearing masks makes perfect sense me.  WTF going China? Stop BS. Except touring hospital filled sick patients  want scare population compliance ? Seems like great tactic.. 
“Some reports” - great statistic actual severity..

Let’s lock doors throw away key notice? Seems thing youre happy doing. OK 99.3. gets 100 though, I'd say go get tested, especially / definitely symptoms.

Normal range like 97.5 99.5 (or something like that, dunno exact decimals). wife teacher AZ options: smaller class, AB schedule, hybrid, full online. Parent choice first come first serve availability. It’s charter school. depends school district you’re absolutely right. I’m glad school contingencies. hope well like said students end missing Nowhere article say cause harm good. even suggested views masks political statement personally.

So yeah, president making political sign support refrain wearing mask. “That jolt feel radiation working” Another failure comment.

Then correct somebody saying ""president"" gone done exact thing? Oh God sell online I'd love buy some. sound amazing.

Hopefully approval launch shortlist thinking expatriating to? Still feel like we're taking seriously March. think maybe given cash/vouchers- maybe haven’t planned dates yet.  
Also, Legoland open (probably long). Yeah, doesn’t mean people respect them. don’t respect BLM protests message say it, it’s fine that. don’t right good reaction others.

Nobody lock-down protests *because* protests. lock-down protests stupid. ended pneumonia wouldn’t go doctor woke middle night told wife couldn’t breathe died ambulance even got there. one 14 people eating cafeteria Central Market wearing mask yesterday (Sunday) (and patio sure that's required outdoors)

One ID doctors said, ""I'm fucking ghost hunting here."" record? Cases? Sure, also twice population NY. Deaths? Unlikely. nobody dies virus new york ever california's death toll doubles immediately tomorrow stays level (also unlikely), would still take 18 months CA's per capita death toll reach new yorks. Add Fox News got future terrorist. Well President job protect general public, someone's gotta say something. Slap strategies down! saying repeatedly need stop arguing start coming solutions.

For anyone know this, American yellow school buses location based. would something like Bus 1 stops every five blocks Maple Street Division Avenue Locust Lane, Bus 2 stops... Buses broken school, usually something like grades K-5 (ages 5-10), grades 6-8 (ages 11-13), grades 9-12 (ages 14-17).

What suggesting rather Maple Street bus Mrs. Johnson's class bus, maybe pairing classes. Families tend one child, spacing often 2-3 years perhaps multi-grade cohorts possible.

What's solution? photo, holy shitballs. 2020 brings us NJ resident here. would agree concerts took place death metal shows everyone moshing pit. since case, would say gyms probably worst. lot people breathing heavily inside room heavy ventilation taking place asking trouble. really pains say since entered frail jail covid really want gyms open back up. unlike people article, knucklehead. Absolutely, abylme critique countries response, think canada great. history going remember generation for. Let get straight.

edit: remove rant ""influencer"" making people cringe? Surely not! can't afford care anymore Epidemiologists, think. 

Not agreeing disagreeing, think need lot data. US problem much higher infection rate....

We know kids getting rare circumstances get inflammatory response. 

This statement feels light facts come say “in person school important”

I hope someone analyzing existing day care centers open, perhaps performing widespread virus antibody testing schools get sense happened.  One less circus. least one less circus now. Perhaps really big one 1600 shutdown next. research created drug publicly funded. costs $10 manufacture drug.

This extortion gouging. drug *belongs people* already paid it. no-brainer people, except smoker time, significant increase would good voted increase.


We need people like Death numbers still relatively low number confirmed cases....still seems spreading like wildfire tho...very disconcerting considering areas still seem give fuck pandemic gets bad enough, even seemingly ""essential"" stores closed anyway - may well planning. international travel begins again, incoming requires 14 day quarantine. If, then, can't contact trace isolate, may well stay open anything, never going beat this.

Viruses give shit what's convenient. got better plan, I'm ears. saw that. want planet. 271 last week. Deaths typically low Sunday Monday. trend ages.

Also I've read lot drier environments air droplets remain suspended longer - something larger droplets evaporate smaller droplets quickly dry stay air longer. winter lot outdoor ventilation easy get relative humidity less 20%. really arguing you, here...but “right side” World War 1? Everyone sucked. classic Victorian politicking got hand thanks technological changes. liked Brits Germany sent unwelcomed telegram Mexico. Holy shit Mich McCuckell actually said something intelligent??? Whole country saw 348 deaths today tho so...🤷🏼‍♂️ surprised? He’s asshole entire term. seasonal places could afford another hit Yes, deaths lower. 8-10 reasons revolve fact protecting people better 3 months ago. means zero reasons get complacent let guard. 

This virus loves get complacent. pictures would. Unfortunately likely believe please continue proof. like that... least I'm not.! Didn’t talk this?

USA- 300 million people

New Zeland- 4.8 million people


Where contamination end faster? need explain. smaller population, smaller number cases deaths.

Virus spread faster places less people, meaning contamination could end even vaccine, least population number high. Assuming anti-bodies last forever, too... highly unlikely. time give hope yet. Vaccines entering trials we'll know September / October work well enough mass deployment. point 38% world's population China India. incredibly high chance zoonotic otherwise disease come two countries.

But still wanna selfish think like this: wear mask might infected possibly spreading covid people contributing pandemic, costing people jobs resulting recession. bad economy directly impacts you, family, friends, not? think, everyone wears masks everywhere, impact Covid severely mitigated, life start return normalcy amd economy begin recover. beneficial you, family friends? exercising right freedom really important present context? It’s two three weeks spike cases spike deaths. Cases going steadily due lockdowns. foolishly reopened without good reason “muh econummy”. wait two weeks watch bodies pile up. 

Get head ass.  criminally irresponsable, plain stupid since helps mutate virus making way dangerous be. clue you’re trying say addressed exactly said comment. Exactly. went doctor right gave history, guarantee would think allergies, Covid. article clearly leaving something out. 

Does husband work home? Perhaps caught first, incredibly mild case/asymptomatic, gave her. gets swabbed positive. gets swabbed negative already resolved. Yup. listened experts would’ve easily re-elected. It’s insane self destructive is, seemingly without even realizing it. Never speak children’s children childrens children’s children children’s children’s children’s children ever again! shit ain’t never gonna end declared highest level alert (PHEIC) Jan 30. absolutely warning dangers beginning. leader needs say ""if wear mask, gay"" 

thats kind backwards thinking may work. Sigh, one waiting vaccines, least Europe. false dichotomy die already? Everyone else Europe opted variation supression leading Test, Trace, Isolate everyone level sucess it. CLEARLY shown latest ECDC report: employed indefinitely require cures vaccines. Yes, local cluster outbreaks occur. happened South Korea example. always contain far anyway.

Also seeing evidence disease causes long term harm 1/3 survivors, may cause persistent infection some. least KNOW causes long term (many months long) acute infection some. Sweden likely end herd disability, herd immunity. always reckless unethical pursue herd immunity novel disease *precisely* know exactly long term sequelae durable/meaningful immunity (there still *huge* outstanding questions that). I’m hearing similar friends working hospitals. Yeah, nearly much following industries 


* Commercial Airlines
* Cargo Ships
* Truck Transportation

We're developed nation people refuse listen doctors put damn mask It’s ridiculous man. morons prolonging everything. Like yea shit mental &amp; physical health important work home. Buy fucking bands &amp; workout room. you’re telling icu nurse medical things, right. get medical education ? never thing first place 120,000+ dead Americans contrived problem. I’m going disengage you’re clearly sociopath. said pandemic strengthens argument populism comment got removed. Please stop censoring people don’t agree with. It’s immature Stupid thing could still carryout choose insisting dine nothing. virus concern causes man. Yeah, 90% stat, got probably older articles (as aware Spinraza). reason deaths increasing cases? forgot read that. here's another suggesting 45% need additional medical care. Health 'experts' 'directors' acted like exist pushing ideology ignoring large massive protest crowds. Mr. Bill Gates, Could help financially fulfill goals dreams lose business?

It said pandemic end September, reason want ask help keep company collaborators alive

[Save little still cases part process - Hospitalizations gonna start go deaths fam, that's month away. I'm pretty sure I've pointed repeatedly virus care politics. ""Open Up"" folk protest outside, BLM protest outside neither likely major point infection.  Texas heavy favorite Florida man like Tom Brady bad decisions. It’s even that. kids getting...weird. Toddlers. Human interaction outside parents part human development. *need* school.  one else gym wearing masks, needs follow Arnold Schwarzenegger's example leave. Unless wearing well-sealed N95 mask, face shield, gloves, PPE suit, exposed anything unmasked ones sneeze out. might well working crowded COVID-19 ICU, since CANNOT know crowd asymptomatic carrier.  mask reducing risk spreading something others. close enough smell B.O., close. Besides, probably cough hands grab onto use equipment anyway. People without masks public places mandate likely kinds people wipe snot sleeves care germs. wish case Sweden. surgical masks stock everywhere expensive otherwise. I've finally managed find washable fabric masks though, 22 dollars each. Seems?
If guys could see Australians seeing America seems dangerous.
Its fucken ridiculous.
I mean Australia reopen states, America exploding. Wow mean economies also don’t like hundreds thousands people get sick can’t work??? could foreseen fucking conclusion Yes. Work aggressively anti-virals 19th century style vaccination. means everyone reasonably healthy (say 60-70% population) gets deliberate low exposure something like

* 1/1000 high dose week 1
* 1/250 high dose week 2
* 1/75 high week 3
* 1/20 high week 4
* 1/5 high dose week 5
* high dose week 6
* 3x high dose week 7

Note sharing domicile people reasonably healthy group vulnerable person need isolate 8 week process. 

This obviously staggered since can't whole population getting mild cases get control within 7 weeks. likely something like 4 groups. within 7-8 mo year almost herd immunity anti-virals place. even slight restrictions monitoring virus goes nothing. 

If get exposure number around 80% need restrictions all. Almost like changing position opinion coming across new information thing...you know, thing call learning. pay able predict future? Crazy guess economy makes sense. That’s works neighborhood Twin Cities. automate even jobs, we'd care even less keeping warm bodies alive since many would longer needed great economy + stock market. look forward resources get scarce climate change either. guess I’m crediting swine flu July since pretty much June lol. Regardless, 2020 definitely sucks. wearing masks. omitted part. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* easy saying that. really hard wrap head around fact simple $1 mask far effective defense regular person employ

Aren't social distancing hand-washing still important mask? Several countries gotten new cases close zero even without mask-wearing. Widely varies many tests perform. understand many people turned away testing many sites capicity 600 tests per testing site. Numbers going testing going down. really appreciate back forth. Especially summarizing interpretation. I'm gonna go HobbitFoot's view though. I've lookout discussion. I've heard reports Japan's response majority wearing masks death rate much lower. ppl work would wear masks properly... dont want bring home cause disabled mom's death. fact Bill Gates agenda get 7 billion people vaccinated vaccine one companies backed via foundation.

This article linked short quote simply opinion Bill Gates believes deaths going down, science in. Especially studies continue show wider spread believed, immunity connected T-cells antibodies.

There link within article Bill explaining ""final hurdle""(something actually called final solution previously) convincing people use vaccine.

Everyone freedom believe Bill Gates. Everyone also freedom take advice particular person, even medical qualification billionaire.

Let downvotes vaccine undoubtedly change everything, Gates page Fauci belief one available end 2020 early 2021. According WHO, 140 vaccines currently development, reported recent weeks, already approaching Phase 3 trials. Gates believes biggest hurdle isn’t developing distributing vaccine — it’s convincing people use it.

“If it’s great vaccine, including transmission blocking, everyone benefit fact 70 80% people take vaccine,” said. “We able get herd immunity get level, really could — really exponentially — drop numbers.” extraordinarily accelerated trial period, “a challenge get safety database build confidence” people. Nevertheless, thinks people take vaccine, least enough start inching way back normalcy."" really doubt China same. blanket ban foreigners entering country right now. same, would EU nationals, would national spent 2 weeks prior EU basically ‘social media’ approach. Anyone disagree hide unfriend left people agree warped ideals day long feed. I'm sorry hard agree disagree here.

Forget 40 hours week, think average voter spends 40 hours year important issues (for record, count conspiracy affirming research time spent important issues, think fucking joke). firmly believe average voted spends 1 hour watching debate every 4 years, finds one issue resonates them, forgets everything else, heads polls.

The level delusion among populace simple things like wearing mask, vaccines, 5G firmly leads believe people begin form idea heads, go looking information supports position, decide right along, regurgitate ""research"" fact.

It's absolute joke. Sure, West Palm Beach lady stood front camera said ""I'm going citizens arrest town council Bill Gates deep state pedophile wants 5G 6ft social distancing cameras facially recognize us, also masks killing us"" may extreme fringe belief, there's lot folks dipping toes crazy pool finding water right temperature them. I'm holding MARS ATTACKS. per capita basis, we're testing amount Germany, positivity rate 10x higher.

We're fucked. really. last peak 71k tests, whereas today saw results 41k tests. tl;dr: People Trump-level stupid. Surprised see numbers going back down, hopefully that’s true trend sticks. feel skeptical considering way rising last week hopefully legit continue declining know that. asked however Volvo mentioned, ofc meant one produces *cars* *well know*. Trump's WWE entrance music... Yeah, post made angry. masks us wear *not* intended protect individual exposure, whether not. pithy remark never published. dad believes masks make breathe CO2 give pneumonia. Also believes ventilators cause deaths, things cause need ventilators. wonder someone takes time make name ""okcovidkaren"", say ""ok karen""

What fuck wrong people Texas stay home order again? saw closed bars limited restaurant capacity I'm going ventilator dawg. make excellent point. 

I went made sure facts straight, wrong timing. April 2 CDC reversed recommendation masks. Fauci stated [delay changing recommendation due 

Nowhere response mean imply America somehow knew *better.* one thing that's clear far weaker nation pretend. 

But honestly, anyone getting responsible news coverage good state leadership wearing masks since early April. Blame New York City lack supplies bad advice CDC, really can't blame Arizona, Texas Florida. Like mentioned, masks netherlands mandatory public transport, businesses manage employees working.
All I'm disappointed way people maintain social distancing, even though there's always idiots think God-given right freedom present health risk others. There's usually largelarge correlation people think speedlimits seat belts people hour low oxygen chamber. Like one fake pregnancy bellies see handle it, breathing problems. could one worst decisions make right now.

Bars restaurant coronavirus hotspots, people actually begin recognize this? USA #1! 

We best overtake Europe, several major reasons, partly density, partly age, partly tourist patterns, get hit harder per capita. 

It's frustrating. several negative preexisting conditions, also clearly major advantages Europe creating easy social distancing. we've forked it. dont stupid 14.8% positive, moving right direction? ""The U.S.’s decline started little things people got used to.""

The article already starts shifting blame onto public individuals. No, accept that. nothing decline, never got used things. think 600 taxes week livable wage? Thanks, I'm happy six figure salary. Reopening bars seems big mistake based states experienced. Seems like hold bars. probably shutting back weeks. Oh, good. yeah, I'm mind bars need shut point. pretty obvious they're center large scale spreads. entirety, it, read fair amount analysis. knowledge president power suspend constitution. ability declare national emergency gives quite powers ripe abuse, declares emergency must specify powers intends use provide updates them. president suspend Congress even. However, Trump would try benefit would work. American military uniformed services, including secret service, swear oath uphold constitution. Elections transition presidential power backbone governing system defined constitution. stand assertion pearl clutching notion Trump would try turn dictator. would shortest attempted coup history world. country would grind halt real powers run country allow that. Great, coming Santa Barbara state street shut hold block party.

Keep Covid coming arent forced shut businesses. protests definitely caused spread would illogical believe otherwise even fully support cause. But, compared countless unrelated congregations bars, clubs, concerts, stores, venues, probably small portion. Time bring Quint. Lol area, around 2% month ago.

This going bloodbath, seems like people care. Right, reason worked well. saw post 40% Americans working home, maybe people able kids home. Yes, putting people danger makes total sense. Thanks I'll check Probably small clusters sure. agree difficult dance getting ~70% natural immunity keeping economy healthcare system afloat.

Luckily ton capacity still. set gofundme hospital bills! Forum agenda pretend millions protestors across country standing shoulder shoulder weeks end nothing spread

Wonder who's funding I’m US able even get cheap white shorts like Hanes? get $4 shirt cut large wide strips tie nose mouth, double layers even. sow, fix fraying ends cutting you’re least better wash without getting totally destroyed. 

Tons ways get level protection, surgical masks quite easy manufacture compared something like ventilator. Grass roots efforts around US make masks started months ago, I’m sure countries similar opportunities produce homes small clothing brands manufacturing plants. It’s easy get supply masks N95 masks market. everywhere adopted wouldn’t find shortage, you’d find people actually able dispose daily. fancy covering use mask adds fashion easily wash. Since minimum wage went 15 stopped tipping entirely. Deliveries almost def reason. Delivery driver likely infected. packages, ""vigilant"" youd assume Anthax them, people wont usually ""crazy overkill"" well go said declared pandemic did. asked criteria met used term (as ""declare"" pandemics anymore) asked criteria was. 

The definition pandemic hard fast thing. definitions cited demonstrate. judgement call relying lot factors. said ""clearly sharp disagreement"" defended position all. think ""nitpicking"" ask justify yourself. 

As PHEIC/USA discussion, failures US federal government fault WHO. countries acted much quickly, particularly nearest China. saying thing even PHEIC declared. said repeatedly serious international emergency countries must activate disease surveillance response facilities. failures nation states heed warnings WHO's fault mind beyond me. didn’t age well lol I'm pragmatic person too, means look data evidence. inevitable large gathering sort likely lead sort spread. 

However, data shown us little evidence mass protests caused nearly amount spread predicted. [Not make money selling contrarian opinions Fox News cultists. FIFY. US control... Which... Could quite while. need anything overblown, kids' fault. Well atleast numbers going up. DeWine sleep well night knowing felt best interest citizens Ohio. steps took necessary can't say ""every city themselves"" even ""every county themselves"" one county taking seriously similar effect next unmasked infected person crowded room. end result counties take precautions would harmed counties don't. look cases, never went down: countries started open done getting thing control. understand pressures, seems like throwing away benefits gained costly lockdown. pharmaceutical drug like costs 2.5 billion research development. 70 million even 3%. completely normal early adoption. Epinephrine hand fuck right off. 1,000$ 4 shots? coincidentally color race hate It’s conformity. Masks may slow spread give divas yet another fashion item decorate bodies deep state monitoring majority compliance master plan. pandemic revealed depth culture narcissism here. America doesnt accept empathy virtue. job requires masks now. watched two seperate old men earlier today pull masks could sneeze, cough, sniffle, hack. product like nothing wrong. abruptly left area. Even people wearing masks right. cases Congress ability contain it. keep everyone safe.

And instead they're likely, ""everyone firefighters."" Holy shit. thought nature, nurture kind thing. actually wild fuck. Indoor spaces perfect breeding ground virus. governors leaders finally understand take action? Sure. think everyone acknowledges cases. everyone wears masks won’t start cascading outbreaks see now. see outbreaks among protestors Houston DC, Chicago, NYC, etc., it’s protests fault.

Things like protests one risk factor. society balance risks preventative measures. Unfortunately people seem 100% incapable taking intelligent common sense approach balancing risky behaviors positive behaviors. It’s like living budget, last night spent $100 drinks today get huge grubhub feast. might work irresponsible youth real responsibilities, grow learn balance budget saving money one place spend elsewhere.

The fact many Americans looking protests saying welp, validates need go work, get hair done, hit gym, party - without mask social distancing - demonstrates maturity 5 year old. Beyond that, it’s false premise since dip shits weren’t following protocols beforehand, either. They’re looking excuse brandish selfish behavior.

Finally, looking actions *civil disobedience* model societal expectations oxymoronic. protesting, people walk middle street shouting. That’s expect every damn day. That’s many acts civil disobedience result arrest. There’s understanding consequence, it’s important way want live every day. talk social distancing masks, trying design lifestyle maintained. Huge difference couple thousand protestors every fucking person something everyday. Imagine every day everyone walked middle street shouting they’re jealous protestors do. perhaps rethink consumer-driven economy. go playing bigoted ideas people agree you.

Instead trying understand work positive way changing behavior, belittle them, confused want anyone theorize maybe Americans forced work much entertainment taken away clubbing, going bars etc., start go crazy ? Lol...... subreddit sometimes indeed.

There may parts US fine dandy. 

But hate break you, buddy... parts US clean drinking water thing. IE Flint Michigan Water Crisis.. 

There parts US torn poverty ridden crime, police officers actually refuse patrol certain streets fears killed gangs. someone gets shot killed streets. They'll wait days even actually going ""investigate"" investigate all.. Sounds like war crime fighting. 

There millions children America die year malnutrition/starvation. Homelessness.

 ever parts US see extreme poverty crippling degrees developing nations..

Some states developed. states underdeveloped... mean developed. mean underdeveloped. simply means developing. 

You must never actually around true poverty US. Never seen first hand people access amenities would classify country developed plenty parts US.


Hate bearer bad news, buddy. America condition truly think is.

Buddy. Absolutely right, education system's flaws go goes hand-in-hand economic inequality. 

Generally better public schools expensive neighborhoods, private schools quite expensive. College education costs skyrocketed students need take massive loans.

The system change, change asap... Who? dude provide info? op? chat see giving info? said "" bills fan boys like this"" imagination ran wild. say anywhere agree op said? No, here? fuck even want talk me?
You jumped try belittle someone failed. :-) fuck off. Deliveries almost def reason. Delivery driver likely infected. package. basically pretend Anthax them, people dont do, well go  problem know herd immunity work this. Coronaviruses give full immunity sufferers, evidence exists either lengthy infectious periods reinfection, would devastating deadly disease. I'm asking question. answer it? I'm looking evidence claim 2 3 weeks cases spike deaths. I'm asking someone say ""it's obvious"". not, sometimes cases go there's lot tests done. tests equal positive cases tests equal deaths necceesarily. COVID-laden mask

I find idea laughable. idea front mask going covered layer COVID touch it, infected hand. mean fine layer COVID capable coating front mask, assume there's layer COVID settled coated everything around you, clothes, hair, skin. Step 1: Freak out

Step 2: Demand testing

Step 3: Detect cases

Step 4: Freak Auto mod removing post - short version hasn’t played infections widespread demonstrations media mask use actually widespread. could've let health experts scientist take over, once. would've saved lot lives. 

Instead, topics health heavily politicized one believes anyone anymore. awful disgusting.
 
But betting restaurant making profit due reduced capacity and/or demand. makes truly worth it. enough people think like now, healthcare system would implode. high horse. cares freedom catch covid die? guess that's ultimate freedom right there.

But still wanna selfish think like this: wear mask might infected possibly spreading covid people contributing pandemic, costing people jobs resulting recession. bad economy directly impacts you, family, friends, not? think, everyone wears masks everywhere, impact Covid severely mitigated, life start return normalcy amd economy begin recover. beneficial you, family friends? exercising right freedom really important present context? always depends scale - comparing countries see rather dramatic increase: looks gentle, interpolating weekly data daily resolution since source data weekly. Yikes guess Bill Gates would like since vaccine eugenics population control, making people secretly get microchiped. to. virus care ignore it... county, state-wide. using models previously used 99% population sick June 1? Obesity poverty.

I'm shocked. Probably helps shitload already died bad handling situation They’ll probably waiting while. Yeah dumb take, love authority, it’s whose authority trust? Can’t think another group people salivate “strongman” leaders like do. sad face overwhelming evidence Fl, AZ TX CA happening. virus go away indoor spaces full disinhibited people ideal culture medium one asymptomatic individual share aerosol fomite borne virus dozens people time. Amazingly short sighted. show wrong, that's quote book repulsive statement.

To fair, wants **chimps** implanted body? I’m sure everyone prison saying exact thing.  I'm worried last statement. might vary area, feel like people starting care less Illinois. great people starting get lazy. Maybe told people wear masks beginning. would never data this. usable data need conduct neutral settings wind, air-conditioning, movement, tone voice, activity etc effect transmission would cause data vary much would become unusable. one would ever approve experiment people intentionally infected. Even participants volunteer fully aware risk kind experiments unethical. best could hope rough estimates animal models, epidemiological research infected (especially locations cameras) air movements. going study estimates good enough much use. also virus aerosolised means would much difficult predict drops travels, especially idea threshold needed develop symptoms. solutions, weren’t followed, consequences. Tell friends follow rules maybe reopen planned.    damn right worth it

and person too....

Jesus.... Well, things could well, take korea, Japan China
All shutdowns relatively short masks seem help well. far know restaurants South Korea never even closed. seems suggest suppresing initial wave allows reopening long people take extra measures.
The problem US rampant individualism standing way extra measures. far many threads: somebody think bar/club owners!

I can't think less sympathetic group middle class actors right actually. Perhaps Marx right: professions influence mindsets. self-justify anything defend livelihoods. fact matter remains far many bar/club owners proving among selfish catastrophic actors situation.

I also think protests, even didn’t spread themselves, made people think okay totally give huge gatherings 

I’m saying think way situations different, I’ve seen lot people mindset “there protests 5k people everyone supports them, it’s okay party 100 people”

Also, think it’s telling people deny protests anything spread don’t support modifying gatherings like protests. protests didn’t contribute spread totally fine football games fans stadium long wear masks Sammmee lmfao And, know, lives Schrödinger's Pandemic!

But find sources, they'll keep believing everything hear FOX news! Indeed, everyone line right now. Every person needs take virus seriously, otherwise nearly impossible control. remind said that? sorry, wrong flair, doesn’t distract point Yes, agreed. really need mask active cases currently low 500s. distancing fine low level likelihood. 

I think Denmark probably first Nordic adopt masking. partially behaved admirably C19 response, also partially due close relationship Germany masking less mandatory. Right many Danes going Germany wear masks getting used it. also probably seeing German tourists wear masks. think helps. main reason stuck bartending last years service could tell people fuck leave abusive even annoying. cathartic experience years waiting tables. should.

Hell Google free masks area. know several businesses churches around give some. sensationalism. look charts there’s initial spike late march/early april declined lockdowns. it’s spiking again. second spike. 

you’d correct said third spike winter. Since Alberta USA?? Fuck telling haven’t been. live right outside LA. hundreds homeless camps scattered throughout entire city. Needles ground. Gang violence throughout south central. Urban kids getting left behind education system. I’m aware it.

You know what? It’s still EONS better 95% world. I'm well prepared fire house. 6 year old left gas matches, things might go pretty badly me. reporters/editors/EIC's rely politicians politically appointed executives providing readers viewers health safety information, rather scientists doctors? 

Too frequently pandemic see reporters relay words politicians readers. Often times politicians wrong, spreading mixed messages regional health officials, may read barely understood CDC post. pandemic proof positive great scientific illiteracy, yet news outlets still turn elected leaders smarter general public science, frequently leaders regurgitate bad information.

 example February ""Masks stop spread"" ""there evidence asymptomatic spread."" ""temperature checks"" help find exposed. wrong, yet parroted reporters politicians. Even February obvious masks stopped spread (thats sold out), obvious asymptomatic transmission possible, obvious temperature checks nothing. anyone paid attention reports Italy S. Korea, evidence overwhelming masked helped, people could spread without knowing it. 

Why editors demand primary sources giving medical advice actual doctors scientists?

What symptoms...no, symptoms considered covid symptoms now

any allergic reaction covid lol crowds different BLM crowds how?

How guys bar ruin weeks hundreds thousands BLM “knuckleheads” cramming together? Yeah states peaking allowed peak shutdown, delaying peak. honestly think shutdown would contained remember virus spread across globe days. ignoring millions jobs lost 1000s small businesses destroyed, untold amount mental anguish caused everyone.

I’m sure decent percentage people age range die normal year die accidents. stay home orders, I’m sure dropped significantly. 700 “young” people dying average year statistically irrelevant.  saying 5-10 percent death rate? honestly never saw anything saying high. I’ve following scientific papers content since January, don’t know felt need say can’t read numbers? I’m confused arguing, saying completely transparent Feb? somehow US fault? seems leaders took seriously time. clear data released Wuhan completely incorrect long time, Tedros fire improper handling past pandemics. refused even call pandemic far past science community said clearly pandemic situation. 

It wasn’t United States (and reddit) watching February, Tedros team. made statements shouldn’t masks useless, airlines continuing business like normal, saying completely contained China. dodged questions frequently late scheduled video meetings. completely misleading say didn’t anticipate Europe America experience problems Wuhan. problems reporting correct testing data, difficult even claim correct R0. Supply demande nothing price drug. Im 5. know contact tracing since public health/which privacy rules apply know medical settings allowed leave detailed messages HIPPA compliance. worked medical clinic allowed say were, calling for, call us back. got message unknown number might skeptical could spam. also said rich people pay less taxes false brought conclusion. many photos I've seen. trust media... always forget look test positive rate someone points out...that amount tests per positive cases damn near 15% positivity rate...

Does indeed look like “slow testing!” trick. I’m wondering we’ll see lower overall tests week try make look like it’s decline 4th? slow testing slow pandemic, bingo bongo simple happened people contracted time? decided never happened? South Carolina. college city opening Monday students let’s see turns out.... heard people comment week expect drop cases Florida trying make things look like they're improving holiday time. dismissed comments first, could occurring here? number tests much last week? Thank you. great. 
Although sudden drop data bit troubling. Ok - tests accurately detect RNA sequences, still scientific proof RNA sequences causative agent called COVID-19.

Yes is. proved way back January. 

The methods used nothing talking far.

By making 3D models covid based exactly testing for? think question fundamental whole issue?

You testing coronavirus? like, test coronavirus actually means one cannot conclude RNA gene sequences, scientists took tissue samples prepared mentioned vitro trials PCR tests finally “calibrated,” belong specific virus — case SARS-CoV-2.

Off course can. science does.

I repaat PCR nothing ever. Since nurses ask family cause death recorded? Oh, mean attacked me?

Try again. know planning use old Sears store Riverside one sight. would provide lot floor space AC. Staffing whole animal. medical bg, would ""normal"" pneunomia case patient put IC, despite probability survival? thinking fragile, sick 80 year old example? Also, opinion actually functioning, reasonable government think temporary extreme lockdown lot conducive freedom months months varying restrictions.  don’t know point want honest you. It’s scary read something country doctrine watch unfold. saw post began reading. yes exactly right. Give little time draw factual support even though totally irrelevant. guess sanity. 

Please feel free sharpen dull blade I’m always open intelligent conversation friend. feel they're trying walk fine line please sides. Yes, going 'mandated' specifically said they're going really enforce much. basically nothing change. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* go ahead keep telling people clear ego important actually getting people change behavior Hello OSHA..... Masks 100% effective stopping transmission one remotely official said are. Social distancing 100% effective, one said is. neither seat belts airbags still use protect others much can. slowly steadily

It jumped 60k 74k week 25 26. like use Denmark comparison Sweden testing nordic countries: 

Might good reminder every country (not even Nordics) pharmaceutical industry level Denmark able upscale testing quickly. like cheese. yogurt. Milk actually ages pretty well, little care. callous economic view, killing 150,000 people unfortunately creates unproductive climate fear discourages economic recovery, due far many people selfishly wanting live get hospitalized. :') 

Economically, failing understand consumers bedrock modern economy critical flaw thinking. Yes, could kill 90% world remaining assets would likely shift heirs. heirs going consumers healthy climate filled economic optimism growth. unfortunate that's life. kids learned early. area good respect wearing masks inside. I'd wager around 95-97% people required wear masks inside, wear one (children 8 required) various stores go - mostly food stores hardware store. (Outside different story I'm concerned generally social distance even relatively urban area). 3-5% wearing masks, either Latino Afro-American and, yes, White people (mostly males) wearing mask mostly minority issue. Latinos could simple ineffective communication them. Maybe fact many times work can't work home places outside wear mask. But, fact higher rates positive results minorities surprising given ancedotal evidence. BLM protests large currently medical staff know; job. go billing department, need precise codes done, requires medical staff put paper. could change depending upon given procedure goes. 

It's possible kind time-consuming back-and-forth things, completely unreasonable try others. They're banking Sahara dusts keeping hurricanes down. shall see. explain reason government cant solve problems ""just printing money""? sounds really useful.

Also put quotes around things never said though said them. explaining losses passed relatively poor. never said makes rich people bad. presumably opinion, mine. Well doubt contracted purpose virus injures body, preventing understanding? Right, that’s revoked it. likely flare situation virus went dormant experience “storm” response documented million times research already. **［June 30th OUTBREAK ALERT ］The COVID-19 pandemic situation deteriorating rapidly United States.** following 10 developed countries states United States reported new confirmed COVID-19 cases far today (will keep updating since countries U.S. states reported) :

""Prepared"" would looking shitshow China Italy January/February immediately ramping production PPE. *Ozymandias entered chat* know initially used planned use old Sears store Riverside one location. also set major Tent type sights open areas. Yes, reactionary working us well date. People understand exponential growth is.

It happen Covid: anybody know volunteer study? Maybe parents start parenting. complicated. leader gives solution, people agree comply. Everyone accepts follows strictly, first, family next community later.

So, democracy failed US case. others succeeded. controversy. utterly useless whole ordeal. hope gets removed next administration. **This AMA begin 11am EST. Please refrain answering questions guest. Thank you** I'll take chances contract tracing 1 day week. need point catching disease unknown long-term health impacts, mounting evidence long term lung damage suggestions affect multiple systems body. bad cold, fucking savage. masks protect others Covid many know have. help somewhat helping breath much air may contaminated - main purpose limit amount moisture particles coming mouth nose.

So someone wore mask comes positive, it’s likely long enough - frequent enough - exposure people wearing masks. 

So even someone sneezes directly eyes - receive less virus sneeze mask on. amount virus you’re exposed (viral load) seems make difference getting not. Well article freaked went Instagram feel bit better. article says got sick Thursday Memorial Day 21st May. 11th May posted photos took “socially distant shoot”. went tagged persons Instagram account there’s photo shoot saying “it’s hard believe three weeks ago” meaning photo shoot first week May. 

Everyone wearing mask picture, says took photos appropriate distance that’s hardly “locked down”. would personally see possible point exposure instead wondering got it. 

Clearly, AM, locked much except stress newborn getting despite best efforts. Low key fuck lady acting like infection total mystery photo shoots. knows else doing. Anyone idea testing numbers going down? Florida capacity suppressing testing somewhere? wear mask store maybe still get it. greatly reduce trips really reduce risk. I've saved much money going ordered new crank rods 383 stroker. positivity rate testing went 10% [two virus slowing down, speeding up. Thing is, hear worst worst stories, like women catcalling. hear person horror story think ""that's bad"", that's really gets you. *constant stress scrutiny* wears down.

I always tell story time one two cashiers front, Walmart, December 23rd. line went furthest back register, clothing department, turned left went back toys (the furthest department front end), turned right disappeared. time woman berating opening self checkout registers midnight (store policy, took cash 11:30 reopened 12:00). guy set empty register stared five minutes expecting jump closed register ring (was running self checkout). yelled transvestite running self checkout 3:00 AM.

Thing is, *only* bad things happened, they'd amusing stories. like everyone bad drinking story, bad vacation story, bad hobby story - laugh part otherwise fun thing big deal. constant barrage ""she put money belt panic stop sucked under"", ""she take bags carousel piled three high"", ""she complained line four people"", ""he yelled 'those lazy people outside' checking, even though they're register trained *and fucking break*"", ""another person understand card reader"", ""he argued discount can't give, item qualified, different brand, carry"", stories fun bits bad ones. They're horror absurd laugh it, true horror constant low level entitlement abuse little pay little perks job satisfaction.. *well know*

Hm, personally see trucks buses Volvo brand cars. Here’s CDC people removing masks touching mouths. Sadly spots many are. friend who’s ER nurse posted PSA yesterday friends saying many people city going around restaurants, bars, shopping knowingly sick go hosptial, saw multiple patients yesterday admitting such. straight know they’re sick like big deal cares it’s nothing 🤦🏼‍♀️ never able fully understand anti-maskers become new anti-vaxxers. There's always one. mask debate luckily moot due low covid prevalence DK moment. infection picks again, I'm hoping many new studies mask-wearing statistics around world carry commonsense guidelines fruition. even touch anything else, let’s clear: American, ashamed government (and populace) think run by, full of, total idiots.

As note, definitions cited, aren’t ‘hard’ requirements declare pandemic; said, looser requirements quite obviously met: global, rapid spread novel disease.

If loose definitions met, were, believe should’ve declare pandemic. It’s pretty simple side tracks. country necessarily waited that? No, did, *does* carry weight arena people listen wait authoritative voice sound alarms. already okay strong language calling international emergency etc, stopping declaring pandemic? It’s like couldn’t it, don’t anymore; did. March 11. 

WHO getting harangued late winter early spring this, well buttering China concealed early information. far one vitriol towards organization. ‘We’ think late/irresponsible reason. It’s clear reasons are. massive influence authoritative stances, believe should’ve declared pandemic initial loose definitions met. grew belgiuan evangelical church

Bullshit. really did, would know spell Belgian.

I see country live, Germany. Oh come NYT. dangerous message send given solid chunk country looks right now. legit cluster infections (50 here, 20 there, etc) I’d get saying don’t spread narrative want right it’s become issue get people wear cloth mask ffs. many dead babies year thanks abortion? You’re cool that? People cancer couldn’t get treatments, yet abortions continued. you’re justifying. \#4 almost ridiculous ""it looks like bra"" I've actually heard. 

I like respond ""and look like boob without one, so?"" numbers huge spikes tests performed. Similar amount tests run yesterday, 41k, resulted roughly 5k new cases..today obviously increased amount testing. Sensationalized generalizations backing proof. reddit special idiot. Health insurance criminal, forms are, least, bad deals. see outbreaks among protestors Houston DC, Chicago, NYC, etc., it’s protests fault.

I think NY protests lead outbreaks 1) already quarantined (so protestors less likely infected) 2) appreciated severity pandemic (so protestors likely wear mask). things emphatically case cities. still much known COVID yet treat like virus. definitely going hurt nation decades think clearly demonstrated contamination stays local normal talking. Thus limited amount tables distancing. Masks away table helpful prevent spread common areas people outside dining group. posted something social media importance wearing mask cousin came screaming “my husband ICU everyday testing people covid, don’t think understand?....I’m tired people telling I’m bad mom choose care family(they aren’t wearing masks public)...masks best mediocre preventing spread....I love dearly I’m tired attacked” like 👁👄👁what.the.fuck. FIRST COMPLAINT HUSBAND ICU TIME CONDUCTING COVID TESTS. actually worse today, 78,000 tests 9500+

So roughly 12% much twitter, huh? much. Assume 1 person USA chain infect 2 people average every 5 days. 

By one month 60 people it. two months 3600 people. three months 200k people. week likely today's levels. 

And that's assuming get 1. Make 1000 get bit month calm. could be, least we're numbers contact tracing becomes viable again. know situation Croatia really surprised nightclubs venues allow large crowds open summer. people return home thing, less chance superspread events like february/March netherlands carnaval.
That, hotspot infections among tourists actualy show stead disappearing background among hundred thousand infections point people need think greater good benefits well Edit: Got it. feel frustration. Sorry mix up. 0.3% population. graph U.S. Covid 19 numbers, minus NYC 
tri state area? saw one NYTimes opinion page, date. fact indoor church services held fucking crime humanity right now. Meh ... kind dreck opinion. Trying force COVID pandemic pre-existing ideology, something many us daily basis unfortunately. interested (nor really fit). victims, including vitamin D, toxic take much. According California State website 8000s almost half cases LA Well, it. % children get first place still low.

(Just factually... reason vigilant. Parents plenty overprotective kids manner things statistically unlikely happen. sure they'd give hyper-vigilance this.) 60 percent US did/does ~20 years last SARS outbreak prepare. 

Seems like lot health agencies hospitals made plans 20 years ago slowly forgot funding enforcing them. 

Here OHSU pandemic response team disbanded 2018. 💯 it’s infectious virus? really think matters anyone wants? "" need help. do. attempt psychoanalyze someone knowledge think they're wrong""

hypocrite maybe? Honestly see? COVFEFE look number tests done week compared last week. Almost 50% less tests done week positive rates going bad news. wonder feel dedicated preserving status quo becomes apparent don’t matter segment population protect?  hear recent news Russian Putin ?

Sen Paul Fauci go it. like said another thread, President Camacho realized moron immediately hired closest thing expert could find solve multiple crises affecting country. puts *several orders magnitude Trump* think people missed facetious tone comment. thought funny. fun, it’s bumpy ride zenith global power


- sincerely formal colonial super power 🇬🇧😪 ""When caution warranted"" good overview people think it: thought 2020 get worse.. Yeah, mentioned end. ac. also mask distancing enforcement. everybody afraid go hospital.

That mean system place dogshit. live went outdoor seating okay June 1 indoor 50% capacity June 10. even wait? honest, lived Louisiana, I’d weigh 5000 lbs. shit isn’t even fair. There's also reality fiscal ruin causing people willing risk lives they'd otherwise prefer avoid. August lol Well certainly. Although biggest risk seems come delivery person possibly containers. Surface contamination risk seems pretty low we've learned far best take precautions. risk transmitting food low People could die ICU beds taken, counted COVID-19 related. Hm, at? average wait time days? (don't know many people tested. Dad rural northern CA ~3 days find out?) beautiful system tho debt slavery. Keep people fear keep working, get hurt even better. Student loans, mortgage medical debt. lot people wage slaves want admit Evers won’t allowed to. challenge go state Supreme Court rule him, like shutdown orders. say mask mandate needs come GOP legislature yeah, darn selfish assholes.

-- Human Must funny choice is: kids behind year kids risk bringing deadly virus home parents school teacher. Yeah, totally send kids school. people make sick agree 100% fresh air systems key dont typically result larger systems. correct generally North America VAV system common (I say engineer based Europe understanding). large centralised system air used ventilate, heat cool space. Europe find VAV systems commonly see central air system designed ventilate space (typically 100% fresh air heat recovery via thermal wheel plate heat exchanger), heating cooling provided seperate secondary system local fan coils radiant systems chilled ceilings beams. main benefit splitting system like actually reduce size system need provide enough air around system ventilate meet cooling heating load meet water based systems dont need much space power transfer energy.

Personally think natural ventilated systems better energy perspective sides unsurmountable. reliant external tempertures prevalent wind conditions periods year low ventilation levels want current situation. Also often pulling air window accross space central atrium always air moving across occupied space potentially moving virus it.

As everything exact best way treat space dependant type builidng building dimensions. plenty buildings impossible COVID proof indoor condition rule thumb maximise room ventilation rates minimise recirculation systems much possible. lots research things like air treatment systems, HEPA filters, UV treatement etc think play secondary role. 

The crux want create safe internal spaces better designed air conditioning systems ventilation rates, tempreture humidty controlled reduce risk virus spreading. unfortuantely cant opening window (althrough means ventilation obviously beneficial case). happen like milk chunky, adds texture Yes people change long time period called habit. live Austria use masks anymore still see people trains grocery stores wearing one. also wear one im public point normal.

I using facts man. Try sometime instead hitting downvote suggesting agenda. current circumstances, yes. going shocking numbers coming week. Yes. like free. Everyone makes mistakes. They’ve done much much better large developed countries west. less I’m mistaken fact done best. I'd wager they'll end using metric like EU using air travel. country outbreak control, get participate (I'm looking U.S.). soap men's restroom. Ok, that's nasty. Hope serve food there. I'm sorry fact upsets surely protests LGBT marches impact, right? Yeah, take either steps? (Hint: answer isn’t yes) increased testing now...covid still widely circulating among population..shouldn't number confirmed new infected massive regardless? Yes, European countries belong sort federal union.

Markus Söder taking virus serious since beginning truly great job bavaria! Yep good luck getting Reddit give shit people earned worked something thought covid could still hospitalize young healthy chances surviving versus old frail. Healthy people would still occupy beds seen texas currently. 74k tests per week realy good. Sweden never tested much beginning, case surges measured them. bother? got $70m+ grant RnD. Thats tax money assume that? said, ""regular face masks,"" people around world would say surgical style masks. N95 masks totally different thing, actually considered respirators OSHA, etc. 

In event, *any* barrier another person worthwhile. Even wearing bandana feel slightly affecting breathing. That's telling made least form barrier. indeed work ways. yet concrete evidence effectiveness way coronavirus spread well understood, mixed fact severe shortage masks US time. issue Trump Republicans turned mask wearing culture war dip-shit MAGA-heads would rather flout understood life-saving safety measure \`own libs\` save lives, yeah blame scientists... 🙄 election year. makes even political dude replied said sick spending 100/meal. earth would complain way spend anywhere near that?

Thats like driving new r8 deciding take bus Im sick spending 1500/month car payments. call shame people refuse wear mask socially distance themselves. Exactly make sure sanitize hands right after. I’m sure did. pressure reopen immense withstood pretty well. think many people expressed frustration responsibly protests, damn, protests long overdue. timing...people running walking, hot, cold, crying, chanting...that’s lot people come cold flu. 

Then there’s frustration, sadness, fear uncertainty swelling many reasons. Valid reasons. 

We knew coming. 
Now, numbers aren’t weird spin up, neighbouring countries apparently much worse flu, makes excess deaths relevant?
Talk spinning narrative.

The flu usually kills people risk zone. Thisnis controversial news. Healthy people rarely die flu. Now, bad culling happened covid lot people already dead covid, think maybe flu less people available take out?
THAT works. course flu gonna habe lesser mortality rate usual. That's exactly look excess deaths. Think. written differently know of.. around care store owners customers. needs pushed harder anywhere said Required fines given. prepared - much stuff/people need move daily tasks.     
When compare places people daily basis need move hundreds kilometers ... compare places people move next village ... month get situation China plague actually hard times spread. cough, fever. super fatigue. major body aches couldn’t get bed first day. developed bit sore throat last day so. rhetorical question? two weeks parents Dr. Fauci? Since last week, every store I’ve nearly 100% mask use. Also seeing low individual regarded states i‘m really sure americans think kind better. Ppl lost jobs masses important enough mindset warrant help keep ppl afloat times absolutely securitynet. 

In EU could ask state help keep workforce make sure enough survive crisis job.
And even lost job securitynet catch you. I‘m glad i‘m states times like (or honestly times) caught pneumonia usa job health insurance, ended treating antibiotics Tractor Supply.

Thankfully lived, delerious point seeing jesus meeting dead relatives fever dreams.

Back eastern europe, would free, covered tax payments. people home country make like 800€ month, dirt poor.

The lack medical care America unbelievable thing moving here. got better healthcare Guatemala, Peru, Hungary, hell everywhere I've ever lived.

I believe richest country earth, almost died bacterial pneumonia doctor would treat without money beyond could afford pay. react correctly. *something something* america great *something something* shithole countries *something something* fake news *something someting* everyone agrees *something something* Obama's fault Vast minority *Flint, Michigan West Virginia entered chat.* different leader took different actions could gone differently.

Imagine situation would look like coordinated national effort enforced lockdowns WFH March-April-May efforts promote mask-wearing physical distancing. real tragedy US experience much could prevented minimal additional effort/measures. usual, us Gen X'ers forgotten there. truly first worse generation us. kept getting worse that.  back white. think would much easier rethink filtration quality HVAC systems re-architect buildings. Class office space already better-than-HEPA air filtering - help reduce odors particles eliminate viruses that's added bonus. 

Windows open reason. Modern buildings air tight help reduce energy usage. fact, required law regarding energy efficiency requirements would difficult create openable seals remain effective lifetime building still meeting requirements. Rural areas, western parts...I'd say 30-40% population care. Well, anyway masks common sense social distancing cheaper. It’s tough private company. allowed profitable, wouldn’t exist provide relief all. don’t know right answer is, couldn’t afford Yes, I'm also wondering seen huge surge like Florida experienced 9,000 new cases one day california experienced 8,000 cases one day...I'm curious sweden, less restrictions less pressure wear masks never huge monstrous spike like states america current Reopened currently experiencing? isn’t beat mace people, consequences. point doubt it'll drastically slow rising cases still many refuse comply wear masks. It’s cesspool anyway. Let em go Oh, means, encourage people travel states rising record breaking numbers, like Texas.

Here quote article feel applies many cities across US. make people execute? Stockholm hit hardest. managed triple number ICU beds. still weeks April barely anyone older 70 years got admitted ICU. 

A total breakdown avoided. closer call willing admit. Yes since many selfish ignorant people US mandatory mask mandate welcome. Also need enforcement fair, might answer unknown number telemarketers. excuse harassing contact tracers, though. gotta spend money make money! issue paying reasonable supply chain concepts used industries. think every jar peanut butter produced consumed? investigations though. America listen. Nothing. turn around, let run natural course. Maybe believe mirage herd immunity. death rates going slowly end 2020 year die grew belgiuan evangelical church. tried brainwash us end days told chip arm could control us, adults still believe shit. Garbage article. Written idiot.
Lockdowns wouldn’t issue given business citizens money needed thrive end.

Instead giving 3 trillion corporate parasites richest people country. mean exact reporting agency wrote Phew! That's relief. still lockdowns know know....fucking coronavirus surging ya know ""no extension expanded unemployment"" one part drives bonkers one held accountable creating power vacuum that, *to day,* killing innocent people middle east. We've easily killed million people across ocean literally benefit ourselves, *massively* fucked up.

Literally accountability. rich enough, white enough, lucky enough high government walk literally anything all. Nah. Let's quote Churchill: 

""[No one pretends democracy perfect all-wise. Indeed, said that] democracy worst form government except forms tried time time."" welcome. 4k month would nice, would literally cost 1/4 US national budget, fucking month. Pig farmers got wives kids tho real Fauci Wait, let guess, animal-to-human source unregulated poorly (same) regulated industry. order magnitude. 


But still terrible since many negatives. read “GUS us” like, fuck Gus ? Lmao exactly looking for! interesting read. see Sweden's strategy pans long run.

Many thanks! like May ages ago. 

But really, feel like ages ago. 2 months feels like forever. 2020: longest year ever. Hard draw conclusions, unless there's major second wave, Sweden seem done fairly poorly Lots words see People changed behavior regardless guidance. future well. Relaxing behavior. Sweden risk anyone future they’ve locked lot deaths anyone else. 25 cases Ireland equivalent 300 cases per day UK scaling population. ROI 1!3rd UK rate cautious international travel. even close Sweden. government basically tell people work home able social distancing human human transmission, unless pig farmer China worried. people moving outside couple months ago.  deserved criticism United States’ disastrous response Coronavirus pandemic, please keep mind handful countries worldwide capability even *remotely* accurately track number infections fatalities.

It’s coincidence global map infections resembles map GDP distribution. Case statistics Africa; Asia apart South Korea, Japan, Taiwan Singapore; well large parts South America Middle East almost meaningless. countries hard time counting population, cannot expect disease statistics anything massive undercount.

The US worse developed countries, even though official statistics make look otherwise, I’m quite certain minimum Brazil, Iran China actually far cases deaths overall. ...but Oregon part Confederacy? don’t disagree. stating hospitals making money Covid. think article explains quite sufficiently? 

There's small amount dye used 'mark' someone certain vaccination. Ink microchip. countries handled poorly usually 3rd world countries exception Sweden, strategy obviously can't compared rest world.

You'd think U.S. would manage better countries India, Russia Brazil... stanford student. ama want I'm sorry :( Things get ugly 'merica soon. Like BDSM dungeon ? know comment made think old firework desktop screensavers. feeling people actually think way. work fastfood right now. I'm disappointed fellow Americans, I'm disappointed managers allowing customers keep coming mask. slap face every employee Ah yes, chant without intellect come something better. many patients uninsured/will never pay

That's partially fault hospitals, considering many lobby/bribe M4A (which, House version, includes global budgeting hospitals would eliminate problem). Instead bailing bastards out, letting go bankrupt buying assets bankruptcy sale. done without interrupting hospital operations. Live for-profit murder healthcare, die for-profit murder healthcare. (Some pretend ""non-profit"" really act differently overtly for-profit operators.)

M4A effectively ballot months ago Democratic primary. Everyone lobbied voted murderer. Fake news One first jobs (as student, 90s they'd hire anyone knew even bit computers) help desk university's faculty law. 
 
You'd expect intelligent people - questions got...  
 
One time one professors, international expert Eastern European law, called up, furious computer start needed important document NOW! went office... turns unplugged computer plug water heater (not allowed building anyway). True, pandemic hasn’t hit USA like long, long time. wouldn’t even considered it. Well thanks trying tho! Go get rest, CDC. Take look UK's Belgium's death per capita, plenty countries handled poorly. now. really think lock downs cost money? Remember much national unity 9/11 gave many freedoms exchange “security?” let body scan us inspect shoes belts apparently putting scrap cloth mouths far. 

Then Americans got led nose war wrong people, 3,000 Americans murdered, setting two decades endless war. 130,000 die negligence Karen’s coast coast can’t stop coughing fellow citizens. 

We achieved never imagined lows. We’re lower snake’s belly. Kazmi urged public exercise caution antibodies produced Coronavirus plasma therapy offer long term protection. **These antibodies protect recovered patients three months high chances reinfection.**

What vaccine? Would something get every 3 months? really bad opinion piece trying push narrative. Fuck florida, texas arizona barley protests also mitigation protocol worth shit. can’t good faith make 421 upvotes, know mine. New York done sent assist states needed them. way supposed work equipment even personnel rotate needed State State. alas true pandamic plan failed. places like AZ 1 major accident away ICU overload Watch, eventually going get back control, gonna start seeing fucking right wing slowly start chirping re-opening.

I mean, fucking guaranteed. Also, construction older, less air sealing. air sealing, worse imagine. makes lot sense. implemented every states well countries many cases (e.g UK, Brazil, etc) state shutting back things love do, find absolutely fucking livid people ignored guidelines caused this. socially distanced religiously, worked home, see none friends, wear mask, within 6 feet another human seconds 3 months. I've declined several invitations go anything. we're back square one. Actually lot worse square one, nowhere near bad first time around March. shitload douchebags I've never met decided they're cool school need give anything rules apply them. 

I already hated people shit started. beyond pale. think I'll ever recover it, far feel fellow American. That's attributed million rather 263,000 liberal estimate. even million that's 5.5% population. Nowhere close reaching herd immunity. 99% 33% coronavirus Modern food practices, like Tyson foods, Norwegian salmon full coronavirus, Austrlian food exporters declare food corona free?

And that's get genetic, case number case export evidence pointing virus originating certain country whose president still trying cover outbreak gyms though, packed describing, example gym go even cardio machine. Damn that’s crazy tho partially agree this. don’t necessarily think opened early, definitely way quickly. One day everything shut next day everything could open. Also state government allowing local city officials mandate masks outrageous completely criminal opinion. probably would still seen rise cases level now. Also number businesses still don’t enforce masks business. Went Fry’s yesterday 75% people wore masks. It’s irresponsible. know it’s tough workers enforce this, don’t wear mask don’t go in, simple. Even like employer, report violations. 90yo relative said decades ago news used standard across board. There’s wasn’t political slant. 

I don’t know it, somehow need guidance fake news. virus hoax, cell phone towers, vaccines trackers- crazy stuff passed news. Idk one prevents fake news someone’s freedom hampered allowing lies... there’s far much misinformation- even respected papers like NYTimes &amp; WAPO. Wearing mask won’t protect you, it’s much deadlier flu, crowds inside outside bad protests magically immune, etc. Science &amp; facts back burner. fact check Trump’s tweets speeches great, seem care fact-checking stuff. 

I love Fauci, believe wrong back day lied said wearing kind mask won’t help unless you’re healthcare worker. 
He says stands behind said save masks healthcare workers. lie American public. Tell truth &amp; explain healthcare needs n95s. Don’t lie. stupid lie anyway. Nobody brain believed masks magically work wearer healthcare worker. 

We’ve got stop spinning narratives politicizing news. Truth. Science. Facts. 

Also, softening reality makes easy people ignore warnings &amp; guidance. Italy chased people &amp; made go home lockdowns. lockdown here, neighbors party street week parks packed people social distancing. people know dinner parties, visitors, etc. people going jerks enforce guidance. Italy did. life now. didn’t look us. 

Bill Gates cares world health. warn us. Nobody listened him, it’s shame. I’ll admit, thought January things would get really bad here, fact people decided pandemic they’re tired mind-boggling. trouble looking ahead I-only-give-a-shit-about-myself attitude country shocking. someone explain value Larry Kudlow added...ever? AC Oregon here. Plus, transplant SoCal... summer, AC entire day. house completely sealed. gets \*really\* hot. Major FACEPALM. someone living OC rn, already pissed off. OC people already don’t take virus seriously enough packed beaches like Huntington/Newport/Laguna early May. thinking careless people LA possibly parts socal congregating county concerns say  long dont nuclear war total environmental collapse seems unlikely humans would die out. eat anything, especially moves, really smart. might many left, ones left whats left technology salvage get early parts transitioning rougher life.

Humans arent going forget tool making, least, earth replenished habitable medium.  Second virus emerges...check Apocalypse bingo....now need ""virus crossbreed creates mutants/zombies"" lose. California cases today Australia total! Isn’t something ones personal freedom causing harm another? That’s something I’ve wondering. Let’s say 5 friends go protest, go bar after. get coronavirus 1 person bar don’t know. Also, people protests tested positive. Would attribute case bar since it’s real traceable point contact? Please Americans, beg stay murica. set foot Canada.  PEACE! really doesn't. takes like maybe one hand minimum. Maybe really dextrous flexible foot. Thanks WHO, input valuable relevant anymore anyway sad day freedom  
/s Masks protect person, yourself. infected there's reason wear mask. know infected everyone else wears mask since selfish.  also scale figure back reducing elective surgeries. USA allowed anywhere long slowly open safe country's Considering even American cops use MRAPs people, think Americans mentally comprehend concept military whose job bomb kids foreign land. Yep! much power think, state thing, better others. problem loud voice anything says guaranteed heard. Nope strongly disagree. stupid everyone else government better. I’m paranoid nut bag never left house since got back university friends going saying beaches parks getting pretty crowded.  Well morons like asshat Arizona sheriff publicly said wouldn’t enforce stay home, yeah. enforcement would dramatic step up. One things propping rage fact neither Pilot Co-Pilot contracted virus. Since neither one gotten sick, wave virus kind political stunt, followers absolutely sure wearing mask simply caving ""the others."" (What conveniently forget Pilots routinely tested, everyone daily contact. get luxury.) either one comes virus, lot ragers back -- -- bit. way, course, deafening howl we're hearing now. work education too. People quick forget adults schools too. ""Please save us money."" I'm sure that's closed. think lot renters use calculated manner. renters never intend catch due over, going ride long see free charity. result economic ruin many home owners accountable bank money. Renters move homeowners real loosers this. Crisis care standards = standards care would use crisis situation. implied they're inherently unfair absolutely unjustifiable normal situation. better regular care standards, would implement time, crises. Honest question... what's plan opening countries? point can't stay closed rest world. main confusion get lockdowns. Ashamed Arizonan here. weeks I’ve one wearing mask gym. Signs everywhere requiring staff turns blind eye mandate. Infuriating little late, Mitch! bill gates ran around telling everyone son god trashing churches might feel differently him. Spain same. required outside distancing possible. worked here. agree. wilful, start 2 weeks, 30 days, keep doubling thereafter. 60 days, 120 days, that's basically closure order. percentage lasting damages? love people apt quote CDC suits purposes, ignored story couple weeks ago highlighted two studies years ago indicates coronaviruses apt lose virulence time mutation. It’s since early May, two months data certain comes science. Something changed. agree comment quoted also voted also screamed 😂 even true protect others solution gets even better point everyone wearing mask protects us still sadly current situation America honestly sad get voted oblivion factually sound correct howin world spot world even right wrong opinion rides facts science sorry maybe strayed topic bit kinda hit feels bit 😅 I’m starting think need Defund Gyms.

It’s bad business model - never building paying high rents. tend lease gym equipment instead buying it. highly leveraged gate.

They establish subscription model dues, model assumes half members never show up. make impossibly hard cancel memberships. Five page contracts.

This pandemic first time aren’t allowed Bill people never showed anyway. losing minds - fuck em certain percentage country may actually self-correcting problem, all.  Let's hope local lockdown works. county borders open. [too many people defy spread neighbouring counties. Certain business models decimated interwebs look officially deceased — malls movies, namely. hope Sears bought stock Amazon capitalize remaining roebucks. Economist good article de facto problems outcomes due Spanish flu.

The problem pandemic was... pandemic. Even draconian measures crush region tended good ROI.

Wonder know economics?

That said, need shut nearly hard given efficacy masks running shifts etc allow social distancing.

Some industries buckle shut though - bars, clubs, tourism large part total etc Positivity rates seem going actually: right, test positivity rates would matter. know terrible situation, ""Victorian Lockdown"" sounds like crazy sex position. Last year bad. Year devastating.

God. We're going need luck get. Evacuating towns cities without spreading COVID-19 going difficult impossible hope need to.... ability treat definitely better. question know answer accounts drop. 

I guess better statistic would numbers people serious critical condition time. I've seen graph though. Lol, I've carrying pepper spray work 6 weeks now. I'm state that's halfway reasonable them. 😂😂 Make sure sweep leaves up. That’ll fix /s store partner works, ask many stubborn people wear masks store. claim medical exemption, can’t anything it. :(

The problem there’s really repercussions wearing mask, apart heckled overworked employees. makes customer service jobs even akin professional cat herders. sad consider possibility widespread mask use failing approached concept.

Wearing mask presented way protect others respect kindness. Sadly, that's connect average American days. Nice, keep good work. promise never tell another upstate joke again. Freedom juice makes ventilator go delightful way 🎵 chip implants, let post everything social media govt can’t track me. Makes sense. dummies STILL think fake Unnecessary use derogatory term. It’s 2020 dude. Get thesaurus. strange charge Bloomberg, representative party whose platform managed decline America. article, like Bloomberg, complete rubbish. hey, gotta paint bleak picture possible, right? bleeds, leads, worse try convince people things are, better Party. Nothing surprising. Still mask order, even though science says lack masks (and open beaches) causing spike. incompetence state federal gov pervasive. Hoping enough Americans see inevitable July 4th celebrations. Stay safe. fake pandemic killed half million people? 

Other people’s money? realize I’m tax payer, right? 

Also, could take teensy, tiny portion defense spending budget overinflated incredibly wasteful use provide entire country aid real pandemic.

I’m gonna block you’re disgusting person. Anyone brushed half million deaths months incredibly trashy. It’s really sad you’d rather go Chick-fil-A rather save lives, I’m glad elected officials smarter compassionate are. one think. I'm pretty sure American tourism revenue compare economic cost another full blown lock-down. Hmm u think mandate masks? mean pandemic killing many people everyday slowed u put mask let think... TIME?!?!?!?!?! week's episode internet explorer esque pandemic responses, this. That’s equivalent 600 deaths US.

Sweden’s strategy definitely lengthened outbreak, neighboring countries deaths anymore.

They’re getting similar deaths per capita US now, raging outbreak :( told ourselves

Babyboomers. Gen X here. never bought bullshit. Pretty strange leave protests wonder many people outraged ""no mask, service"" rules time support absolute right businesses refuse service ""anyone"" based owner's deeply held religious beliefs? NYPD stop enforcing social distancing mandates something like 90% violators black Hispanic. one called racist one end enforcement. volunteered end enforcement would caused blacks Hispanics disproportionately hit fines jailtime.

Would still support means police fine jail minorities greater rates lower rates compliance? according BLM, black people risk dying every time interact police.

Furthermore, BLM wanted defund and/or abolish police. would increase mask enforcement less police resources? Oh irony! Lol think would easy thing... Wear mask part... people dumb. 

I friend group chat I'm sent picture without mask on. 

Myself group members said wearing mask even feels fine, since could spreading something even know it, definitely scumbag move. 

""I worn one since beginning think guys would care""

So, harassed said he's dick potentially endangering people since well refuses get tested COVID. 

Now says he'll wear mask got uppity. 

It sucks people pushed hard something simple. 

Wear damn mask! outstanding education.

We

Slaughtered

For $$$$! numerous laws safeguards passed congress. Months ago. 


But congressional leadership (McConnell Pelosi) utterly detached reality common American , don’t know do. Restaurants people south Social distancing/masking compared NY. Also, exceeded CDC requirements going 75% capacity.

I'm sure huge list factors, NY got hit hard majority population practicing preached SD+masks.

A room full people clustered (precovid style) less 50% wearing masks AC system blowing them.

Or

Single line 1.5m-2m apart masks, 100% masks (enforced), plastic shield separating barista/cashier customers. Even AC system, would significantly reduce infections. Hurricanes. We’re gonna wild powerful hurricane season one talking yet us nerds r/tropicalweather gym isn’t effective majority people. Majority people think want gun lose weight. 

Losing weight done kitchen. want build muscle buy two dumbbells home perform almost every weight lifting exercise known man. 

The way see gyms people looking lift large weights don’t room home. tiny population people. likely design.  Yet opened public transportation... worth, I'm position although I'm 42. Ya, that's I'm worried about. see brawl happening household reason. Can’t speak AZ FL Houston protest June 2nd roughly 60,000 people. Either want wear mask help contain spread thing don't. 

When say crazy I'm talking people throwing groceries public tantrums generally acting like children. That's envision think people wear masks. 
 
I think, pandemic, there's much way gray area. Seems that:

1. respiratory virus spreading world. virus seem care hits. range providing symptoms, death. flu. people dead virus span five months die every year flu. starting look possible damn thing causes long lasting effects. 

2. Hard contain. Clearly, people going daily lives though exist best way deal this. also can't shut economy. want things open us, probably, now, socially distance, wear masks, wash hands. 

3. know end make concessions, us, accept temporary ""normal"" now. don't, overrun healthcare system, people die result, people get sick, lose health care workers etc lather rinse repeat 

There studied show mask wearing reduce transmission something like 80 percent. 

Very, medical conditions exist would cause breathing issues wearing mask. know this. used work 12 hour shifts damn things flu season. I'm incredibly claustrophobic dealt it. 

So entitled ass people country incredibly upsetting me. disheartening. look here.

I wish Us vs. leader decided make mask wearing political issue are. 

I know man. can't magically negate medical truths like, understand. lying man, nothing prove. again, need get away thinking that's problem here. isn't. anyone know latest IFR calculations are? thing hit, almost every conversation Coronavirus actual estimated IFR's, realized morning heard read term month. Yup richest country world select make riches haven’t worn one yet, don’t plan it. rarely see anyone wearing them. another state asked leave store didn’t one went another store, loss, guess don’t like money. give power person makes tacos,

You get tacos. needs fucking explain isnt aide, rent moratoriums, Fauci lied.

fuck Moscow mitch, turtle stew literally heard radio host say air good thing, guys going get herd immunity faster ""young people asymptomaticanyway"", encouraged people thing here... Nope.

Yea I've watching lot expat stuff online. mind while. stuff going final straw. first I've heard idea wearing masks order make Chinese feel bad. sounds like sarcastic made talking point make fun non-existent SJW boogeyman.

The reasoning saw initial months ""We're sure work"", ""we need health care workers"", ""only N95 mask work, might wear wrong, probably wear wrong, wasted"". first two always bit confusing, work healthcare workers, work everyone else? Again... articles talking workers, youngsters go kind places absolutely zero concern safety measures retarded ""muh freedom"" ""But im young, doesnt affect me"" mentality It’s tests aren’t available, it’s people going get tested. mobile testing bus parked nearby week haven’t seen one two people there, rest time employees chilling outside lawn chairs. Problem March/April encouraged get tested weren’t back abroad working health industry. symptoms didn’t fill criteria refused. people apparent symptoms see reason get tested. It’s shame since important detect asymptomatic carriers, can’t blame population heard first messages loud clear. Due [severe strain Sweden's healtcare amassed huge care debt: terms backlogged medical treatments/appointments terms incredibly expensive treat patients ICU long periods time. 

That ofc horrible patients ICU long time. ICU, irregardless reason, quite often hard people contribute long term damage physically mentally. first cuts MONEY since Murphy wrecked economy.

I don’t know trust anymore. Even science shady covid!(I’m looking you, Lancet) thing don’t get is, wearing mask, safe? person wearing mask die? What’s problem that? That’s good thing right? Love pathetic go response whenever someone suggests anything actually help people. “But muh stocks! rich get exponentially richer they’re slightly inconvenienced!?!” federal officials made statement church-goers stop spreading COVID-19... 


No? US there’s many hands cookie jar. want fumes indoors. would never thought hospitals US would ration masks gowns staff. beyond pale 4 months *still* this. acknowledge ""first world privilege"" assumption.  christ sakes... people choice. Many companies requiring people work home come back office.

My company working home since early march coming back office July 6th. state re-surging, county seen decline cases yet. upper management tired people working home. Various governments saying ""acting scientific basis"" Since also done U-turns covid19. clear ""government"" experts saying whatever paid say. 

Possibly that's cause ""reduced trust science"" ? /s many students going permanently left behind then? Already school districts reported 50% students weren’t even logging online classes. need adjust reality have, keep holding back get reality want.

A third parents going keep kids home anyway. US can't get control outbreak even staying home. virus dictates things now, ideology humanity? us represents humanity? dude, speak people. countries fine.  US say testing free? Young people federal officials: we're poor can't afford work.

Seriously, fuck government trying here, shift blame young order distract incompetence?

They're setting generations avoid deal public health crisis. bunch useless old fucks. Yeah that’s point... fair one really knows anything don’t understand people like Joe (and I’m fan ) pass along information mock legislators playing safe. wait! one strictest rules. seeing increases?! Oh yeah massive protests MSM said cause spike cases.... Arizona Florida? Foundations Geopolitics finest. sheep blind!! they're really behind, already ways deal - repeating grades. anybody know time Vladimir Putin speaking this? customary party's leader address larger states' conventions. 
This source ""just nuke ocean!"" People could least TRY think though... Except actually.

Using every reference there, surmise Poland falls emerging, developing. case us nothing necessarily result fewer trump voters November. Jokes people riding, requires respirator worn, cloth procedure masks adequate. plenty data proving kids don’t catch even ideal circumstances. kids start falling behind dropping out, evidence-based policy interventions shown able reverse damage. Welcome back work casino Oregon. tribe runs casino. tribe claiming sovereign nation order ignore requirement. 

So wear mask per new pandemic policy, constant state surrounded people huddled together slot machines, casually coughing everything, handing dirty money table chips also handled countless others.

I go work everyday extremely livid. yet, USA president, stills, simply give shit meat munns sick nobody workwork, stupid bossman sad now. Probably response county Oregon saying ""people color"" would exempt wear mask face discrimination something. Looks like walked back recently, though. Nice Seriously. making one trip week bare essentials staying home otherwise chance getting almost zero. people's idea hypervigilant mine. well written. Good you, making progress. fact satire would depressing future generations absolutely positive bloodline would never get continue. something here. $3,120 Repeating said different way wasn’t information asked for. tell looked up? discussing outcome enables discuss cause.

That's whole point.

You discussing anecdotally discussing statistically.

I know I'd rather listen to. go doctor blood test shows seriously deficient. think prescription cost $2.16 three months, though blood tests doctor visit cost $150. insurance may vary. 

Otherwise, get normal OTC supplement take reasonable amounts. know need check number deaths pneumonia. point lockdowns prepare this, many people thought eliminate virus. virus isn’t going away, reality now. able keep society running find ways get back normal recognizing threat stay, literally cannot stay locked indefinitely, anyone thinks infantile naïve. protests caused spike. Quit spreading false information. right! Every time gets brought everybody says “wait two weeks!”. NY seeing 10,000 cases day, also ~1000 deaths. comparison, FL yet break 100 deaths/day. 

And get downvoted like before: think still serious! don’t know one wants talk disease less severe better treating. forget washing hands. boggles mind pandemic necessitated reminders people conduct basic hygiene like *washing hands*. thought basic requirement expected everybody anyway. Nope. I’m Oregon people pissed. really looking around typically one 10 people see wearing mask about. It’s nuts I’m disappointed community. risks lives trump voters. everyone else stays inside masks numbers go down, we'll fine.  families lots innocents protecting best need work cannot protect support workforce labor get paid least.

Likewise attempt mitch pretend give shit? much less least could do. never agree policies, respect crisis, common politician important stay true values. Thats entire point here....like not. Frankly, news media feeding shit everyone gobbling up---then begging more. FUCKING IDEA many infected event, fucking idea infected beforehand, fucking idea many werent infeted. goddamn spectulation....moreso prescripted propoganda anything else.

Brains weird. fully understand them. things sometimes shit happens disease particularly punchy- kidney failure, lung destruction, blood clots- goddamn carnival options.

Considering many people get fever dreams hallucinations illnesses, ""well course, sure"" effects covid-19 cause mind hallucinations delusions.

I sorta feel like goes whole ""it's flu"" thing. think fine flu- then... maybe really sick life understand fucked be- anything goddamn fucking news. Thank :) Whatever timeframe use double takes 28 get 1 case 268 million, 29th doubling 536 million.

It takes 33 doublings get 8.5 billion.

Obviously covid would probably burn population point exponential growth gets crazy high crazy fast. reminds Tony Vlachos Survivor. going deal fact many students going permanently left behind then? Already, 50% students school districts major cities weren’t even logging online classes. Parents aren’t teachers many students, especially poorer minority students, lack physical resources infrastructure able succeed remote learning environment. see people discussing immunity passports based antibody testing... Bullshit still don’t understand example shows Fauci gave good guidance?  government prohibit sale surgical medical grade masks public.

Also, even brother wanted surgical grade mask, would impossible find one. Masks completely sold everywhere March, people couldn’t buy tried. Exactly. know drugs super expensive develop, research clinical trials. get expensive.

But R&amp;D \*all\* current clinical trials already funded taxpayers. CEO gall say they're pricing well worth. 

It's like Shkreli again. sort thing universities need attacking right now.

They also trying make time lost existing research shutdown dealing massive budget shortfalls. lot life science medical research 6-12 months behind schedule need regrow cell lines, breed new animals, recruit new patients, etc. going see least several years drastically reduced research output funding drying up. We're dropping restrictions tomorrow 😀.

Our government slowly relaxing restrictions since start June (pubs open, wear mask outside keep distance people, gatherings 500 people allowed...). Throughout month 50 new cases daily (out 10.7 million people).

This next little step way back normal seems working far. enforcement can't come paid minimum wage workers. would want worse option correct? non-coastal southeastern states also second tornado season coming up. Every Bavarian citizen eligible free test. means 13.08m people eligible. GOP: FILTHY LIBERALS WANT WEARING MASK! GOD GIVEN RIGHT WEAR ONE! REVOLT! GET AR-15S PROTECT RIGHT WEAR MASK! take what’s deplete something? This... want hope, literally can't lie myself. ""herd immunity"" number lowers people practice basic social distancing wear masks/wash hands. 20% enough return normal, we've seen far enough open ""new normal."" Netherlands,

This wrong, ranked 8th desths per capita.

Sure beginning outbreak, Netherlands ranked ""high"" number *infected*, hospitalized deaths single digits weeks.

Adjusted ""R squared"" Lol. Trump tho. Help them? Die hard GOP shills would sooner murder eat children vote way. much know progressive smart! people think universal healthcare easy student choose right career path debt relief unforeseen consequences. place like California They’ve shut (not eradicated it) now. Don’t think anyone expecting return Europe though. Outside handful lucky organised countries virus stay. Dr Fauci Surgeon General doubt spent months saying masks anything. recall something name ASCII translated 666, number beast... cost $10 dose.  need 300x recoup cost. visited Instagram page? Holy shit comment section. don’t understand people think. Funny, I'm South Originally live midwest now. locals often complain humidity summer never feel it. Case numbers super high deaths low. two week lag bunch people kick bucket? That's Crux argument I've people lot lately, thing covid-19 cause death, cause death want put 200,000 people died year last year It’s way since beginning. doctors would cringe orange talked. talk make orange angry. exactly. hate idea it, reality, done start, come together nation truly locked down, would gone would back normal. ya know....freedom 'merica. 

There could lots opportunities, especially entertainment industry helped out.  ton movies tv shows can, release them, give major, one time tax credits lost revenue help country stay home. would know it. Death rates trail FAR behind infection rates. lower death rates linked past measures. Hospitalizations want looking get accurate view you’re headed. I’m state, seen pattern like this. recommend selling stock right election. buying back drop Biden wins.

After that?????

Mind criticism Biden, market flow That's question yet. odds Mitch actually gets ousted November? people abused, prove absence racism. prove idiocy rampant.

Violating stay home order point would mean jail. Ok thanks opinion media help though public fights it. I'm NC, live there's decent chunk refuse this, law enforcement blatantly said refuse enforce it. really sad one seems give shit beyond here. kind two-fold problem, though, I've read. one hand, AC means someone talking long period time they're infected (or even breathing), viral particles accumulate room eventually breathing in. depends small space long sharing infected people.

On other, AC creates air flow and, good system, cleans air brings fresh air well. issue that, Wuhan restaurant study outbreak, viral particles breathed upstream airflow mean want sitting downstream long. proven source outbreaks. people outside flow infected persons table infected whereas people inside flow air were.

There's still debate viral particles making way system. Probably best thing outside avoid situations know more, possible, wear mask. try room open windows lots fresh air flowing cause dispersion. study many assumptions, essentially worthless. Well check logistics days. 50% extra inventory? Lol
It’s way streamlined guess concept alien you. problem. Wikipedia good articles get speed :) Used selling sensitive data foreign powers treason. Especially done even proven info used influence elections.

It may ""type"" AC system, believe high risk factor revolves around centralized AC/heaters. (Essentially shared multiple rooms/floors/bathrooms, etc.)

And ofc needs significant amount virus order circulate, similarly viral load, AC.

Bright side: scientists thier eyes topic, know enough information due time. I'd rather cautious point recurring topic since outbreak. plague? GOP went protesting life single unborn human “I don’t care die long get haircut”.

Yup. decent employer provided insurance (decent standard - meaning paying $300 monthly 4K deductible) needed MRI. insurance, going cost 8k negotiating insurance company, paid spot, hospital would charge 4K change. put credit card. Bullshit. Sweden's minimal restrictions probably maintained long, long time without serious backlash people.

Regardless, willingness follow guidelines diminishing Sweden too, much like elsewhere.

People cant sit around unemployed 6 months government pays prints money stock market. Make sure dips low last five sherriff's department said enforce it, parking lots. Reddit hates children much actually farcical. Americans hear:


Fuck America! Spread virus! Masks sheep! wash hands! Go beach! Also, 2017 article (temporarily free Harvard Bus Rev):
Why Competition Politics Industry Failing America (pdf) simply true.

Most deaths per million per day Europe currently. Social distancing guidelines helped, seen success quite literally everywhere else Europe seen lowering death rate. Tou know digital fireplace? make digital fireworks. rushing open everything back get economy moving fact set back much further. Oh also: illness death. responsibility: $200. So, ultimately paid fee.

Yes, insurance system fucked. That’s supported Bernie. headline bit sensationalized. ever worry inability detect sarcasm?

Like, surely that's you. comment easily one snarkiest I've read day, there's pile question marks. great resource. Everyone wear mask public, indoor spaces (and close proximity out-door spaces) regardless local rules regulations.

I'm glad date April 1st, CDC OSHA finally mandated mask requirements/suggestions passed states local governments - rather actively discouraging mask use amongst American public, downplaying use-fullness literal months, fear run N95 would lead shortage face-coverings. would crazy, right guys! 

What mean tomorrow *July 1st*? Life-lazting respiratory system damage, too. It’s almost like Rogan isn’t scientist one get information reliable source ... again, Americans ... suppose I’ll digress don’t like wearing mask, you’ll *hate* ventilator Except reinfection different strains. 

Even ccp admits recovered patients China get reinfected newer mutation-strains. 

You really working huh? hope understand humans already myriad different corona virus none cause kind permanent immunity. 

But thanks sharing opinion hopes rest Reddit. wish best, take care. think referring think part.

We research compliment media. Trust verify.  Crystal ball: see lot littering violations issued Nashville's future. debunked three weeks since article came let’s play along schizophrenic conspiracy theories involving three states. what, 8,000 normal amount. I’ve also read healthcare systems instructed put probable cases Covid bucket. Let’s give 10% chance erroneous labeling. we’re 7,200. Let’s give theory benefit doubt say evil states started mislabeling back March 1st, roughly 93 days article.

7200/93=77 additional deaths per day accounted for. 

In words, May, death rate still decreasing rapidly continued June. understanding is, best, highly questionable whether it’s constitutional restrict free movement states. governors would certainly challenge it, would take months Supreme Court resolve issue (it hasn’t even four months since first lockdowns began — that’s long would take Pandemic Time). practical matter, enforcement policy would impossible. infrastructure never designed though restricting travel states would ever occur future. could put National Guard checkpoints along interstate bridges tunnels, many back roads, state borders natural geographical boundaries. appreciate calm rational responses Endangering family refusing something simple wearing mask new level disgusting. Houston problem, except maybe radio work. Crazy price, child came smoothly birth &amp; wife singleroom (we paid bit private one). Total price: around 300 euros private option know that? Doesn’t directly financed, sponsor there..  r/thatHappened Yeah black people would rejoice I'm sure. LQBTQ+... didn’t happen Europe reopened. 

Even Sweden never even closed schools suffered way you’re describing Relax X43M, we've spotted lovely five-bed six bath house planet below. New roof. Pretty good galactic location... [Our cases rising like I'm hopeful 2 weeks stuff gets bad again. Maybe months easing goes badly. We've fucked hard first wave though feels like pyrrhic victory. easy mode though? It’s infuriating watching residents small beach town cautious responsible masks week long, watching towners flood parkway stroll town like there’s pandemic. know they're going manage spin nurses bad guys well, ""how dare strike pandemic"" etc. etc. mentioning management stingy pay. oral test 70% accurate.

source? thats case totally useless asymptomatic testing doesn’t “we don’t care it” rather, virus doesn’t justify major economic damage everyone wear masks social distance wash hands best possibly power thru vaccine ""We still inject people vaccines, yet deaths plummeted. Makes medical sense this."" never gave mine, fact directed source commonly accepted sub  :(  wasn't, one said that. thread I'm sure stopping chinese selling pigs slaughter. going say all, sure could care less repercussions. this. people turning bill gates ones believe FB conspiracy theory gates-chip-vaccine posts authored likely hacking lab russia. MN here, Ac. lot little countries well. even read links. They’re failed trials hydroxychloroquine. You’re proving point know popular partly fault. told people starting masks necessary. lot unsophisticated people heard message reinforced president can't unlearn it. 

I know expect result, he's good man, imo needs talk hollywood psychology/sociologists come different approach waggling finger.

This inability change mindset documented thing overcome. limited supply high demand? response assertion Swedish strategy better Norway Denmark. Wow joshin' dude. people. property owners Damn.. need look unfortunately people life think mass conspiracy. people pushing states re-open go hospitals start protesting hospitals denying care may never truly know what’s going on. doubt we’re seeing artificial extent. total catastrophic crash markets would made things terrifying. question...why beginning see hospitals currently America like Texas beginning see 100 capacity, people actually taking precautions (not everyone course, still good amount people wearing masks)..meanwhile Sweden hospitals never really surged like Americans current phase...

Why sweden hospitalizions situation never explode? beds? Less accessible treatment older people?

I'm curious America states dealing potential hospitalizion crisis taking precautions sweden extent sweden seemingly less people wearing masks less restrictions extent never hospital surge?

The dots connecting me... Yes. Somewhat test sounds it. goes wrong, go wrong. wonder many people observe guidelines. 

Will police force? seems little vague tbh. footage police india? beating people breaking quarantine We've already got high hospitalizations areas, past ""nothingburger"" already. Locking would more.

Yet Congress decided support lockdown we're left fighting masks instead fighting Congress slaughter us. Shoots self foot. Guess lucky day. Confirmed corona deaths excess deaths
... No. I'm sitting waiting room garage truck gets fixed... Chairs 6 feet apart, I'm one wearing mask whole building. cases month, worth risk ease lockdown. 🤷 Obviously home...think little.. never actual ‘lockdown’, deaths per million world statistic misleading.

We ~6k deaths, ‘only’ 2k ‘unexplained’ deaths, far cry countries, ‘hit’ entire country. compare US like did, confirmed deaths large part due one peak NYC parts getting hit, well massive unexplained death, states stopped reporting. worse say Germany, makes sense given population density, we’ve sub 10 deaths weeks now. fully agree should’ve acted 3 weeks earlier (I even said time), kicked pandemic mode sorted quite fast. response fine, timing late. least experience, people like nosey them, getting rid Facebook equivalent telling get bent slamming door face propaganda, I've seen x-rays. delusional, science denier it, man. Please mean border open, gets extended every month, I’m sure they’ll extend love idiots can’t even wear mask properly. Keep murica people believe opening phases somehow allow return life pre-covid without incurring exponential growth. virus always waiting pick left off. guess ""keep hospitals overflowing"" low bar mentality work. Man, Facebook group printing phony ADA cards going extremely busy next weeks... dude. Probably much put news. coming AC pandemic? absolutely want here. Nice apologist China post mixed bullshit lies

Nobody fucking China reached world leaders prepare pandemic

LOL guy Real tough guy. live UK, really masks here. 

But UK illegal meet households indoors. meet groups 6 outdoors. 

Honestly, still know masks work well. Maybe do, maybe don't, going studies null results. US response seem coordinated, rely fighting amongst voluntary measures like masks necessarily work well, instead things know actually work, like social distancing. 

What needed coordinated federal response, Trump laid surrendered like big baby. Find help true things. FINALLY, law that’s actually gonna make change. yeah, America suck everything. What’s new though eh? put incorrect statements multiple occasions. Recently said asymptomatic spread real. well written. Good you, making progress. New Englander here.

As side note, dropping credentials poor form argument, strikes close (if exactly) argument authority logical fallacy. Exactly. America NEVER overcome virus inherent individualist culture. Everyone thinks “me, &amp; me”. Combatting coronavirus takes community effort. takes selflessness. Mask wearing meant protect around you, yourself. 

The way see America getting vaccine. least then, herd immunity would thing. Otherwise, it’s going continue #1 cases. think Trump team effort save face (and save lives) would run ""Fight war COVID, wear mask, protect fellow american""

Fastest way get people wearing masks

* Acknowledge media often full shit completely understand trust them.

* Acknowledge science jump around wrong times.

* Acknowledge personal freedoms important see think gov erodes personal freedoms

* Acknowledge masks annoying fuck look goofy (we need folks start pumping masks nfl/NBA/designer shit)

* Acknowledge political parties trying gain power pandemic, neither care people, gross

Then talk much whole thing sucks, probably wear case work. 

Do far successful changing people's actions even pains ego I'll wait marches deaths 1,508 people Chicago including three little kids. I'll wait since BLM means something, right? What? Travelers U.S. freedom speech speak concerns?

Ohhh, right.. One really get impression average joe gave fighting virus thats becoming uncontrollable... Except Oregon, people color exempt it. circumstances beyond control

Most Global South partly this, would point OP's mention institutions population include preexisting conditions. 

For better worse, developing nations far fewer doctors nurses per capita developed world. largely reflection fast population growth, rural predominance, youth bulges. 

Now, COVID-19 ways 'great' disease Global South get hit with, due limited deadliness young populations. aforementioned issues hit hard wrong circumstances. “we”? completely agree. /one time/ payment 1200 way shape form going make meaningful impact first series lockdown March, April, May. given us bigger payments put people ease paying bills. hunkered without worry pop right back states could adequately gather supplies, hire contact tracers, improve virus response teams data overtime. needed much safety nets, temporarily, least. protests unemployed, unable pay that. Blah. feeling opened right, businesses would explode activity people felt safe unemployment stimulus bill payments, emphasis plural form, cash blow. 44 deaths compare pandemic began? Would nice see mentioned headline. Yes, compared anywhere else state much better. Anytime go store, pretty much everyone wearing mask, even always properly. know businesses require people wear masks inside. scary thing skyrocketing cases know they'll convert deaths.

Yes do. convert deaths .5% rate, giver take little. 

It's amazing everyone keeps saying ""well, maybe time different!"". Kind like people saying ""maybe country problem it"" 3 months ago. watched recently. crazy much mirrors current situation. Funny outdoor spread protests nonexistent even social distancing going outside beach end world. Fellow Oregonian here, less half people around Salem wearing masks. agree right leaning folks less likely wear masks, left blameless. know lots people simply think big deal get sick, get move on. idea, ilk ignore facts medical experts conclusions fit desired narrative

I sometimes forget Americans really dumb this. Always blows mind. dual citizens? “more likely” good enough endanger well patrons? Heard. No, doesn't. 

""should encourage general public wear masks specific situations settings"" I’m 31 reasonably healthy masked staying home, shit also clearly crapshoot generally demographic comes OK plenty cases young people getting hospitalized permanent damage, ain’t worth chief. ""We're flying blind."" CDC. “Covid-19 come, right back started from. Californiaaaaaaaaa...” 🎶 18-day old account telling us die it. building sent several notices asking people wear masks common spaces (mostly due requests, I’m prednisone, biologics low dose chemo) folks refuse. partner tried talk neighbors it, especially folks congregate make difficult access dumpsters back gate laugh say no. even person call us big brother 🙄 protesters dropping like flies now. Oh wait. Outrage cure covid Strangely enough Missouri traffic fatalities actually higher year previous years, linked people driving faster since nobody roads.

There many factors play death data definitely statistically relevant certainly Covid many things changed time going near impossible separate causes last bailout didn’t come taxes. government literally printed money. guess doesn’t fit “rich people bad” narrative though. ""Developing"" countries? roadmap developed ones (I'm looking U A) mean... drinking mask would waterboarding much true, remember braindead rednecks (my family included) going uproar every time Pres. Obama much looked direction (or wore wrong color suit, chose different mustard, greeted foreign leader polite bow respect culture, etc). 

Him requesting masks Americans would spun end freedom sort Muslim takeover, garuntee it. [Protests Seattle elsewhere don’t appear driving coronavirus surge, researchers tired hearing truth then.

Seems defensive reaction doesn’t make sense you’re telling list *good* thing instead bad thing. eat mask on? Thank you! Hahaha America best prepared hahaha yea right😂🤣 Good New Jersey, hard keep infected people coming though. Enforcing restrictions easy task. problem U.S. soil, people. people left countries, they'd take problems them. mean, perhaps test showing people walking grocery store masks get move, stuck. Well, that's probably pandemic task force would done Trump got rid them. course concerned stock market.

To honest, everything coming light Trump's connections Russia, even know stock market even re-election. honestly believe goal President United States (under direction Putin) cause much chaos possible going 2020 election.

Makes lot sense, [given educator? many years Asia wearing masks? long China advocate wearing specifically COVID? 

And world scientific research mask-effectiveness place March. check actual numbers deaths reported pneumonia flu past 2 years, see glaring disparity. hitting yearly rates deaths first 3 months outbreak. I'd tell stop listening news sources google data yourself, math, draw opinion dude. point science knowing something lying. Bad decisions lies. 

Your choice use words assumes, evidence dubious makes think know this. 

I'm simply calling people going around saying ""THe CDC liED!"" much world caught flat-footed? Yes. That's still thing lying. 

In U.S. place responsibility debacle firmly feet current administration, CDC ""lied."" presume judge UK, although impression Johnson actually catching thing made difference. federal government stealing PPE hospitals reselling profit.... Leadership boils to. United States still equipped deal fine. president madman doesn’t give shit US breaks bunch squabbling countries border control.

Certain states good job controlling it, neighboring states exact opposite, way keeping idiots away. weekly state meetings governors one point, led VP (this reported governor MA). 

A president could coordinated response final decisions announced states, terms mask rules internal lockdowns. hype train type deal. Thanks fuck shit down? bar owner culpable patrons here. Fucking Christ, anyone actually want solve problem? don’t go in, don’t.  Unfortunately, ton people still believe masks make someone sick. Shut women people. think women think required think like you? going close indoor facilities around beaches (restaurants, Starbucks, malls, etc) actually lead spreading virus?

I *really* tried hard figure masks rejected pan-Nordic fashion. It'd easier explain Sweden tbh (herd immunity requires disease spread all), nordics also reject masks. Granted, Nordics really *need* masks right now, Sweden one high burden fection. 

But WEIRD pan-Nordic consensus ""eh, masks really useful"".

They'll probably pop ITT mass downvote question fact.

One thing note experience, pattern behavior happens ANYONE becomes outspoken critic Swedish strategy. Many critical Swedes r/Sweden megathread joke it, since omnipresent many observers noticed abuse happening r/coronavirus. 

And Reddit either, happens Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, etc. basically social media platforms. least one prominent Swedish academic delete social media accounts facing weeks vile abuse, instance. level abuse one gets tends correlate high profile one is. 

This behavior seems coordinated due similar accounts attack patterns are. think likely so? might coordinating it? 

Or think many accounts patterns like might coincidence individuals behaving organically? latter, prompts kind behavior? either case done it? think video ""Plandemic"" big influence anti-mask movement?

Let Florida burn. Nope, spent adult life living there. many patients hospital 2 months due covid19, need lot new cases every day start filling wards beyond capacity.  enough patients leaving (alive dead) match patients incoming.  good point. backlog reason public health agency sweden include last 10 days showing 7 days average deaths.

Kind shame author otherwise informative article account that.  Yikes! Sweden Florida Europe. Honestly know that. ultimately biggest fuck Trump Administration. could put unified message mask wearing, social distancing, hand washing, etc. beginning portrayed everyone patriotic duty save country. Instead got mixed (at best) messaging Trump wanted bury head sand try lie away instead. don’t think people claiming didn’t get COVID, current surge cases result protests.

If protests responsible, would seen surge weeks ago. tell trump it’ll help stock market, would care? Texas exactly [most population dense - 32nd population density 15th overall deaths, definitely worse density be.

Yes, high population, also big state spread out, means spread much. I’m married child. Despite I’m still super lonely.  got sources mate? one. people think entitled anothers property hilarious. I'm curious part country live? really heard anywhere people actually stayed home ... half population yet take seriously. government ""make us stay home""? Nowhere. See Europe's curve vs - could much closer done everyone would cooperate rather whatever fuck want.  shit? Talking Italy though they're textbook case do...

If there's picture American decline, awful journalism. Europe wear face masks stay home they're sick. No, not. Taking order, bringing food, that's it.

Now I'm convinced cheap fuck hope regular restaurants.

Do actually ask grocery clerk go check back fresher lettuce? Jesus Christ. going ask too. read anywhere onset symptoms occurring one day after. Even two days rare. sure friends hanging days protest? Well right US experiencing 30k-40k cases daily. number cases doubling every 6 weeks.

Total dead....let's use makes us look bad

Total cases...let's use that, makes us look bad

Total tests...well look good there, let's report per capita test.


Right deaths look positive, can't report that...tests look positive, can't report that...ahhh infections up...pound mask stop catching coronavirus though, unless proper 3m one? US predidential elections tske place sooner. incompetent imcumbent make way someone solve crisis. understand people it, people require hospitals?? That’s pretty simple thing grasp. It’s 1:1 ratio still hospitalizations hospitals room it’s goddamn free all. ""When"" right modifier. WY facing spread thats mostly rural state accounts bars restaurants busy. 


Do think it’s people one political party going out? nationwide lockdown could’ve saved thousands. nobody wanted listen logic. would say 9th worst isn’t worst, much closer worst not. I’m sure many look total case number though Ok, sure maybe word better. 

When experts say there’s zero-risk, means room risk. say “appears,” “what know right now,” “low” means gamble involved don’t want take gamble.

My suggestion knowledge restaurants would mean familiar many us go work sick 1.) lots us dont health insurance dont access care help us improve 2.) we’re industry call out, might able pay bills possibly fired. 

In short, still chance, would much rather prefer sick people handling food. Yep. Goes back problem proud anti-intellectualism America. 

I've said allowing response divisive political topic worst thing could possibly done big players wanted way population ate found school reopening normal day august 6th. im incredibly grateful, point cases spiking higher ever, think odds schools reclose fall? im absolutely terrified happening variety reasons. agree similar. understood cases 11 prior day cases 11 ones reported. 

I pulled FHM excel sheets Adam’s github. example take 24th. report 24th it’s 343 cases. 24th 11 am. 

So cases 24th report date is
24th: 343 
25th: 1610
26th: 1699

So there’s lag too. doesn’t seem 2-3 days. course fucks correlation ECDC numbers.

Edit: report date mean excel sheet date day reported. understand me. Idk you’re perforated. Source: CDC Nothing happening Swedes, it’s mostly paid trolls propaganda sub trying change view Sweden. 

That said, Sweden many citizens, idiots like countries 🙃 safe, reliable, tested [MERS using base modifications confer new level safety. 

We vaccine level trial modified target another virus. may may work. 

And may may safe everyone.

EDIT: initially wrote comment response tweet, copied here. Removing reference tweet, comment still applies. work? 

Think way: masks don’t work wear one, piece cloth face.

If masks work wear one, saved lives.

If masks don’t work, piece cloth face.

The best outcome everyone wear mask (even they’re effective). know help reduce spread virus, wear mask. Less air. Fewer breaths. 

Less volume. Fewer objects. 

Less happiness. Fewer humans. 

Get it? water wet.. Apparently I'm late comment. There’s plenty non-cool non-friendly people well, everywhere else probably.

Keep selection bias mind. assume former girlfriend friends cool friendly foreigners, otherwise wouldn’t you. racist assholes people would probably encounter unless live look foreign.

That said, think Swedish people cool friendly. It’s shitty ones makes news. Refilling drinks job description server...

I also highly doubt tip everyone even many people go beyond.

They're utterly devoid anything resembling human decency. They've spewing simian jibbering Fox News radio decades one anything it.

If country stood anything posting Facebook registering vote, we'd building gallows. **Coughs racial slurs: HANDFUL Sweden's foreign residents reveal abuse wearing face masks** referring public/paid stuff.

You right another thing, plenty geeks reveled worlds, shut many real-life ones, hostile ""noobs"" strangers. Frankly, blame them. virus spread geographically corners country. Compare county county case map Texas April vs now. piece cotton face fuck stop it. needs N95 Respirator mask type positive effect, goes show clueless worst fear mainland-taiwan conflict leading US China launching ICBMs other. make everything else happened far 2020 looks like children's play. don’t even know you’d ever want bet that,
Jesus preventable Arizona government learned NY countries hit hard early instead heads ass people *must* Dairy Queen ice cream actually got sick day march,” said Turner. “I could move bed. bed sighing.”

This means infected March. 

She did, however, put others risk March. Hopefully others around wore masks. Haha! said that? Well collecting sending scraps make tank really tangible doesnt stop seeing friend park afterward. Plus tell vaccine wins fight, hard feel u anything hate say it, that’s almost true. can't tell Florida actual place one giant meme No. AstraZeneca working Oxford. nothing OWS, Dr. Fauci help picking right vaccine data released end year.

Look OWS. Soooo, new improved version guess. I'm going set lots fireworks illegal, since law order matter anymore. I'm rebel  Don’t worry - obv idea amount people lost homes livelihoods man. I’d look activities India involving gmo foods. like giant social experiment selection bias.... pisses end. didn’t way, fuck are. Screw public outcry people seriously still falling dumb conspiracy meme That's something need take administration. I'm you, but....yeah. think pandering. really straightforward. live DC friend town still Florida plates. DC added similar quarantine, would booted parking car outside DC home? Florida year. ""Well hey, he's president, MUST smart, MUST right""

Never blindly follow authority, always question. find sort comment kind patronizing besides point. Masks social distancing applied, completely unrealistic expect people cut contact families friends possibly losing jobs 3 months straight

Edit: clarify, I'm downplaying stupidity people reported data Florida, probably manipulated yeah Brazil similar issues US UK, though. matter plans good never going used. totally see much bigger problem US schools. Parents tend send kids school cold even flu. kid(s,) quickly pass virus staff fellow students turn bring ""science experiment"" home. 
A lot parents going like idea of, remote learning needs continue. Better inconvenienced child sick covid worse. understand point trying make, TBH. Either way, point stands - wearing mask help protect others sick, helps protect infected others. indisputable. 100% guaranteed? No, course not. Even 20%, that's worth everyone taking part in. Part problem people keep getting hung ""full protection"" written above. Full protection great, ludicrous suggest anything less worth it. others pointed thread, harm reduction key takeaway. basic hygiene foreign concept them. sub even allow posts like banned making political comments? maybe possibility vaccine overpriced, based pricing Remdesivir, instead.  oppinion, number cases really matter, number hospitalizations number deaths much important think lugging around vent hard, try iron lung!

Ourselves usual answer kind government intervention/ UBI solution working class families impacted pandemic. 

Not simply shrug shoulders tell essential workers get back menial jobs sake economy. 

Things can’t go back way before. Sure protests contributed it, can’t ascertain primary cause.

The issue news cycle changed completely, 2 weeks talk COVID protest news died people stopped caring corona. ""electric Trump, qu'est ce que c'est"" want see bar owner sue virus. also calls leadership telling lots voters things want do.

Ducey needs profiles courage moment far ain't happening. ""okay, saves economy...""  China “subject confirmation reciprocity,” meaning must lift restrictions European citizens entering China allow Chinese citizens back in.

There way China it. current Chinese standard(lockdown half million 18 cases), country open border New Zealand. (and maybe Vietnam) Drove EAV day get takeout order (while masked) -- saw couple dozen people crowding sidewalk patio outside Flatiron chilling out, masks, talking directly other's faces foot two away. maddening. I'm sure age factors this. FOMO strong one's teens 20s. I'm sympathetic something like would've really hard age, time, remember forever.

And retirees insist dining out, that's probably social outlet may understand technology (other phone) staying touch people. again, I'm sympathetic, kind mind-blowing read people 70s 80s, doubt told children grandchildren buck deal little inconvenience then, unable repeat words back themselves. No. course not. parents children knowing take care them. seems holding true, people seem forgetting human beings largely live indoors outdoors. heat drives people indoors beaches bars, heat going job stop virus? immediately forever solve problem:

Anyone opts vaccines, opts health insurance, opts triage prioritization treatment infectious diseases. Let Darwin solve problem. Umm sounds like need find somewhere else quarantine, stand sister?? Agreed, failure healthcare, failure government.

Italy forgiven west's first hit, good information coming China yet.

New York commended pulling spiral hospitals collapsed.

Every state city gets point out, result policy. lack information avoid point. Extremely concerning vaccine comes out. Hopefully Biden charge then. nothing healthcare system run business. resource acquisition allocation. fundamental problem healthcare system.

Today 12 year old girl died. Yesterday _3 year old._ Last week 20 something died literally bottle oxygen him. forget 16 year old died. friend friend -- 19 years old -- died yesterday although reported yet. collapsed healthcare system definitely _not_ run business uses fundimentally different model US. lacks resources. eventually happens almost every model. Same; illegal fireworks control everyone area really stressed worried foothills Angeles National Forest, fire risk extreme. :( There's reason they're completely banned here. need visually show stories public tell wear damn masks. God hate country. Anyone else feel like mental health gonna stay toilet know vaccine works? It’s isolation that’s hard me, it’s knowing happen. ... Meowth, that's right! Get act together, Florida. half joking. It’s like progress bar computer... you’re never quite sure it’s based time remaining number things left do... Awesome. love state handled thing part, let’s hope continues isn’t anomaly. I’m worried restaurants reopening indoors recently hold faith people continue cautious possible thought returned home abroad got virus process, subsequently giving zero percent chance survival. I’m curious, edicts generally considered unenforceable? know states like Alaska Hawaii enforced them, already state specific identification (drivers license). aren’t barring people entry, forcing quarantine. Commerce wouldn’t likely affected due work exemptions . Supreme Court ruled commerce clause such. (Oregon-Washington Railroad vs. Washington). 

Is drive unimpeded states? wouldn’t send national guard enforce major highways? optics thing? Asking honestly. think people truly grasp insidious conflict interest creates. Lol removed comment incivility. worst take I’ve seen ok website. Sincerely. Lol jfc kind can’t believe read selling highest bidder expect made elsewhere less.

The USA end paying $3000 per treatment rest world probably get penny tablet generic. literally report 76 cases coming single Michigan bar span week. Minnesota 100 cases coming two bars one weekend. think supports idea bars major source spread. ""The evil ignorance.""
-Socrates wife tells things wants. Dishes restaurants used go to. I'll make home. 

She watches like ""that's it? make whatever?"" 

""Yup.""

""Why people pay food joint easy?""

""Don't wanna dishes?"" suspect went 100,000 actual new cases/day late March. testing sickest people even hit 30,000 new cases/day, actual number cases must much higher. Stay away roommates lol comparing life threatening conditions now? know death rate untreated tuberculosis is? idea affected rest life mobility. didn’t simply test positive asymptomatic, sick months misdiagnosed time time disease progressed harmed body. That’s telling, please belittle experience isn’t yours. thoughts experiences go mine, right? Again, still unfortunately fight BLM Pride, people like unfortunately think better thoughts beliefs someone thinks differently.

And it’s also telling conveniently assuming I’m saying forced go out? said that? ludicrous forced stay inside. simply saying CHOICE, don’t believe choice? chose stay home forever. That’s choice!

I’ll say again, umpteenth time, anyone would like continue staying home live rest life recluse, free that. Let copy paste part there’s less chance you’ll pretend didn’t read pretend said otherwise:

I simply saying CHOICE umpteenth time, anyone would like continue staying home live rest life recluse, free that.

One time continue call names insult me:

I simply saying CHOICE umpteenth time, anyone would like continue staying home live rest life recluse, free that.

Maybe don’t believe freedom choice? freedom religion? freedom decide abortion? freedom love love? choice you?

Wonder insults get, creative! Trademark make money you’ll problem living life recluse forever. I’d point directly wet markets. Ah, yes, diseases problematic cause many deaths commonly shut world economies shutter businesses months time. see comparable. beat guy me. How's three fiddy sound? laws wanted go eat last couple weeks ago NY started opening places (I'm upstate, near city) like ""uh... no."" definitely ""worst"" people keep reading idea going eat dining ""opening night"" worst me.

We instead got take place ate house. easier better around. still intentions dining anytime soon like many, I'm really surprised people eager so. good maybe people realize actually harms. patient soul.... best waste time No, billions people world, know many doses required need take periodically. moment there's company alone produce number vaccine doses. So: company that's first get publicity. probably need one company us beat virus swear- right. Sorry. still leave kids home. possible. not, go store. 99 percent stores area curbside pickup allow delivery service it. There's even Amazons grocery delivery. don’t get conspiracy nuts think would US would seem advantage US would gain this.

I don’t second think deliberate act, I’m nut. want government reason something like really best candidate U.K. Masks create false sense security people stop distancing careful. Masks perfect answer, help. need combined measures well effective. late April 36k cases, June 26 45k cases testing increased substantially. insignificant percentage US population continue ""fuck"" over.

Stop blaming others. moot point basically implied Arizona population 7.3 million even 3,000 new cases day worse Italy 6,000 cases day population 60 million (aka 8 times size AZ. comment old people worry AZ laying sarcasm thick. Agreed. I'm situation family member. Can't fault someone going may years left live. wants spend locked down? still take many precautions want get sick, important see family members may much time left with. Imagine seeing whole time COVID going pass soon over? need spend time love ones it, unfortunate, sad, messed situation complicated many times COVID. Im kinda wondering one pointed fact article two weeks old now... Everyone safe absolutely get seasonal flu vaccine regional vaccine appropriate region safe you.

Any way lower hospitalizations health complications would extremely helpful.

I know article specifically addressing wanted say it. Say politicians agree take seriously. general public America same?

There could literally tigers running streets killing everybody &amp; idiots livestream clout &amp; people saying, ""I seen one neighborhood must real."" nice person. better. long immune response last? drop less-than-measurable-levels 2-3 months like many recovered covid  think ever part forecast. Evil much? entirely incorrect.

It entirely correct. H1N1pdm09 endemic flu strain. significant levels immunity it, 2013-2014 flu season 2015-2016 flu season H1N1pdm09 predominant strain. minor strain. predominant strain. many reasons. many ways it’s late. official people entertainers worn masks start, people would followed lead.

Instead modeled whining masks, that’s see supposed doing. Italian, full shit. Get lost. Death surge 2-4 weeks infection surge new cases, that’s virus progresses  knew fucking coronavirus early US still nothing, think we’re going care deadly “flu”. “It’s flu”. Also don’t ever remember anything shutting H1N1 way things covid. 

Not optimistic say least question, Europe get mass realisation USA shit hit fan? media creating ''fake news'', bad? 

&amp;#x200B;

There 250 million people US see Coronavirus news going viral Reddit?? Keep telling child. really makes difference hahaha. That's rather personal question think? nerve humans! hurting, either.  thinking something similar. Defund police, give pepper spray restaurant workers, restaurant workers legally obligated spray anyone comes without mask. Maybe trying find how/why died, since symptoms? Considering get togethers involve constant
drinking, eating snacking am, doubt masks make afternoon/evening. Maybe would use big ass empty mall stadium? Federalism likely gotta little publicity, doubt pro-COVID plague rats going go demand allowed shop maskless without paying fee claim ""condition."" Except me. Installed bidet soon saw empty toilet paper shelves. Dude saw lady talking city council Palm Beach saying wearing mask like marking us, like nazis made jews wear star sleeve.... People fucking insane. March 1898, letter brother  mega volcano Yellowstone biding time. lack leadership mind boggling.

You see AZ's leaders trying avoid this, really never cared acknowledge reality.  happens political appearances become important competence. honestly get GOP extend unemployment point. Many Americans still work. Including myself. unemployment money allowed keep paying bills. ends end July, $200 base pay help pay bills. thinking? Yes. doesn’t mean others see benefit aren’t also funding it. Considering looking long term effects virus would guaranteed. compliance recently gone down? Deaths/cases could lagging indicator. doesn't. People wear mask endangering everyone around public health menace.

Yes. makes assholes. want removed.

This genocide talk right here. #BuT TaKiNg AwAy fReEdOm BrEaTh!!# could easily took 1 hour vote names instead yea nay yelled out.

Not difficult, done purpose. Shock doctrine. like cult, religion. Dumb people finance operation. Coronavirus feels like global demonstration [Stanford Marshmallow Long-term follow-up showed subjects capable delaying gratification likely successful.

If masks lockdowns implemented early adhered to, we'd enjoying second marshmallow now. 
“The TMC ICU beds 93% capacity 31% identified COVID-19 patients.”

With new guidelines ask many 31% actual confirmed cases. data weak without real confirmation. see majority icu beds filled non-covid cases it’s unheard beds fill up. Alright threepio go ""lockdown flatten peak"" ""lockdown get vaccine""?

I heard anyone credible suggesting lockdown there's vaccine. seen world leaders suggesting it, seen doctors suggesting seen thinkers/journalists/commentators respect suggesting it.

I've seen lot people arguing *against* idea locking there's vaccine. I'm sure think they're arguing against.

Who **you** think suggesting lockdown there's vaccine? They’re cheap, effective immediately ways minimize discomfort. Wear fucking mask save everyone cost hospital stay. clearly inherent biases. It’s authoritarian vs democracy. It’s national leadership vs lack leadership. 

Examples authoritarian countries failing:
Russia
Iran 

Examples democracies succeeding:
Taiwan
New Zealand
Canada Masks too. sad leaving medical professional, resort Google. doctor explaining everything questions. even go germ infested water parks Corona. type crazies going pandemic?! thought good compared places. huge spikes NY making news, mostly prison population.

We'll see happens. mayor governor, i'd expect see report, one like it, say ""this cant nice things"" close things again. new case numbers are? European prospective, US people stupid. Damn 5g huh? prefer disinformation case. ""Lie"" non-specific, opinion. know we've huge problem sugar-coating words describing massive corruption, think word ""disinformation"" ring nefarious ""lie.""

Disinformation starts lie. proliferates, gets parroted people think telling truth stupid realize they're wrong. 

When decry lying, responsibility rests solely people malicious intent. Rubes knowingly lie, they're hook. Disinformation, hand, shared responsibility. Yes, people started lie worst, everyone else helped spread lies, knowingly unknowingly, needs accept share responsibility getting people killed. 

&amp;nbsp;

Really semantics opinion, though. say whatever want. Unless saying ""CoViD HoAx"" need shut fuck up. am. I'd love help putting many barriers trying.
It's tough see. oranges live there.

Even big orange Florida voter. First lawyer sure them. point valid getting downvoted people hate wrong. ""just wait weeks"" crowd us since early April wrong entire time, stop ignorance. cannot believe Virginia allowing full capacity bars restaurants starting tomorrow. We're next door Carolinas, going lose every inch progress we've made. It’s studies coming show relatively little protect protect others. reason wearing masks primary helpful action reducing velocity air. particles get 66% rate travel third far. makes even distance people actually providing generally much useful. would go gym pandemic, people literally spit there, exhalation exhaustion spread virus longer faster distances Lol, crying Sweden hiring private guards countries call army. GOP quickly turning self solutioning problem. think lot people seeing differently personally impacts ways they're accustomed to.

But right. we've always been.

Thousands thousands people die US every year due lack health care. offered scholarship University Nottingham. I'm torn deferring attending University September. I'm postgraduate taught, international student, one year online worth it. university announced campus still open September, concerns even more. don’t know one wants talk disease less severe better treating.

I think probably true mortality gone (mutation, social distancing leading lower viral load, higher vit levels summer, better treatment protocol), also true early know sure much. ""NY seeing 10k cases day 1000 deaths"" example misleading testing catching fewer cases now. current infected skewing younger means likely secondary transmissions (with another week lag time) older populations may well bring mortality back previous levels. event Forager part spurred calls Rochester public officials require masks businesses. drumbeat coming corners city, includes members massive medical workforce, point mounting evidence wearing masks appears effective way stop “Time city mandate masks indoor public spaces.” No, fine  Deaths still trending country people getting sick younger. Yup. Fuck guys. Revolution calling. Tell President Vice President. know, non-shithole countries, would quarantine whole district city incident. two three. week numbers start going up

depends guess live progressive city Canada people wear masks think preventative measures apply everyone else themselves...They think hoax, believe science, ask wearing, ""it outdoor"" ""It 5 minutes"" Idiocracy would improvement point...  Damn thought month life cycle. Well still could bug bomb school ones anyway. linked image asshole sounds like green new deal shit me. 

I’ll stick crude oil rehydration baths, thank you. “Personal rights” bit loaded term, isn’t it?

Are implying one side political spectrum going bars restaurants? Crowded indoor areas take mask actually eat drink? many arms two weeks thing first announced it, obvious lie...and quite starting vocal (even protesting) two week stay home order morphed 2 month stay home order. also concerns burning limited amount time population could handle lockdown early, warranted, especially rural areas. Also, start, arm waiving safe effective vaccine fall... highly doubt will.

The fact looking politicians help rather medical experts also another reason getting fucked like this... said politicians crystal ball, experts see little bit accurately future situations. look now? Stocks higher. I'm getting strong vibes Germany's early pandemic experience. Lots infections deaths main point infection young people ski resorts. Made high number infections without many deaths early on. last. talking corona vaccine, drugs used treat it. Loosely, called ""supply demand"": item high demand drive price high ""market"" (the consumers) bear. That's great things like gold; great life-saving drugs pandemic. like idea, charge hospital-billing levels dealing people without masks- $250 least. means feel exact way. enforce it? don’t lot people wear them. Totally fine Arizona Houston area capacity. Can’t lose human capitol/cattle. work restaurant people nice, still people nasty demanding tip. blows mind people nerve nasty right now. Like dare you? Here's blog post nice illustrations help explain various rates get estimated: completely agree regard changing model. Health Care country mess. see drug problem. model problem. point true?  movie stars get diagnosed recently? leave voicemail contact tracing don’t answer? problem TMC also reported would blow surge capacity two weeks announcement normal capacity. two week delay instituting public policy change seeing affect infection numbers. hospital warning last warning things going get bad.

Also, average stay ICU 3.4 days, Coronavirus patients stay weeks minimum. clear quickly. got tested yesterday notified probably 5 days automated system. weeks ago 2-3 I'm at. People starting get nervous past months. coworker here. soon opened bars husband went non stop bar hopping last couple weeks. makes worse cares senior father household sick. us work gave much shit attitude can’t locked house forever. Imagine daughter attitude? **one the** countries Europe

cool reading comprehension, bro. provide link explains since quarantined sub got deleted. blame attack free speech that. different Gonna need both. Lockdown however long mandatory masks going need place long time after. Well, article clicks fair. Feeding public fear already exists. would question whether concrete evidence transmission humans. would also think world “pandemic mode” already would make hard spread even crossed species barrier. Plus, flu strains relatively easy create vaccines short order. cares Bill Gates says this? billionaire confirming obvious reality news? He's even expert field anything like that... I'm saying crisis critically serious required unprecedented response; never happened. absolutely nothing president time. Mask compliance UK less 10%.. hell even 10% wearing properly anyway. Deaths cases still decreasing ""club"" called ""being progressive"" join us getting involved local government, getting people vote, fighting change handle elections.

Not sure live every state city people fighting need more. Personally volunteer org fighting Ranked Choice Voting state, we've made lot progress.  2 nephews Trump supporters live there. bad want get coronavirus sick enough scare them? mprnews.org may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

God damn. American hero, dude. Congrats.

Tell people die Covid many countrymen disgusting human beings care money life. spikes SD meat plants. 
But since people work aren’t “folks”. doesn’t give shit. make situation seem worse United States appear even incompetent. We're still well several European countries deaths per 100k. countries applaud squashing virus. sub idiotic. Still, US horribly mismanaged situation. gloom doom

Have taken look official confirmed U.S. numbers lately? underlying truth may ""save masks hospital workers,"" *actually said* ""masks useless."" find media stories forgotten. it’s voluntary. Maga cult zombies free roam spreading right 😂 data basing on? 

Start “testing isn’t great.” Testing sufficient show significant spikes past, now? 

What evidence protestors “getting lazier distancing masks?” would glad show tons photos masked protesters, like. 

What evidence “people contracted 4 weeks ago spreading people?” Even true, weren’t people spreading 4 weeks ago protests? virus known contagious 5 days infection.

There many holes story believable. “media talking points.” science logic. have? It’s legal he’s asking people snitch someone know quarantining. Fuck Cuomo he’s idiot. Cried Florida NY March. big difference pandering borderline state run propaganda.  one defending Fauci ""spent months unequivocally saying masks nothing people don’t need them,"" would prove anything? people do. Yes way social distance need look reality. Plus US temperature much higher compare Europe often times hot thing day Okay this: “police! Tase anyone wearing mask!”

Jk nonsense letting anyone leave deadly state pandemic potential coronavirus discussed least 17 years, since emergence SARS 2003, followed emergence MERS 2012.

From paper published Clinical Microbiology Reviews 2007:

""Coronaviruses well known undergo generic recombination, may lead new genotypes outbreaks. presence large reservoir SARS-CoV-like viruses horseshoe bats, together culture eating exotic animals southern China, time bomb. possibility reemergence SARS novel viruses animals laboratories therefore need preparedness ignored.""

Source: pg683 ""Should Ready Reemergence SARS?"" Ffs. It’s unbelievable. live Jersey, today finally active cases. people still socially distancing, wearing masks using sanitiser. people fucking irresponsible? So. You’re giving n95 masks? Cause shit normal people wearing don’t cut it.  virus clearly evolved part skill tree yet plague Inc run.  would cool feel exact way. whole thing stupid. folks observe happened h1n1 years ago. US dodged bullet well decade prepare something like happening here. 

Even late 2019 known virus made sense would end here.

If common sense applied mess first place .

A relative people managed spread mess world. try lock borders sudden people wanna go home. 

Instead holding weeks quarantine insisted going home country. Case point...New Zealand. 

People arent willing make even small adjustments life result mess go away anytime soon. honest, isn't, one attitude. health care worker, response terrifies me.

You partner doctor things.

And doctors gods.

I've met doctors who's medical understanding ended 1990s. required ongoing education choose education areas. understanding treatment risks stems pharma reps pushing medications.

This actually led development breasts boys. Doctors using medication tested adults using label way children.

There interesting Ted Talk doctor talked conflict interest doctors pharma. became really uncomfortable created disclosure movement resulted doctors threatening life. country outsources manufacturing china... sweet profits shareholders though!!! I’m trouble finding locally grown cheezits, otherwise best go local. True. Fries deep fried stuff would probably fall category. foods definitely safer others. Call 511. Live free die! Lmao. good, exactly paying “propaganda”? Well month ago everybody looked ""total deaths"", also thought weird doesnt take account size country.

And everyone saying ""USA deaths! worst country!"" (Even though somewhere around #8/#9 per-capita deaths back too.)

And people thing cases.

Almost *never* hear people saying USA actually ""not worst"" comes metric counts - per-capita deaths. rarely hear people saying USA comes European countries.

BUT going talk Sweden, badly did, sudden ""per-capita deaths"" important everyone.

It's odd. seem lot Americans need USA #1, even ""#1 worst country"". think you’re arrogant yourself. I’m showing article “suggests” possible causes. shoot like know all. gonna lie really want take Tacoma 4x4 pismo beach surf fishing.

Did Covid hit caught bunch surf perch. Arguably favorite place fish.

Instead gonna lay low weekend stay away crowds. responsible adult pandemic. Wish others would think way. Maybe folks pay rent get out. know needs see remember said that? \^  What's profession might ask? Rumors department defence use volunteers use vaccine company linked press release. combined phase 2/3 study emergency vaccine. Perhaps one them? onset symptoms death average 3 weeks, give take days. started seeing marked rise cases week ago, still 15 days see. ""Selfish business owners value money people's well being""

That's better headline Successful messaging ""well, tried, let lay idiots harden hearts."" wrong aren’t Pharma companies starting mass produce vaccines currently human trial bank fact one could one approved already large supply ready? virus slowly kills science deniers, spikes get smaller smaller. might take five years, sooner later things get better. I'm sorry many Innocents impacted wait Darwinism take willfully ignorant. mind can’t even understand concept August right now, lol. Every month felt like six months days. It’s really strange think back early March fast went normal life craziness. Yea Covid 19 Jesus fun, Satan wants go plague inc now. anything racism, no. even read article? people reacting negatively strangers wearing masks public. Tegnell flippant attitude ever since beginning this. ask possibly-controversial question here, forgive it’s ignorant: increased death counts? We’ve seen absolutely massive spike cases started 7 days ago, yet death rate still extremely low compared initial peak. doesn’t seem increased whatsoever then. I’m also curious hospitalizations - we’re increase, sure, health professionals already attributed people qho couldn’t (or wouldn’t) come treatment ailments last three months, many much, much sicker. COVID-caused hospitalizations spiking, specifically? 

So...Are lot cases much mild now? testing vastly people, realizing many people actually along? people getting tested much younger? virus losing it’s potency? What’s going on?  Didn’t say that.. trying get home without nonsense. San Francisco faring? That's good test theory, no? Northern California yes stay home ghost town. also went sti testing scary bit hospital EMPTY. expecting see packed sick dying people guess what? empty fuck. friend works hospital said never got media made seem. idk. believe see experienced made believe yeah kinda odd...... Sounds like end year Christmas time Oh sorry know job, maybe file unemployment then? Well, that's less people vaccinate right away.... first rise ignorance.

With precautions took worldwide 500 000 deaths march june covid.

Litterally MILLIONS covid victims alive permanent damage lungs, chronic fatigue syndrom, ect.

You really think ? There’s DNR that. Nothing. They've always like this.

But like anyone anyplace, many individuals fundamentally decent. believe China? Mass mostly masked.

In NH almost nobody is.

In that, I'll extrapolate ask question: red areas Cali spiking worse SF? know actually *read* articles linked reddit post?

Crazy know. read articles I'm going come admit smart enough understand scientific information gets thrown me. agree. pointing things lots people reading would get excited/get wrong idea impactful point. agree places bars truly open would case.

CA limited opening bars 1 week, shut now. limited opening allow people freely congregate, seated table seating arrangements next another party.

Masks required entry worn time weren’t seated table. point small business PPP one stimulus programs. 

But everything else pandemic team Orange screws up. article saying 4x high, saying pneumonia deaths % deaths went 8%-16% could explained lower deaths. lockdowns worked though, notice numbers going direct result that. didn’t work? Reopening like 0 threat hand pandemic over. Cases *exploded* direct result attitude, virus doesn’t fuck around. don’t take things seriously, virus will. We’re seeing right now. 

I get it. one wants restrictions told stay indoors things get control, it’s simple you’re putting it. It’s simple 98% survival rate, real threat highly contagious virus fast things spread it, it’s proven exponential growth multiple times already hasn’t even scene full 6 months. lot people get hospitalized it’s old timers, mortality rate low healthcare professionals treat care ones coming in. get overwhelmed, mortality rate skyrockets doesn’t go record breaking case numbers continue coming in. contrary, goes potentially apocalyptic levels. 

It’s shame believe reopenings actually happen done right. takes population committed safety respecting protocols place, didn’t happen time around. feel shut downs coming states nailed right now, it’s unfortunate hope people learn take seriously reopen again, safe right. Masks public, social distancing much possible, high testing effective contact tracing strong hand hygiene/sterilization allow best worlds. Spain's Magaluf (in Mallorca), extremely popular holiday destination (particularly Brits) utterly abandoned. Locals say there's nothing like since Spanish Civil War '30's. country's tourism industry  Austin, TX here. There's weird mix people taking seriously people like /u/Pharmerhill described.  Honestly leaving Facebook best decision made year thousands people running around burning looting night.

Do think people showed tests afterwards? Even UV hypothesis right, think would show data. know isn’t sole reason, need information false positives. pro golfer tested positive COVID three test come back negative within 72 hrs initial +test. [INSERT LONG (AND IRRELEVANT COVID19) COMMENT THREAD STAR WARS SEQUELS HERE]

...Saved trouble everyone! Best thing SIMPLE measures prevent one prevent other.
Wash hands time mask up. CDC misled public beginning coronavirus outbreak (which started January) April. misled public beginning coronavirus outbreak June. Either way *months*.

If link Fauci goes CDC recommendations time, let's see it. Texas cases skew significantly younger: New York: bottom second link see NY’s age breakdown. You’ll see proportionally 60 75 categories. Even Sweden's public health agency factoring days 10-14 back still 10-20% percent showing 7-day moving average, dunno do. ""Widely available"" key term here.

That coming right approval, even manufacturing ramp ups. It’s hard say. Probably state state. say lot angry students parents close again. Chicken wings pretty safe too. deep frying kill anything would touch beforehand usually taking right out, tossed sauce served. Buffalo restaurants areas people wearing masks see little risk. Well, kinda beginning putting pretty weak numbers.

Once gets gear though, look fuck out. sadly yes. literally happen town truly give shit. sad that. like calling Rotten Tomatoes bs. aggregate system, reporting counties states report. reporting themselves, passing along others report.

In case Texas, report directly counties report. That's it. * New Jersey - 1,703 per 1m dead

* Colorado - 292 per 1m dead

* Texas - 84 per 1m dead


But Texas problem article? Yeah, states counties cities federal government. States mandate things federal got can't. keep head straight. Murica fucked moment didnt care. Bad leadership takes toll too, but, know: Watch mirror guys.

a combination statements, ideas, features situation opposed one another. There’s cameras toll booths document license plates. need get government stamped document proof quarantine letting people in. sort system it’s totally possible. Well certainly wrong. You’re definitely right prevent spread closing businesses. shame, feel like don’t give much economically solution simple wearing mask. know mean? Now, know that’s lot ask people. fuck, solution fucking similar pisses Um, alternative intervention sats 65% 10L via NRB symptomatic hypoxia? money people spoken, rest country stop arguing start wearing masks. yaay! many days would go without symptoms first day possible exposure probably say never virus? 

One friends hung recently ex husband/son’s dad co worker think I’m okay far line I’m still nervous son usually dad twice week.

And virus whole time beginning end without ever even one single symptom? What's alternative? Asking people quarantine pulling draw bridge. states New York start pandemic, good move, hell would NY mirror policy?

Your anger spoiled, wealthy elites, New Yorkers. Normal New Yorkers luxuries. bet scummy people returning New York safer now, follow quarantine rules (again).

Your fight people. specific state. people exist throughout whole country, including state. They're probably fleeing NY speak time (your state's native elite residents, NY elite fled earlier NY). essentially graphing positivity rate? definitely paints brighter picture, mean much without raw numbers. course we're never going get 30% positive rate tests again, indicate testing enough. 😂 damn idiots, medical resources wasted people get virus. Let fight own. masks make someone sick? piece cloth? Yeah, nothing like cat 5 spice things up. Well yeah. need lot better it. Doesn’t help you’ve got childish, defiant act people much like recent leader “Reopen Maryland” protests getting diagnosed COVID-19 refusing cooperate contact tracing efforts.

I’m beyond sick done it’s even funny. We’ve got one blame ourselves, spearheaded anti mask pro reopening pandemic much like said Maryland hero blame huge part burden. Damn, comments like make realize you’re interested objectivity are. idea. job solve dilemma. That's one difficult questions comes parent.

I guess we've really devolved though, thought parents would choose protect children. many people LA wearing chin, nose. even understand trying say there. 

Cases lot throughout south west. denying something? they’re buying 3M. Okay. 


Hmm... 


🤔 think understand said. mid may worst case memorial day 100K total cases. we've blown may hit number every single day. Yeah, almost like he’s doctor cares people’s lives King County WA issued mask order 6 weeks ago.

Since order 3 day average cases doubled.

Can anybody explain that? would work record people likely test positive congregating indoors.

Maybe try following science instead contrarian? Strongly recommend this. thing miss facebook occasional invite party. question isnt ""Is COVID super communicable dangerous not?"" ""Is COVID likely spread outdoors, even social distancing lax?"" 

You can't use outdoor event extrapolate virus's contagiousness indoors. send protesters bunch bars, nightmare hands. Misleading headline. rolling back things different announced it. Sound familiar? 

Soon, US company #1 seller remdesivir. 

It's cycle again. governors outbid federal government order secure life-saving drug? already priced $3k, that's insured!

The CDC doesn’t anyone China neither WHO. China already proven slow deceitful comes alerting world ongoing epidemics. don’t even know many people country sick dead COVID. 

What worries China exact thing virus winter COVID. They’ll lie, cover up, try minimize world’s concerns. 

They 0 credibility far tell, take word China says virus isn’t immediate threat. guess think person able walk store without paying also. seatbelt violation California $162 can’t mask violation $100? There’s excuse wear mask they’re sold cheap everywhere don’t want DIY one alternate universe Corona US control? 2 months lead time enough.

Also x masks needed public. Funny, thought headline mentions much bread save top comment immediately mentions many lives president could save wore mask Quarantine people working pigs.

Every health care system become overwhelmed. Doctors, beds supplies infinite system.  Death lagging indicator. Young people getting sick ok less likely die. still use healthcare resources still know long term effects. Relax, flu. correct.

I'm technically medical professional work psychology Thanks. It’s frustrating see people say stuff literally experience field. bar owners don’t make killing. devastating family financially. put risk new project working also. 

We probably eek significant pay cut, longer hours me, firing staff, small loans. 

I’m going protesting bar closed, get man. really do. deaths significantly lag (and complications even lot people die). 

if wait death rate skyrockets, late. take measures that. Pay attention United States. future beginning August allow states force kids back school really warning already know care?

So, idiot, like think vaccine question as:

1. actually effective vaccine?
2. so, get quicker typically expected?

Northern states face test winter don’t wonderful 70-80F weather keep us occupied outdoor activities, instead forced indoors need indoor heating reprieve winter weather. Yeah, Riverside county already 99% ICU capacity. :( really think we're overlooking #1. Much spike probably due young people going reopened bars generally socializing again. recent super spreader events seem bars clubs, earlier pandemic church choirs, funerals, intergenerational gatherings.

A 60 year old guy reopened state care pandemic might go restaurant wife take trip hardware store without mask.

A 25 year old guy reopened state care COVID likely go crowded college bar rowdy house party. Maybe hooks girl meets bar hopping. Maybe he's sharing bong party.

They're dumb guys, based age they're going potentially impact vastly different number people unknowingly COVID positive.

This would lead high case totals low death rates - young people generally healthy equipped fight virus (though obviously nothing sure thing) based lifestyles also encountering wider variety people infect.

I'm wholesale business. customers businesses public come in. public problem. business owners employees come wear mask pleasure business them. want cop public can't learn behave may close public again. strange situation important get distribution begins stage, that’s vaccine likely success, also vulnerable population frontline workers get vaccine stage.

The world dragged around one country’s retarded rednecks. friend, look case numbers trending. Look jumps week past 4 weeks alone, realize even actions taken pooch already screwed next weeks comes cases, realize we’re barely thing stop outbreaking states. 

It’s probable case within 4 weeks trend stop. Case numbers absolutely exploding it’s growing exponentially. We’re very, big trouble already it’s going get lot worse unless start correcting like yesterday follow rules road, mean others not. know find study? able locate it. weird surprise. Someone also DK like good friend OP. also coincidentally shows whenever he's downvoted thank efforts, also coincidentally shits Sweden every post. 

It's massive massive coincidence. got point 160 million infected, death toll would unfathomable. death rate would much higher 0.5%. Hospitals would completely collapse, people would die home.  transporting Iowa think call ventilation shutdown right. ut yea they're really hot building like hour half die. they're burned alive. they're heated death. misspoke would threaten president’s ego delusions are.

Fuck America, let burn ash comment objectively funny. Where’s show it’s deadly? Death rate seems even lower many northern states. ? I'm fascinated relatively quickly national mentality changed. WW2 generation sacrificed much collective good - scrap drives, ration cards, price controls, shortages raw material war drive enlisting service. generation called almost nothing - masks stay home possible - many lose collective minds. Ikr deleted account years ago never missed it. constant source stress anxiety. Can't even imagine cesspool pandemic please stop excusing behaviors (including protests) fit favorite narrative? protests, packed beaches, “My freedoms” Karens, parades, we’re killing people. outside / inside defenders forget social distancing rules. “My Freedoms” defenders think private property can’t set dress rules (including masks). 

Don’t get started seems find people wearing mask wearing incorrectly wearing nose mouth.

Call. Them. All. Out. two regions reason increases State cases? Entirely possible different states different reasons issues.

This article talking California, I’m mostly referring CA. things largely open outside small areas still mostly small problems people pretty good wearing masks.

This guy states “our luck ran out” so, yea, it’s wonder. countries mentioned also reduction cases last months. much US Yep 3.... getting ridiculous, protests absolutely spread virus , among many things spread it. need implant us know people doing. share everything multiple devices smart watches smart appliances plus apps like facebook, twitter, tik tok etc.

businesses already access info anylized heck know think, feel, vote, buy get want. targeted advertizing more.

why waste time expense chipping people happily share every detail life facebook? Curious suddenly affecting mostly young people months ago...   Sub refuses accept Europe little masks usage. Many nations Sub praises still discouraging them. mask mandates removed (Austria) much weaker mandates US (People think everybody Paris masked utter nonsense).


Mask usage contact tracing Europe numbers went down. Okay, data counter argument. least explanation peak cases supposedly caused protests happening 2 weeks happening, according everything know virus’s incubation period? think whole group White House tried treason point. terrible watch happen, VP say 'we flattened curve'..the NE flattened curve little help them, listed them, ground zero mean level agree you. 

The problem longer rational actors. They’ve staked entire political run irrational kneejerk rhetoric. 

In normal climate I’d agree, don’t think there’s lot room right now. Hopefully get again. lmaooo good question. I’ll lab rat feel like enevitable I'll get worksite eventually. th chance get infected science, doctor's looking I'd take heartbeat. People dont care anymore, every single part government absolutely fucked response. Right now, stay inside high risk, arent whatever want, one cares anymore. thing place Seattle. Customers understanding putting staff others risk closed dining room Interesting. Thanks intelligent response. I'm surprised hear discussed much anymore. need read press release.

people also wary press releases without real data people look at.

And people need weary study like looked results 36 people, divided two groups 18 (for different doses). includes young people.

and people need realize tested T-cells, whether people immune. Cloth face masks actually considered PPE. do. deserve tips. post crap every article? “Idaho immediately available comment.”

I don’t know found funny. It’s possible, it’s 100% we’re heading within weeks actions aren’t taken stop bleeding NOW. Exponential growth doesn’t fuck around think really interesting. You’d think would start spike hasn’t. Seems odd. correalation amount weed smoked Austin resistance CV. great lab. We're gonna die we? Feels inevitable point. need I'll crowded bar licking every surface. Yes, I'm including humans surfaces. It’s 20%, fear. data showing people still coming greater numbers protests? I’d love see it.

Edit: going link data downvote? want die? commentators pointed conviently left working photographer also. yeah ""hyperviligent"" says. Ah. Boy face red, 4.7 million served, population. stupidity MUST stop. reported 600 cases yesterday due late data makes sense. Yeah thinking maybe Americans finally get behind .. 4 months late, yeah. That’s insane. tell take something fatty calcium?   protests ok.. socially distant all, wearing masks. 

Insane close beaches they’ve already opened worms.   trying presidents job?! Kansas governor blue. Iowa's red. Iowa even issue stay home orders ever? I'm MO stay home less month way Parson ever mandate masks. Luckily city mayor cares more, immediate environment controlled via government ordinances rest state. Yes frightening many office buildings, commercial buildings, even hotels non-opening windows windows open inch so. Time major rethink architects perhaps. call anyone idiot? thing they're cows areas? read something injecting something making antibodies compatible humans could reproduced massive rate attitude Pence Trump tho. Embarrassing enough here's saying, well, ideal, looking like quite catastrophe supposed either, least possibility allowing mostly avoid subsequent waves. Testing US since previous peak. testing far young people mild cases, better protecting at-risk population, much better treatment April. addition, lag cases deaths, recent exponential growth reflected deaths yet. 

You mostly correct deaths: [7-day 593) deaths 593, lowest since March. However, data showing signs stagnation - 7 day average remained pretty much constant last 3 days. Serious critical cases also slightly gone up. given death's door. lower 8 point scale drug starts, better works.

misread last column. bad. full article talk statistical significance results though, especially compared studies signficant results week ago said masks weren’t needed healthy? Maybe go live China coronavirus likes Probably helped every news article headline ""its terrifying "" ""its scary "" it. Including one. knew exactly wanted it. said federal stockpile PPE states, intercepted state's purchases PPE, sent newly form company run friend family made states bid like fucking auction.

He wanted make money cost lives. spreads less readily still does, especially people socially distancing and/or wearing masks. Me, me, me, mentality. really need get that. pay high taxes grumble good infrastructure services use every day. I'm road someone makes mistake think, hey, he's paying taxes pay beautiful roadway infrastructure, let's cut slack, not, make mofo pay! No. Trump reading, bleach says ""drink me"" Lmao printed advisory attached hefty fine. US states.

[Texas closed schools businesses March Florida closed schools [in mid-March](http://www.fldoe.org/em-response/) non-essential businesses [the first week California closed schools [in early businesses shut [in late 

These three states biggest increases right now, shut time Europe did. States like New York ordered [mandatory mask use fully shutting [in NY leads US cases deaths; wrong?

People seem ignoring two things; first, reopening following spike [in countries [in Hell, [WHO already predicting happen across rest Europe seems less inevitable. brings second point: whole point shutdowns contain spread way allowed hospitals overwhelmed Italy’s were. We’ve told Fauci, CDC, it’s likely majority world get this; experts (mostly Chinese scientists) even saying predict become [another seasonal Shutting fully opening back doesn’t work can’t stay shut forever. People going get tired wearing masks, young kids aren’t going social distance well, humans general social creatures going trouble living like months years come.

So what’s solution exactly? soon (the Czech Republic, you) opens fully masks you’re going see spike cases. Based available statistics, data, professional commentary happen. I’m pretending answer, doesn’t look like one. Gosh, Aus 7,834 cases total date start. Hard fathom many day California.

Don't say spread probably similar Cal.

**Population** 

Sydney 5.2 million AUS

Melbourne 4.9 million AUS

Los Angles 4 million CAL

Brisbane 2.4 million AUS

Perth 2 million AUS

San Diego 1.4 million CAL

Adelaide 1.2 million AUS

San Jose 1 Million CAL look case studies  Hmm maybe We’re testing lot Australia - encouraging testing, less. lesson: cannot control narrative pandemic. virus care politics, messaging, spin. virus virus things- spread, infect, multiply. rinse n repeat. well-known fact people must want rule people are, ipso facto, least suited it. 

\-Douglas Adams amazed deeply grateful successful terrorist attacks this. know they've caught people could act, assume many heard about, must tempting bad actors cause mass casualty event time vulnerability. Everyone weigh risks.

But profound distrust federal government pharma.

And know many years testing undergo deemed safe.

And we're that.

Edit -
Fixed typo right doubt reddit agree you. thing is, bias twists perception past was. WHO, major countries including mine (India) endorsed mask usage. might many reasons this, primarily shortage mask ppe kits well notion common home made masks enough stop virus particles. proven wrong time mean lied malacious intent. I'm sure one wanted pandemic go control...it's simply moment felt, wrongly, promoting masks best. Ventilators kill respective government likely resources take lot load friends, direct ire towards instead people still job. somebody give tiny brain translation also factor young people feel bulletproof... initial narrative were. Back people still paying attention. think actually hydrogen hydroxide acid. media focused positive percent would encourage states much testing possible Publicly shame her. Shark? shark?

THE BEACHES STAY OPEN. think hospital orders 100,000 masks? like 50 n95s whole unit lmao think really emphasized one best ways get people things appealing vanity. Make masks stylish, sell mask/purse matching combinations, etc etc. subscribe theory evolution, constituents either. fact sinks in, nothing do, however moronic, unsurprising. Either antibody tests general H1N1 family showing past 2009 infections, probably widespread now. American insurance system everything correctly still get fucked, hard laugh absurdity all... hard take bad joke seriously. hero  scummy. Colleges much power. inflated text books inflated tuition grad students actual teachers. students legitimate concerns health wise.  “Indirectly” love name site, ""Contagion Live!"". Somebody get god damned wheel chair. that's going stop virus... 

i see point, official positive cases plateau due testing bottlenecks countries pushed past full testing capacity. Brazil routinely reports 30,000 positive cases day. home state 6,000,000 population 100,000 tests week (MN: 6/5 - 6/11). Im sure US could 500,000 tests day full capacity (though positive). US 30,000,000 tests last 3 months, 100,000 tests day routinely. would close. 

regardless, call flaw model. I'd count every infected person could, hard numbers that, trying extend counts two three months much harder do. Using positive cases gives us good ballpark soon danger coming, goal. wife essential worker, frustrates seeing people walk around masks. comes home every night, idea going get sick going get sick. love wish people would little empathy others stop caring themselves. Florida plate doesn’t mean got yesterday. parents FL residents Cape months. Per friend who's Grady Atlanta went work NYC early on, also quality ventilators - said ones NYC ancient, barely working, like scavenger hunt getting enough functional parts cobble one together sometimes. Georgia make whatever emergency supplies could find, using newer functional devices. (And also much sufficient protection staff, hooray.) Better tools improve outcomes. Well stated! things get wargamed time public preparedness.

That inspire confidence judging current performance. absolutely blame them, brought upon whole anti-mask thing incredible weird, white, blue collar rebellion. 

Compare mask usage Whole Foods Walmart. Formerly Require suggest? Didn’t Cuomo say won’t enforced? so, that’s “requirement”. 10,240 guys actually want help or.... 10k I'm thinking takes time published research catch up. Feel free correct I'm wrong seems like taken long time thorough/comprehensive research mask effectiveness come out, thus still hide behind argument impacts wearing questionable. I'm guessing coming months we'll start seeing research permanent damage.

[This article](http://wherearemypillows.com/?p=1236) collects preliminary understanding COVID-19s longer-term effects. Scroll towards mid bottom links. family thank newsom total failure. People live Bend. breathing like sucker  “And again, 2.5 million people, 2.5 million within couple days going close zero, that's pretty good job we've done.""

“It’s going disappear. One day, it’s like miracle, disappear.” 28 days later....... recession always going come result this, thing recession compared to, say, GFC 2008 would able choose recession would come. chose poor af things payroll protection. problem US? Europe basically reopened countries think mode like that, coordinate cure instead disease. There's lot really fun modes hidden game's menus Lol america response new infections, Louisiana Washington state temporarily halted reopening economies. Washington also mandated wearing masks ordered bars beaches close. Idaho immediately available new COVID-19 cases risen every week four straight weeks. part increase attributed 9% expansion testing, health experts also worried states relaxing stay-at-home orders credited curbing outbreak. Scandinavian countries don’t that, hate tell you. You’re entitled countries benefits grandparent there. parents now.

Besides, you’d want live social systems opposed culture lifestyle. also wouldn’t speak language, you’d never get job anyway, meaning need govt assistance. Scandinavians don’t really want begin you’d burden system. second opinion. know hurt small business owners, constant reopen/close. Buying food spoil... Plague rats. Every last one them. Setting indoor temperature 25 ºC could decrease need social distancing containing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Cooling indoor temperature low may reason COVID-19 outbreak high countries.

20* C = 68* F

25* C = 77* F 

Abstract seems say there's sweet spot 68 77 degrees keep air conditioner at.



edit - Hah karma limit! bested you! America nutshell... Indeed. but, CA MA/NY similar amount distancing measures, yet MA/NY declining, CA spiking FAST...

If base herd immunity indeed 60-70%, 15% infection rate would reduce R0 ~20%, difference CA NY seems much greater that.. sky isn’t crazy powerful filtration machine

Yes important remember that, even outdoors still keep 6ft someone walks cigarette twenty feet away, you’re still likely smell 

Having grown second hand smoke whole life tell massive difference exposed patio versus indoors. part house smell parents smoking, even finished lingered hours. gets clothes hanging closet. major reason refused smoke. also good analogy airborne virus indoors dangerous. smoke cigarette inside outside watch difference smoke also six feet guideline literal magic force field virus particles cease exist.

Yes could still inhale single coronavirus 20ft away. One key factor whether become infected viral load. one reasons public usually weaker symptoms frontline workers. noticed early Wuhan outbreak doctors nurses started wearing masks, younger healthcare professionals dying becoming extremely ill. think what's important consider numerous unknown long term effects, similar Herpes viruses trigger symptoms years gotten handle on. Surviving, stuck lung damage could take years life. stroke, living could lead much problems road. I'd rather fuck possibilities know more. Gov. Noem recognizing fact cannot kiss someone's ass standing six feet away wearing mask. United States saw 46% increase new cases COVID-19 week ended June 28 compared previous seven days, 21 states reporting positivity test rates level World Health Organization flagged 7% diagnostic tests came back positive last week, 5% prior week, according Reuters analysis data COVID Tracking Project, volunteer-run effort track outbreak. Masks today condoms 80s 90s. plenty people refused wear them. Definitely culture customers feel entitled. Stock market doesn’t care apparently either. would appear case, help anyway. fascinating. actually see third offense revocation liquor license  Y'all aint even trying hide bias anymore We've one, yes. second virus? long side wins politicize it. beach safe all? enough time gone really assess protests spread virus. likely did. get wrong, fully support BLM movement, seems little ridiculous assume impact. We're seeing results Memorial Day states opened early. Nice thanks dude. gotta find one Trump's little cats asshole mouth I'll ready work again.

Edit: I'd ask Fauci pair panties. got kink shame. Nursing homes unfortunately huge concern risk serious infection. It’s sad needs done everywhere. NY isn’t even one states nursing home cases. still needs done, states “94% immune responses”

:O

“No serious side effects”

:OOO

“Full protection SARA-CoV-2 replication lungs”

:OOOOOOOOOO




“In mice” 

:| I'm anti-vax. highly vaccinated. work hospital. push vaccination new moms. really high vaccination rate continue push higher. 

I get flu shot recommended. 

And know feel comfortable getting vaccine. Well graphic far terms money resources fight pandemic. ""Mask save economy"" gonna result lot people getting virus, could call 3 months ago call sure. IMF link weird. Here's unreasonable amount diverse countries lumped together! here's five lists feature 10 states! I'd thought IMF bit thorough presenting data. Yep! first day start mask compliance saw 1 sales person 2 customers without masks 5 minute window. noped hell outta space went home. conservatism indirectly linked flouting coronavirus safety measures via reduced intelligence Dunning-Kruger effect. Thank you! opinion response true response ""how get this?"" Also hurr-durr guberment bad. feeling happy 'til got ""mice"" part. people misuse idiots assholes justifying behavior every day last 3 months, unprompted. includes saying ridiculous shit like SURGE 18 cases (15 yesterday). It’s annoying af list updated every 2 weeks. coworkers Trumpies. I'm not. get sick go fellate leader I'mma pissed You’re also 8-12x likely die ventilator without one. wear masks go out

""We CaN't PuT LiVeS hOlD fOrEvEr!!""  Well, advantage selling Windows, coming back bite him, guess. Keep mind countries faculty restrictive, **not** faculty less restrictive. words, countries disregard indications still impose quarantine (Italy probably so).

Also, actually 15 countries China included *but* lifts travel ban towards Europe. Countries also disregard keep China quarantine list regardless. countries play safe make restrictive considerations 100% predictable unbelievably irresponsible. FYI - we're Portland trip planned starting tomorrow. respect (and concern) Bend residents (and ourselves), cancelled. #Onelesstourist. 'Motel parking lot balcony crunk' favorite rapper  think trying get job CNN least I'm at: Positive suspected COVID patients segrated patients ER. There's even controlled entrances exits. 

This widly known fact many ER's many patients assumption going hospital/ER = automatic COVID infections. understand. Unfortunately, COVID know difference. That's fucking horrific. 
That must awful torturous way die, boil alive hot building. Awwwww.  Poor you. going 1+ years rolling lockdowns, business closings, unemployment vaccine comes around without 8 week hard lockdown. say 8+. said 8. That's 4 complete life cycles infection. limited mobility, that's enough clear virtually virus planet (with exception high R0 viruses measles). 

But, go ahead. go thinking know best. lead businesses going business completely systematically shut positive cases consumer confidence completely falls cliff. Better hope increase amount time collect unemployment going need it. believe tip someone goes job description help you, regardless pay is.

The person's argument tipping believe $15/hr livable wage.

$15/hr livable wage.

I believe waiters get paid livable wage tipped. Makes sense. people rush restaurants gonna “my freedom important health” assholes saw protesting months ago.  just? sure, shall wake gets better? either situation. ways businesses safely operate, countries somehow pulling off. says man called ""idiot"", ""clown"", started commenting fact came another country, staff supermarket intervene.

Don't worry, Sweden tolerate /s No; that’d “Kraken”.. remember STILL people wear seatbelts Wouldve nice they'd figured 3 months ago instead. Feel free report her. laugh start receiving fines. Contract tracing researchers ordered ask positive cases presence protests New York. Probably bad idea start opening cases going down.  double, 44%... Double 100% lmao. came high mighty strong message (albeit, confused one), overall come like ass.

If always tipped well, keep tipping well, maybe tack on. usually tip like piece shit, start tipping well, like normal people North America. That's point discussion. Logic would indicate OP trying tell everyone universally double tips, consider tossing more.

Relaxxxxxxx That's natural man, put years. uncomfortable vulnerable front someone met is....strange. therapy led getting right meds figuring shit out. Obviously situations different, consider it, maybe give try message need someone talk it. We're going push hard everyone get flu shots. Good article.  know living Washington state even looking numbers state misleading. spreading lot areas little places. need targeted restrictions. 4% 50%. already has, called American Healthcare system people restaurants, beach, getting together friends family. following mask requirement social distancing. sure news watch sensationalized all.... Anyone can't manage wear mask 1/5th mental capacity required even understand means them. Dont feel bad. forgot 3 digits type closer me! Experts say. I’m empathetic that. It’s outrage original $2.5 trillion literally handed billions upon billions mega corporations exactly jack shit small business owners. seems issue federal government though, they’re ones signed bailout place begin with. 

Having said that, doesn’t give right operate super spreaders time global pandemic. much. that's born. read Berners-Lee post Usenet, job download it, compile NeXT workstation, start diving could us. FTP, Gopher, Telnet, never text \*and\* graphics screen time. Like ""page,"" ""document."" felt similar LaTex easier syntax. 1993 launched first website. Greatest thing is, report listen. hear gotta think everyone losing entire life savings, business, entire income... it’s easy people close lose without kind push back. no, us job qualify unemployment. Everyone wana stay safe still stay home rest lives I’m sure covid ain’t going away ever, everything open wana risk go risk it. realistic keep everyone forcibly inside much longer? Wasn’t said summer shit would gone? started said 2 weeks it’s gona whole year? bet ass ain’t going away whatever reason whoever behind cause next year...

It’s fair business keep operating can’t. Let everyone decide wana risk catching infection 98% survival rate not. go risk skin cancer every day (used to) go risk stomach flu every day, go risk regular flu cold every day let people risk whenever wana stay home rest lives kindly mind business so. I'm angry people arent social distancing and/or wearing masks. 
Im angry govt.
I pray us. God bless. That's problem.


If people would right thing own, one would going gym.

People want rebels sheep, listen.

Businesses can't police people acting foolishly.

Government dosent want make dozens new laws impose individuals.

So easier use local health codes force certain businesses shut while.


If people would right thing while, would much smoother. Businesses would much better situation.

But let's keep extending lockdowns, making things worse everyone, people want sheep. Fearless Girl one: it’s Oxford vaccine gets approved, production already underway distribution rather fast. countries already producing risk. long wash hands handling containers, see would issue. could even heat food short get home worried. definitely kill virus even got die due heat already. genuinely get it, outsider understand what's big deal wearing Damn mask! What's difficult comprehend minor inconvenience?! ""braver"" listening stupid people, dumber. Yes... name ""ButIDontReallyKnow"".

So asked really knew! Corrected posted this, nice try though.

And trust I’m buddy, child. safeguard never depend others right thing. Karma eventually solve issues. Asymptomatic means notice virus inside damage. could A. actually symptoms B. body trying fight virus symptoms that. Either way many reports show long lasting damage lungs, body attacks endothelial cells. Surge capacity projected full within next 2 weeks. prediction disappeared TMC website.   Good math. think 5 800 fair assumption. I'm struggling whether progress directly multiplication. guess certain presumptions virus revisited awhile. people asymptomatic, told low number. people contagious 14 days, show symptoms day 3-6. 5 people, less 1 asymptomatic. family member one 800, likely show symptoms cancel trip. would catch right weekend, expose family become symptomatic. 

I think there's \~4 800 chance grocery store cashier hiding COVID me. im less sure family member would. 

i guess would depend living. I'm programmer working home, chance COVID 5 800, almost zero. (until family party, is) smacks us fuckin face.

And ignore more! Masks impenetrable virus shield think are.

Strange, remember saying thing.... ""those rookie numbers. Hold beer""

-Florida scared many double willful ignorance hate instead allowing learn better go gut feelings. 

and make worse groups weaponizing cost long term health survivors actual lives. Makes hope judgement afterlife held accoutable. Hopefully bar workforce get sort financial support weather shutdown, least help get temp jobs really need financially. shows shutdown extremely tough run second shutdown far less financial support drive large protests, shitting bars basically disaster protests keep virus spreading. Infectious disease expert: could best case scenario 2 years pandemic end

Random redditor: wrong. Whatever say. You’re going around downvoting anyone disagrees it’s obvious agenda push here. I'm betting summer fall 2021 got vaccine things go back normal picking pieces. Scheduling vacations never had, going back bars, etc.

The economy might still gutter though. still listening..I friends planning overnight birthday party resort here..There lot complaining shut downs again, people part problem! People saw packing clubs bars such. Everyone HIGHLY underestimates value reducing hospital stays. lot deaths going come systems reach capacity triage cases. free beds = lives saved. think partially correct. attempt prevent people getting vote. Voting mail disallowed prior actual plan. 

Spoiler alert: Vote mail disallowed, shouldn't. Tell people support Orange. love people die. It’s children can’t handle truth. Look apeshit went month lockdown. imagine would happen told us prepare two-year battle. would anarchy streets. immediately panic

No one that.

Don't put bananas head either! glad got message out. Pizza still probably best bet, though. brief moment leaving oven going box, pizza piping hot temperature, food common method transmission, even room temps, is. Maybe people naturally careful touching/handling food than, say, opening door. True. findings pointed body reacted way made feel asymptomatic felt mild symptoms yet virus still damaged organs: lungs, heart etc. Many people also members ""Party Personal Responsibility"". *cases* suddenly everyone talking about?

It used deaths marker ""how bad country doing"".

Considering ..

a) Many even people Covid dont serious effects
b) even sure deal asymptomatic spread
c) people keep saying ""There many many people infected thought.""
d) isnt ""herd immunity"" something countries working towards? isnt accepted point everybody people Covid?

.. I'm even sure important many cases there, fewer fewer fewer people dying it? Considering people Covid serious, even get anal cases? ZERO people dying would still looking cases? bad cough, fever 101.9, tested positive, lasted 5 days April. Laying couch drinking kombucha. Sure, testing isnt great, maybe protestors getting lazier distancing masks, dont know shit virus. people contracted virus 4 weeks ago spreading people.

It doesnt take lot critical though dude. easier accept media talking points trust feelings guess. need stay stealth while. Let cases skyrocket deaths drop, say, like US. Get people saying ""see, dangerous"" lower guard

Damn, can't sleep. course attending large gathering, even sun *mostly* wearing masks, would increase chance catching disease big crowd. can't believe people still try argue fudging conditions. mention know people go home right protest. simply people got excited.

But article garbage. got one person tested positive. Zero evidence whether got protest.  Christ dense. trust scientific community broadly speaking. I'm saying damn fault significant part country doesn't, we'd much better position right scientific government leaders felt compelled tell truth often. Yeah see 1 example generalize 1.4 billion. Nice job. sure risk exposed distance + get tested. COVID hits rural Ohio rural area, effects end well lack healthcare problem COVID areas. let karma thing imagine laughter meeting get US?

""Last het list ist United States.""

Roaring laughter fills room committee head puts another NEI US file. mean fair, considering pathetic actual pandemic response been, we're probably one countries actually need massive quantities 🙃 Like stepmother stuck dryer really matter cases? Shouldn’t looking number deaths hospitalization? stay low cares people contract coronavirus. Yes seen Trump 2020 masks Etsy early on. mean, hate it, Canadian, agree lost marketing opportunity would reduce spread. I’m sorry happening. certainly aren’t alone flabbergasted anger. Every day I’m feeling like I’m truly living horror movie. core country apparently rotten, wish could either magically fix get normal people hell here. like breweries tours available talk process, history brewery, etc.  One time (pre-covid) brewery Savannah finished batch sanitize yet started, let us climb equipment look insides beer magic happens. like adult playground minutes. fun. 

If bar lots beer taps, point. Vast majority cases mild. number rising infections good might take month deaths people infected days ago register, regard silver lining. 

I see absolute number deaths going back hundred 1,000 day month, mortality rate likely remain decline little. Sounds like southern cities Probably relying luck Press X doubt silly headline. Realistically, there's good chance vaccine approved winter 1 2 vaccines possibly Autumn. little, late. realize he's good person though, right? spent billions dollars two decades orchestrating highly successful PR campaign general public hate way Jeff Bezos. real difference Bezos tax-haven charity. They're billionaires prevent people accessing basic rights way lobbying profits. 

I care much idiots think Bill Gates part 5g/vaccine conspiracy theory, long wakes fact idolizing real world dragons.  It’s also supported data.  ""So told people slow testing down, please""

How's working us?  Oh wow. story sounds like nightmare. 

I many friends work FAANG everytime meet always thought would've better studied CS undergrad instead. seems success terms wealth prestige makes envious time time. 

I guess grass always greener reality oftentimes harsh... key stoping pandemic lawlessness rioting!!!!!!!! tedros notice amount technological advancements we've gone through. We've found potential drugs reduce mortality rate. drug reduce average recovery time. understand cases rises. look brighter side we're actually winning!  drug cocktail successfully treats viable option. hasn’t even three months since shutdown March we’ve already improved way treat disease. Avert gaze, raise arm toward confronter, extend middle finger, continue way. Online would ideal option. suggested wait year take test ideal, better take all. 

Alternatively could try offering bar frequently throughout year fewer people testing center maintain sort social distancing. also another 73 positive cases first test. Considering time two tests 14 days think safe say person tested positive twice.

That's sample size 103, honestly great either. Yo bro don’t feed troll. Nope, sincerely believe contracted bought killed quickly fever disappeared. day smell stinkiest shit weed, dog food, food(unappetizing can’t distinguish smells. It’s kind headache concentrate &amp; overall intelligence taken slight tax imo enormous subtle It’s almost surreal alive spot days ago. Luxuries like....basic human contact families.

Yes. Luxuries like that. 

However, nobody saying can't ""basic human contact."" That's straw man. Brazil's death toll seems large, remember around number murders every year.. worse dying natural virus. drug violence pandemic worst Latin America failure controling 4. China using soldiers test subjects It'd never enforced it'd nightmare restaurants actually tried it

Even now, there's little enforcement capacity limits. basically honor system, know that's working actual headline? Alaska Hawaii beginning pandemic. 

They fined people braking quarantine. Lmaooo end near!!!!! Unless fine everyone getting it, yes. wonder. already exist courts require DUI offenders use regularly. Google ""DUI interlock system."" I'm spreading fear.

I'm discussing realities. may find realities difficult hear understand sympathize that.

I'm enemy explaining risks delivering premature vaccine.

I think made work conditions think political leaders threat life.

Not wanting use poorly tested vaccine poorly understood virus risk carries household less valid concern virus.

And instead treating like enemies, need treat political leaders like they're trying kill us. are.

You're trying kill me. I'm trying kill you. trying best families knowledge have. time? Multiple times shift? that's headed.

My dad worked ER decades. maybe decide stuff like twice. Normal triage whole world hallways filling dying people can't get time. mean ton variables play hard say really one way other. common sense would say gathering thousands chanting ideal.

I also wonder, 30% NYC antibodies April, help limit spread since ton immune?

The thing think comes play age, lots younger protestors. average age dropped significantly last 2 weeks, bet TON young people even bother getting tested going one events people read article, please feel free leave evidence outrage 🤣 dumb explanation. bet people refuse wear masks idea national debt is. national debt 5 trillion twenty years ago, deaths number tragedies since still impact people. mention Japan 3 trillion debt people still wear masks, Italy France 2 million debt people desensitized covid.  
 
Being upset pay taxes stupid thing tie pandemic. idiots. care. average American entitlement attitude worth it. 

Don't blame them. afraid therapy reason. Wouldn’t get us close herd immunity? I’ve read articles close 50% considered herd immunity? lot fireworks displays changed social distancing events, people encouraged park view them, view home.

Some, dryer regions, cancelled fire danger increased exposure firefighters case wildfire result. test like? daughter got talking work (grocery store) telling people wear masks. complained one this. said that's problem. I'm proud giving this. fact lot really smart people saw (in numerous contries) passed chain. decision makers seeing reality, balked horrible truth tried half ass way it. Think ""code red"" e-mail chain Jan/Feb amongst U.S. scientific community. Senator Burr (R-NC) telling donors privately ""think Spanish Flu"" regards impending outbreak. treat us like children can't handle truth, fact responsible lives ones closest us. realized March faimily utterly own. (way many typos, sorry) Yup. do. literally thousands scientists/researchers Keep going, almost there! hear woman said, straight face: ""I wear mask reason wear underwear: things gotta breathe.""

Keep classy, Florida. poor guy can't catch break. Actual cases 10 times higher according CDC, would put fatality rate around 0.5

The dutch CDC also said 98 % people barely experience symptoms, 0.5 needs ICU care. dont ICU survival rate would guess puts fatality rate 0.3. articles use words like “presumed” “appears” also stating still don’t know much virus. Much concern food handling. feel like you’ve never BOH think everything 100% clean safe. lol wondering returning home would give zero chance survival.... think it’s complete lack self-discipline. NJ resident: Imagine actually \*deported\* NJ.

hulk\_i\_see\_this\_as\_an\_absolute\_win.jpg spent amount time last summer. took paternity leave I’m teacher leave went summer well. great summer could go things. worried born really isn’t bad all. sucks stuck home. realize virus starts sickening friends, relatives &amp; co-workers it'll induce sheer panic. public end self-isolating own. happened Sweden lockdown shutdown. Citizens felt dangerous sheltered home without government mandate. never reached needed 60 70% threshold herd immunity. Whether like not, whether governors restrict not, public life indeed ""stay home dystopia"" infection rate subsides point ppl feel safe venture freely.  absolutely correct. fact Lincoln knew order suspended habeas corpus around rail lines. done insure Congress could convene pass wartime protections US. 

Lincoln brilliant, really could use Lincoln right now. locked prison? understand indeed... There's truth this, think sharing indoor spaces, prolonged proximity large groups superspreaders, fomite density food consumption face-touching, probably make th situation worse. least like Halloween, Thanksgiving. Yet. one stopping people basic human contact families.

Yeah, Florida screwed, unfortunately we're going screw anyone come contact, too. Sorry. They're quarantining beach, they'll try stay six feet away residents do! Honestly none surprises me. image Sweden projects outwards always different reality culture. unfortunate many people suffer die it.

China again? **Outdoor transmission really, really rare.** know Reddit full lazy NEETs fine shut-ins, personally not.   Setting aside actual context subject matter words used...

Do realize complete intellectual disparity two comments, original reply reply me? reply meant say originally, say that? use intellectual prowess 12 year old make comment doesn’t address issue hand; follow another comment actually reads like adult. 

What’s purpose inciting, insightful, comment begin with? It’s light form trolling reduces volume audience message. better that. looked wow you’re right. It’s especially frightening knowing Bergamo, Italy site highest known antibody prevalence population match also held February 19th article also discusses public transportation use getting game people gathering watch game bars friends houses.  agree. title also misleading places almost entire focus Fauci saying may never decent vaccine, read article like ""We cannot act respond good vaccine guaranteed"", agree with. whenever say things like get ""Well, yeah, alarmist doom-and-gloom sells"", funny depending side they're people either get upset say ""yeah that's way is"" headlines.

Edit: Woohoo, downvotes. familiar feeling, least know sub I'm back now. Ha probably cross reactive immunity Coronaviruses actual genetics. awful, numbers going astronomical. 

Hear I'm trying push agenda. I'm extremely cautious regard Covid, family works medicine, believe could save lot lives everyone wears mask.

I've noticed worldometers daily death rate stayed since mid May. Looking places like Brazil also bad outbreaks seems like something happened May death numbers flattened out. see every graph rising cases.

Originally thought well, deaths lag quite bit. California steady incline cases since May, recent 2 week spike like TX, AZ, FL. due access new meds, Brazil using meds? would effective flatten death rate. 

Virus getting weaker?

Virus burned vulnerable communities first, like kindling, slow burn whole population?

People say intubating less. still intubating people, intubating early. really much choice, doctors intubate someone unless think person die without it, think ""decision"" tube less often somewhat overemphasized.

I would say possible older people staying inside young people getting sick, bringing CFR, would case Brazil? 

Look know Brazil best testing surely easier fake testing hide dead. cases climbing death rate since May. Also sure Brazil really many nursing homes, assume people care elders home. Also certain mask compliance Brazil, could bring viral load down, resulting infections less think either virus getting weaker vulnerable populations got hit really bad beginning. can't think better reason decline deaths. certain IFR 0.6 would see corresponding delayed death increases numbers started change. Either something doing, something doing. virus frustrating, wish could understand happening.


Edit: outbreak Iran death curve mirrors case stupid people elect stupid people. real life truman show Sorry, there’s way square circle. Either assembling public spreads virus doesn’t. can’t call beach closures justifying massive protests. taking Rebekah Jones said last week grain salt continues may something. pretty much said start going start artificially lowering numbers move phase 3 quicker. Mondays Tuesdays always seem lower I'm sure happening right now. What’s best place keep track percent positive tests Florida?  thing buddy. Need anything more? quick easy google took seconds need anymore help I'm glad so. Yeah, hear that. Yesterday rejected ""moss"" pun-up contest simple plant fungi, wrong pun contest based spores originally rather fungi specifically. Boy face red War? he’s trying protect people unlike rest country. everybody option. People still need go work supermarkets hospitals. viral load population directly increases risk. Yes, first group infected assholes, spread others assholes. know single one people attending event go home quarantine 14 days keep community safe. Agree! also use hospital capacity, drugs short supply like Remdesivir, force PPE use hospitals, tests, etc.  they'll delay eventual partial reopenings infections stay high. 


When someone gets sick, hurts us all. Yeah, mask enforcement 100% individual businesses well. Gaming Control one making sure we’re jumping promised hoops, license line don’t comply. imagine mask mandate enforced similarly casinos. heard rumblings business licenses could line non-compliant non-gaming establishments. 

As quarantine, countries getting contact information. wonder Hawaii enforcing 14-day quarantine whole time. bit easier go airport, imagine must special department checking people somehow. Either that, posters mentioned, maybe threat enough keep people going. would traveling moment anyway, definitely wouldn’t spend money go somewhere chance get singled spend entire time I’m hotel. robocalls specifically. ill make non standard noise, human understand, machine wont. line auto disconnect. apologizing turning competition. Tone come across well internet. agree young children need structure classroom learning fundamentals. think underestimating psychological toll causing teens. Even online college students still social life. really comparable online college. Texas: Death Wahhh Little baby cry little baby tears 😭😭😭 think need break computer little baby go get fresh air feel better good friend. Nope. many people strictly wore masks strictly socially distanced since February gotten virus. know several people got virus, 2 died. public without PPE. Unfortunately fortunately, would unethical, doctors ethical people might surprise find almost media owned corporations. still think wrong. Continue strongest military innovative companies. still changed. that's .04% teacher Wait till start fining license plate counterpost

Counterposting like counter sniping basement dwelling nerds She* Resurgence? NEVER WENT AWAY. Personally wear mask I’m going closer 6’ someone, doesn’t really happen I’m outside. Got it... gyms safe Florida. I’m TX well feel like people mindset “I’m risk, won’t *die!*” seeming forget shitty medical system even go hospital eventually okay they’ll still get huge medical bill! That’s perfectly selfish reason people stay inside. think need stop playing altruistic reason keeping neighbors safe instead play possibly high doctor medical bills you’ll get even it’s somewhat mild case. joke. I’ve professors three feet still feel spit face they’re lecturing. 

As recent graduate university know schools desperate get students back campus financial reasons campuses aren’t save safe students Covid-19 spread like forest fire colleges. It’s impossible social distance especially big university. None exclusive Sweden. countries locked hardest, problems also occured.

So prove lockdowns work prove lockdowns work?

Or prove?

Or importantly - *YOU* trying prove? right? - daily One Man Swede Bashing Crusade win internet points glory 'right'?

This pandemic over. is, maybe proven right. maybe proven wrong.

Either way, no-one really give toss. one person caught Coronavirus study, part group DIDN’T EVEN GO GYM, tells us gyms safe one coronavirus.  thought prevent orange spray coming off. Happy cake day!

You got link new federal guidelines? Masks hinder heavy breathing. Live free...and die? economy Imperial Great Britain heavily - mean heavily, point literally starving without - dependent colonial periphery. vast majority US trade is...with US, US self-sufficient food, timber, wide range raw materials. 

I know people love ""ah, one thing like thing"" far differences US end Imperial GB similarities. Vail said pressure businesses implement rules demand customers follow them.

Sure, customers also need common sense goldfish. mean there's going real estate boom Milton empty houses? think get cheap condo something? well simular concern, said start protests protests *and 120% suppor them* might take heat issues, protests part it, opening bars, factors people soon fast. environment take mask chew, surrounded people eating, smacking, talking, slurping.

Salt pepper shakers touched others. Well, main development region Atlantic hurricanes currently record high sea surface temperature. sayin'. Yeah, girlfriend's Canada, wouldnt know her, totally real. Right. subheading ""A first-of-its-kind study proved could safe gyms reopen""... yikes. ""could be"" pulling lot weight there. ""could"" safe people covid-19 going gym spread it, ""low prevalence"" covid-19 community. Thanks rude like others. remember too, get honestly. noone win election popular vote even let people vote president? essentially mean votes worthless? Like sure count votes, ultimately changes nothing. feels symbolic anything else; like Russia ""elections"" know Putin always get elected whether people vote not. different reality. guy interviewed Tulsa trump rally said knew someone died another hospital breath know believe read article I'm bit confused. article seems one person went protest started experiencing symptoms COVID-19 next day, seems indicate contract disease protest. people referenced contracting COVID subject's friends also attended protest. However, say person interacted friends way outside protest. ride car together? meet person's house protest? Since subject's friends, potentially many interactions side protest.

Despite article title, contents article actually indicate virus contracted protest. fact, named person article obviously contract protest. possible spread friends others protest, enough information article draw conclusions.

For record, I'm saying virus spread protests, I'm saying article make strong argument was. live, &lt;30% actually wear masks. family members, social distancing, asking visit us. brother asthma top that, also immunocompromised. that’s NO, chief. Two cousins showing initial signs COVID, we’ll see start taking seriously. they’re dumb rednecks dunno. 

And churches started holding, in-church service, we’re skyrocket. worst possible person charge right now.... America's collective ADD really going bite us ass since people can't seem see initial wave shutdowns prevent exactly what's happening now....which, spoiler alert, way worse economy we'd stayed shut may Partly younger cohort, partly takes long time die. can't speak gyms. gym go taken safety measures lower risk contracting virus. Sanitizing bottles given us upon entry cleaning crew responsible wiping cardio workout machines. Every cardio machine use maintain distance. ventilation system also great facility This....this bonkers. hate say need people power personal brushes illness, see serious effects be. strange things stay others get removed?

Edit: Look below. bot going around taking votes worst bots. Comment ""bad bot"" every single goddamn one auto mod deletions. were, still worth help hard times?...

Just food thought... kind, friend. need hand time time. Bartender LA here, every customer I've people taking seriously Thanks questions! Sorry time respond to. log now. Hope interesting. Yes, remedesvir sucks. take HCQ +, Tocilizumab, Anakinra virus union allow coronavirus work Independence Day? federal law, like weed, enforced one enforce it. lives Kentucky 0%  beaches causing spread. . like big nightclub. . cant people wear masks socially distance? honestly may one quest home tests mail you. AC broken car right really want sit hours heat. Yea, used kind like Musk Rogan. unsubscribed podcast that. Rogan says one listen anything like science politics he's dummy. He's right stopped listening him. Musk dumb piece shit got rich Daddy's money - according actual engineers experts - know he's talking much anything. ('Hyperloop' fucking fraud example). He's investor hires real talented engineers Spacex/Tesla. (But humans going Mars anytime soon. know, actually listen real scientists engineers instead pretending one wealth). **WILL** shift blame. people aren’t wearing masks seem think everything overblown, really affects high risk people stay home avoid contact. think regular people fine—and they’re overwhelmingly right. don’t seem consider sick work weeks still shitty even aren’t hospitalized, still don’t want friends, coworkers, risk yourself. feel like knowing brings problem closer home.

That's exactly right would worked sacrifice quarter year self-isolation. People straight tired hearing much need sacrifice hysteria others. Masks big issue, right now, months later, rent due jobs pretty much gone, people done dancing tune keeps shifting.

If 3 months ago, name game ""Live pretty much like normal wear mask"" there'd far less pushback. Corona hysteria burned good common person left. strategy change forcing 99% people act certain way making 1% people risk take burden responsibility. I’m concerned well well people around you

Though say worst yet come, hospitals *are* getting full number hotspots, guess I'm confident enough say there's chance. Huh. Fair point.

Man I'm game today. Also guns yeah think guns would improve things much. nice see self aware American tho. know got way salute you! Yep thats real kicker...but seems folks FL concerned number positive percentage positive...so easy ""fix"" Governor....kinda like reclassifying definition ""available"" ICU beds cdcs numbers. think making good point article mention fact working photographer got infected.

But diligent mask usage, get shocked infection.

Honestly, I'm shocked pregnant woman professional photoshoot April/May. NYC opened indoor activities yet (like restaurants). That's July 6th. We're going fuck too. Silly. pigs white. bomb people color country. Like Tulsa Philadelphia. new study Norway

Ahh. Almost there... What, managed infect first place? locked 100 days mental health decreasing, let attempt help.

You stay locked inside house. exercise, socialize, things outdoors. fact, outdoors one safest places be, assuming following distancing protocols staying confining responsible friend group.

A friends coworkers I've tried help similar ways - Take walks. resources knowledge, camping trips - Get house away news cycle worrying time.

You take road trips - Bike trips, I'm sure level physical fitness even walks park simple things like really lighten day.

Being outside one lowest possible vectors transmission, *especially* keeping 6 feet apart, even wearing mask cautious.

I seen friends family often have, outside, keeping safety mind.

You live like hermit forego activities this, still live life. cautious safe. mental health important neglect thinking absolutely stay inside times, don't. Uhhh wearing mask protecting people symptomatic? meant stop airborne particles coughing sneezing. Maybe make argument talking case could also keep distance ya know... talk people. national database people dont want wear masks, blacklisted covid treatment.

We see quickly many people truly believe hoax flu free hospital ICU space. wondering also title isn’t...no offense. That’s kind it’s one rules alter title article post, want make clarification comment  bad virus doesn’t give shit side fence you’re on, lol. include state R0 1 higher, 36 according RT - usually say people 50/50 shot whether they'll survive vent total toss up, yeah, success rate percentage still generally 20%, mostly we're slowly learning covid vascular illness, much respiratory one.  don’t think there’s testing capacity results? Animals carry well.
Just someone gets indicate someone necessarily something wrong.
Masks full proof. None measures are.
Don't delude false sense security. Watch numbers continue spike even people mask up. then? Probably copycat another respiratory virus type less original current player. H1N1 played many times. 

Of course fond bacterial class, mycobacterium tuberculosis yersinia pestis old school pros. Well texhbi protect you... alot. Maybe 20% state reported positivity rate 15% past 10 days.

Edit:  heard funny theory Trump anti mask itll rub face makeup off. guess find soon, since cares image god damn cringey  Pandemic, murder hornets, Sahara dust cloud...what’s next? Super volcano, giant meteor, zombies?? mistaken, let show you. deny reason source omit context? Well let's examine quote. “I press India’s demand 50,000 tons month 12 months concentrated asking 150,000 tons December, January February.

Leathers Winston vehement this.”-Leo Amery Diaries Volume II, page 950 understand covers November 10th , nothing, Indians breed like rabbits""

Ironic call 'angry' yet refuse acknowledge something said makes furious. Watch continue deny something basic. almost certain frustration deny again. need put life hold, small things like limiting close social contact, wearing masks, practicing good hygiene, isolating ill help lower spread virus.

If people work home much possible, that's going cause economy harm. Wearing mask may small annoyance majority people. Keeping distance others stores hard. Yet, things, small impact lives help ensure need take drastic measures.

Where live, working home norm moment, business allowed open, restaurants open reduced seating capacity. Life close lockdown, yet average number daily new infections still 10 per million, daily Covid-19 related deaths 1 per million, number critical cases stable.
It's small things prevent much damage economy. everybody acts like nothing going on, may lead stricter measures businesses suffer more. forget white fragility part. color skin. Tracking people naive, difficult obtain information secretly without consent phone apps gps data constantly synced cell network towers. Keep thinking basic level, already gave everyone inch yard post reddit mobile, go live hermit inclined. many people can't cook. hope Europe keeps indefinitely then. Keep evangelical shit away rest us. timing indicates didn’t get protest, likely contagious protest. spreads much easier indoors AC seems factor well.

Perhaps ""up to"" part fines kick make doable hardest hit amongst us.

Mkay. spikes, blame. wonder much death reported, less hundred death per day tens thousands got infected. something right. Yeah. Pretty much businesses still using masks stores “mask required” signs, aren’t enforcing I’ve seen. couple stores like Lowe’s didn’t enforce begin far could tell. Everyone doesn’t care anymore numbers aren’t high area. Education levels really low mistrust ignorance high too. example, high school graduated from(in Illinois city visit go places) less 50% graduation rate. freshman class almost 700 think 300ish us graduated(on time). I’m going need new excuse workout now... Missed talking point update last week. No, rural Kentucky conservative, mostly they've getting paid vote conservative candidates decades. cities, Louisville even Lexington, liberal progressive. despite holding population majority, votes never seem make much difference way things drawn up. never complicated. looked countries managed virus did: Taiwan 20 million people close ties China controlled virus businesses stayed open. S. Korea Japan minimal impact businesses stayed mostly open. many asian countries. common culture wearing masks public, value science.

We unfortunately anti-maskers believe liberty applies themselves. me, me, culture. lot easier stay home depend everyone wear proper mask. I’m saying masks don’t work, I’m saying we’re conundrum own, extremely strong, anti-mask messaging months. Turning dime single hamster study 1 month ago expecting perfect compliance ridiculous. got us mess. Wait Twitter pushing agenda? (the Stafford Act) §401 states part that: ""All requests declaration President major disaster exists shall made Governor affected rapid spread novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across United States met decentralized piecemeal response led primarily governors, mayors, local health departments. disjointed response accident.

I've people complaining mouse work... holding air like TV remote... early days crazy. general mask wearing social distancing public nothing fear this. grocery store workers masks gloves face shields. convention creating new virus, already exists. anybody wearing mask today risk anybody wearing mask convention. convention make worse us protecting ourselves. makes worse people don't. also trump voters. I'm talking safety measures businesses reopen supposed follow. Underrated comment right here. Cause cdc's flavor month god. Stop gym. one wears masks including employees, pretty full even day one distances seems care pandemic going on. owner care either. SoCal. seems pretty unsafe find pretty likely transmission point hundreds thousands people passing everyday.

Then magazine supported fitness industry. type talk realtors always good time buy house. Putin president United States intents purposes Shockingly professional mostly intelligent person. advanced college degree gotten carry couple times shutdown. shit. reason take pizza, burgers curry. foods cope carried around box suffer. one questioning protests spreading covid19, question rate much fault vs opening bars things. Yes, rendition bit clearer understand ;-)

It seems FL's governor literally playing Trump's public messages spewed out...""...With smaller testing would show fewer cases..."" I'm that, sorry Totally here. remember, /r/coronavirus safe activity locked room yourself, anything outside unreasonable. 

Mental health actually matters, obviously people disagree that. Also depends gets vent - family there, docs willing accept reasonable ventilate 96 year old patient covid handful conditions likely prolong death. Ventilation associated drugs complications likely kill anyway. Might well try less invasive methods (Cpap Bipap seem often better-outcome options anyway). So, fewer people low chance survival get intubated countries. US, docs hospitals want avoid getting sued “everything possible” prolong life. think they're communicating every way possible point effective way reach literally terminally selfish. I’m hoping families able keep kids home easy time distancing kids school. 

A friend idea high schoolers online learning using high school spread elementary kids. Based kids’ experience, think great. cannot teach second grader work. could help older daughter manage time assignments needed. always case Florida due fewer labs work weekend? Weird. Anyway, thanks tip parentheses removable link would still work. took out. much effort extraneous pseudo-joke-science comment. :P virus care cause

This article contains real information. There's one case obviously contracted protest, vague reference cases (the reporter try contact friends got sick?)

This really dubious information make seem pragmatic - makes appear pushing political agenda seizing thin, weak article eye-catching headline supports point want argue comments. learned nothing? Everyday like watching train wreck slow motion repeat. Seriously world need cut ties China leaving isolationist country manufacture goods elsewhere. media please stop trying convince people go logic common sense. helps perpetuate already thousands upon thousands making bad decisions like wearing masks going bars increase reckless/selfish behavior. said don’t care history books told you. underdeveloped nations world, especially widespread fit definition. didn’t say don’t care history. said don’t care version you’re placement spectrum makes zero minute details leave room interpretation. countries may divided 1st (US), 2nd (Russia) 3rd (Africa, etc), cant argue poverty isn’t widespread infrastructure considered developed anymore. Oh wait, argue you’ll spout weird posts like pseudo-intellectual are.

I also don’t recall ever said America third world country. made joke. America impoverished disgusting. Reason #28373733 Americans fucking degens insurance companies looters. think got billions dollars Trump's secret slush fund... uh... mean... Stimulus package? I'll preface with, doctor nearly informed people know. basically happening covid causing oxygen production drop patients almost 70%. Usually doctor apply ventilator pneumonia lungs start produce less. last ditch effort, cases covid, believe body needs slow breathing able recover lungs. case ventillators, forcing breathe, giving lungs enough time process recover forcing work need rest. overworking allowing recover. narrative around ventillators changing learn information. unfortunate many died ventillators might able survive put them, unfortunately medicine works. try-fail process. Anyways, appologize even coherent hope helped! sorry comfortable spreading misinformation tragic death millions spread incite hatred.

When 'sources' capable copy pasting quotes without inserting narrative let know. honestly remember unity, 5 Twin Towers fell.

Like people died pneumonia 300% . normal year without it.  (Oh wait...we even counted extras). information incorrect. 
The pendulum actually way. dare speak truth... carrying knife around times now. like it. That's me. people fucking crazy. yet consistently sick, poorest especially least educated reproduce.

if fence look listen ignorance partisanship Anymore? hasn’t been, isn’t new. Florida thing NY back March. honestly think (re)close bars eat restaurants. two likely places transmission, neither something without. People attending places right now, frankly, least likely taking seriously. one know vigilant would set foot restaurant right now, leaves less vigilant attendance. I’m one people thinks there’s immunity 1 really sloppy study Wuhan, Rand Paul model behaviors wants see constituents even though immunity. fLu really. wearing ""rights"", see point. completely disagree this. definitely way easier put ventilator. Someone else you. Now, may way less comfortable way less convenient, don’t work get face. Yes finally managed read article changed assumption. That's deleted it. There's also possible scenarios agree assumption likeliest, probably got pedestrians walks. date assume person infected wearing mask. Much time, work well, efficient, become problematic means journalists ignoring better qualified sources *letting authorities drive narrative*. 

Can suggest systematic laziness, related journalism all? Already did. Haha :) probably bit both. seen strong leader. Tha's understatement century right there. Like still can't test process tests efficiently. speak language.  like 6 weeks. Look long took places spike lockdown March. Lockdown mid March, peak surge late April. going get wiped out? Masks Prevent spread everybody would stop whining would shape in, government would encourage science would trouble in. healthcare providers want get life back normal . clue go daily basis amount deaths seeing people innocently infected virus. people nothing wrong live lives dying droves. Unusual six seven deaths day work whereas intensive care six seven every two weeks. Healthcare providers angry people making politics truth . people believing scientific fact believing Facebook Memes posts something grandma Sue told heard. That’s attitudes angry didn’t it’s Yep 90% people get wear ventilator fuck Also, wear properly. barber picture wearing upside down, I’ve seen way many times. Yelp pretty much like (a good thing).

I post whenever business requires mask 1 star business (especially employees wearing masks).  Last updated today, basically European countries still list. running behind updating info, EU wrong say EU citizens allowed entry 14 approved countries list... media perhaps reporting last part correctly? many questions:( Someone else said nearest site booked July 16 - Florida remember part. Link says jerk spreading protests. No, fine post it. understand country--maybe others--love promote mixed signals kinds serious matters. true! lot politicians get funded telemarketing Right, public perception right mortality rate 3% (or less) death/severe complications mostly impact sick elderly. Meanwhile, job losses disproportionately impact young healthy.

So goes forward, would young healthy people continue comply? Especially don’t regular contact elderly people?

I’m saying it’s right, I’m saying it’s happening. Quarantine fatigue already growing. smart quarantine people stop listening. Yea they've come some, thinking comparison cases previously peaked April. we're around 7%, previously looks like around 20% beginning April 12-13% end. That's cool wearing mask bearing I'll forced ventilator. people wear masks. many not. everyone cares makes sense lead think really excellent analogy. Consider angry become someone something stupid road near us -- mix frustration, fear, disempowerment felt people behaving responsibly pandemic. while, getting Northern California Tahoe like Logan’s Run. made Nevada border, good. Talked guy said got pulled parking lot grocery store California side ticketed. Granted, seemed county measure. Asthma allergies created nice little combo that’s active since March, get little bit sick brushing teeth. makeshift mask bandana that’s bad tie ponytail, it’s tight around face. shake like little dog go stores super necessary (I pick rx needed start yesterday). 

I don’t believe masks scheme liberals. don’t think it’s human rights violation track people willingly entering business. pandemic response team also disbanded 2018. still infectious disease staff members actively planning pandemic.

And profitability huge driver. team would make expensive recommendations like expanding hospital staff, stockpiling PPE, forth.

But costs money something hospital thought something would prepare later.  NYC 75,000 teachers. Please put things perspective. likely true, though.

But since know factors make someone superspreader, can't predict one, good message push right now. would hate see change HVAC negative flow, filtration, etc. Well do. poor/no leadership. make changes. know world gone shit I'm favor insurance company denying life insurance someone Neither much rest world. EU less monolithic yet every member country notable exception Sweden locked down. don’t stand people would risk it. patio maybe sitting indoors eat crazy me. Order take don’t wanna cook. commondreams.org may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* need speak manager badly possibly order carryout Agree disagree. Mask usage area become near universal indoor buildings, starting way back late March, that’s without history mask usage education attempt state local government. serious education effort leading example top strongly believe country would least level now. know countries count same? checked Danish CDC says total tests. FHM specifically says tested individuals. 
Anecdotal evidence parents’ home care tells care givers tested once. what’s number total tests tested individuals? eh... 'trust verify' Alex Jones. Paranoid fantasies trusted. shit.....

the heat kill it


not Hmm, saw protesters masks 2 friends told saw thing take statement whatever want.

But know neither merit discussion Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Thanks PAYWALL link. even much authoritarian, fines pinpricks rich derail life poor. corporal punishment (like caning) would equitable. Raw numbers maybe - percent positive likely tick considerably. someone told Trump Nancy Pelosi, Obama, Schumer, Bolton, Trudeau, Merkel masks, would pushing masks hard. expect moderators nuke comment political know true. Never wildest dreams would imagine restaurant dining barbershops would hill Americans would die upon. get Morning Consults polling newsletter, despite people still wary things like malls movie theaters, alarming number see problem dining restaurants. Literally, environment take mask chew, surrounded people eating, smacking, talking, slurping.

For God's sake, movie theater high ceiling, least small enclosed space mall. People zero actual thinking skills, decide things want safe they'll alright rest. even get started bars, environment literally lower inhibitions ability process risk intoxication. Really? Chinese non-Chinese Asians attacked many, many countries pandemic think it’s racism? visiting parents. wear mask around precaution. steroid wide use yet? 

All I've seen one single non-peer-reviewed study found helpful. data study even published yet, actually.  Yeah, nurse 4:1 ratio, may called surge ICU, ICU level care. (That normal ratio people normal floors) see nothing wrong experiment. Maybe adding towel soaked acid would another acceptable test. According covidactnow, they've 100% ICU capacity well. unbelievably fucked. understand point making 80+ people get sick Michigan bar reopened? sure list either. Yes! hoards teenagers Columbia Park days insane. mean... insidiously like flu colds?

Please: Stop using hyperbole here.

It spreads like virus. Truth real world: people coronavirus various sorts even know it. think really important first foremost recognize different countries different kinds misinformation problems (in many ones [we survey](http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/survey/2020/overview-key-findings-2020/), people -- arguably rightly view -- identify domestic politicians spreading false misleading information concerning problem). one misinformation problem, many, one context, many, social media part parcel many problems, lot elite behavior think let especially politicians hook set aside. 


So do? largely political question wrote somewhat sceptial direct content regulation controversial, highly political, often ambgious terrain interventions misused powerful people want silence dissent. 


In absence kind direct approach personally see lot potential indirect approaches, called [open societies robust think supported empirical research [Edda Humprecht et suggesting countries free expression, strong, diverse independent news media resilient misinformation others, even though also high levels social media use.

So again, different responses different problems, different problems different countries, cases personal preference would combination protection fundamental rights, investment suporting independent professional journalism (as well fact checkers media + information literacy efforts), greater regulatory oversight platform companies ensure greater accountability, transparency, intellegibility. written issues focused specifically European context. **33.9%** positive Lee County. 222 New cases. win? Still mask requirement. Beaches, businesses, restaurants, gyms, water parks open. Exactly, way display affection touching getting someone's face. true prior covids true now. completely agree. make sense require mask also dine ""So lemme get straight - keep clean room isolation ward give bunch tests do, gotta let jam probe butt every couple days? Sold."" No, sources good. paraphrased Yamcha Goku good friends, arguing that. go way back well. Yamcha’s best friend Puar though bond Krillin Goku special. Goku disturbed Krillin’s murder hands Frieza induced super Saiyan transformation. (And wasn’t even first time Goku seen Krillin die). don’t think loss friends ever induced strong emotional response Goku Yeah, you’re absolutely right. I’ve feeling lot peer pressure coworkers gone back office. don’t single friend doesn’t follow rules. Would love hear drew conclusion pal Agreed. politicians would structured re-opening, people would received sort message them. Instead let everything reopen people took comfort that. saying anything, said lot. luck catch friend. gotta believe.  re-open patios. open-air ventilation occupancy caps indoor seating. 

That's they've done province Canada. outbreaks we've tied funeral gatherings. Hopefully fall gets chilly patios open better treatments vaccine coming pipe. Cops fine local governments sign support this. kansas, reject it, matter many cases virus towns/counties. WhAtAbOuTiSm forget senate voted bill provide essential workers hazard pay, $10,000 each. stopped sailing, none would've happened. Thanks Columbus. absolutely crazy guy apparently better Swedish Danish history Swedes/Danes themselves. guess Swedes blamed Denmark Danish king executed 100 people capital streets? building strawman. Although see think even event would somehow ""Sweden's fault"". really need answer that? It'll fine. We've killed vulnerable people already Team Covid. know wasn't?

the testing numbers pitiful back then. Yes aged well YOU.

That's point. people, something others (like wearing mask) nature. Tis flesh wound someone hated them, probably care nobody wore mask workplace.

Or caught took home mom. Absurd. get issue. Maybe people think sick people wear mask. Honestly, wish could quit. Walk away this. disgusting. opinion naive. hiding cases Sunday, less get processed. consistent even started get US government simply ordering Americans wear masks least shops public transport. wear mask short time hardly bother would already help lot. That's corporations care run country/politicians. stop talking like child, maybe could discussion.

Surprise pikachu face? fucking 12? shop owners aren’t willing risk losing customers facing kind legal bs, even honestly deal people difficult causing scene. state isn’t enforcing kind teeth.

I don’t agree, it’s store :/ yeah ""1/10"" number given seem highly unlikely. would 90% people ventilators dead. dont think so, look I'm sure supposed joke not. article's people getting plague Inner Mongolia. That's entirely different disease entirely different region China. That's wildly inaccurate. estimates I've seen state US government contributed approximately $70 million development remdesivir. sounds like lot, realize [median cost bringing drug market $900 $3000 lot money, look drugs cost, hardly outrageous.  Hotspot come.  Flipping Liberal snowflakes killing hope financial comeback BS pandemic. 99% recovery. Screw Kate Brown. Depends kind ground on. live house stilts Portland 5.5 hit metro area I'd sliding hill I'm on. mention soil liquefaction would wreck metro area.  Nah disagree. nice day. think reference army closing bridges la Dark Knight Rises gonna do? Quit patients pandemic?

Yeah, probably?

No one would expect continue nurses free, really matter ""how low go?"" 

Cutting pay 5%? 10%? 50%? jumping point different everyone, eventually everyone jumps. I’m way justifying opening bars/restaurants states reason outdoor patios can’t suffice due heat summer weather. People want air conditioning. Again, agree shouldn’t opening establishments, give flavor many people prefer indoors southern US. came back Russia England months abroad, Americans pathetically vapid. still cant believe argument US. Holy fucking shit people insane.  You’re misunderstanding rules. It’s non essential businesses shut. There’s restriction movement people request stay home. take U.S. approach. believe exists ignore it, go away! McConnell awful man Trump. fail see incivil point out.  walking grilfriend. Children land fucks sake. hate people think like this. many people behave way. live NY 72yo diabetic landlord goes stores diner everday (diner takeout only), proclaims he's terrified virus always wears mask places. 

Right told (literally minute 2), friend NC called &amp; landlord invited go dinner soon NY opens sit-down restaurant dining. guy also walks around maskless outside building sits stoop talks neighbors (some also maskless).

People want believe they're taking seriously protecting reality taking half-measures. similar people many 1-night stands almost always wear condom, occassionally skip lol really thought serious? Attacking instead point, society word that. Everyone says stuff like this, doesn’t work. shtf. Source: HVAC contractor Well, assuming he's wearing mask like Batman comics/movies/shows Batman styled mask, would cover everything mouth nose lol. sucks, went try normal stuff seen people without masks like fuck this, went home.  really normal ICU care.  wear N95 P95 insight likely NY add Maryland quarantine list? can’t issue rent vouchers something people instead $600 cash? way least money go landlords problem phrase longer means originally did. phrase never intended mean ""say yes customers every possible request"". meant hear reasonable amount consumers asking product service, likely good market thing.

I'm sure turned customers thinking able get whatever want whenever want it, that's entirely problem. wife mentioned 2020 missing “big one” California. Yikes! less staff weekend. one's hidng anything, like weekend originally told wear mask work-- CDC. ya, messaging shit. Yea 75 exponential spreading virus close harsh enough. That's lot contact tracing considering many people 75 would contact potentially showing symptoms. 


For me, 5 seems like reasonable limit. know exact precautions others taking better. I'm seeing local family, 2 households, monitoring closely going. Theres still risk course, reasonable reduce it. *are* dumb? Thank input. Nah there’s consequences utter stupidity un-American insurance companies get fair chance fucking you.

Getting fucked corporations badge honor country. Look many people love getting ass-raped Apple regular basis. can't use reason dislodge someone position use reason get into. federal government considering York Governor Andrew Cuomo said interview CNN Saturday night tactic questionable legality would amount less “federal declaration governor, I’m going close borders,” added.

And sub praises guy. live US upset can’t go countries, might want read places go within country. There’s many amazing things see here.

That said, best time interstate travel. fact one moment may myth next. definitely see older people struggle modern facts; many today's truths outlandish myths past. go stand outside? I'd wager poor physical fitness threat health covid-19. It’s hard Governor fire scientists manipulate data. They’ve whole time. Americans shocked get travel banned Cases rising are. places people understand want nice things need suffer inconvenience. favorite '+950 cases, surge 945 cases yesterday' Life good bad. That's nature. Even take humans, good bad still exists. Lions eat gazalles, fox's eat chickens, coyotes kill sheep, snakes eat mice. could go day. even breeds wasps anihilate entire bee colonies.

It's dog eat dog world there.

People say well let's let nature run course humans interfere.

Humans part nature mean think came from? came existence planet. We're part animal kingdom.

Of species Earth we're one ones mental capability override natural instincts think morally good.

Then argue philosophy morally good changes depending live culture part of. 

Life's complex lot s***** get there's lot beautiful too.

We every right animal does.

And ability learn get better.  store me, would no-negotiation policy. Masks store leave.

But state hasn’t really given true repercussions stores people wearing masks, lot shop owners aren’t willing risk customers legal action. It’s frustrating. might grain truth ventilator thing, ventilators over-used early on, may increased death rate.  masks causing breath CO2 catch pneumonia... that's pure conspiratorial bunk. absolutely right, entertain masses constantly dog piece shit trump. Thankfully that's two social media platforms hear anymore. you, perhaps people would take seriously learned spell correctly. exactly. argument people vote team fix problem, double decision team gets ignores problems. tEsTinG dOuBlEd. Sweden wear masks all. that's government experts critical masks beginning. say help all. cannot tell much better mental health kid started camp week is. Even restrictions, seeing people person transformed them. mathematically would middle February 2022. :-) 
But know know model breaks way that.

7 * ( ln(6000000000/9822372) - ln(1 - (9822372/8673072)^(-1/7)) ) / ln(9822372/8673072) = 588.0 days Seriously coronavirus taskforce held briefing two months one last week. Pence goes someplace 100 person choir singing president throwing rallies never wearing mask That's interesting perspective. agree overall point however coronavirus, crudely estimated 1 10 suffering longer-term effects even 3 months later. there's reports sustaining permanent organ damage, can't miraculously fix even cutting edge research doctors. tend think high profile stories like come out, perception ""recovery"" means would different, would take seriously. lie really. solutions open indoor space. Ultimately, indoor luxuries going get shit good vaccine thing died off. isn’t viable outcome there. Says moron thinks 50% America unemployed lol. **What 'plague village' Eyam teach us?** 

It teach us BBC seriously invested Fear Porn Cycle Covid-1984. swear...90% anti-mask folk visibly carrying around 100 lbs underlying condition. Everybody dies, lot us die debilitating illnesses. Sometimes get illnesses engaging dangerous unhealthy activities medical professionals advise against, like attending convention enclosed building. simple cause effect. WANT people get sick die, prevent convention happening. Otherwise, cause effect necessarily take over. maybe people want go convention want live 2 weeks. wants aligned, them? love ventilators. exercise lungs use science make living easier. bullshit, lazy disingenuous. make one os old tshirt  folks lament people days soft. cant even wear simple mask.... hate laugh this.  force people refuse wear masks wear ventilator. Karen going Karen, talk reasoning walk away let be. easiest way neither They're stubborn want sacrifice literally anything. Barbecues literally putting people hospital people real good pretending apply want thing. Would please go shake hands sick people comfort them? tell truly humanitarian. getting news reddit informed “idiot test” thinking outdoor transmission serious risk. added cannot guarantee vaccine - phase one two clinical trials done China - ultimately commercialised.

Looks like Phase 3 trial going consist ""inject soldiers hope best"". used proud fact America allowed criticize America much want without fear repercussion. apparently un-American. political dicussion. talking wearing masks, USA become politicized. whole post must removed comment removed problem, alright, need support heh! Forcefully locking citizen, making disappearing journalist, killig people lagers.. justice system, social credit scores... yeah, superior, doubt.

Reddit: Exponential growth!11! 38 billion cases per day 2 weeks!

Also reddit: continue dozen years! First phase vaccine studies always low samples. Then, promising safe, scale phase 2 3. Licking doorknobs illegal planets  appreciate it! Masks ignored, worn chin, nose... Whereas closed business, there's zero chance spread inside business. Weeee haavveeeeee winnnnnnaaaaaaaa little bit time naps hour usually spend time chores. I'm saying COVID-19 worse Spanish Flu, im saying thats poor benchmark time spanish flu

\-We discovered invention germs viruses

\-Healthcare pretty much non existent

\-Tracking virus spread nowhere near precise

\-It during/immediately great war massive global travel, shit sanitation conditions, bombed destroyed infrastructure, many people already barely hanging on

There's really countless reasons here, ignore fact totals spanish flu 2 years, meantime we've several potential near pandemics better handled. come virus much better spreading, think there's benchmark call even ""OK"" even slightly comparable spanish flu catastrophe. think bad. numbers real them. Yeah, people die, world literally explode event supporters left take proof bad. 

Not mention big state, and, ""if report deaths, deaths result event!"" forget Uyghurs! customer always right supposed mean consumer desires drives market; nobody orders fish, probably come menu.

It misinterpreted mean people act like entitled jackasses towards service staff can't *wrong*. really work. bar exam largely consists information learn law school (sort of) via intense study exam (more so). learn information actually practicing law, use information practicing law.

So anybody year removed law school working full time can't devote tons time studying going far harder time passing exam would normal circumstances. info left lot people's heads point.

It's kind bum deal around.

IMO kind online, open-book strictly timed version rolled nation-wide agreement states. Actually practicing law open-book, would big deal. test seem weird. ""We're one lawyers pass bar exam?"" might good question ask barristers thinking hiring near future. ;)  Honestly, think cut back bus transportation much possible, parents capable transport kids themselves. know cover everyone, still need buses, lot parents could make work. inconvenient, hell lot less inconvenient remote schooling. IMO, it’s even necessarily see separates them. It’s want good things continue without work paying taxes. greatly simplify one aspect Roman decline, Rome’s military class preferred stay home villas hired Germanic mercenaries instead paying legions. Stuff like weakens foundations, eventually push would easily weathered early days enough topple them. sounds like awake, tired point can’t move. hope mind isn’t alert, would prison. saw guy grocery store Trump 2020 face mask, standing line behind another guy came asked bought apparently local place makes them. huge measure Trump's incompetence letting private businesses profit stupidity could cash cow. lived Florida whole life, here’s think. Florida comprised almost entirely staters relocating here. Basically “Florida Man/Woman” stories hear likely reject another state. Whenever hear one stories almost guarantee it’s someone relocated here. It’s used pretty cool state lots natural beauty honestly state ruined exploding growth.  Swallowed pills man, freaked went hospital saved life. Dont it, worth it, go sit sun outside woods listening favorite music, thank past self irrational, good luck, friend.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yup. See: Ellen clip Bill Gates guess price grocery items gets almost extremely wrong.

He idea anything costs, anything works level hoi polloi. contact normal human world decades, neither ultra-wealthy ilk. Question. businesses owner customer? field?

I ask met many irate business owners met angry customers people want use patronize services. Many business owners smart people understand situation. know bad yes, devastated destruction virus caused. Many us denial, thinking government cause problems business. virus destroyed economy, government trying help save lives inevitable economic destruction. 

Very business owners know talked extremely angry blaming government. boy customers real mad can't get thing want. know cause hear them. even want tell shut order. let think government, otherwise angry giving service. Many try go around law, wanting open something similar. complain unfair destroying small businesses like me. pretend protective want haircut margarita whatever.

Business owners devastated. customers loud hell complain lot forums like this, pretending represent us, terrible us. Thanks I'll complaining business losses thank you. take care yourself. No, best case scenario, vaccine fall, vaccinate everyone number months pandemic (at least 1st world countries).

Then Bill Gates whoever else pays manufacture ship vaccine around world gone elsewhere within year. Cross immunity due previous exposure corona viruses? Tcells. Looks like 197 degrees F quickly kill virus, food oven least temp probably inside take-out container. Cold foods salads def higher risk though. personally problem hot food take point anything sort warm cold seems risky. Resorting using codewords avoid censorship? China? Get /r/coronavirus, epicenter gloom doom Well whisper name hug girlfriends Freedom run around chase Darwin Awards like they’re Pokémon. Again. Shitty human practices that. concept animal ""agriculture"".

You rally support ethical treatment animals would right side history that. Personally can't wait jump factory / lab meat wagon. 

But saying meat industry cause disease, stupid. ignores things like bats naturally live extremely close one another. Like thousands thousands tiny enclosed space sort close. excellent immune systems, carriers hundreds diseases without suffering them.

In fact lack standardized ""bat meat"" industry reason disease carried humans. shop, factories, shops government would incentivized produce meat kill customers. US uses liters. Maybe visit us sometime (when safe) instead making ignorant glib comments internet.

Plus supervise worksheet assignments make sure got done questions answered.

She says remote learning next year probably take year work supervise better, feels like neither work kids' education got attention needed trying juggle that.  think needs accepted humans capable self-governance. We're emotional frankly smart enough effectively. Maybe AI could better. heartbreaking.. Y'know sometimes get really angry. 

Almost 3 years ago finally got clean heroin. baby, went back school, fixed credit score.... 


Just time Covid19 man come-on. Good like trying change everyone's minds convincing half country wear masks something practically worth starting civil war over. saw depressing poll numbers: 60% Americans said would take vaccine, 27% said wouldn't. Since president's poll numbers seem hover around 40% (i.e., including, 13%-gap, assume ""I knows""), I'm guessing likely many 40% Americans refuse vaccinated.

This means able vaccine enough US reach herd-immunity via vaccination, thing continue unabated, especially since unlikely given vaccine 100% effective. right? Reddit kind worst honestly. Biden Trump. one who's fucking idiot please Oh they're all. he’s playing napping? free time sit make sure he’s okay maybe reading playing game interests you? So. Much. Winning. It’s probably already 100,000 definitely lawyer, don’t clauses require declaration emergency government lines reasons pulling contract? experience totally opposite. see around half 2/3 people wearing neighbourhood. world record fastest vaccine measles 4 years. know technology improved point heard much happy talk decision making process driven past performance rather wishful thinking. cases positivity rates accelerating dramatically! BLM protests/rallies held would widespread condemnation, even African American community dying twice rate whites. 3 4 weeks ago many states believed stabilized &amp; plateaued case load would increase single digits.

And America highest infection rates...

Sure.. Noble cause. 

One man dies - Lets make sure 100 000 die. I'm already betting bad fire season California year wet winters we've had. We'll see come September-November typical fire season. oddly high concentration morons like made Florida appendix United States. It’s making us sick, serves purpose otherwise, inexplicably collection point undesireable dreggs. Hopefully doesn’t explode election kill us diseased influence roils within. surgery option. 

It’s also wonder Florida Trump’s favorite state. bet can’t even name states begin remembers Florida becase looks like imaginary, giant, grotesque cock wishes could replace wannabe dictator micro-penis with. situation isn’t bad. asinine. asthma too! Yay pre-existing conditions! It’s already one leading causes annual mortality it’s even full year. it’s brand new. That’s insane. brain seem capable comprehending gravity situation. expected. There’s reason many guys helping keep virus spreading. covid kills 10-15% people 70, 3.4 million would lower bound estimate deaths age group alone. everyone got it, healthcare system would completely buckle take every preventable death, covid otherwise, along it. late. Panties bunched. operating loss hospital far eye watering. hope lots federal grants telling us lay us off. pulse oximeter keep eye blood oxygen? temp constant without fever reducer?

Hope feel better soon either way.
Fellow Pinellas/Hillsborough  God damnit. NAACP's, NRA, NOW, AARP...stop get one matches audiences interest. there's anything bad form representation way change come about. Buckets bribe money seem effective. wrong yep that's exactly is. convenient excuse - people masking regardless gubment said. don’t think implying that. OP asked happened California, that’s happened. Better giving everyone license Alternatively, understanding virus wrong.

This HIV. HIV largely asymptomatic beyond initial infection.

What virus zombie virus causes host issues one issues interstitial double lung pneumonia mostly associate virus. elderly susceptible pneumonia became understood virus.

But even pneumonia normal pneumonia. drowning blood. mechanism causing rashes children believed causing pneumonia adults. I've seen people saying going rush get haircut case gets shut too.  mention health parents teachers all? told Americans March would 130,000 deaths July, would getting started would mass panic. definitely become desensitized Yes, also cases 28th ECDC sheet either.

Can agree number reported 24th 25th June sources?

ECDC: 1905, 1487 
FHM: 1699, 1228

Why difference two days? central leadership kind good thing. US many ways similar Europe, individual country. state situation. Applying rules whole country even state’s situation vastly different bit silly. States different outbreak levels, population densities, climates, cultures, economies, etc. trying dictate one size fits solution without expert state. would silly treat Montana New York.

It absurd consider non-mask wearer murderer. pretty much everyone Denmark murderer definition. prioritize initially, public still don’t wear them, never implemented. 

If experts don’t agree, feel sure? understand saying. also look facts pertaining it. Gilead already Remdesivir Designed (for ebola) years ago. spent several months tests realized may effective Covid 19. tests conducted US government, US govts cost (in addition money received bill back march), overseas testing also managed funded US government. yes cost billions develop treatments, adapting already extant pharmaceutical new purpose. developing scratch costs entail. Almost every expenditure date testing it/adapting covid ebola US govt expense, Gilead. initial pricing ebola set much much lower, jacking know market bent backwards get it. Especially experiment PLA it.  make online test well understood? research cotton masks coronavirus? think literally paying attention hospitals, victims, anything else.

The media general seems covering less. New York's peak period, news articles, videos, etc.. bad things are. see coverage Houston Tucson. sight, mind, suppose. getting sick sure....have it, get sick. spread it, overwork hospitals it. RP-a noted nut. worse dad nutso. really want Biden win blame economic collapse him. was/is big one Argentina last days. fair say relatively common, happening twice every decade. ""My opinion important everyone else's, thus font size larger everyone else's."" Yeah, study Black Death (aka Bubonic plague) history class research paper incredible lengths people go prove stronger bullied what's causing death. Like, government quickly learned mass burials needed done night people would flock stand pits proving scare them. *rolling eyes* Clearly, people changed much. Yeah Bill dumber think!!!! God help us  Sweden’s strategy beginning went horribly “changed” it. 
Healthcare free low income people that’s barrier access. wait till riots/uprisings start.

I know heard already couple riots. 

Not related housing crisis, people edge. social systems currently buckling. Masks times public places people around default standard, additional businesses pose increased risk still significant spread, like bars restaurants, also closed top that. Dude. girlfriend works high end restaurant people come probably worse hood. There's nation happens. Even 1950's kids still went school stay home parent. quit Facebook last month thing although tempting get back first days, life's better without it. live Florida, imagine stupid shit people around me, even friends family, posting. stress levels gone significantly, highly recommend it. 

The thing miss right (but useless since I'm self isolating) events sections. use heavily things do, concerts, art shows, etc. Maybe find alternative platform find info. complete extermination goal playing 'realistically'. Killing 20% country (70+ million Americans) would devastating. No. work. limiting factor fast spread hospital capacity.  let run wild, hospitals quickly become overwhelmed need shut economy again. don't, people die street waiting beds. can't leave economies open. States tried. paying stupidity now. viable choices slowing spread masks shutdowns. I’m take permanent sleep That's thought since start It’s another rolling pattern. Weeks ago rushing line bars, they’re rushing line hospital beds want protest something, wear ventilator then? admitted already, need defend him. [Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, confirmed public-health experts discouraged public wearing face masks towards beginning coronavirus Awesome. could use 1 Trillion dollars forgive student loan debt. assume deaths lag positive confirmation two weeks, case count Jun 15th 1758.

58/1758 fatality rate 3.2%, that's without hospitals overwhelmed. Projecting forwards would imply 194 deaths two weeks now, assuming hospitals remain within capacity.

To put another perspective, 203353 Florida residents died 2017, averaging 557 day. 58 deaths would represent 10% daily average. thought funny split between

* Lock everything forever, stay home, go take precautions and

* Open up, pretend virus exist, take precautions


Whenever said something like maybe could open little actually wore masks, conducted business outside, temperature checks (I know, catch close everything), encouraged testing/sick leave, etc would get horrified downvotes sides. mean yeah kind of. Humans social creatures goes nature There’ll outcry too. Except can’t literally outcry appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Covid1984 = 0.2% mortality

Common flu = 0.1% mortality

Stop overreaction paranoia. scam says possible😭 widespread supply masks, effectiveness masks stopping COVID well understood. know now, recognize masks one effective tools everyone wears them. Wow, read shit states, appreciate tri-state area. Never thought I'd say that, handled shit. Lab mice past decade problem freakishly long telomeres. result lab mice prone cancer less prone tissue damage humans good test subject used be. That’s uh...not ideal Lol okay. Take chill pill Building whats already happening, considering pandemic, well, powers practically begging, *begging*  reasonable reform would get rid tipping, created South civil war keep newly-freed former slaves paid proper wage services. Boost liquor server min wage match general min wage, charging slightly higher prices matches expected tipping amount, really customer pay already tax tip (unless they're under-tipping first place). 2-3 weeks ago local CV went totally bare, Texas became hotspot suited again.

my local Tom Thumb grocery removed social distance decals re-install 2 weeks later.

leadership, lacking! I’m cool posting it. NYT published it, it’s free us discuss.

I’m annoyed published start though, given attitudes country. It’s excess mortality using something called ”z-score”. 

From EuroMomo page linked second tweet thread:

“Z-scores used standardize series enable comparison mortality pattern different populations different time periods. standard deviation unit measurement z-score. allows comparison observations different normal distributions.

In general, Z-score = (x-mean population)/Standard deviation population, could approximated context S-score = (number deaths - baseline) / Standard deviation residuals (variation number deaths around baseline) part series used fit model, used standard unit.” China declared vaccine make global public good. So, given analysis ""lax US standards"", take personal ability trust NPR, NYT, WasPo, FDA, CDC etc. Got it. Similarity one wants wear mask ventilator unless forced to. Half people ‘murica don’t even believe evolution. might well talking wall. Godzilla would help, good girl. usually 75 - 80% gets tossed around. Yeah, need stay stealth while. Let cases skyrocket deaths drop, say, like US. Get people saying ""see, dangerous"" lower guard. got infection uncontrollable, put everything lethality. Exhibit somebody see little joys life.

Tell me, fucking miserable right now? so, possibly think worth knowing know virus? not, please tell enjoyment meaning possibly derived life past 4 months send people given vaccine local grocery store walk around ask people politely wear masks. get retaliation coughed couple dozen times.

I’m waiting whining start... “other countries opening everyone still closing borders Us!?” Yeah, hey, no. Chinese dictatorship may work fine military grade situations, like pandemic, dead end long run. Dictatorships end corruption destroys whichever power stays long. western govt actually handling situation perfectly fine, without human restriction China applied citizen. balance. USA China none. Stamp Act 1765 Tea Act 1773 also minor inconveniences selfish, ungrateful colonists dared throw bunch perfectly good tea Boston Harbor. teens whose parents care spend time friends making risky decisions. true, Trump voters around everyone else essential places like grocery stores without masks spreading everyone. hurts everyone.  


Next see huge rise numbers going suppress voter turnout going help party still shows believe Covid worse seasonal flu. 100,000 new cases daily? Natural selection Imagine movie 2012 called 2020. Yeah, China prioritize vaccinating military instead risk citizens land grab! agree. Let's see 4th July goes.

We useless attempting enforce guildlines compared most.

I wonder cheap holidays Europe pan too..

The public unruly selfish majority. John Hopkins. Though I've read it, selection criteria sketchy. fundamentally trust study ranks Brazil higher Singapore epidemic control measures.  lol love people say 'this case' proven case instead saying 'oh wrong then,' continue on, bleating furiously something stupid already proven wrong about. Loosening them? I'm camp protesting safe needed.

We’re going seeing lot next year. people embarrassed elected officials allowing happen one richest nations Earth. 70-90% depending R0

Edit: noticed scott gottleib. Guy total moron, telling people go fly commercial airlines without masks march . Ignore messaging confusing

The issue giving rise public debate. still many health experts maintain public need wear surgical masks, people countries like China do, cases, could give people false sense security.

Some public health experts say wearing face mask actually causes people touch face more, bad spreading virus.

""I'm side general public wearing masks general rule,"" said microbiologist Kelly Reynolds, professor University Arizona's Mel Enid Zuckerman College Public Health. ""The data support effective broad population.""

One problems universal mask-wearing public could wearing mask prolonged period time, Reynolds said, increase rather decrease chances getting exposed virus. mask may become virus-collecting source infection.

""What actually concentrating virus mask time,"" said. ""You could exposing inadvertently.""

But message public confusing: need surgical mask, health care workers do.

The reason health care workers advantage social distancing, said Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine, medical director disease control Maricopa County Department Public Health.

""We health care workers front lines need masks protect stand right front people actively coughing sneezing very, sick,"" said.

""They care option standing six feet away them. would like preserve masks health care workers. part living community people highest risk getting exposed need protection.""

If unlimited supply masks, Sunenshine said personally would still choose wear one public.

""My daughter, asthma — would wear mask public,"" Sunenshine said. ""I think benefits outweigh discomfort possibility would get contaminated. personal recommendation family."" This. ""They need around kids"". one stopping play dates one friends. Theres huge difference packing bunch kids classroom. Allegedly alot young people positive. America...if get way....I sue... everyone! Reddit getting mad virus deadly now, lmao Well Sweden healthcare free everyone. Sweden’s strategy herd immunity. consequence Swedish strategy herd immunity though. dad biochemist seen this, people overdosing cocaine drinking alcohol, really bad body.

People bene overdosing think easy painless really awful. get good immunised. read research behind it, children passing adults. almost always way around. teacher safer classroom full children socially distanced faculty meeting. 

As turns out, dropping kids Grandma's problem, parents accompanying them. 

I making up. literally scientific literature experts say. Two days POTUS say kidding all. think Swine flu taken MUCH seriously among general population targeted young well. damaging article. It’s like economy rushed opened anything. protests people getting virus. Really ironic. sad true. friend lives Oregon. 

he thinks number deaths fake .

thinks soros,gates,democratic plan.

fuci devil...... 

i got point talking stop. 

(the break-en point 5 g cause covid)

his whole mind set change covid started becoming thing. cant believe amount morons pretending possible. pandemic people going mental agree. CNN too, right? Goes straight FEMA bunker masks ventilators. World's bigliest underground supply beautiful medical thingies. gonna trickle soon, see /s Ikr? Like sure, billionaires go, guess Gates fine. like problem trying get vaccines poor kids. gonna billionaire, seems like pretty good thing it.

That change reality he's touch rest world, medical experience get sick completely different 99% world ultra-rich.

But course, polarized times, people can't hold two complex thoughts head time. frustrating. I'll keep washing hands, avoiding high risk behaviors social distance. Wearing mask solve issue. see news people's home welded imagine that's case across China, reality media cherry picked stories. Use brain hard realize rediculous force 1.4b people home. even send military like US did. need tell people truth: people die. Proper education mentally prepare people, enough community workers daily food delivery. understand western government sit ass make excuses. actually, 1,741 positives, exact Well, yes. _really_ sure _China_?  seem case? acceptable extent? think lives matter others? many deaths ""acceptable"" exactly? understanding, neither anything special terms contact tracing social distancing. Mask usage may I’ve monitoring live cams it’s universal. Still, reopened countries would think you’d see spike isn’t all. think whole thing bringing spotlight entirely different nearly significant problem: American people trust leadership supposedly choose. 

A huge fear many, conservative liberal alike, action justified today abused line. there’s good reason fear that, saw action post 9/11 day. 

Add deep widening divisions people personal political level we’ve got big problem. 

This distrust addressed dealt point we’re pretty well dead water far emergency response goes. It’s bad COVID imagine much worse could without type unity face much deadlier pressing threat. 

I don’t believe it’s possible address problems without solving first. even begin reunite build trust, idea. Let’s see Mitch motivate something. Following Florida tradition polling stations get results want. local news site constantly see people saying ""locking caused deaths people inside houses virus spreads family members sources"" tried explain virus magically climb window infect one family member, family member get public location work, etc data world showing locking lowered case counts.. shutting indeed lower amount people bringing virus home families, locking cost lives. listen? ofcourse not, fake news consiparacy. even published local doctors article talking facemask misconceptions providing data. people tthe comments still care one bit refused wear mask say ""point single double blind study says masks works"" despite literally many studies right masks despite explaiend 100s times still claim ""masks even protect you"" would live rock know mask prevent spreading virus others........ constantly take one statistic look surface level critical thinking spout notions really make sense, people believe affirms already believe.  *Another Neo-Puritan entered chat.* I've worn ventilator (almost died sepsis kid). extremely unpleasant experience. Every time friends razz refusing come out, remind brief period alert ventilated, tried prevent nurses assisting wanted die. Wear fucking mask people. secret flu coronaviruses capable pandemic level spread detected increasing rates, blamed largely practices modern industrial farming.

People always hate hear matter statistically supported is, I’ll likely downvoted, really gotta pull back consumption factory farmed animal products. vector viruses (swine flu, mad cow disease, bird flu), it’s one main contributors global warming.  weren’t idiots, wouldn’t living Milton. likely infected protest since noticed symptoms day after, evidence purely anecdotal. fact cases going places number beds taken Corona virus patients same. Prior 50% cases came nursing homes. Wearing mask easy way get this, think likely entire population gets over, ever over. found [the it. enemy biological weapon, think faux patriots would problem masks

If Trump thought way. ""Wear FREEDOM mask protect China Flu"" would clever. I'm implying anything you. I'm saying people eating Applebee's, local restaurants, pubs. eating Michelin star restaurants create sauces entire day. I've worked kind restaurants people going (as cook manager), tell cheffy flourishes seeing Applebees local sit steak house remotely hard home right ingredients instructions. Great zinger, story keep hearing pub health people mask protects others *from* you.

So line doesn’t really work format Funny countries didn’t attention span gnat actually locked able shut down, recover, reopen still thumbs asses wondering it’s real. half-assed every step way it, stuck purgatory open certain annoying restrictions, cases deaths surge. Crying things open even regardless medical reality exactly economically multiple steps behind countries committed actual quarantine. knows much follow reporting media anything detailed. beginning coworkers talked virus like big deal media wants scare us. one coworkers said “this whole virus thing washing hands go bathroom” made think maybe people need scared little can’t bothered wash hands wiping butt. true, that's masks for. Basically facemasks outside make wayyyy safe  B/c said landlords also pay banks, banks pay debt/collateralization notes held privately books sold secondary. Banks business owning properties ;), even small amount books (portfolio loans) disaster situations like this. whole domino effect. Even personally bank private bank notes held privately portfolio. 

That's think people realize perma shutdown mess actually backend. consult secondary deal syndications one businesses. already verge another collapse, Covid sped make 10x worse. I'm seeing backend, high chance stupid ugly next 12-24 months. talking CMBS financial syndications basically collapsing. Commercial debt defaults already skyrocketing including South FL. commercial debt especially credit bubble (which even worse covid), next true bubble actually burst similarly residential real estate notes 07/08. Heck people stopped paying walked away 500k-1m+ properties, think they'll care credit cards 10, 20, 50k etc, nope. Credit bubble gunna go BOOM.

Just like jobs. buddy kept job, 40% pay cut, executives 50% pay cut, founders taking salary bonuses next 12 months. cliente hurting, clienteles deal others on, full domino effect parties affected. reports asymptomatic people may still suffer damage lungs. really means asymptomatic may contagious symptomatic. Norway? Sure. Mexico... ehh tried assassinate someone Mexico City freaken grenade launcher *Most* organizations know UN. rightfully pointed Global Hunger Agency provide data. that's true. 

Also: ""rising famine concerns"" *not* mean higher death toll letting virus run rampant, overloading hospitals, watching several times people die virus. That's there's consensus among health experts. 

Once again, claiming economic damage worse would happen without lockdown. Texas, Florida, Arizona proven that, end lockdown, end prolonging problem needed shutdowns. 

If want make claim, give comparison two. Otherwise, drawing assumptions based half story. jealous. local sushi place near closed offer take location. take second location, delivery convenient get to. craving good fresh sushi. bright side, State pass emergency amendment allows cocktails takeout. call person graduates last class? Doctor.

Doctors study infections take place, treat patients. I've worked enough doctors know many complete idiots. Masks used limited situations social distancing cannot take place. general public masks become cross contaminated concentrates virus properly disposed contaminated.

Have ever stopped doing, observed people around public wearing masks noticed behavior? great majority people wearing masks (a) wearing appropriate masks provide protection ever (b) cross contaminating masks touching face often. take word it, go place like Costco, grocery store, etc look around observe people doing.

Example cross contamination contradicting messaging confusing

The issue giving rise public debate. still many health experts maintain public need wear surgical masks, people countries like China do, cases, could give people false sense security.

Some public health experts say wearing face mask actually causes people touch face more, bad spreading virus.

""I'm side general public wearing masks general rule,"" said microbiologist Kelly Reynolds, professor University Arizona's Mel Enid Zuckerman College Public Health. ""The data support effective broad population.""

If unlimited supply masks, Sunenshine said personally would still choose wear one public.

""My daughter, asthma — would wear mask public,"" Sunenshine said. ""I think benefits outweigh discomfort possibility would get contaminated. personal recommendation family."" believe hype. stay safe, stay smart, wear bloody mask! Oh, seem like law suits coming  Wow, talk selfish crybaby. far off. state budget mostly funded property sales taxes. gave formula. output gave correlation coefficient misinterpreted R-squared. Regardless, fit extremely close. Give linear function fit points better. I'll wait. Well places big outbreaks listen expert close them. close everything, least move lock back phase fewer things open. 

Of course seems easy write, realize willing situation is. 😞 Doesn’t take expert know this... ~~protests~~ riots happened across America.

The ~~protests~~ riots happened c-o-m-m-u-n-i-s-t-s radicalizing youth misinformation emotionally edited video clips cen-sor-sh-ip Fair enough, think funny people get emotional anything pro Trump way mentioned. thought reacting emotionally original response. Masks, contact tracing social distancing. every country fairly successful cutting knees. Alas US use time wisely screwed government fellow citizens can't seem understand need think others put g.d. mask. stupid continues!

They track people throw em jail falsely practicing medicine shit. came pretty much say this.. bankers Feds listen. Thanks BLM! I'm saying comes devastation yes. That's take genocide seriously. larger portion society dies crisis devastating is. Sorry, nothing Sweden. may seem weird ‘trivia’ I’m speaking uncounted deaths pandemic.

Edit: uncounted, unrecognised. Stories like reinforce important Oxford China get vaccine first Holy fuck...I'm shock... best friend grew one antivax, Bill Gates “literally Satan himself” people. wasn’t always like this, slowly happened years really escalated situation. also parents somewhat converted, recently brought consequences. father may may COVID-19 shortly first case officially diagnosed US. severe pulmonary fibrosis 5L O2. diagnosed flu pneumonia ended hospitalized little week, really touch go days. could’ve also COVID-19, never know. father seek medical attention incoherent barely conscious, brothers pick load car drive ER. “pumped full antibiotics”, would’ve would’ve ordered vitamin C drip. Whether covid along flu, he’s going die thinks modern medicine farce. won’t ever tell that, knows better live it. That's totally fair. certainly worth arguing about. Wearing masks, even relatively short period, help reduce risk transmission. hope people, especially vulnerable, take time educate themselves, blindly trust government guidelines protect them. Fair enough. Source? even go water NJ 2 weeks ago cold  mean, wearing mask asinine, charge asinine amount - $5,000. 

The point “just wear fucking mask”. it’s much bother, obviously don’t need store. 0 sympathy people complaining mask usage wife, who’s nurse, pregnant asthma wears one 14 hours day hospital. 

I get it, masks aren’t comfortable, especially summer heat wear every store. shopping quickly I’m take off. It’s slight inconvenience something that’s proven work. comment made lot people extremely mad Gates much perceived benevolent billionaire.

And that, unpopular suggest power privilege people.

It weird thing upset about. Yeah, clear differences they're developed naturally cut time development COVID vaccine, like simultaneous phasing. Also keep mind basically every virologist world working one disease, time. We've never seen anything like history.

It's happy talk optimistic we'll something much less 4 years. real concrete reasons that's expected case. you, rich asshats policy makers decided control lives next X amount months.

And I'm saying, ignore that... look needs done good others it. wait told respect impact others' health long okay humans treating one another disease vectors avoided?

Is really view what's necessary protect others? 3 weeks earlier....  Ha 🙃 Never think apocalypse would come form low budget b-rate movie People worried it.

Some studies suggested least protests seem contribute spread, others show signs increased spread. specifically set many people wore masks doubt effect.

I support efforts protests, timing many people cooped work contributed success way times, reality mass gathering pandemic dangerous.

A 4th July celebration, however, important context risking spread. essential, something fun.

A protest people getting murdered cops moment relevant events people protesting fresh everyone's mind lot value argued much essential important. People targeted killed color skin going willing risk exposure virus much more, reality protesting urgently pressing issue them. herd immunity happening faster ‘experts’ understand measure

All 70% numbers theories...yet run absolutes

The experts wrong pretty much everything thus far crisis. ➡ /r/iamverysmart rioting made stores close temporarily resulting less people shopping. Target close/change hours nearly 200 stores that's one company. Deaths still really low compared NY tho right?? 

How possible thought everyone old dirt FL ""We're done helping you. Go risk family's lives paycheck can't live without. Enjoy shitty maskless Karens screaming face day!

Oh, *you* go fun deal stress used cannon fodder economy, pandemic fault."" link, tell data portrayed? Deaths? Cases? ICU admissions? read Swedish, actually say. DONALD FUCKING STUPID?

I'm really worried getting coronavirus there, see many people grocery restaurant... mention churches still gather large groups point. hair nail salons cannot social distance? closed?

I get point. shutdown makes sense. bars waterparks schools, social distancing difficult maintain due either influence around kids poor understanding social distancing. Upvoted guess wasn’t me. FAR likely die serious injury though maybe feared irrational fear. Shows easily thing spreads. keep contained staying shut down, start reopening seems matter time virus takes hold. Lockdown 400k, admit 12 new infections today. makes sense anyone? add 100% correct, don’t support prohibition. alcohol creates problems millions people per year believe freedom freedom choose. key education, treatment, people hopefully personally responsible.

Lol, really? Nothing all? Well, even individual knows more, governments work like that. act intelligence data, handed case China - corrupted late.

Personally, I'm shocked people give crap. I'm used Mitch McConnel horrible. re-read title multiple times make sure reading correctly. It’s common Illinois. Can’t speak rest country though. Gallup's measure consumer stock ownership based question asking respondents individual stocks may own, well stocks included mutual fund retirement savings account, like 401(k) IRA.

It's not. Right Reddit talking specific stocks, generic money thrown started job I've never done shit sense someone told leave alone. Thanks sourcing wrong though. terrible. response hospital restate policy cell phones banned critical care areas.

Blows mind it’s business health; require staff wear masks. 

And there’s gym goers. naive believing health. one wearing masks gym revealing vain ignorant are.

So, cancel I’m looking smaller business local gym owner actually gives fuck health. t. Reductionist.  great initiative. Literally nobody could even begin speculate question like that. California something similar weekend. least San Diego area vocal fraction group love spout ""tax increases paid children, grandchildren"". larger fraction actually buy line. actually care younger generations' financial well being.

It's question value country.

We either go ""Fuck you, got mine"", tilt policies successive generations easier, even causes current generations discomfort.

When vote, try approach standpoint ""How would affect child, grand-child?"". know time limited. I'm already middle age.

More people this.

As one example, local proposition ballot 2016 Presidential election raising levy tobacco products significantly, +$2 USD per pack.

I voted increase. $100 per person entry price area really good sot restaurant. $20 app, $50 main, $20 dessert, $20 drinks so. Heck, think could keg. Canadian mind you.

Problem bars people close proximity drinking usually talking loud... guess church could issue singing sure... casinos restaurants spread more. .. def tough line draw. Hi I’m Ken McClure might remember “Oh comes Corona!” “Civilization, Hardly Knew Ye” Dont forget take care mental health well! ride bike, go beach (in evenings crowded keeping distance people), visit parents (outside distanced, masks), regularly get takeout food, things safely. indoor dining dont plan anything indoors many people present masks impossible, cant let cooped nervous wreck either. possible area get tested every reassure youre taking proper precautions, that’s helped enormously. Awww, bad! Well code harder actual hell wrong people.

Oh boy, even start... Here's play out- get proven/approved vaccine, go back work/school, fly airplane travel. don't, retire stay home zero unemployment benefits. Reality care opinions politics.

Mask stop going out. end accommodate virus, way around. 120,000 people died 4 months, like that's significant number anything. laid anyways bailouts. Employees would protected bankruptcy laws physical assets would still there. let fall. also come what's considered third world country. saw news happening China, scared, also rationally getting prepared. hit Europe, third world country mind thought, ""okay, hit developed countries. kind thing usually hits poor countries blows gets ignore. Shit real now."" 

I feel like third world countries deal sorts outbreaks (dengue, Ebola, cholera etc) deadly disease coming killing people far fetched.

I started preparing. Saved money, instructed family cautious, used sick days quarantine early, cases hit state next door, went stock essential supplies panic shopping started. I'm talking evian water good bread here, I'm talking bare essentials, like learned country whenever natural disasters came through.

I shocked appalled badly prepared USA this. came 10. lived 22 years. functionally American, retained culture memories country, could understand nation always considered best people country could fail badly.

I read articles people explained phenomenon feeling ""untouchable"" natural born American. likely product privilege never face national disaster, author claimed. think disasters suffered nation, always seemingly far away, happening another state, people go often watch news. 

Whether that's not, know. trying make sense craziness we're living. speak neighbors always say, ""but kind things happen countries."" also got family calling country asking hell going us. ☹ Norway USA nothing common period. Two totally different nations regarding physical size, population, density, etc. still boggles mind people think USA could manage Norway did.

Here's reliable also provisionally approved, although travel would open Chinese authorities also allowed EU visitors. Reciprocity condition take issue last sentence. logical Corollary people affected disease, higher number people likely fatally impacted disease. holds true even common flu. example something may tangible information tied it. one person driving road, chance get accident another driver obvious reasons, add drivers road, likeliness someone end fatal car crash increases.

Edit: take issue last line, apparently failed reading comprehension. stated tests equal death, cases equal death originally thinking proposing. Carry on. know ICUs really capacity? Area 51 guards play co-op plague inc much. that's born. FTP, Gopher, Telnet, never text *and* graphics screen time.

Sure image support later 1993 Andreessen added Mosaic. 1991 web nothing text hyperlinks asking ""web development"" meant back then. remember basic text hyperlinks ""development"" meant writing article links. Sounds like dream Live free die, eh? [Sweden wants Trump attention span. image revenge. missed Russians putting bounties US soldiers, there's way get's nuances pandemic foresight put mechanism place.

He's narcissistic, monolithic con man programmed Fred Trump find angles make quick buck. Anything beyond paygrade. 1. Nurses don’t treat patients, doctors do.

2. Obviously

3. Things change.

4. coworkers still supporting them.

5. hospitals like that.

6. Choose rate choose fate.

7. isn’t different, still care patients dire need.

8. It’s job, chose profession.

Anything else? would read said already showed it’s true. new ramp cases US going week, it’s given deaths wouldn’t increasing yet. 

I mean, even proposing, would expect daily case rate positive test rate able double *without* uptick death rate trailing after? 

The question referred one well US containing outbreak. chart one measures that. case rate increasing decreasing, means “doing bad job”. Death rate, matter is, change virus spreading faster point pandemic date. 

 **""spike COVID-19 coronavirus cases set daily records twice since Thursday roots days immediately Black Lives Matter protest May 30 downtown""**

What parroting again? way!!!  national positivity percentage 19.5% today. Sure testing 19.5% good!

Ignore idiot high math wrong. Veliko Tarnovo beautiful town, question that. least wait long. virus around one year point, intervening months, learn much more. January, vaccine sight, would feel better proceeding school. awful think waited months, teachers, parents, students could still alive? multiple studies showing opening things like parties correlated rise case, protests.

I never use much salt butter restaurants do, cheffy flourishes make good restaurant great. dying really great food. literally dying, go yet. Hmmm, almost like virus grows exponentially something... Detailed information CDC pertaining Covid-19 pregnancy found people use masks regularly become ill, many restaurants stick to-go models, could see long term change schools operate, companies look work home options... many things couldd long term change well. probably favorite line video game lol. Yup. Generally speaking problem live-virus test false negatives. problem antibody tests false positives. Statistically speaking, think either bit issue. individually, huge issue. Well guess work covid unit. single person one Orlando 107kg. I’ve tuberculosis well around age, frank friend doesn’t compare even remotely. Sorry.

And interestingly post nothing address lack compassion desire keep around safe. telling. FYI. compared 12. would think 10 better 12. don’t? doesn’t look bad chart CNN everyone else referencing. looks pretty flat me. know president company makes bar exam didn’t take bar makes $300k year?

i think nut take pandemic, too! well, even spell username correctly proper grammar probably much ask 😩 25% cold infections believed asymptomatic. herpes 1 2 (""oral"" ""genital"", respectively) infections asymptomatic. related human herpesviruses also largely asymptomatic. lot fun STDs (eg. chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis) largely asymptomatic males cause devastating effects females (namely inability children). HPV largely asymptomatic, handful 200 known types actually presenting symptoms.

Just name few. could seen coming?   hope TIL WSJ article threshold US approve Covid 19 vaccine needs 50% effective placebo. encouraging. What’s less encouraging FDA making point stating publicly, makes wonder (cringe) countries standards might around globe. Would love hear someone informed subject global standpoint. 

Link: (paywalled), would great someone could post content link non-paywalled many researches already figured out: Wear masks = less infected. like every second day news article scientists researchers finding masks actually help.  run under-nose wearers, they're usually employees working essential business. 

Anecdotal:
Just today, multiple grocery store clerks (I saw 3, 7AM practically empty, that's big majority workers floor time) nose. Then, Friday, internet technician, wearing nose, pulling over. 

They're people, non-expert real gathered evidence opinion, wear mandated. I’m 6, wel see hobby goes.... 🤷‍♂️ started fermenting foods too, need grow cabbage cucumbers. mean plague doctor masks? mostly worn doctors, general population. pointed out, many people acting like pandemic happening like somehow affect them. Like now, many businesses, entertainment, forced close. But, happened many entertainment venues opened outside city. fact, much worse things going people selling stuff dead. no, general population little sense came plague. May also stop NHL, likely also stop NFL someone loves misses sports like wouldn’t believe. 

Thanks much people ignoring downplaying problem, you’re reason can’t nice things why: oxford vaccine still asymptomatic carrier spread it, aka false sense security.

[For anyone interested, here's source still hoping something replicated human studies heard criticism, real priority elderly people comorbidities risk dying getting extremely sick covid outweighs risk side effects vaccine.

I'm extremely high risk. Lung disease, extreme defiency, MTHFR, potentially cancer. I'll wait get vaccine. we're wrong affect me, we're impacting life also life mother.

I'm 34 otherwise extremely healthy fit. shit genetics shit luck. lot wiggle room bad roll. Article updated. Phased Re-opening moving backward. ""Risk Level"" updated high risk, different phased re-opening (Phase 4 Improving). confusing. Also, shit storm FB entertaining information fully accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

As aside, think next step region stays high risk long enough phased re-opening stage decreases. Also, hate 1 worst stage use terms like backwards decreasing phase makes sound better, worse. *no shit intensifies* kind does, though??

And graph stops June 22... pretty sure data past seven days gotten grim. I’m disagreeing you. - assuming never find vaccine - health authorities continue prohibit social interaction continue rolling lockdowns, I’m sure matters humans want “human nature” is.

I’m sure point desire socially interact outweigh government mandates. False positives occur time. Better false negatives. actually wish Illinois would well. Open outdoor spaces

Apparently missing part outdoor gatherings packed full people wearing masks? they've already seen problems outdoors open up.   Maybe focustaiwan.tw shitty source. simple google search, China approved terms reciprocity. Weird. Lmao  Best wishes Yep, point TIL balls roll intersections. Water also renders respirators less effective, I’ve seen. Wow. Remember used say ""IF stupidity could kill""? ... kidding, right? Try cooking wines can. wind lot less calories would using butter oil, pretty much can't make food that's tasteless use it. Also works really well less fatty cuts meat use restricted calorie diet, like pork loins chicken breasts. Simple wine stock combinations got dieting still pretty happy got eat, long portion sizes limited filled sides veggies rather heavier foods. Cooking beer good, too; cooking mushrooms beer rather using oil butter works great, example, add lot less calories. sure well works light beers since tried it, even heavier high calorie dark beers bad since using much...a single tablespoon olive oil almost many calories entire glass red wine, half beer, never really need use much either finish single serving. 
  
Easy way get restaurant taste without breaking calorie bank. Yup, elderly immunocompromised people dead here. Definitely. forgot already happened, didn’t you? best shit joke I've seen long time. Thank sir! motherfucker Trump broken human incapable right fucking thing. Literally impossible right thing.  Half deaths directly fault. mask like marking us

""Ma'am, 5g drone scanners big corrupt government marking non-mask wearers facial recognition technology. Wearing mask fights system""

I’ve plenty equipment home never keep consistent workouts. I’ve struggling since March I’m forced workout home resistance bands. Sucks. Hoping gym either changes Covid procedure said above, I’ll waiting vaccine. ""so everyone see respond whites.""

Wow, playing race card also dropping N-bombs. completely agree this.

And that's deepest, darkest scenario. work hospital multiple workers fallen ill. offence anyone thought otherwise US stopped world leader 2016

As American give shit. pathetic Europe need constantly look American difference conduct. FUCK US ‘conservative’ far right govt FUCK people put place.

Days days fatigue. I’m day 9 can’t anything. Daughter tested positive, I’m waiting results know February/March. much worse, then. Lasted 3 solid weeks first time recovered felt absolutely amazing. wait rest much can. Presumably less fun calling demonstrations murdered black people “virtue signalling”. solid, liquid, gas, plasma, fucked long? thing seem get. endless cycle lock down, reopen, lock down, reopen. takes 1 single case whole thing starts again.

The economy cannot support that. People cannot mentally that. way live. whole point lock give hospitals time get ready. Somewhere along timeline shifted ""no one ever get sick"" realistic, practical, possible. No. need people exposed virus test efficacy That's exactly point. every BOH went FOH, fuck's gonna cook food? Man beat it. Take upvote! China hid numbers. imposible believe 4600 deaths since started 6 months ago. true armchair expert would reply ""I know im gonna work you.""

/s... well, slightly Can’t let pesky Los Angeles county take Cook county # cases. Hold Malorts. what? fresh news, doctor's opinion evolution virus. takes millions years think still part news cycle. Hell still Round 1. Round timer. Lol  OK, working vaccine. Let's assume miracle happens Fauci correct (fastest vaccine ever made 4 years, they've never successfully made coronvirus vaccine, like SARS example, two common coronavirus present like common cold). OK, vaccine, produce billions doses, distribute corners world, convince masses accept untested vaccine (from long-term perspective) injection bodies. gotta believe find working vaccine, TON conspiracies people take it, contains long-acting / delayed poisons, tracking devices created Bill Gates (seriously, I've heard one), whatever crazy shit come with.

We reach herd immunity years. Way longer 1.5 - 2 years IMO. No, thing mutants. get ZOMBIES. would characterize evil. Awesome, asshole who's tearing house months I've trying get out.

Fuck guess. mad Mexico starting swine flu pandemic 2009 too? ""Six months ago, none us could imagined world -- lives -- would thrown turmoil new virus,"" chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told virtual briefing.”

I invite research chinaflu sub January February. 10,000 us - easy see going happen globally USA.

Oh yes, imagined well. living imagined reality.

Anyone brain even running 37% capacity saw exactly coming. one single doubt January. 

The conferences March shit show, however. Feel free watch YouTube look said subs here. downplaying like crazy. “The window closing contain virus”... delayed calling pandemic weeks weeks 2 situations guess got away seen peep since.

Globally, embarrassing. shit show, several countries raised rest showed world true leadership looks like. Leadership lacks many places, especially US.

If world-class leader looking new job, US certainly openings. However, job comes one hell mess clean may take decade, health benefits personal security stellar. sometimes honestly hate Mexican-American, hate brown, wish white, worry things, worried kids would deal bullshit.

Man, get saying. I'm proud heritage first-general Korean immigrant became citizen two years ago. However, plenty times feel like life would easier represent whole people every time meet someone.

There's nothing shameful person color. exactly easy live every day, hard think sometimes.

And yet, neither us know like black. That's another matter altogether. Stagehouse? Fairly certain said several times last weeks. Also, I'm sure needed say that. seems pretty obvious us care. scroll right universal health care, free education, workers police robbing murder accept rule International Court Justice,

ICJ war crimes. That's ICC. ICC merely imperialist tool used US powerful European countries go smaller less powerful nations. No, need quite variety ages, especially. good man rare. fuck u salty.......go work front house. fuck u back....

N front house (at least rational ones) would 90% us would always fight BOH wages....

But reform u want? thing thatll help min wage increase. Without min wage increase idk tell u. 

Ain't fucking fault boss government want pay u. fucks sake find weird people want reopen often antimask. would think want reopen would biggest proponenta masks reduce transmissions people out. may lag longer. theory.

We know COVID-19 looks different younger vs old populations. elderly susceptible pneumonia I'm wondering normal disease progression longer younger populations.

It takes less time older immune systems give up. schools can’t open windows. That’s school shooters get in. mad killing numbers ordered find uses it. Like house arrest us, pull shannanagins rights. fucking crazy. Top 12 new cases today. Rolling 7 day average slightly ticked last week. We've flat month. seem like people understand... curve flat measures we're taking. Lifting measures going cause curve rise. Jesus, remember reading article quoting study showing highest concentration virus hospital room change PPE gear. sharing gowns... afraid not....the order applicable Monday always slow day. uses super advanced technology called ""ioni... ionitization"" careless, trying paraphrase Fauci. say antibodies, said ""immune response"", i.e., one capable spontaneously removing virus. sounds optimistic vaccine.

At around Same. I'm ashamed live here. Everyone know voted Trump. Many racist. aunt told last month pray Donald's reelection Biden God would exact vengeance upon us. even know say say nothing. believe virus. news fake news. Surrounded idiocy. Encompassed it. people stupid, idiots. understand. 

Always I've written differences matter political opinion. can't more. stresses I've removed communications friends family. 2020 worst. People can’t even food shop correctly. Restaurants high school level, sadly we’re trouble playing blocks kindergarten. Shit, WRESTLING things still getting taped Hospitals filling capacity quite areas. We've got emergency 3000 beds set right now.

Fuck death. want laying around hospital 1 day two months. Big Ass Fans. really look up. can't bring read it: Article states risk becoming pandemic low (since they're aware such) need take caution identified. sensible person actually believed young &amp; healthy people testing positive... states ICU capacity nearly 90%. many people live work vulnerable people it’s impossible mild cases. think point us live epicenter cities work Jack Box take Metro work never got luxury ""stay home"" communte, live, work places ""social distancing"" possible either. 

There never doubt mind fucked, nobody zip code ever got ""quarantine""

The whole thing never applied lower class, get WFH collect unemployment people decided cooking food hard kept every fast food chain, bodega, liquor store open entire time without proper PPE. Cute way saying need able choose lives dies without getting sued oblivion. erring used here? thank you! God bless America......

A country mess. country perfect, mine far it, US fair share stupid people, seems. knows text came from? Could anywhere world. Yea, calling people shitty humans dicks. 

It’s fun little racket have. rule come “whenever possible”. rules impossible follow. children soldiers. Call is, farce. boondoggle even, anything realistic. afford that? fair, accurate? Sure FOH gets benefit day, back house passed providing equal part guest experience. looot people know anything Germany? great grandfather founded first public library Dresden, might actually first public library Germany I'm sure that. 

Think qualify citizenship? 

I would like jump ship. LA County 10 million people it. San Francisco County 885,000. That's almost 12 times population. live LA see lot people acted like idiots past couple weeks rolled back lockdown. surprise we're reaping sowed. agree things handled better. completely comparing LA County San Francisco simply total number cases. Good social interaction. Potentially liability. difficult kids need wear masks day. humans find new ways adapt. Much like stacking minimum wage top WIC, answer combination programs offers equitable support instead equal support. 

UBI support us (like me) normally live little. think $1200/month okay start, ideally would $2000/month. 

Beyond however, people need form assistance order avoid financial ruin. Students need loan payment interest freezes. Businesses need payroll subsidies and/or low-interest loans. people need cover housing costs need kind help well. 

It's tempting tell well fend themselves, would huge mistake create homeless time like - even could ultimately afford temporary.

Even Barcade Brooklyn go That’s nice Mr Vague. Thank contribution. I'm sure 6 feet effective setting as, say, office, even cuts risk half call joke. *Two weeks*...... we're officially imminent danger It’s almost like virus started China something? 🤪 yes. Following rules literally caused 50% drop salary following rules cause covid therefor cause shutdown. never said exist. good plan reopening really need face reality states posting 1,000 new cases day- School can't open fall exponential growth continues. Florida, Texas, California, Arizona, Alabama show signs virus slowing down- people states need start figuring another semester fall distance learning.  Right, I've heard thing, neuro perspective, would make sense, gives opportunity hard data comparisons, curious what's seen. Well Black Death wasn’t virus intuitively makes sense. LA County slow burning dumpster fire month half. obscured fact rest state well everyone shows numbers state. Idk. Governer shut everything again, it’s already met outrage. “”BuT gOnNa 4tH?” Fucking hate state lately everyone engineers nurses. Someone make pizza. Agreed. I’d say within 2 weeks happening USA. It’s kinda weird he’s looking air conditioning units didn’t look returning infected people back nursing home would kill thousands still best place world live, hands down. rich. \*\*\* 

There fixed you. Masks help reduce community spread. extra breathing people gym negates masks benefit. Well assume civility dignity. rational people expect best!!!


It’s going much watching Florida man beaches 4th July. That’s easy out. It’s complicated masks. indoor strenuous activity extended periods Time Sure. Are/should employers required let know coworker positive? really way we'll able protect everyone. essential workers allowed work except home? tried find don’t see anywhere. also allowed hospitals activate crisis standards care today, it’s pretty bad assume New Yorkers careful this? Chicago slammed like NYC was. wonder every major city need go traumatic experiences like Lombardy, Wuhan, NYC people comply distancing.  think opposition certain face/head coverings might taken long Quebec reach decision. I'm outsider resistance face covers, now, pretty mystifying infuriating me.

Anyways, good news. numbers OK try keep way. Comment/rant:

I like suddenly everyone scientist mathematician...for every article read want throw scientific fact another yielded completely results....for every doctor opinion another exact opposite opinion. 

Numbers lie, do. manipulate graphs many ways make tell version story. tired everyone thinking know what's best everyone providing sources means anything.

The reality know anyone else knows. We're even year thing. one expert, stop pretending. important thing understand risk tolerance act accordingly, sitting around waiting politicians agree something put ordinances, regulations laws. 

At time, respectful. store requires mask want wear one, understand employees may comfortable coming work knew store required patrons wear face masks go store. Shop elsewhere. may right wear face mask, store right refuse service. Obey posted codes would dress code. heart mind right place one. I've read many varying things indoor air currents, fresh air circulation, exposure times jury still best practice, many tv media even mentioning sort thing. print read 20 different articles across 20 different publications, studying twitter feeds bleeding edge scientists, I'm pleasantly surprised hear Cuomo bring context.

For schools, considerations paramount. Europe laughs USA crazy accommodations religion???

Ha ha ha.

And yes, Ireland has member state the European Union since 1973. Europe. live NJ, I'd like know Governor expected, think Bar/Restaurant goers going wear masks whilst ate drank? knew required Servers Masked, diners??? still confused! Yes, that's saying.

The virus care let people in, get around using people/goods can't stopped. get that. do. Self preservation thing. I'm saying people need bite bullet will? living elsewhere virus managed successfully? Incredibly low co-pays pretty decent coverage nationwide tangible benefits mean looking images link below, ""protests"" didnt help, still blame business owners trying keep business alive Look infection numbers southern USA. give two weeks kind thing happening here. Never getting exposed bugs viruses exactly good thing either. Wait...now it? Wtf wrong America!? Well, provide us sources said studies. I'm sure trouble finding studies?  Dutch CDC: 98% infections go without barely symptoms. 1.5% needs hospital care. 0.5 needs ICU care. 

Long term health issues extreme case. going buy peloton stock late February, never bought stock chickened out.

Fuck, would tripled money. LMFAO. genuinely made laugh loud, that’s hilarious! Sarcasm? Apologies offended. [this link might tell little A/C Hope morons second guess science notice fucking trend mean, country allows people cultist nations Middle East, course they'll allow Americans too. Wonder people going take this. like people try convince feel bad ""starving"" homeless people. cares?

Nobody tell feel, large segment population feel social responsibility--especially one wealthy USA-- ensure nobody goes hungry. lot people way see hungry dog cat. Empathy others. asked cares, answer many tens millions care hope get banned. Comedy short supply last months, substitute deficiency stupid comments.

Thank you! Wait I'm confused thought outdoor gatherings (like BLM protest marches) OK long people wore masks. What's going on?? shut bars tubing, pools can't 10 people. Mass gatherings limited max 50. covered bases except restaurants. Pushed August 17 Impressive Japan never shut anything getting virus control. citizens saw societal norm wear mask. speak anecdotally watching documentary Detroit Public Schools once. interviewed graduate functionally illiterate - system graduated turned 18, despite fact could barely read write. Luckily, young man decided go get tutoring older are, less likely make lost time schooling. America easily collectively stupid country world. think problem clue would $6000 plus dollars pocket $199. That’s simply absurd criminal price gouging. 

Hospitals duty fair pricing providing information advance. sure man, definitely sarcasm either take half percent bc easy cheap. wear mine, reminds touch face take using elastics, front. statements people make people wear properly, blah, blah, blah--so wear masks general ridiculous. one would say general use condoms, example. Drives nuts. ......Yellowstone? America wanting close restaurants bars. Several countries shut restaurants bars months, dine-in 'open space' all, takeout precautions. here? virus even hot, worth it. fucked particle day underwhelming bed. I'm really sorry, man alone -- happened well. moving New Zealand getting school working toward year. Borders closed three days flight out. Resigned position work basically sold everything owned paid school front. I've sleeping vacant house sell due virus attempt save rent money health insurance anything goes south. internet TV except go friend's house. Everything fits suitcase least, makes moving around easier. Getting kicked two weeks I'll find next place go soon. 

It's absolutely fucking gutting stuck here. Murphy really stepped whole pandemic. Especially considering tail end recovering surgery really took off. live NJ hear sides political spectrum they’re proud handled everything far. You’ll get occasional “hurr durr you’re trying dictator stop infringing non rights” wingnuts it’s much farther here. Hoping sticks guns see thing closure. asked people aaid younger people catching better treatment Hospitals. Imo one dying like hospitals overwhelemed cares people testing positive. there's little correlation even US alone number cases number deaths 3-4 weeks later. deaths 75% peak, positive tests never dropped 30% peak. people going rethinking when, even month, deaths US surpass 1000/day KN95/N95 masks protect others, cheap surgical masks etsy DIY masks, don't, protect others you. vast VAST majority people wearing latter, I'd bet influencer bad version big. Alex Jones credible man science. /s help Arizona? late? 

 
Anyone know? cities passed mandatory mask usage public spaces. Birmingham, know Mobile voting tomorrow since mayor *finally* common sense, pushing proposal super hard. 

And like, ive noticed lot mask usage little slice city (like think we’ve 207 confirmed cases zipcode entire time) several areas crazy sauce exploding getting ridiculous. work grocery store. think bad restaurants? Grocery stores shady fuckkkk cases. Masks work like urine test....

 noticed included civilian protesters political rallys political “leaders.” Nope. Wrong sex someone nothing intimate Jujitsu,

There also fusion. ready share one mind one body genocidal best friend? /s Wait you’re 18 went bar what? Drank soda? Avoiding gyms altogether lived Miami whole life moved Northern California, trust confused shit well nearly one AC.  


You gotta use crazy window things. Yeah exactly, see idea even remotely possible  think protests dumb. support them. leaders can't say..well this, can't. even canceled 4th July Firework show Houston  Trump stamp name big letters check people think coming him. Uh, intelligence agents already knew. didn’t, they’re incompetent. passed facts along powers w/in country. Israeli government sent mossad agents scour world bring back PPEs, governments doing? South Korea, Singapore Taiwan didn’t wait WHO’s directives. prepped look happened. Seriously hold national government accountable. Playing blame game doesn’t get anywhere. believe doing? Good them... don’t see old fat people crowd. They’ll get case flu worst.

Redditors BTFO healthy immune systems know, could done both:

""Effective immediately:
1. medical-grade N95 masks must reserved purchase licensed personnel medical IDs, *and* 
2. everybody public wear mask, bandanna covering nose mouth"" sure could stressed already been. 

At point realize 3 simple things (along testing, tracing, targeted quarantine) solution lieu vaccine, legitimately mentally retarded.

It's repeat full blast 3 months nationwide nonstop.

The people take seriously already beyond convincing think hoax and/or government trampling ""freedoms"". 

The people refusing comply people despise Newsom kind liberal anti-Christ. telling wear masks would probably effective point apparently resorting reverse psychology way deal pseudo-adults. figure 2100 handle thing. movie dolt. Interesting point. According CBS News, **half** Americans would get vaccine. here, always stressful crowded. They’ve really stepped curbside delivery game others take notes. Congrats upgrade! pretty sweet deal. Right stepping walmart again, they’ve made easy don’t want to. least better leadership time being. school year end? Late April? US deserve lead anymore. That's people feel like that. 

I think massive genocide slavery started country always disqualified it, generally everyone realizes US isnt world leader. actually Tampa Bay? saw map actual bay/water called Tampa Bay city called Tampa. Hey buddy, bother trying. people never actually owned house absolutely clue much time, effort money goes keeping place falling apart. type people banks LOVE save 5k... put minimum 130k house... end foreclosed three years afford fix roof / hvac / septic / taxes / etc..and file bankruptcy. Remember White House said testing would free? I've made case multiple times basically told protests exception ""according data, protests cause cases"". Like shit, that's case, isnt amazing set data use guide efforts kinds gathering harmful? kind magic occurring gatherings ones cause spread? Nope. real answer I'm wrong stupid.


It fairly baffling first. I'm surprised ever surprised. else expect? works all. getting tested Wednesday.  People Quebec complaining face coverings years. r/nottheonion Yeah, go stupid coronaphobe. worry guys pandemic over, nothing see here. That's 100 person Yes. Actually taking planning still can't retire now. takeaway influencer stayed home. really hoping governor used term knuckleheads. Oh yeah? country Quarantine since March looking great. Good luck USA, fucked ass. Yes case wear masks 24/7 cut things like flu colds actually comparable fatality rates coronavirus.

The reasoning heard people logic behind since thing fatality rate actually true leave people 60 years age. Sigh. great! far businesses go, moment, business owners risk permanent shutdown temporary lockdown. business owners lose business lost sales comply lockdown? nothing lose, lockdowns continue.

Yes, places much better job US containing initial wave coronavirus. said, virus gone. countries reopen, likely experience resurgences. believe resurgence small, think that? still community spread many places? Won’t worsen travel resumes?

If happens, Europe, Canada, others close again? people receive type government support initial lockdown, especially tax revenues decline coronavirus recession? 

Now think things mitigate spread virus prevent health care systems overwhelmed. Wearing masks huge piece that. think need realistic: job stop virus. can’t without vaccine herd immunity. long-term lockdown sustainable. Long-term disruption tourism hospitality sector sustainable. Increased deaths would come spike id imagine. Spike cases now, spike deaths later cases progress 1. Fire Trump

2.

3.  Yes exactly, clear. US CDC ""number"" flu cases every year. problem third actual positive flu tests. rest (2/3 total number) test negative flu, ILIs. lump flu total. dishonest, lazy misleading. 

To complicate things further, know test postive flu covid time. But, beginning testing US, among obstacles put place, CDC guidelines made person tested positive flu, could get tested covid .  mutually exclusive. Come innocent this. several opportunities help slow spread chose to. messaging confusing wonder people unfortunately think virus serious.  Thank you! Wish would take hoods don’t use Facebook nice try People intentionally wear masks restrict oxygen flow. makes super fit workout super efficient, like training altitude.  young people think it’s ok get virus recover it? might premature confirm long term health implications, reports **some recovered COVID-29 patients 20-30% reduced lung capacity experience problems gasping air walking quickly.**

This East Asia, easily get everyone wear mask... US, Fauci tells people potential long term adverse effects, get everyone wear mask Thanks! Ok lol. initial response aggressive. words reddit post caused depression would consider therapy looks like mental health really changes pre vs post conversations u. 

So thanks concern think handle reading words telling believe species adapt take advantage environment? Darwin literally witnessed effect work wrote whole book it... finches? Specialization?

I looking science discussion guess that's welcome here?

BTW changed title ""The Coronavirus Much Worse Think"" sounded sensationalist generally bad title. give regional context still really low, death per million Argentina 28, hand Ecuador 255, Colombia 62, Mexico 207, Chile 292, Peru 288, Brazil 275. get international news interested.  really; UV enemas, bleach injections, 100's thousands dead glaringly obvious everyone. read article NJ.com, writer little hysterical IMHO, went Bar A. environment seemed like taking seriously, think could predicted Djai's shit show. sure let parents know I've failed them. Maybe people listen, then? Curious - old child asymptomatic? 

Wishing continued health.  Well he's going take loans residency live, interest 3,000 month. Hed lucky pull 5k month taxes. gotta math, say pays minimum loans 3 years residency. make easy lets say he's thirty makes $250k year, 125k taxes. Let's say pay 60k year make simple interest 150k total 600k. loan paid 40, makes 300k year net worth around 100k. 150k-200k year taxes 22 years bring $4 million average age retirement. 

Thats bad salaries generous regular medical degree. guys much worse Florida Texas. get press population little 7 million compared Florida 21 million Texas around 29 million. Arizona puts 3500 positives like Florida 10500 Texas 14000, number smaller attract much attention. Anecdotally, still hearing friends medicine still getting one N95 mask per week reuse. time may million reasons someone mask. matter it. 

There genuinely good reasons wear mask. difficulty breathing thin cotton layer face extra scared covid avoid infection like life depends it, meaning going public without mask. fine.

I pretty much guarantee either legitimate reason wear mask unhealthy enough need stay isolation. arent victim, stop acting like one. don’t blame walk back. you’re position power, sometimes save people themselves. many breaking rules enforce case case basis. probably create travel bubble SE asia China (since export economy mostly PRC anyway) continue quarantine arrivals 14 days.

meanwhile look brilliant herd immunity strategy paying rich dividends states like arizona texas think numbers overblown, knows. time thought 100,000 likely upper limit. one living time Babylon Rome expected fall. it’s reality nation possibly fall can’t shit together deal coronavirus. Tough times ahead doubt it. ready worst. Bullshit. Straight lies. telling imposed real, coordinated, hard lockdown along mask use everyone, contained? Something every single country done successfully they've tried? lies cdc. locked nationally fined people $10k breaking lockdown wearing mask see cases plummet. No, there's will. That's completely different lie. going use weekend's activity justification lockdown coming. Please tell people around follow directions time.  Please stop getting news Facebook. You’ll happier also better-informed. much cost testing Remdesivir COVID-19 specifically? much cost gain FDA approval US? Sure.
.... ridiculous. company (not healthcare essential services) able buy thousands kn95s. hospital can't either cheap incompetent Hey looka  people act like everything normal month ago aren’t patrolling sub. They’re gonna idiots regardless. don’t know people need constant reminders take pandemic seriously

Also I’m pedantic it’s possible vaccine around October, according Oxford (in addition, Fauci said vaccine looking good end year)

The people sub, generally, taking virus seriously. posts shaming people don’t, understand gets stale since we’re heading month 4 I'd say thing worse probably concerts indoor sporting events. things gone lonnnnng time feel. I’m expecting to. read probability vaccine coronavirus, less feel effective one actually happen. He's trying stay relevant.  Yeah report system failed areas, supposedly Scary, i'm Canadian province shut things hard. sucked, toilet paper flour anywhere couple weeks. today we're 19 days without positive case. you, everyone. want self isolate wear mask cause tough guy, wear one grandma aunt capable fighting infection. Stop bunch twats. Beggars can't choosers. Or, fleeing Americans can't choosers! Take care all. someone sees differently There’s LOT reason believe stole election anyways. don’t personally know anyone voted everyone seems hate him. always absolutely think nothing beat putting thousands sick patients nursing homes. can't possibly think deadly scenario. cute. Brings wholesome joy dumpster fire situation. tell Wisconsin governor could become next Lombardi ignoring Covid No. Mass protests spike Dude die hard family members essentially disowned cause live Clay. grandmother gets sick dies cause step grandfather, I'll never forgive him. grandfather social dude hates cooped grandmother keeping check like mom teenager (even stop sneaking one morning lol)  think teens least used texting, video calling, lots learning internet. recorded lectures college, one even shows class time. Whereas think younger students need structure classroom learn best.

However, deny hurts teens too. think everyone going suffering increased depression, anxiety, loneliness result prolonged isolation loss normal social activities. graduated college year friends year don’t think there’s point going college can’t meet people campus. Half fun school friends network build. front runner vaccine candidates passed safety trials, waiting efficiency tests finish. it’s unreasonable give vaccine might 50% effective soldiers now, rather sending home isolate risk getting sick nothing stop giving rest army.

I really put anything intentionally misleading. Lots people get mild symptoms look like common colds. article posted days back construction worker cough hosted birthday party relatives infected several them. thought irritation materials working with.

If look CDC estimates could 9 10 undiagnosed.  figure 1 800 diagnosed active, 9 800 might undiagnosed active. them, portion going asymptomatic, presymptomatic, low level enough realize it. comes toy problem.

But - estimates, involves lot judgment. four families mainly isolating home, that's one thing, 20 different millenials go barhopping every night, I'd pretty worried. It’s ok. Guessing you’re healthcare worker? thank service, equally sorry burden. anything people actually help make change you? covid19 warmup something deadly comes along. we'll better prepared. shut air travel block china needs first thing do.

The poor suffering policy implemented party cnn sucks dick of. Right America nonetheless!

And children cages border guess 'network people' care suffering huh? sure didnt obama built cages

cnn cares suffering benefits bottom line.

GREED.

Fox reports truth. That's scaredd threatened them. worried scared exposing truth three months makes big difference bad situation anyway. smoked pot Johnny Hopkins need 5G chip implanted forehead track you. hate Trump much next rational person, if/when see somebody Trump mask tell awesome desperate encourage people wear damn things. care printed it. need print bunch KKK masks get people wear them, happy state society message sends, least people wearing masks.

Okay, maybe that's much. damn need people wear masks.  saw setting one Miami Dade area maybe couple months ago. sure happened it. It’s multiplayer :O US educational system set move move out. Ya people fuck hate people country. remember first Alex Jones video. Shame effective public health policy. drive people underground without correcting behavior. See: public health AIDS crisis Yes, addressed that. wasn’t alive AIDS epidemic 80s, can’t say sure, still don’t think HIV singular focus scientific community way COVID now. likely bloodborne illnesses nowhere near contagious droplet-borne viruses, entire world didn’t shut HIV.

From know, initial monotherapies (AZT) available shortly HIV became epidemic, triple therapy use today took 10 years develop. AZT effective, HIV mutates quickly becomes resistant don’t use cocktail drugs. also integrates DNA host, it’s rather different virus coronaviruses. 

I actually don’t know we’ll ever get covid-19 antiviral way HCV, one completely rids body virus. don’t antivirals coronaviruses. think what’s likely supportive treatment improves much death rate drops low percent. occurs combination vaccine, Fauci says possible end year, likely become another background virus chronically deal like influenza rhinoviruses. Technically yes read fur pretty terrible surface covid live long. whole operation unsafe, particularly workers can’t cook mask on. many sides takeout, one also happens person making food. brothers sisters industry dropping like flies due virus. welcome take look article said done - ton respect folks signing vaccine trials.

Whereas could test nursing home Florida end positives New Zealand. percent people infected constant yes testing equals positives. parse whether cases people infected really need examine percent test positive function total tests. people wear masks,

See that's problem. isn’t optimism. It’s optimism experts trained infectious diseases. Someone understand population density, current trends. already know projected vaccine, using technology never used humans developed use Chimps, going 100% safe effective without side effects across entire US population? think many aspects life return pre-covid ""normal"". Forcing? Baby, people OPTION. believe businesses open mean go visit spaces. stay inside rest life regardless businesses open you’ll safe. Everyone stay inside. opening businesses force people go them? Curious read way. forcing anyone anything, including forcing people poverty home imprisonment. Well yeah, one particular news channel overdose pack argument leave side road. Someone might pick later anti science disregard CDC says 99.6% people get Covid survive? Really? That's think us‽ vaccine enough. Distributing vaccinating significant part world population is. understand government handing free. flew NY London, NYPD standing outside LIRR station handing free. Now, come upstate drug stores selling one two dollars each... filtered paper ones see doctor's offices. virus new yet know long-term effects contracting ""mild"" case COVID. virus may damaging bodies asymptomatic other, silent ways. Among 331 passengers the[ *Diamond* *Princess* cruise tested positive symptoms, 76 people CT scans lungs nearly half showed signs lung tissue damage typical coronavirus infection. “People getting infection without symptoms actually lot damage bodies don’t know it,” 

from everybody one degree separation someone caught seriously, expect entire country take seriously pick parts car yesterday, person entire building mask. see anywhere around town anymore. clear would go way ensure protests linked even tangentially connected coronavirus.

Or could risk outdoor transmission low, mask-wearing mitigates spread, masked-up outdoor events might actually relatively safe.

Is point would say “biology” says protests didn’t cause surge? Cause it’s like month multiple places huge protests haven’t seen surges yet. Shit even excess deaths guys better uk per capita basis front-line health care worker, member high-risk category, resident nursing home, person powerful connections politicians billionaires, probably able get vaccine GP's office late summer early fall 2021, assuming vaccine begun production fall 2020, best-case scenario. ReOpen protests assume mean? 

Because they’re going a
memo dated May 10th. Yes, believe vaccine mandatory ""After news conference LGBTQ activists critical Mount Sinai Hospital’s relationship religious organization coronavirus pandemic, city’s police commissioner mayor said “protests” would tolerated.""

I'm sure point making here. lost friend march tried warn this. said millions would die especially worried home state - Arizona. told I’m virologist (I’m veterinarian, actually learn shit ton virology epidemiology), it’s cold, needed stop reading “fake news” sources. also said really mean shit blocked him.

I thought AZ would run water would biggest issue. Like, thought everyone operating water system would get sick utilities would get shut off. aware makes sense early March - country went little bananas. crazy ass buying camping supplies everyone else hoarding toilet paper. Anyway. urged make survival plan consider getting state quickly didn’t long. super strong gut feeling. may wrong reason it’s blowing mind accurately predicted state would get hit worst early game. unblocked haven’t reached back yet - waiting number deaths hit one million did. initially blocked him, planned send told message. way I’m sending now, virus making eat crow. It’s forcibly shoving crow throat fistful. I’m petty dramatic much, yikes.

Ftr know didn’t predict shit it’s coincidence. It’s really, really specific crazy one. percentage anti-vaxxers qualify label. discriminating. What's vaccine? benefits vs risks? necessary nearly accept it? long vetted? changing strain business? (almost every year flu vaccine seems miss mark, injected still get sick happened last winter). vaccines farm animals subject meat eaters terms new human vaccine? loading bodies vaccine materials effects? etc can't take advantage viral load. can't anything change it. many copies virus exist inside you. Oxford vaccine developed scratch, point. 

And know, trust Oxford tell whether vaccine safe lot trust tell it’s safe, random internet stranger. bunch people trying make one covid promising. Depends. certainly need pretty strict major cities. statewide orders trickier large states many rural areas. better surgical county based approach. bunch people trying make one covid promising. No, writer article sound like idea talking about. Obviously people use phrase, speaking limit free speech hypothetical case someone causing pandemonium densely crowded public space.

No one referencing case phrase coined.

And, guess what, hypothetically shouted ""school shooter!"" crowded auditorium, possibly sound effects boot, people got crushed killed mob panic exits, ***you would held liable.*** would, surprise, fall first amendment. Well doesn’t sound good 6k deaths far* lets see numbers 2 months YET HOSPITAL GOVERNMENT TRIES MAKE WRITTEN GUIDELINES MAKE CHOICES BURDEN GUILT DECISION LEFT ENTIRELY SHOULDERS INDIVIDUAL HEALTHCARE WORKER, PEOPLE FREAK FUCK OUT.

Sorry, guys, I've little frustrated.

It's amazing many people believe ""When enough ventilators, we're going stop giving people eighty"" worse policy ""let individual doctor choose gets individual ventilator go home shoot themselves."" Money speaks louder, lobbyists things like American Cattleman's Association *lot* money power. economy lives... entirely incorrect. H1N1 rapidly decreasing mid-Fall 2009 ie burnt out. man goes away.

The 1918 Spanish Flu killed 50 million faded away. Why? enough people level immunity.

We reach appreciable levels immunity flu strains time.  wait fucking January potentially new competent leadership... Also, vaccine likely available spring.

How know that? News encouraging guarantee. isn't. toned details down. know believe, want full terror it, send chat request I'll tell full account.

People can't figure look chart March April see peaks were, figure next increase begin could go echo chamber subreddit harvest karma wanted.

Whats point? Outdoors Decatur (in shopping/public areas) don’t see much masking. Indoors pretty solid though. Serious question: best type mask actually provides protection, actually fits buy online? 

## Significance

Pigs intermediate hosts generation pandemic influenza virus. Thus, systematic surveillance influenza viruses pigs key measure prewarning emergence next pandemic influenza. Here, identified reassortant EA H1N1 virus possessing pdm/09 TR-derived internal genes, termed G4 genotype, become predominant swine populations since 2016. Similar pdm/09 virus, G4 viruses essential hallmarks candidate pandemic virus. concern swine workers show elevated seroprevalence G4 virus. Controlling prevailing G4 EA H1N1 viruses pigs close monitoring human populations, especially workers swine industry, urgently implemented.

## Abstract

Pigs considered important hosts “mixing vessels” generation pandemic influenza viruses. Systematic surveillance influenza viruses pigs essential early warning preparedness next potential pandemic. Here, report influenza virus surveillance pigs 2011 2018 China, identify recently emerged genotype 4 (G4) reassortant Eurasian avian-like (EA) H1N1 virus, bears 2009 pandemic (pdm/09) triple-reassortant (TR)-derived internal genes predominant swine populations since 2016. Similar pdm/09 virus, G4 viruses bind human-type receptors, produce much higher progeny virus human airway epithelial cells, show efficient infectivity aerosol transmission ferrets. Moreover, low antigenic cross-reactivity human influenza vaccine strains G4 reassortant EA H1N1 virus indicates preexisting population immunity provide protection G4 viruses. serological surveillance among occupational exposure population showed 10.4% (35/338) swine workers positive G4 EA H1N1 virus, especially participants 18 35 old, 20.5% (9/44) seropositive rates, indicating predominant G4 EA H1N1 virus acquired increased human infectivity. infectivity greatly enhances opportunity virus adaptation humans raises concerns possible generation pandemic viruses.

* [**swine [**Eurasian avian-like H1N1 [**2009 pandemic H1N1 [**pandemic fox remember Machado lake overhauled. giant fence around whole thing. Need beaches. Wait, that? thought government people invincible getting sued US hit 100k/day mark (or really stay at), CDC right true number 10-20X higher, reach herd immunity vaccine developed? math, we'd 60% infection rate within 3 months pace going. 

I absolutely want happen - know lot people die - feels like we're heading. No, that's still asymptomatic. symptom basically anything patient feels/notices. 

Lung damage **sign** possible COVID infection sure. coughing short breath, symptoms. felt totally normal, symptoms. lungs displayed signs. agree issue. However, would like add know people live US, good education, still believe bunch conspiracy theories (and refuse wear masks). Obviously willful destruction education system US helping, tendency think terms goes beyond broken schooling geographical bias US. interesting. Unfortunately Santa Rosa county hospitals. go Okaloosa Escambia counties need medical care. much better though. lol people wear masks, see gatherings beaches worse gatherings protests. sadly seems world loves resorting insults hatred don’t agree another’s opinion based actual experience rather media sensationalization. still BLM movement, Pride, etc... people like still exist. I’m sorry happened you. 

What snowflake were, physically accosting someone much smaller them. Maybe turn football fields memorials. might metric people understand Don’t forget C) American electoral freedom smoke mirror show there’s bottomless well voter suppression draw minute face real challenge power Holy shit. sounds terrifying. I’m glad feeling better now! I’ve seeing lot info don’t keep antibodies long (1-3 months) make sure keep safe! proves earlier number cases undercounted. rise caused testing. It’s significantly younger people getting tested now. groups people significantly less likely hospitalized die. clearly stated protesters risking spreading virus. point was, reason gather important, worth taking risk.

LMAO it? Really worth risking lives thousands innocent people protest? Protests done *right now* middle pandemic?

No, worth killing innocent men, women, children giving lifelong debilitating conditions. rights end begin endanger lives others fucking Corona bad look numbers. 

So people gathering beach fucking problem? okay protestors literally spread disease kill people? really can't see hypocrisy here? think gyms easy target people go unfortunately, get mental picture bunch roided-up tattooed bros instead normal healthy people make gym population. gyms closed, makes non-gym goers feel better going. People identifyed state nation Civil War. even things go south people state first almost every time. young person expect vaccinated till next winter. Every vaccine gets made go vaccinating vulnerable. take long time till vaccinate all. sense urgency waned... got bored it? shitbird motherfuckers! 

WW2 actually served purpose, there's purpose this. could bring people together expand Americans empathy one another bring communities together, nah, we'll grow divisive go bars soon reopen... smh anybody cares Sweden free... imagine paying. Lol  europe cloth masks norm nowadays, seems working. still shortage N95 masks use something else Oh well boyfriends sisters nephews cat didn’t spread cubical workers brothers sons friends Xbox Live I’m sure it’s contagious. willful ignorance best  might lose everything though. Feel empathy. put hundreds thousands bar end absolutely nothing. Imagine someone took home livelihood save lives. easy sacrifice. Many bars never open  I'm lucky county low number cases. probably insurance. Besides perception children reality influences decisions. think fine. Therefore, it. mean, great one. Bust masks far effective protecting others you, protecting others. helps protect wearer, course, significantly. Right. second part question. long hiv around millions millions research funding thrown drugs came around? 30 years?

Same hep c. That’s like 5 year old find virus known 30 years

the word “ REALISTICALLY” included reason good news progress made, need remember vaccine, cure. may already late US since vaccine really help someone already infected virus, unless dont understand vaccines work. Nah bro 5g theme must hurt Denmark. Can’t blame one Sweden. Sadly 100% true. Even federal government wanted fix sure half country would even comply point.

We lost chance. Yeah playbook written professionals would us track reopening end next year Really? don’t think bad enough? Italy peaked &lt;6,000 cases per day. Italy, entire country. Remember bad was?

Oh, Italy lot old people, doesn’t apply Arizona. ;/ Please read press release. Mice _and humans_. 94% humans. But, know, infecting volunteers purpose still bit controversial. Looks ticking along rest state. 

I like website, btw. Thanks. masks ruin facial recognition software. right. dont think idiots mentioned article type people listens official recomendations anyway. speculation right now. Projection somewhat contained, spikes dont think people going lockdown Obama killed aunt Dijon mustard. Vaccine progress looking cautiously optimistic Huntington Beach packed then. doubt Orange County close problem looking over, talking ""how many people died"" past tense thing.

The fact basically every country *is* past tense, whereas [this current state resounding ""the US terrible"" verdict.

The US apparently ramping worst part peak, 3 months in, peak everyone else already came from. shockingly anomalous amongst comparisons. Karma going hit hard you’re going prepared it. Maybe supposed sarcastic?

But assuming 60% needed herd immunity still looking somewhere around 5 years 100,000 cases day. Assuming US population 330 million. 

That’s long time. AIDS DNA virus, COVID-19 RNA virus, can’t really compare vax creation times Thats true. Im including lackluster response mayors across country though. failure leadership isnt Trump, odious may government provide basic necessities, forcing people risk lives money?

The self centeredness forcing people risk lives pandemic survival absolutely evil. I'd like see schools flexible. keep kids home, though they'd miss lot educationally socially; they're safe well-fed. kids' safe school I'd like able go back, even staggered part-time. worry health safety educators, parents, children whether able go back not. makes feel better, never better prepared weather storm. Stay strong. 💯 Keep bars open. Institute 5 pm curfew. source 10% hospitalization rate bc according CDC 98 need hospitalization per 100,000 population, cases, Well anyone really die Titanic? did.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Texas would hiding 40,000 deaths equal NYs numbers It’s going Cat 4-5 hurricane. Carolinas, Georgia, Bama, Louisiana, etc already struggling containing COVID. Add panic shopping water, driving away storm staying motels, bringing virus landlocked relatives.. spread mask ON, spread mask spreading droplets, even talking, though yell, cough, sneeze. We're protecting wear mask, want us. Hell.. Trump made MAGA facemasks, supporters bitching.

Not become political, does: arguing one side, providing factual info. think strict lockdown brought cases extremely low level. done that, would position NY testing 1% positive. forgotten well developing tests virus. I'd probably trust Chinese made vaccine one pushed US administration. 

At least, would ""not US"" countries vouched it. state governors still taking seriously. least northeast. homofobes.. surprised speaking several swedish colleagues. hope never ever open China ever again. scary would US starts seeing ping-pong effects across region? cousin concerned NY 100 days ago. Now, virus basically entrenched everywhere country. feel like I'm seeing bigger ""second wave"" setting slowly. completely see angle still think comes let everyone risk want to. banned sex high risk STIs? No, course not. chose safe way abstain. forced avoid sun skin cancer real? course not, wear sunblock. things open doesn’t mean go outside visit open business. anyone would like continue living life recluse go outside, please continue so! stay safe risk it. everyone CHOICE.

I also think it’s fucked much effort infection 98% survival rate society don’t care world hunger actually kills millions every year. COVID end all. far pressing humanitarian matters one gives shit isn’t TV. Exactly. approaching slipshod case-by-case. One example Allegheny County Pennsylvania, contains Pittsburgh. they've alarmed increase positive cases, they've decided roll back letting bars open letting restaurants serve alcohol site. that's County. people want go bars want sit restaurants drink going drive rural areas bring virus goes. demanding people risk lives money instead demanding government stop taking taxes handing businesses demanding risk lives profit?

Why support people need instead forcing risk lives? ....I one workers. coming someone 20 years industry. don’t trust operations taking chances many us working sick. Ok, wasn’t going dignify discussion getting involved, don’t even get discussion, hot temperature people. Kevin deserves lose said, so, yes, she’s hot, she’s hot heck, she’s female Boris Becker.

The name made flash episode head. Gotta respect. xD might primed economy support re-election. pretty strong Covid. 

Now, next 2 months exponential growth pretty much locked in. doesn’t shut economy today, regular folks start shutting death rate starts get insane 6 weeks. 

Trump could economic case re-election he’d obliterated Covid back March-May. Yeah, I'm hooked right local diner's breakfast hash browns, scrambled eggs toast. seem fairly safe they're heated cooked part wonders well handled comes grill. Nice see folks NBC shitposting facts You’d think government would see understand needs done Hmmm. rude guy internet vs 

Your argument may credibility obnoxious perhaps cite reportable source two. 

The idea reduce risk. 

In non clinical environment non medical mask effective reducing spread virus clinical environment, I'll assume tone not, protocols follow dictated whatever infectious disease agency follow. Remdesivir going used hundreds millions people. delivered IV, pretty much used patients hospitalized. pandemic shown condom use effective should. People thing correctly. bet people refuse wear masks idea national debt is. 

I'd bet people know national ""debt"" is, mask mask. erroneously equate household debt, assume bonds issued borrowing operation, like friend above, assume income tax revenues pay spending. Fastest ever approved, made. mandates like exist? think gaps account much flow surgical mask think. inhalation immediately collapses mask around mouth creating low pressure seal. believe me, take surgical mask sized piece plastic non-porous material put loosely mouth try breath -- get almost air. air passing loose fit mask primarily passing pores. actually exhalation cause balloon outwards expel air edges. trust Fauci. I’ll take vaccine get one it’s ready . I’m afraid it. infer lot lifestyle comments. seem like new age “muh freedoms” type. 

I don’t think you’re going get vaccine matter say (and clear genuinely doubt claim you’re anti-vaxxer based comments) goal convince people reading shouldn’t listen you.  Look curves Iran. They've performed similar US. Expect 1 month delay second spike deaths cases. Yes, big pharmas usually sell one drug. Nice analysis, dude. That's follow instructions. Factory farming pretty much universal practice, China, industry allows spread viruses like well viruses extremely efficient

This happens US well Aight, cool

RemindMe! two months would glad show tons photos masked protesters, like.

no, keep anecdotal evidence. literally hundreds photos unmasked protestors, evidence “people contracted 4 weeks ago spreading people?”

Well, spikes happening virus known contagious 5 days infection.

Yes infected people “media talking points.” science logic. 

then show *scientific* studies. Sounds good right? way virus spreading right now?.. Quarantine everyone :/ Plenty body weight workouts available, like one Schwarzenegger shared one used access weights, full set resistance bands going 150 lbs 40 bucks amazon.

I willing bet workout good enough one best bodybuilders time, good enough keep people healthy quarantine. Snitching bad, banning also bad. difficult times. Cuomo's idiot many reasons. decision left individual, see he's coming from. get want blame Tegnell FHM everything

I really don't. I'm trying show he/they're saying could influence people's behaviors, beliefs perceptions. kinda job situation, right? look person replied comment. Texas ICU normal capacity extended surge capacity slowing sight. act proactively prevent kind stuff, going hear hospitals totally *out* capacity far late people legitimately dying streets, right projections hope avoid that.  Half roommates going 4th july gathering Saturday 

I planned mini bbq us..guess said deaths would down? Southern Ontario here. overdue one shutdown.    
Last week barbers opened able to.   
I sat car watched businesss ran. impressed system went ahead.  
The system.. register door, wait outside called, masks worn required all...half work stations shut down. crowds line 10-15 minutes.     
BUT ... cost $5 before.    
Still, drive around, able get haircut barbershop always first choice. (Yes..a pun.) Jump Shark BK got surgical type masks online maybe get n95's too. I'll check around. Sorta misleading title never made claim numbers going hit said surprised hit 100k day take action states driving resurgence already granted need more. awfully self entitled someone depends altruism. Who's say yet diagnosis high risk disease? know someone died yet mean never will. 

Yes, country needs &amp; reopen. Yes, able &amp; lot places able go &amp; socialize again. 

All ask wear mask store less chance infected. honestly understand can't handle that. 15 minutes half hour life little uncomfortable much bear? herd growing stronger.
But really, wrong Sweden?????? chuckled. 10/10 response! ""The biggest problem universe nobody helps other."" 

Even simple WEAR FUCKING MASK. looking window see people playing street basketball. course masks 8 them. 

My neighbor giant party shooting fireworks. 

I knew state fucked even seemed like going be. many LIVE outside great. Sure expensive AF winter thing Southern California. forced inside bit restless. 

It feels like I'm elementary school again. matter behave, everyone else jackass ruining everything. Next thing know write apology letters people. ""Sorry state fucked WEARING MASKS KEEPING AWAY OTHER."" 

What sucks state good areas. Really pushes protections marginalized people, high standards emmisons cars, even reducing smog levels. also full FUCKING SELFISH JACKASSES cannot STAY INSIDE. 

Millions die. many old people family expect funerals go soon. know even mourn correctly depending is. least parents put shit anymore, count among lucky.... Saying scientists sounds great scientist idea damage society locking everyone home year.

Medically that's best answer disease would likely kill millions upon millions people starved one producing food.

It needs combination medical economic experts, CDC disagreeing, Economists never agree...

So sounds great scream....just listen experts, reality simple Experts said “don’t reopen AZ.” 

Experts said “enact mandatory mask order.”

Experts said weeks ago, “lockdown AZ since reopened early.”

Experts said “our icu beds full since still haven’t shut requires masks. Please one least.” 

And bare minimum. That’s certainly swift decisive leadership. actually know lifestyle.

I understand rabid urge lecture everyone deem moronic. Reddit way.

But maybe that's productive goal virus prevention.

Because making incorrect judgments going convince I'm wrong. I’m lonely time. friends one talk to. Oh know, think God would've come long time ago existed gave fuck may never able travel Europe smh certainly kinda grateful recovering alcoholic right now. used spend time money bars booze. stepped foot bar like 4 years worry getting infected. 

That shit also wrecked health immune system drinking lot. hope covid19 crap goes away Either figure way move test online, issue temporary license lasts year make take test year. large part population drinks social. arent home. Also potentially meet new people. Now, support bars open all, drinking home thing many many people. Claiming unbiased making clearly opinionated discriminationory claims Americans like ""banjo playing idiots"". mentioned Michigan, doubled southern stereotype? Seems like even listening, narrative running it. I've also never seen educated person actually claim they're ""highly educated white male"", skin color gives higher opinion here. either uneducated, clearly deep rooted racist beliefs, bot. Ah maybe that's it. virus definitely awful. Let go edit. Thanks. NOW??  anyone else gtting sick headlines response be, ""NOW??? before... comments elsewhere stated working photographer posting pictures gatherings. no, hyper vigilant. imagine problem would come enforcement, usual. 100cc suppository daily. Also cures autism win win. I. Yeah we've saying We've even elected actors, actually bad politicians. Probably another role them. escaping meeting god done genetic sleuthing think started international quarantine hotels problems with. begin inquiry. Mortgage rates low right now, perhaps refinancing could make things affordable? Medical staff wears can't distance. surgical masks work distanced properly. Crazy Eric would think rant articulate. gotta get tempatured? may aware Trump pondered Quarantining NY, Cuomo claimed declaration war Regardless STOP TRAVELING UNLESS ESSENTIAL People can’t seem grasp fucking pandemic, summer vacation plans may large ones normally occur. 

Edit: grammar Might help cause news carried instead mayor telling someone keep name mouth. That's really helping /s Read article 50% 75 max whichever less. They’re coming conclusion, late June? expertise Finance since March saying mask mandate would reduce economic impact virus I'm marketing PR sware every time one dumb tweets goes out, cringe. think idea winner sure. know PR team afraid speak him, stubborn care. Either way, nightmare. Shame Rhode Island refusing service customers aren’t wearing masks. Flint, Michigan, place far two cases, disputes involving security guards. thought ""Bill Gates Mark Beast"" bullshit died weeks ago, still seeing passed around even though easiest myth debunk regarding Covid. Laura Kelly getting much backlash trying keep people alive. I'm pretty proud KS handled pandemic part (we 14,000 cases least 1/4 came outbreaks two meat packing plants). yeah douche bags trying overturn safety laws piss off, well regular people shitting saying overreacting. dunno people saw happened New York see what's happening Texas, Florida, California think can't happen here. Absolutely I'll tell anything want know. voting funny. wonder low actually get.
The virus wife came waves. started mid March, tingling throat ears nose. wife's hands went numb sensation wise. still worked normally, weaker. tingling went away two weeks come back symptoms would rotate, coming twenty minute waves duration. Redness skin, covid hands feet, swelling, vasculitis, etc. post viral inflammation part lasted even till symptoms come waves, inflammation. like he's calling ""anti-science"".

The US needs reckoning revamping education system. Facts change like them. We've always nation independents. countries social cohesiveness. note general policies towards disease reflect that. Somewhere broke disasters wars shown act together towards common goal. Luxuries like....basic human contact families. protesters done spread virus family five Fourth July barbecue. anyone know see testing rate state/county? trying find can't find anything online. Greetings out-of-control South Carolina. I'll run governor, but, well, say here: Bless heart... needs federal mandate wear masks, federal supply masks population, financial impact (ticketing) wearing masks outside home.

Otherwise wearing mask good idea, everyone common sense without enforcement would seem.

This put damper businesses course,  impacts, course people fight saying infringes various ways. sounds like needs mental therapy well. Yes, billionaires wealth majority stocks. don’t pay taxes stocks sell it’s capital gains. Jeff Bazos worth hundred billion dollars doesn’t pay taxes majority ownership Amazon shares, sold yet. I've getting letters cash buyouts multiplex property large corporations.

What's gonna happen large corporations gonna buy small landlords. ultimately leads higher rents large corporations power control rent prices let units sit unrented hoping higher priced buyer.

This move screws renters landlords. Whereas stimulus checks would save everyone. Take like cloth masks. 100% effective good enough it'll keep transmission low enough society function keep life sucking much. Ik saying mandatory masks sounds ridiculousto me, common sense US all. want hear people countries help confirm deny portion citizens really stupid ones making big deal masks hear you. Try carve time yourself. son way, actually. Scary think work entail. example great example group think mentality. isn’t doctor alive would advise wearing mask manual labor warm temperatures. may thought protecting likely putting least amount danger cardiovascular event needlessly. I'd rather self isolate another 2 years wait proper vaccine.  chinese, vaccine works 95% time kills 5% people acceptable risk.  concept individual rights. apply US president? Even though proven entirely reasonable since elected? pharmaceutical company wants charge $3,000 Covid-19 treatment charging *per month* HIV treatment prevention. going California. One expensive places live US. Unemployment $4,000 month. much live Bay Area. doubt would cover people's rent + bills. landlords understand this? middle pandemic. Finding another job almost impossible right now. part full PPE kit including eye cover/face masks, scrubs, gloves trained regularly masks protect user. cases barely protect user greatly protect everyone user. *everyone* wearing masks necessary make effective. loan package this? Heck, make online test let people take home. Better waiving altogether. I’ve getting kinds takeout, turned pretty good. Chinese Indian stand really well travel, sushi standout me. There’s also place near serves ramen week, they’ve refining packing method. Helps also takeout cocktails state, might little forgiving necessary. Splurge seasoning butter one two meals week. Honestly, realize exactly much salt butter restaurant chefs actually use, it’s little concerning, damn taste good. you’re going bars right now, margarita risking bartender’s life, everyone else community well. Landlords cops, two despised classes people society, also happen two groups showing asses crisis? Wonder ""I let government dictate do...""

You wear seatbelt? follow speed limit? sure symptoms didn’t match? still many sicknesses cause symptoms.

I heard Red Cross offering free antibody tests blood donation, might worth checking out. Sad gotta test airports simple us sick campaign manager tweet implied Trump masks “coming visiting parents entire time, said comment house. 

You’re one who’s afraid. brain chooses ignore reality 130,000 dead Americans rising. reality much you.

Also—we wear mask go out. It’s simple easy. It’s big deal. ❤️ theory- Americans give damn million die population uneducated blinded various religious political biases, pandemic hit literal basis. Anyone math minimum number cases every American know someone died it? probably graduate students research summer. university testing everyone allowed begin research again. Yeah SonoraQuest report time yesterdays reported numbers fucked up. go today's numbers, 19% positive rate 23,471 tests much better sample size line upward creeping weekly % positive average False premise: either/or situation. stated demands medical shelter place order enforce  bars nightclubs  restaurants take-out require transparancy regarding employees testing Nothing science absolute, take home is, small number kids young adults getting life threatening syndrome recover COVID. affected syndrome asymptomatic COVID. 

The syndrome affect lot different organs parts body, may result hospitalization death. know man can’t happen overnight, trust say caring worrying others think liberate time. struggle similar problems like you, pm want advice specific situation Yes it’s worrisome wouldn’t quite compare NY.

41% positivity rate 1,500 tests one thing, New York 45% positivity 20k tests!!   okay, I've got bleach. anyone remember dosage I'm supposed take? 🤦🏻‍♀️ Testing down, even Birx's presentation briefing last week. slide breezed 5 seconds. sure people screaming this..  , know why? Cause really , truly, give fuck. happened , moved on. life fine right now, shit happens , die eventually. Hopefully death dope trip. mad killed thousands ordering nursing homes take Covid patients? Well little bit dickish. live eat lot. shopping 10 people. assume say ""stock up"" shopping months worth food. $80 worth groceries going deprive someone eating. air still recirculated definitely infect many people restaurant.

So essentially, mask rules indoor eating pointless.

Obviously answer ""let's object wearing masks entirely"", answer ""don't open sit-down service ya numptys"". dystopia? original  WTF?

I've downloaded latest data FHM spreadsheet lists 7,650 cases week ending June 28... European CDC 9,094.

How could two numbers different?

Is Sweden reporting different numbers official channels reports public via website? everyone saying increase cases won’t cause increase deaths, Arizona data unfortunately says otherwise. remember big den-swe rumble Portugal, 22 June 2004? 


And cannot love Brian (and mr Perekles),  really kind is, lot ways. different experience Facebook Twitter. even read comments, much less participate. generally get *far* less disinformation (which probably comes lot curating feed blocking people subs regular). impossible underestimate. There's version gay guy holding laptop video playing says words sync her, much enjoyable IMO. Cöusin? 40% tip paying $13 meal $20. That's wild. What’s sad knew without even looking it. Let guess, sign local bar? 😂  94% really good. Hope stays way. particular, infection load (the amount virus take moment infection) matter terms severity?

There's way doesn't. literally every disease existence. seem react pandemic. Success requires us proactive. state started reopening actually someone know say ""is pandemic really still thing"" proceeded go bar weekend. bars closed services scaling back. TP buying also completely idiotic well. Guess get enough rolls wipe butts first time. stressed much strong correlational data was.

she stress wants, best get ""it's cheap, worth shot"". Strong correlation still correlation. 

And Rogan know better quack around like that's definitely going help COVID... mocking people (then backtracking) wearing masks. 

We wish get sun pop vitamin good... sadly, evidence that. sick note? middle school. job requires doctor's note sick day bullshit Here, lingered forever, naturally people get fed up, eventually things.

This central leadership, states come varying policies. also states spiking rapidly others not. ones spiking rapidly also ones following/enforcing mask guidelines. Denmark size single state, compared level states typically either organized pandemic response, Everyone acts like murdering grandmothers don’t wear one. quite far-fetched.

You murdering someone asymptomatic carrier obtusely wearing mask public spaces people densely packed (shopping areas, lines, yes even out-doors degree).

Again, virus spreads via aerosols. already proven primary method spreading. surface spreading still indefinitive...but mean stop washing hands.  Masks public safety precaution rooted solid science (as well pragmatic logic). 

What primarily arguing here, masks unnecessary Denmark prioritize initially, flawed ultimately dangerous anyone manage convince.

Again, stop that. irresponsible you. ""anti polution"" masks N95 equivilants though point probably easier buy respirator facemask. I've seen P100s hardware stores recently.

I feel like buying ""normal"" N95 still great idea hospitals still issues getting though. personally attacking want believe everything told.

The Kaiser works right across Children’s hospital I’m pretty sure there’s bunch hospitals area. point works MAJOR Kaiser hospital said don’t nearly close much much beginning outbreak. apparently Los Angeles highest country. reckon going end west much faster. Unless begin taking incoming travelers states hotel keeping guard, measures particularly effective.

What even someone arrives Florida plane says sure they'll staying - forget place quarantine safely? another patient, one therapists. Yup. real tired hearing bullshit.

Yes, hot. live South. we've got tons pretty breathable masks still good enough social distancing like supposed be, telling mask ""too hot"" got 2 feet hair gallon hairspray it. mask nothing compared centerpiece carrying around head. Get fuck it, guys.

It amazes crybabies people this. seriously need PRINTED FACE MASKS. can't politicize something that's already politicized. ""Virtue signalling."" 
So ignorant racist? Got it. sense would left out. Police control country scaring everyone shitless unchecked power immunity held accountable brought justice crimes people meant protect serve. It’s sad love going movies it’s worth covid risk. Plus even vaccinations rolled movie theaters won’t anything show awhile movie production impacted virus too. Shove arse fat boy assuming something significantly better ready production couple months later. Start country developed universal health care system widespread trust science. moderate improvement high vaccination rate would greatly tamp outbreaks. allows normally functioning society something better comes out. economic reasons alone, many countries need put pressure wound now. governor closed businesses mandatory mask order. won’t enact mask order point. Fuck Man. closes businesses enact mask order? hubris, nepotism lack discipline. people raised false notion inherent greatness minimizing work ethic personal responsibility. NY &lt;/3 U Clarifying: tip 38.5% ($5 $13 tab) one iota (other applicable taxes)? think murder hornets lasted day, live Orlando idea “Sahara dust cloud” thing.


But sure, logical next step would zombies... Oh fuck me. never going end way people currently treating pandemic. "" **Inflated late data** ""

That's lame excuse, shows testing nearly enough. science degree breathe nose

I also don’t mind looking people don’t know. Basic human decency that

Personal freedom? Really? You’re snowflake think wearing mask impinges constitutional right? Fucking pathetic 6*

There fixed  think allergies acting up. Runny nose, light cough flem throat along feeling tired time. temp rising hit 99.2 yesterday usually run mid 97's. extremely sick right Zyrtec claratin really helping anymore. 

I live alone really run many people either lol. mean sheep mentality save lives putting something face. Ah, probably ever get way thinking. ╮(╯_╰)╭ need stop line.

By saying this, saying ""you putting danger wearing mask"". 

That's many people wearing them.. understand wearing masks protect people around (not confused understand choose evil).

So true. Masks going work well, can't figure society. country like ever going recover? happening person restaurants.It's happening online retail well. USPS country delays written websites customers insult employees via emails, call screaming get packages right away, what's going on?! Umm...a pandemic,sir. heard? disgusting behavior cultivated nation. Stay school, kids. someone whose clean customer's wall-shit, 100%. Exactly.. kind family gatherings EXACTLY we're seeing huge spikes SoCal. Memorial day, grad parties, Father's Day, name it, every block family 2 love friends &amp; extended relatives over. rate spread rising rapidly multiple states safe size gathering. takes one asymptomatic cousin nephew literally kill 3 4 elders hospitalize half group. point criminal negligence? He’s piece shit  fuck even you? think like that? China's obsession eating weird exotic animals gets us mess. fuck we? [The US really recent robust history human experimentation without consent.](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41811750/ns/health-health_care/t/ugly-past-us-human-experiments-uncovered/)

And POTUS strike strong human rights advocate.

Do think Trump cares personally? sounds crazy 🤷‍♀️ Original study found here: summary english also provided:

**Large differences excess mortality March–May 2020 country birth Sweden**

The Swedish strategy dealing covid-19 criticized accounting difficulties conducting voluntary social distancing settings household overcrowding, dependence public transport large proportion service sector workers. neighbourhoods typically larger proportion immigrants. compared all-cause-mortality data Sweden country origin 2020 2016-2019 found large disparities. number deaths among persons born countries many refugees migrated Sweden last decades 220% higher March-May 2020 compared mean 2016-2019. contrast, increased mortality among persons aged 40-64 years 19% increased number deaths aged 65 years born Sweden, EU North America three months. observations illustrate need dedicated diverse strategy dealing covid-19 pandemic. think travel US, Americans. Less fewer could used depending threshold defined. Mismanaged messaging. state says one thing fed says something else people bound get confused. many selfish people makes difficult. (continued)

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* time tell I'm totally unsure point... Sweden killed people nearly every country world (to date). 10x deaths neighbors Finland Norway.

Sweden, governments admission, totally fucked up. There's also sign Sweden's economy ""isn't fucked"" neighbors. seem feeling worse impact Throw baby bath water... She’s talking God ? Chinese put warning found extremely dangerous new flu pigs ferrets, Fauci mentioned today Senate hearing. 

If gets loose starts circulating fall truly deep shit immunity one either.

Edit: link Lockdowns brought daily increases to, say, 10% peak. Relaxing lockdowns increases R0 1, let's say 1.5 (lower 2 estimated earlier pandemic we're still taking precautions). People spread disease around let's say 2 weeks (before get better go hospital).

How many weeks lifting restrictions take get back 100% peak growth rates?

In words: ridiculous expect see impact relaxed restrictions immediately. Exponential growth still takes time ramp up. Probably change anything. Washington week ago eastern side state enforced all. see recommendation rather law like drinking driving them. central California weekend also law think saw maybe 4 people masks inside businesses. Also get hate traveling right medical purposes. lots reasons, stories need forefront. First, obviously, highlights fact lot ground living dying. lower expected death rate doesn’t mean shouldn’t take virus seriously. Second, man survived doctor’s efforts lifesaving resources hospital. Allowing rampant spread virus depletes resources time energy healthcare professionals. hospital man overwhelmed cases, chances slim would survived. ""North American ethnicity""? main concern. I'm 31, fit, health conditions. I'm afraid dying get COVID, per se.

I'm afraid *live* damaged lungs. damaged organ. There's people coming severe likely permanent pancreas kidney damage, even relatively young ages.

Any young people feeling invincible likely die misguided. I've pneumonia before. idea living feeling long-term scares shit me. live Chamblee, GA, north Atlanta, morning passed fitness center noticed one mask wearer 8 9 saw exiting. area doomed. T*T NY could Wow...

So bunch hedgefund managers, investment bankers, inhuman suits whatnot get behind something save 5% asses?

**FUCK MONEY! FUCK ECONOMY!!!**

**I WANT DEAD BRETHREN BACK, FUCKING MONSTERS!**

Tell we're living stunted dystopian future again? Isolated yes, purified, no. Nobody used purified particles. Correct isolation purification presumed virus executed. 

It's same. isolated, means sample containing coronavirus. ISOLATED substances.

And yes linking well database find RNA?

You use RNA make primers, set PCR test. Countries using tests, differenes guess lot primers use. Sounds like they’ll front row seat pertinent case study. Yeah know, that’s I’m questioning can’t find calculate percentage number daily cases Minnesota last 14 days steady. hahaha link please?

Let's focus close races winnable. Especially presidency.  Fuck them! assholes left new york spread everywhere! ever you? also striking

Also dumb crap alone people give crap. Wario impersonations go me. screaming them.

Hope helps. Guess nations top infectious disease expert doesn’t much common sense then. lied deliberately public. Either way it’s failure leadership Note eyes ingress point well. Even N95 mask without eye protection would effective. thought sending home die that’s actually happened Still pretty stupid go gym pandemic. Especially stupid gym even sense require everyone face coverings. Well, we’re already well US deaths WWI Vietnam *combined*, I’d wager callousness current population greatly exceeded expectations comes concerns loss life.

WWI: 53,402
Vietnam: 58,220

*Disclaimer: Many lives lost counting sides conflicts. Obviously world wars extremely horrific US entered late game, casualties much lower nations. Vietnam figures US casualties only, including allies Viet Cong, civilian deaths. Still, think numbers tell interesting story many people today ignoring number deaths exceeding we, nation, would accept multi-year conflicts.* joking Unfortunately, everyone wears masks, we’ll get new spikes every “lockdown”.

So we’re fixing anything, kicking road see 3 possibilities. 

1: China worked ass made good vaccine quicker anyone

2: China lied first knew coronavirus, suppressed information order work vaccine anyone else, ready use. 

3: lotta PLA bodies unmarked graves coming next episode Earth 2020! I'm speculating, hotter weather unintuitively cause infection, assuming people inside A/C's on? say summer mini-winter based news, type A/C apparently important could potentially super spreader home workplaces.

Edison displayed poor behavior private lives.  Orange County may turned blue midterms demonstrated time time people still red. Even OC Sherrif want enforce masking.

Without real enforcement lockdowns meaningless forgot waterparks tubing! reap sow believe it. I'd honestly volunteer see reinfection possible provided got low viral load. need information. sure good news. Maybe force us revamp backwards policies? 

Like healthcare? 


Maybe we'll get another stimulus check? 

Idk man I'm struggling too. Pretty low chance well, unfortunately. flu vaccine 45% effective 2019-2020 flu season. 2018-2019 36% effective.

50% really bad minimum. Better would course preferred, 50% would enough make big dent spread. Would definitely change therapy spot Yes, agree, something shifted last two days. Goldman Sachs Pence weighing time means there's concerted (as in, ""in concert"", co-ordinated) shift message elite. real money men, ones stake social stability, finally grabbed helm. literally posted it’s hypocritical close beaches keep amenities open sure bud. Doends much bill is. I'm tipping 7 dollars burger paid 12 for. spend 200 yea maybe give alot bill percentage. 5 great service rare. time I'm ignored meals set down. tip 2. Titles news articles written like legal contract. 1 single comma change intended meaning significantly lay-man’s interpretation. There's small part I'm embarrassed (really appalled) recognize - need order eliminate - much look forward feels hopefully least going bring change.

I *hate* part psyche can't extend much sympathy folks marching straight apocalypse, even they're fighting trying stop them. Cite sources. Noone propaganda like vice does, 70% beds empty, certain places like Mumbai Delhi,etc got overwhelmed even 50% empty beds. amount droplets transfer hands mask subsequently surface miniscule compared to, say, someone wear mask coughs fist grabs doorknob. Wearing mask still overall plus regard.

Plus, part trapped covid particles middle portion covers mouth nose, allowing touch sides mask safely adjust mask.

My point is, touching mask way overblown concern behind mask wearing. long wash sanitize hands touching face eating, fine. Transmission inhalation aerosolized respiratory particles much likely touch transmission anyway, that's whole point.

No one using ""don't wear mask touch infect people"" argument. It’s interesting take. wonder know point return, case maybe that’s route go. title read way makes *not* seem like good news They're influencers wits

edit: goddamnit, seem least one typo every comment. Months. That's quick vaccine. Ch=chimpanzee, Ad=Adenovirus, Ox=Oxford, vaccine uses genetically engineered chimpanzee adenovirus developed Oxford University vehicle (vector) deliver key gene (responsible producing spike protein) SARS-COV-2 virus human cells immune system would react develop immunity. start Phase 3 vaccine good news.

No shit, thanks man. Alex Jones Zuko: MUST RESTORE RELEVANCE!! Well, hopefully second wave missing educational piece. part population taken reopening precautions seriously (and also erred side caution because, hey - we've fucked every step before, fuck up?), subset Americans needed direct lesson.

Fatigue one thing, outright defiance skepticism reality risk. Sucks lot people need burn hand believe stove hot. talk weeks protests thousands people crowding together marching hours end. It’s damn kids playing volleyball beach that’s spreading virus! that's definitely high school physics taught me. Somewhere, someone eating Outback Steak laughing.  go private practice. Oh, possibilities! Hahaha one thing restaurants bars open, another thing entirely individual foolish enough inside one.

It's easiest thing world one them. There's another thread right ""what's something someone make hate them?""

I know hate, see/hear someone complaining wearing face mask public place, I'm confident know everything I'd ever care know them, we're best interacting way. Alright, champ  Someone desperate clicks. Actually probably OPTIMISTIC realistic nominate Utah Jazz? anyone else seeing lot anti mask facebook posts? I'm seeing lot say masks either effective restrict oxygen (despite fact oxygen smaller virus last time checked) causing organ damage. back up, actually say they’re white People worried protests. People also saw necessary. Going large crowd party different going large crowd ask people stop killing you. can’t see difference conversation hopeless. That’s lot testing either.  day Westchester County NY (suburban NYC) tested 3,702 people (40 positive). Yep

Reality is, 99.3%,0of country diagnosed CDC claims 99.6% get survive Vaccine, hopefully becomes available early next year. Flashing George Takei's tweet alt-universe ~500 American deaths due COVID-19. One ~~news~~ entertainment channel talking worst atrocity ever 24/7 Clinton needs kicked office prison, worse. Yeah see now. edited make sure clear, thank you. actually heard internet rumor D3 helped ordered it, symptoms kicked took desperation. US needs people differentiate knowing information novel virus situation lying.

Also, fact mask shortage widely reported time, public encouraged make own, going way back beginning March. CDC even guidelines making masks site back then.

People trying rewrite history like never happened, anyone actually paying attention knew it. lying, people trying pin Fauci still calling damn president still wearing mask. need show symptoms fake it. Iirc nurse order get tested. think people quick forget basic human contact need luxury. people get together safely shame spending holiday together. (Again, emphasis safety)  Lol. thanks thinking me.

I'm paying double average burger one refill. Sorry. going it. need subsidize 15 hour. I'd tip 5 they'd like it. I’m still getting takeout cocktails good spots around me.

Forget year. fucked. applied program year ago already refinanced, rep said something else happens able unfortunately. 

I bought house first place find place rent. point I'll sell move back parents.....embarassing. ok? anxiety get panic attacks make short breath wearing mask around anybody else triggers anxiety. Shit excuse fucking wear one Really good question. everyone getting it? percentage people actually saved it? like 20% severe cases correct? I’m Vietnam it’s effectively eradicated, going two months life back normal. countries probably can’t eradicate it, handful, they’ll ride vaccine. also pay taxes dividends. Typically less pay salary. employ tax avoidance strategies.

So know. Theres that. issue people dont care cases. care deaths. death numbers ramp up, people wont care.   problem landlords tend count rent payments cover mortgage property. don’t get rent default loan loose property. It’s crappy situation around renters landlords. lol i've postpone wedding twice (now date older peopel probably going alive even attend), I've watched stratification society play best friends (half lost jobs nearly homeless, half still ok), I've seen multitude people know contract virus already numbers even spiked, fiancee going front lines people affected covid going forward state blows terms case count, that's top considered high risk virus since bunch co-morbidities associated death long-term problems.

But yea, no, fuckin' care world.

Now I'm 100% certain talking position mis-placed anger, thanks confirming. one friends contracted virus ends dying, fault people ""not understanding shared sacrifice"", it'll people power forced unshared sacrifice realize dying day. I'm sorry, want reopen shitshow part fuckin problem. *raises hand* taking VD isn’t uncommon, take I’ve always deficiency.

Unless evidence mask usage actually low protests, means burden supply data supporting position. Maybe get rethink whole trying force people back work idea. get wanting restart economy, getting work force going. know keeping things Lockdown long terrible idea. 

But, way going it, wrong. start ""Back Work bonus's"" Vaccines Booster shots rolled out. Right now, NEED focus showing people support time need. people need one final round Stimulus Checks. 

I'd rather risk bit inflation, risk dealing death toll rising, people ending streets. linked news article, bro. one ray hope disastrous term, young people white majority become far politically knowledgeable active.

Overall, cost worth (125k dead Americans, internationally trashed reputation, 2 trillion tax cut etc etc etc) *any* positive found miracle. good argument there. Depends company. company currently work gave 90 minute in-office test, write solution 4 different LeetCode style problems needed pass premade unit tests, discussion afterwards.

I barely passed it, brute force one solutions instead right way running time, gave job offer (I saw give test hundreds people pass 99% years since then, kidding, hired 4 people 300 in-person interviews, I'm little surprised passed it).

I interviewed another place since then, test basically 'make sure complete fraud' test, comprising writing function fizz buzz, asking functions I'd write basic web API, basically test see knew link table database. one nice easy, talked experience like work there. spent much time selling job asking experience. ultimately passed me, said great candidate, found better fit.

But rare I've non-FAANG interview ask sort gotcha questions require impromptu performance programming skills, sometimes I'm practice particular language recruiter game almost time prepare.

Once given whopping 24 hours prepare iOS interview, company 2 employees vouching me, used work previous iOS job Lead Programmer, since done iOS programming 3 years way practice Jr Programmer decided take easy way thrust laptop face program manager looking shoulder whole time, struggled passed me. Major corporation too, non-FAANG.

Even everyone this, happens often enough assume going faced even end not, otherwise going find ill-prepared, always demoralizing. I've even made past phone interviews getting one question wrong multiple instances.

Facebook, example, phone screening call particularly bad, pretty clear HR person given list trivia questions realize described right answer, use right term written down. said ""Wrong. answer XXXX."" explanation, nothing else. think asked three whole questions, two right. even get asked technical interview afterwards.

Meanwhile got past phone screening, technical interview engineer, rigorous 6 hour on-site interview Google nothing LeetCode-style questions, least left better taste mouth awful Facebook call.

I could go on. I've failed technical interviews I've passed, yet companies give chance always good experiences employee. gets really tiresome awhile. use drink getting drunk home much better cheaper.  completely agree, brain fucked ways I've never experienced pre-pandemic. I've fighting apathy less 2 months point. Thankfully existential apathy mostly related society, allows continue going motions functional human, works hard helps run household. Hard say ""shit fucked, going die this?"" throughout every. single. fucking. day. could rant hours many negative contributing factors leading us dismal path destined demise, I'll spare others. appreciate putting thoughts universe provided vector expression.

If want blame media protestors adults ""forgetting"" deadly global pandemic idk say standards adult able remember amazingly infantile. really arguing adults cant expected remember global lockdown lasted months 2 weeks protests tv? could seen coming? also American institutions. 

The lack universal healthcare one biggest issues this. healthcare system verge collapse hospitals going broke, health care workers laid wages cut. insane joke.

Workers rights. Corporations given special protections continue force employees work regardless health risks employees recourse regardless mismanaged environment is.

Little protection evictions.

Propaganda networks manifested political power struggle something simple wearing mask.

Little government financial support many currently struggling.

Echoing comments, hospitals must pretty slammed Ducey finally reverse course. 

Still state wide face mask mandate though... kind anecdotal success remdisivir had, ironically one complained lack double blind trials extremely profitable drug. uhh, yield 28k 10 years, 84k 20 years, 196k 30 years caught H1N1 2009. absolutely kicked ass 2 weeks. traced back office tub red vines. I’ve done bunch since may!! high risk? Live anyone high risk? answers go right ahead!! dilemma wanna see friends I’m gunna put life hold end sight. know teachers, parents, kids ever manage that. seems logistically impossible everyone. Animal Crossing Dum dums. every one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know comment add lot value. know else say. mind numb self isolating since late Feb, knowing long go on, seeing dum dums making timeline much longer could been. agree. Remote learning sucks time totally inconvenient kids K-12. Many special needs kids regressing abilities well due this. need get back campus safely possible. It’s teachers, experience, witnessed years calendar committees Phoenix area (my mother works education, got unique perspective growing worked district’s Ed center). 

Teachers like 2 week breaks 25% year passes, exactly. Two weeks fall break, two winter break, two spring break. like winter break fall exactly 50% mark. that, start early get early (before Memorial Day). Exactly. American system complete fail. ""people need think themselves"" Meme worthy. Hope triggered. Seriously. Great idea. Let’s keep people inside virus spreads faster. kids school usually go back July 25-30. it’s private year around school. need compassion others, think ourselves, miss opportunity help someone need. need get together, problem, theirs. hiding, reporting accurately. Africa several places South America reporting. Ecuador one example. approximately 21 thousand excess deaths; total reported deaths less 5 thousand. Peru nearly 30 thousand excess deaths, total reported less ten thousand. little late poor folk.

This criminal. Ah yes, time ""Trump Bad"" comments ts pour in. Guess Europe, Anericas faith fell long time ago, still help out. point dont give fuck think us. faith restored Obama took over

That's large reason Trump got elected. People sick Obama things placate Europeans. jetted around world sucking Europeans middle lower class continued get pillaged.  People give fuck articulate, can't things promised outright ignored people voted going rebuked. Damn that's early Supposedly 10 grade HVAC filter catches viruses. least that’s Home Depot ones say Yep, cancelled membership right everything shut finally got hands squat rack adjustable bench garage. Damn things stock everywhere happened get lucky Facebook marketplace. garage workouts forseable future. wasn’t supposed be, IIRC. wasn’t supposed bar service. Table service only. last job got eye test, doctors visit, dental visit, got $250 incentive.

I went optometrist got $350 bill. asked said ‘it’s free find something wrong. nothing wrong it’s $350’. Correct, many people saying nothing bad useless aware done good things. provide source directly shows daily death count quoted fact gone last three weeks, averaging 200 week, 25-30 per day, highest rate Europe.

**Edit**: OP talking different portrayals data, remarks disregarded till point: Worldometers uses different source exposes three-week backlog. change apparently happened today overwritten old way data presented. Honestly, new way much misleading observing current trend recent deaths previous three weeks tallied inadequately GREATLY exaggerates downtrend. highly recommend reading explanation comparative sources below, new format accurate DATE deaths, greatly underestimates probable number deaths last three weeks. Harper's disgusting even non-pandemic times. Go green, go white... But, but, thought Europeans let anyone starve

/s Also, even spread longer get elderly putting thousands (4.5k NY alone) nursing homes. Everyone aware severity interactions elderly time adjust communication styles, ect. Treatments methods way better NY well. throwing everyone vent low oxygen know needed often. Coming ventilator brutal deadly. media keeps screaming next month bad! keeps ppl watching them. said would 3k daily deaths starting beginning June. I'm paying attention anymore.  president... nah, that's silly kn95's filter out? like n95's? honestly hate Mexican-American, hate brown, wish white, worry things, worried kids would deal bullshit.

Man, white dude never feel way, makes immensely sad. Internet hugs, brother. Yeah totally I'm sure people deffo say proper, I'm aware would make sounds, guess many varied dialects can't see actual Scottish person paying much heed word _supposed_ said haha millennials like college great recession wtf masks stop droplets launched necessarily great preventing exposure wearer. Yes, trust CDC. wrong course thing. make valid point. I'm knowledgeable enough understand repercussions rolling back 1st Amendment (and way advocating that). However, believe right one recklessly make hate comments around social media get away them. Nonetheless, appreciate others' POVs. Statistically even people 60 90% likely survive. live Montreal, QC never heard that’s illegal.. treatment  isn’t one. They’re either cop they’re not. Over/under used point total. guess could set half cop, would silly. spring break 🙄 got squat rack garage couldn’t happier. Finally! Thank god using sense. According section worldometer link proved covers fatality rate Age. That's based Chinese data may discount it. see would make look worse actually is. 

And calculate fatality rate dividing age group died total deaths. That's proportion deaths age. need people age group disease. 80,000 age group 8 died, that's 0.01%  Let’s shut economy ruin chances getting jobs give grandma sue another 6 months fucking hate state much LOL everyone understanding significant. Honestly easier said done could set dedicated institutions older people restrict goes visit them. cares nobody quite, road portable road mobile. still require unpacking assembly site. one deployed Suifenhe took like 6 hours setup overnight arrived. Lol virus woke stayed away thousands thousands mostly young protesters according politics 🤦‍♂️ outraged open protests? literally, can’t stress enough, undid progress made quarantine. 4 months flatten curve completely wasted. think People thought pandemic everything closing actual virus. “worlds greatest country” botch badly? can’t believe spent 4 months inside purposely go way make pointless. People panicked cases uncovered extensively deployed testing. Imagine hysteria could modeled whole thing NYC March. Matrix glitching - can't Trump two viruses running time. NY already hit earlier. got tested UK £0 realize none links contradict anything poster posted? 


A case - essentially posted - negate point protests significant point spread. 5km live. Sounds like total clusterfuck, I’m staying inside next couple weeks. I'm medicaid, stranded Texas. care public health here. corporatized. wait, you’re staying home two weeks right? words Tim Minchin: "" wish they'd feel way gravity. could float fuck away!"" doubt flamethrower would effect pepper spray though. Try visiting actual developing country

Like Poland? water, law enforcement infrastructure. Unlike, example, Flint. ICU/death graph badly done log scale. looks like much steeper decrease actually have. Compare here:  numbers falling naturally, meaning unlikely rise quickly due outside influence. every country fight prevent wave wave, sweden not. Social media media whole needs regulated. Shit spreads like wildfire misinformation tons people fall it. depressing honest. free Netherlands. Yep. he's pretty much retired Microsoft well. He's spending fortune bettering world far remember. seriously believe spending millions treatments malaria african countries business move? exactly believe he's making money that? testing means cases discovered. mild cases discovered, might make virus appear less severe.

In states mean age new cases plummeted. also might make virus appear less severe.

So want know is: holding constant number tests age new cases, deaths less common time March April. Largest percentage increases seem rural counties.

Despite sensationalized news coverage protesters wore. masks Chinese CDC several road portable biosafety level 3 labs

I see reported, makes perfect sense given size country need respond quickly. assume self-contained, self-sufficient tractor-trailer labs dedicated staff need electrical hook-up? Yeah us live places like Florida people. stay home much possible. wear masks. wash hands. carry sanitizing wipes. ones listen made much dangerous us too. know masks work. Mine help Bubba wear one stay face. 

I seen daughter months even though 20 minutes away boyfriend. 

This could different. selfish assholes dragged out, governor failed us, we're gonna lose thousands people lose economy worried gonna worse would they'd done right first place. 

How one organize protest? anyone this? anyone know? Socially distanced sit-in front governor's mansion? really can't take anymore. Largest percentage increases seem rural counties.

Despite sensationalized news coverage protesters wore. masks Yeah absolutely ridiculous, really locked open early, could nice summer. Instead basically start opening early May two months later gonna lock another three months places us ""reopening"" smack dab middle flu season awful means lock AGAIN.

&amp;#x200B;

GET COMFY. Thanks! I'll check out.  Largest percentage increases seem rural counties.

Despite sensationalized news coverage protesters wore. masks started things infection rate slowed significantly

There go. never happened US. forebarence simply extends mortgage number months non-payment interest accrued time would bad possible economic recovery happens increase payment.  outside, wasn’t mask site video Chase Rice posted Instagram. plz stop Sure looks way look way presented.

Which exactly took it.

Did little checking Triage part Care standards, COVID-19 addendum, could used better title, like ""Addendum Care standards Triage procedures COVID-19"", would made much easier see Care standard Triage.

But activated, going put healthcare workers position decide gets care doesn't, sad part particular ""disaster"" ""accident"" ""Mass casualty event"" something essentially caused lack leadership national state level governments, due policies implemented well conditions medical/science types said needed met.

And that's a....

Sigh... concerned rely billionaire government deal this. Pretty sure goes anus seem common US people buy stock? think I've ever come across anyone UK buys stock lol Go city owned gym may (next year). building starters. reminds me: drinking friends went Harvard once, said lot people use condoms school assumed ""if Harvard, probably riddled disease anything."" rest us looked tried explain STDs care smart are. That's Trump thinking there.. wrong. keen cast blame ethnic minorities noticed UK government published information English, could factor spreading among communities many speak different language first presumably read news English. example concrete numbers add general point young people much less affected. fuck listening Bill Gates? Hes FUCKING billionaire cares? Hes fucking doctor. cargo cult billionaires arent fucking messiahs. also noted vote secede time. numbers high big cities, population also high.

Where seeing growth inland counties.

Despite sensationalized news coverage, protesters wore masks Nordborg. assimilated COVID-19. I've H1N1, want live that. Trust me. so? Hey can’t wait lose money extra 600 week need gamble away too. state website? Google it.

The state's lying cause death. death rate gone down, US lying country  sed -i 's/population/new-population/g' Wtf making death threats masks law?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* feel heroic all. lot emotionally numbing see COVID patients unless ICU, almost universally poorly. It’s true CDC recommend masks beginning. Trump-appointed CDC Director Redfield got job praising trump publicly darling evangelical set, despite never actually run public health department kind. simply prepared handle pandemic. Trump-appointed Surgeon General also spoke masks beginning. federal government Trump completely fucked things up, question it. hear ya. I'm blind what's going on, see it. travel work, called back in. Drove Seattle-Tacoma area California, coast, back home 5 days. surprising number people taking precautions. got serious side-eye places wearing mask - fuck care looking sideways caring health?

This lottery want win, I'll keep taking precautions. Im constantly people point crowded beaches without masks social distancing safest place outside sun breeze.



So I'm gonna guess outside sun breeze, wearing masks social distancing must exponentially safer. Oh do? Oh right. Youre idea worse mine. 

This argument already had, sound stupid person tried it. want good little dog work death, means. Go it. 

And cry anyone things go south. nerve call troll come oh funny oh original ""how many zero's"" huhuhu.

Clearly know fuck China, wanted first today ignorant Reddit comments adding 0's. I've lost much faith humanity this. think wearing mask hardship some...many. fucking mask, simple much...and can't even without making politics ignorance.

This crisis first time I've really felt unfortunate live US. ups downs, I've always felt like big population, there's always friction, freedoms cause many friction worth it.

This mess avoidable. Come it’s even july yet!  Wait! happen rights? wanna exericse rights anymore? Morons. drop bucket Jeff better nothing.  Yes they're likely playing game they're gonna broke homeless. Yeah thinking that's nice little gesture kids guess current climate little, would say, tone deaf. generic sold commissary, yeah. somewhat related, listen podcast End World, Josh Clark. 

Basically, summary positions held number philosophers Future Humanity Institute, Oxford University group trying help humanity navigate various threats survival. study ""Existential Risks,"" threats defined ""low-probability, pan-generational crushing events"" (*crushing,* case, referring severity event). short, Existential Risk event likely outcome killing every living human.

Among risks study things like runaway climate change, superintelligent AI, genetic engineering pathogens, high-energy physics experiments. 

The broad position hold humanity precarious time entire history, possibly precarious time entire existence, future included. finally power completely wipe out, yet migrated planets, reduce probability Existential Risk lot.

Anyway, describe sounds like Nick Bostrom (head Future Humanity Institute) calls ""Singleton"" - unilateral governing body authority enter country completely supercede government laws, order mitigate potential risks human civilization. E.g., somebody India working potentially dangerous AI, Singleton enters country arrests them, without deferring Indian authority. 

Bostrom pretty quick point obvious potential Singleton abuse power, even posits constitutes Existential Risk own. Another possibility floats benevolent AI, he's written entire books superintelligent AI incredibly dangerous.

Anyway, seemed like somebody would interested stuff. Well hope got 2 stimulus checks didn't, shit actually costs almost 3.

Not sure getting understand public getting swindled they're getting **free drug** least 6x tax money paid for.

No thing free lunch, Gilead making known. They're charging higher prices US can, government give flying fuck us. damn looks like got money saving feel like lockdown let cat bag. Cooking home cheaper healthier you. Also, exactly like - less sugar/salt/etc.

For myself, plan eating year, take-outs things want cook pain clean - fried foods. even make drinks like matcha frappe milk tea boba drinks scratch. Also, efficient cooking, even clean dishes used prepping cooking, minimizing amount dishes need meal. wife daughter teachers. hits close home. spikes corresponds time date protests latitude outbreaks. number tests declining rapidly along attempt slowing information​, I'm bit wary. know mask usage really like, especially city core, tomorrow announce masks mandatory public transit (Montreal heavily used system). Strongly recommended mask usage indoors, mandated.

I feel like expect less strong resurgence going try downplay people still go spend money. silly speculation.

Yes, I'm still thankful somewhere open super quickly masks kind political thing. I'm following really hoping things get Bergamo NYC levels anywhere else. &lt;3 stay safe, fam. Grew there. awesome drive Disneyland mid May school one else was. Wow good sentiment.. I'm actually going save this. outdoor, spread really low. Like top masks breathing get virus.

There's long, fierce academic debate evolutionary biology circles whether ""true"" philanthropy true altruism really exists.

Honestly, showing signs stereotypical American. and, never anywhere, even know why. that’s took away article, reading comprehension awful. crying sounded like political hit piece read like checklist respect coronavirus.

Anyone read detailed report decide themselves. 

Yes new cases infectious disease likely increase catastrophically painful lockdowns lifted. Unfortunately, infections looked far like death sentence New York elsewhere. Mainly general nurses don’t totally lose track patients, leaving die alone without oxygen. transfer critical condition without medical records. waste $2 billion excess capacity go 100% unused even don’t enough PPE staffing existing hospital beds, let alone new ones. on. .... 

Dude, fucking scoffed numbers virus isn’t problem- flu already kills hundreds thousands people, worse far. can’t fucking moronic. You’ve literally changed argument half dozen times.

Literally everyone comments calling out. Hell, can’t even read fucking source.

You legitimately think 1 1165 people nothing? that’s “young” people. 1 300+ people insane, basically means everyone know least people claimed stats showing difference death rate, since seem incapable reading, don’t seem capable research. Though, suppose go hand hand.

Seriously man, ridiculously uniformed. entire conversation pathetic, completely anti science. trying feel superior makes pathetic- especially since literally seem lack critical thinking. sorry hurt feelings, need recognize Economy completely broken institutions filled people good jobs. 

If feel ashamed want lash fine, recognize acting emotionally know true. didn’t think decent plan basic grasp things work, know it. Good luck. Pasco County, Port Richey: numbers low seniors *are* sheltering place. come center tested seen doctors, see without negative test.

America's stance communitarianism long ingrained since American Revolution. elites somehow managed shuffle us blindly becoming world power global reserve currency institutions built durable. takes commitment everyone safeguard society, failed levels. Yes, leaders failed, people failed well. makes America's indifference coronavirus shocking compared reaction elsewhere world. 2020. gift keeps giving. Pew pew pew! clean small office neither clerks wear masks. put bit fuss manager basically shrugged said long follow 6 foot space rule (which complained- kept forgetting). anyway, one called sick, probably terrible coincidence, face shield ordered specifically show I'm really comfortable working around maskless people comes Wednesday, here's hoping false alarm. can’t really tell yet. I’m going assume deaths per capita less time around since average age infected lower. can’t trust anyone right thing.


That’s literally colonist/Nazi/authoritarian/police state argument  course, hope GOP senate block like Heros Act. agree. That’s also something EU better. Actually support it’s citizens lockdown. mean imply masks. came across dismissive people trying get people being.

Sorry. finished residency hospital contract inmates horrible. many cases andwe couldnt send back two negative tests takes weeks lot cases. disaster. nursing homes. blatantly political post allowed others? thing young peoples getting it, also unknowingly spread peoples high risk. early conclude anything virus currently spread high rate made three months watching North East got hammer, preparation went window due shite opening plan context online learning least average high schooler able logistically use computer reasonable enough attention span get something it.

Elementary education format seems like total disaster. say without ill towards schools teachers trying best. say death? today confirm, SC office closed 2 weeks. Technically still work home mandate executive team senior leadership pushed ""returning normal"" since beginning May basically everyone back office 3 4 days week. Dude u hide cases say 100 them, u'll never find strangers areas get folks tested. 

Basically America right now. so...the states rampaging increases covid-19 help smarten politicians charge? sure done. people rushing bars party. So, ones dumber? pandemic temporary effects children’s education social development permanent. incredibly short-sighted fail understand this. kids grow stunted adults can’t find jobs even function society. social unrest riots begin - large disenfranchised group hope prospects, time tell group futures concerns important enough, worthy sacrifice. They’ll angry, rightfully so. 

The welfare children social/mental development must eventually take priority, even means telling old ill people stay indoors indefinitely everyone else returns ‘normal’ (with necessary precautions like wearing masks maintaining distance possible). No. nothing essential dining in. nothing essential birthday parties. nothing essential hair cut. Forget mitigation, working. freezing terror, stupid.

And repercussions surviving corona severe. someone look lagging death rates also ignore complications infection means they're listening science. also roughly 40 9/11s didn’t go overnight. Look 7 day averages see deaths ramping two months since peak late April/early May. Quarantine room adequate airflow one family member responsible care. Provide fluids etc. make sure everyone masked while. Keep windows open, would use air exchange fan. (Moves existing air pulls fresh air in) wash hands surfaces, change gloves, masks often. likely around prior symptomatic. Take care begins struggle breath take emergency call ambulance. safe take care other🙏🏻 Goddamnit, Billy..  There's need reach grandoise point here. Protecting ultimately personal actions, tons Americans unwilling necessary. Blaming society easy way lot shitty behavior. Oh totally agree point. 

Was responding concerns ill handling masks- particular issue may big deal. love posting humble folks like you. Trump right wrong UV. feel dumber situation several AZ’s hospitals 2 days ago. It’s getting worse... know. Every downvote that’s accompanied counter argument feels like 10 upvotes chill Florida seeing double ""random deaths"" ""influenza"" cases far year. Weird man. *cowers San Bernardino county* thank god don’t beaches Probably inflammatory processes resistance such? Looks like previous Coronaviruses exposure grant antibodies longer one year less Waaaaaaaah!!! 

Ok want way. Here’s $500 dollar fine complying. next time caught without one, $1500. stupid enough get point get caught third time, you’ll spend week jail. gain wearing masks? hope families careful, otherwise 'Patriots' invade home rifles scream making Dear Leader look bad.

How much longer get point threatened murder wanting exposed deadly virus? Also businesses (well, responsible large ones) won’t send people states can’t come back from. think good based number highly unusual loud parties last weekend neighborhood fear people irresponsibly turn indoor house parties hope major accidents happening.

there actually might another swine flu pandemic year Boris Johnson somehow smarter stay ICU COVID-19? Oh? so. contradicting evidence data goes nearly every doctor world? Since it’s genetic, bad lost genetic lottery.

But need figure whole Karen electorate pruned November, presidency easy win Biden. nurse, ICU nurse south. exhausted... ICU, still deal regular load well shifted onto/off COVID patients. Even COVID ""rule outs"" end consuming huge amounts effort, test results come back, precautions taken (gown/n95/negative-pressure/etc). Works shirts.  new information arose? We've known upper respiratory illnesses spread long time. Actually kinda this: Obama Pandemic Paper, initiated W people, Trump tossed. Obama’s name it. I’m sorry global pandemic that’s true. responsibility other. Stop spreading stupid opinion please, sakes. 

Bad take, bud. Try harder next time. Ben &amp; Jerry's eat since danged ole liberal company. hot dogs baked beans. People like McConnell gladly burn country get charge ash heap. Yeah, supposed take normal emergency room patients, people car accidents heart attacks whatever get covid process treated. wound patients everyone staying home afraid go hospital. Hysterical people internet outraged (as usually are) ship sitting empty hospitals near capacity. ship eventually started taking people without confirming covid negative, due nature ships, became infected.

 tried explain many people subreddit ships terrible places treat covid victims, received well. 

Side note: NYC height pandemic there, heart attack, stroke, OD victim numbers dropped precipitously, even though normally steady. assume many people died home. tourists though, good problem apparently Gotta get tuition money everyone. Then, August, announce classes held online only. Take hoser, can't come in, aye ... here. Got tested Orange County Convention Center two weeks ago. told results would come 72 hours. Received 7 half days. Negative, thankfully, nearly useless wait long results. guess it’s genetic really. Maybe it’s blood type, maybe it’s immunity prior coronavirus, knows lol customer always right originally stocking consumers wanted buy demand most. CA website updated data? update numbers previous day everyday 11 plan sending kids back school San Francisco still relatively stable, things considering. much know virus means people's health long term. people saying kids somewhat immune get sick people say healthy young men women likely get sick it. exploding numbers. vaccine, cannot see safely open schools. course better worse realistic option. question if, when. Speaking ventilators, it’s funny subject completely went away media like April so. I’m sure ventilators way first line choice treatment, saying almost like guarantee don’t wear mask? 

Do patients need ventilator? 99%? 

Hmm. reason data doesn’t back fearmongering statement. Wear mask don’t scare people thinking COVID going put ventilator data shows different. Come guys. Lol man should’ve stayed sick. Incredible bro. Fuuuuuck. Totally forgot that. live south DC frequently go northern Virginia. Might reconsider bit.... gotta liberate yourself. People get liberated foreign influence, survive said liberation, often suffer even worse conditions afterwards. UK scientists suggested several things government chose ones liked. FA promptly closed football grounds governments choice keep open. Made government scientists look incompetent. long since recovered? 2-3 months? city (Austin, TX) failing massively right 

They recently stopped asymptomatic testing can’t keep demand. people taking long get results back processing tests people severely ill. Anyone else wait 8-14 days get results back probably won’t sick anymore. despite testing failure still reporting 500-600 cases day. feels hopeless it’s giving much anxiety. least people seem staying based cars see road. get scare masses shitless get agenda come on. laughed read headline. become big joke sub become fear porn mainstream media propaganda. Jesus fucking Christ people. theweek.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yet gives new precise direction researchers follow! Fucking idiots.

Mayor tried save dumbasses.

Chip deny medical care. was... Shortsighted Well luckily chances are, much longer 2020 anything say wish best parents. Hopefully AZ gets herd immunity soon safe. true unfortunately. may more, know live. So, business longer issue requirements chooses operate... Thanks confirming 'Patriots'. poor, poor bankers really need support. Let's clap send money fruit baskets. Poor bankers. I've told president economy great shape fast recovery...5%. Pshhhh Europe knows let plague rats matter what. Honestly, kind bs got us here. comparable all. Racism, sexism reasons ever voted Trump turn national disaster US

I think hit national disaster stage time ago. read articles new tests, approved get tests quickly people. swabs shorter, need go 1"" 1.5"" nostril, self administered, swab made material readily available.

The articles also said accurate standard tests people symptoms, sure accurate asymptomatic people. warning people. safe ffs prob control yes...speeding yes too. Kinda like driving car fast...still control. machine help breathe automatically mean ventilator. Lots people emphysema get oxygen tank. mean, still sucks balls, less death sentence ventilator? 🤷‍♀️  Yeah I'm pretty sure already found person I'm going marry. shit need know language bachelor's/training specialized field immigrate normally, that's common knowledge. However Germany prove parents/grandparents German citizens apply it. Upon learning yesterday expressed sentiment wish mine could easier route go debt US college. see something amiss here?

Nopes, nothing all!

This article 21st Jan, irrelevant known late March April. It’s funny cause it’s true. :cries harder:  virus ""under control"" since March according white house. white house believed former administration spying using microwaves... Seems legit. Lived since toddler always called that. link nothing headline?? Maybe stop putting animals kinds conditions?  surprised many truly selfish/ignorant people are... really brought view here. hope businesses know loosing customers fail take seriously Yeah don’t think people know vigilant means...my partner highly asthmatic taking ZERO chances.  IKR still 30 days worst fucking flu life 

It's like, really want experience feels get lungs containing less less oxygen.  Side note - goddamn sick corporations putting cutesy commercials message. No, together Mercedes-Benz/Coca Cola/Grubhub; quit trying take advantage crisis fuck off. hope people refuse wear masks refuse wear ventilator. Especially shortage someone else needs it. Okay young people need form relationships. sustainable ask celibacy someone years. used growing up, even places parent. district terrible. They're unwilling unable pay drivers extra time, don't. Yes! States profile, ""My calling pandemic era, fight misinformation sides, hope might better future side.""

It's imperative intelligent ethical people begin look past fear-inducing clickbait news (including uncritical reporting terrible efforts science cases) learn real science...*from actual scientists*! bad bad news. employer decides healthcare? Decides going infect coworkers? might start chain infections may take someone health issues? make take test not? Get care not? sounds like ownership me, employment.


Time new employer asap. take 2+ hours pick children 20-30 families built area. might take long rural area. No, daily maskless Trump rallies mandatory body fluid exchange. warning sign Iran nearly month increase cases increase deaths. average number cases US began noticeably spiking June 19th, expect deaths would spike going to. Well honestly last election great lineup first place, either trump hillary. I'm US voted would idea pick. Ok fine. tiny fraction people die require respirator. 
But hard wear mask?
I want stop spread, get country back towards semblance normal. Wearing mask effective towards that. whole ""we lied public mask efficacy enough supply medical staff"" thing? Nobody. Vivint salesman come door without mask yesterday. Mask wear currently mandatory state. Thank god video doorbell, could figure tell gtfo without actually exposing myself. dad get test (assuming will). Probably either way, plan wait week two sorted out.

You're working artificial deadline- there's reason postpone, prefer to. simple, wait week two information keep simple. Well look who's back r/conservative ready admit surge cases occurring. admitting caused releasing restrictions instead blaming protests. Probably people sharing viral load become ill, also infectious, different rates depending body reacts That's good point. thought anchoring effect across metric like money. makes feel worse.... Texas opened early, also problem. protests contribute issue. matter bad be. We're still less year brand new virus, would make sense predictions perfect. No? leave ""this weekend"". took month realise this? fucking fault too. It’s good news asymptomatic basically immune lol.

For everyone else, fucking sucks almost everyone wearing masks though. heard phase ""The straw breaks camel's back""? I'm saying one easy straw 3 months ago, it'd easy bear. isolation, lost jobs, debt, even police intervention, one little straw one top large pile. 

Good limits end day, person responsible health only, ever be, yourself. I’ve wondering report businesses following rules. Yelp perfect! definitely make lot. 

After taxes paying people pay handle affairs making ton. Would agree would prudent absolutely nothing covid-19 good data everything happening? Exact counts every death, exact knowledge death rates, exact knowledge R values, exact understanding transmission modes, etc? didn’t situation new. make many assumptions. Many turned wrong. Would rather sat back waited perfect data come in? acted expert’s front line gut impressions everything could gather data simultaneously reacting best could based best assumptions time? Obviously can't read, tis ok, I'll help young places even going back March open now, 2 cases could traced gyms area South FL 30 mile radius.

But hey 'pandemic' 10s thousands protestors allowed encouraged word word left libbys let alone bs. Oh lets shut gyms, oh dirty naughty gyms everyone going die at.... fast forward basically July gyms open month here, yet 2 cases that's traced gyms South FL entire shutdown. Oh Lowes, grocery stores etc slammed packed basically social distancing, pictures Walmart even set foot 500ft near one anyway. gym meanwhile, even every machine wrapped blocked off, disinfectant bottles grab walking yourself. Fuck, gum cleaner safer places people going including grocery stores cases upon cases traced here. 

Btw family members, 7 ER state let alone nurses know including two icu covid wings Borward. blown proportion that's coming even couple super liberal. Heck hospitals busier flu season 2 years ago entire time. Oh 100% agree. 

I'm saying bar owner, I'd want able follow rules typical dining. 

That said, I'm bar owner think moronic go indoor dining bars right now. I'm one absolutely forced wear mask, AMA actually lose seats next election. make ton sense. voting block skews elderly. acknowledge Coronavirus hoax, going stay away polling stations. 

They're also ones likely die it. 

Honestly, bronzer explanation least makes sense.  I'm certain i'm planing get plane year weak leadership gives want, think “great, let’s disagree”. hijack thread, somebody knows they're talking explain death rate (not sure correct term) continued steadily decline despite whatever case load happened be? entirely due lag new cases, factors play? Better treatment/those risk died fastest/states cooking books? anyone links discuss detail I'd interested read it. need start treating like terrorists are. Even 50% asymptomatic, 5% symptomatic people hospitalized, that's 4 million people place hospital beds 6 months.

Edited, 4 millions, 2. people wear even N95's They’ve saying “this beginning” months now. Obviously it’s gonna get worse, we’re long past beginning. Tacky. 

I understand frustration struggle, come on. RIP Orange County Utah, mask mandate, 3 day average cases tripled six weeks. Masks salve problem, help. use site quickly check friends family different states counties see things doing. uses different datasets, brings one place, works well phone.  Kid beach....""Mommy? water go??"" I’ve stressed fuck since found announcement July 1st. Cooper started strong, closed pretty early, think GOP pressure caused open early lag mask mandate. Here’s hoping doesn’t get pressured full opening. Confiscating private property someone tried violate quarantine order different state abso-fucking-lutely way go. Christ. read article agree misleading.

The article trying use trick words show ""reciprocity"" applys everyone China excluded completely like US. fact moment China got speical ""provisionally approved"" Taiwan have. man. 

People STFH. \*sigh\* Learn cook. hard get decent. Really good work, decent hard. Agreed. think probably stop talking people refuse. gives antivaxxer movement momentum giving attention. believe Americans want get first wave get later. won’t mind getting first wave personally, understand people would prefer go second round. people completely reasonable shouldn’t lumped antivaxxer group, often polls news stories. need based infection number increase rate America.   I'm sure long antibodies lasting, good evidence cell mediated immunity, see obviously soon tell Covid cell immunity typically last years. best knowledge, single person confirmed re-infected, lot recovered patients live high prevalence areas, pretty good indirect evidence degree immunity. agree that, sometimes, things worth dying (thinking protests, idiotic Karens ""freedom"" morons). Try working hospitalit_foody; almost norm depending work benefits. DC That's unfortunate preventable. Tens thousands people needlessly dying.   incredibly shocking. 100,000 cases day means administration failed badly remembered century more. truly devastating. Imagine even 0.1% get intubated. 70% depends reproduction number.

If 3 around 70%

1 person infect 3 others. number 1 less stop epidemic. 2 3 immune, everything stops.

2 3 66%.

If would bring reproduction number things like masks. herd immunity would lower percentage.

Let's say mask lowers reproduction number 2. One person would infect two others. one immune, herd immunity would 50% long everyone wears mask. stops epidemic starts again.  Planes HEPA filters. Trains don’t. need Americans here, countries Europe we're responsible enough deal pandemic. last thing need spoiled kids think world revolves around come start spreading again. guys understand freedom ends another person's freedom starts, act responsibly good others own, maybe welcome again.
Until hope guys take heads asses stop acting like children (well even worse children guess).

This directed you, know ppl sub head right place. venting frustration seeing what's happening there. beyond insane! also types people try argue data-driven assertions one-off exceptions.

Me: ""Your socioeconomic status born reliable predictor one end in.""

Random commenter: ""I born poor upper middle class, therefore statement false.""  think poor written report. Proper title would : China Vaccine made Army academy enter clinical phase III. thing though Philly arguably biggest marches country. One apx 15-20K.

Philly experiencing small upticks past week pretty much line expecting slow reopenings. past 2 weeks social media posting pics bars full masks. don’t doubt protests didn’t help, think depends crowd wearing masks. also think house parties happening, too. think it’s combo everything.  sucks doesn’t matter amount stories coming out, won’t able stop popping future. lot parties blame that, it’s honestly gotten past point controlling. r/COVID19 great one scientific resources isn’t really political all. go one depresses much. Yup. point going decide costs outweigh benefits? effects far reaching, mind blowing try comprehend it. ...from upcountry? Part problem summer. Texas hot fuck right now. People going AC. BINGO! 

If masks mandated -- profit made, losses avoided.

Expect masks mandated federal statute, signed law, COB tomorrow. months, *The Washington Post* rest mainstream media kept morbid Covid-19 “death count” front pages top news broadcasts. coronavirus outbreak number dead. narrative intended boost governors like Cuomo New York Whitmer Michigan, turned states authoritarian false notion destroying people’s jobs, freedom, lives would somehow keep virus viruses always do: spread population eventually losing strength dying out.

The “death count” always headline.

But sudden early June mainstream media George Orwell lectured us “cases” always “cases.” Death, especially infection fatality rate, irrelevant. Why? peak April, deaths decreased 90 percent continuing crash. terrifying enough media pretended good news exist.

With massive increases testing, “case” numbers climbed. rocket science: people test “cases” discover.

Unfortunately mainstream media interested pushing “party line.” good news millions exposed fatality rate continues decline – meaning virus getting weaker – buried hysterical false reporting “new cases.”

Unfortunately many governors, including Texas, incapable resisting endless lies mainstream media. putting Americans nightmare forced business closures, mandated face masks, restrictions Constitutional liberties based false propaganda.

In Texas “second wave” propaganda gotten bad leaders four major hospitals Houston took extraordinary step late last week holding joint press conference clarify scare stories Houston hospitals overwhelmed Covid cases simply untrue. Dr. Marc Boom Houston Methodist said reporting hospital capacity misleading. said, “quite frankly, we’re concerned level alarm community unwarranted right now.”

In fact, much reporting “spike” Texas cases due resurgence virus hospital practices Covid-testing every patient coming procedure all. it’s positive, well counts “Covid hospitalization.”

Why would hospitals dishonest diagnoses? Billions appropriated federal dollars funneled facilities based number “Covid cases” produce. I’ve always said, subsidize something get it. that’s getting Covid cases.

Let’s go back original measurements used scare Americans giving Constitutional liberties: daily death numbers. Even though know hospitals falsely attributed countless deaths “Covid-19” deaths instead virus, seeing actual deaths steadily declining past month half. Declining deaths great way push “second wave” propaganda, media politicians moved goal posts decided “cases” important. It’s another big lie.

Resist propaganda defend liberty. way we’ll get this. article:

 Suspected confirmed coronavirus patients account 35% beds.

What filling rest beds?  every state border toll booth. vast majority likely aren't. Whenever topic comes people envisioning EU style borders they're American, are, various toll booths bridges dividing states see driving I-95.

That reality state borders.

As example, look relatively small border New York Massachusetts. Yes, includes highways toll roads, also includes rural streets, town centers small towns along border, even residential streets border 2 neighbors' houses.

You easily find dozens roads types almost neighboring states, little sign even telling different state

The thing see conceivably working patrolling major highways states even dealing tons false positives people driving state. get concerns, closest one market right (Oxford AstraZeneca's) *very* rigorously tested effectiveness safety, right I'm typing this. major countries world already signed agreements stock ready mass rollout moment positive results come back (if, hopefully, do) AstraZeneca already started production said product (and they're confident enough risk losing billions ends failing all)... I'd imagine probably going end safe effective.

Virginia well still hot balls don’t need 600lb deadlift order maintain optimal health... interested deadlift, whatever reasons, explore alternative methods means accomplishing outside gym.

To ignore situation try frame argument around needless feats strength pathetic. USA already invested 1.2 billion dollars Oxford vaccine - 300 million doses due USA October.

\^\^ Upvote this. sad truth America. Good know long could take vaccinate majority population? 

For global pandemic end you’d need likely least 4 billion people vaccinated otherwise immune, substantially more. 

Even vaccine launched tomorrow would likely years pandemic declared over.

In world honestly believe get 4+ billion people immune less couple years? Also keep mind pandemic ending two years doesn’t mean life can’t back normal(ish) then. global scale way hell ends less year unless virus falls face earth la SARS 1.0. way put use military test vaccin don’t get false positives diagnostic tests. would like accidentally building flying plane. many things go right get positive. False negatives hand occur 20% time. Yeah, many feelings hurt? Swedish Defense Force, Danish Attack Legion, and, well guess leader sole member Waifus Hypocrites. mascot red panda, obvious reasons.  DARE SAY /s didn’t ask it, Chinese shared none less huh? way important risk get vaccine healthy. 10% chance dying COVID, 2% chance complications vaccine way acceptable 1% chance dying COVID.

Those numbers entirely made up, trying show math risks changes significantly risk dying COVID.  There's silver lining virus deadly, kills hosts faster spread. SARS 1 Ebola become truly global pandemics despite far deadlier SARS 2 years (decades ebola) they've around theyve killed many people SARS 2 half year. human psychology, even 20%+ fatality palpable frightening, something like 85% would like gun face, 0.5% tangible end morons going ""its flu"" response. old ""frog boiling water"" analogy adequate. Ontario, fine wearing seatbelt [$200-1000](http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/safety/safe-driving-practices.shtml). seatbelt really protects mainly . 

But masks protect everyone come contact with. think $200 eminently reasonable. needs real deterrent value. You’re problem. Cause I’ve planned months /s 

I know many people traveling I’m sitting watching Ohio’s numbers rise daily think slightly overblown thing. 

The travel ban applies ways USA also remains closed Europeans. EU works basis reciprocity, EU allow Americans in, USA also allow Europeans in. 

Also Americans singled thing. list accepted countries currently quite short.

Lastly countries inside EU free ignore rules welcome Americans countries. done yet. Help Please: Long Need Air Garage?

I heavy item delivered. left garage door open made arrangements (over phone) delivery person leave garage. left garage door open (8) minutes delivery person left closed remotely. contact person. garage maybe two minutes wearing mask. 

When safe go garage? open garage door let air longer? so, long (I want leave open longer necessary theft reasons). know COVID stay three hours air - assumed without air circulation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!!! Thanks people 60, yes. Depth quake type faulting important too. Good guy, Banksters. Yeah agree. big outbreaks seem hot areas people tend spend days inside AC. Combine reopening high risk places get surge. Catholic, I'm inclined believe inversion mention Protestant. 

Our parish, authority Bishop, taken *extreme* measures ensuring safety. 30 40 people service (those cathedrals huge inside), singing, high social distancing measures, sanitizer, face masks mandatory, etc. Anyone refusing argumentative banned Church pandemic over. 

Protestants hand, restrictions. Wife's cousin big one; zero social distancing, zero masks. fact, church packed every week. Even mention idea wearing mask get incredibly shitty defensive. 

Yeah God protects, also gave man intelligence brain. say wearing mask best. Teacher asking, students schools also? That’s minimum wage Seattle. $600 week would barely cover rent studio (or close to) city, let alone anything left cover food utilities. respective government likely resources take lot load friends, direct ire towards instead people still job.

That change fact far many people fail realize pandemic effecting everyone equally ... even close.

For people paid 4 month vacation get work home wearing pajamas, others government intervention crush businesses spent years building.

Far many people see side coin, see situation.

They talk ""how lockdown bad all"" ""they get people complain this"", talking ""so nice drive office"" wonderful ""go midday walks"". people call want things reopen ""evil"" ""selfish"".

They fail see situation effect least, others getting fucked hardcore want sort forward momentum chance preventing built destroyed; can't forever.

People like say ""we're together"", that's case. equal sacrifice across board. even fucking close. bot like r word Super leaders specific countries try enact policies actions prevent spread.

I like touch realism breaks suspension disbelief. mean mandate law. Set police enforcement. police never issue ticket areas people follow laws generally. I'm going wait bit tested.

So appreciate volunteering! think people downvoting expectation reasonability current political climate complete pipe dream. Good question snd good news too!... research shows kids great spreading it, either.

""According research, 18 confirmed cases 15 schools resulted two additional transmissions among 881 close economy

That might get leaders attention. almost like want shit stop. aggravating How? eye Sauron something? Disneyland reopen. Exactly. Like many aristocrats history. They'll figure out! Wisconsin literally cannot shut unless state legislature approves it, won’t. we’re going flounder. saving lives FFS. Masks massively reduce spreas infectious diseases, surgeons nurses wear them.  news stories saying infecting humans, causing disease humans. Long term damage really isn’t issue. I’m assuming read somewhere subreddit.  Sunshine State like 16% positivity rate? county South FL I'm sure chronic, Fauci absolutely liar. Since old man got cancer yes do. Thats like addict says, eh wont od heroin. least fentanyl lmao That’s rate pushing

Huh? Nobody expertise/experience pushing .02% fatality rate. yeah, want it, death one terrible possible results. survive really bad shape rest life. Oh yes, we're going whole new view thing year, prediction firmly held, makes sense me- areas virus widespread, spread widely. 

The impact means protesting might safe areas virus spiking, might areas lower spreads. matters, protests viewed public impact outcome. Sure.  Deaths always lagged behind cases Yes. demanding. federal government supports citizens pandemic.

Instead slave driving plague rats demanding everyone get back work reason. feel exact way saddens there's even many people know consider good friends even taking seriously anymore, complaining entire time stay home orders. 

I guess little different living rural Midwest we've handful people sick area I'm at. worry everything back open, large crowds back churches, summer fairs coming people going traveling around could spread easily even rural areas. Especially since people around taking precautions since think virus overblown know anyone it. learning game 5 year old came teach Coronavirus spreads. playing this, find better informed less afraid. Yeah, proudest moment. *Yellowstone

(Or Long Valley Caldera, guess!) wear mask filter inbound traffic lungs.  masks work.

 responsibility protect yourself, therefore wear mask want. otherwise mind business whether others wear masks not.  

let downvotes begin subreddit love idea one wearing masks? Literally vast majority people wearing masks you’re 6 feet apart care. virus still obey laws physics. It’s airborne. welcome. Anytime feel doubt I’ll reassure you. Hehe, yeah, think stupid already smarter most. mandate buy fools refusing wear now. mean, think rushing dine inside dumbass assholes? Oh no! hyperbole intended. meant insidious proceeding subtle way, without noticeable effects. Ie: asymptomatic carriers perpetuating spread virus.. totally right cold flu viruses also spread infected individual shows symptoms. suspect might missing something reply.. That's state punish shops allow people without masks in. need public controllers go store store check find people without masks fine shops happens close shops while. people upper management would soon change tune case customer without mask would get anymore.    America gets voted cant. dont volunteer, select you. 50% better 0% Von mir aus auch gerne als Präsident... Ich wähle sowieso keine CDU. Agreed.

For most, symptoms appear 3-5 infected, day after.

How know get somewhere else?

This article scientific enough. Absolutely. farmers market last weekend South bay, outdoor 100÷ people still wearing mask. say population mostly Chinese.... born raised Las Vegas. absolutely confirm. already existing travel restrictions place (between US European countries) citizenship matter. European citizens currently freely travel back home countries, even need transit 3rd EU country. starting July 1st able visit EU country home country.

I doubt EU regulations going make stricter, preventing EU citizens travelling back country citizenship. Video don’t need teach people patience. need teach politicians patience conviction.

No politician (especially conservative ones) wants limit people’s freedoms guise safety, sometimes laws necessary stop people irresponsible. texting driving illegal places, wear helmet motorcycle, etc.No matter what, dumb people/business owners put everyone else risk. can’t educate people, control them. 

Hell, wait 2 half hours get tested boss let friend waltz office (which shouldn’t open) mask Friday friend tested positive Sunday. boss closed office, everyone get tested, asking everyone whose tests negative come back in. (When us able work home.)

Stupid people stupid matter what. Even face consequences. horrible things named EA. good start. Absolutely mask compliance different subcommunities. offer anecdotal evidence living Coachella Valley. say live one cities lower rate infection, leave house go shopping stay within little city. sometimes see unmasked people walking dogs riding bicycles, usually alone pairs. wish wearing masks, think that's quite bad wearing mask store full people.

Thanks again. 88% death rate ventilators reported NY eased ventilating people. reevaluated number later, though clear why:  really ""hyperviligant""

I think that's problem right there. ""hypervigilant"" instead. Maybe even ""vigilant"" would fine. I'm SC. Got tested Thursday morning, still gotten results. statement? 

We've responded horribly Covid. I'm saying professionals study kind thing understand general good practice responding situations, apparently neither politicians large parts populace want trust advice.

Are implying stories fabricated exaggerated? Small businesses hit *hard* closures. much obvious, no? Lol drawn up. It’s statewide election trying say? figures smaller states horrifying 1/44 infected tops that.

We need laws deal virus, punishments. People stupid. ""Ignorance law excuse"" throw damned jail cell fine hell them. lot us really sick shit, wondering we're going lives ruined due others' stupidity.  strongly suspect civilian-grade masks almost equally effective worn sick person vs healthy person. 

If sick COVID, putting people around risk coughing, pushes COVID-laced air lungs 50mph mask. air take path least resistance, means large amount particles go sides mask vs directly it. basic physics.

On flipside, healthy person wearing mask risk breathing IN, action actually pulls mask closer face. I'm actually wondering done this? feel barely interviewed anyone who's actually experienced Covid themselves. always doctor, pundit commenting means Trump. 

How giving us actual human stories, media? We’d already flattened NY/NJ lot people antibodies see happened Chicago months ago tried something like that?

You hordes people packed tight indoor spaces hours time, takes people popped Tylenol mitigate fever potentially expelling closed area getting many others sick

Can't pocketbook consumers dead. Paywall close it... people know meaning words, that's newspeak marketing work well....


In French say ""état providence"", something like ""the state provides""... sounds better welfare state... remember last week Brazil announced 34k cases day. US much winning, getting sick it. Right?! People need start pressing charges stop letting rude ass people get away tantrums, harassment assault.

People behave like know consequences actions.  likely wouldn’t flat license everyone. would probably cut-offs based percentages class ranks, average pass rate school, etc. 

also would likely requirements would met, 2 years licensed attorney, supplemental classes exams... would likely “everyone passes!” situation. 

source: i’m studying ass bar keeping date shitty situation. There's nuance here:

Our system geared efficiency. good, match resources closely needed, rather buying little much.

However, random nature world, sometimes many customers supplies fill needs. Normally excess demand minor corrected within hours days.

This different. Nobody designed system enough extra supply sitting around meet demands pandemic.

But that's can't designed system, chose to. choice. 

There's good reasons made choice, there's good reasons consider making different choice future. us decide. trade was, wanted close economy, close not. live AZ, absolutely make sense.  can't rent tubes, bring own, fine.  can't rent tubes, Lakes Rivers open.  supposed wear mask everywhere, unless find hard breathe exercising.

 Ducey trying play sides streets, wants pretend like he's acting best interests AZ without needing take blame economy falters.  He's wishy-washy coward way head, plan, terrible advisors clue do.  problem AZ government highest levels politicians, single one actually know work get shit done. 

 

When Ducey opened state May, actually withheld power municipality require masks close anything down.  withheld June 18th.  gave back power. And, cities around Phoenix put emergency order day requiring masks.  county cover municipalities think wearing masks liberal conspiracy.  

 

Arizona's leadership plan controlling spread COVID-19 shitshow.  believe anybody telling anything different.  Businesses going suffer.  Wage workers already suffering.  CARES Act benefits run out, Arizona going millions people dire straits.  And, even taking consideration Arizona's ICU spaces already almost 90% capacity (as day two ago, figures today yet).  

 

It's wonder Arizona worst percentages entire world COVID-19 spread. Wow, TEENS want go socialize friends completely isolated 3 months. blame them? would've saved countless lives dollars, possibly dignity politicians.  could just, y’know, close borders China.

That’s people saying NYC looking Italy. reality is, Arizona hmm lagging behind. Give 1-2 weeks look like Florida American testing supply chain stretched limit, ongoing outbreak South West could overwhelm it, according epidemiologists testing-company executives. country’s laboratories added tremendous capacity past months—the U.S. tests 550,000 people day, fivefold increase early April—demand viral tests outpacing demand continues accelerate shortages resolved, turnaround times test results rise, tests effectively rationed, number infections never counted official statistics grow. plan contain virus depend fast accurate testing, identify newly infectious people set new outbreaks. Without it, U.S. dark.

Even crazies believe masks build co2 moron trying defend Trump crazies ran it. reality, orange buffoon, Fox News, OANN would tell to. would still detractors, likely, would probably help most. also never happen. Deaths lagging Indicator. look Italy worldmeter right now... 240578 cases/ 34,768 deaths converging mortality rate 15% closed cases versus new cases equalize. United States may better, currently 2.7 mill cases, even testing finding milder cases, still 10% mortality. So, current cases settle, 270,000 deaths. additional exponential growth now, 5 mill cases likely, around 500k deaths November 0.15% population 1.5 per thousand. understand he's really good taking new information adjusting views. /s perfectly happening. People acting like ignorant morons suddenly happens they’re benevolent Karen’s *Surprised Pikachu Face* Totally agree. profit not-for-profit boat. issue not-for-profit high administrative cost spent per dollar raised. especially true majority children hospital systems. hospital/system CEOs make $1M per year (not kidding).

First, disagree parent post, ""Definitely. can’t think much nonessential gym hairdresser rn"". means think gyms non-essential. say think gyms first indoor spaces open. also say ""clothes stores open pubs opening weekend"" -- indoor spaces opening. Therefore, think gyms least opening weekend higher priority (to you) clothing stores pubs. 1+1=2 good sir. teach math too. wish living Europe...  point is, dont believe happen parts country desensitization. dont think people paying attention beyond fox news tells them.

that is, dont believe currently sensitive situation. cause new york break doesnt mean alabama cared. reopening propaganda demonstrated none thought problem.

thats desensitized thats ignorance. That's impossible calculation LOL CAN'T BREATHE MEME'S WRITE try give folks benefit doubt. fairly long face sometimes talking (or yawning) pull mask nose feel self-conscious fixing people watching supposed touch face either.

Tourist regions [in Sweden] may greater burden healthcare summer patients covid-19 staff. shown Public Health Agency's forecasts.

- Public Health Authority's worst case scenario, would need take action beyond plan lies ahead, may prioritizing care even affecting employees' vacations, hope land, says Markus Lingman, chief physician strategist hospital management Halland's hospital.
For summer, Public Health Authority analyzed evolution spread infection based keep social distance.

In tourist regions Kalmar, Gotland, Halland Dalarna, highest number guest nights relation population, tourists assumed able get started spread infection quickly.

The authority calculated could mean possible care load.
The forecast shows Halland Kalmar get around 80 covid patients time inpatient care around ten intensive care unit, iva.
So many extra care places regions summer, hand plans expand rapidly.

Kalmar's Health Medical Director Johan Rosenqvist hopes summit, forecast predicts, come end August.

- larger part staff back holidays, work way spring change mobilize care places.
- see major difficulties achieving it, says Johan Rosenqvist.

For Gotland, prognosis points 25 covid patients outpatient care four ICU.

According Cathrine Malmqvist , head health care , region planned regular summer, always means increased pressure tourists, says plan expand.

The valleys, hardest hit four regions spring, projected able reach peak end summer.

- becomes trace, keep nose waterline, serious accidents things happen time, says Lotta Olmarken Ingler, Health Medical Director Dalarna Region.

Calling staff holiday included plans four regions, last resort.

The need take care summer requires everyone take responsibility, says Gotland's health manager Cathrine Malmqvist.

Not sure much drug plan insurance covers via employment weekend, small group friends gathering semi-private outdoor space, wearing masks distancing. Someone came started berating insulting us taking precautions, refused leave time.

So people literally looking excuses throw fit even nothing whatsoever. think Fauci stage he's said ""fuck job, people dying, least try get control Trump damned"" really nothing surprising American it.

PS years, get COVID hospitals known good/ good Marin? would go SF something serious? one going give martyr status dude March 8th 60 Minutes Extra. comes says non-infected wear masks. interviewers repeat questions giving chance clarify. Dr Fauci doubles saying provide perfect protection actually cause Surgeon General Feb 29th tweeting face mask use cause issues.

The CDC similarly said masks little nothing. Hell changed policy.

They shamed NYT OpEd section someone outside field.

The idea lie us hoarding lame turned wrong. Masks already flying shelf hospitals said needed received millions masks donations. army people sewing masks old tshirts donating them. 

There little actual evidence stupid public actually started hoarding everything. Shelves went empty actual demand actual supply changed overnight.

But, happen blew trust capital. right plenty people using excuse would used something else public health officals tell us everything.   give link, please? 

Also, low point COVID deaths right now. compare first 6 months normal 6-month deahts? mask still protect bit. RPG terms (with ballpark made numbers)

 WASHINGTON—The Food Drug Administration plans release guidance Tuesday outlining conditions approving Covid-19 vaccine, including requirement vaccine least 50% effective placebo preventing disease.
  FDA said vaccine would approved unless vaccine company “clearly demonstrated” proof vaccine’s safety effectiveness clinical study, according summary guidance viewed Wall Street Journal.
  According summary, FDA also said vaccine wouldn’t approved simply leads antibodies bloodstream patients, grounds known level antibodies confer protection patients.
  FDA said would also require vaccine maker conduct monitoring safety approval recommended people getting vaccine followed year treatment. summary document said “post-market studies” may necessary “further assess known potential serious risks.”
  guidance expected discussed FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn appearance Tuesday Senate committee, holding hearing steps needed get businesses, schools institutions fully reopen.
 Developing vaccine priority Trump administration, dubbed initiative Operation Warp Speed. FDA vowed use available authority expedite safe effective Covid-19 vaccine, fueling hopes preventive treatment developed quickly.
 time, FDA says guidance “will reduce standards cut corners review approve vaccine.”
 FDA sometimes faulted moving quickly campaign prevent treat virus.
 least 160 antibody tests Covid-19 entered U.S. market without previous FDA scrutiny March, agency rushed get public quickly. fire, FDA mandated stricter review.
  agency also granted emergency-use authorization two malaria drugs, chloroquine hydroxychloroquine, Covid-19 treatment, later revoked determining ineffective.
  Guidances method FDA uses state policy industry, case vaccine makers. virus vaccine could granted approval two ways—either full approval emergency authorization. 
  full approval FDA would require vaccine company amass trial data submit details advisory committee outside experts, process typically takes months.
 emergency authorization could happen quickly full FDA approval, would still require vaccine maker show clinical study vaccine produced lower levels disease, according summary viewed Journal.
 Government industry officials concluded standards FDA espousing full approval need least 30,000 people clinical trial. since coronavirus pandemic flared U.S.—including Arizona, Florida Texas—it may well relatively easy companies doctors sign patients eager see participate vaccine study might protect them. tried explain many people subreddit ships terrible places treat covid victims, received well. Follow masters. Two questions:

1) long sanitize N95/KN95's oven temperature?

2) many times sanitize N95's/KN95's use again? even they'll still somehow deny really Covid. Live, New York! CAME YELL THIS! Surely protesters exception, right? It'll protesters Houston, right? I'm getting tired things I've cooking since march. I've tried adding new things helpful, food variety something fill time. Even still great. still go sit restaurant though, absolutely worth risk. brain toast even before, guess got worse... Reminds Mission Accomplished no. Maybe read topic becoming hysterical tourists, truckers anyone else Finns.

Most rest Europe imported virus. knows long T-cells maintain memory make antibodies precautions place since start Covid outbreak. ICU nurses typically exhausted simply jobs. keep fear mongering. Naw say. Every aspect public health political. is. took huge balls shut down. I’m amazed black dude stood pressure whole population good ‘ole boys. women fuck them. taste like crap. can't cook, home meal options tasty, generally. craving good food. And? teachers, they're frontline responders knowingly put lives harms way. already get paid little one of, important job modern society. Every preventable death significant due implications school look like next year long term outlook teacher shortages. It’s abhorrent honestly, correct it’s 100% huge part population conflicted Same. I'm sorry people self centered. much disinformation beginning, shit keeps occurring. instance, parents, early 60s, say worried this. I'm going honest, disinformation continues be, denial. much anymore. wear mask go grocery store, time leave house, unless take kids play backyard. One things really worry live state gets super cold wintertime. may judge actions support cause somehow nullify consequences actions may bring.

I see anyone said that. Frankly, getting equal appropriate rights everyone worth risk additional cases. Obviously limit number cases, honestly find cause important country coronavirus. one isn’t psychopath wants happening. 

The rate death hospitalization different ~15% though (last checked). entire purpose keep rate infections “flat” at-risk people dying park benches waiting line get hospital hallways already lined dead dying. Yes, actually happened Wuhan. Arizona hospitals pushing surge capacity now. hospitals overrun every minor accident becomes life threatening. death rate COVID also go up. 

The death rate kept low keeping infection rate low. Infection rate kept low people following guidelines. Unfortunately people stupid selfish follow guidelines responsible governors shutting down. Nobody wants it, worth it. Death lags behind new cases around 2 weeks. case aware. sure. close friends scattered country unable travel them. specific. really sad time. brother lives near though try hang more. sad. SARS-COV-2 10% fatality rate, one looking g less 1%. anywhere near deadly? I'll vote tazer. Unless politicians also get it... die. That's probably close number we'll see tomorrow weekly pattern holds. mean logical rational person would say contributed surge cases , virus give shit politics. degree contributed , well probably get million different answers different agendas, shit contact tracing US people go whatever feel right aligned political views. Idk. think probably used 1 hospital reference dramatize it. I've seen amounts talking about. 2020 gonna eventually kill human race one way another. It’s around years Nah, thats caused problem. Two packs im good month two. Thats one usually get. Motherfuckers buying entire pallets it. caused problem. hear COVID-19 cause lasting brain damage patients recovered it, maybe that’s play perhaps good piece, I'd attack evolution generally works individual level. Gaia thing good evolutionary biology. aside, think useful start thinking current effects pandemic terms selection...natural selection part. pandemic exerting genetic selection species, previous plagues. person type blood, I'd rather selected against, occurring would like know it. lockdown appear forgotten traffic. I'm going that. need find middle ground. need 8 week hard lockdown get virus levels manage. That's way gets control. think that's economically feasible, going really hate years forcing businesses large chunks economy close positive case. general consumer malaise caused unsafe visit local establishments without potentially getting infectious disease. winning. Trumps still wearing mask. Lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. 90% 6 minutes, amount time reduce initial viral loads quicker African Swine fever h1n1, one is. Nope. Still works. Virus’ decrease morality rate mutate order live longer. virus mutates deadly won’t host live they’ll dead. safety measures.

There wildly different definitions this. add this, majority deaths nursing homes caretakers wary consequences. would issue dedicated covid units. plenty people coming days past positive test. grocery clerk refill drinks? dude McDonald's? Locusts? Locusts? Murder hornets would like word you.

Stop 2020, I'd like get off. True. every alternate administration get office? Trump unique that. 

Just lot vocal. simple word filter exactly testing for?

Nobody - date - proven existence SARS-CoV-2 RNA. proof origin virus genome viral-like particles cellular debris, pure impure, particles kind. words, existence SARS-CoV-2 RNA based faith, fact. 

So testing for? Ewwwww germaphobe’s nightmare. agree, get bedroom! sexy all😅 Anecdotal, talk people, Gen Z, X vs. Boomer. ""every part society"" disconnected - everyone age \~60 vs. younger. Multiple generations pointing single generation calling entitled, selfish asshats. right leaning father said local nurses (in FL) saying Covid patients hospitals tested every single day, inflating numbers. don’t understand hospital would count every day tests, guess makes sense? anyone else heard this? didn’t know enough subject retort “that seems weird though, right?”  peak retardation. Wear mask It’s good idea don’t see it’s legally enforceable. 50% what?

1. 50% reduction mortality. 

2. 50% reduction ventilator use. 

3. 50% lower hospitalisations. 

4. 50% lower symptomatic disease. 

5. 50% fewer patients shedding virus. iterations? whole secret getting good fit. know N95 mask fit right 35% effective? HCP take classes getting good fit. sometimes add tape funny looking gasket contraption.

You might experiment wire and/or different masks. block air escaping top mask. Maybe need larger mask? Bend wire top fit bridge nose perfectly. Get mask high enough nose glasses ride top mask. Hope helps.

Edited add: also try anti fog spray glasses. come limited supply. people adopt time goes nobody gets skeleton liquefied taking Good thing don’t immediate dreams international travel. No, also never made $10k calendar year.

You can't get everywhere wages. fact saying minimum wage $15/hr tells live place high cost living minimum wage $7.25 live. Actually state level like $5 $6 follow federal one. simple thing. Associate ""freedom"" youre good go America that, reddit LITERALLY CAPABLE looking individual cities states looks America whole cykotines risky healthier people treat go home die ICU room you.  want covid patients, way expensive. want juicy spinal surgery patients, lovely tasty ambulatory surgery center. believe living Alabama see lot cars license plates states likely heading Florida beaches they'll carry virus back home areas.  fair, Hillary Clinton administration charge, might've strong sensible federal response week earlier, hysterical hatred Dems general would started refusing follow ""freedom-stealing"" mandates LOT sooner Trump admin. sheep follow chosen one's words matter what, good thing made right call life, bleak picture March would likely happen action taken. Every course (in)action he's made since course well-being people, nation, world. see all. see rise deaths Iran right around two weeks cases picked up, consistent median 12 day period test result death (about 15-16 days symptoms death). said problematic? Godzilla  Fuck, man. swear actual people would come exact conclusion. ☹️ agree rock hard place. protests important, slowing spread virus. area fewer cases mean immune becoming worse. would foolish pretend protests going part that. minimum people need much careful masks social distancing protests. others call totalitarian dictator tries stop spread. end extreme spectrum armchair politicians.  definitely could find 100k daily cases today, tripled testing.

Open 200 testing sites CA, FL, TX, AZ SC we’d hit 100k easy tip grocery clerk?

The dude McDonald's? 

Every one jobs make minimum wage? signaling

That's think happening protests throughout country? Virtue signaling? think could touch tried. Eventually everyone get it. Unless vaccine incoming. Trump Tricked Idaho still nothing. guess governor wanna wait 1000 new cases per day. lost lot respect 2020. makes sense - think that. Thank you! Science would like word. Yes no?... would depend suppose. 

One thing sure, they're good keeping hands mouths covering sneezes like adults are... argue possible risks. Guidelines issued. I'm *not* comfortable experience would leave. Sweden got things wrong pandemic take huge grain salt. would anyone trust CDC competent handle point? shown quite opposite. Flip flopping decisions made virus already. seems like taken credible source anymore.... Guess they’ll bar going  Cases picked May 4th. Deaths picked slightly around 2 weeks later, mostly leveled (as starting US). Early June saw corresponding uptick deaths. American live abroad? still travel? Saskatchewan. yet say “go get tested want.” Tremendous amount virus, whole world. Even China Yeurop together. Apart inflation, still worrying. spread slowing down. restaurants bars can't offer outside serving closed. Right, sunlight exists beach, can, within milliseconds, inactivate virus someone coughs directly you.

Except none said true, expect reality change suit wants needs. takes minutes destroy virus sunlight. going make beach safe know it. Western cultures historically rooted individualism, particularly US, “American Dream” *you* house, picket fence, two cars, etc. Note ultimate goal American Dream personal financial success. religions similarly monotheistic focus individual communication God.

Eastern cultures, hand, typically community-oriented get extreme reverence elders, expectation useful member society, etc. big eastern religions generally polytheistic contain messages interconnected nature life god. (I’m less personally familiar eastern cultures, paraphrasing Joseph Campbell book read years ago).

I think South Korea excellent example nationwide buy-in masks, testing, social distancing. I’ve also heard decent things Vietnamese response. know getting voted - improving AC indeed practical solution here. People need read press release.

You think people actually read articles around here? Headline only, call day. Haha oh man. maybe next they'll ""studie"" telling us whether sky blue... please tell new information ""studie"" gave us. one true king Actually, next step probably evaluate effectiveness using military. American department defence already made preparations necessary vaccinating thousands soldiers personnel. far away China, seriously STOP IT! can’t wear mask, keep distance people, stay home you’re sick years? That’s like bare minimum could ever asked help fellow compatriots can’t even that? Really?  much hazmat suits? Probably around August/September next year. hate got almost whole world, planes ships shut one islands remains uninfected... Interesting note: sounds like still vaccinated 2 participants tested positive study entry.

That's actually pretty important point could vaccinating people already virus without realizing it, actually necessary know safety it. Alaska. test arrival quarantine get results. seems ok far usually seen way around Americans coming Toronto Montreal go Europe save cost. Umm, like silly stuff Musk claiming, made initial fortune series tech. start-ups 1995 2002. included early involvement Zip2 , PayPal, started SpaceX. Daddy decently well-off wealthy. tech. worker bee, genuine chops computer hardware software. rocket science came later mostly hiring listening right experts.  That's definitively true. looking 10-20% rate pneumonia. That's serious health condition. Half Americans raise middle finger. Unfortunately half country ignore advice want Florida woman now. whole speech full irony I’m pretty sure mentality area won’t happen me. see majority people traveling socializing. One person know particular family ton health problems diabetic (very problematic covid) Vegas weekend birthday. people scared enough, know take. Florida nurse. wish people would stop spreading hearsay. 
We test covid positive patients every day.
If retest 2 weeks it’s still positive, count totals. Maybe/maybe not. Depends live. states affordable still find great paying job. Except they've said mask nothing preventing getting holocough, nice, witty, vapid jab small brain npcs gonna eat hope get Rick Fox card shit kills Bad bot *slow claps* Hospital administrators business people. Money goal, period. Sure ones patient care #1 priority, maybe. heard nurses, could give rat's ass that. even allowing nurses bring PPE! Yes. flu vaccine significantly helps flue season 50 percent coronavirus vaccine would significantly help also.  Unless makes feel good sake feeling good I've totally gotten one Christ tips cards looks like $20 First come cases, hospitalisations, deaths. Jesus Christ. people listen wake fuck fact aren’t invincible, virus joke?

I really think run obituaries people died pandemic humanize losses people have—maybe saw people like invincible, might repent wear masks actually listen guidelines.

I’ve heard people previously ignored guidelines, regretted loved one died COVID 19 got (and may hospitalized)...sometimes unfortunately takes reality come slamming door face naïveté people realize isn’t joke. We've never done kind testing flu. might actually know coronavirus flu point.  That's pretty damn good sign. Pretty sure new Zealand open boarders countries control go slow. fully open years vaccine everyone cares others best tell whole truth. I’m sure accurate measure. reason kids less chance getting due going house. Parents keeping kids home following suggestions provided one person leave house limit exposure. yes, 1 3.5 million probably number happens kids house unable keep masks day. really think 5 year going constantly wear mask wash hands? Think again..  Wtf good laugh this, thanks. mental image guy ""snowflakes last long Texas"" tshirt slumped kitchen table dead stress reading back mac cheese trying figure works...

Cell phone limp hand busy signal trying patch last pizza delivery place everyone else shoes trying reach able least eat survive. needs shouted rooftops. Yeah, bit confusing like that. mortality rate might accurate indicator.  Chief executive would get board wear mask sure could sway many citizens wear masks. Fauci back testifying alongside senior officials Senates health committee. Several Republican senators asking please get board wear mask. Hopefully happens. surface transmission never issue Imagine much better we’d people actually listened Fauci best plan ever totally ineffective use it. Someone tell six feet masks give good shot escaping virus though. rate started spiking started reopen indoor locations. still lot know, hard say anything sure, lot evidence suggest spreads lot indoors especially help AC. good part DNA vaccine, different class Oxford, Moderna inactivated vaccines China. classes have, higher chance eventually getting vaccine.

34/36 subjects mounted antibody response, mean antibodies effective, significant number people say immune response. ~~less~~ fewer flu mutates quickly, vaccine try predict strains prevalent. That's case here. There's pretty static target. analysis results, published journal Nature Monday, showed start quarantine, **2.6% Vo’s population - 73 people - positive**. two weeks, 29 people positive. 

To put perspective it. try finding experiment this: get two transparent containers gas thermometers inside. Give one 200ppm 500ppm. Congrats proved CO2 greenhouse gas rising concentrations = higher temps. know could trust people equipment figured decades ago.

Not mention, shit terrain going change much temperature increases. Somewhere near body water see much change. Deserts receive ton thermal radiation reflected right back, likely get hot faster. joke, shared H1N1 experience another thread biggest fear people downplaying one name. recovered, thankfully, one point genuinely sure I'd waking fell asleep night. fever high delerium.

There's already idiot saying Swine Flu issue young, misleading. 20-ish fairly fit. Take care allow people tell one flu. read minor symptoms many didnt. know happens, fact true friends family. smart cost much big picture things :) mentioned they're scattered country. appreciate suggestions place again! Thou shalt put Lord thy God test GOP back corner virus. made political medical issue. lead members dying hurt long term failed response. lost mind long ago. main issues COVID reporting making seem like death around corner anyone without mask

Except one saying that. made argument something exist. information pretty much everyone dangerously stupid folks pretty damned good given knowledge said. would? Seems like everything indoors restricted shut due risk spreading virus, yet schools planning reopen danger. anyone think democracy world would deemed acceptable government current situation? duty care citizens?

The system broken. S&amp;P 3000 Dow 25000 everything fine... next? Tell people drink disinfectant? Oh dang.. mean what's next? Tell people take pool cleaner tabs? Oh shoot mean... next? Tell people shove flashlight lungs? Know what. Never mind. give up. There's lot learn. fuck talking about?

And true Denmark. Low numbers, masks. They're scattered country. I'd fly. necessarily want fly (as necessarily want fly right either). clarified sad last night. Well, considering placebo prevents 0 percent. would assume x number people without vaccine catch covid would expect less x/2 people vaccine catch it, assuming two groups equal number. mean, Trump asked March would happen let wash us.

This clearly strategy. Yea, agree completely. I’m mainly responding idea outside air clears immediately. It’s still miles better indoors viral load seems critical factor disease. specie adjusting surgeries start next week. Please pack bag spare underwear. picked transport division shortly. I'm still appreciative. Even you. 

We need people get vaccines continue observing populations they're safe populations less healthy.

And really appreciate this. flu?

We test unless sick enough go doc. countless carriers likely considered asymptomatic. 

The cold probably like too, phase people. Yeah rule socially distanced tables outdoors. hope restaurant im heading bad. sparsely populated state. still worried. plus would show even considers possibility could get sick, sign weakness. whenever present nobody else gets wear masks spread either. Goldman monopoly lending. doesn't. culture fierce individualists revert rebellious teenager whenever suggestion communal solutions... no, wait 75%-90% level people infected pull collective heads asses!

The scary thing is, now; due abysmal response towards virus, much vulnerable engineered biological attack enemies refusal follow simplest guideline wearing fuckin' mask!

Asia whole recovering much quicker due fact majority people naturally wear masks pre-covid19 they're sick consideration others, americans could give two shits infecting people ""it's ME.""

No, u.s. recover at. all. ***any*** voluntary efforts citizens, none whatsoever...

EDIT: *Wearing masks indoors/in crowds cripple least non-issue wear 24/7 walking street...* live rural Ohio I'm happy he's done compared rubes south. 

On side pretty sure I'm person wearing mask. . Might want get onto CDC correct point, then. Basically virus degrades faster outside dies faster surfaces, that's irrelevant person person transmission. friends scattered around country. specific sad last night. one friend visiting exactly do.  would think large quaran-team. depends. family, would problem. They've pretty careful. dodgy cousins, that's risk. 

honestly, michigan 13,000 confirmed active cases right now. That's 1 800 people. would probably give thumbs up. weekend cabin quarantine. unlikely family it, there, would safe *further* risk. 

Most us taking risk, I'd paying shoppers groceries. Sorry loss. national mega daily doses vitamin mandate could save even more. MDs would financially ruined going tell this. prefer cash flow health life. Holy run-on sentence batman! can't nice things medical advice regarding COVID Trump probably take, anything. Goldman Sachs. Medical Professional. much vaccine going Social distance key, masks tool reduce risks social distancing possible magic shield. there's also issue compliance, since masks effective stop wearer infecting others way around effective depends % people actally wear wear properly We'll, he's given. never tells truth. That's really news Well theory made much difference whether opened not, latinx_ people disproportionately work ""essential"" jobs anyway continued shutdown changed exposure. Maybe always ticking time bomb. I’m sure he’s awful, evil man Hitler build concentration camps start world war kill decent amount people.

All Trump say “don’t bother wearing mask” probably end killing similar number people (both direct infection importantly long-term domino effects healthcare economy).  Stonks ready go keep telling feel like I'll ever actually get chance stop. Simple mandatory compliance. isn’t “rights” issue. 

Whisper Trump wants look “tough” issue order announce prison don’t get it. “strongmen” would do. (I made joke strong man strongman heh..) Cry more. 

If ethical beef Uber, lazy, whiny complainer.  mean fair, preparation different action. aren’t ton people getting shot also CoVID19, that’s certainly driving numbers even included.

What hospitals surging month? hospitals issues getting hit hard past two weeks. likewise areas gotten 50% total cases past two weeks new cases largely younger people moment, that’s certainly going change. name ""anti-science anti-vaccination feelings"": Stupidity. remind people they're typing theory device already everything they're accusing Gates trying microchips. Someday...when president...they see. see. work factory making water bottles. FEMA let us shut unless people infected. even FEMA would let us, still shut down. work Exactly. Abbott failed us continue so. fact is, pun intended, abbot spine. whatever big scary men lots money tell do. 
My final straw, say exactly happy before, said that. cant punish people wearing mask. mean whats tje point giveing mandate can't enforce it, point suggestion. Didnt Trump talk deploying army vaccinate population?

The entire population vaccinated matter weeks netherlands  Roided big bois seem well thing larger weight fat muscle heavy dudes put additional strain lungs heart high BP common blood clotting. There's reason taller heavier people general die younger commonly heart issues cancer such. Since they're young problem though I'm saying getting thing could ruin athletic career life. worth it. anti Vader. I’m fully vaccinated. I’m taking vaccine. Y’all go take rushed vaccine want I’ll take chances corona.  4am virus midnight, we're nto remotely third way. We're one- sixth way. need quit family. masks cheaper ventilators. /thread people tired stress situation. Whether they’re type wear masks not, people become afraid, anxious, depressed can’t work, can’t see friends/family, even go get haircut. think people don’t/can’t cook. I’m sure think able go mask-free (cause muh freedom!) eat don’t wanna cook learn how. It’s them. 

Even though share contempt people won’t wear masks, feeling lot protests efforts reopen they’re lonely, insecure future, acting account it. Like little children. However stress hits us, shapes behavior better worse. updated June 26th lol

So, 15,000 ppl hospitalized Florida coronavirus? “The U.S. become example comes coronavirus.” mean human race whole individual people? I'm understanding mean ""sweet spot."" 

Some people accept death normal part life. largely based experiences. Costumes avoided prevent becoming like Canadian PM. Brown face Arabian night good look him. 😂🤣😂🤣😂 problem can't it. 

The problem lack political it.

There's even enough political mandate masks, way less invasive zero potential negative health side effects. would anyone want go restaurant face mask? pretty much kills enjoyment dining restaurant. food delivered pick eat home *without* face mask? ignores reality everyone lives near relatives impractical people see indefinitely.

That aside, people stay home indefinitely. travel. means didn’t choice anyways sauna use beneficial health “quackery”? mean directly effective covid, yeah, that’s bullshit. tons studies showing benefits saunas. China actually loves Trump.

They're going copy drug hand free/cheap.

Then US complains goes WTO, China go ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, ""sorry, sorry"", ""Yeah stole it, so?"" 

And rest world happily take Chinese knock offs. Colorado flipping. hate Cory Gardner here. Either Romanoff Hickenlooper take seat November (primary tonight!), add count. Silver linings man. Congrats! Keep killin it. Immunosuppression steroids realli!   upset? didn’t think people dying bad thing earlier. Oh wait, *you* matter huh? 5 year old said would nice saved money would go purchasing vaccines. useful talk raw differences confidence intervals broad and/or initial numbers small, see example above. able tell talking raw numbers earlier based context, I'm sure issue now. Wait, unfamiliar CDCs role delaying introduction effective test month? opinion - HHS IG investigation. manage get skin? Injecting energized liquids something? makes little nervous studies regarding blood type... Sweden deaths per million 528
Finland deaths per million 59 How? Already shown supermajority people wore masks 100% time around people, outbreaks would end matter weeks. people would universally mask up, thing would over. effective placebos preventing viruses entering respiratory system? That's usually part typical Triage system, expected survive given ""comfort care"" help keep comfortable till end conditions change get access care. COVID-19 unlike injury type Triage little slow change, ""written off"" likely death sentence.

I feel bad/sad healthcare workers end one's making calls. hard, falls choice category mass casualty event, got even harder choices/decisions made due something totally could avoided/not happen.

Sigh... Yes large top 10 tech firm 2021 sales projected 35% next year Yeah read says drivers given Clorox wipes give passengers passengers disinfect. sure sounds like want save money taking liability (if passenger doesn’t sanitize catch it, it’s fault company’s) making paying customer work instead person paid actually work. 


This ethically unsound exploitative. Old people dying. know. Holy shit good point.... fucked Got infected early March someone pre-symptomatic. get PCR ended antibody test recently. reliable symptoms. temp rise 37.8° noticed monitored myself. days later lacked appetite hours that's all. Normally 38°C fever bed sick. detected change O2% tested oxymeters work thought broken 94-96%.
I know nurses covid+ roommates developed dyspnea test -. 30% tests false negatives. symptomatic test - viral load 3000. also + asymptomatic even weirder. Patients present low oxygen blood gas measurements barely clinical signs suddenly get massively hypoxia need intubated right away. isn’t really happening rest world? Look germany example. Sure masks used stores yet local spikes. great feels like? cømment ønce bit sister add 19, one knows means :) whole situation regarding children clear right now.

It seems, children less likely contract virus compared adults, infect others rate.

But studies. least Germany think lot countries schools kindergarten closed. infant get infection? think may infected, take children testing facilities?

These studies heavily discussed. Dr. Fauci Prof. Dr Drosten lot podcasts topic. hedge hydroxychloroquine play work Would playing NFL season 4 weeks shutting worse never season begin with? described vast majority politicians USA sides political spectrum. That’s biggest issue opinion. Yea, that's sure That's right now... tune might Change post lock down.. “and begins” I'd like see study testing theory looking groups likely get sick see show protective effect like children. Healthcare workers probably due to, know, marinating covid, teachers parents young children might interesting place look. Every time daughter brings something home nursery, catch it. sick *all winter long*. people like better off, too? would interesting know. Yeaaa. reading I’m like “that’s stupid question.”

I didn’t take seriously first tests limited got home, I’m extra cautious, almost paranoid. Isn’t death rate going down? 30 days? Add zero number. vaccine arrives, non mask wearing assholes continue ruin everything. Many drugs treatments available US research profitable enough undertaken all.

There's often news stories someone rare affliction trying get treatment something US socialized healthcare countries cover. Force Mask making good haves. large part population still believes trickle economics makers takers. would surprisingly successful message. would great politicians even acted like people important like cared us. hear people countries paid stay inside safe. Isn’t Goldman Sachs company ripped off? Except Trump political appointees shut truth telling American people. sister anti-vaxx, drives fucking insane. conspiracy theories, mental gymnastics, circular logic infuriating.  rather fair earnestly think America could leader dealing this.

Just trump Yes, I've talked several people like this. seems human nature shut things can't bear handle. saying impossible fake ADA cards working now... Back published June 26th?

You don’t seem understand hospitalization rates.

10% confirmed cases end hospitalized FL. bad headline. state shut down. Twitter different beast since geared toward public discourse. Almost every state shut thing. YouTube told wearing mask pointless sheep /s 

I wish Americans would listen experts area expertise no... know opt right? Like doesn’t feel right one forcing play Depends late game are. He's usually upbeat, lately however, seems exasperated defeated. far.... people wearing masks? live everyone wears masks. rare go grocery store see someone without mask Sorry clarify. blame people coming NJ/ NYC trashing state. people actually isolating victims shitty situation want vaccine due conspiracy theories causes autism Bill Gates blah blah blah. people assholes.

There want take vaccine due speed. fastest vaccine produced 4 years yet one supposed October. kinda see people feel corners may cut.

Look want vaccine soon possible, therw instances vaccines made worse. reason take years need see possible long term side effects vaccine are, any. can't compare numbers like that. 

The first surge happened highly-populated northeast took us surprise wiped hospital capacity quickly. 

The second surge happening lower-populated areas yet hit hospital capacity. number spike so.

Nothing situation changed make virus less lethal. cures found, mutations made friendly. Nothing changed.

You're comparing large infection small area larger infection even larger area. Let's revisit 3 weeks numbers bigger anyone ever seen before. that's exactly get pirated drugs coming China. They're going give drug. Trademark gonna stop them? Yeah right. MINOR League Baseball - subject line read wrong several times wondering discussed baseball reddit. one probably get deleted like last one. Floridadistaster.org know going people, many wear masks, need ventilators, right? It’s it’s relaxing like meditation massage. fact, aren’t even relaxing lol. sauna? don’t feel relaxed inside them, it’s uncomfortable stressing, like exercise. plenty studies show saunas real benefits. 

Sauna use promotes mild hyperthermia, turn, induces wide array beneficial physiological responses. responses reduce oxidative stress inflammation activate cellular defense systems like heat shock proteins. It’s pseudoscience. Well patent might worth paper outside US. sure find companies make People suggesting years misery recovery possible blast one person party sole culprit 

Maybe shouldn’t telling contact tracers able ask someone attended protest. 

We also shouldn’t assume deaths we’ve NY NJ follow, since aren’t putting sick folks elderly homes. TOLD YOU! No. Sleep 2077 good measure. Cyberpunk 2077 surely out. Doom gloom better gloomy reality. 300 cases schools closed.

The current surge cases worry school districts. know several teachers kids return school switch distance learning. Ah, missed “before this”. I’d read well, including smaller rural hospitals closing. Sorry can’t help that. Maybe eating meat. 

Or just, know, cook meat eating - wash hands soap immediately handling raw. honesti dont want senate flip biden wins.  dont trust either party owning three branches. family done well, literally 4 months maybe 6 outings? delivery groceries, visitors, etc. yet today 14 year old started 103 degree fever. idea came from, anywhere around anyone. may COVID something exposed it. Well, Treasury Secretary, multimillionaire, record saying $1200 check sufficient last Americans 10 weeks.

King County entered phase 1 reopening June 5 phase 2 June 25th. Masks help silver bullet completely stopping spread. slows down.

King County also drastically upped testing. Mid-may testing around 1500 people per day. around 3000 per day.

The fact positivity rate shooting reopening great sign county. get 500 ish stops possible people intuitively differentiate two numbers. Like know 1200 1100 different others reference point compare to. 126,000 people ridiculously large number defies normal experience, no-one knows many people still 42 9/11s last 5 months, 8.4 9/11s month. one 9/11 every 3.5 days. paraplegic President years ago, dude.

The deal everybody gets passionate one article read write key points comment section rest us read one article \~100 comments day order stay informed.

Since common knowledge read past headline, first comment almost always headline inaccurate major caveat, meaning headline + first comment generally enough give full picture. daily reminder real government Pentagon. asking sheer ignorance mean mention ending animal agriculture? mean end mass production type farms? really interested things said. Me? White House. respect Trump. respect Fauci. Hey what's pig deal? Yeah agree. know realistically going last forever, science win this. It’s hard knowing long take everything happen between. Ah yes.  ""secret"" trackers absolutely 0 effort put hiding existence work used along side specific apps downloaded installed onto already one best tracking devices known man already willingly carried around majority population. Better safe sorry. Agreed headline horribly written well punishment multiple thousand dollar fine. personally know people cancelling trips vacations due possibility fine seems working way is. need go police state take people's private property. think likely. China pass opportunity play savior. Actually racism still major issue it’s source pain today. Today, pain comes knowing matter hard try lose job upcoming recession. Meanwhile, major corporations receive bailouts mass layoffs major portions employees. jobs return many replaced AI automation. source pain inevitable. see soon enough you’ll know right along... believe anyone saying society ending. handling badly getting many people sick. That’s lot assumptions part OK. like baked beans... i'm skinny think wife kids make fun drinking call ""poop juice,"" jokes them. Omg look everyone edgy edgelord is!!!! ""Several dozen students living fraternity houses north University Washington’s campus tested positive COVID-19 recent Let's hope rest world starts making medicine themselves, gives US finger they'll threaten sue patent breach. Lol yeah perfect world (or South Korea) absolute correct thing.

I would suggest trying send h.s. age kids SK student exchange program possible.  14,580.

And misunderstood stat would put FL 20,580 hospitalizations whole pandemic, tiny portion population infected, surely see goofed. Anyone know Worldometers dashboard consistently slightly higher numbers Texas Dept Heatlh has? secret sauce?  Well...really distrust current administration much party backs them. still high level trust towards many institutions. even trust Jerome Powell Federal Reserve honestly trying best avert complete financial disaster -- think political agenda trying line pockets. Sure unless protestors higher positive test rate non-protestors reason think protests risky far spreading virus goes. wow. sunday Texas got 5700+ one day. Yeah. going personal decision everyone.

I hope vaccine period, opportunity give informed consent. Yes 1-minute mark video.A key points:

* flu talking African Swine fever Europe serval years.
* flu comes China 08/2018, experts believe Russia (see 1:10 mark, that's talking passed Europe). circulating since.

The facts (at least backed sources online).

The things sure whether swine flu mentioned article African swine fever mutation African swine fever. Since African swine fever still around China, reasonable guess linked flu mentioned article. clearly labeled sure part.

Edit: Checked again, article talks H1N1 flu different flu talked about. lot doom gloom here. 75 million kids US guarantee social distancing entire time.

300 kids got this. 300! half million tests per day. deaths fallen steadily. know handle virus better. actually therapeutics prevent deaths. know percentage people many multiples higher originally. expected. expect younger folks ones who’ve gotten it. 

I’m saying there’s uptick. suggest society ending asinine. interesting. really, really helpful, thanks much! Precisely soon New Hampshire starts blow though, blamed Massachusetts license plates people ""seein' everywhere"" need ventilator wear mask reading get started. $8.95 told would be. Yes, again, literally whole world everyone involved lying except Donald Trump. Holy fuck lol pitchfork-wielding villagers modern age. everyone opinion needs platform. lot people already Oof, went head! Next week: clinical trial reveal remdesivir ineffective treating Covid-19.

Week after: Drug producers India ramp production knock-off, sell rest world 80% less charged US.

Year after: Gilead CEO retire, cashed $6.3 billion stock options.

Decades later: Decaying stocks remdesivir retrieved warehouses, repackaged fresh expiration dates, donated less-developed countries huge charitable tax write-offs.

Did miss anything? maybe meditated it, would see grim reality situation.

But I'd willing bet know anyone personally hospitalized even died this. hope haven't, wish anyone. thing don’t like theses “tests” perfect environment use perfect puff air directly zero factors.  Would love see test office large building people moving around hvac systems running.  

I believe could also prove coughing sneezing elbow produces similar result .  

Also coughed sneezed mask becomes saturated moist air results change? 

Testing brand new home made mask vs one worn 30min straight results? curious this.  2016 - 2020 hope timeline. 2024. Looks like come back quickly puts us back danger words: self absorbed borderline racist bar owner pandering alcoholics pandemic. 

Some us much worse positions complaining half much.  Well known every country *Trump Death Panel joins chat.* years misery many 2008 economic crisis, many still recovering that. one already many times worse. mean, basically said first sentence.

In case happens China. H1N1 happened Mexico, suggest, happen anywhere factory farming takes place. get everyone page (compliance wear masks distance,) seems much harder finding vaccine/cure. enough little bit spread kick off.

Nonsense, it’s policies kicked things off. New Zealand far higher percentage foreign born residents 25%, Australia 29%, Switzerland 29%, Canada 20%, Norway Estonia almost Sweden 15% course! remember u feel healthy right now, you’re danger right now! Every government world wants thing gone pouring money vaccines treatments. want world back normal probably us. Things gunna happen sooner rather later. BLM protests started month ago, across many cities many countries. large initial spread infected people would already developed symptoms recovered now. know, sure feel like month, been. safety sports fall. economic decision, like sports decisions right now. typically check phone red lights thanks looking buddy appreciate ;) right, problems wrong inside America right simple cannot easily solved. 90 days even go far, look *anytime* he's spoken. pants microphone standing much physical exertion him.

I think study merit answering important question, even falls short aspect. youth definitely woke. work definitely interested right thing. One thing I've noticing sub reflects national politicization virus. seems people pretty liberal left-leaning, lot comments posts reflect that. I'm far left too, think sad polarized wearing mask is. think necessarily anyone's fault here, thought interesting. You’re welcome. I’ve started “allow” 20 min sub 5-10 min positive site. Don’t over-read stuff. I’ve good life mental health. live northeast (with family Florida) going rabbit hole sub good mental health. don’t think real. Probably troll. Backlash sides b e answer Yet again, lot anger people instead people power actually make equal sacrifice. going say, ""just go ahead cancel US entirely"" leave that. realized plague cancelling people literal manner.... say anything, everything going work out. Ask care people around you. yet that's bridge far some. might call unethical, un-Christian. People concerned protests, didn’t want criticize much important cause. people don’t seem get outdoor spread source cases even crowded environments it’s still rare extensive transmission. wonder partly time year is. Wuhan’s market outdoor superspreading event I’m aware of, back December air cooler could easily allow respiratory transmission.

As rest said, entirely depends *what type* mask wearing. types block particles others.

N95 masks, masks sufficient filters, certainly stop particles.

I feel like people must forget masks exist, assume everyone wearing flimsy one, making comments yours... Twice? time, too. /s

So glad put charge Coronavirus response team. /s actual ventilator shortage reddit hyperbole? Didn’t New York send back something like 100,000? Also hasn’t proven ventilators we’re harm good? I’m admittedly little behind everything TIL I'm one.

(Honestly, sound like fucjing cheapskate can't imagine ever tipping 40%) 94% response human trials. mice mentioned challenged virus directly think everyone getting virus basically plan beginning. remember Angela Merkel telling Germans 40-70% would get virus point. (Maybe would revise downward now, don’t know.) goal, remember it, slow spread avoid overwhelming healthcare capacity, stop spread entirely. don’t think anyone believed realistic possibility, even beginning.

Should give “to hell it” effect? mean, no. adopt reasonable preventive measures long haul. making long-haul sacrifices difficult modern Americans. So...here are.

Edit: word. DYAC. USA eventually falls apart, states secede, we'll end many countries USA instead 50 states. really well well.

Ah yes, often repeated ""common wisdom.""

🙄

Depends kind mask wearing, wearing it, actually.

Chances correct case... I'm super tired hearing little pearls wisdom regurgitated verbatim, they're partly correct. (Or occasionally completely fallacious.)

Besides, misapplying particular gem. said mainly drill people's heads wearing masks, period, why.

It's basically saying ""don't selfish dick-- wear mask everyone else, everyone else it, good too.""

It's meant ""masks never protect coronavirus"" certainly can, right mask properly worn. I’m sure particular people healthy people appear shape actually damage routines. buddy started working (after addict replaced hitting gym) never spoke physical trainers pretty much thing. Dude got hernia, got stress fractures ankles (he became jacked top rarely worked legs), developed heart problems pushing hard never really cardio. looked fantastic, unhealthier stoners hung with.

His doctor said happens way often people realized. Respirators clinically needed fly, cloth procedure masks completely inadequate. Let us hope not. possibility simply mutated rapidly people giving credit became infectious.  last month saying seem mutating much. Wrong. Again. 

 thing exacerbates problem CDCs countries apparently asleep switch covid 19 cases would counted ""flu"" label ""influenza like illness"" (they routinely count ilis flu cases). get wrong, Fauci indubitably demi-god. ability good midst incredibly toxic wasteland nothing less John-the-Baptist, Stranger Strange Land. Sooner later bastards around take head; probably care. done much good life really all.

No normal person worthy enough criticize Fauci--not morals, achievements, ongoing efforts benefit humanity. Certainly not. none changes fact simply right thing do, sorry it. Frankly, hold people know masks protect them. protect others enough. Hell, even considering skeeviest places might charge $12 glass shitty wine, $72 two people alone dine-in experience normal. (Assuming 3 glass preference, common restaurants I've worked) failbook rather sane. Apart fact mother thinks cannot wear dark blue cloth mask black hoodie colors clash. fact we’re even talking influencers facts don’t actually influence peoples’ actions regards global pandemic showcases entirely fucked world right now. Half wants everything ok, half wants giant asteroid come wipe entire disgusting species. forgot create vacinee themselves? everyone specifically told to. That’s thing, tell something it’s guaranteed he’ll opposite realized banned travelers Europe first months ago? Quit acting like ""got us"".  Go back liberal hole want anything. desires...it evolved replicate human cells, all. depends mask. N95 masks absolutely protect wearer. Masks inserts like vacuum cleaner bag liners well too. correct protect outgoing infections via droplets going out. Better pee pants wear pants splatter land skin. 

Even two layered cotton t-shirts rather effective. people would like live lives point operate businesses way did. scared, every right stay home. find those? Yes 100% it’s super sketch mean literally conversation moms husband thinks it’s fake refuses wear mask.

It’s unbelievable honestly feel bad American right 

And mention feel like indoor dining going shut Cali week two rip job time I’m sure afford open back 

This virus blows Yeah...the authorities turned authoritarians It’s disappointing see people toss importance childhood education aside like nothing. suspect comes place privilege, middle upper class kids virtual schooling parents help, poor kids who’s parents work? Pulling kids school year plus could condemn life poverty suffering, guess isn’t subreddit concerned that. straight student tried help class idiot rich parents

Said idiot understand straight student saying

Said idiot fails exam

Said idiot claims straight student screwed blamed

Said idiot's parent proceed reject help help reason kid failed.

Said idiot proceed fail every exam going forward. wife works target, apparently someone tried mask tried put back. promptly kicked out, thankfully. ridiculous. Probably optimal exercises. Like fighter prefers running improve cardio health versus fighting training. yea crossfitters competing crossfit, ask stay healthy probably diff form exercise crossfit That’s really true, interestingly enough. continue maintain good practices state, virus won’t enough starting point go exponential spread mode again.

If someone Florida lands Boston infected, 95% Boston distancing, wearing masks, etc, virus dies quickly, there’s vector. It’s like MacGuyver’d herd immunity. good real thing, it’s working pinch.

It true can’t go full New Zealand here, though, people. need remain guard vaccine. long do, spike remain thing past. That’s exactly crisis personifies though; can’t nice things. everyone followed lockdown month contact tracing/testing we’d back clear. rule breaking selfishness prevents measures working perpetuates problem. Tear citizens going infected.

You clearly understanding virus works. 80 percent people infected asymptomatic everyone else spreadung virus even feel sick.

Im guessing restaurant.  Id campaign bailout money losing indoor seating soon.  Scientists petitions circulating stop indoor setting right now.  hard evidence indoor seating without mask dangerous. 20% me, 80% thee Basically saying many reasons (based real data) make good decisions (basically things USA done, didn’t) careful so. 350 died u.s. today. numbers keep going down. Keep fear mongoring though, bill.

EDIT* keep downvoting doom seeking dweebs. Honestly guy gets nerves. Could media covers doomsday predictions whereas actually also involved something , seems like proclaim fucked understand fine, seem think everywhere else going exact USA, aren’t.

Places antibody tests, know it’s spreading not, abnormal increases places opened restaurants.

Don’t restaurant, nice hard evidence indoor seating without mask dangerous.

Again, nothing hard purely speculation. (and currently done) minimized distancing proper sanitization.

Places restaurants open *WEEKS* abnormal increase cases. explain that, it’s “dangerous”. I’m sure mean then. terms infecting people always “burn out” vaccine. may defining “burn out” differently. develop treatments, may change social habits (to ensure faster dead-end/burn out.) But, either stop infecting don’t. true entire state though. needed country-wide.  Sadly that’s case. Going let one play like that. know first bitching can’t get help everything overrun.  need senators pushing current administration. trying pull memorial day card, is[""crowds memorial day

Seriously, fuck guy. change business model equipment rental personal training only. caught neurological disorders, blood clotting possibility secondary infections, got buried showing antibodies true secondary infections. 1000% fancier masks do. ;) statues country! It’ll help normalize mask wearing times need polite exchanges like one Reddit. Hell, world matter! Italy others helping ""sure still virus weak low viral load can't spread make anyone sick more."" buy shit one single second I'm absolutely certain going come back bite everyone ass time. r/COVID19positive could give large range (20,000 90,000 lets say), protects lawsuit patient still gets answer.

Put law right side require hospitals give estimates, actually force costs down. can't price competition prices declared procedure done. know, rephrased 50-100%. Global unity scares me.  shit. fact ever politicized ridiculous. And? “Californians never endured trauma New Yorkers seeing hospital system get overloaded COVID-19 patients spring.”

I’m NYC suburb disturbing number people STILL don’t take seriously. father went small gathering today, left pretty swiftly people weren’t wearing masks practicing social distancing. memorial service. someone died April infected Covid. honestly feels like screaming void sometimes.  Thank you! I've bro There’s rub, surge ICU beds matter staff. places taking account happens staff start getting sick. part viciousness Italy.

There would lot push back. strongly opposed travel restrictions. “Virtue signaling” phrase used people don’t want make effort shitty human beings.

Also, read article, numbers way off. Thanks mind brought up. 288 great number matter slice dice blame bars opening allowed so, blame trying stay open allowed so? Currently researching this, results inconclusive. require testing  people try rationalize things way makes sense them. initial panic left yet we’re still shitty situation. lot people can’t grasp fact sometimes bad things happen. everything deeper. This. tons reports people feeling better week getting slammed pneumonia days that. hot hell (90+ while).

It’s temperature, it’s people education level. California 1/10th country’s population agreed. ones without masks right, here. shouldn’t asked fever, know it’s technically, really meant, worried. Americans gonna get barrows gloves soon Yeah, no. outright admitting herd immunity strategy failed rather they're saying things like 'we're moving new phase pandemic using Test, Trace, Isolate' going forward. gamble failed looks like they're (thankfully) going towards TTI. lack fortitude.

Last checked one forces patrons go bars. Seems like personal choice. Florida totes adrobz Call crazy, I’m going predict answer no. see every business even 25%, especially bars alcohol serving restaurants, risk permanently shut down, order skirt temporary lockdown. lockdowns extended, country / people actually comply diligent wearing masks. Every country shut minimum 2 months, places 3 months, Ontario Canada still fully opened, American exceptionalism meant masks, re-opening well states. needed weeks, maybe month, better compliance / laws around wearing masks, USA would position Canada Europe today, re-opened, without much surge cases, though eventually expect little bump, maybe even 2nd wave knows, today still looking good.

So USA could right, second time around, shut 3 months, enforce wearing masks, USA join rest developed world again. would help political leaders led example too, *choice-words go here* followers suddenly switch believing masks cool people unpatriotic wear them. would undoubtedly help. There's good reason USA look exactly like Canada today, except shut long enough, enough compliance shut anyways first time, also mask wearing took bizarro world taboo almost feels like. Kill taboo, shut again, right, implement effective test trace. need extended shut downs.

I expect vaccine really works well several years. feel like COVID thing we'll dealing probably 5 years enough population globally vaccinated, first need actually find effective vaccine could never, hopeful many people working it.

School resume safe, children fall back old routines like every summer, they'll catch best can. 

Honestly, even holding kids back one year end world. doubt starting university one year later even necessary would allow everyone catch up. That’s also assuming children potential contagion point

that's true enough. still far many people refusing stay home, wear masks, social distance, we're giving people disaster relief need stay home. we'd handled things better start could reopening schools safely now. make sure stop half-assing response pandemic we've seen drags things even longer makes things worse everyone. BRAVO! 

Way go, doc. gotta keep sayin' penetrate numb skulls minds. possible. small study (I’m sure accurate credible don’t come me) China showing covid earlier drastic reduction antibodies three months, could potentially indicate you’re immune long scientists originally thought. 

This indicator reinfection necessarily sample size small, fact don’t know yet. it’s want hear doesn’t mean it’s true. want censor media don’t like message? I'm travelling anywhere vaccine exists proven safe. Thanks allowing though. lot places open container laws, pointing out.

But heading says we're third teh way through. third way would 8am. exactly damn problem?? freedom wearing face covering impose on? get it. Unless breathing issue, wearing mask isn’t even inconvenience. People dumb want get riled something I'm calling it. rate, mid-to-late September, 1 10 Texans test positive. Best case scenario, end year. I'm finding increasingly hard see way. number COVID19 deaths, anti vax movement willfully malicious scaremongering help anyone.

Mask-wearing derided fearmongering too, recent past. Even now, lot Americans take virus seriously.

Fact is, lot Americans refuse adhere anti-pandemic safety measures nearly impossible customers tell whether employees handled food people. mean ""change place""? want runners drive 45 minutes city go path less people? happens, taught American Revolution school Canada, definitely portrayed bit overreaction colonists.

Moneyyyyyyyyyyyy---- follow logic. Manufacturing would probably bottleneck, actual vaccination. Yeah... shop opened, don’t want lose job. transferred make much larger hourly rate local, tune almost double, get terminated want apply again, would enormous cut. can’t really lay low wait out, dont kind support that.

So many natural experiments going right now. can't put price muh freedoms. guys follow closely, long take get 25k 50k? take around amount time get 100k. fucking close them. Make federal level. lot people ignorant still. Whatever happened debate around antibodies whether person could infected second time? hot topic one point, heard anything either side while.

Second question - test results skewed multiple tests? Surely people test positive getting second test. healthcare workers getting tested every week? hard interpret data many uncontrolled variables. Summer Arizona sounds like hell matter absolutely shortage ventilators. reddit fear mongering. risk running short thing hit peak, prepared like ventilators disappeared done them. imagine theres thousands ventilators around country collecting dust. potential issue could predict mobilizing ventilators areas localized shortages, even think that's likely going issue. grateful young rn 🙏🏼 took one message go ACTING reasonable person trusts vaccines totally crazy anti vax nutter. joke.

The sources quoted aren’t saying there’s proof SARS-COV-2 RNA causes COVID-19. They’re saying 1) PCR test pick dead virus well live, still test positive recover 2) SARS-COV-2 another infection time. 

There fact animal studies showing injecting SARS-COV-2 causes disease consistent human COVID-19 non-human primates (they part drug vaccine testing studies). Idiots sitting home bored af idiot things. it’s joke. Rand Paul “cautioned public trust words top infectious disease professionals, saying: ‘We shouldn’t presume group experts somehow knows what’s best need optimism,’ Well one leisure activity family another one protesting strangers, seems leisure family safer. gonna assume nobody protests carrying virus lol? That's big assumptions man Well good luck him. sucks big time ventilator. read this. feels pressure open back up, get money, taxes flowing country. wants people prepared open up, ready outbreaks deal needed. like America, need balance. shit hits fan, jump ASAP. can't half ass virus. allow fully open manage cases. prepared shut location down.  Possibly said ""better HEPA"" may downvoted... meant high end office buildings use catalytic filtration addition MERV 13-16 filters. quite HEPA terms raw particulate reduction, basically massive oxidizer high intensity UV sanitizer. Combined large particle filtration covered regular filter, effectively sterilizes air. 

A good rule thumb eliminates odors, eliminates viruses - either physical filtration (HEPA - although perfect eliminating odors due small particle size) breakdown organic molecules make virus' protein shell (catalytic filtration). Class-A office space uses something like air filtration eliminates odors improves indoor air quality.

And yes, much easier stick type unit air handler re-architect building allow windows open - use crapton energy maintaining temperature.

Alternatively people may know Class-A office space is. Basically high-end (top 20%) office buildings cater premium tenants. market higher end features - terms appearance building infrastructure (including things like air filtration). office space things like schools types system probably use standard MERV 7-13 filter stop virus particles additional filtration. study posted somewhere yesterday economist math. concluded adequate testing everyone would cost $7Bn, apparently spent $8Trillion propping economy. 

I’m neither economist president, feel qualified say orange chuckle fuck can’t see past end nose. could seen coming? wish scientists would said something early on. together. I’m sometimes still surprised amount people forum, albeit small, come assholes. add nothing conversation, offer support uncertain time. consider people children purposes virus prevention? 8? 10? 16? think it’s even irresponsible try cash vaccine don’t even know successful whether even treat proper strain virus considering changes next years. Sweden’s plan long term plans lockdowns aren’t feasible span 2-5 years likely dealing virus. need mask mandates social distancing guidelines enforceable still allowing businesses survive. long term plan society could literally collapse span years. I’ve also heard lot circumstantial evidence stating staying home contracting virus keeps symptoms *super* manageable! That’s shitty ass argument considering CDC says website masks prevent catching covid slightly lower chances spreading already it. Bunch goddamn morons According data, case count 14-day trend +159%. That's 4th worst list. Worse Texas. Americans fucking stupid. Always acting like child. sense reason. Wouldnt surprise see US going drain don’t get joke😕 That's kind shit standard consider much know prepped last 100 hundred years. 

&amp;#x200B;

You say world done OK forget part completely fell ass trying contain initial spread became pandemic. Tax brackets. Look up. problem is, arrested. Riverside county sheriff already come said enforce mask policy thinks ""hype"" around coronavirus false. sad. look data Italy vast majority deaths people 60. 86 people 40 died COVID-19. looks like age PLUS overall health determining let precise then. wish could move undiscovered island family ban travel endless supply groceries.

edit: btw i’m kidding. It’s hard time living pandemic anxiety. boss borderline fuming announced wouldn’t going back office next year. sooooo done kids. doubt she’d send kids back school, even guaranteed get it. assholes going infect assholes eventually infect considerate people. could wrong think lot spikes due areas opening little restrictions place (or restrictions without enforcement). advocating here. Bruh😭 gotta chill joke science showing general public use n95 masks effective surgical masks?

I’m concerned real use, people use properly uncomfortable used properly either increase mask-on-chin syndrome worst waste PPE best.

I’m definitely proponent using surgical masks everywhere though. I'm essential worker people bother all.

99.3.% America diagnosed Covid

CDC says 99.6% get survive.

It be, point stressing things cannot control anyone say enforced show?  lived one traffic light COUNTY lol. honestly blast couple summers since gorgeous, live permanently. outside patio bars without many people? Thanks correction. Fixed Instead typing whole bullet list point reality actually anything provide false sense security make annoying breathe talk. Wow  Well ain't fucking taking that! number total tests really small compared prior data points. saying looking good, upward trend, particular data point looks suspicious. Unless go police station wearing mask cough/sneeze...

The police minimum enforce trespass citations customers fail wear mask won’t leave store.

I’d also wish unions would put pressure grocery stores strictly mandate wearing workers strike.

That definitely happening.

I appreciate first-hand experience - recognize hit hard covid end hospital, often far worse flu them. hope understanding virus improves treatments them.

My contentions comparability flu center IFR tells us dangerous isn't. say ""the entire country susceptible"", may true - [up 80% may serve flatten curve, *lengthens* curve. end virus. places hospital capacity becomes problem, argue may appropriate. places like nursing homes 100% appropriate. Everywhere else, harmful delaying herd immunity. lower death rate likely due improvements treatment, that's entire story lasting health complications somewhat common too. Lovely. Maybe sleep 2022. I'll skip 2021 good measure.  Basically we're seeing slow rolling cloud death. mid heat summer sun. Summer slowin' crap down.

But even article, indirect link person question seems contracted protests since symptoms next day friends (people presumably contact outside protests) subsequently tested positive.

Still come intensity protest/COVID correlation think. Mu answer would well See public First world problems. think options heard immunity vaccine.

And probability vaccine within year super long shot, something never done ever before?

We can't shelter place forever waiting possible cure may never come, right?

I know go another year sheltering place without monetary govt assistance people businesses. 

It seem like govt leaders made choice heard immunity one coming saying it. think impossible lockdown again.

Its almost like masks work crowded area Oh, mean like 2008 economic downturn? Pence finally wearing mask 🎤 drop🙌 Ah yes, Riverside County: Florida Los Angeles metro. We’re shining example do. mean considered well it’s two weeks since none still gotten sick. Replace ""Fears"" ""Evidence"" actually story worth posting here. Also, don’t elect Rob Ford prime minister. Yes, know he’s dead. still wouldn’t advise it. Would've nice, even planning giving whole ""social distancing"" thing 4 months, least spend time preparing testing hospital capacity coming surge. 

but nope. guess even shown small level competency.  Beer prisons

Love it. stealing phrase. slower decline everywhere else Europe. Jeesh thought said Major League Baseball mini heart attack. Small person living small world. Well, think costs billions dollars development FDA trialing.  make good points, especially knowing people got sick wouldnt change number confirmed cases. scientists contact tracers looking this. far hasn’t much effect noted.

...”as think we've seen protests, relative lack increased cases occurring, despite crowds, close nature involvement, etc, points importance air, case outdoor air, likely dissipated risk dissipating virus. Spreading like wildfire unfortunate term fire season start part NorCal. Pandemic + evacuated + power shut offs = Bad news bears... Part probably lag, part probably longer mostly nursing home issue younger people getting it, less likely die. Even then, matter if/when ventilators get saturated, I'd say within 4 weeks there's likely going spike deaths. Money..... :/ county 1900 cases last month 5900 month. Still, people going wearing masks. actively ignorant point. Won’t them

Oh friend, ignorance bliss. huge drop pollution  It’s lot easier stay fit worry Coronavirus Would love see test office large building people moving around hvac systems running.

YouTube plenty videos simulating droplets travel sneeze.

And [here's showing Covid spread via apartment HVAC theoretically possible unlikely. Droplets get filtered diluted reaching another apartment. give hope. definitely conspiracy-like. However, even though government create spread virus, heard primarily killing old people (who Social Security), poor people (more likely welfare Medicaid) minorities (uhm...)? 

They hear instead hearing ""Hey, big disease contain!"" think ""hey, people die, social nets money (relatively speaking) cut programs give *more* tax cuts wealthy?!""

FYI, CARES act give tax cut wealthy. Well, I’m thinking almost get I’ve bed fever fatigue 26 hours. Pretty sure us expect happen us soon.

So, like regular flu season, could say. sounds lovely. I’ve checking patio situations nearby - look really crowded &amp; low mask usage also seem things spaced quite well. planning try 
the patio favorite pizza place last week got rained out. I’m looking forward trying one weekend. Well - maybe July 4th weekend. holiday. Loss contact reality. think least 3 - missed two Governors ""And mentioned us, ratings tremendous, fantastic, everybody's talking it!"" Data proved causation spread. Descriptive statistics scientific experiments. I’m flying there’s vaccine, I’ll happily drive 21 hours Delaware socially distanced version family’s yearly beach trip means avoiding sealed COVID tube.

(I plan packing snacks, water coffee advance, miss fast food stops service plazas though) Must sort Trump Propaganda account posting this. Protests probably increase infections way caused massive spike big Northern cities like Philly NY.  estimate one full treatment takes 6 viles 1.5 million doses save 250,000 people most. people going die $3200 price tag. Everything else irrelevant  individualism breeding folks can’t think what’s good collective. It’s frustrating. Sorry, no, true - global pandemic hurt many people. physically economically. 

Tourist areas getting absolutely hammered. Hawaii, example decimated. Vegas Nevada general going get extra hurt. I'm surprised answer question called home beginning this. Super. Chinese movie purchasing generics India. Could quantify difference risk me? Michigan required seated table. words, entering leaving restaurant visiting restroom. asshats refuse even that. Like five fucking minutes much ask you. like they're talking shutting huge swaths businesses anything drastic though case could made I'd think.

Masks bare minimum measures agreed public health agencies make difference.

I hope upped budget medical care centers recruiting training medical personnel. Could say vaccines health coverage automatically put back line. Nature eliminate time. quite, supply limit, US demand skyrocketing along infection rate. testing cannot increase, tests rationed, confirmed cases confirmed deaths lag actual cases deaths. 

Politically looks better little while, artificially suppresses numbers. However, incressed undetected spread worse long run. even surprised..? video shows sort mentality against. make shit up! hilarious...but also disturbing. I'm US, think biggest threat face Corona. goal ease people's unnecessary panic help get country back normal soon possible. overblown response destroying businesses lives. Every single hospital I've almost entirely empty, I've seen lot. rural areas we've going lately, people scared death virus seeing practically zero patients. I'm concerned hospitals going go quite frankly, trust me, much worse long run. also found update news report full hospital beds you. place empty, much doubted first heard news. Turns right. Depends vaccine.

5 candidates manufactured testing. Hundreds millions doses slated available December applaud Norwegian military helping Corona issues well? double standards. he's looking 4,500 American deaths Iraq war. 

We're 129K Corona. I'm trying escape God, trying escape lady. LOL took 3 months Better remain silent thought fool speak remove doubt. agree that. restaurant worker mindblowing many people given trying they're tired inconvenience. I'm pretty sure one doctor constitute consensus ""health experts."" might technically correct he's medical professional, that's useful source itself. find least one doctor support claim regardless merit. California blue overall, red areas well. Remember state huge, metropolitan areas well farm/rural areas. words come mind *holy fuck*. worry then, 15 years herd immunity. Imagine Debt GDP ratio holy shit Honestly yes. legit asked felt symptoms felt comfortable going back work. work public told I'll take quarantine. Alot people can't afford I'm unfortunately. Way deflect shit tier non-argument instead confront fact either lying idea talking agree 100% this. going local burger chain (Habit Burger) free burger coupon. Unfortunately, way redeem order inside, online ordering coupon code entry. 

I saw maybe half tables inside people eating, yeah, stagnant air people taking masks terrible idea virus spreads via respiratory droplets. 

I feel bad chain restaurant workers need put shit management one opened dining rooms. lot people like outraged things, couldn’t outraged protests potentially spreading virus would make look “racist”. 

I agree protests necessary sending message. Plus risk spread outside extremely minimal. people going defend protests say “the protests won’t cause spike” logically say outside 4th July celebrations. 

But won’t....because people want angry spread fear. Get rice cooker frozen orange chicken. add rice+water machine &amp; push button. Reheat chicken stove (or microwave, precooked chicken). Microwave frozen peas. Ta-da. Low effort, especially multiple people. grim prediction 300k deaths probably closer truth would like believe. many states messing numbers misreporting cause deaths. Texas, instance, suspiciously low COVID mortality rate. guess what, pneumonia deaths all-time high.  Sadly, attitude present even healthcare situations (from families). pre-COVID times. People demanding unkind, gets worse fraught circumstances. kidding.  Yes, deaths trail testing positive. it’s restricted hard timeline 2 weeks. Depending availability ventilators hospital beds, death take much longer shorter times. keep watching death rate mid late July you’ll likely see you’re looking for. mean COVID barely killed fraction Spanish Flu's casualties.overall world done ok 100% agreed! I'm going honest thought going even higher. Still concerning though. odds vaccine hitting market significant risk death zero. much higher probability dying virus, even isolation, vaccine. 

And bother mention information before, bunch fearmongering trusting government pharmaceutical industry. kind FUD spreads. people start thinking way, vaccine acceptance slow, pandemic continues, people die. paranoid nearly impossible side effect, care. Ahem.. 'Yeah, help needy. No, sir! needy *enough* please wait non-existent turn. Thank you.' Even necessarily problem... could infected started vaccine built full effect.

 also could vaccine helped protect mild/low level positive and/or asymptomatic. Again, need details. know get somewhere else? 

This also lot focus given expanding contact tracing US. useful know people got infected, knowing quarantine. don’t sympathize people want pity jobs chose. don’t like job quit. fear mongering isn’t strengthening point.

I couldn’t imagine nurse vocabulary work hospital. It’s around six months it’s probably little early “long term” survivor study. end? summer plans screwed think need cancel Christmas plans too. Optimism virtue times like this, realism is. I'm saying shirt example applicable shirts masks different.

No shirts, service polarized means people using example speech.

And someone enforce mask mandate, mandate. strongly worded sign strongly encouraged suggestion.

Enforcement crucial also creating really hostile physically violent interactions. [A NYT survey showed 70% epidemiologists would send kids school now, later summer, Hmm good know. link article chance? don’t even want think bad would suspect lot will, yes.  They’re required anywhere public transport. Mask usage said. stay strong. guys hit peak eventually. question becomes &amp; bad be? may optimism, feel like eventually able beat virus without vaccine. problem cat bag masks personal protective effect almost nothing. People rightfully know they're well protected everyone else wearing one vice versa. Could general virus awareness quell early.. hopefuly Schools need atleast something person, children hurt super bad dont reopen, kids 0 social interaction peers since March. noise I've hearing challenger really nothing? protect dysentery? they're\* Keep trollin' new user. missing fundamental point - *Particle purification essential pre-requisite proving existence virus, thus prove RNA particle question comes new virus.*

It matter fuck many articles produced since January. ***This never done.*** means RNA tested could come number sources, bacterial infection co-infection viruses.

So, even detect RNA, zero certainty 2019-nCoV causative agent clinical symptoms.

This hugely important “positive” result serious consequences patients, non-viral factors excluded diagnosis patients treated highly toxic drugs invasive intubations. Especially elderly people patients pre-existing conditions treatment fatal, already seen. look Riverside County facebook page. There's frightening number people complaining loudly masks, conspiracy, blah, blah, etc. 

I heard state putting measures place return school. guess we'll watch Idaho. state wear mask, students school time, bus transportation limited.

It's true countries cancel schools normally would part. intervention, right.

The American Academy Pediatrics came interesting position analyzing current worldwide data. really bad news Texas, Florida, Arizona, states surging. Right PA, total amount Covid-19 hospitalizations 600. states nearly matching number new hospitalizations day.

lmao irony coming someone anything talking head tells they're easily manipulated fear anecdotal answer question. serious.  also connected change treatments since first weeks - widely known putting someone ventulator right away best course Sweden (unlike countries) ICU means bed ventilator. Older patients still admitted treated since saw April 80+ average 20% survival rate (and ones judged strong enough ICU) ventilator care, switched methods less invasive oxygenation others. doctors also commenting higher proportion elderly deaths many cases fragile dying already virus first stage disease symptoms serious would alarming enough considered hospitalization. understand this, virus health safety others health safety: virus stops spreading, probably get it.

We always remind huge mistake made.

I'm forgiving them. actual document. Tear gas also effective method prevent people coughing guts out. still even say that, even though despise stupid people.

Nobody deserves except maybe shitty policymakers allowed happen. FYI ""a European"" even though Europe starts vowel, consonant sound (""Yoorup""), sound next word dictates use ""a"" ""an"" article.

So I'll admit I'm investing much time studying Denmark made comment initial response. since ramped testing contact tracing considerably lead better control situation U.S. Plus mentioned, cultural compliance goes LONG point I'm driving home Denmark's success imply masks unnecessary U.S. false correlation, dangerous one, stop promoting it. one Volvo.

That’s crazy me. Wow OMG. spine. 

Where spine before, America needed it! Third reason, advises governments encourage use non-medical fabric masks, act barrier prevent spread virus wearer others many cases COVID-19, people general public physical distancing least 1 metre possible - as, public transport, shops confined crowded environments.

Sounds like recommendation. only... read title comma ""U.S."". Poster reading without. What's Florida's excuse half tests? Could tactic woman fired Department Health warning / saying would do? would thought would something far less blatant... Errryup. Wrote backwards. Santa Clara County checking in. Please save us ourselves. hahahahaha... ah, americans - love, Australia Sick. Literally. Dude. no..  Anyone stats AGE people tested? suspect tests early states limited older folk, tests may broadly used. earlier, saw 7,000 confirmed cases we'd expect trailing number deaths close 700 more. today we're seeing low numbers deaths that's accounting least 10 days trailing. DC 781 deaths per million residents. California 151 deaths per million.

AZ - 218
FL - 160
TX - 84

As see 781 actually 4 states combined. 

So get here. Bye. made mistake.

The turnaround quite fast. took test 5pm Friday got results 9am next day. get test you’re curious. went urgent care couple years ago, gave option paying cash insurance, cash option less expensive. need bring forward needed most. could game changer COVID units hospitals! sense duty astounding. knows he's adult room leaves that's it, show's over.  got shit end stick, worked food service 3 months (krystal) US. even everyone taking pandemic seriously, manager/owner didnt wear masks, enforce it, one coworker 10 wore mask. plexi register, dining open. days would 20-30 people small area, maybe half customers wearing masks. First job never felt comfortable voicing up. 

Last day tuesday, willl b glad there. believe feds already stated COVID valid reason refugee status. forgot /s. mostly making fun lot big companies got bailouts. Maybe I've overinterpreted, think so. goes: anecdotal certainly worth looking into. trouble is, government never release stats many people sought denied testing. even talking this? like seat belts condoms politicized. ""It's mAh God given right wear one!""  Californians please stay home? roads Oregon completely full California tourists right now! never end :( say shit like without providing source least. find anything Google seems like made up, correct otherwise. businessinsider may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes. right call idiots wanting pack bars salons pandemic. Every weekend there’s new play YouTube channel called “The Shows Must Go On”. hate admit I’ve fallen asleep weeks turned fun. Anyone know find covid personal experience stories show family? STILL doubting severity virus. economy can't operate way, people bills pay government clearly want help with. losers shutdown outcome lower/working class. Jesus Christ. might well write one single story change names city time. Bars open, stupid, selfish people come droves. Full stop. Well apparently people see false claim regularly wherever go Reddit. I'm disparaging people know commenting incorrect information. 

**All need know: wear damn masks people**, easy they're literally free capable enough search out. see people giving masks away streets protests time. Shitcanery! word year! home maybe. Gyms shouldn’t open all. Seriously. *every* good reason make logical inferences erring heavily towards caution virtually downside, there's entirely much hand-waving ""waiting data"" everything turns shit.

First ""we know certain masks work."" know enough respiratory diseases general logically conclude likely nonzero effect, there's reason wear them.

Then ""we know sure airborne."" there's chance is, assume prevent scenarios airborne transmission aerosols occur.

We can't shove thumbs asses time like ""wait data."" say, perfect enemy good. *have* enough data that's good enough act upon precautionary measures, default mode operation: assume worst, act case ease gather data support it. Got freeze mean 55+ y/o white male demographic? Yeah, forgot source poll published yesterday 30ish percent responses said vaccinated. *fuck* wrong people? culture misinformation conspiracy exasperated fucking social media (I'm looking Facebook) going fuck us over.

Edit: polls conducted CNN Wapo, found 30 percent would get vaccine coronavirus :(  Woah massive deja-vu reading comment. Cause always going guy, never going happen - does... reached height narcissism. Oh, I'm debating First Amendment shall make law respecting establishment religion, prohibiting free exercise thereof; abridging freedom speech, press, right people peaceably assemble, petition Government redress grievances.

I failed see protects private company consequences maliciously telling lies viewers effort advance political agenda. Since runs counterintuitive CDC's agenda protecting public health ( remember Coronavirus HOAX! story? ) would thought might slightly, teensy tiny bit morally wrong. Especially since directly correlate misinformation deaths. That's insane hear, would've imagined New York one last places opening back result situation.

I work bartender Finland we've open weeks limitations regarding opening hours &amp; # customers, masks gloves seen.
You catch serving drinks states million bucks right though. matter precautions. China uses lockdown effectively trace, test, identify isolate cases. take 18, shake tree there's nothing left, get back zero reopen. ever heard murphy's law? ""what go wrong go wrong"" need turn tide going happen November. survive then.

(Not POTUS/VP, members party Senate state level well) miss 2014, really wasn’t bad saw camera. Instagram LIFE duhhh This. Restaurants, bars, gyms need closed. Full stop. Doesn’t matter live kind “numbers” region experiencing. *The cases dropping. Time abandon precautions return business usual. Surely make prior containment efforts worthless. here. like mind fireworks all. said, ain't trying start things either. definitely agree sentiment keeping people sliding down. 100% heart everything society. 

I see prop extreme housing markets without something help get little closer rest country is. Ya know? feel like letting MUCH larger portion work force work remotely would good start. beautiful country lot great places live.. people jobs there. Missouri like that. 

This whole thing mess... maybe I'm pessimistic.. see ending good us middle class people. :( would direct every person stack masks regardless asked for. You’d putting people risk voluntarily accepted risk, see point Chicago two weeks following NYC arc slammed everything shut. Hospitals never hit capacity treading water weeks hospitalizations piled up. never rationing care ""soft coding"" NYC sense. Never based numbers CFR way low that. protect vulnerable system keep economy functioning? must total lockdown not? middle ground? 2020. better. virus threat yes and. cared for. far greater threat lockdown literally everybody. problem. There's nothing wrong inequality. went Best Buy early buy Switch lockdown already really good precautions, employees running around wiping everything down. went back last week go inside store, let parking lot pickup bring you. funny, past month I've heard similar things people normally buy conspiracies, Professionals medicine etc - couple stated virus ""perfect"" way spreads effect people. People getting pretty fatigued whole thing knows. Thats real shock honestly sure it. paper linked r/China_Flu source clicked 6 links source page none opened. know wasted time reading this. sure sounds like doesn’t it? rock prevents lion attacks interested. president would better. Trump net negative. February. It’s relevant now. cases even known US. Depends: positive coworker building Y: sure, coworker X positive: no. keep saying they'll deny right point dead bodies streets.

Then they'll blame dead bodies left. first poes.  Give hopes up? wanting fucking country closed again? can’t handle again. know Reddit swears corona worse thing ever economy takes another hit like March April might GG. believe economy collapses good way serious issues worry about. hoping country close pretty fucked also America full fat, clogged arteries heart disease diabetics?

Because hate China much see ideal weight Chinese people TV automatically react gorging fast food? guy killed people masks singular solution unfortunately Apparently it’s mostly rally speech that’s moved. real behind scenes meetings still Charlotte, per contracts. yet I'm AZ idiots. soon stop going scientists news politics.  So, bad enough people friends Governor pulling side.

I'm guessing hospitals told what's store them.

My hospital rumored conversation Florida gov soon. say /s laws Reddit means 100% serious since thing blatantly obvious sarcasm. Yes asked irreverent question riddled passive aggression? reason? Get sun brah. hate either way. Schools open Europe seen major spikes it. Here’s example going side pediatricians here, aren’t going listen listen to? June 16, Beijing re-closed schools. would schools source Corona spread?

Every country EU seem reopened schools extraordinary low Corona cases so, Sweden adding dozen new infections day - they'd eradicated virus *entire country* reopening schools.

Here America, we're not-eradicating virus, we're outright festering it. Individual states hundreds times infected EU countries - we're still First Wave. know gym must mean lot you. sorry taken away you. Even worse living situation allow many options. 

The thing offer surely imagination come with....something. mention hate running...well maybe time make peace it. resistance bands? Sure squat rack...but...its something. Spartans power rack...be like Spartan. 

Most importantly though try keep perspective. temporary. temporary permanent respiratory damage. risk permanent deficit unknown long term complications contract now. think lockdown sucks now, think life would fundamentally change negative outcome. 

Hope find alternative mean time. bizarre reality   Bill already spent $40 billion money make world better place. privileged group lives US people really truly poor starving. can't even afford $5 life saving medicine. Best wishes mother man, hope makes through. literally USA needs worry this, fortunately rest developed world indoor restaurants. think we're quite yet Canada (not Ontario least), got patio dining week ago, we'll get cases stay low been.

Trump / USA policymakers really failed this, health perspective (obviously) also economic perspective big time. I've said start, best thing country economy medium long-term tackle crisis extremely hard start, re-open slowly cautiously, re-open keep numbers low effective test trace. impatience short-term outlooked (re-election everything else) get economy back running, along mainly right leaning states thinking exempt coronavirus also moved even quicker Trump wanted, completely screwed US economy years come, whilst life almost back normal Canada, low case numbers. Windsor-Essex County Peel Region Jesus take wheel! article LA Health Dept states run hospital beds county 2-3 weeks don’t take action based current hospitalization trends aren’t getting better. zero hard data support observations. It’s speculation point. people right registers didn’t get infected, also wrong lot things virus before.

Blame citizens going infected. every place USA opening restaurants countries seen abnormal rise cases. That’s hard data, unlike speculation traveling AC units.

So despite think, absolutely done safely, absolutely done safely lot places still active cases. last comment got removed....anyway say wish said March. world bigger city US - look comment below. 

Correct data extremely crucial academics govt. (I one) project towards corrective action provide evidence people power force take drastic preventive actions. Without correct data, enough evidence move corrupt powerful bureaucracy. Depending locality essential workers strong emphasis work home. Tucson, complicated pretty large employers Amazon Raytheon well University Arizona (which shut mid-spring break, facilitate return thousands students.) 

March also still predominantly heavy snow-bird season, lots people planned leave April ended staying May 1 (there also people coming 'shelter place' CA NY hotspots early-mid March clear AZ safer comfortable.) course one weird thing doctors hate?

I'll bet is. booked hotel Guatemala offered Millenial discount. clicked discount offer, said must 30 day check in.

Still trying figure numbers?

It’s cool, even easy math challenge people.

Take time, perhaps tone smugness bit going forward.

Just pro tip. Native Texan here. ignorant. greedy. think /u/Varolyn right. agree it, lived lower populace state homes much wider spread could kinda see people letting guard down, thinking big cities affected. now, think there's excuse. afraid getting arrested I'd whip dick everyone wearing mask ask bother you? Cause one uncomfortable, might kill someone. sadly I'm well endowed enough me. 🙃 many countries struggling virus much US. yesterday's news places. makes sense posts about. Trump (admittedly fantasy Trump) come April saying “we’re together, let’s protect other, let’s wear masks public” proceed wear mask himself, don’t think you’d see bullshit see today, might even way mess.

At point, even Trump’s advisors told chance winning re-election, even heeded words actually it, think it’s late, nut jobs would say got Trump, he’s saying political reasons. one months homie ""This global pandemic threatening world. know much currently currently know may change learn more. now, wear masks, keep distance, wash hands, limit going public buildings necessary trips. soon know more, bring date, then, together help can""   people sacrifice safety protect least prolong livelihood, keep food table families.

I would argue society people choose feeding families health unjust society.

But PM relate plight unusual. PrOtESts! This. Also gonna tell huge groups people getting tear gassed pepper sprayed forces cough shit ton wouldn’t spread virus all???

Edit: even remember doctors saying protests making virus worse obviously everyone following protocol specific terms think ""Situation gotten worst"" seems like good enough reason mandates. U.S. actually stand today terms testing capacity? Nobody talks much anymore. Testing top strategy currently wanted be, shutting stuff down. Yet communication get tested nowhere found. Money going mass testing symptomatic asymptomatic, towards relief packages. poor poor man's ignition award 🔥 Thankfully (yet) know anyone died it, know people relatives died it. all, most, three degrees separation Covid death. Thanks letting us know, hopefully help folks find way test. brother get tested couple times Michigan early lockdown early mid april. lose hope, testing must expand absolutely will. This'll become something check every days, new sites created resources supply chain improve. actually bothers conservatives. would seem obvious result disagrees would correct. Except darn pesky facts.  keep getting way narrative proving people like liars.  like orange idol. US shitty country, good enough stay make money. Got it. Yeah, good. OK. going come point people begin flee country. Counter argument. People putting emphasis change. That's I'm confused

Using example:

You always 3 roaches checking rocks, see number known roaches triple. news says ""roaches rise"" two roaches yesterday.

What I'm getting is, increase testing results increase reported cases reported simply increase new cases despite knowing long people ill point still stands. People thought going back May look us lol full lockdown forever people's ignorance political corruption, continue mini lockdowns next year unless everyone cleans acts. perfectly legal state Texas require masks. States wide authority deal pandemics. forcibly quarantine people. completely see angle still think comes let everyone risk want to.

They putting everyone else risk.

Then leaves awkwardly prepare next mask rally? first time months, state officials Tuesday reported zero new deaths Massachusetts due deadly coronavirus pandemic, encouraging sign stood stark contrast states nationwide seen recent spikes numbers.

The Department Public Health also said decreasing official total coronavirus deaths state due “ongoing data cleaning identifies removes duplicate reports.” Monday, running tally confirmed probable deaths 8,095; number dropped 8,054 Tuesday.

A state official said startling decline daily death count zero unrelated data cleanup.



The first Massachusetts death due coronavirus was reported on Friday, March 20.


The number deaths announced, reflects number reported state 10 a.m. day, swing dramatically day day. Friday, number 50, Saturday 28, Sunday 19, Monday 35.

And although metric might appear uplifting, officials warned residents let guard virus — especially state heads July 4th weekend. news conference earlier Tuesday, Governor Charlie Baker urged people continue wearing face coverings, washing hands, practice social distancing.

“We want take one step forward two steps back keep climbing horrific pandemic,” Baker said.

Meanwhile, state also reported 114 new coronavirus cases — 73 confirmed 41 probable — Massachusetts, bringing total tally 108,882.
The state also reported 5,813 new individuals given coronavirus test, bringing total number individuals tested 842,960. total number molecular tests administered rose 1,066,060.



The state also reported new antibody tests completed 918 people, bringing total 71,686.

Meanwhile, four key metrics state monitoring determine pace reopening fell, according Tuesday’s report.

The seven-day weighted average positive test rates decreased slightly 1.9 percent Sunday 1.8 percent Monday. dropped 94 percent since April 15.



The three-day average number patients hospitalized coronavirus also fell slightly Monday 748, 760 day earlier. dropped 79 percent since April 15.



The number hospitals using surge capacity also dropped one Monday. number high 20 early May, seen 95 percent decrease since April 15.

A fourth metric, three-day average confirmed COVID-19 deaths date fatality — rather date reported — also fell slightly, 18 Friday 16 Saturday. dropped 89 percent since April 15.



Earlier Tuesday, Baker touted state’s performance numbers reported Monday, particularly metrics monitored reopening, announced was relaxing travel rules for people visiting state seven nearby states.
“Our public health information continues show downward trend key metrics,” Baker said. “This obviously represents solid progress head July, continue influence move next phases reopening Commonwealth.”



However, warned “COVID-19 taking summer vacation,” pointed states seen alarming spike numbers recently.

“As we’ve seen, several states seeing sharp increases new cases hospitalizations, real reminder us contagious virus be,” said.

Indeed, states like Florida, Arizona, Texas, California either paused walked back reopening measures, closing clamping bars, shutting beaches, rolling back restaurant capacity, among measures.



With newly reported infections running around 40,000 day United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, nation’s top infectious-disease expert, warned Tuesday number could rocket to 100,000 Americans don’t start following public health recommendations.
“Clearly, total control right now,” Fauci said testimony Senate hearing focused reopening, citing recent news clips showed people congregating crowds, often without masks. “We’re going continue lot trouble there’s going lot hurt stop.”
While drop number announced deaths Massachusetts encouraging, models suggest still heartbreak ahead. University Massachusetts released Tuesday model estimated coronavirus death toll state reach 8,505 July 25.



The UMass estimate comes a lab headed UMass Amherst associate professor Nicholas Reich that collects various coronavirus pandemic models develops combined, ensemble, forecast intended reflect collective wisdom.

Reich’s lab releases ensemble forecast weekly. creates forecast four-week window ahead believes forecasts aren’t reliable enough that. Last week, model estimated would 8,389 deaths tallied July 18.

Reich’s lab posts national- state-level data the Reich Lab COVID-19 Forecast Hub. lab, already Influenza Forecasting Center Excellence, collaborates US Centers Disease Control Prevention coronavirus predictions.

The lab also feeds data collected ensemble forecast agency, which posts data website. data also used to feed fivethirtyeight.com website.

The closely-watched University Washington Institute Health Metrics Evaluation model, looking future, offered bleaker vision, predicting Massachusetts see as many 10,154 deaths Oct. 1, possible range outcomes 9,480 11,402 deaths.

The latest UMass ensemble model also predicts United States whole see cumulative total 147,865 deaths next four weeks. Last week put four-week number 139,276. current US death toll 126,000, according Johns Hopkins University. Let's give Johnson much credit. UK team herd immunity onset Johnson caught went ICU?

The situation screamed classic conservative ""I empathy situation directly impacts me."" syndrome. Mental illness full display here. DC added 35 cases today. (population 700,000)

meanwhile Oklahoma (population 650,000) posted largest daily increase (+585) J p Morgan thinks otherwise Hi I'm r/wallstreetbets , we're putting together team, think need Except mask wearing data behind americans choosing ignore.

That's argument Americans Europeans made data came out. There's literally data showing virus spreading food

There allegations virus spread contact inanimate objects Hong Kong spread food would make cooking home difficult, too, unless grow food well.

That disagree, already know virus denatures moderately high temperature (60 degrees Celcius?). cook food thoroughly, fine. extension, think reasonably okay take-outs reheated high temperature people eat take-outs nice fresh Fortunately, (finally) certain politicians encouraging mask-wearing, folks going ""oh shit"", signs uptake.

Notably, Google searches ""masks"" up, particularly AZ. translates actual mask-wearing public outcomes remains seen (and reallyyy late game), glimmers 3.....2.....1and half.... here’s thing. running mask stupid, it’s best pick spot run it’s crowded. mask see people ahead. easy understand campaign done

The president actively suggesting opposite. Suggesting nobody needs wear mask. Suggesting wearing mask attack him. worded badly. mentioned another reply. shared post FB 50k day people saying wasnt big deal many critical condition required hospitalization. fair, could high number cases getting Los Angeles county makes hard get test. finally got slot, go 40 miles way wait 3 days, eh least something. U lookin shoes? dont care linked nothing asked you.

Why lying wrote? ""The state allowing stores gyms remain open restaurants still operate — including serving alcohol.'

I see sides. get owner's frustration singled businesses remain running hand bars least reason stay open pandemic. I'm sure booze flows customers give less less crap pandemic precautions.  really underestimate hunters. article withdrawn authors. Bazooka Bubblegum single piece inside wrapper. Cuz billionaires see number like 100,000 laugh. That’s like toilet paper them. ""We unwavering commitment ~~the safety well-being customers team members~~ profits""

FTFY I've never heard anyone getting paycheck twice month America. oc /Ventura County busy weekend. possible people try ignore la County closure well. think major part deaths also quite reached would dying recent spikes yet. coming soon, like later week. see uptick then, may good weeks without upticks, here's take see spike deaths later week:

Young people definitely threw caution wind, tend mostly see young people, especially places suspected mostly spread (bars). last two weeks, let's assume largely made young people... thing is, young people see young people, see parents grandparents, see friends... stay contained young people, there's many young people COVID right now, older population sure follow along next days / weeks. may see delay deaths, cases simply can't stay long without eventually spreading lot among older folks well.  virus 19 times harder spread outdoors thats without mask.  Protesters mostly mask always outdoors.  Look america right many infections coming factories, restaurants, gyms proven facts.  Ny hit hard closed indoor seating gyms numbers low.  Texas getting hit hard slowly backing indoor seating.  deny evidence want virus spreads air way.  fuck think everyone wear mask dont wash hands really stupid?  spreadung via air droplets idiot doesnt realize this.  Whatever cant talk anymore goodluck 2nd wave 👋 Time close barn door. Hey, wheres horses?  That’s stocks investments work. Someone needs help town. Yep, pretty much first impression, too. accident, let's put brave face bad job wait till over. still hope really ""worthy"" presidents row could fix decay. Well, there's plot twist.

Thanks finding me. Since graph total, rather per capita, favors EU even more, since population little larger. Still seems like medical outcomes better comparison tool, even moreso newest trends increased testing. really hope numbers seeing recently lead large death spikes moreissues hospital space.    area I’m in, said bring lunches classrooms. Teachers get face shields, masks. don’t see way go back fall, TBH like 20% US thinks it’s bullshit exacerbating situation. Probably many also think Bill Gates evil mastermind trying murder millions. think begs question happens never develop vaccine, least years.

If never vaccine, everything eventually reopen, 100% individuals deal risk. 

The entire economy can't operate 25%-50% capacity forever. Entire industries turn due non-supply demand reason.  

Like, imagine politician running office 2 years now:
""Sir, finally allow movie theatres open?""
""No. Vote me!""   56% cases CA make 39% population.

Nationwide, Latinos account 34% cases race/ethnicity make 19% population.

Cases among Latinos Arizona among several states, Texas, Florida, California North Carolina shown substantially increased rate COVID-19 among Latino communities. saddest thing people actually turning Bill Gates. one person tried warn us lot stop pandemic. 🤦‍♂️ San Quentin super-cluster grew overnight 832 cases 1,015 cases, according data state Department Corrections Rehabilitation (CDCR) — jump 22 percent, 183 cases. also five-fold increase since week ago, 219 inmates tested positive.  
   last Monday, 30 staff members prison also become infected. Department Corrections says five infected inmates released. cases yet listed ""resolved,"" today, prison counted first death, likely COVID-19. It’s strange level statements correct. 

Most common mask surgical mask provide protection around us. worn surgery. protect patients anything might transmit. 

For years medical professionals assumed masks provided protection wearer *that designed for!.* Sometimes data jumps you. Asian countries masks worn large portion population, virus control. 

For person respiratory pathogen trying get, respirator mask N95 mask worn protects parties. better masks reserved high risk groups medical community. crazy thing everyone wore mask, mask. would situation going face.

If high risk group, consider wearing N95 mask. available wear whatever can. turns out, something, anything better nothing. opinions best suitable measure. Chinese govts tend overreact sort situations directly threaten hold power -- non-democracy, losing power term-limited thing. CCP's largest legitimacy crisis three decades maybe ever, demonstrated clear fire anyone local govts messes things up.

That said, neither Japan Taiwan actually good comparison. Japan consistently clocking dozens cases every day, Taiwan huge unique advantage getting individual PRC tourists banned entry PRC last August. Neither *actually* done China has.

Really shitty insurance may pay around pocket 5k year, really bad thing considered. guys pay too, comes taxes. Give everyone days prepare, leave house 6 weeks.

Were around March? hard lockdown then. pandemonium. Essential stores/services could keep demand, soft lockdown lasted weeks. 130 million US households way prepared (and cannot prepare ""a days"") lockdown 1.5 months. Nevermind food, keep electricity water Then, come August 15th, done nonsense. over.

Great, August 15th, cases fraction were. happens August 16th? Interstate travel resumes, international commerce resumes. virus begins spread again. US Government well aware problems December/January nothing prepare contact tracing. continued punt problem. nothing prepare relaxing softlock April May. makes think magically manage track, isolate, contain virus August? know right. Like nothing mass riots everywhere. Damn bars!!! masks really effective sick people wearing them. I'm guy coined ""a loose cannon eventually points way"" months ago Trump, anything compared that. appreciate perspective (hopefully) giving Americans we're perceived - somewat rightly, opinion - countries watched foibles past years. part decline wealthy become wealthy ignore government, lead future Corpo-Feudalism. pumping calves, bro? referring BLM protests went people wear masks try careful. lot protests bay area bad.we actually one biggest SF ever seen Finally sense CDC Oh really not, dude? really not? :) 

Where then? exists - it? Regardless rebukes, point absolutley fundamental - exists, show is. 1-2 inches definitely far back enough.... also made yourself...? *Note: Africa's experience sugar roses anymore. coronavirus apparently killing hundreds several parts massive continent. 

But main point remains largely correct. America, John Hopkins literally called [the prepared healthcare system pandemic, clearly one least prepared. like optimism I'll okay California slides Pacific next big earthquake. doubt complicated, question whether safe. Mental regression terrible, I'm sure, playing Russian roulette seems worse regression. Perhaps know enough topic make informed judgement. Lol, say reading pandemic potential virus first known infected person even symptomatic? read:

WHO Screenshot posted text earlier. I'm trying troll, read site. think wonderful! Shows stupid whole state political party be. lock Texas months see anyone survives. Agreed, think we’ll happen. need thinking best strategies it. one ever went bankrupt underestimating intelligence American people. Coronavirus 2: Electric Boogaloo really sick comparing disastrous response US response Europe large. 

What's wrong wanting ONE sick?

Where line thinking come ""it's bad XYZ""? really.  tiny area abnormality might counted fraction rather full yes no. might subtract debatable percent people whose abnormalities pre-covid events. Iol Yep, basically beach counties, including mine, San Luis Obispo, see huge influx. Gavin could statewide won't. Even frustrating realize thousands people died NJ amd NYC, plainly showing deadliness seriousness virus. states time learn enact protocols prevent repeating happened you. literally went 2+2= 10. Hospitalizations deaths plateaued! everyone! Tine reopen summer! SERIOUSLY? hope voters states paying arrogance, take good look think leaders voted for, could done.

Wear mask! Filtering using UV-C ionization kill pathogens sufficient make HVAC safe. hope too, hope increases lead compliance mask recommendations, physical distancing, mitigation measures, lead leaders turning recommendations requirements. COVID stop spreading (until herd immunity reached path long filled deaths). people change behavior want get control avoid lockdowns.

Another thing note 5000 deaths per week might seem relatively low, still means becomes new normal we'll new #3 cause death US, beating accidents (including car accidents) fairly large margin. 5000 deaths per week better mid April, believe really aim better now. Poor record keeping/contact tracing. I’m sure state resources keep thousands cases. definitely backed time reopening though. Ok. nice day. Thanks commenting lack interest commenting. warned us 2015 ready next outbreak. watch ted talk... retrospect impressively target. throughout March widely conveyed death rate could anywhere 5-10% infected, disturbing footage shown wuhan. I’m pretty sure scared population enough lockdown. Anyone taking precautions knows risk  Restaurants purchased perishables preparation 2nd POS governor cancels money shit away. asshole. used get pills wife, co-pay 22 bucks. random checks insurance cards, me, said could opt pay cash instead. cost? 4 bucks. even generic.. brand.

The insurance gig rigged, worse mafia could hope run successfully. Thanks sacrifice. everyone like things would lot better virus might even gone now. California? It’s basically already. Florida shit show. question close, when. pray Disney knows better. time ticking though, see.  I’m terrified go back gym. We’re required wear masks don’t know. crazy reopen indoor dining *in US* 
other parts world indoor dining (with social distancing restrictions) forover month already without 'spike' old adage goes, ""This can't nice things."" Reopening schools madness. Yea idiots shore causing restaurants go re-open won’t reintroduce disease cause lock again? What's next? Hitler getting resurrected? Thats need good leaders sho dont give bailout money buddies give money businesses need most.  Restaurants, gyms, bars etc.  understand business owners dont want see indoors business without mask closed bad.  Thats best way slow havr vaccine could mouths lucky.  Europe signed contract vaccines end 2020. happens close indoor seating months hard hit areas?  could save hundreds thousands lives Nice username housing available abolish rent control. Well, still far impossible we'll never safe effective vaccine - better figure something out. Everyone acts like vaccine inevitable - isn't. likely, absolutely guaranteed. I’m little confused regarding stance antibodies/immunity, I’ve seen SARS antibodies found last 10+ years could expect COVID-19 behave way yet people claim antibodies even vaccine useless there’s immunity people keep getting reinfected.
Every time there’s research antibodies immunity people keep trying claim opposite, whys that? would virus behave different original sars-cov? Thank LA reported 33k tests might highest ever. Tomorrow lower CA trend definitely shitty. expect much closures week Southern California. dine restaurants still open? People remove mask eat servers travel table table. Large crowds. It’ll go away it’s warm outside! Exactly this. big learning curve new recipe, preparation time real killer. 

It's really managing workflow, professional chefs part dayjob, chain restaurants avoid simply streamlining everything pre-making much possible. Thought guys already tbf. 2 friends medical field told receive people covid19 another redditor friend told exact thing.. people complain testing don’t enough symptoms.. I’m glad making mandatory wear masks bus, it’s better nothing :) homework, Larry? think bartender able sue assault. think manditory $5000 fine kind assault. Plus damages. kind person deserve title human. Yeah... worked couple high-end craft bars myself, sheer amount labor bartenders go REALLY rough.

Serious props boss health insurance. worked ONE bar ""offered"" it, corporate spot. asked sign up, manager gave really confused look, like ""we what?""

Regarding ambience, who's gonna first bar open dystopian theming, person hermetically sealed pod, style 1960s futurists, serving drinks like Soma Quarantini? Take lemons, make lemonade, know? Paraguay's death rate 2.10 per million, Uruguay's 7.77, Guyana's 15.26 Bolivia's 86.87. missing apostrophe title would made much interesting. There’s new swine flu China. night clubs open?

In TX, they're classified """"""restaurants"""""" city they're in, they'd open 50% indoor dining. 

If happen serve alcohol, high chance """"""restaurant"""""" I'd imagine people sitting pretty close other. Technically could’ve worse NY didn’t react way did. It’s shame weren’t proactive... least reactive. Weird numbers jumped couple weeks riots Yeah they'd compare Lombardi NY whatnot happened drive past downtown rally every person saw wearing mask. One difference rally fairly short. hours, highly organized. Estimates range 5-20,000. ...what even trying prove point? Pandemics originated China. That’s controversial opinion, it’s empirically true. ""I know I'm gonna do""

Start uh, reading fucking book. New Zealand white, Asian.

That's Western media responding to. money better treatments medical management, promising results steroid treatments positioning prone examples. Try small cities, least east coast. community I've ever felt Charlottesville, VA Lancaster, PA. make never want move back DC suburbs.  thing happened NYC. feds care. would like buying one pair pants week, shirt week, socks week, on. don’t really shop clothes like people make one big trip mall buy ton stuff Wife reservations 8 years ago moving Jersey, say Murphy done everything right people state, bold move, commend it.  prison outbreaks need taken seriously public carry false assumption closed system. 
  
1) guards staff risk carry risk community 2) prisoners released transferred, potentially carrying infection 3) sick prisoners get transferred hospitals require ICU beds 4) they're human custody government entitled care, prison damn gulag. sister got covid19. family now? great idea. No, zero long enough, need lockdown. reopen back ""normal."" Ok - tests accurately detect RNA sequences, still scientific proof RNA sequences causative agent called COVID-19. 

So exactly testing for? think question fundamental whole issue? think people don’t get mask doesn’t enough keep safe, it’s keeping around safe. mask protects you, mask protects me.

I’m fairly certain Fauci tested 20+ times unlikely infect others. ""The best time plant tree back March, science said 'you absolutely planting many trees right now'. second best time plant tree now.""

It sound good. decision made based data science. cases people cleared testing positive again. knows long someone wait? data switching narrative virus weekly. Look, I’m debating greater risk. point is, risk. Agree disagree? Arent hiding numbers though? People agency choose actions would take.
 
Simply may judge actions support cause somehow nullify consequences actions may bring.

Especially lot people can't really control whether get it. people forced work this, healthcare professionals surely deserve disease. understand that. point less disbelieving threat virus, dishonesty media portraying situation manner creates controversy/clicks. 

All spite large amounts speculation, stated now. succeed, child call every morning. speak mom almost every day least 30 minutes shoot shit. 20 years. Wekiva Island? listen doctors health professionals, vampiric squid? #Translation:

Of covid patients cared [in Sweden] intensive care centers March, April May, one third hospitals 30 days, according statistics National Board Health Welfare.

Many cared intensive care unit numb respirator, unable move. human body, major challenge forced lie still long. 


- ill covid-19 end respirator, stay respirator long time. patients lying month, upwards 50 days, says David Hellgren Svae, chief physician anesthesia intensive care Södertälje Hospital.

The first ten days patient lies anesthetized lose three percent muscle mass every day. kept numb even longer continue lose muscle mass.

- leave intensive satisfied sit bedside living support. sit without support, great, says David Hellgren Svae.

In intensive care unit Södertälje Hospital, physiotherapist Lina Sjögreen Edsam working try alleviate consequences anyone sick bed long time. Routes solidify quickly muscles atrophy, thus disappearing, used. Lina Sjögreen Edstam bends joints massages thinning muscles.
- understand hurts lot muscles atrophy, massage softly gently. Hoping relieve pain guess have, says Lina Sjögreen Edstam.

She works patients anesthetized awake breathing help oxygen.

- happy patient smiles first time wake up. smile day, says Lina Sjögreen Edstam. Citation needed. species already touch faces pretty much constantly.  won't. Miami completely full shit. I've since outbreak started little enforcement anything. 1/2 people wear masks do, wear incorrectly.

The beaches, packed. islands, packed. boat ramp, packed. Social Distancing? That's band 90's right?

Florida one last places recover Covid-19 people plain fucking stupid selfish greedy.

Florida every bit shithole believe be, probably worse.  walk around suburban neighborhood EXCEPTIONALLY low risk Americans weird fear someone get help ""who deserve it"". That's worst thing history world could ever happen reasons.... dont think anyone problem people working.

Its going bars, body shots eachother, grinding strangers, going tinder dates, random hookups young people tend problem. best, can't always stay six feet apart sidewalk.

In words, didn't. trick walk trails always leave out. greatest danger face walk covid, getting run cross street keep distance. quoted 2 parts it, parts quoted wikipedia 

The full quote apparently ""Relief nothing, Indians breed like rabbits""

He let millions starve Damn, that's high-level Karen. That’s mean. Everyone needs interpretation “hypervigilant” means. That’s doubt article. must made mistake; lots parents brought kids protests probably thought careful well. source that? personally test positive, OPs employer intentionally asking /r/coronavirus getting form collective amnesia four months ago?

The CDC concerns PPE shortage (concerns realized NYC hospitals) *and* concerns mishandling masks leading people accidentally smearing active virus onto mucus membranes. 

PPE production scaled know means transmission worried surface transmission. tell see *lot* mishandling masks walking around; we're fortunate virus seems really require direct person-to-person droplet spread make major spreading event.

People acting like CDC behaving unreasonably told us stay home couple months let hospitals supply chains catch pandemic. Yeah, like talked social distancing get together family. none get there. it, things like that? think stories important vectors we're aware could impact spread significantly. Jeff Fillion team radio X Quebec actually encourage people go catch thing, ""we get herd immunity""... isnt criminally irresponsable? One day wake gone like miracle. Yet another datapoint showing this. Denmark Sweden probably two comparable Nordic economies heavily reliant international trade (Sweden exports, Denmark shipping). always seemed obvious successful suppression / Test, Trace, Isolate leading towards early resumption BAU would better economy long, drawn attempt get herd immunity. Glad hear. drug cost billion develop, vaccine probably 12 months road, normal luxury full patent life recoup costs. That's even less tests day they're Twins spring training site. think they're close 700.  People going see stop getting tested. national plan proactive pooled testing areas low positivity? 

Other countries months. seem built infrastructure needed it. Yeah, claim American... thousand years America idea. mean, things considered, blame people trusting authorities? I've read article, though put little faith VOX report anything correctly.

Medicare medicaid cover COVID treatment completely. CARES act covers COVID treatment anyone uninsured, insured people pay would disease ailment. really see major issue drug. Protest spreading it. See data many sites. Reason : people outside, mostly daylight, almost wearing masks, mostly 6 foot distance. read Testicles, time bed. “Flak” “trebuchets launching flaming scrap metal”, righteous world. Oh buddy, Americas reputation damaged destroyed. currently low bar. long better know we're OK. Trump destroyed country, people, economy respect anyone you. doubt Trump even spell initiative, let alone take it, please stay safe, take care, outside perspective, danger infection daily basis. Bars extremely dangerous communities right now. remain closed that’s negotiable. That's thing. people think drug new. *not*. around since 2009. Like aptly put it, sitting shelf completely useless. work intended purpose.

It work Hep C, developed for. tried use Ebola. Guess what, work. COVID... guess what... clinical trial China cancelled never spoken absolutely jack squat.

It cure you. miracle drug. quote, ""more effective placebo"" boosting recovery times 4 days. guess least actively killing people? Even NEJM said ""given high mortality despite use remdesivir, clear treatment antiviral drug alone likely sufficient."" Lancet basically said kill you, probably really whole lot either.

Like someone else commented, hell marketing campaign. absolutely impossible understand resistance masks. people start dying

Yup, preparing inevitable death family. relatives taking seriously all. cares losing side does? wonder well. one hand something history made doctors think ha covid. hand said hyper-vigilant actually want tell people first people looked ways blame put different category. feel pretty strongly I'm hyper-vigilant, got it, I'm sure one would believe me. I've seen report outbreak daycare Quebec, Canada, 12 27 kids infected 4 staff, totally clear whether spread happened center kids got independently infected home (unlikely impossible).  point, nobody knows - lot recent cases people die immediately disease. look existing data estimate.

Looking Worldmeters, total 2,683,301 confirmed cases US 1,431,891 active cases. corresponds ‭1,251,410‬ resolved cases - also 128,819 deaths. gives closed case fatality rate 10.3% - probably drop going forward early numbers included lot elderly people NYC accounts people getting infected generally younger result lower mortality.

For reference, South Korea (which lot testing assumed identified essentially cases) CCFR 2.3% - quarter current US one.

How much difference patient demographics much represents undetected cases US anyone's guess. kick out? really. virus hit vital spots US. Considering opposing party US's president, consistently demonstrating mindless thirst power last years, everything Trump could done would painted distorted negative color. 

When country 2 parties one says masks use, says protests fine, nothing virus. can't change culture value country one abrupt order.

The match supposed started one two missed punches would given victory. used go 24H place rampant. I'd change workout clothes home avoid locker room entirely.

I'm sex positive good lord. Get bedroom people! Data would skewed less people find work, opposition would argue UBI made us lazy. police going giving flyers now? People going thrown away. 

We need actual laws levy fines people wearing masks. another revenue stream local governments, addition parking tickets speeding fines. Nationalize them. Immediately. Arrest board directors. Set sentences 20 years. expect going need another lockdown, wonder going makes US empire collapse. possible explanations:

* Sweden half population density.
* Sweden distant (?), probably homogeneous culture.
* culture communal responsibility (?) - person community vice versa.
* Sweden never lifted anti-epidemic measurements.
* Swedish employees take paid sick leave.
* Summers great time outside, vs. hot people prefer stay inside.
* Keeping care home residents care homes (?)
* Advising patients low chance survival avoid ICU treatment (?) never first place people compliant. police stop going mates house picturesque Durham castle. high? Excess deaths talked since start. Cool peak epidemic Sweden testing limited done priority groups - severe symptoms, hospital care workers. Even people risk groups severe symptoms tested starts get worse. reliable statistic time number confirmed cases number ICU patients deaths. testing ramped massively last month, multiple regions (that cover think half country population) allowing people mild symptoms test Stockholm, roughly 25% Swedish population, even opened testing everyone, regardless symptoms. Thus cases surging, ICU deaths still going - opinion reliable measure severity situation. immunity antibodies use R0 values.

 *more people per capita died Sweden anywhere EU* 

Not quite. lot, quite top position. live Sub-Saharan Africa? India? Maybe SE Asia?

If not, really question going hellscape.

Is bad? Yes. us humans really good fixing problems made ourselves. already live deserts farm make work. 

Don't get wrong, WAY fight climate change, sitting middle class America children ones suffer climate change. fast, Houston. also list Russia, Brazil, China India emerging developing alongside Haiti. Yeah, economies same. cost subsidize distribution poorer countries. curious read things like that? 

Wondering get information, etc Wait, telling Bill Gates spreading coronavirus implants Xbox systems? ""Based history, suspect covid-positive.""

What? history? everyone get note? told something made suspect covid? ""We look officials going meet media. match criteria, allowed wear masks,"" Lam said. ""I actually told cannot wear take already wearing one."" 

 

&amp;#x200B;

 government staff feel unwell, work frontline services, attend crowded places wear masks, city’s chief executive said, referring advice issued World Health Organisation.

“We look officials going meet media, regular duties. match criteria, allowed wear masks,” Lam said.

“I actually told cannot wear \[the masks\], take off, even already wearing \[them\].”

While said cases start climbing Hong Kong, received news virus China city lockdown, means knew getting serious. hit hard SARS HK government trying downplay it, even CCP imposes city lockdown.

They want masks worn need face tracking systems work want anti-mask law pass. know, constantly bitching California, lot boomers sure live there. know it’s anyone else causing problem. Thank gawd Murphy right now. unfortunate group idiotic residents proven cannot take care need parent put timeout. failure one man

Its failure one man, people ideology represents.

Its failure huge portion people country think gubmint bad taking care basic needs liberal conspiracy. think they're confusing trust science trust authority broadly speaking yeah, get below-the-nose masks. wtf thinking. thanks life US much better Agree, data work blog seems almost completely ignore reporting lag. Let's turn everything pissing contest. would love know think Sick Unless put heavy police presence streets issue harsh fines, Leicester's lockdown name only. would stopping someone driving next town go shopping etc? Lol, wow stubborn, said opinion doesn’t mean it’s valid. good article Psychology today. Maybe read closed minded young age. Yea, things damn pricey. wife really pushing one living room expensive even discount... crazy high number mild cases tail end ^^ Yet another reason government put stop telemarketers years ago. people simply answer phone number unknown them. That's bad emergency situation. might antibodies counts towards immunity. r/Coronavirus/comments/hi72up/immunity\_to\_covid19\_is\_probably\_higher\_than\_tests/ misinformation seems spread quickly useful information? test may free ER visit not. Bidet! Get bidet! Guess unfortunately Americans, Trump never admit wrong this. really baffled? can't imagine got country? Hint: lack leadership. Title written like ""ska övervaka"" English ""shall monitor""/""are monitor"", nothing ""must"" gives conplete different connotation.
And absolutely unusual use private companies help Police everyday tasks (the understaffing Police thing here) Yea crossed mind wrote that... work highly conservative field TX. people aren’t wearing masks seem think everything overblown, really affects high risk people stay home avoid contact. think regular people fine—and they’re overwhelmingly right. don’t seem consider sick work weeks still shitty even aren’t hospitalized, still don’t want friends, coworkers, risk yourself. feel like knowing brings problem closer home.

My opinion one main issues COVID reporting making seem like death around corner anyone without mask, it’s really not. Feeding information gospel making people jaded it’s true. Sort plays point, think larger issue using compassion haven’t illustrated effect virus low-risk people. West Coast Best Coast 

Proud WA CA truly don’t understand mask backlash. Yes. It’s fucking uncomfortable. alternative sickness possibly death &amp; anyone come contact with.

As Dane, respectfully sudden, understood Denmark sky-high taxes prices constantly struggle student, including distinction world’s expensive Starbucks coffee. taxes come right back citizens form social safety nets matter most.

Yup. hey 30 different lists strong economies! Exactly revisit comment. older people antibodies. got lucky break genetic mutation made less deadly. beginning H1N1 outbreak around lethality Spanish Flu, made headlines. time hit densely populated areas already mutated like really bad 3 week long cold. wording suggests case load high enough mask use recommended. someone literally sells nothing PPE day, huge shortfall sort mask starting March. Federal government literally stealing shipments corporations April. reasons...

1) media outlets, *cough* fox news downplayed virus back March April created new herd people mindset virus deadly catch it. really educated virus whole, antibiody news mortality rate really pushed alot people rabbit hole narrative virus overblown. 

2) also help US government officials, including Dr. Fauci live national television explaining masks work wear early stages pandemic. 

3) America also built strong pillars personal freedom choice. Like not, alot selfish people america like told told wear mask infringing personal freedom. 

4) racially motivated..purely anecdotal people come across compared wearing mask wearing hijab...

Regardless America melting pot fucked ideologies current mess are...and poor government leadership also play huge role well. We're number one, we're number one. Oh hold wait. Can’t get profit lives profit coming would interesting encouraging death rate current spike turns much lower. really know changes case fatality rate late July. Detecting changes infection fatality rates (by age) require really good (and big) serology studies major hotspots--to parallel done New York. heard whether Texas, Florida, Arizona big serology studies track. Cases need steeply rising trend serology capture current risks dying. Otherwise get mostly people long recovered showing positive antibodies (likely results Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Rt close 1.0). dare try save lives!!! Enforcement education. damn near aneurysm every time see moron wearing mask nose. Like guy meme: number people know wear mask (or intentionally wear masks wrong) damn high. correct translation ""will"" ""must"". hope ruin propaganda much though! No, punished company taken grater good humanity. No, true. hardest hit states include possible covid deaths, even suicides touch buffoon. Fucking Christ. American obsession thinking obsessed america...

We cant help laugh level idiocy. Reading articles. studied history 11 years. job so.

'We could give shit you'.

I worked John Hopkins University. Thank goodness Americans like you. intelligent ones anyway. sad people like drag US down, days numbered. surprising find case like this. always reducing risks, eliminating them. 

Making numbers here, measures woman took reduced personal risk one hundred one million, much less likely get it... million people take exact measures, still expect one get virus.

However, million people take precautions reduce risk, one hundred rate infection 10,000 cases. 

Many people read articles like think worth talking precautions might one woman got virus anyway, vastly likely they'll one 9,999 get virus took precautions. pro-side; took even half year adapt. get think definitely necessary many instances, especially idiot refuses wear mask sneezes coughs suddenly. mentioned worry setting people seated near one another long periods time. issue upfront honest timelines virus. locked usa, officials told people would two weeks... well two weeks turned two months. said two months start people would outraged, end two months would better compliance. long anyone allow strung along lied stop listening altogether.

Everyone gets temperature checked upon entry you’ll turned it’s high.

The biggest probably defining factor... leaders, every one them, defer medical health professionals make informed decision. They’re also visible masks virtually 100% time public space. aren’t get crucified media city’s citizens. extreme.

You're giving way much credit private industry, basically research either done government handed them, backed government funding. don’t need vaccine; need elder sign. it’s not. even post subreddit removes posts talk blame this? persuaded move event outdoors refuse mask/distance? Indoors much riskier. "" odds primary case transmitted COVID-19 closed environment 18.7 times greater compared open-air environment. "" Good refusing go, good luck family. resilience, indeed require several generations evolve*

By genetic resistance (note: believe mean accurate term given context fields microbiology immunology; genetic usually refers something else) seem thinking genotypes selected evolutionary pressure; example, [inherited resistance HIV. That's people talking about, getting downvoted oblivion. long-term lasting immunity require genetic proven several times antibodies lasts 2-3 months different strains reinfect recovered patients*

You seem either lacking confusing fundamental knowledge immune system functions. Perhaps find article informative: [Coronavirus immunity 'MORE estimated', Professor makes bombshell cell well Wikipedia article *immune system*, specifically section separate [innate immune responses.

It's important note threshold scientific medical claims quite high. CDC even says ""*it remains unknown whether persons detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies immune reinfection*"". Though reasonable inference assume presence antibodies protect re-infection short term many viruses there's even [research done shows promising affirmative results, CDC still hesitant say antibodies protect reinfection even short-term. That's level concrete understanding right now: **very little**. Yet, seem quite assertive ""*there hundreds confirmed reinfections worldwide*"" although claims confidence berating disagree seems prime example Dunning-Kruger effect; though worry, we've there.

**The truth matter simply know enough make factual claim one way another**; hints evidence lean towards optimistic case. get infected February March, recover, next September October person infected believe going protected. know 100% sure, think reasonable assumption.*

You tried. read lies. mean believe them.

The problem government refusing necessary defeat pandemic. Blaming different age cohorts, races, groups lack action authorities bald lie, intended distract dumbest Americans badly they're getting fucked. solution high number cases US! Call Dr immediately. ex-gf go Javitz center NYC. Army nurse. remember correctly said brought field trauma equipment, right tools job. couple ventilators couple guys kind knew use. 

In Chicago built bunch alternate care facilities. news kept saying hospital capacity, field hospital, etc. Words make think getting level care hospital. think high school gym hurricane housing residents community. Except medgas (oxygen, vacuum, medair) nurses. conscious, would rather treated home. I'm unconscious, guess matter much. They've business family since 1962 five restaurants. closing. They're closing seating.

The people eating dine-in restaurants right absolute worst customers. Concentrated asshole. Ok donald check daily excel file FHM it’s 7650 cases week 26, fair highest. press conference said 74k tests done week 26. means it’s 10,33% positive tests. Isn’t great news? work preschool fully expect numbers less, maybe even half. Right covid started taken seriously class went 24 6, back March. didn’t make clear. children whose parents taking them. all. Ever. risk death trauma. It’s hard know risk cause greater harm society. understand concern travel Europe either.

However I'm sure racism. least Germany, native Germans first hotspot Heinsberg second hotspot Güterloh tell similar tales: Cars keyed, tyres slashed, people got spit insulted. Oh ok then, guess everything hunkydory then! Nothing see folks! Yep, speak mom daily. moved last week, she’s coming today help unpack. Came Friday, too. tell parent obviously weighed difficult decision keep child home figured way balance child’s distance learning/homeschooling professional responsibilities ability earn income. Congrats. super human being!

Now could please enlighten rest us supposed work make money demanding, school aged children home would great. 12 days test (which usually post-symptoms) death. Everyone thinks number much higher actually is.

It take weeks death adjudicated officially reported that, though. disputing US full selfish people. seriously fucked US got there. Like voted people trust?

And uhm well even people trust government made wear masks countries face penalties. I'm sure there's requirement there.  H1N1 nice, kick bottom 5 min. First thing wake take leak, wake head floor able stand own. you’ll transferred hospital nurses feeding you’re laying down/barely sitting blood flow slow keep functioning. Mix millions COVID-19 cases got = “it’s flu”
Too many humans learning actually happens them. watch spread unless going close areas That’s true, live Minnesota nobody bothered actually talk neighbors. Lol  outsider pretty much spot on. education system joke here. voter turnout due voting system set keep people voting making ten times difficult vote. 

That could easily change let people vote app bothered waiting lines poles, taking time work ""valid ID"". 

Taking time work big one. everyone works good white collar job. people work McDonald's places like that. mention extremely easy unaware voting days take place. IE idea democratic primaries took place. dates different state happened around lock downs. goes voting local level. 

This country screwed long time, minds occupied sports ball, celebrities, trying famous social media overreacting whatever topic news picks. Ok, opinion fucking matter. Holding rich people higher society experts, i.e. virologists 2016, career politicians, got USA point first place.  Better plan.  revoke patent send generic drug manufacturers. Right... employer even get information? 
Here would (normally) get sick note doc. Repeating lie make less lie.

The main issue pandemic country refusing quarantine citizens political reasons.

Blaming citizens getting sick pandemic government refused deal trumpiest shit I've ever heard. Hey that's whole story. Also staying home thing that's actually killing people. Also anyone wearing mask either sheep, actively trying get give real valuable rights. Jesus wept. regard women city? provided financial support. choice Coronavirus poverty. always trail weeks, though.

I wish people would stop saying this. trail month. Heck, recording official reporting death takes takes time, sometimes weeks, doctors fill death certificates health officials adjudicate deaths. finally added official state tally.

Florida still reporting new deaths long ago late April! devastating. Like said, easy solution. 100% right downvoters people kept ego war going science virus transmission general. Denial care death cases rising? Weird conclusion. Hospitalisations also decreasing. would assume it’s okay travel car, celebrate outside practicing social distancing. cannot find long effect (hopefully indefinitely). family thinks going mission trip Europe September think nuts. Fingers crossed ban indefinite. last thing Europe needs mission groups socially distancing. long provide said masks, finally managed get ONE mid April respiratory problems stop eventually Might get herd immunity vaccine anti vaxxers.

[Fauci says Covid-19 vaccine may get US herd immunity many people refuse get moving mesh masks... Depending Volvo talking about. social media regular media held accountable part spreading misinformation? Honestly early 2021. Maybe sooner. last two sentences. gone actual reasonable discussion fingerpointing again. 

The reason discussion frowned upon numbers, protests linked rise COVID cases unlike cases exploding restaurant bar-goers. let's real, gonna catch viral load crowded bar outside. european? Europe fact Swedes pretty racist well known thing.. president humiliates us, squanders every advantage. young people/healthly people getting dying needing hospitalized. beginning tested old people unhealthy people death hospital stays high. majority people mild sickness sick all. Thus doesn’t really matter 100k people contract day long people old unhealthy won’t die need hospitalization. give thoughts paper posted? Really want know conservative's opinions world's prestigious medical journal published paper intravenous disinfectant back February one mentioned news. Utah massively, massively massively disagree. would perfect world. perfect world. Yes, sadly. Testing effectiveness vaccine requires exposure.  2 week lag exposure symptoms, require long test periods unless accelerated voluntary exposure. thing is, completely dependent people do. people change behavior.

It's like predicting hurricane, difficult well, making prediction, also change people's behavior, changes outcome. Ontario government gave restaurants emergency temporary permits essentially extend patio parking lot onto sidewalk you. restaurants I'm sure unable take advantage, help solve lot issues regarding capacity keeping everyone outside. idea fall/winter brings though :( They're plain dumb, willfully inconsiderate both. plan seek therapy don’t want medicine don’t know anything besides medicine would actually help me. relying government. relying scientists. Trump testing vaccines, scientists world are.

I'm racing get vaccine, matter country winds winning race. I'm sittin' batch 2, there's always possibility sloppy QC something's rushed. mean take several years know safe.

Every organization made lot mistakes this, even including WHO. Also, recall, accuracy data tests known, provisionally approved needed SOMETHING, better nothing. lot tests like world. Even now, there's still accuracy issues lot different places.

Just keep mind whichever vaccine winds coming US, also convince rest world. dumb administration is, system's actually held surprisingly well onslaught authoritarianism coming Oval Office, think there's reason hope.

Just perspective someone spent lot time living come conclusion humans pretty flawed ever go. 1st grader 4th grader. school just... ended. individual teachers weekly zoom chat provided couple videos... 4th grade teacher recorded reading chapter book weekly math problem, got feeling choices. official curriculum, assignments, grades. little homeschooling come with. didn’t end lot “teaching” per se (and am) working home, 100% responsible coming activity wasn’t screen time. didn’t mind much getting bit break at-risk household - read daily, books home, discussions home-cooked dinner every night. couple months international crisis IMO huge deal. next year whole ballgame. really need school district pull together system doesn’t require constant supervision me. actually changes I’m going kill never tried make fight, kind assumed ran it. 

I also never really inserted opinion. Correlation, matter strong, causation. That's opinion, that's fact. also fact there's proof vitamin supplements help, fact masks slow spread.

I guess opinion stated Rogan know better... maybe shouldn't? Tegnell: [""In Sweden don’t wear facemasks, stay home we’re (23:50) least we're honest sub, lot subs politicized this. Granted lot cities spiking waiting 100s ways get pneumonia? Dollars burger. go Applebee's get one drink refill 12 dollar burger I'm giving tip 6 7 bucks. That's way high. I'm 3 4 5 maybe great service. speed Looks like aggressive early action part re-close regions. thankful governor. actions got Michigan's cases control first place, looks like intends keeping control. lots racists Sweden. right wing populist movement grown major parts Europe Sweden well.

With said. article found couple instances this. experience widespread. asian friends Sweden worn masks since february. also convinced parents wear masks shopping. received hatred. live one large cities though. Might different countryside. real job lol one wears masks public like rest country. Hmmm long ya think?

*Two Weeks*........ pretending family member died flu A?

No, no, he's, uh, he's resting. Look Gütersloh, Germany: local police tests quarantines thousands people together Bundeswehr. cool story bro. Don’t sure smart guys! Don’t forget (as could), neighbor divided conquered, belligerent asshole prideful bootlickers money-worshippers! Never underestimate reach administrations DEMENTED STUPIDITY!

I’ll pray you:/ guys awesome, except redneck shitbags, like ours. 

Save us! Ok dog Longest dead cat bounce history? can't think reason *would* trust authority Individualism gone rails. headed cliff. now? sham. First California, Washington, Oregon. notice pushing agenda lockstep once.

When type thing continues occur begin realize nothing numbers, simply tactic induce panic authoritarian screw turned even tighter. Indirectly? Patients ICU 201 144 cases week. 57 less.  


Mild cases (""Lindriga"") light green.:  


Number tests (wedish):  ^smol ^Cthulu recently realized shitty fact... people wanna wear mask rubs off/messes makeup. Stupidity + Vanity = Even Worse. out·stand·ing

1) exceptionally good
2) remaining paid, done, dealt with

Guess number definition word 'outstanding' education represents? 

I'll answer really intellectually flaccid. 2nd one, in, 'You need deal finish education yours, brain barren' tbh. said back January people subreddit laughed, mocked told wrong constantly saying smugness prepared worry.

They would link sources claiming prepared chart too. 

Morons. like waiting see bad get forced help general public really wish people would engage activity called 'critical thinking' instead blindly following footsteps others.

I kind wish T\_D existed could go see stupidly people promoting needing wear mask. Sunlight best disinfectant idiots parasites. yes honestly, it'll probably peak around 2.5-3 million deaths, it'll slowly come control. that's optimistic, could easily go 200-300 million dead. Haha, vitamin C there. VOX reporting Morris sources including Wall Street journal New York Times. I’d say case article trusted. 

I’ll say personally, find morally reprehensible charge someone drug they’ve already contributed development. Especially drug helps general public reducing spread viral outbreak. 

“We’ve always done way” terrible reason continue something, general charging people medical care medicines USA tradition I’d like see continue. 

Speaking someone excellent insurance low zero pocket costs, think need away model. month ago deaths much higher. situation much better 

Deaths steadily declined since, thankfully It’s like fuck business something unethical. Make couple Billie, get funded couple Millie 🤷‍♂️ 'barely any', lot them. sad...

I couple N95's wear get groceries necessities. use surgical masks work.



Only one store town enforcing masks I'm wondering gave yet due anti-maskers... :-\ I’m low body fat trying lose fat? thats good. yeah im fence either playing like im taking continue treat get new doctor....that might hard right though covid..... Well I'm glad area safe. live CA really gross many people care others. area I've heard true across CA people wear masks unless forced businesses wrong way communicate importance wearing mask.  reinforces lie risk makes choice. 

The alternative wearing mask shutting economy. two effective ways reducing spread keep virus control. wearing mask costs people jobs, locks people home, destroys businesses. selfish, irresponsible, officials *horrible* job communicating this. heard live year without blood meal that’s probably outlier Lol obvious, people care others. Literally, people knew everyone street kids doing, street 1 km length. west, even know immediate neighbor. Dollar's best hope bunch economies tie currency value Dollar, goes down, too.

If ever see bunch countries start de-linking currency Dollar, shit's go down. let Trump regulate social media misinformation prevail. Amen that. restaurant I've recently woman complaining *have* keep dining area closed. woman behind counter dead eyed look 'We deli specializing take home meals. dininging area whining two patio tables' OK Karen. bad cases reported mostly fake Yeo love taking hour money part it’s payout part trouble with. say plague quote? Well could narrow coronavirus ones, believe 3 part job. That's obsession imbecile. That's called duty.

Dont refer dog. one person doesnt mask, infect hundreds people even masks on. enough people without masks events infect everyone thing is, Gen Z fully job market yet. There's zoomers still high school therefore living provided parents.

Millennials generation mid-20s early-40s mostly expected independent market good state since became adults.

Not trying reject post btw. Zoomers absolutely fucked situation improve coming years, like millennials are. I'm hoping people start rethink safety modern animal agriculture, every time human interacts animal there's chance zoonotic disease jump. Even talking safer practices like hunting, gave us HIV/AIDS. every factory farm / animal market / slaughterhouse planet basically time bomb disease. sit 2 weeks go back playing decades right wing media echo chamber growing growing. Right wing radio...is *insane*. Much worse Fox millions listening it.

Then came internet.... /r/eyebleach would help us today I'm seeing argument made here. criteria think met used term first time. Also, aware highest level alert quite time PHEIC? example, Tedros first used word made clear nothing terms response changing declaration PHEIC Jan 30. I'm advocating using prisons case studies, interesting see percentage outbreak stops at. Behold intellectual wonder. bow guy’s google research. This, anything amount doctors say, convince politicians mandate masks Nah called reports mask wearers assaulted started emerge. thing summer break every year. Whatever - whatever plan place take care children - keep it. place job figure someone take care kids even trying say here? Yes, deaths pretty much entire country shut weeks. cases rapidly rising, deaths lag behind cases several weeks takes Covid kill people even longer deaths reported official channels. knew someone would say this. OK Karen. much number people died regardless COVID19 discussion COVID19. Jaw dropping numbers people take antibodies test find deaths don’t increase drastically There's lot data says otherwise. MERS - Saudi Arabia  Look hospitalizations man. try pretend isn’t bad it’s overblown somehow keep running ICU beds filled people sick dying Covid. 

The sooner people would acknowledge really fucking bad political issue (the virus real need mitigate) sooner get back normal state. obsessed America studied history 11 years. Dog joking? Gotta get snus guess (illegal sell Finland, import ""personal use"" legal). professional athletes get infected? basically kills point 2 3. issued guidance masks worn elder care lol sigh: editorial recently along much outcry led Tegnell saying may reconsider masks:

http://archive.vn/x60I7

But basically changed much masking. makes sense considering they're ""it's complicated"" breakup phase herd immunity; outright said they're abandoning yet behavior seem really mixed moving towards Test, Trace, Isolate model continuing been. what? Covid exit strategy show overall number much important number would whatever City  protests stopped. plus super jeebus. That’s shake hands President Bartlet instead. really difficult US population used least 90%+ believe masks. takes lot bravery mandate masks, almost certainly work US would end like China, means almost nothing happens, new cases, everyone fine sick, leader mandate masks end looking like fool since nothing happened. Swine flu originated Mexico.

Spanish flu originated Kansas.

MERS originated Middle East.

Yes, SARS coronavirus originated China, pandemics do. could happen right political environment. what's stop next politician abolishing it? country run Wall Street - little concern public good unless affects bottom line. CA issued statewide mask order June 18th. Unfortunately law enforcement areas refuse enforce it. I've using sales last 3 months. Oh, shipment Germany used take 1 - 2 weeks 6 - 8 weeks? want pay extra UPS/DHL/FedEx? hear there's global pandemic effecting supply chains? Yeah, world changed little baby, try keep up. Europe's countries Sweden's situation anymore. yes, many mandate masks least understand people use them, acknowledge they're useful stopping spread. Unlike Swedish authorities. like we've known months virus spreads presymptomatically asymptomatically. plenty outside things socially distanced environment: camping, hiking, canoe/kayak, fishing, cycling, jogging, picnic, beach (where open), etc. need sit inside house need visit peoples houses socialize. really lives end, isn’t it? isn’t going get better. fucking end. may point Taiwan et al come away fewer cases, recoveries, fewer deaths. Sure, pneumonia deaths suddenly 4x greater year everyone lockdown makes sense. fewer deaths since everyone cautious. need quit Facebook.

You need unfriend dumb people.

Although feed people constantly complaining people refuse wear masks, gets old fast. pretty obvious read article. company wrote press release, Inovio (INO). guys misinformed even funny. used say whole mask thing saying necessary. says wears mask public recommended. may dumb thoughts times least capacity change mind hear people out. listened latest podcast (such Bret Weinstein) would gotten people get sound bites.

Lastly, acknowledges dumbass doesnt mean isnt worth heard. intelligent conversations people time. would recommend sitting listening latest jocko Jordan Peterson telling still meat head. Must watched Jersey Shore MTV  mention know exactly talking about. 

The first time zucchini got yellow flowers( much smaller) like Huh, that's weird! 

I remember female parts too. look like moment, remember THOUGHT zucchini. plant taking everything haha. 

Thank much! I'm going double check tomorrow. lol hardly anyone would go This. little islands ridiculously hard infect.

But strategy broad stealth transmission turning lethal good model right now. Herd immunity proven virus yet. Agreed. friends saying follow guidelines post IG stories pool dozen's friends without masks other. go place open basically rarely wear mask. talking idea. No, helping contained taking selfie's 20 strangers crowded bar without mask. weird think done this.

What wildly bad assumptions many people make. ""freedom"" mentality ingrained Americans hundreds years. Add social media, everyone soap box, plus general idgaf attitude recipe disaster.

The American stereotype true. normal people dragged crazy. 2-3% resources. people likely suffer getting coronavirus stay home federal gov provides safety nets. Cause totally get going outside work it’s difference roof head not. getting groceries cause instacart luxury. great philosopher Mike Tyson said 'everyone plan get punched mouth'.

We got punched mouth mouth decided go run bunker hide, maskless. sad care behavior makes person's life dangerous, basically unlivable.

But keep pretending care anything yourself. Surely another plague rat fall nonsense. Garages/mechanics literal worst area. blatant disregard CDC guidance everyone involved. got maintenance done car recently took less hour, offered spot tiny waiting room past 4 months kind personal fever dream. found excuse go walk outside. never said didn't. clients 19yr daughter hospital. happens, also hospital flu 2 years ago worse Covid19 3 weeks ago released fine now, health issues etc, happens. even minuscule % already minuscule %. thats life general, shit happens, honestly think people know finally realizing life roses utopia actually quite cruel. friends daughter breast cancer 11yr old. Know rare is, bet 99.9% population even know, happen female children.

I fam ER physicians Denver CT. nurses know icu covid wings, two live street. blown lil proportion. Take FL, many employers require double negative, test counted singularly. one neighbor people tested 13+ times thats counted positive every single time. ridiculous. people somehow flip flopped counted case March, fine say May, tested June positive counts another separate new case. media explodes flawed numbers anyone half brain see coincide true cases, even FB feed see people like ""10,000 people"" 10,000 people death bed hospital even fractionally true. mentality running rampant. CDC even admitted estimate 20 million have/had it, showing less risky risky give actual numbers really changed except instead based way smaller group set, saying entire time like 20m+ including never knew. Watch next month, they'll flip say wrong again, think 100m+ have//had it. issue, CDC/Who/Fauci completely dropped ball flip flopped around like chickens heads cut off, hell Fauci even said pay attention numbers statistics flawed.

How Delray got reported multiple floors full covid patients ventilators. text uncle whose ER there, he's super liberal, even like remotely true. media pushing fear mongering agenda people gobbling up.

I wear mask gym, sucks, I'll gladly able workout. Well yes children less likely get covid associated disease. Kids arnt going work enmasse going public much. schools reopen would see uptick? Absolutely extent know. That's us parents wary school cant control anything right [This exactly picture someone denies science looks, virus ain't really real gosh durn media hypin up* Maybe print buisness cards hand out?  What? even reply right comment? friend mine who’s resident told group chats different hospitals country. May hit chat died. didn’t prepare. people charge didn’t give fuck &amp; got cocky. people paying it. country needs better leaders almost everywhere. ain't Chief Well right. lot easier literally die didn’t wear something would’ve prevented getting sick commentary general time period  Everything seems biblical days. Look Mormon Crickets. They’ve taken 8 states US said show 50% crops Ya, concerning. read nurses depts. called trained quickly deal either emergency critical care patients. One nurse said first time intubated person afraid killed person. guess rule following covid theories:

\- covid less deadly areas heat sunshine

\- outdoor lifestyle states like Florida large outbreaks

\- like flu go Summer Ohio (member party DeWine) here. us Covid denial business.

I’m proud Gov. DeWine hope continues make tough decisions keep Ohio turning New York (now) Arizona.

These Idiots attacking shameful. embarrassed them. reads like college student's term paper. Taking bets much tomorrow. 

I got least 9,500 Never wildest dreams would imagine restaurant dining barbershops would hill Americans would die upon. get Morning Consults polling newsletter, despite people still wary things like malls movie theaters, alarming number see problem dining restaurants. Literally, environment take mask chew, surrounded people eating, smacking, talking, 

It create illusion normalcy. know chinatown restaurants country reopen even government lets them.  two weeks ago. Remember 7-10 days memorial day spike started said ""shit'll hit fan 4th"" everyone else laughed said WaIT TwO WeKS LOLz called us doomsayers? Ok America shithole country then. guess I’m one edgy starbucks kids, huh. America better countries bombs destabilizes. perspective. don’t care history books told you. You’re weird husband tested June 19th. Still result. makes wonder old numbers are. people tested? no, saw reddit code hides vote counts, someone else. hardly upvote downvote all. 

And revenge fantasy. think comments like weight them? immediately panic going create kind double whammy pandemic kill everybody, important watch. 

It's secret flu coronaviruses capable pandemic level spread detected increasing rates, blamed largely practices modern industrial farming. 

It's things get wargamed time public preparedness. true, would convalescent blood serum work better monoclonal antibodies? concern, too. fine initial shutdown get spread control. I’m fine localized shutdowns areas surging cases overwhelm health care system.

But idea living state suspended activity vaccine? think that’s ridiculous. well may never get vaccine. virus remain us long time. Lies. right next 98% conviction rate. Riverside stronghold racism think hiding 21,000 dead people?

Because even catch New York I'm try Adam Ragusea's [Chipotle-glazed Shrimp Garlic Lime could see easily turning taco recipe additions. place run cadre retirees couldn’t care less anyone themselves. No, must’ve read article misinterpreting Sweden’s strategy. 
Anders Tegnell clear since start. follow proven methods stop spread. claims countries went lockdown political pressure rather anything proven actually work. also says reopening countries who’s tried lockdown facing large risks. 

He claims epidemics/pandemics strictly dependent faith population authorities recommendations. think pointless try correct lied beginning?

Who trust then? Since gathering raw data yourself. dont deserve livable wage then? Today's 2 probable SC cases definitely super inflated number. Anything you

I'm always willing help

I'm bad haiku's Thanks Trump administration’s guidance. HEY! read headlines comments.  us sophisticated, ya know? need apologize. Looking back hilarious. Gotta find kind humor days. mono joke. Knew bunch people high school colleges it. looks like takes quite toll. [NYC daily new cases peaked April saw [massive one day spike deaths May average deaths steadily declining since beginning April. number reasons this:

1. vulnerable exposed population get virus first, overwhelm hospitals, die large numbers. 
2. Medical professionals getting better understanding treat virus greater % people get surviving.
3. Younger people getting virus disproportionate rate.
4. hospitals increased potential Covid capacity meet demand, ""flattening"" death curve.
5. lockdown working, initial wave deaths comes people contracted virus lockdown testing really got going.

Compare NYC's numbers say, [much different say deaths lag behind new cases virus long incubation period, depending show symptoms, could weeks testing positive feel sick enough go hospital. Let's say 10% people test positive need see doctor, that's still 1,000+ people per day places like Florida.

I know someone went ventilator April *still* hospital recovering. People taking ICU beds tend need long time.

So, necessarily true deaths spike / correlate 2-weeks time positive spike, consistent data lockdown / quarantine / facial covering requirements place, like saw beginning outbreak. Sure, difference is, force them. One thing people talking about. Daily new cases appear time high, death per day lowest since end daily death chart. deaths per day definitely bell shaped curve. 

Of course one wants contract COVID, appear getting better treating preventing worst case outcome. would use term ""democracy"" pretty loosely referring US point. Data personal recommendation.

 next! simple really. Wear masks reduce virus spread save lives allow us reopen economy.

Masks save lives economy. still can't provide evidence, name calling ad hominem attacks. Got it. Keep closed listen CDC worst case end june 100,000, turns probably month Yes, often make error thinking US, without consideration states variations...


It come naturally Canadians, since provincial variations well... inactivated virus vaccine, following traditional approach. Hope works. 

There's plenty opportunity conduct effective trials India since situation spiralling control. Beer Pong, Darts, Pool.

All 3 multiple people touching/using objects. three alone could spread virus like crazy, nevermind standing should-to-shoulder yelling drink order.

Restaurants poorly paid kitchen staff wait-staff simply can't afford stop working symptoms sickness. Even savings could take off, owner/management usually demand come work anyway NEEDED.

How often menus properly santizized? kitchen staff wearing masks &amp; gloves times extremely warm/hot kitchen?

A lot small cities suburbs hundreds kids elementary students. could theoretically create cohort 5th 3rd grade siblings. Let's say 40 kids, 20 families. 40 kids could ride bus together attend class two grade level classes within group. could recess together. would seriously limit exposure allowing children socialize. base family groups rather location.

Most families 1-3 children spacing usually 1-4 years. decent sized community could probably build closed cohort siblings. would fairly big groups children, would still risk mitigation. 

All kids bus route, kids class, kids sibling's class could easily equal 90+ kids. Add recess could looking 200+. Family based cohorts could get 40-60 kids. perfect, significant.

Obviously larger families would issue, deal breaker necessarily. Time Stopping Vampires ""I believe.""

We've seen lot reports, example, asymptomatic cases still experience really dangerous disease states.

I've also seen cases person asymptomatic month two hospitalized interstitial double lung pneumonia. Unbeknownst them, lungs flooded blood notice unable breathe.

We know sustain irreversible organ damage eventually die unless eligible transplant. hear little cases, too. honestly know talking about. Everything echo chamber hate filth days.

One reporters USC weekend said thing. 

What’s going on? guess. without proper contact tracing mask mandates, economy would paused indefinitely result virus controlled ... Oof. Yes, standard care now, doctors learned mistakenly using ventilators resulting many patients dying.  Blah blah, dead people died death sentence people, it’s flippant oh it’s hardly anything attitude that’s stopping going away.

That's it. see bars stay open. shame seem major sources spread really need handful bars cause major spike. federal government going give bar restaurant industry money keep closed. 

At point much saving economy much saving lives. Closing bars restaurants definitely hurts economy, let spread go unchecked eventually gets control forced things like shut much important parts economy like healthcare system, schools daycares, food processing, courts, etc. Many colleges really straining incentivize staying school.

It’s dangerous, it’s serious, it’s issue. article early April explaining changed what

The key worm use EVIDENCE. data January, advice masks? data studies arrived apopted recommendations. That's science works.  much America's big stick policy, we're another snowflake country. still understand there's debate masks! baffling anti-vax stance. everyone got vaccinated, everyone would safer (especially folks can't get vaccinated themselves). everyone wore masks, everyone would safer (especially folks can't wear masks themselves). I'm left conclusion American public selfish/misinformed make right decision. honestly never ashamed American. Lot cheaper also.  Nice I'm one think coronavirus overblown proportion wide margin. majority population safe easily shrug infection.

That said, still face mask car anywhere go, barely inconvenience hurting wear attempt keep spreading around possibly infecting someone risk.

Face masks required public areas like parks beaches sidewalk, business requires one enter people right dispute that. also issue government steps inand enforces anyone entering business wear one. “A substantial number hotel rooms still vacant, never filled,” Vann said. “And many homeless people haven’t accepted process set keep rooms available case infection surge, individuals test positive, symptomatic, directly exposed virus, highly vulnerable health eligible live one-third available rooms filled. lot homeless people still living tents worried contracting coronavirus. Everything seems distant fucking isn’t lol. People always laughed around would bring Covid China look now. Insane! yet big cowards say mask mandatory 🧐 Well honest (not cdc anyone else said) ""we know"" ""could pose big risk"" bit suspicious decided (at beginning) go way using/wearing it. Considering unlike well basically western country NA Europe, Australia, ... countries level world modern history fighting viral spread (""pandemic"") east asia heavily masks public special training either (well tbh masks common still particular training general) bit strange decision made light countries modern experience problems (and recommending us step harder beginning).

It makes wonder, situation person wearing mask Korea USA Europe still person still mask unlike NA Europe Korea lot experience I'd assume western countries would lean towards that.

Well said related whether CDC organisations countries well not, point puzzles :-0. lol chill devolving argument perceptions. 

In perception, tip toed around Chinese political machine, cautious making formal recommendations restrictions border closures. Sure, raised alert level, overly publicize it.

Sure sucks broke going broke regardless. long going broke. 

The worse make state longer going take state recover less money going make interstate commerce, conventions tourism. everyone played ball get-go there'd less cases, less risks, quicker return normalcy.

Since politicized virus targeted idiots support cause states going continually shut businesses morons running amok. Jesus Christ, people upvote even blatant lies long they’re bad.

There plenty beds plenty vents. Javits center, ship, field hospitals went largely unused normal hospitals able expand capacity. 

The thing happened New Jersey. 3 field hospitals didn’t even really need see many patients hospitals able sufficiently expand capacity. times hospitals went divert status full sent people ones nearby that’s totally normal occurrence happens time time various reasons.

:cries:  Cool story Kansan happy finally mandated. limited public exposure since March, time gone store staff worn masks. received dirty looks people talk behind back everywhere gone. 

Common sense consideration others rare commodity. True, it’s countries. interesting see end result year two. thank you!   Easy answer. Greed profiteering waste breath. agree. doesn’t mean able enforce stores. It’s dependent owners store—and lot owners aren’t willing risk losing customer even worse, facing kind legal issue.

If store, would enforce no-negotiation rule. Masks only. it’s not. :/ media tell think, tells think about. Wanna see something dystopian? Check out.

That's elegance western media operation, anchors framing issue telling acceptable opinions hold.  correct, appreciate thoughtful reply, NYT's definition hot spot, mine. going said article.

No question Riverside County trouble, along Southern California. think LAT headline bit misleading, implies Riverside County already major COVID hot spot. yet, we're not. pointed another reply (and got downvoted oblivion so) Riverside County ICUs full seeing surge serious non-COVID cases. think might many people afraid see doctor earlier year.

I also feel compelled point look map Riverside County cases are, majority cases western side county. Coachella Valley much better, seen unmasked person public building since early April. ....how supposed eat mask on, though? restaurants really stay carry-out, reopening dining rooms, expected tbh. Even doesn't, personally going gym anytime soon. results study displayed interesting result — 3764 participants, one person caught coronavirus, part group attended gym.

Uh, what? prove anything spread within gym? know sure someone contagious gym tell anything spread environment? Obesity pretty much regular USA... would assign classes based location make work better, too. thought suppose politicize this? I'm prisoner house, love life family. 🤷‍♀️ 

Not able get margaritas make prisoner go YouTube find recipe. dramatic. fucking creativity. kind CDC Adviser know ventilator standard care COVID-19? Partially correct. people also countries history. First think unlikely selfish racist gun toting... likely emigrate. sweet deal US.

But let's say do. agree one country would accept them, right? there's dilution here. obviously make problems go away. (But mask issue: people allowed grocery stores without masks here. enforced. mask food.)

.

So core issues: country gun crazy US country shitty health care system. There's racists ilk everywhere. (I directly descended young earth creationist...) less leverage. People suddenly gun shockingly develop mechanisms deal people express opinions soothe insecurity. 

They also inevitably suffer indignation better health care system. (I major surgery back, anaesthesia, two nights hospital. paid 30 bucks. That's it. I'm benefits. Anybody country would paid even could afford that.)

Generally countries foreigners. Even stay English speaking countries they'll still outsider worst trouble makers often also protected privilege. foreigner inevitably give humbling experience privileged before. 

So even bring worst, people make experiences influence narratives. that's talk potentially vegan new coworker social shame might find previously super acceptable positions. (""My"" young earth creationists never vocal public beliefs.) They'll likely still cause issues bad might think. well new country option sending back ;) love it! never seen subreddit Could people getting infected? cause truth usage masks constant cleaning equipment way stay safe.

This study goes face logic aren’t actually manipulating supply though. new drug hasn’t actually mass produced ever before, almost overnight demand skyrocketed where.

""The timing right, numbers right - hundreds years unforgiving selective pressure sixth 18th

Very interesting stupid question certainly important. explanations are: A) infecting younger folks less likely die B) better medical treatments C) going see deaths spike since lag time deaths new cases (although would thought we'd see something now). 

I hopeful despite rise cases, bringing mortality rate new treatments. important though note death healthy outcomes Covid19. want lung damage health problems associated it. still think need studies range possible health outcomes contracting disease. European here, actually think US centre world. 

What forgetting European countries testing contact tracing regimes quite robust. Local flareups problem, doused amount effort. Likewise, new arrivals infected people handled numbers small.

Besides, simply true say number cases Germany France rising. seen easily 

 caveat Houston Texas open almost 2 months point yet experience surge currently see. personal opinion protests spread covid bars exacerbated problem covid spread like wildfire. Basically, state opened early protest you’re seeing surge new cases. biggest 'cause' figure safe outdoor activities are, since really like see human beings weather currently nice. turns massive outdoor demonstrations led really low (even non-zero) infection rate, information incredibly valuable me. I'm hopeful turn out. rate can't imagine reasonable country would want let us back in. Yeah, good luck that.  Young person federal officials: let fucking stay home work, then. still bills pay put food table. many medical institutions Texas for-profit? also seem understand pandemic would people would stayed home month, active cases resolved. Losing one month economic activity much less harmful economy losing year untamed virus progresses community.

People asking universal mask wearing, minimizing ventures shared indoor public spaces, lockdowns neccessary ones care economy. want prolong epidemic ignorance ones preventing us getting back normal. article starts absolute junk premise one second one word one click. nothing value lost... way office morning Chicago, half people street wearing masks.

Whatever political failings, feel leadership city state level trying strike good balance total isolation totally open economy. I’d bet it’s even worse localities don’t good leadership. Looks like 95% capacity. That’s ok. I’ll block you’re weird af Lol seriously? Gyms? casinos restaurants still open? C'mon. save face. disagree premise BLM slowed corona people scared rioting stayed home. make entire outlook better. got back quarantine started, disable phone. becoming ass people want put energy world. see restricting travel country origin (who disclose numbers idea size original infection base) different someone traveling country (who may stayed airport isolated Wuhan province entirely?) Read article, says people weren’t actively wanting protest stayed home avoid protests resulted social distancing overall. makes sense. Yea, educate me. Show claimed running students washing paste like remains. Please enlight saw Nope That's problem really too. hope person least wore mask.  No, there's lot reposting echo chamber masquerading messaging confusing

The issue giving rise public debate. still many health experts maintain public need wear surgical masks, people countries like China do, cases, could give people false sense security.

Some public health experts say wearing face mask actually causes people touch face more, bad spreading virus.

""I'm side general public wearing masks general rule,"" said microbiologist Kelly Reynolds, professor University Arizona's Mel Enid Zuckerman College Public Health. ""The data support effective broad population.""

One problems universal mask-wearing public could wearing mask prolonged period time, Reynolds said, increase rather decrease chances getting exposed virus. mask may become virus-collecting source infection.

""What actually concentrating virus mask time,"" said. ""You could exposing inadvertently.""

But message public confusing: need surgical mask, health care workers do.

The reason health care workers advantage social distancing, said Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine, medical director disease control Maricopa County Department Public Health.

""We health care workers front lines need masks protect stand right front people actively coughing sneezing very, sick,"" said.

""They care option standing six feet away them. would like preserve masks health care workers. part living community people highest risk getting exposed need protection.""

If unlimited supply masks, Sunenshine said personally would still choose wear one public.

""My daughter, asthma — would wear mask public,"" Sunenshine said. ""I think benefits outweigh discomfort possibility would get contaminated. personal recommendation family."" heard explained factors:

1.) young people getting compared start pandemic, lowers number deaths overall.

2.) Even though don’t firm grasp virus, hospitals understood things better treat symptoms.

3.) could due point two weeks numbers go up, due virus sometimes taking long kill someone.

Regardless, solely look death numbers tell us good bad things going virus. I’m saying that. think need look hospitalizations long term effects people, lung scarring heart problems. get way shocked, shocked tells people get sick die... 19.0% Positive rate go up? Except believe there's companies authorized make now, Gilead even stock it.

There's something fishy article. bad there's way allocate ventilators people wore masks consistently. Here’s article leads 32 year old whose lungs permanently scarred, literally one first google reading history though doubt matter you.

Edit since said “horrible cases”... 2 people 20-29 10 people 30-39 died state covid. Hopefully one works better last one Noooo think wants pandemic get control, come November people able get vote vote mail way, giving excuse cry fraud loses landslide.

How long okay humans treating one another disease vectors avoided? abnormal unhealthy, certainly isn’t life worth living Major mess?

Sweden still twice many positive cases per hour (around 45) New Zealand month (24).

Sweden dreams ""mess"" New Zealand in. Lol what? That’s absurd thing I’ve ever heard Sweden tried continuing grapple higher deaths per million country. said, worst case scenario USA looks like ~66.7% infected. Add 1.5% death rate (assuming consistent conditions massive temporary spikes due infrastructure failure) we’re looking 3 million dead. Better case scenario, 50% infected immunity looking 2 million so. We’re 128k official deaths now. would 10 times number dead died. don’t think people ok ‘solution’. 


Edit: event mortality actually lower (testing issues beginning could’ve inflated death rate) facing 5x already dead. Still rough. man needs shutup already go back rocket.

Sort deflates argument...  That’s I’m confused about, lockdown there’s cure, didnt lockdown order handle second wave? care clayton bigsby, still racist. You’re good, warning folks leave basements sure forcing people get vaccine

right, like poor Brazil choice, especially irresponsible government basically controlling public health. Double good! [Bars, gyms, clubs, pools closed Arizona next 30 announced. rnc 'in public' though.

It buildings, therefore, masks worn.  really think type people anti-mask listen Kanye? Ooof, crazy. people idea coming Fall/Winter. association pediatricians saying thing. see point really address possibility children infecting parents. orphaned child unhappy child, IMHO.

It would useful, think, recommended kids wear masks school also gave suggestions mitigate possible spread school bathrooms. thought “follow science sub” /s *""Unions representing 65,000 Las Vegas-area casino workers accused resort operators Monday putting employees risk illness death coronavirus pandemic skimping safety measures like requirement mask-wearing. ""*

This companies pushing Congress (i.e. McConnell) ""blanket Immunity"". want whatever makes customers happy; even puts employees danger. Perhaps virus teach us unsanitary many aspects life already were, permanently implement measures even COVID-19. i.e. masks restaraunt kitchens. Great job, airlines. selected hub cities high-risk areas
* Houston: United hub
* Dallas: American hub
* Phoenix: American hub
* Miami: American hub (though mainly central/South American Caribbean connections) dont wash hands shitting.. Yeah right, killed half million people last 4 months, total nothingburger right? Restaurants still open meaning thr bars stay open technically still serve food. dodnt know movie theaters water parks open begin with. Churches still public gatherings. going nothing. top replies tweet “it’s fake make trump look bad;” “we revolt, there’s choice;” “all businesses defy order add surcharge bill pay fines legal fees.”

What actual hell wrong people.  even get from? reason test Brazil high enough active amount virus get real data back, sure forcing people get vaccine Ye. ate restaurant last Thursday, empty normal lunch rush. think best way say it, gone state indoor crowds allowed vaccine. lost mate take L Leard code, dude. Lol MA. Said fuck went full super buzzed sometimes completely shaved route. though, I’m aware life going different quite bit figured may well embrace now. It’s ideal yet another one small sacrifices make safety others well, honestly don’t hate new look FDA approved rescinded dangerous ineffective drug used. Brazilian government gladly still pushes it. 

Brazil would last place use humans guinea pigs trial. Oh yes let us IGNORE Massive amounts protests completely disregard social distancing mass social gatherings. Screw that, New Jersey explain massive death made Elderly COVID-19 hotspots nursing homes!! Check r/beermoney earn spending money. I’m 25 living parents health issues barely work experience 2 years chances finding job anytime soon, beermoney least spending money cooking hobby. make $200/month minimal effort Huge point. I've actually thought problem lot different angles. used rent lot years... saved bought place.. realized much darn work money goes home. Two years ago got laid off, started property business. one house rented out. would LOVE sell someone original goal shit hit fan. So.. I've lot sides whole thing.. really can't see good solutions UBI companies allowing remote work people live cheap. 


I'm sure it'll make people sick here.. live.. I'm renting 1000sqft brick home next door park.. 3 car garage $600/month. that's fair rate. Maybe places apartments $2500/month.. priced way there's people willing pay LONG due correction? CA DC.. looking guys.  long time. 

Thanks posting me. mean excluding homeschool folks think near unanimous agreement in-person school vital kids development- keeping kids school nightmare everyone dont bunch spare teachers going around hospitalize 20% ones inescapable problem. going staggering amount closures industry think.

if NFL crowds, probably bars open either. Nah, China little bit pretty obvious severe could get taken seriously then. late.

Yet world still shrugging minor concern... lock everyone homes next year Anything churches? still allowed open? I've never thought US world leader begin with. Sure, they're powerful, but... Leader sense? Stupidity? War? Obesity? TIL.

It's cool different different parts America really are. Yeah protests riots hurt all... mean Chaz/chop shut 7 blocks extorted people month.

BUT lets get that. Registered Nurse patient attacked told hospital policy wear mask. pinched, kicked, verbally attacked me. managed avoid kicks punches, able scratch break skin wrist. get labs drawn hepatitis HIV (so patient). course moving avoid punches, tore ACL. knee twice size painful. patient kept screaming even real nurse, actress pretending nurse. People serious defiance wearing masks. careful there, guys. live California? going arresting anyone, lol. Ffs xi jiping, someone who’s leading surveillance state, shit job managing health standards country understand it, supposed enter mask keep eat.

I mean shit idiots even want that. me, I'm going sit restaurant vaccine get it. probanly need fertilize cut plants back. putting energy growing vines fruit. YouTube really helpful. haven’t, delta removed middle seats cabin. I’m arguing saying suggesting already moved action. see. Thank you. Japan farming large scale like describe believe. could wrong

However, many foods imported probably fit description. saying people scientists? criterion ""worst case scenario"", would possibly justify 2 meter rule (3 would better, 4 even better, ... guess what, 5 better that)? point point say X meters results acceptable risk. decided 1 meter results acceptable risk. realise tradeoff. example, could class fitting classroom 1 meter rule, 2 meter rule, now, 2 meter rule, split class teach two sections, means professor exposed, better? point here, complex problem, scientists disagree on. losing parent vs falling behind maths? question would lead worse outcomes children. rushed reopen businesses horrific mistake, cautious rushing reopen schools, especially pandemic getting worse better. true. Yea another thing times set oven 200 leave food (take container everything) santize it, we're completely sure well worked. also tended dry things little much. also said, 2008, economy sound incoming collapse caused fraudulent securities ratings. Sounds like 80s song.. weird article posted says:

“The 14 countries lifted travel ban include: Australia, Canada, Japan, Algeria, Georgia, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, according Reuters report Tuesday.

The United States China, meanwhile, included EU's ""safe"" travel list, report said.”

Weird. terms worsepandemic, knows? terms 21st century precarious time full chaos turmoil, yes.

We sooo many issues species, climate, socially, economically ect. never going easy century. say thing. Around Oakland people popping fireworks couple weeks lol. terrifying. it’s meant happen design healthcare system, runs business. Absolutely horrible. 
The information there, one wants talk elephant room. too. know sub doesn’t like admit it, appear mortality decreasing bit already. Doctors already improved treatment protocols past three months, get better here. don’t get vaccine though, quite boned. Thankfully many candidates Fauci says it’s matter “when” “if”. responded equally fact-less comment??? one ever said society would collapse, you... Source? posted breakdown/schedule know would really great idiot currently president would consider stopping fantastic events perhaps instead stay White House job once. Maybe make national mask mandate something else actually stop spread nasty illness instead perpetuating large attendance events. got go. Enough enough need ensure goes come Election Day. can’t afford keep someone reckless disregard human lives. DingDingDing. winner. South Arizona. big problem right know anyone saw coming (we have). southern U.S. inside/air-conditioning capital world. amazing rare full-building A/C everwhere except U.S. gulf oil kingdoms. don’t understand you’re point regarding this. Don’t want top 25% re-engage consumer activity? Doesn’t benefit everyone? tried get test March (not Florida) couldn't' lack testing. criteria pretty strict, (hospitalization) one thing would qualified test even 60 years old. stop eating wild animals ground fucking **food** People need view economic standpoint . people anti mask also protesting open everything . health explanation simply worked particular crowd. Tell ruin economy maybe listen . I’m demanding people risk lives, I’m acknowledging reality that’s what’s likely happen based what’s happened last months. Demanding government anything pointless don’t bother. demanding people give entire lives livelihoods? Nah, war drugs failure itself. Drugs need legalized. They've definitely tried SARS-CoV-2 infect pigs. 
As soon something like comes out, race find model species test vaccines treatments. far fruit bats, mink, human/non-human primates  wholesome Sadly, wife roommate likely exposed now. we’ll see goes. we’re fairly healthy people, we’ll ride out.

If always 20% extra space hospital, means fucked built hospital big expensive.

The news runs headlines like ""90% capacity reached hospital!"" without giving context kind numbers totally normal. I’m you, upvoted posts. blew mind badly botched early messaging regarding masks deter panic buying protect hospital PPE. still people circulating old CDC statements proof masks aren’t effective...

They could told us truth. *CSU Airlines packing cabins full...thats distancing people smooshed together 18"" wide seats.   went raised beds 12 raised beds gardened hearts out!! quite rewarding.

It’s heartbreaking don’t know tell her..

We bit Philosophical talk family..

At point think humans reach “sweet spot”? mean, point accept humans die it’s cycle life ever stop reach 0 cases *anything*? There’s fine balance quality life longevity. think stop signs residential areas kids likely playing ridiculous? Well, guess see kind intelligence level I'm dealing here. think would helpful sides fence cooperate other. virus going impact economy.  recent behavior? article draw smart conclusion applies everyone? That’s official store all. Thanks info!! perfectly summarizes feel. doesn’t nothing. simple compromises opening would go long way no.... people can’t bothered wear mask exhibit common sense we. Yet again. It’s maddening. oh, pricing drugs based upon patient would paid treatment? I’m expert things, feel like positive rate per test much bigger deal total number new cases. may give much better depiction prevalent given area. New cases trickled slightly areas like NY NJ drop positive rate much substantial. rough math tracker. NY, one eight tests come back positive since start testing. That’s less 1 100 now. Florida 1 6 moment. Thing is, bars restaurants people *spending* money. Parties, crowded public places... people forced work due financial shackles. crowds due privileged people simply give flying fuck.

I blame anyone forced go work due financial situation. might blame employers someone chain forcing happen. people crowding restaurants bars? People throwing giant house parties? real idiots deserve sympathy. highly contagious didn’t everyone mom catch already?

Because months lockdown. weeks we’ve reopen, many counties states ignoring well way so. Bullshit. Political backlash means nothing compared hundreds thousands deaths. Anyone spineless risk job save thousands lives deserve job. think end year, bars clubs open, sports back, humans meant do: socially interact. Unemployment 30mlion people. Theres 330 million people. Only.like 15% population lost jobs already do. That’s one part it; there’s also terrifying feeling bring home give loved ones. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, median age positive Covid-19 cases March 65 years old. within last week, dropped 35 years old.

...because March mostly testing older people. stat tells us nothing. Damn worked small lodge type places although also feel crying tip, told slow stretch work out. Absolutely “spray wipe” allowed, full wash water only. usually spent end day waiting dryers smoking weed behind laundry room (I worked 2 places, both)

it's difficult concept. almost like willfully ignoring try score political points.  Tellem. mask protects me. Thats bad packaging, bad leadership bad counter-narrative flu. need bring population rational counter-intuitive behavior slowly people adjust.

Lol. tipping order booze? reject refills? states legal requirement serve water. Surely considering beyond refill water? mean, that's legal requirement.

No, im cheap. tip better accepted standards unless put gratuity automatically. think tipping ridiculous practice. mean it. different stop signs residential areas.

Also, no, dont ask produce clerks that, people do. example minimum wage employee going beyond.

Listen, mate, argument obvious logical flaws point going say ""No, free refills actually mean servers supposed give free refills."" Like, come on, expectation tip server even thry going beyond. Thry job, get tipped. laughable arguing refilling drinks beyond.  someone shot asking others wear comments dont wear masks shot

The irony palpable. literally bad person shot someone masks. ditto VA - going phase 3 week beyond stupid averaging 500 cases day little spikes around urban areas. ready level stupid people proper things keeping front them. Lol

However, ask they'd rather run burning fire wrapped wet towel bare-ass naked, people prefer wet towel think second. No, going 100% stop burning death laboratory setting, may give enough protection make it. feel same. won’t believe many social invites I’ve turned couple couldn’t. Many kitchens pay base +tip back house. 10 kitchens I've worked in, 1 that. That's reform talking about.

Let’s chat anti-Vaxxers year.... people wear masks countdown.... 4,3, 2,1 Yes, remain open. saw guy wearing skull mask day. looked plenty manly. fact, looked frightening. first all, effectively suppress corona virus area country, otherwise could've much worse along flood. Second, although horrible flood, way described like national catastrophe much. I'm Houstonian, went Ike Harvey. Yes, horrible experience, expecting something like overturn country makes sense. I'm currently worried hurricane hit Houston again, doomed could new epic center COVID19. Portnoy you?? attest. Illinois people weirdly, almost startlingly asocial... 

Memorial Day? Meh. went family things. Social distance. Things open yet.

Since then, compliance masks declining populace becomes complacent. idiot town let kids unofficial prom.... Predictably, cases blossomed little hay day there's several businesses town shutdown.

4th July, bars opening full tilt.... gonna toss up. I'm betting noncompliance, mixed holiday spirits spark cases. However, estimate Midwest asocialism. Pinellas co*Florida masked pretty well finally........
However everything open people pretty much traded masks social distancing point. people taking seriously young adults part won’t enforce it. Nobody enforces it. 

We going pay hubris. boss is, though. Besides Vaccine deniers one would refuse it, except going cost 2400$ F would go would brankrupt families... I'm condoning China really kept data getting out, I'm saying that, given saw, think would've changed much, Italy pretty open dire situation was, whole World knew point, yet many Countries take action virus hit them, still taking proper action, even Italy timid measures first. Good points, current states escalating case numbers make significant changes really see flatten curve... food thought. read due volume air box retailers grocery stores plus lack opportunity long exposure times potentially infected individuals. office movie theater restaurant, though, spot near individuals hours end, potentially. people see crossfit games crossfit get shape crossfit games. right feel. going order $16 appetizer $60 steak Saturday dinner $8 side mashed potatoes? local spot still pretty decently it’s 1/3 price, lose atmosphere I’m going paying inflated costs associated it.

Lucky me, high end restaurants realized nobody going paying full price eat food home, it’s restaurants never even take delivery before, created new menus much reasonable. course; local steakhouse changed nothing, NY Strip still $68 la carte. 

You know today? bought whole cooked chicken large side potatoes $10. already fed lunch, dinner, I’ll make chicken salad leftovers lunch tomorrow, I’m going make chicken stock bones. That’s pretty much 2 days meals $10. 

It blows mind this, unusual spend $200-$300 Friday Saturday night dinners bars. finally free this, I’m sure I’ll able go back. maybe wouldn’t many medical workers still alive. 

Considering idiotic Americans are, think made right call. probably depends store. I've kind thing like 4 years stores run great much. I've actually loving many stores making option LA county one populous counties nation. Comparing infection ratios case fatality ratios still much better Europe en masse. failure? may happen NV too... area work surrounded bars packed full little social distancing PPE. Aka every gym. There's nothing ok going gym right anyone household  I'm commenting validity either statement, /u/snewod literally latest rumblings masks provide personal protection, protection others.

And completely ignored part reason said protect others, yourself.

Again, I'm commenting validity either statement, pointing reply ignores main point post replying to. virus burning literally alternative guy. Yeah shit. think anybody half brain would believe .006% population COVID-19. mah freedom Americans truly goldfish memories. used think applied inability keep track politicians' scandals failure punish accordingly polls. realize applies things fundamental safety precautions needed stay alive pandemic. many Americans really fucking dumb forgetful. True, even shortish incubation period, say ~5 days(?), followed death within say another ~7 days(?), plenty time virus high mortality rate be. 

It's right blend incubation period/symptomatic time/mortality rate. that's hard predict, even viruses mutated time time again.

Not saying case swine flu, possible potentially mutate create perfect storm speak. playing devil's advocate mostly! blame them, though? People shot lot things. Doesn’t afraid. odds vaccine hitting market significant risk death zero.

That definitely correct. Vaccines take years observation high risk, less healthy populations. usually do.

It's know, example, Yellow Fever Vaccine produce allergic reaction people severe egg allergies. vaccines use egg proteins trigger reaction end reaction. 

The MMR vaccine cause fever seizures. Thankfully rare. However, know risk protect high risk populations research. 

This research cannot expedited novel virus. 

[Here's good article Scientific goal close universal vacation safely possible. this, need know vaccine safe. know yet. need able convince others safe. bother mention information before,

You're entitled life story. jerk busy trying attack strangers, never occurred may good valid reasons. Properly worn masks big help protecting everyone wearer, slightly help wearer. Medical staff mainly wear pass one patient next guard liquid splashes. worn personal protection part whole kit including eye protection, face masks, gloves, scrubs, etc. changed regularly. 

Some dipshit goes rally going wear mask probably wear correctly care, making person's wearing mask almost useless. 

General mask usage works everyone wears mask. show data says not. ive seen one economics professors 'study' wasnt scientific all. really aren’t!! videos people posted unbelievable. would scared hell right worked food service retail enforce mask policy safety safety co-workers  Doctors saying need masks: sleep


Some bank destroyed world economy says need masks: real shit  I’ve seen lot too, people swing conspiracy conspiracy deny things. never acknowledge wrong are, think super smart.

Crazy. recomending bad behaviour though. get want blame Tegnell FHM everything, pretty sure idiots idiots way Tegnell CO became talking point Sweden. Even masks part official strategy nothing stopping people using them. people hating people masks simply idiots.

Edit: loving downvotes though. agree health professional even want vaccine. why: oxford vaccine still asymptomatic carrier spread it, aka false sense security. Besides also face two worst scenarios: likely most/earliest exposed people (I infected early May, gf (a doc) too) vaccine probably going mandatory us.
The real priority elderly people comorbidities risk dying getting extremely sick covid outweighs risk side effects vaccine. Ok well doesn’t matter believe facts show they’re clearly wrong...sorry man. it’s highly contagious exactly explain exponential growth explosion cases areas taking thing joke right now? Yep. sure you’re getting downvoted. 100% correct. Fauci admitted much testimony saying stockpiles PPE HCW. So, instead coming big campaign get cloth masks ground grassroots level, purposefully lied. Can’t really blame people trusting that. I’m huge mask proponent said day 1 mixed messaging masks huge mistake. came WHO, CDC, Surgeon General, Fauci, TV doctors. It’s pretty unforgivable honest. Plenty. HIV HBV entirely controllable medication. HCV meds recently invented fully clear virus body. Herpesviruses also really nifty antivirals.

I don’t think there’s precedent COVID. I’ve never seen much scientific community mobilize behind single virus like this. It’s already deadly healthy young people; vaccine treatment lessen severity bad cold, even treatment can’t fully eliminate virus, could probably go back normalcy. However, months away least, need trying keep virus low possible then.  There's something abnormally terrible administration...

It's lives humans really matter them. thinking terms infected people per day. Way think binary terms. 

Pot. Kettle. Black. virus situation match own. 

Give couple months. We'll see pans out. object, carry object? many work car accidents (this also includs less people getting hit cars) everyone back normal life.

True, numbers small. 50 people / week die UK car accidents typically. Even halving saving 25 lives / week. Whereas Coronavirus deaths close 1000 / week. Homicide similarly 10 / week typically. doesn’t work well young kids. They’re missing important developmental learning time. according webmd, numbers regarding ventillators general. seems like 40-50% mortality rate regardless condition, says death rate covid ran 21% 88% utilizing That's responsive said.

The CDC knew going recommend masks started. whole Western world shrugged Asia's experience masks ""eh, people think helps, proven does."" calculated decision ""we need save PPE healthworkers."" so-called ""greatest country world"" destroyed single pandemic Dang, realize SC hospitalizations per capita level TX Well mean seen stupid average American is...  That's means, means ""Hey, spending 20 min line get tiny shot cut chance contracting Covid half."" know I'll fucking jump that. might enough get better vaccine without ending permanent respiratory damage. normal times doctors often ""make call"". Come visit loved one. Nobody says it, everyone knows. likely going last time get speak them.

In pandemic times like this, triage means, ""let us help take loved one die peace, home"". What's said is, ""this frees bed someone might survive"". figured considerably ignorant. spelling aside I'm still convinced simple, narrow minded, dumbass opinion like that. Since know determine public setting it, reduce stress behaving everyone it. Dogs cannot get Covid, unlike cats. much risk. 5% roll eyes news reports, take scientist figure out. bit late reports come out. came earlier people followed, crazy number cases everyday. think smarter everyone else reality polar opposite. probably won’t immediate available people health risks. think go healthy people first spread there. Probably military first guess. People give shit, just.. Americans inexplicable reason. Back March, thought Spain poor job locking late, getting tens thousands deaths!... now, I'm really damn glad live actually sensible country took harsh measures stop pandemic. Spain almost COVID19 free today. 

My deepest condolences Americans actually care go this. Unfortunately little individuals stem tides pandemic -- much issue government society handle. guess that's issue right there... It’s unlikely first vaccine US, would highly regarded British company elite British university working American government perform ethnic cleansing? That’s ridiculous argument way past containment. would needed total lockdown grounding air travel early mid-February latest. Lockdown would least month, two, would barred domestic travel anything essential services emergencies.

The lockdowns attempt flatten curve. hindsight would ideally steady new case count time overwhelm hospitals. lockdown/reopen dynamic silly counterproductive. need everyone masks reopen good. Exactly. almost like want us absolutely miserable. wonder number conspiracy theories? 

Also, remember pulled emotional bullcrap 9-11. 

Why take money used godawful commercials use help people put instead.

In words, put shut up! someone explain case numbers rising weeks death toll remaining low hundreds per day? I'm referring United States, something helping save lives? virus somehow strong months ago? What's different? really huge fan Meemaw, wearing mask save local Dairy Queen I'm side effects huh? still using rats overly elongated telomeres studies? Panhandle Florida basically mask-less. made national news city one counties made mask wearing inside businesses mandatory. held special meeting board reversed mayors decision. Maybe 5% people wearing masks, that's good day. Oh also ton tourists 4th. keep coming here. Insane. Eh keep family only. Twice week look see everyone's family wall.
 groups, liked pages etc etc. cool look family since like congregate there, especially times. Yes...but ""The *right* people.""  also pretty wrong developing test threatening others like University Washington.  Surely true: that's welders always dying young? point trying make exactly, report individuals' experiences?

I issue reporting, issue headline. 

""Sweden's foreign residents reveal abuse"" clearly exaggeration article reports, interview handful people. hypothetical, lost job, 10k debt, landlord evict me, asking more? immune! still asking more!

How ask anyone sacrifice more, even tiny? 99% people never know infected. need lose jobs, lives, livelihoods diabetics obese people?  mom nurse good sized hospital. definitely want ventilator. stops body's ability expell virus sceptic particles gotten lungs wearing face mask. GL everyone. Remember choose God's government Man's.. surely cross roads would want job. unfortunately facing catch 22, regardless says half us ignore great American culling. misspelled twenty billion. good mom pop restaurants food travels well eaten hand bang business area. Good not, chain not, rest seem much business all. competence leadership New York state significant multiple confirmed cases anywhere else country?

Is W.H.O. ""competent""? that's lose/lose question answer, I'm sorry. identify organizations responsible act China Trump responsible for?

in comparing Ebola reaction, remember China wanting admit degree impact virus origin regions, letting American doctors scientists much access. media even. saw saw thanks dissidents smugle footage information. Corn &amp; Corona Could someone proficient math describe what/how much 5% hit would amount to? *want* things escalate cancel/delay election process. Trump tanking polls desperately looking way retain power. countries idiot leader. survive really bad shape rest life.

Although outcome extremely rare. US huge, horrible history human experimentation vaccines. claim they're safe people line up.

And trust POTUS big human rights advocate. I've worked public facing jobs enough years know people idiots unfortunately. People good enough avoid obvious dangers like putting hands hot stove live society people *still* smoke well know kinds negative health outcomes.  would make sense older people started became widely known smoking caused cancer plenty younger people start smoking. Why? people general complete idiots comes threats can't immediately see. covid something people got immediately bled public soon got it, it'd different. Instead, get exposed get sick 'til 4-5 days later. People process threat well. Source 30k euro jail please. no, even true, same, fail understand basic principle human right, long way go understanding democracy. I'm normally enthusiastic vaccine supporter.

I'm betting FDA approve syringe full dirty water presented review election day.

I'm taking vaccine unless also approved EU. Lol. :) loot whole country anytime want, could surely get us wear masks. think point unless know someone specific spent time with, would know? least international travel restricted higher chance contained? money lives disgusting matter excuse try use.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Haha, oh boy. regret alright, think. don’t really follow stuff, many new cases see daily now? Better vote then. still ~1/3 population blindly devoted him

And them. voting propose enforce this? know whose going state? track people? Today's press conference: runner, good stress 99.3% US diagnosed assume everyone it? rate higher even every man/woman, child already infected (hint, been).

Nooo ... vast majority ""man women children"" wouldnt dying Covid.

And *enough* didnt die, possible Infection Fatality Rate would actually decrease 0.2%.

The IFRs looking right NYC Lombardy largely affected huge outbreaks seniors homes areas, death rates worst environments. last simulation actually 2-3 months coronavirus. Check “Event 201”. Well said. piece shit here, you. Remember that. need spell correctly, english fourth language, really give shit it. Lmao cannot believe much page fear mongers Checking mall Glendale Arizona here. Glendale part Phoenix. Arrowhead mall. Everyone wearing masks. lot people too. Good see everyone masked here. lot people buying food local shops food court. Lots social distance. Things look good terms people taking seriously. really good see you, especially Phoenix. Looks like crisis might put vaccine responsibility front center. Europe exact position Sweden 3 months ago - facing 'pandemic' without immunity.

Way think binary terms. thinking terms infected people per day. Sweden obviously completely different epidemiologic situation European countries right now. There's reason many countries accepting Swedish tourists yet – virus situation match own. go back look exact wording, I’ve always taken mean “For United States, wearing mask right won’t much stop spread, cases we’re seeing imported outbreaks elsewhere.”

For second point, sorta look deal terrorists. don’t need reason discount scientific opinion expert advice (coming someone constantly argue anti-vaxxer family members). give point use, oh better believe they’ll run it. failing that, they’ll find different reason elsewhere.

My biggest gripe administration normalizing “tough guy” approach simple measures like wearing mask, social distancing, maybe sacrificing creature comforts. People see president flaunting experts don’t feel though should. It’s infuriating argue FAVOR keeping everyone safe, are.

To honest, I’m glad I’m healthcare directly. don’t enough sympathy people point, wouldn’t mind “own goals” that’s took people stop acting like god damn children. understand concern. took necessary precautions tested quarantined before. I'd probably go detail flaws behind comments. I'll leave at, virus going spread regardless. Cheers, hope stay safe. Nobody happy happening.

EDIT Grammer, spelling, wording ""mask protect you"" get fucking face shield then... 3M 8825 FFP2/3 masks comfortable. they're sold anywhere anymore. thus everyone wore masks, everyone would less likely contract virus would people downvote another person's personal experience? make sense either - think anyone would happy hear every hospital running capacity. thanks sharing info, different Kaiser friend's. File complaint practice take business elsewhere. incredibly unprofessional behavior work clients. feel like maybe Italy explain governors shutdown means. (serious) question comments deaths lagging indicator deaths confirmed cases 3 weeks ago? Deaths still declining cases increasing started around early June. understand anyone thought opening bars good idea. People going bar likely interested social distancing. Even plan initially go out, couple drinks going melt concern away. got take ""girls trip"" Bahamas, resort Mexico, place pay little yell wait staff drunk beach. strictly ""deaths virus"" take account deaths lack hospital resources, full icu's, etc...?

The fallout virus could go well beyond direct deaths causes work local casino Vegas security. can’t go 10 feet without tell guest put mask back on. know rules. try find loophole wear take back soon think one watching. Getting tested hard enough getting retested numbers rising every day would next level...unless you’re billionaire, politician, pro athlete celeb. SMFH... hurts fell that?

Russia?

Again?

I'm sorry. Dump Trump...

I'm fan he's opponent, even 18 year old would listen advice better trump. doubt going kill 20 people without wearing mask.

If know infected deliberately trying give others, yeah, need locked contagious. I'm gonna die disease coming spit, yeah, that's life death.

But literally scenario justifies it.

I'm asking seriously now: saw someone public without mask, gun put hand, would punished actions, would shoot them? look results current studies, also plan get right away Fauci charge. Muh freedumbz! Snowflake liberal hoax. True aristocrat. ""If dies, dies"" Chiropractor this. visits $80.00 pocket. pay $20.00 use insurance. Chiro billing sorts services occurring visit insurance started refuse pay. told insurance, ""I'm paying this...my visit's $80.00 pocket perform this, that, thing listed."" Chiropractor told me, ""if insurance pay responsible billed."" responded Chiro, ""If pocket rate $80.00 per visit routine adjustment, billing this, that, thing? services performed getting penny me."" ""well send collections"" response. ""well, I'll see court mine."" 

&amp;#x200B;

That ended that. I'm weak-minded psychotropic drugs like youself. really get drugs, get job, move helicopter parents. need live reality learn deal life. Stop blaming others poor choices. mask usage appears high photos I’ve seen.

well case closed then! Also, one person doesnt mask coughs, could easily get masked persons eyes.

All takes one person without mask infect hundreds people. gets downvoted shared mild experience...

BTW- entire house roommates got it. 5 us. one us got actually sick, everyone else mild symptoms. Could gone work completely fine wasn’t contagious lose apartment cause can't make rent? Yeah noticed myself.. Maybe seeing drop daily deaths shutdown it’s taking number go back up? would indicate initial infections way higher first thought think assume next lie  hospitals get overwhelmed, see deaths surging also. #Oxymeter panic averted

If using oximeter check whether caught virus, start get alarming numbers -- *check batteries*.

I getting readings 90 91, really alarming, bought second oximeter pharmacy. new one gave 97, fine. 

Then replaced crappy batteries came first model -- two quite (not perfectly) consistent.  didn’t want say wear mask beginning low supplies &amp; knew people would panic &amp; buy supplies. fuck think people would take virus seriously fucking open everything like nothing wrong? define control? know car best analogy Thus proving OP's original post... I've got bad feeling Excerpt: 
At Kepler University Hospital (Linz/Austria), drug Covid-19 developed Innviertler researcher Josef Penninger tested. experience this?

The Penninger drug potential prevent severe lung damage, potential there. However, yet able give serious assessment, four patients treated it, Austria twelve. far experienced negative side effects four six patients treated drug already able leave hospital. moment, used later, patients older, concomitant diseases show clear symptoms low oxygen saturation. However, aim would administer preventively wider group patients order avoid lung damage. present, however, administer severe cases risks known yet. think children income level work supported way.

Further, wander around outside day. realize parents kids age 8 care options work let kids house. level, reminds younger days grew up. But, kids SIP, think otherwise demonstrates much paying attention. started schools went DL started take parents realized DL complete joke. People comply march break, highly doubt they'll give fuck 4th july. ABOARD COVID TRAIN! CHOO CHOO MOTHERF**KER!

We need get Samuel L. Jackson say somehow. Deaths seem decreasing they're quick throw people ventilators. month, numbers deaths gone down, based current data. 

Feb/Mar: 5201 deaths 

April: 61843 deaths 

May: 41914 deaths 

June: 20257 deaths (this number likely go rest states report.) 1) age people testing positive gone down. However, know relative median age people contracted virus, since said, testing skewed towards older people originally. 

So know information.

2) reported deaths trail 4-5 weeks, depending location (Florida still recording new deaths end April early May!) instead demanding government job, demanding working class get back work risk lives.

Why demanding people forced risk lives paycheck instead demanding government job? Sure, I'd happy done correctly first time, chose to, are. 

At beginning, discussion locking 4-5 weeks,allowing infected become ill seek treatment isolate others. handle it, fuck 'em. Everyone manipulated modeling. arguing masks see others arguing masks gives license whine. care data all, though? Trust me, I’m sure you’ll die comment. that’s beauty karma haha. You’ve essentially intertwined life mine ruined karma haha haha.

I hope you’re superstitious. Try walk around back mind rest life haha.

I bet didn’t think going go direction huh? 

I bet superstitious buddy haha! Goldman Sachs said mask mandate would save 5% economy. one it? Maybe high death rate states reporting? pretty ridiculous population equates stonks good economy fucking poor stonks. said multiple presidencies- voted for, not- Stonks unemployment rate bullshit manipulated numbers. think give people card exempting them, card, sign afidavit members household given last priority hospitals. Also, fact they’ve signed shared insurance company. indeed believe see it. Even working vaccine today, look testing still struggling. supply distribution chains needed distribute this.

Then fact botching much already, convincing population take it. 

I mean sure hope time line good. I’m going guess ‘widely available’ going apply people government Fortune 500. mah margaritas! /s  I'm DC suburbs Virginia. make run local grocery store today, thing avoid absolutely necessary. mandatory mask rule statewide here, happy say every single patron grocery store well every single employee masked up. reasonably busy, like five people there.

My latest mask cats it. love cats. :-) produce section picking kale elderly gentleman probably 8 ft wearing cloth mask dogs it. looked said, ""I hope masks get fight."" took second, could tell eyes crinkled smiling underneath mask.

This much needed moment mask lightness day. They've developing vaccine years virus discovered 6 months ago? idea Oxford procognitives staff.

In reality, Oxford chose use existing vaccine technology developed chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine vector (ChAdOx1) suitable vaccine technology to use deliver vaccine developed. They've also used data incomplete development SARS MERS vaccines help accelerate development SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. obviously **not** working SARS-CoV-2 vaccine longer known exist. Partly, positive percentage goes also big screwed cost make one dose isn’t issue. need make *millions* doses distribute them. drug mass produced before, going lot costs associated scaling like super short time frame. 9501 demanding people risk lives instead demanding government job? way schools opening. Seems careless. Balkans.  know people already decided going get vaccine right away trust it.

These people wear mask they're afraid getting CO2 poisoning. lifelong lesson them. Sadly affect others themselves. I'm compassion willing risk others lives cling lies misinformation would say let get stoped infect others everything could avoid afford give job grocery store medical workers willing give trying save lives pay price too. Lack sufficient medical treatment would contributing cause hypothetical auto accident. COVID kill you, lack care did.  concur. call redneck riviera reason. Good banh mi one things miss living Atlanta. Get Vietnamese ice coffee, sweet hut milk tea, I’m happy day long. Bartendere here. absolutely correct agree think bars still need closed. feel like I've seen absolute dredges society since we've opened. Bartenders used stress, high stress job already, felt exponentially worse lately. want anyone us able go back normal enjoy job again, I'm dense try return normal sooner should. I'm terrified go work environment. I'm suggesting New York level numbers, least consistent death rates country world. Somewhere vicinity 7,000 would normal rate death, they're 2,400.

Florida, documented history attempting under-report numbers, higher death rate Texas. saying is, makes sense different rules different population densities lot countries EU didn’t reopen borders. apprciate give take. Nice intelligent conversation yeah traveling living around world confirms yes flawed little dysfunctional. hate current state country gotta tell ya, little pissed twisting constitution laws spent 20 years defending. vaccine months learned bunch new shit bound happen. actually surprising portion population believe masks here. work said used came states access nice gyms yet, idea about.

You must amazing physical specimen impossible figure work home.

It sound like trying insist working general health. pandemic dude, time adult accept fact need making sacrifices. single point made backed scientific studies.

ive asked link 3 times, point, trolling willfully ignorant don’t know basic things.

you mean basic talking I’ll glad dig one showing high mask usage protests, like, it’s common knowledge 

Neat, takes ^**one** person infect hundreds mask wearing show something like that, done, I’ll assume you’re arguing bad faith.

likewise, keep making claims heard news somehwere arent able link source.

good day sir. Seriously. local news reminded people heat stroke last night weather update. admire optimism.

When go people wearing masks? Texas stopped reporting icu capacity. Worldometers takes time aggregate all.

The Texas department health pretty good job updating daily county totals (doesn't show county change, could figured out) whereas worldometers county changes looking county announcements. Oftentimes county announcements significantly expedient state total update around 4 pm day. Well, ya, driving without seatbelt fine too. Till not. literally said anecdotal. He’s saying he’s doctor. benefits vitamin around awhile, heard March doesn’t mean one else Thanks! Vaccines aren’t 100% effective people can’t get due medical reasons. addition, concerns long term health sequelae otherwise healthy people get COVID 19. virus deadly enough that.

The likely scenario: They'll get it. They'll lucky get mildly, going make view ""it's flu bro"" even stronger. expected nothing you’re still let also, cite countries superior leadership looking death rates? (per million)

Ireland: 360, increase flattening, later timeline exposure

United States: 380, still increasing, later timeline exposure

Italy: 560, increase flattening

Spain: 600, increase flattened

United Kingdom: 640, still increasing

Belgium: 840, increase flattening

There's shuttered hospital planned open surge capacity, though sure yet. Maybe somehow get one USNS hospital ships Arizona.  I'm sure that's true, data support idea people getting sick result.

If people infected takeout, we'd see lot clusters of, example, bunch people getting sick getting takeout restaurant. We're seeing that, even countries good contact tracing.

New Jerseyan here. wait indoor dining. Dumbasses boozing shore filling ICU’s worth it. doesn’t wind outside spread droplets even partially easy inside ? 

Outside 10 ft constantly touted virtually bulletproof. ? terms percentages total currently infected. you. Keep clean! done two workouts far made feel amazing. mental stimulus can’t possible measured. gym one primary forms stress relief didn’t realize much shit internalizing able work out. Yes, one study showed 67% asymptomatic damage one lung 33% damage lungs. 

The asymptomatic contagious contagious longer. neighbors 70+ retirees don’t give fuck. They’re still going shop eat. One isn’t wearing mask despite diabetes. think numbers faked government we’ll end anyway. Oxford team got concerned numbers dwindling UK.

Again, 300K almost 1k new cases day enough study. overall, country 330,000,000 many. wait, Georgia stance nothing didn’t work? grandpa die COVID know real.

Anyone Georgia continues vote person “little yellow bus” special. dawgs never smart... opinion test us live NJ, reason say ""See, can't reopen indoor dining yet, since one follow basic rules"" Stocks “the economy”. disproportionately owned richest Americans. Thanks reply, reassuring. feel selfish extremely panicked I've even brief encounters anyone others working grocery stores front line jobs this. I'm starting Cognitive Behavioral Therapy tomorrow hope helps. Sucks got downvoted, I'm guessing renting commercial residence? “Knuckle heads” gov. think people going tell it’s okay go bars? They’re going go bars. gov. plan rhyme reason 
 said fucking moron? Yeah said. got first one ebay 20 bucks market price. Second one got ebay needed lower weight. two got Rep Fitness someone r/kettlebells posts they're sale. pretty random point, try buy think I'll need road get stronger. \


The early days 1-200 dollar markup seem behind us, gotta keep lookout sign store mailing lists. going long time housing bubble popping too. Beats nobody did. fuck done since virus started? Nothing. 

Lol. literally developed response countries using slow spread virus order collapse healthcare systems. response enabled US states contain virus. 

What expect do? job gather data, analyze it, recommend policy. sit day day say boring stuff politicians listen it. job implement anything.

Remember, US/CDC sitting ass nothing, marching forward team ground China, research, gathering diseminating information, developing policy, generally warning world. Like declaring emergency political nasayers conned people thinking fake. Sorry deleted comment. know many people dying coronavirus. don’t guess. test fellow citizens? seems exploitation poor Brazil. Almost universally, two weeks. 

Fall spring break one week non-year-round calendars; two weeks year-round.  tells made progress flattening curve everyone decided fuck it, want go shopping. Let educate fact 10.5 million people tested positive 7.9 BILLION. 0.0013% world population grand majority cases nothing positive test symptoms. Add fact grossly high false positive rate tests infection rate let alone death rate let alone rate actually would effect day day life miniscule anyone half hemisphere working brain see risk general public anymore getting flu winter is. may even less threat. Id like see numbers 40% infection rate saying, source, number find credible source 1% 1% population even tested positive let alone even feel effect. may biggest hoax reaction non issue history world. No, ignoring allows grow. could tell people meeting came talking points (probably church pastor encouraged go meeting speak out). 

It's scary people think like this. kept using terms like ""The devil's laws"" ""God's breathing system.""

They obviously listened Sermons recapping angrily public officials. areas infections though. counties country zero deaths. You’d think would lot easier people, putting mask burden highest order. place opening restaurants bars outbreaks. Michigan simply got numbers low enough proper contact tracing, I'm assuming many mild asymptomatic cases compared say Arizona 12+ hour lines get tested.

Even clusters like Michigan ~ 200 - 300 cases per day. Arizona 4k+ probably massive backlog people unable get tested. Texas 6k+ per day. Florida 9k+ per day. Georgia 2k+ per day. etc.

By metrics Michigan one best states nearly half states significantly worse March/April. move makes absolutely sense. fuhrer told democratic hoax make look bad. I've good luck arguing point along asking want restaurants barbers shut again. even say want things open possible wear masks asking want go ten steps back like Texas. way get bars open wear masks.

Playing people's selfishness working me. Yeah pay like $75 per paycheck. un-reasonable. Lmao.

Edit: increase past 5 years I've current job due us switching group pricing. think existence mass scale animal agriculture three things:

* Brings animals closer together disease spreads better amongst them
* Brings humans closer animals likely encounter animal species jumping pandemic disease
* Dumps animal biowaste human food supply causing consistent worries e coli salmonella.

Swine flu came meat industry. COVID-19 did. Avian Flu risk--and would poultry farming? 

Fundamentally introducing tons animals denser denser human society creating pandemic risk Luckily everyone else, It’s store, science, decides what’s safe. Go get store want want. don’t open business it’s violation. health codes wear mask store places. Otherwise follow rules get delivery. safe isn’t “feeling.” Small droplets suspended air directed towards face whenever breathe.

These droplets trapped fabric mask concentrates them.

You transfer droplets hands touching front mask.

Inoculation dose plays big role determining whether infected SARS-CoV-2.

I hope explanation suffices learning disabilities. can't get sunburned glass. 

You absolutely get sunburned glass! Windows buildings either tempered annealed glass, near transparent UV-A blocks 60-70% UV-B. better nothing far preventing sunburn melanoma, far complete protection.

Tempered glass, used car *windshields* (not side glass) nearly opaque UV-A UV-B. NY - 1,617 dead per 1m residents

FL - 163 dead per 1m residents

But sure....same thing ... mask easy breathe in. It’s Norma hospital mask. I’m sure shape kind exercise hurt lol. 

I also changed fresh one done. get damp they’re useless. 

Honestly guys wearing masks controversial all... wonder America fucked. think extra unemployment runs July 31, things going get violent. review Jacobson vs Massachusetts. supreme court case 1905. less made legal state governments forcibly immunize people. Jacobson want Small Pox vaccine. local health department trying stop small pox study? follow month discerning date infection. That's study claim remain asymptomatic. could well case, know. Well mean relatively articulate sentences least grammatically correct. still crazy. Thank god!!!  “Anti-intellectualism constant thread winding way political cultural life, nurtured false notion democracy means 'my ignorance good knowledge.'”― Isaac Asimov Yeah, kidding. keeping eye Italy months now...because country's problems seem presage every Western country's problems. Monongalia County averaging 2 new cases per day. (I wish location looked good!) let’s check back couple weeks. Good luck WV. You’ve certainly good run far. Dead last US get first case originally. Conclusions: Provided good hygiene social distancing measures, increased COVID-19 spread training facilities. wanna put like that....
But really, inject little Clorox beforehand per giant brain White House PART open ""greatest economy history everything"" ""miraculously disappear "". all, much important ""exercise right gather""(Pence says so). Wait....didn't somebody say FEBRUARY lockdown long enough would happen? think even MEDICAL DEGREE specialized viral disease 50 YEARS! (or close it. Remember AIDS many killed? guy lot anymore). Aww fuck it. Go ahead exercise staunch believer..Jesus save you. (snicker snicker) open early American standards? That's traditional school year, brutally hot AZ time year. Take care okay. Ive gotten tested every two weeks since late March caught despite working 50 hour weeks enclosed office non-stop AC whole time (legitimately essential job) multiple people tested positive. wear surgical masks work public, n95-level masks shopping crowded areas, keep decent distance people (6ft always possible realistic), wash sanitize hands whenever touch something isnt mine. That’s you’ll fine.

Use time stock essentials best winter that’s real horror show begin. 50 cents 1 dollar drugs weren’t run off. failed trials Arizonians give shit virus themselves. Behave like rational human being, respect social distancing measures, wear fucking mask Rt less 1. may go sides, goes lot Alex Jones listener side. ""both sides"" issue. Since industry. customers fucking nerve get mad us cause enforce masks walking bathroom. Walking past customers also built clear barrier ppl sit bar top clear window structure prevents us spreading anything bartender customer. fucking assholes complain barrier ""ruins ambiance bar""

So going 28$ hour fucking 12$ hour.  Luckily still unemployment. Boss pays us min wage 30 hours each. state unemployment pay anymore boss covers get 600 federal. 

But august 1st comes by......We locally owned bar (only 2 ppl it) 8 us 3 years working 50 hours week (since boss man care overtime pay since always bar capacity making good money)   us cant live 12 hour especially getting 30 hour peek season 3 + years.  FEEL BAD boss literally shut notice needs make profit wont enough employees working him. 

Every bar downtown making minimum 20. Even shittiesr bars make 15 hour. N higher end cocktail bar hand pressed citrus, syrups..etc. kind like bar ""Death &amp; Co"" style. 

So labor energy, amount work 12 even tolerable. idk man. Us employees said make work n stay n help much. Since fucking love place, owner even pays health insurance. bar boss gives us full coverage health insurance. 

So budget n go broke till September man....these fucking asshole, corona filled bars completely ruined ones actually fucking following rules. 

And customers balls even mad care health...WE GIVE EM UNLIMITED FREE MASKS DAY EVERYDAY......so u dont even need bring one come bar.  fucking issue, fucking scum. 


Sorry vent end. customers swear. Idk fuck raised em education got. fucking god. does? Shortens hospital stays? vaccine? Updated. Thanks, Clippy  Illinois things hand. live here. look numbers regularly. even talking about....

[heres article say wrong Imagine think discussing HEALTHCARE.

What fucking joke system place Alright sources. Anyone free google Coronavirus sweden.


Or check right contrary, China locked 15 million took actions threatened tank economy scared shit me. supplies place family prepped region US went lock down.

So much distrust China COVID, thankful reaction shock factor. cannot understand, life me, leaders blind happen. Umm forgot Cigarettes Sugar showed people went gym certain precautions didnt get virus. even read study? 

This entire sub thinks going gym automatic death sentence. study shows isnt. Idk reverse logic think "" bunch virus-free healthy people didn’t spread virus"", even suppose mean. regular people, didnt isolate study. still dont get here's conclusion- 

 **Conclusions: Provided good hygiene social distancing measures, increased COVID-19 spread training facilities.** live state masks mandatory.

It's enforced all. Nothing changed. Illinois way better states. Maybe governor knows what’s right testing supposed covered emergency declaration? thought saw congresswoman grill someone cornered agreeing testing costs would covered.  I’m Canadian almost every business maximum occupancy mask policy, well arrows floors stores directing customers go certain way. common thing American businesses too? Procedure masks around 70% effective, cloth masks fairly close that. never find accurate statistic cloth masks much depends materials whether blown extra fabric layers. fabrics perform equally, superior others. people protesting racial inequality held fire real civil rights issues like constitutional right get hair cut buy lawn fertilizer. Also, know Hitler made people wear masks, right? Going pub choice. adult. decide go pub time, means accept associated risk. responsible whatever happens next.

Going school mandatory. Schools reopening means students must attend. Adults making decision students. situation, decision-makers responsible happens children. Nobody stupid enough take risk. sounds like good mayor me, regardless party hes in.

And dont even know since im american. Trump good thing? Holy shit! What's angle here, intended consequence order, wrote sign? 😆 Yeah, that's reason. see comments FB page. People livid. entitled assholes. wish would mandate it. He's encouraging people follow guidelines weeks not. I'm Georgia lack masks crazy They’re “essentially restaurants.” different classifications bars restaurants. different liquor licenses. 

I don’t disagree restaurants also problem, bars restaurants type place. NH Residents
We able provide testing residents, without symptoms, provided cost health insurance State NH cover cost testing COVID-19."" Coming country near WHAT. they'll also get weird fill out. understand. Aren’t better treating flu even 10 years ago? mean flu treatments. indeed become pandemic would late put years vaccine? Also wouldn’t harder time spreading flu pandemic 09’ since don’t remember people socially distancing, wearing masks limited international travel.

I’m also sure mortality long term health impacts comes flu. different it’s bird flu swine? Georgia 2 new cases today: rediscovered love Horizon Zero Dawn! perfect mix Parkour robot dinosaurs. love cooking certain dishes make home. things quite time consuming. things require ingredient use much goes waste. think many people make carne asada, sushi, chicken Tikka masala, fried chicken, pad krapow, etc good decent restaurant. I've tried making carnitas times good, good taqueria. there's clean up. 

I typically eat home cooked 5 days week, order take once, one random day anything usually make ""trash"" food childhood like Frito boats. love false dichotomy folks try put us:

* Workers going starve without paychecks
* Workers going exposed Covid-19

As soon point could government support start acting like government super fiscally responsible till point poor people bridge far. It’s weird American, it’s Russian bots dividing country social media. SFB president loves it.

I remember Japanese cars showed here, uncle war. triggered. 

We fought proxy wars Russia. mean, think Vietnam really jet fighters pilots?

Now, winning without shot fired. masks, bad tests, buddy WH anything protect citizens idiot gets free speech.. lol Misleading.Sweden averaging 25-30 daily. 225 last week. Meanwhile Nordic neighbors recording 0-1 deaths per day. Sure hope expand CARES act. think so, seen anything large scale campaigns least someone living here. doubt studies though. first started antibody testing mix normal blood donors study made make sure get mixed future. I've said before, I'll say again. Lots people lung damage + flu season = potential disaster. worrisome.  Old people stay fuck home. don’t need sitting bars day they’re retired. Stay fuck home you’re retired.  Sitting: One kid Economy kid Populace. 

Raking pile: Coronavirus 

On swing:  Government Response Nice confirmation, contemporary observations led similar conclusions. way ""new"" information, also excuse lack preparedness part United States. It’s mixed signals leaders, never should’ve even right left issue begin with. It’s sickness vs wellness, leadership collectively failed put message appropriately American people. 

I’ve long hunched recently come believe Cognitive Dissonance very, real thing. say, reality’s subjective person. head BS, fake hoax, big deal whatever matter *what* happens comes you’re gonna dismiss find narratives ( *cough cough Fox News* ) fit beliefs. true end spectrum well, know serious thing following like hawk stories come highlighting underscoring threats speak most. 

People don’t give shit facts anymore, give shit feels. actually unity strong leadership advising us threat necessary precautions get go would’ve worked long better. “fake news” crowd needs take step back look what’s actually happening states hit hardest right now. people still complain it. allowing protests BLM protest would valid point. happens see point. Yes. Figure two drinks (wine cocktail) person easily $55-$60 right there. Everyone’s buttholes fall One question happen catch COVID wearing mask, likely get much lower viral load thus making infection less severe? time market king Japanification impending climate disaster unstoppable roaming bands Mongols slowly closing kingdom. Saying mom probably die hyperbolic. segment society demographically 50% die. Even 100 year olds 80 percent survival odds.
I think keep social distancing wear masks. Provide benefits risk stay home.
Can agree things world important coronavirus? mean, racism one. seems we've decided protests worth it. school? know unrelated, going back next day tradition? always meant forget something go back? lol point, I'm thinking hospitals refuse treat anyone bellow age 60 let natural selection thing.
If dumb enough neglect health like that, consequences fault. well far right idiocy, racism homophobia exists world. prevalent many european countries. scary sight say country based failure? No. I’m saying decline happening since start country people appointed. corruption stems way back Trump. That’s speak low progress made. I’m talking discussing positive made article negative things did. keep bringing good things I’m shining light downfalls? know America good things bring bad too. fact totally countries didn’t like us see us glorious example success far back conception. Britain looked us barbaric slavery era freed slaves did. It’s also interesting focus founding fathers literally name brought up. angry them? corrupt. Even standards. That’s hide lot demons closets even presidents like Jefferson went graves knowing full well actions inexcusable. Ugh bill gates throw us next /s @kylegriffin1

PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona governor orders bars, nightclubs, gyms, movie theaters water parks close least 30 days virus. I've living it. think indoor activities involve masks going result backsliding another lockdown. difference parts U.K. they’ve got infection date first. Northern Ireland reported less 20 cases past 7 days, Scotland deaths cases days etc Take Los Angeles, announced enforce it, reality police enforcing unclear  findings apply  areas  much higher COVID-19 incidence rates,  rate  new positive tests outside  trial  Oslo trial period substantially different many States counties United States currently report (e.g. positive test rate per 100,000 individuals  week  June 15 21, 2020 13 Maine, 25 New Jersey, 22.5 Massachusetts) (8).

What current infection rate West curious. common? worry elementary high schools opening fall. I'm willing homeschool kids to. husband's classes online grad school completely online.  Yeah, Canadian province Ontario, survival rate confirmed cases age 40 currently 99.9989% divide deaths cases age bracket. that's including asymptomatic mild cases tested.

I'm 26.

I need chill out. mean taking less precautions, truly need RELAX. Wait what? Already new version? played first game yet. Governor going kill state. say were! Nah keep em open. flu! partially Americans fault like expect people living paycheck paycheck gov nothing help people struggling right now.

$1200? Congratulations, paid landlord little month's rent. tell family 3 year old Guatemala died. Thanks I'll stick opinion this. fact handling crisis tanking poll numbers evidence public ignore it. American, saw article said going push back moving next stage reopening, thought good him. sees problem, he's trying solve it. jeez read handled this, think problem. love release sequel I've even left theater original good question, one governor likely can't answer, since wearing mask today's presser kick man country already? He's menace society! Hey, say most! 

Sorry making apparently unfounded statement. go likely handful? know one, least work year-long district, common Phoenix area. start late July. gathering leads cases thus deaths assuming everyone stay away humans alone months years? never said live it. I'm afraid we'll see another lockdown opening restaurants bars indoor.  Good. Bars dining-in restaurants really increased spike CA. We’re reclosing bars many areas it’s enough. 

Most people don’t pay close attention specifics. assume thing open it’s safe, far truth. meat, freeze everything. three freezers, realize option everyone  Uhh you’re observant. Smh 🤦‍♂️ virus spread aerosols now? thought droplets. RemindMe! 30 days make masks mandatory across country? People need read press release. 94% immune response human trails protection replication separate study mice part research effort. still good news Old glory needs help get. MUH FREEDUMBS!!!  press charges want pursue it,"" Alvarado said.

Dooo it. feel like every story read like ends result. dipshits gonna learn consequences. sick, head.... sorry made mistake state site L.A. times tracker shows yesterday's total +8,247 I'd worried Florida; heat humidity, frequent storms, hurricanes, tornadoes. Imagine tornado warning coming tent filled sedated people ventilators - like wtf would even do?! children aged 5 14 actively older people time period? much winning remember need feel ashamed anything using mask people can't see fucking face! People always say this. well many others U.S. comply fully extent countries enforced months end. saw results. feels effortless 50% citizens giving shit. blame them. months got tired too. I'll try buy it. us trying responsible trying minimize amount time spent shopping already adopting physical distancing measures. opportunities pointedly shun someone wearing mask without outright confronting seem rather rare, there's fair chance get hint, care.

Review bombing retail establishments runs issue asking low wage front line workers already assuming higher average risk infection assume risk assaulted killed nutjobs.

I realize saying _critical mass_ people adopted measures it'd become norm everyone else would quickly acquiesce to. I'm skeptical that, even right, there's way flip switch get everyone get cultural rational inhibitions behaving way fast enough substantially combat pandemic.

Mandating mask wearing law and, necessary, police enforce law issuing citations extremely effective, far feasible put action wishing for. Could also due lot less deaths due Quarantine? address death rate state says percentage deaths could due less causes.  would perhaps helpful reduce suffering immediately, even there's better thing around -- least could help perhaps, like something good far away close - guess use since close. Like make treatment - yet sitting around shelf, people suffering - could help people. Right now. Rather sitting collecting dust, people withering away.

I think something like could made could much efficient, actually need produced? Money? -- actual resources. actual ingredients needed make it. Money afterthought, get point -- resources.

Also actually make it, like fully automatic mass production, pour raw ingredients, assembly line assembles resources together, keep producing constantly -- there's perhaps manually everything, manually pick test tube, manually walking area pour something, wait while, go back manually test equipment, collect stuff, pour small glass bottle, cap it, put label it; takes long time. Maybe mix manually things too, assembly line -- yet taking perhaps hours manually testing sample, kind thing, taking long time - manually things, gotta make production sound know exactly produce something good go get go.

Which also think instead like using hard make stuff like glass vials like maybe treatment like example -- use something else much easier mass produce, eg; HDPE plastic. Glass hand gotta purify sand melt form small vial perhaps using bunch machines so, uh uh that's taking long. HDPE, perhaps much easier produce, perhaps much easy produce lot due requires make, form ethylene -- turn HDPE get immediately forming plastic, perhaps much easier glass. HDPE perhaps much easier mass produce glass, much easier work perhaps well. HDPE bottles, seems pretty legit me, way plastic pretty safe use, much cleaner - think pretty similar glass terms reactivity so, much issue perhaps treatments like this.

Gonna give take long time everything, using inefficient ways make things, think perhaps getting point mass produce much easier make materials.

And also think care other, looking well able freely make something people stay alive reduce suffering. Dude, watch American respond COVID?

What basing statement on? Good thing rest insurance. mean within america? Plenty countries game plan trace isolate new cases getting case number aa much possible. Keep vaccine.

Seems like New Zealand gameplan? sure saying That's pretty shit vaccine. problem electing politicians. worst people job governing.  governments failure protect educate mentally disabled cannot themselves. dumb fuck believe wearing mask helps point time buddy works social media tracking company. exactly says. Crawls public social media provides analysis government departments private enterprises. need organizations also dubious.


He employed working home. worried social unrest human lives “One death tragedy million deaths statistic.” taste like shit can’t say I’ve figured way eat mask on. Whatever be. Escape God? He's one gave mask. never use much salt butter restaurants do, cheffy flourishes make good restaurant great. dying really great food. *literally* dying, go yet. need reassurance right actually. Well see... way get two vaccines ... vaccine &amp; stimulus ~~one~~ shit two. I'll keep eating meat thanks. one wants walk around vegan skinny noodle arms. think definition “under control” different us commoners.

Save America! Wear mask, wash hands, socially distance!

I apologize sounds harsh, tell care trying right thing. is, significantly slow spread better option comes along.

For example, works younger patients, could still vaccinate significant portion workforce use combo social distancing elderly potentially eradicate virus. Magically? realize indoor transmission likely happen outdoor transmission, right?

~60% people infected influenza present symptoms IIRC.  Every restaurant needs closed inside dining. There's zero reason people sit inside breathing everyone's air. anyone translate necessary test results? Suppose testing two groups 1000 people (one group placebo, one vaccine)? 30 people placebo group get infected, 15 people vaccine group get infected, would call 50% effective? 50% _more_ effective.

If math, I'm impressed ""50% effective placebo"". language like ""better nothing..."" DeWine Murphy (and DeSantis Newsom failure end spectrum) showing COVID19 give fuck political party belong thing matters science. Yes. get 15 hour.

You staying home helps prevent community transmission prevents patients getting sick, including drs, nurses, medical non medical staff.

That’s choice have. choice skip dr appointment risk 15 year old heart transplant life, putting whole family risk financial ruin. Weren’t several marches though? first march town? need talk I'm you. Everything risky things risky others pretend otherwise deny scientific reality. inexplicably breezed Arizona too. Even protests lead spread NYC, lead spike cases. health authorities states saying outright protests major source spread. Reports significant outbreaks coming protests far between; even article, highly questionable young woman even got protests, since started experiencing symptoms shorter time virus's known minimum incubation period.

I think saying ""Bars source spread, protests"" may technically true, misleading bars much significant source spread. get wrong, I'm glad protests winding down, hope mass gatherings stop long time. based I've researched indoor vs. outdoor transmission, bars way bigger threat, every state probably order closed.

Edit: clear, annoys NYC contact tracers ask people attended protests. definitely have. keep hearing Goldman Sachs. especially since 2008 Recession. Still idea they're rich sat back snickering NYC hit hard. I'm glad hit rural Midwest. facts science said coming way.

Still waiting, Donny! It’s ok, every country doesn’t need it. We’re wearing masks. love people bring graph, look forecast begins ends, *it still shows net decline deaths*. he'll need pick pace wants keep fat boss sources support earlier post all. looks like first source even evaluating covid19 virus. Problem portion people don’t believe anything news states regards science. least that’s case America. always see Facebook Instagram people condemning others giving facts “Stop believing everything hear CNN, Fox, MSNBC.” Americans don’t care other. American, it’s really sad watch divisive everything gotten here. either one side things don’t brain you’re idiot much China going sell for? That’s real question Brevard County Commission Decides Intentionally Spread Virus Among Vulnerable Populations. people paying attention, numbers mean anything bc men (let's honest, men) died battle, young fit. people dying covid generally elderly. course cases young people dying too, overwhelmingly, numbers older people. can't compare life life. People would taking seriously predominantly 20 - 40 year olds dying. never said protests acceptable, fuck about?

Can make honest point without stuffing unrelated shit it? think really MAGA Americans would trust ""Wuhan"" Vaccine? use test kit Germany using offered us. Instead CDC made contaminated. 

I care develops working vaccine. Here's arm, please vaccinate comrade. Chinese get first, could get politicized utilized here. Many state governors requiring masks eve worn mean could argue protecting others protecting though, wearing mask makes everyone else wear mask, stops massive spreading effect protecting yourself, directly. guess I'm trying say protecting others wearing mask eventually encourage others wear thier mask essentially end protecting yourself. Like room 10 people 8 others wear mask protect last person, eventually social pressure get wear mask ideal work, would end protecting indirectly. Health authorities aren’t advocating longitudinal harsh lockdowns tho. Maybe harsh short term one reduce infections traceable number primarily health authorities advocating resume daily life precautions numbers dwindle. Plus raise valid point, life always going come risk. completely risk-less world possible. 

At point value longevity life quality life? What’s point alive sit around exist without interaction? literally hundred different vaccine companies, trying hardest create vaccin. high hopes, I'm layman posting stuff reddit.

Question two little complex answer actually:
It usually takes _9 years_ develop new vaccin. 9 years, faster? There's things they're speed lot, goal apx 18 months. still safe effective regular process, achieve that?

The answer : money. Usually, happens first test small number volunteers (phase 1). Then, deemed safe effective, scale bit see still looks safe (phase 2). phases done strict control, close monitoring volunteers. Next phase (3) scale even further, see actually works. phases successful, get approval start sell public.

But governments organizations everything speed up. Nevermind costs more, let's scale already phase 1. combine phase 2 3. still safe effective, costs lot more.
Another thing they're starting mass producing vaccine gone phases. Either successful, vaccines ready shipped, fails, case cost lot money.

But, Oxford university might ask, said vaccine september? true? Well, stated vaccine _for emergency use_. means vaccine that's approved, available public, high risk personnel might able take it.

Inovio, company linked article, probably used Department Defence emergency vaccine months. mean access it. wait early 2021 best case scenario. So, two interesting takeaways.

The first GDP hurt uncontrolled spread. seems like obvious point remember reopened save economy. asked sacrifice corporations could give million dollar bonuses.

This means market actually drives policy safety.

The second thing know hold country hostage demand safety. lift 1 rock, find cockroach. lift 2 rocks, find 2 cockroaches. cockroach problem getting worse lifted rocks? Italy one foundations western civilization xenophobic asshat Go China! Steal IP show Yankees who's boss! one waiting vaccines, least Europe. false dichotomy die already? Everyone else Europe opted variation supression leading Test, Trace, Isolate

Bit like Sweden, then.

I mean come on, current fatality rate 39 per 100,000 total population, there’s way could possibly think hospitalization 4.6 per 100,000 infected?

Could you? discussing weeks ago predicted response. think solely due reopening naive, get it, want absolve shift blame.

There many factors play, global mass gatherings surrounding protests significant factor. Important note 6093 cases 41k tests 18% positive rate.

Hello Texas. weeks ago. Covid two areas already ravaged Covid deaths per million 5 10x higher places currently experiencing surges.

Ok settles that. Bye. Text full:

Gilead Sciences, maker first covid-19 treatment found worked clinical trials, remdesivir, said Monday charge U.S. hospitals $3,120 typical patient private insurance.

Soon announcement, Trump administration said secured nearly company’s supply drug use U.S. hospitals September, contract 500,000 treatment courses, make available hospitals Gilead’s price.

Other developed countries pay 25 percent less United States, discount Gilead said reflects need make drug widely available possible throughout world.

The company licensed generic manufacturers produce drug developing countries, receive treatment “at substantially lower cost,” company said. 

Gilead’s announcement settles lingering question drug shown modest benefit remains [only therapy authorized Food Drug treat hospitalized patients covid-19, disease caused novel coronavirus. clinical trial sponsored government showed drug — invented Gilead [developed largely taxpayer-funded — sped hospital recoveries four days. statistically significant impact survival covid-19 patients.

Setting price novel drug middle pandemic posed unprecedented challenge, Gilead said. Cutting four days hospital costs patient saves U.S. health system $12,000 per patient, company said. Based benchmark, suggested could justified higher price.

“As many aspects pandemic, uncharted territory pricing remdesivir,” Gilead’s chairman chief executive, Daniel O’Day, wrote open letter Monday morning. “As world continues reel human, social economic impact pandemic, believe pricing remdesivir well value right responsible thing do.”

Gilead said spent $1 billion develop manufacturer remdesivir end 2020. Gilead invented drug 10 years ago searching treatments hepatitis C develop it. Later, drug’s potential antiviral emerging diseases explored partnership government. Taxpayers spent least $70 million developing drug, according advocates. 

An [independent analysis last Institute Clinical Economic Review said Gilead could recover costs distributing drug little $1 $60 per dose, $100 $160 per dose company’s 2020 costs taken account. 

Under Monday’s pricing, Gilead set price $520 per dose United States $390 per dose developed countries. Gilead said six doses required, U.S. Department Health Human Services said using average 6.25 vials estimated costs hospitals.

Members Congress consumer advocates raised concerns Monday Gilead could seeking profit unfairly taxpayer-backed invention amid pandemic.

“We midst full-blown global health crisis,” said Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), chairs House Energy Commerce oversight investigations panel. “We need make sure treatment potential save lives available need it, afford it.”

Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) said Gilead set “an outrageous price modest drug, taxpayer funding saved scrapheap failures.” criticized Trump administration demanding lower price contract first 500,000 courses treatment.

“In grotesque display hubris disregard public, Gilead priced several thousand dollars drug public domain,” said Peter Maybarduk, access medicines director nonprofit group Public Citizen. “Gilead make remdesivir alone. Public funding indispensable stage, government scientists led early drug discovery team. Allowing Gilead set terms pandemic represents colossal failure leadership Trump administration.”

Through September, HHS distribute drug state health departments based number hospitalized patients covid-19, agency said. State health departments allocate drug hospitals based need — process HHS employed donation 120,000 treatment courses drug, whose final allocation shipped Monday.

“To extent possible, want ensure American patient needs remdesivir get it,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said statement. “The Trump Administration everything power learn lifesaving therapeutics covid-19 secure access options American people.”

Demand remdesivir soared [National Institutes Health announced April 29 clinical trial shown hospitalized patients advanced covid-19 received experimental drug recovered faster similar patients received placebo. Two days later, [the Food Drug Administration, citing results, approved treat severely ill patients.

Confirmed coronavirus cases soared recent weeks, health officials warned Sunday window closing stop spread virus. number [confirmed cases surpassed 2.5 million crushing new wave infections continued bear throughout country’s South West. Across nation, 40,587 new daily cases reported.

Florida, Texas Arizona emerging country’s latest epicenters reporting record numbers new infections weeks row. Positivity rates hospitalizations also spiked. Sunday, Arizona Georgia hit new one-day case highs.

HHS likely send first shipment 500,000 treatment courses two weeks, senior HHS official said call reporters. agency looks hospitalization every day, official said, “complete dive” every two weeks. current plan carefully look distribution hospitalized patients across country one week begin directing first shipment go.

Remdesivir must administered intravenously, limited use hospitalized patients significant covid-19 progression. company testing inhaled form, would allow patients use home, earlier disease, might greater benefit. 

Meanwhile, inexpensive steroid shown greater benefit death rate patients hospitals. 60-year-old drug, dexamethasone, reduced risk death patients ventilators third cut risk death patients oxygen fifth, according [study published June 16. America involved though. wkrnt. yes, I'm reluctant spend long indoors ac going. idk effective filters cleaned. businesses cut corners like hot water, could also filters. knows. fuck still PPE issues? Previous generations even larger age gap. boomers almost 20 years duration (1946-1964). 

Also, I’m 30, &lt;1 year older you, definitely millennials friend. We’re like damn core millennials, since relate older ones born 80s younger ones later 90s. Like, narrow birth range definition “millennial” 5-10 year span would definitely it. may misled media/uneducated people calling kids actually Gen Z “millennials”. kids never millennials. 

Either way, definitely remember high school calling us millennials. think 2006 first time heard term used instead Gen Y, previous name, people age. NZ done great job, mean need stay lockdown vaccine? definitely dumb. personally think merely deliberately acts stupid everyone underestimates him. Whot?!? blame CIA?!? don’t serve world. serve USA only. blame game getting control. Seriously, need work together fight horrible virus. know there's room DeSantis, Abbott, Kemp, others crowded around. They're certainly social distancing get close! forgive seeing apparent obvious greatness. think deaths bottomed out. lets see Arizona reports tomorrow.

if report less 100 fatalities i'll breathe. scientific experts say long coronavirus relatively low levels community, sanitize classrooms much possible keep adults mingling. Masks middle school above.

I believe data-based decisions listening scientists. middle class dead, upper class lie wealthy tell proles they're slummin it. There's club, either ain't. ain't better trashing it. shoulda called Saul lol.....well sure, doubt get Canada moment legally, border opens................your choice, know? goofy people too, common sense actually far common. say quite honestly way Canadians handled (in general) something proud of. still over, potentially could still mess up, far people responsible, reasonable, logical. good leadership. non-partisan, calm, encouraging exactly been. country !! It’s “happening”, identified *scientists trying prevent next pandemic*. add this, run commercial units bringing outside air expelling return air, get good cooling long outside air hotter 80-85 degrees. Texas, already hotter that, bring 90-100 degree air try cool it, building upwards 80 degrees. people bitching masks heat. wtf...... absurdly incorrect. That’s basic virology works. We’re downvoting we’re doomers, we’re downvoting cause that’s point. 

Deaths seem slowing down, there’s already evidence coronavirus dangerous consequences road form lung damage, blood clots (which cause strokes), etc. 

It’s enough say deaths going down, need rate cases go well creating false choice? options 1. gatherings 100s drunken unmasked people indoors 2. one seeing one else ever...?

The truth is, eliminate situations one infected individual infect dozens others, situations really necessary live fulfilling life, whilst time leaving room open close gatherings family, people meeting others going dates forming intimate relationships, meeting buddies outdoor BBQ. Yes, things carry risk someone may sick pass on, least happens they're passing close people, people name, tracked down, also tested, isolated they're positive. bar club allows none that.

We still fulfilling lives, can't literally anything want now.

Take account, blind see boss using keep labor costs down. I'm fine tipped wage higher stabdard pay nature industry, BOH almost always gets fucked somehow way.

And that's point making. cousin died h1n1 horrible, 30. spite arizonas data dash board, 'Hospital Bed Usage &amp; Availability' button, opening additional bed measures many hospitals Arizona.... ??website fully updated?? would really nice tested positive (via ELISA test) antibodies two months ago. caring child active case (no symptoms confirmed via test). guess see firsthand get twice. 👏That 👏won't 👏work 👏 Troll 100% don’t care Yes also 2 friends medical field told numbers increasing hospital. think decision open it’s lost alot money keep everything closed forever, long people following rules wearing masks + don’t touching face washing/sanitizing hands fine.. sad things quebecers believe Youtube videos fake Covid stupid stuff taking seriously. course arent seeing rises dont stupid president probably handled virus properly. hits late places like restaurants. 

Im new york indoor seating 3 weeks noticeable increase cases coming states. dont travel ban, matter time.  

Also 21 days isnt enough days determine anything.  first time around infection rate tripled week. social distancing.  active case 21 days later would 27 cases... However 21 days would 729 cases 21 days 19,683 cases.


Again idea virus works... 21 days isnt shit talk 6 weeks.... Pandemics always 2nd 3rd waves people like you.  Back phase 3 number cases skyrocketed governor's making masks mandatory despite GOP leadership says. Anyone wants pretend still leader still relevant needs encourage mask use. main policies would ?

People get covid Trump rallies, virus magically leaves protesters/rioters alone.  impression research demonstrated removing masks extended period enclosed space puts everyone space risk due aerosolized viral particles expelled breathing circulating entire space. length time spent without mask, type breath activity (breathing &lt; talking &lt; singing shouting), size room, amount air circulation replacement, distance people effect. mind, tiny period time spent walking table would fairly insignificant terms risk, even given greater proximity people, compared hour spent without mask enclosed space. One sick person filling space circulated breath could well infect everyone else space hour. want enclosed space length time non-mask-wearers unless quite sure none infected, air removed quickly replaced fresh air ventilation system. certainly trust restaurants states right now.

Specifically taxes including this? Income tax? Sales tax? Capital gains tax? anyone good source show work much wear mask indoors office?

I get idea wearing masks whenever walking around important people charge seem believe important directly communicating others.

 everyone required mask actually wear go start talking someone else. want something solid makes clear show them.

Oh fuck marxists wasn’t political all. Get fucked. want concern you. sayin: Ww add summary bot submission. Canada 103,000 cases TOTAL. Yes smaller population reason numbers except inept government response citizens refuse accept facts. cannot comprehend numbers like these. heart goes American people taking seriously knowing government care live die. thing happened Oregon. low cases people stopped wearing masks much, cases spiked. remdesivir still relevant? gilead moderna suck. point seems protests caused spike. emotional, evidence free opinion. large evidence far reopenings failure businesses (like bars, etc.) patrons take social distancing guidelines seriously undoing.

If evidence suggesting otherwise besides emotions politics, please share.  many stories Americans dying afford medication? still profitable elsewhere grants cover it. EVERY DEVELOPED NATION except US socialized healthcare ones US system benefits avarice greed gluttony pharmacological insurance companies.

What about, about, about.

I referring issues, know exist Americans. rest world also profits US researched medicine becoming generic countries without R&amp;D costs usually paid American sick people.

The US system obviously great American people, mean system existing allowing socialized systems successful would without American R&amp;D.

Nice new account 80 karma alternately posting hateful trash begging upvotes Sharknado 5 - Coronado Per Dr Sanjay Gupta ""I know get mess""  Yes it'll get noticed earlier ppl take seriously, careful gets cure research fast, thus containing starving it. Unlike highly contagious virus seems make ppl believe hoax *ahemcovid* you’re racist even asking that. /s almost definitely fine. Transmission surfaces unlikely. garage great air flow. And, unlikely delivery person carrier.

If anxious it, wait hours. But, I'd lean towards counseling try comfortable idea risk already practically zero. helpful behave everyone potential carrier- understand enough transmitted apply common sense situation. Treating everything touched stranger hot lava negative impact anxiety long term. question ""will wearing mask protect me"" ... mostly answer no. really understand disease then, especially long pre-symptomatic incubation period. generally thought ""if get sick I'll stay home"" would enough.

Now recognize perfectly healthy seeming people spread virus several days showing symptoms all.

Understand this: *Right moment least couple hundred thousand infected Americans walking around idea they're contagious*. know they're sick days.  people wore masks, would help one bit, would vastly reduce number people infect.

Each every one us may group infected people. Odds low, sure, *no way knowing* getting tested. *Because there's chance might infected*, need wear mask close people. simple.

Denial powerful -- people fearful might sick know yet, they'd rather pretend impossible. can't **me** who's sick, must someone else. It’d probably extremely cheap. know people put cars think cost around 400 usd. problem would “MAH FREEDUMZ BEIN OPPRESSED!” (Who also people don’t wear masks) fact sooooooooo many people US drive “buzzed” time. it’ll never happen. assume meant 2017.

The attacks would get worse. I'm surprised turn moment said ""15 cases almost 0"" whatever comment hit national disaster. moment nobody side would ever able see problem. Big guy says problem? PROBLEM!

And see acted day day various social media outlets. Everyone wearing masks everywhere, common people, long want drag for. even super cute, I've fun treating like fashion accessories, bf wants kill I'm buying new one like every week. Here's recent purchase Fauci getting grouchy add: shortage staff equipment also major problem. current number healthcare workers enough influx patients seeing right now.

In Arizona example, ICU-patients nurse ratio Doctors need re-use share PPE, hospitals may enough respiratory ventilators. list goes on... keep closed? simple. politician. No, it’s result segregated society. think trend countries high spread. point it’s necessarily unpopular Swedish strategy stands out, common denominators among countries high spread. Oh neat, we'll get sooner mind hundreds thousands people choking fluid lungs outside hospital get admitted. Super reassuring. That’s sub spirit! Good Neighbors around us set illegal fireworks every year. expect lot year. arrogance comes ignorance.

Maybe put together support group, lol. alone politicians loop March impending doom? masked"" bullshit, not. seen large groups completely unmasked March.

I'm impressed. trust science backs narrative huh mom too. called ""covid denier"". believe numbers. want know people protest Arizona exempt due governors party starting D. First take water parks, take guns!!! /s Booze though? That’s something folks willing risk parents grand parents lives over! improving public health preventing communicable diseases whole thing he's smarter you. Why? Nashville TN mandated masks times ton exceptions, like dining out....so would restaurants get scared now, get essential excuse enforce masks anyways.  Don’t worry. We’re going get thru herd immunity. Telling black guy ""he hang tree"" racist af, matter says it. pretty unlikely black person would tell another black person ""hang tree"".  mention doctors contact tracing DRC Ebola hit especially hard. Like people middle conflict zones excuses all. NYC complaint form 311, nothing, mostly enforced collective death stares. way New Jersey open responsibly open non-residents. believe countries done studies many aspects. U.S... much. 

In fact, might notice good percentage new articles still use three four examples corona outbreaks - South Korean call center; choir practice; restaurant Wuhan; dude attended party, birthday party friends sharing food apartment, went ANOTHER gathering infected people.

All happened March earlier.

The U.S. heavy shrieking, doomsday talking heads questioning whether every single study airtight, light useful facts concerning MILLONS CASES. Scientists doctors busy taking checks appear nightly cable news programs next video of... people going beach. little, late. appropriate response would issue lockdown. quick easy way wipe chinese military one easy step. CIA must planted really high ranking general PLA. I’m sending mine. 

I trust direction state. close, I’ll make remote learning work Usually hate black people Postpone when? election? point, then. Might well hold reopening schools months well. correct, it’s keep citizens alive. citizens, businesses, proven aren’t mature enough make reasonable choices. choices affected them, say it. playing Russian Roulette innocent bystanders’ lives. use war analogy people fighting enemy. Probably one billionaires helping fund vaccines trying combat malaria important disease research entire foundation dedicated stuff? isn’t like ja rule joke Dave chapelle, foundation actually trying level good humanity. lying: care, least locked down.

If telling truth: Congrats them, sure hell seem taking seriously U.S. Absolute madness. watch old tv shows people shaking hands I’m like wait what? What's difference? subreddit obsessed masks agree they’re great wearing them. don’t stop spread, reduce it. great logic OP used enough. saying gatherings cause deaths, whether you’re wearing masks that’s still case America full alcoholics hate life. funny alcohol essential guess. Even though 100% recreational. I’ve bars Chicago say everyone ever see wearing masks minding business. bro-y frat neighborhood Wrigley Field. ones wearing masks certainly minority Chicago. doubt comment meant downplay cops thing, realistically fact people dying based color skin pretty fucking awful. never good idea compare struggles. 

I think easier outraged something really basic like cop interactions non-minorities live life without fear. many americans know world cheap health care harder imagine life without it. need restaurant reform. really criminal provide living wage restaurant. profits come front back house providing service guests pay for, things working out, quality takes hit. Sure, I'll make food $2,000 hours, paid minimum wage really takes soul it. anyone right protest whatever want matter stupid may seem? Well yes, obviously quite lot cases Sweden. america good thing i've got ocean front property arizona.... Totally wasnt protests zombies coming gonna that, put plastic bag entire head? failure scenario? success. 

How exactly March, April, May squandered? suppose know tear gas may involved might wear freaking mask Wtf think gunna happen peeps start drinking g hhahaha death rate decreased

give another week start rising too. Good parents protect kids getting sick dying, prioritize playdates People go 3 hour meals ? Bill. Same. Fuck idiots. they'd reopened care intelligence take step back, we'd able see Tenet soon. Bill Gates live America.

He lives country works him. Make money. course thought things would better idea things are. us. Kind of... mild... hardly anyone started wearing masks municipalities mandated it... Ask Rick Grimes something could cover faces would keep virus spreading easily. proud asocial Midwesterner praying case. watched neighbors street combination graduation party son bridal shower daughter cars lining street. cannot roll eyes fall head. Let's see happen protests. First/Second/Third week May depending grade level district. Everything everyone stupid fuck. That’s why. Floridians actually read: fuck wrong state?   looking good VA well. opened slowly, one first states close schools year, also one first states mandatory masks public. Also helps Governor also doctor 300K

That’s meaningless number. isn’t cure, it’s almost 1k new cases day

Brazil **25,000 new cases day** proportionally 10% testing (meaning that’s likely gross undercount). sure, criticize going best place test world altering vaccine. complete lack critical thinking skills inability grasp basic math, you’re well positioned critique Oxford fucking University. thought Trump's 2nd term moment USA become liability free world. seems ahead schedule. It’s going ugly reopen protests clash BLM protests everyone gets tear gassed. video disagree everything said. first US case 21 January.

:D Came say Let clear - I'm defending actions governments around world regarding pandemic - many botched it. But, I'm also ignoring fact CCP, willfully, aggravated pandemic corrupting delaying data provided. Frankly, actual 'real' data got Italy Germany. absolutely advocating rolling back 1st amendment. advocate governmental consequences speech already exist advocating rolling back 1st amendment. So, want cede power government need 100% sure trust government. Speech far powerful right tool simply cede government random people throwing insults around. deaths forgotten. Expect war. don’t want people losing momentum flu. BLM. Look, I'm sure mean well, simply believe claim hospitals empty facing bankruptcy. believe news outlets reporting actual data what's going country. Best luck you. people already infected useless test vaccine... quit FB back. big reason avoiding getting rid many pictures HS College had. way get zip file pictures. i'll sleep 2025. Maybe even 2030, economic crisis gets really ba

Can spoon you? Why? I'd like see science behind long comes reputable source. Orange County, California No. person claiming going repeatedly infect everyone die. hold breath Moderna vaccine. Nucleic acid vaccines (Moderna's mRNA) really proven track record humans. RNAs therapeutics general tough time going animal preclinical testing human use. One day someone figure get mRNA vaccine work, subunit + adjuvant adenoviral vaccines (ChAdOx) likely win particular race.

You correct much easier bang mRNA vaccines scale. can't' imagine disrespected medical professionals must feel. People making already stressful jobs much harder, what..... go eat? hospitals full watching people suffer.....all asking keep people safe governments like ""um... sounds fake lol""  Implies high detected case count actually result genuinely recent surge new cases, high cases confirmed cases shot new tests.

So everyone weeks ago saying real number due testing enough actually astronomical probably wrong  human life means nothing them. care almighty dollar. 💵 ⚰ assuming everyone protests got tested though, realistic that? ""Winter coming."" - better Stark warning know one seems making peer-reviewed studies effectiveness face shields. plenty YouTube videos showing effectiveness stopping droplet travel, none peer-reviewed. might compliance encouraged relative comfort. Deaths declining.. starting pickup states decided coronavirus weeks ago. states responsible going fucked fellow states acting like fools. March: *It's real threat.*

April: *It's real thing big deal.*

May: *I allowed make choices stores open big threat, stores government.*

June: *Masks dumb wear one!*

July: *Masks clearly proven work, p resident said so.*

August: *The p resident clearly done great job handling telling everyone wear masks! people still attacking him??*

September: *I miss grandma...* someone ELI5 jokes them, ptsd working covid already caused issues Arizona rationing health care now. Texas soon. I'm sure desensitized. think see New York City real full human lives. know anyone infected died (and almost everyone know NYC knows someone it, many us know passed). real people (selfish people) gets front door. unfortunate. gotta take back stimulus check somehow ""The one person tried warn us.""

Except literally entire scientific community globally, everyone working healthcare. 

🤦‍♂️ Oh yes, Reddit loves casual racism  honestly shocked lack awareness sub. There's people think death rate 3%. possible, time people think death rate still high. MOUNTAIN evidence much lower that. somewhere 0.2-1% extremes range unlikely. Based CDC data, best range seems somewhere 0.26% 0.44%.

Regardless, lot least understand fact, I'm even confused shocked statement Fauci. Let's take worst possible case: 1% mortality. peak US, 2300 deaths/day means one point 230,000 cases/day average. Fauci acting like 100,000 ungodly number makes sense - we've already experienced that. 

Now certainly want 100,000 new cases/day 1,000 deaths/day Fauci purposefully misleading? everyone critical thinking ability potato? can't talk honestly openly risks virus?  real hardest hit virus working poor continued jobs grocery stores, pharmacies delivery jobs redditors could stay parents’ basements post righteous indignation people trying feed families. Nah, she'll right Exactly. admit, I'm privileged. However, left house go store (Home Depot wore mask) 4 months. restaurant all. order groceries online. support local restaurants ordering takeout couple times week tip least 20% every time. inside restaurant since early March. miss much, worth it. want drink, drink home husband.
