# speedy lockdowns save lives

# Early stay-at-home orders contained covid-19  SUMMER ARRIVED, Europeans Americans might hoped covid-free spell, deadly peaks spring distant memory. looks unlikely. New infection hotspots emerged Britain‚Äôs Midlands, Germany‚Äôs west throughout America. Even virus rampaging developing countries, people West worried second soon predict severe outbreaks be. Yet data first wave show important governments respond quickly. East Asian countries existing contact-tracing systems experience viral outbreaks contained covid-19 almost immediately. Western governments resorted blanket lockdowns, crippling economic side-effects. fastest contained disease effectively.  shows pattern clearly. Take Italy: Lombardy region hit sooner harder anywhere else continent, issued stay-at-home order relatively early, February 22nd. result, Italy‚Äôs south largely spared. pattern holds France, contained virus mostly Paris east. Germany, Austria Switzerland imposed national regional lockdowns recorded 60 deaths. contrast, Britain already 300 deaths March 23rd, government ordered people stay home. slow response allowed virus reach entire country: 90% Britons live region least 25 confirmed deaths per 100,000 residents. That, turn, made harder reopen country business. Sweden, impose lockdown all, suffered similarly widespread epidemic.   experience covid-19 complicated. first wave, primarily hit New York New Jersey, looks like Italy France. Stay-at-home orders, states issued early April, came late prevent lots deaths north-eastern cities soon enough protect rest country. However, whereas European countries closed borders other, half American states imposed restrictions interstate travel. many governors, wary political risks, chose relax lockdowns even confirmed cases reach new heights. Arizona, Florida Texas quickly, trying close shops restaurants again.  Imperial College London estimate Europe‚Äôs policies prevented 3m deaths May 4th. subnational data collected Economist suggest partly stay-at-home orders contained virus geographically. analysis covering 200 administrative units, American states Italian regions, found stay-at-home orders substantially reduced probability virus spreading new areas. Imposing restriction region fewer 100 cases knocks 50% chance reaching 25 deaths per 100,000 people next fortnight. Lockdowns blunt tools, save lives. ‚ñ†  Johns Hopkins University; WHO; EU; University Oxford; Flaxman et al. (2020); national statistical health agencies White House official released statement saying ‚Äúseveral White House officials concerned number times Dr. Fauci wrong things,‚Äù attaching lengthy list scientist‚Äôs comments early outbreak.

So they're releasing public statements undermining credibility public health officials? time public officials trying encourage wide uptake harm reduction measures?  hell reporting people government wearing mask? Yeah understand put people risk worn mask. end day everybody right wear mask. everybody right distance people. seems like another way Karen's world report people nothing. walk away somebody isnt wearing mask. High schoolers college students probably handle social distancing want 

I think can. little kids definitely can't, even HS fall victim. trying find girl make large part HS experience, doubt alone this. 

HS kids might theoretically capable keeping distant long period times, peer pressure environment. amazed americans still going around visiting this. 

It isnt masks - people crazy.

Also, US can‚Äôt even enforce mask order, way enforce strict shutdown rules, reality herd immunity seems best way forward possible bad outcomes. posted bunch mask stats
 
 nothing said challenges efficacy masks
 
 like one bit would rather obvious photo-op distract commutation one political allies. yeah. point, ""didn't sneeze veterans"" passes good news. put t-shirts? took kids theme park today. Walking temperatures checked told stand 1.5 metres apart rather scary security guards wearing black faceshields entrance. certainly look place kicking telling pick up... 

Once inside, half rides even open due safe social distancing. rest rides half seats available time wait much longer normal. staff wore faceshields felt really dystopian could tell want trying smile pretend happy. 

The majority customers adhere social distancing even though signs everywhere, none staff enforced it. constantly moving kids away people crowded around us. give evil stares quite would stay away. 

I personally regret going, kids fun though, I'm sure felt different them. 

BTW state NSW Australia 7 new cases today. US thinking this, worth it!

People like Trump rarely suffer like poors. field hospitals Iraq. response based given comment. back track comments subsequently that's you. huge chunk progressive heart Americans lazy fucking idiots don‚Äôt vote. America could easily beat GOP every time people actually fucking voted. gave America 20 years ago happily live country sanity now, AKA Canada. can‚Äôt stand America become. breaks heart constantly.  right wing purposefully politicising pandemic response. get ideas vacuum space, pushed people like Rush Limbaugh, Alex Jones fox news.

The disinformation causing behave like roots right wing punditry even comes Donald Trump called hoax.

The people might politically active following consuming right wing media social media. could set bar pro-mask usage. Everyone, princesses, dancers, Disney made hard line acted role model, could helped set expectations rest US, shifting Overton Window. 

But they‚Äôre showing mixed message ever. anti-mask idiots point unfortunate performers forced crowded park without mask Cinderella doesn‚Äôt wear mask. started wearing face mask safety goggles home. stories reminders thing really number people. attitude behavior got killed. I'm California. People take virus seriously here, serious enough. lot people know hanging out, going parties, going bars, care-free like man here. Well, yesterday, people tested positive COVID-19. rough day. expected get point. reckless. 

This virus getting closer closer. I'm going stay negative, even means wearing mask, safety goggles face shield home. 1% population *confirmed* American Exceptionalism, amirite? Late reality situation again.  Also, vast majority people drive drunk die. still shitty, selfish thing do. still results thousands unnecessary deaths perpetrators innocent victims year. Masks easy, fire forget type solutions. 

Social distancing staying 6‚Äô apart requires constant awareness, respect others ability count six, much less prevalent south. know, certainly concerning.

P.S. George Carlin great style, bad Reddit approved. Best could do.  would care universe thinks that? survive life threats hardship. Todays overprivileged fat dumbfucks idea human. confident body properly maintained sickness immune system kick virus overcome. many fine.

I agree saying many suffer much die, believe bodies properly maintained treated sick thus develop problems.  Same, culprits coworkers' kids. Stupid people put charge.
Same stupid people expected right thing?
Nah. Weed need! Lockdown ""brutal""? felt quite timid compared countries meaning far slower drop cases many European countries.

I'm big fan fifties sci-fi movies (I large collection) pretty much every movie scientist hero person military people go monologue great science progress get advice defeat baddie aliens. 1950's seems like bit golden age America war, due part scientific progress time I'd imagine wonder changed? Haha fucking chode are. Perfectly fine associated MAGA trolls Trump himself, someone calls bullshit online get butthurt ""liberal hostility"" . lying. one could reasonably anticipated disaster trump administration would be. Trump spent *years* office I'm still surprised appalled actions, behavior, failures regular basis. 

If believe this, paying attention. start could tell Trump listen anyone except (or people simply praised him.). guy never report anyone except father. Anybody thought ""here's real businessman"" deluding normal businessmen respond board directors shareholders.

Trump's one major policy issue (build wall) bordered comedy said Mexico would pay it. Remember claimed woukd replace Obamacare something better? zero information ""it'll terrific. It'll great!"" that's policy. 

Here's guy racially discriminated intentionally landlord fined it. fact refused admit guilt meaningless (although think high time quit allowing companies fined without admission guilt.) required admit guilt book tossed them. 

Trump terrible financial manager.  filed bankruptcy 4 times. Either manipulates system personal gain without caring anything else terrible managing money, both. 

Trumps reaction almost anything go way sue whoever thinks responsible. Go hunt around, find things like trump suing palm beach county like airplanes ruining ambiance estate.

Hes intolerant insulting extreme. know there's pile people love part personality, terrible trait politician stripe want succeed politician. good; wanted clarify everyone else case context lost.

Well, go again... Got little dribbling chin buddy. Goldman Asset managers already manage pension fund assets kind defeats entire comment. 

Furthermore, think Blackstones primary worry stock don‚Äôt know enough finance making comments Goldman wants pension funds. Done another photo op! Someone video theme darts Vader. Perfect fit  think may time pat back, see S.Korea, China, Vietnam publish pieces like this... realize -- probably simply cannot *fathom* -- fact media reported every flu death, we'd seeing exact stories every year. annual flu big deal (or least past... fear future), bother. know it, sent unreasonable panic.

50% COVID deaths US people **over 80 years old.** Another 25% people *between 70 79 years old.* *another* 12.5% people 60 69 years old (and many *all* groups co-morbidities like diabetes?)

That says 1/8th deaths people *aren't* senior citizens. Given estimated IFR COVID 0.26% -- 2.6 times worse flu -- numbers mean non-senior citizens, damn virus equivalent *less* deadly flu.

If reported every flu death 60 years age, every year we'd tons weak, frightened rabbits screaming shut society protect them. Fuck that. bunch people gave crap suggesting four months ago. close like get them. 

If stand behind trolley stand 6ft away them.

This works checkout lane, still gotta dodge plague bearers. gem.

I'm ashamed weak president, I'm DEFINITELY voting now. need strong president wear mask.

/s, sarcasm, rip apart. Although, I'm definitely voting sure. SUPER CORONA!!! Knew recognized band name! I‚Äôm honestly flabbergasted they‚Äôre now. Like seeing fans literally burning death wasn‚Äôt enough? Definitely ""picturebook"" move.  Tell Bolsonaro NY London UK good case studies understand post-pandemic, badly impacted?

I think answers obvious people think. really - previous outbreaks highly localized, really - mostly Kowloon, also cases infection source can't traced back multiple places territory.

I know people work CHP, can't work either. see detected COVID-19 infections week ago, infections people returning HK - suddenly lot unlinked local cases. say before? edited Make refuse wear masks volunteer hospitals.

Maybe America would better people stopped blaming omnipotent Russian plot America problems accept responsible failures.   Better call STARS that's dad saying IHOP. Can't people cook pancakes home? leaders started acknowledging problem beginning stating patriotic duty Americans come together fight this, protect fellow Americans, imagine many people would wearing masks today. Thanks. managed get N95 last week nurse friend I'm good there. Feel bad people arent lucky learned anything else rest world save lives, start now? Chicken pox also severe childhood thought people it. Surprised Pikachu meme. senior living facilities, background checks, drug screens, etc taking care (directly indirectly) need individuals. safety liability issue residents staff.

The training probably deal senior living facility. different skill set regular restaurant might need deal residents way need training. Drove before, seem inhabited? cases new cases cherry picked. don‚Äôt want go school seeing insane surge hit probably go cause parents don‚Äôt want homeschool Even zombie movie writers could envision thst people wpuld protesting right walk among zombies believe hoax. Ha got need 70 times

I know kidding, concerning math joke...

When US 500 cases total, would needed double cases 18 times order infect 70% population.

Reaching 1% population ate 10 doubles.

Now cases active anymore helps bit, take away 1 2 ""doubles"", reality same. ""1/70th way 70%"". We're lot closer halfway there.

Except Arizona.

Arizona ""officially"" 1.5%, hit testing bottleneck. People waiting line hours precious test kits used hold statewide shortage chemicals needed process them. probably hundreds thousands sick people part official numbers yet, contact tracers, already overwhelmed, can't keep up. exaggeration assume Arizona 5% active cases right now, doubling every 10 days background. Arizona respond week, able stop hitting 20%, IMO, momentum can't stopped dime. people incubating raise rates week two, matter strict make shutdown percentage people going flaunt make much harder hit brakes. take hospitalization percentage 5% 500,000 cases 25,000 hospitalization

TL;DR Arizona one week left avoid apocalypse shutting down. Trump took production back China! guys double triple number cases state registering per day, we‚Äôre slow walking back shutdown we‚Äôre idiots, okay. Hopefully you‚Äôre right! That's definitely part reason. UK included, also increase Europe's population 67 million. terms deaths per capita, think US already ahead, not, overtake soon. Europe's outbreak less screeched halt. According Worldometers, averaging \~400-500 per day, \~150 Russia, another \~100 UK. No, still stupid selfish. best everything. see include stupid. Well considering effective death rate US around 8% resolved cases. numbers going charts couple weeks. this? recent, I'd get checked. couple months ago, guess know now. really. know fact not, know fact there's less 69 times infect. much better estimates that. Working number way objectively wrong thing could do.

As people downvoting this, seriously? possibly even attempt actually defend position here? Y'all downright Trumpian.  see 3-4 weeks. pretty closely linked case rates + chance positive tests. like anyone managed separate vulnerable parts society protect well. get message idiots believe hoax. conversation guy said Fox News reporting it, propaganda believable. Truth Man mask really cutting oxygen brain isn‚Äôt it! people interested science. interested catchy headline suits agenda.

The mask thing heavily fueled conspiracy theories tend attract lot people necessarily stupid underlying mental conditions. one reason ridiculous extrapolate study way people keep doing. no, don‚Äôt understand. US big! mean cases big! Europe small! cases higher! Completely agree states stay home orders mask mandates Trump encouraged armed rebellions. actually looks presidential. ever really know mean Even so, number reported Coronavirus deaths died hospital it, home due it. know it‚Äôs reported, it‚Äôs still reasonable baseline, especially calculate 69x‚Äôs. summary, cases yes, deaths, yes. We‚Äôre still tracking worlds fatality rate. *shrug* Whatever helps sleep night, boss. Please, share story Covid+Fibro. Sounds ghastly.
One roommates tested positive asymptomatic (cluster job site), came quarantine, apartment locked 7 people. fibro. yeah freedom tho... might already many places. else surge cases nyc right now? Trump worst president ever. somehow politicized natural disasters. head fracture him. Setting public take blame infections 2nd wave come...  possibly (""just"") ADHD contracting virus spreading virus? Masks thought prevent spread. mask know actually helps contracting N95. heard opposite makes increase chance getting due positioning always touching it. Asking friend few* Florida Man, rescue!  pronounced free dumb. I'm sarcastically imitating anti-masker.


I told forced wear mask takes away freedom speech. can't compelled say virus real. love watching real time collapse America. Fucking beautiful Add Romania list. Lots people acting like... Florida. beaches full season, masks rarely seen. 

Also, viral misinformation circulating, often directly translated US sources. Yes, find conspiracy theorists talking Fauci Gates here. 

Our government also lost **the power quarantine people** recent Supreme Court ruling *freedom*, hospitals quarantine centers let thousands people, tested positive. come 65% figure? found much effectiveness masks, one better done ignorance, still bad, imagine person thinking would nearly effective lot 'lighter' 


dumb step  Also CCP I‚Äôm certain will. look republicans voted aid hurricane sandy Puerto Rico recently. cute rely heavily speculation wide ranging figures instead facts. Even 5% 20% means still many American deaths come. mention survivors health issues rest life. never hear anything Philippines, y‚Äôall doing? SIL Filipina. lost opportunity manipulate early on. literally anything ~~mommies approval~~ praise. dems media briefing Get want malignant narcissist coordinated could gotten literally anything wanted him. Don‚Äôt forget schools reopening soon! love US, close family visited frequently sadly feel find wanting visit again.  Love find never thought would say Greg Abbott good. Compared Arizona Florida‚Äôs governor, he‚Äôs good. yet enough organize groups uniquely American thing?

I can't find write-up anti-mask protests anywhere world except US.  Protests probably leading cause spread, special kind dense say tangible effect. Idk guy downvoted protests definitely contributing. Another article ignoring T-Cells. Don‚Äôt waste time. poor, likely exposed virus appears criteria reading this. researchers speak vaccine dose availability, speaking solely vaccine availability potential vaccines availability? 

Just wondering enough approved vaccines would mean sum could help get people vaccinated, makes sense.  Nuh uh! saw article written PhD Facebook page ""Only Real American Patriots"" says masks work actually hurt people. I'm informed, say confidently authority, liberals trying take away freedoms Americans. That's I'm voting Trump. problem nobody knows right now. antibodies may last 2 weeks 2 years 2 decades. really need vaccine best shot returning something normal. wearing masks social distancing. Stay safe people!  told followers earlier liberals hate masks... could game changer situation problem too. can't online classes. Especially science classes. Plus feel isolated. 137,000 deaths far, that's representative 1% total... lose money brand tarnishing? Small bump road compared money lose keeping parks closed.

Edit: I‚Äôm favor opening parks, wanted point Disney whatever interest share holders. think Disney spike mostly think people live there. go get sick Disney go home Idaho Disney outbreak. outbreak town. think hard pin anything Disney people traveling across country taking planes such. says got Haunted Mansion? Hmm went lot places.  


I love Disney. I've watching parades youtube little virtual vacations. hope everyone today manages stay healthy. Source? Yoikes remember using unexcused absences school year early October 10 years ago. Almost lines all, amazing. mean, within Democratic party's best interest increase voting since states try limit voting favor Republicans. complaining two-party system going fix anything. one going vote third party. No, hell-like heat makes standing lines tolerable, rather solely concentrating fuck spent $100/head stand line 8 hours 12 I‚Äôm here, you‚Äôre like fucking hot. still cant believe people think corona fake:/ Unfortunately I‚Äôve issues eyes since high school (30 now). It‚Äôs combination rheumatoid arthritis allergies. also get scleritis every years, painful pink eye. I‚Äôve adjusted never able wear contacts don‚Äôt need reverse psychology him. need regular psychology. mean average death rate climbed 500 day week ago, 725 day now. also close reaching average 60k new cases day still climbing. 

So there's that... OSHA lifted relaxed tons policies INB4 false reports someone doesn‚Äôt like someone screw them. like abused red flag laws. really telling start gloating glad cult morons start wearing masks now. Weed Millennial alternative medicine, there‚Äôs benefits lot substances it‚Äôs really special Trump. long arduous ICU stay. Yeah kinda wanted say something too, situation really seem normal me. I'm qualified say anything though I'm glad showed :) 10 billion per day! hard understand mask production ramped medical professionals required them. Selfish Americans would bought leaving none risk. need example look toilet paper. optimism either lack information denial coping mechanisms 

A lot people gotten life rather successfully behaving certain way faced change double old ways since worked well doubling anything usually leads results go something life leads result instead going half assed

But there's exceptions every rule house always wins... Gamble enough double enough eventually lose maybe lose big. Especially game rigged (coronavirus, evolved goddamn bat, no/rare/ineffective treatment, vaccine human being's biggest organ brain rendered useless well theoretically useless since social distancing masks work).

Another possibility abuse statistics like death rate... would like see data disabled rate. Maybe people saying 1% death rate would change minds 10% crippled, low quality life forever, wheezing forever, brain damage organ damage on. read somewhere based antibodies CDC estimates 10 times amount actual cases U.S. true number would 1 10 Maybe instead relying hope America taken aggressive action achieve desirable outcome situation... looking recent American history appears theme. Yeah apparently Phase 4 means pandemic return lives normal. optimistic future unfortunately. bad 1% deserve infected  Gonna shove resistor ass, looks like. friend Sydney, Australia said (Have?) high fines breaking pandemic safety rules. $11,000. said told call scofflaws. Can't wait anti maskers come full 180 u-turn wearing mask recommended numbers you‚Äôve furnished based one-year interval. 

The first case reported US 6 months ago. Going straight line interpolation, death rate much higher accidents respiratory illness. Based case growth, likely much higher. both. Combined. sure downvoted. wondered ""missed"" cases would alter fatality rate. Never hurts analyze data.  Disney resorts could theoretically question it, think use driver's licenses forms ID state them. see asking many question turn guest. would even work? They'd say, ""You stay hotel go parks""?

Edit: plus probably often case someone living another state part-time part-time Florida legitimately NJ whever past 14 days. agree, except think there's set definition first wave. graph deaths shape wave, graph cases isn't.

Also, I'd like ask: 'verified specialist - epidemiologist', r/coronavirus never r/COVID19? get user flair subreddit? Started 10, switching back forth 10 11 entire time every day since beginning March. OK I'm scared Congratulations! avoided wasting time finding one take action red flag.  Agreed. dumb conservatives don‚Äôt wear masks

It‚Äôs always back who‚Äôs less scientific sides 

Politics shit show talking [literally sad say sometimes. However, fungal infection won‚Äôt go away, even nose (away customers) two shifts masks=three days spots itchy oozing. Thank goodness heavy duty makeup.

I hate looking like ass, I‚Äôm also going ever speak lovely medical issue public. I‚Äôm terrified ever receive massage bad.

Asymptomatic carriers incubation time. states refused learn anything

it's almost like virus spread Asia Europe Americas, except countries shut borders go mask Florida. also go mask Florida. define ‚Äúquite low‚Äù? Even it‚Äôs 5-10% (and 0.5-1% death rate seems quite likely low) that‚Äôs enormous. Probably inner circle realizing wearing mask help hurt November. suggesting cases uncle's death listed covid related?

If so, opinion incredibly irresponsible. inflates numbers. Extrapolating type diagnosis give us accurate representation actual seriousness virus. would suggest said uncles passing included one would need find attribute data increased current future suicides health issues would negated otherwise. would next impossible accurately compile information. related social economic sense physical sense.

If that's saying sorry little rant. Yeah depends r0 understand. estimates number vary wildly country country even within guarantee won‚Äôt get re-elected. fact it‚Äôs likely win slim margin similar way. 

And loses try January? I‚Äôve waiting two weeks far Florida sign weakness. Nope city council voted approve couple weeks ago last heard still going happen school admin proposing sorts standards mask, eventually settled ‚Äújust let kids express themselves, they‚Äôll likely wear then.‚Äù rule vulgar. even ""Let's open schools"" ""Let's open school deal guidelines they're difficult expensive."" usually likes pay sex eastern European hookers. ask Melania. clarify I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt get all. do. Obviously. don‚Äôt get level adults, symptomatic degree adults, don‚Äôt spread well adults. Therefore, RELATIVE risk school much lower bar high risk activity (church singing, concerts singing, bars, nightclubs). war drugs, war poverty, war abstract concepts right? looks like Muton X-COM Sorry. can't read that. know mean long time ago. pandemic widespread 3 months school closed past 3 months U.S. There's several stories places camps kids camped disease spread. know evidence need. saying defies logic diseases work. bank it. schools open, close teachers administration people get disease kids get it. like camps summer bunch kids getting it. 11,000 children Florida gotten this. guess magically spread it? Again, logic that! Get well soon! guy downplayed virus since beginning even said wear mask wearing one know shit fucked. Well never showed Instagram video
Of incident. it!!!!! know case either due current suggestions people never actually recovered first time (I can't read article know symptoms June) test measured dead virus? went late October really nice  teaching degree, moment I'm thankful teaching job. I'd absolutely resigning position asked work given circumstances.

That's death sentence, IMO. Breaking News: Trump follows rule. :), wow! you‚Äôre brilliant addition human race! may next Albert Einstein genius thoughts yours. heard like tiny canned mushrooms. say never got better many us almost 98% recovered. Look bodypolitic slack. 
I've started recovering near 4 months suffering myriad symptoms. Redemption arc? used think that, hope. would easy claim, something else called Covid *conspiracy* reasons.

We going suddenly see mask usage amongst populace opposing neighbor grandma died.

Unless, propaganda masks makes 180 encourages instead, unlikely happen. already known long time. I'm confused. Literally research saw masks said virus stayed air like 3 4 hours, saw weeks ago  saw Lowe‚Äôs yesterday, first time I‚Äôve seen anywhere since March. god think Station Fire they‚Äôd little careful. early studies done it. üëé? Japan, Australia, Vietnam, New Zealand, South Korea, Thailand, Sri Lanka is, there's bitter Canadian bigotry knew underneath surface. Loser. woof :/  5 year old smart. Mine would try eat dirt. supported widespread mask usage worldwide shortage masks time, would trigger rush masks global big player exacerbate shortage (we saw happened hydroxychloroqine remdesivir). 
Medical workers get masks, primary response workers getting sick and/or refusing work. 

Where exactly road take you, friend. Given job, I'm surprised jumped straight fury. mention resistance met administration. 

Furthermore, studies time showing mask benefit helping (study South Korea published March can't bothered retrieve). recent evidence changed this. Even now, proper mask use effective. Improper mask use puts wearer higher risk. Asian countries familiar proper mask use. harder decision get non familiar population wear one properly. don‚Äôt see people would want go Disney land pandemic. it‚Äôs obviously money grab Disney. human cost issue comes corporations making money. know looks stupid wearing mask, Trump? wearing max 137,000 American deaths. will. That's guaranteed happen. still unknown base would follow suit. Even Annoying Orange wearing mask, still uncomfortable wearing masks constant reminder change lifestyle condition. base would board 180 degrees turn. people going Disney world don‚Äôt see problem? used guinea pig perfectly fine. Smh Could medical facility? Wouldnt require mask enter? (Not trump fan, wondering really voluntarily) everyone keeps forgetting long term effects COVID. cold. Everyone ‚Äúrecovers‚Äù permanent damage. Lungs, liver, kidneys, brain, heart &amp; GI. 40 co workers personally know it. F‚Äôd up. Getting data back timely fashion vs simply taking test kinda paramount importance Hence quotation marks, although numbers necessarily correct. There's really much symptoms, testing people without symptoms generally frowned upon. 

In addition, really problem much better isolate people many. goal get exact count, keep many carriers possible away others, making overshooting percent two better not. keep mind, areas US alright moment. 

That means, COVID hotspot, likely much 1 100 people. Ok prove video doesn‚Äôt exist??? great! Well sorry. I've seen like 5 posts FL surpassing 15,000 cases last 5 minutes page, click articles.  link? would love see methodology. think estimate flu estimate virus. Also virus contagious spread, help slow rate spread hope herd immunity works. yet hear anyone claim causes long term lung damage everyone infected would interested know got little piece information, also difficulty breathing happens flu people risk, plus difficulty breathing isnt often covid patients. comment one linked saying Disney surely wouldn‚Äôt open. Aged like milk. ton mobile home / retirement communities get cheap mobile home 40k. Especially eastern Mesa Yeah, Florida's top data scientist fired refused cook books. students dont. teachers dont. government does. May suggest get Blood O2 finger monitor, cheap drug stores. Find threshold safety, thus if/when go back hospital. catch it, I'm gonna test frequently, seems sneaky factor experienced differently person person. think paid $20 mine. wipe food soap water. Clothing goes directly washing machine. Shoes purses get sprayed.

I put chemicals food. 

There's much do. Same. Got sick end March coughing since end sight. still exercise half amount time used I'm completely breath. lucky enough hospitalized shit joke. quote Nike shirt used see people wear gym:

Every. Damn. Day. GOP convention. think they're trolling? seemed genuine yeah need waste time obvious trolls. many people minds made regarding covid amount evidence change minds. People open minds far  little self reflection see. 300% deaths happend New York hospitals overrun bodies stored cooling containers. Texas Florida reaching hospital capacity. Perhaps even more, there‚Äôs still lag 4th July parties Yeah I'm getting downvoted üòÅ

Not lot fans here... Maga people could‚Äôve proudly wearing Maga masks whole time smh. Texas setting daily records coronovirus hospitalizations. hit record deaths send 40 50 articles would like. Oxford vaccine co-developed AstraZeneca. Well I've never seen plants grow toilet. dont understand florida Disney's going real deep penetrating cleaning. Apparently 70k US tourists turned back Canadian border long weekend. Time second opinion new doctor Different set circumstances. New York hit 12k 30k tests pretty much 40 percent positives.

This 15k 100k ish 15 percent Labs still choked, 20% positive. Healthcare choked, hundreds in, hundreds out, hundreds turned away ER thing keep bed count level.

Arizona usually report deaths Sunday Monday see is. Maybe ordered coroner work more. *‚ÄùOne last time*

*Relax, drink me*

*One last time*

*Let‚Äôs catch COVID tonight*

*And we‚Äôll teach kids say goodbye*

*To say goodbye*

*To I‚Äù*

(a take ‚ÄúOne Last Time‚Äù Hamilton) [Arm thought manager blaming *symptoms* HRT, literally told employees trans woman *died* HRT!  person diagnosed COVID-19 today, actually prescribed treatment based phase illness? 

When tested March, medical staff administered test said test came back positive, basically fight off. Fortunately, test came back negative. changed? Self-quarantine immediately avoid inadvertently spreading further. Get tested soon show symptoms, 10-14 days exposure, whichever comes first. test early, get negative result anyway may get false sense security. Good ideas, people would voluntarily things. (Instead taking court) Inconvenience would definitely deter large majority. guess DeSantis right said Florida wouldnt look like Italy New York. looks worse. added leadership acting like nothing going wrong. Things locked March would mostly thing past now. LOVE Andy, mandate happened months ago. Isn‚Äôt nice benefit hindsight understanding institutions work? Armchair leaders smh. got back 9 day camping trip. Saw like two people whole time.

the amount people wearing stores annoyingly high. many fucking people planet anyway.   
Old people stupid people reason shit sucks anyways. 

They voted Ducey, Arpaio, Trump.   
They're ones fucking wearing masks. fuck care live die? they're human? Fuck no. Let Darwinism take over. hot cov, hot cov, hot covidee dog!
hot cov, hot cov, hot covidee dog!
We're splitting scene
We're full beans! sad part people need hear listen.

People yourself. UK deaths per person USA. Unfortunately ban straight forward ""Americans banned EU"" pretty complicated. Pretty much Ireland Schengen area tend things way since we're island (mostly island since UK exists, that's even complicated)

We got new government 5 months trying form one new government charge currently completely spineless banning American travel. check /r/ireland see pissed are. Children 8 year old people certain medical conditions exempt right far inaccuracy due delays death registrations. try compensate this. I'd surprised estimate turns completely off. think governors trying, live Washington state, hit first, large city international links, yet kept curve flat.

It seems governor R name leads bad outcomes though. I‚Äôm discouraged hear that, surprised. friend‚Äôs sister charge nurse hospital central Illinois believes whole pandemic blown proportion liberals want hurt Trump‚Äôs chance re-election. number people medical education professions hold similar beliefs mind-boggling. Yup. Yesterday 114 9pm working outside it‚Äôs hot it‚Äôs bad summer. first time I've ever seen slavery apologist wild. 

Yikes.  two families bubble socially distance (everyone quarantined properly first 6 weeks so) friends I'll meet outside couple beers sit close together (but probably less 6 feet). going take 10 years. US population going drop 3 percent year, isnt something hide. Going +2 million growth year -13 million next going noticeable. That's fair argument, thanks reply. good answer straightforward solution. actually washed them. keep rotation going repeat one 4 5 days many middle managers unable 'walk floor' afraid higher ups realize little required. always loudest voices working home.

Worsened quality life observed among 44.1% patients. assessment took place average 60 days first symptoms appeared. scientist engineer. ECONOMY!!! Well wouldn‚Äôt first place tried join hitler world takeover. honestly creeps out. feels like really really bad nightmare joke article lol it? 7k deductible would/does cripple average American. Yes. case COVID-19, vaccine, multiple strains, knowledge long 'immunity' might be. risk worth taking. people commenting could slightly intelligent, are. live AZ, work group home. residents ask ""when get go again?"", sit tell ""I know"". Meanwhile continue work pandemic, try continue function without succumbing horrified panic sorrow, news gets grim. 

People dying, general public seem just... care. 

Individualism destroying empathy one another. Capitalism leaving people fend profit driven systems suck us dry force people work desperation. 

Social Darwinism apparent loud government shock seclusion political officials reveling idea poor need might culled time over. 

Fuck United States America, fuck Trump, fuck self centered assholes stain society inflict plague others ""freedom"".

I wish time grieve lost country become. Abraham Lincoln right. America destroyed outside invader, destroyed itself. Honestly feel bad guys much easy satisfactory act smug shit talk Americans this, basic truth I'm sure European democracies would much resilient.

Sure, there's inherent weakness US political system due insane duopolism, overall, example France Macron Russian plant instead usual product wealthy elites, could it? even real impeachment process, reserved cases President basically incapable assuming office (meaning, they're ill). best idea among pandemic People Florida city saying results taking 9+ days. getting delayed. Like many Americans, selfish baby. want impress upon others thinking virus isn‚Äôt big deal. feel hopeless going work everyday place people dont care country literally fucked people's ignorance. gotta leave work guess. status hospitals Florida? know Texas struggling doesn‚Äôt seem overwhelming Florida (yet)? fact bazillion scientists/resources/money thrown covid one? SARS 1 vaccine completed largely due lack priority, due impossible. Sars fizzled sense urgency went funding subsequently dropped too. 

Which still guarantee succeed covid, yeah. people can't read Organized murderers DT knows. DT care. WH reportedly counting people becoming numb deaths. DT willing sacrifice loved ones long wins Nov. Nov, win lose, care many people die.

Opening schools places work would kill hundreds thousands he'll get claim reopened economy people vote  AZ incredibly hot dangerously blazing sun summer, people indoors more, likely spread virus result

Sort opposite Europe, really. expect we'll get asses kicked November gets cold people move inside again. source clear cut statement said, covers N95 medical grade masks.  Biden running liberal platform since FDR ourworldindata graph confirmed deaths, confirmed cases, lag w.r.t. excess mortality. looks like I'd expect shape-wise. Sweden starts taking relative Nordic countries around start week 13 (couple weeks introduced restrictions), time start getting excess mortality Sweden show Nordic countries.

Would need something quantitative, shape-wise looks like I'd expect.

Basically, take anything comes Johan Carlson's mouth *massive* grain salt. guy's trying put blame elderly care earlier too, obviously bs. revealing terrible data actual increase cases? personally didn‚Äôt vote Liberals still far better option Scheer much like Trump smart. think agree countries stupid corrupt leadership. significantly less sociopathic greedy. honestly don‚Äôt wish ill Americans actually family there. us favour; please safe get control like happens affects us well No, didn't. illiterate. Deaths clearly rise. sad thing is- deaths likely last week death data typically lags week. hope people staying home point.

No. That's biology works. real world, sci-fi television show. supposed moving NYC FL. supposed quarantine two weeks rich? need look apartments. can't stay friends even risk walking building giving somebody. NY State offering way people safely quarantine. Affordable Air BnBs see shared rooms apartments. tell supposed bring virus me? Sleep car shit street?  Literally feel someone CFS. I'm concerned virus like, I'm literally bed day, die, what? Gop voters think covid like migrant caravan disappear election US went wrong:

Giving citizens $1200 Lump sum letting banks take it.

Ontario (Canada) gave qualified out-of-work citizens $2,000/mo ($1.8k tax) PER month, back working. It‚Äôs far survivable enticing compliance actually makes people sheltering-in-place comfortable so.

Can‚Äôt believe US behaves it‚Äôs citizens. get protesting now. watch CBS world news everyday. reporting type things see Reddit. men small hands wear masks Britain actually done great past 3 months. course, using masks public spaces would help eliminating virus completely. Thanks! lot people America weird personality flaw they'll harm others spite someone dares infringe ""freedom"". I'm somewhat sympathetic, also health insurance cover intentionally getting sick pandemic.  Lol nice try understand that, deaths seeing today 4 weeks ago. diamond princess cruise set sail Jan 20th first recorded death Feb 20th.

If City downtrend, seems like was, deaths go while, even new cases rise. takes pipeline build. bet could look numbers are, total hospitalizations trending down, slightly new hospitalizations grown 7 day moving average. significantly, maybe 25 hospitalizations day 30. 

Nothing significant, overtime, new cases continue grow, pipeline get filled new hospitalizations take old cases released hospital.

It takes time. deaths seeing today 4 weeks ago. 

I live Wisconsin, great virus month ago, today deaths low, new cases risen last two weeks. new rise cases won‚Äôt start showing deaths another two weeks. New hospitalizations starting rise, old hospitalizations getting released, total hospitalizations break even. new hospitalizations rising continue too, new cases surpass old cases problem evident. 

Wisconsin nearly beat virus, would stayed locked June 1st everyone wore masks public, virus would contained. slowly last 5 weeks gained steam, old cases resolved new cases started gain strength. first weeks virus replacing itself, two steps forward, one step back, time new cases grown eclipse past level deaths. 

It takes time grow, gets large enough enough transmission, starts take over, people stress exponential growth. 1 2, big deal. 2-4 concern. 4-16, bad lag deaths. 16-128, bad still small numbers. 128- 640, still bad deaths still declining.

This at. ‚ÄúHampton‚Äôs Panic‚Äù? like scientific theory something stop worry smudging makeup? Probably fact police departments receive multiple times amount budget education system‚Äôs do... Thanks much detailed info!  ""It's flu bro""  Waiting news lots anti-maskers getting infected hospitalized. way get get infected, even would spread many lots would suffered stupidity. I'm guessing complacency terms prevention efforts Scot here. England fucked, Scotland zero coronavirus-related deaths last 3 days, daily cases pretty much single figures.  shame really!  Natural selection action JESUS ChriSt, save us. thing horrible. horrible. many stories people believing thinking it‚Äôs hoax dying. It‚Äôs hard. family yes...but obviously didn‚Äôt care think wearing mask go market much bother hang there, dude. day 122 recovery tachycardia breathing issues problems steadily, slowly improving. There's group staked territory back China. They've never changed. ""Can't happen here.""

To support narrative first cherry pick one two pieces evidence thousands, compare apples oranges. idea (based one two bad antibody tests) 40% New York infected, true herd immunity threshold 20% (there bit overshoot guess). people died died conspiracy mislabel deaths, also sending people would died year anyway back homes infected. think IFR disease like 0.02%. claim maybe bit higher flu (comparing apples oranges - flu estimates). claim actually less flu.

They believe virus run rampant peaked Sweded, Japan countries things like lockdowns completely irrelevant.

They think virus kill thousand people hundreds millions (accounting fake deaths nursing home mistakes), we'll herd immunity go away.

They also assume evidence contrary massive media conspiracy get Trump.

&amp;#x200B;

I think mentality go away, lose lot steam next tragic month probably hundreds thousands die.  recovered covid still wear mask. Got atleast 3 reinfections county people seen wearing masks. 

Problem abundance misinformation lack actual details virus explained general public. top current political climate we‚Äôre SUPER lucky isn‚Äôt Spanish flu Thanks much responding. 5-year-old-son, father nearly dying arrhythmia (he's 67, Mr grandfather died 55 same), service-related asymptomatic asthma, wife chronic bronchitis lymphoma (and who's chemotherapy), sister chronic bronchitis. 

I can't afford **NOT** leave house, I'm essentially *least* sick among us. Wearing mask **ISN'T OPTIONAL** county. ***I still regularly see people without one.***

Please, folks, protect around you. ***IT'S YOU, EVERYONE AROUND YOU!*** I'd guess LDS -- even they're minority within faith. Yes. Use sanitizer clean common surfaces. Take precautions, don‚Äôt drive crazy it. People ignore social distancing safety huge problem, possible cautious little paranoid. live life. Everything described perfectly reasonable. safe, doesn‚Äôt mean locking houses coming (hopefully) vaccine. balance. MAGA masks yes, wonder come one group use opportunity make extra (b?)millions pandemic? Everyone applaud, big boy put mask... point tens thousands people dying region due NYC's outbreak? that's exactly happened. get pretty upset people say ""it's flu"" spewing stuff getting immunity wearing masks etc. CFS literally ruined life, 8and seeing people willy nilly COVID honestly bothers me. difficult people understand bad CFS is, worthless feel bored unwell like 'you're faking it' (not mention judgement people ""lazy""). devistating illness makes sad see people reckless.

My hope generates research condition. No, mandatory Scotland shops public transport. Thanks.

It super prevalent. Post exertional malaise federal government gutted hollowed past number decades, Trump accelerated extreme. OSHA show basically. Can't enforce people/budget! People making argument disease spread protestors, anyone else's fault deliberately ignore said.

With said, worse protests. many people one place protestors could dreamed of, even capacity limits. lines pack people closer together longer period time protestors tended be. rides going point contact shared probably 15 people hour unless wiping vehicle every time someone leaves, even guardrails lines basically continuously contacted people waiting throughout day, protests part involved little contact. plenty indoor rides, restaurants, shopping protests almost exclusively outdoors, Disney even public transit system busses monorails people contaminate. Add fact people several times longer per day basically anyone spent protest fact coming world so, obvious disaster importing covid surrounding area spike well rest US, spreading efficiently basically anything short indoor concert covid party, exporting anywhere dumb enough let tourists return.

I‚Äôm welcoming different ideas, ask elaboration explanation get nonsense insults ascribe person bad argument inability articulate it. matter though, don‚Äôt think world leaders would take experimental vaccines, probably least likely people early testing, scientists wouldn‚Äôt know side effects it‚Äôs efficacy, would want know safe effective giving someone important Soon we‚Äôll havin Oleg cheese bagels breakfast ^(i visit often get daily dose public health insight.) Pretty soon everyone HUGE dangers Canada using USA yardstick success failure. seems general attitude Canada ""we're better USA we're well"". Numbers may declining high. Use worldometers.info find meaningful comparisons. Masks daily health recommendation China due pollution. Coronavirus didn‚Äôt change that. Lol 27 seconds in. guy turns around, wide-eyed, mom says ""She super sick, y'all... SUPER SICK."" unfunny... somehow funny. Last time saw exact look Far Side cartoon late 1980s. Probably involving cow piloting plane something like that. part makes worse acknowledges people infected *should* wear masks. Yet knew impossible determine everyone infected, thus reason dictates wearing masks beginning. hard figure out. UN world police, little leverage developed countries, much less United States. seems Governor DeSantis' strategy ignoring minimizing clear science evidence, working. 2 months ago thought face masks nothing. Science discussion open evidence disprove people rather shut everything down. truth fear criticism send Trump DeSantis crowdsurfing idiot supporters think hoax now? Yeah right leftist media distraction killing people around world distract delusions. Funny virus spreads worst conservative lead countries yeah drug addict idiot calls leftist media sheme. truly worthless human shells like walking earth. 15,000 plus daily assume go public potentially exposed virus. Contact tracing needed. currently get day testing instantly phone anywhere LA country, like months. sis know talking Here's another thing think about, continue hear opening schools come September. 

The talk children young age group bad carriers spreaders Covid-19. I've seen read, data coming either early studies seas. things is, know children, close quarters school setting fare, school setting since whole things started. 

So how, really know, spread around like wildfire. I've posted threads, children spread everything else that's respiratory virus otherwise, Covid-19, effectively halted entire world economy, magically spread kids come September?

I look forward September... Probably visit friend Ireland avoid mess US.  though? you‚Äôre going let narrative Trump fixed pandemic savior wins re-election it, that‚Äôs good deal.  Rest peace gonna say anything again. want risk safety. Shame love beaches Florida July. They're blast. $40 park. That‚Äôs it. He's smart enough talk things know. Soon become Good Mourning America. 40% vs. around 1% And? NY without doubt worse outcome mean shittier job. NY dealt terrible hand comparison Florida. population density major cities much higher NY Florida. Public transportation much popular NY Florida. hit 3-4 months earlier Florida. gives Florida time learn better treat sick patients, gather PPE set bed/facilities treat covid patients. one downside Florida going age population higher.


Some factors take account significant amount cases Florida early stages infected. time goes deaths happen. Whereas majority NY cases resolved. want note, believe NY true cases much much higher reported. early stages pandemic, positivity rate covid test like 50%. adequate testing capabilities. better testing, death covid case ratio would lower. US actually one countries without universal healthcare. Even South America, majority Asia it. Really tells lot states... Plus, imagine good state like California could perpetually wealth ravaged gop feds no, must die economy. Unfortunately deaths come later.

Unless Florida keeps reporting absurdly high ""Pneumonia"" death done last months. totally dependent population following safety measures. let leave shithole country work multiple hospitals per day like myself. I‚Äôm exposed tons people every day. every two weeks useless repeat question; Europe deliberately put Covid patients nursing homes?

If answer no, cannot simply ignore actions NY NJ making comparisons. countries better US, hard believe. Japanese particular strong cultural ethos social compliance cooperation. 

The *novel* coronavirus spreading fast *because* new. Japanese managed recent exposure something similar without anyone knowing. work like that. Positivity rate 10.5% 'People want masks . told Wear Masks! biggest beautiful masks. know lot vrilology, doctors! ' wife? also second lowest testing rate per capita states territories. Germany peaked 7k daily cases late March/early April 83mio inhabitants compared Florida's 21mio's. hope virus strain spreading America less deadly compared European one. 1. learn damn thing New York? fucking shipping truckloads bodies out. 
2. summer, probably best case scenario. November, couldn‚Äôt imagine bad Florida would be. thank you.  people can‚Äôt see difficulty dealing things like daily basis. boot licker here, theres gotta nearly much citizen behavior problem police behavior problem. mean something stupid like that, meant going hikes walks, hunting, finishing, canoeing etc. There's plenty safe activities. We‚Äôre lying Fauci said anyone *wanted* wear mask could wear one, **and** it‚Äôs important conserve medical PPE? looks like took advice. need look typical rate/number deaths. People die ‚Äúaverage‚Äù rate. current feats higher average, therein may lie true number feats. one point, average Floridian got higher national average show higher death rate? Central valley Cali checking in, 8 day wait get test right taking 7+ results. Basically worthless... Asymptomatic pre-symptomatic? know yet? part prevalent these. here. Best Coast gonna secede move . rest country mostly dead weight harmony brand pro science, pro culture dangerous socialism Man would really love country accessible affordable healthcare system. 

This fucked. Right? Thats scary. I'm 42, fat diabetic. hear us diabetes huge risk factor. I'm honestly really scared getting it. intentionally lying? Deaths going Georgia. side effects similar minor radiation exposure, body recovers own, would take vaccine day 1. 

I‚Äôm X-ray tech chest X-ray barely radiation all. 

That said. seems rushed Yeah that's excellent illustration stupid govts reactions been, cheers   RemindMe! 1 week I‚Äôm right-wing, right. Here‚Äôs direct link video.  That's good enough, pretty much unlimited looking post Reddit people saying things like, ""I would wear mask safer, governor saying wear mask refuse so."" Like, can't even comprehend level stupidity. know Americans stupid, fuck's sake, get shit together America. Compared previous years average pneumonia deaths last three months Florida? one 3.69/week paywall Texas. fuck ton COVID. crazy thing real number probably way higher. 

This thing isn‚Äôt getting better, honestly, anyone expecting to?  I‚Äôve work job 100% doable home commander didn‚Äôt care neither AETC commanders generals. Luckily one infected yet close calls nope report work 0730 prepared work shoulder shoulder worth mentioning none states listed part EU Armenia Europe. People would average tested least week infected.  lot election tampering 2 years. There's another shortage PPE... lie worth spike 15,000 confirmed cases coronavirus florida today? 

Was lie worth spike cases California too?

It would different story lie paid didn't. Look state America many people still wear masks. Thanks Fauci!  federal funds school district gets pay free lunch/breakfast students poverty pay special education. outstanding piece. scientist speculates lot new ""cases"" simply people -- pre-existing immunity coronaviruses -- fought virus, experienced minimal disease. testing ""positive"" due ""viral debris."" seems lot compelling MaGiC vIrUs spreads asymptomatically -- author says ""asymptomatic spreaders"" probably sore throat minor pain notice forgot -- like succinct brief summary, especially immunity deniers, humans attacked germs react them: pathogenic viruses environment, humans ‚Äî whether immune ‚Äî attacked virus. someone immune, battle virus begins. First try prevent virus binding cells help antibodies. normally works partially, blocked viruses attach appropriate cells. doesn‚Äôt need lead symptoms, it‚Äôs also disease. second guard immune system called action. That‚Äôs mentioned T-cells, white blood cells, determine outside cells virus hiding multiply. cells, incubating virus, searched throughout entire body killed T-cells last virus dead.  PCR corona test immune person, virus detected, small shattered part viral genome. test comes back positive long tiny shattered parts virus left. Correct: Even infectious viruses long dead, corona test come back positive, PCR method multiplies even tiny fraction viral genetic material enough \[to detected\].** That‚Äôs exactly happened, global news, even shared WHO, 200 Koreans already went Covid-19 infected second time therefore probably immunity virus. explanation really happened apology came later, clear immune Koreans perfectly healthy short battle virus. crux virus debris registered overly sensitive test therefore came back ‚Äúpositive‚Äù. **It likely large number daily reported infection numbers purely due viral debris.**  PCR test extreme sensitivity initially perfect find virus could be. test identify whether virus still alive, i.e. still infectous. Unfortunately, also led virologists equate strength test result viral load, i.e. amount virus someone breathe out. Luckily, day care centres stayed open nontheless. Since German virologist missed part, because, principle, look countries doing, even countries‚Äô case numbers falling rapidly. doubt far many banking economy recover virus rages, problem right can't spread controlled. Ah that's good know. realize posted. ....that‚Äôs going go well. stand chance. Sadly, many similarly situated Americans facing odds. Cool. That‚Äôs said, too. 

Anyone wanted wear mask could so. also strongly encouraged social distancing. **At time**, urgent need help conserve medical PPE. 

Fauci didn‚Äôt approve national guidelines. **Our president did.** They've lying take testing numbers positive numbers, match positive rate report. instead we'll spend money risk lives bus drivers, cafeteria staff, janitors, secretaries? can't go back business usual, feasible. Schools ability enforce social distancing cleaning much necessary. 

The problem schools. problem liar chief fighting spent speech Mount Rushmore trashing schools. No. time say ‚Äúwow great job‚Äù. It‚Äôs time say ‚Äúoh finally wearing mask? Fucking moron took four months realize one simple thing could saved thousands upon thousands lives hadn‚Äôt fucking petty earlier‚Äù. mean seriously, message could possibly have? I'd rather jump.

The days Jonas Salk-esque scientists assigning patents life saving drugs long-gone, I'm afraid. wonder think it‚Äôs real now? article recently stating exact opposite? think applies N95? Yeah last comment pretty much confirms it. couple brainless online trolls, nothing see folks. say otherwise? That‚Äôs break even capacity insanely low.  Let's go World Land?

Yes appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Vegans like make people hate us. stop. acting superior isn‚Äôt helping case here. clickbait. vaccine that's 100% effective. Even tested ones like 90-95% effective say nothing flu shot. even think Oxford, frontrunner, going 100%. fact even article says it

So even guy talking saying one works would likely long like effective enough
 
You know, next negative trend, least glad I'm seeing ""There never vaccine ever"" articles anymore plan tremendously good!! Tremendously. best tremendous plan anywhere. said tremendous?

What US even approach. Europe combined day around 15,800 new cases reported.. Europe around 742 million citizens Florida 22 million...

The US almost time x4 significant statistic per capita compared germany. also statistic used beginning cause everything irrelevant.

But, didn‚Äôt 6 months expenses saved going (when everything normal) living means. Honestly terrifying showing sign declining speed still steadily going up. cannot get we've gone million single week might even hit TWO million week August :( No, like reddit scientists go beyond try karma whore misrepresent logic reasoning.

Don‚Äôt forget us subs! 

Personally, going wait weeks beginning school year (if reopen) see happens. Then, probably limit jobs one school instead going district. feels bit selfish even writing honestly, older parents roommate don‚Äôt want expose. Plus, would hate spread germs among classrooms!!

They're even taking Warp Speed money produce candidate own. biotechs, think they're pump-and-dumping It‚Äôs issue loves see problems necessarily. could past people particularly vulnerable today common cold coronaviruses died left gene pool. descendants survivors resistance cold viruses. That's evolution works. ones handle disappeared. may seeing major culling human race. Whoever cannot handle coronavirus may disappear gene pool. wonder effects kids stuck home iso stressed parents. know really difficult some, including single parents. might like generation grew WW2. know affected parents. they're open, need money? stay closed safe, use money needed like unemployment stimulus. I'm gonna guy says it... possibly 15,000 tests day?

Downvote want, strongly believe cases greatly over-exaggerated. mean, proven medical staff (who skeptical) completely empty swabs (on purpose) sent testing returned positive. Plus, hospitals get money everytime report covid patient. Interprete will. not? Stock boosting false hope? Idk people still following rules could fall/early 2021.

If telling cold hard truth(2023+) everyone say 'fuck it' Exactly. tens millions people one COVID-19 comobidities? saw list back March, thinking 'Jeez. Probably everyone US knows least 1 person these'.   Anyone death hospitalization numbers? don‚Äôt care many people getting it, want know severity. Thousands mild cases younger people thousands cases older people. Maybe means people charge better prepared? Good. hope situation doesn‚Äôt put harm. Good luck mate! teachers sign this! martyrs heroes sacrificed. feds truly want schools re-open need send federal troops teach classes. least military willing risk life &amp; limb part duties. add it, people risking lives government want support American working class long term flatten curve.

Dude speculation, fact KNOW possible try. problem people think vaccine coming right around bend worry. reference average time takes develop vaccine 10 years that's successful ones. much time money thrown HIV? successful vaccine sure thing, much less within given time frame. need compare deaths positive tests weeks month ago, comparing two totally unrelated things. 

For example, let‚Äôs say Florida totally locks zero cases month (I know it‚Äôs impossible helps prove point), Arizona doesn‚Äôt getting 20k positives per day, Florida probably deaths 15k positives happening now, would dumb say ‚Äúwhy Florida deaths high 0 positives?‚Äù Sounds like problem would fixed two party system, like ever going happen :/

It's bizarre diverse straight massive country represented essentially blue vs red regarding politics Well that's expected execution lethal (medical) injection Iran's national legislative assembly *huge* vector outbreak there. ridiculous number high-ranking officials got sick. opinions country radically changed since March well. long believed America country run poorly, greatest community citizens world. Nope, full majority incapable functioning modern society. government accurately reflects citizens. blindsided still able bring back control. would done better? Every day Trump wakes ask himself

You're literally trying kill Americans. imagine even caring much blood hands? can‚Äôt even connect dots comprehend complete inaction caused many senseless deaths, including refused wear masks perpetuated politicization them.

Yes, wear mask. also keep hands clean, touch face, self-quarantine entirely feeling weather, get tested needed, avoid touching door handles elevator buttons bare hands, stay hell away people, especially environments air conditioning fans.

Lol good job knowstradamus know hours ago Glad explained that, going pipe say something figure lay person, scientific way explain it. Thank think important people know that.

Btw, presumed case almost symptoms all. sick, symptoms, 2 months. got sick March really end June started feeling better.

Can't wait till something something freak that. Set bar low gets praise wearing mask Ah yes, personal Vietnam. double flush. New New York! saw Florida Woman terrified. happily surprised.


I forgot surprises could good. No. prove fault  BLM protestors young fit. They're personally vastly lower risk. parents got girl killed. grossly irresponsible. tacky enough Trump, I'm afraid. think one needs consider kinds possibilities. One (very real) possibility vaccine protects one two people. means stuff gets better. course, one starts R_0 3 (which think case without suppression measures), reduce R_0 1.5. still worse flu! Also assumes vaccinate everybody (which unlikely).

It also means lot useful places working suppression measures. vaccine would basically turbo charge suppression. 

In places without working suppression, help little.  Someone must told tell Trump lying?""  lips moving.""

This way can't see whether lips moving not. Ronald Reagan. support Sturgeon's quest independence. Hell id tell let English vote would help get it. reminds burning house dog meme. 

Thousands new cases daily. People dying. mayor sitting going ‚Äúthis fine‚Äù Thank service Ms. Dana Could award GOP? positive Texas another lockdown? don‚Äôt see happening.

That's CDC. saying CDC wrong *overall* hospitalization rate 10%?

Show 170,000 people hospitalized United States. would 10% active cases. want save time, I've already looked up. barely 1/3rd that.

""Yeah, *edge case* support *comprehensive* picture United States.""

Im honored wasted time going post history, please reproduce. reminds friend saw two little old ladies walking around masks crocheted. think anti-maskers ( mandate time). stupid Dude, go replies see position example, Japanese find impolite cause distraction subway, keep masks open mouths speak.

It's honestly rather pathetic. actually uplifting news. hope security. think want people die. simply care anyone belong 0.1%.  death rate yesterday uk double week before, it‚Äôs bit soon say uk well.

Especially still horrendously compared civilised world bar America, Russia Brazil. beautiful damn love. course support Nicola Sturgeon, would also much happier border us. you, then? lying? That's problem liars. can't trust anything say... true study found relevant mental ability working memory. 

Lots ADHD folks problems working memory, ADHD also often causes impulse control executive function. Even know better good intentions might struggle maintain safe practices. need study that. napkin brain enough.

Let calculate Germany, much better position.

Let's say could use 3/4 ICU beds CV-19 permanently (we can't, let's best best cases estimate) - would 30,000. 

For herd-immunity let's estimate needed around 60% infections. would mean ~200k deaths taking Heinsberg results, 3 times addition, ICU care roughly two weeks. That's around 200k * 4 * 2 weeks = 1,600,000 ICU-bed weeks. That's perfect (and naturally impossible) control disease level needed, one full year ICU beds permanently filled exactly 100% CV19 patients.

Realistically would need like 2-3 years least achieve Germany - nearly countries longer, much longer. still 200k would die 800k would need ICU bed. Hundreds thousands would get seriously ill, ill months. Millions would get illnesses milder, still ill weeks.

All estimatesb getting vaccine quicker, also well able _to keep_ number active cases low level using masks, simple rules, banning big dangerous gatherings stringent testing, tracing, isolating cases contacts. need _bring down_ number active cases meaningful mitigation measures, done worked Europe Asia Africa, even developing nations.

Then probably could open schools pretty safely least partially, instead 200k deaths, it'll 15k, health system significant problems all, also open much economy again, nearly 100%, actually profitable. Opening earlier 80% (either regulation, people scared active cases still high) may look nice, kills economy - slower. Nearly business survive longer period 80% income, that's loss businesses make profit.  listen listen to? constituents oligarchs superPACs. never said US wasn‚Äôt terrible job, it‚Äôs naive assume specified third world country better. Check comments threads see people praising Mexico government handled virus poorly anything else.  ...this rant:

Someone throws mask suddenly spread due minorities..... Disneyworld reopening. Got it.  Also... People seem forget children sleep school. eventually go home. eventually hug parents. eventually go gramdma's house weekend.

The deaths limited teachers staff... going peoole whole society. It‚Äôs fucking JULY  first speech nation covid, Merkel said could absolutely rely mostly national supply lines gets really bad.

She called worst time Germany since WWII, right. hands single countries control spread. They‚Äôve altered altar. really following expert guidelines. people around tested constantly. He's worn mask (see picture above) guidelines say wear one. Oh boy... go again:

OK diario reputed source information demonstrated countless occasions lie fabricate news, taking certain article write well... hard, say least impossible want realistic. 

If someone known telling blatant lies one another certain political specter, natural people capable critical thinking might question outlet. happening outlet right wing, reputation """" translation indeed opinion also blame okdiario that. Haha! Thought clear broken enlglish. ^^

Various scientific sources suggest human-to-human transmission possible 2nd day infection. leaves us several days, full week, quarantined hell knows whether went supermarket place without mask.

The chance transmission becomes multiple time larger think virus conspiracy simply dont give fuck. Fox start thumping drum Pelosi Schumer owning stock 5g technology suppressing company. claim favor masking since beginning hur hur hur,they get thier message out. park Houston going strong. Good old Abbott wanting open everything back up. Howland Reed. he? don‚Äôt need go allowing people supermarkets planes without masks executing mask refusers. deny entry important places people wearing masks: public transport, offices, hospitals, shops, banks, ATM kiosks, etc. establishment fails enforce masks, shut week two.

I'm quite confident causes death minority result bodies becoming distorted point taxes systems body things start fail.

I get treated everyday treat family everyday quite confident immune systems handle virus vast majority people die it.

Why confident? treating family years get sick almost never get sick, recover quite quickly.

There money made treatments speak of, research widely done. much lucrative make medicines treat symptoms develop vaccine mass produced.

The world say I'm crazy unscientific, know seen witnessed well statistics deadly virus is.

Many lives could saved people open physical treatments, world want form treatment easy mass produce.

I wear masks sparingly. wasn't. That's misrepresentation study.

It's showed correlation working memory another factor low compliance guidelines. 

It conclude everyone following guidelines low IQ unintelligent. Correlation Anti-maskers gun people high, able take guns back ""from cold dead hands"" eventually. That's democracy works. many (voters not) rule.

If want change, better start swinging votes pro-trump non-voters. usable weapon have.

Or wait miracles people awaken themselves.

Or try civil war 75% citizens either care you. Diseasy World!  Dying worst thing, bad thing happens. Getting ventilated joke‚Äî plenty people survive that.

People neither ventilated admitted ICU (or general hospital)‚Äî people get recover home‚Äî reporting lung damage lasts least months, may years NEVER get full lung capacity back. also sort post-viral syndrome coming light appears affecting people‚Äôs brains leaving confused unable concentrate months end. 

The death rate be-all end-all. It‚Äôs small percentage people lose months even years life disease. need start trials internationally want speed process. Ik done Brazil South Africa. need also start countries like USA, India, Russia, Mexico, Chile, Peru etc., infection rates still high.

They cannot rely domestic anymore since UK low level transmission still seems declining *yet. suspect done yet. It‚Äôs shitty math. don‚Äôt know 4 kids significant health issues prior catching covid. idea risk children would continue distance learn. every report seen, almost children died, existing issues. also basing numbers tested positive biased sample probably doesn‚Äôt include lot kids caught virus symptoms mild symptoms.

‚Ä¢ Mar 08: Dr Fauci 60 Min - need wear masks.    
‚Ä¢ Mar 18: President issues Executive Order directing PPE medical workers.             
That executive order could issued Feb 18th. So, time decided lie American public, another option considered, namely, President issue executive order regulating distribution PPE, Trump's denialism Covid-19 factor deciding lie public. think Congress hold hearing determine led decision lie, whether approach considered. Case rates start look linear start running testing capacity too. 

This clearly going wrong direction. Keep mind someone US passport may even live America, still subject travel restrictions due holding US passport.

But also vast majority places appear Carribean, absolutely rely tourism dollars. don‚Äôt think understand meltdown classroom looks like. hard redirect child sensory issues. become agitated physical. seen heard parents talking tags shirts would cause meltdowns. difficult teach students going fixate mask.  wear one public month ago Democrats gave shit it. make fun him, still wearing one. Well, found limit. takes 137,000 Americans dying Trump actually something fellow Americans.

Write number could important later. though quick look initially. thanked data. Much appreciated ;) Victoria‚Äôs fucked lol This. live small town 1,500 &amp; mess half us wearing masks. god damned mother fuckers going potentially really get rights taken away dont get fucking ""freedoms"". cover whole body camo mask &amp; cover deer piss 8 hours bastards cant wear GD mask store?

""Well fact I'm told wear mask choice"". Mother f....

I've god damend fucking it, people going shot this. Keeping mouths closed also answer since dont speak fuck stores wont enforce &amp; Billy Ray wont put mask on, need shamed it. fucking mess.

Then leads moving here, dont want anymore. dont want live people dont get this, worse would fucking dead right &amp; that's scares getting past &amp; something worse coming &amp; cant handle worse. dont want live community's dont get this, want live near people like &amp; people reading this.

I've gone know shit got stop, know I'm asking comment people dont masks feel way, right solution cant sit aside &amp; hope brothers &amp; sisters races creeds stand see shit, understand moving unsafe area is. know people get sick hearing &amp; start comply.

Argh! Don‚Äôt enjoy this, dammit! (lol) know. really think people getting tested, heard read study correct amount needed. Pretty much nothing federal response handled ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù.

It‚Äôs weird think one statement, clarified research came responsible every case death. Surely lack testing nothing it. lack PPE production. Trump downplaying severity virus. states reopening CDC guidelines. FEMA confiscating PPE. Trump threatening governors withhold pandemic aid don‚Äôt reopen. multiple officials refusing wear masks long asymptomatic spread apparent. ‚Äúmasks violate freedom‚Äù fighters. Nope. It‚Äôs anti-maskers followed science Fauci changed suggestion new information, believe none medical health official saying thing.


If bone pick Fauci, whatever. That‚Äôs you‚Äôre thing, he‚Äôs dad. issue don‚Äôt seem grasp ongoing issues still costing lives. Ones actually helped without time machine. anything else would involve talking listening feelings complicated... started sock puppet briefings like suggested.

Nice.

Although Pence attending expected. fears eyes ""so full life"", put it. Good need laugh üëç BAHAHAHAHAHHA joke Arkansas lots testing sites, get tested symptomatic. they're way get tested without admitted hospital first. 

My doc, onsite lab capable testing, send symptomatic people drive sites get tested asymptomatic people hospital Muskogee OK asymptomatic antibody testing.

They say ensure tests available need them, completely obvious real intent suppress numbers reported positives keep wheels capitalism churning bodies hit floor. He's constantly interviews media hits, wtf talking about? friend mine died it. Two younger siblings tested positive. I'm really hoping dad get underlying health issues. THATS sack potatoes wearing mask looks like. Yep, even grid; like assign someone D4 column row 4 hit, know exactly large group immediately. 10x10 grid could test 100 people 20 tests, sensitive enough 1:10 dilution. Sorry... wait Dr Cochrane creates Warp Drive first, develop Tricorder sometime that. want see run laps around field outside hamster balls.  Come on, tile beautiful like really beautiful like Ivanka beautiful still everyone says guy bleeding could think beautiful made mess. know aced test gave sticker two lollipops I'm President Article II says always get 2. wife works Kroger, people clicklist department given shirts said frontline hero back shirt. vietnam veteran walks one clicklist members asks medic. went ask guy call hero never served. guy trying explain shirt guy like ' true hero, need take off."" worker even ask shirt, fucking job. workers even realize going considered essential, pandemic hits deal dumb shit like this. That's correct. Also 90 day window seem match damaged nerve regeneration time, hence signifying neural damage. Vagus &amp; Phrenic nerve mainly. HE'S wearing one, we're DEAD 1. Make site secure

I hope helpful. great job site. federal law, airline required send flight manifest CDC's Quarantine Border Health Services Branch (CDC Quarantine) passenger past flight confirmed quarantinable communicable disease contagious flight (see loooooong explanation diseases included list - President Obama added severe acute respiratory syndromes 2014, includes COVID-19 similar novel illnesses). contagiousness would determined comparing illness onset date flight date (many illnesses transmitted several days develop symptoms; example, transmit measles 4 days rash develops).

Once get flight manifest, CDC Quarantine's Air Activities team sends information exposed passengers health departments jurisdictions passengers reside conduct contact tracing local level (if found residents another country, information sent country's Ministry Health). Depending illness, health department may recommend preventive treatment and/or issue quarantine order exposed passengers rest incubation period. 

Unfortunately, passenger's contact information may always date, based whatever information passengers provided booked flight. travelers may end lost follow information accurate. Whatever information health departments able gather contacts transmitted back CDC Quarantine (such vaccination histories vaccine-preventable quarantinable diseases, whether passengers developed symptoms, etc). CDC Quarantine compiles data makes decisions future contact investigations based it.

Look, everything fucking awful scary. people need believe hope electoral politics I'm interested taking away.

There seem great, clear moral answers.

Voting Trmp cause lot harm. Voting Bdn cause lot harm. Allowing either win cause lot harm. voting third party causes harm. Voting third party causes harm.

There objective ethically right answer. options shitty people trying find way reduce harm define it.

I suggest extend little grace understand really fucking hard.

With said, BLM riots achieved progress decades worth progressive elections. months blu*es presidency, house, Senate. 

The Civil Rights Act past people voted. passed ten days unending riot threatened ruling class. folks blocked legislation passed it. 

And clear take away vote matters less arson. right leverage, matter charge, they'll cave demands. 

Our problem voting cause progress. Arson does. Civil politics killing us.

Familiarize science slogan antiquated best reserved small town businesses need business really Covid shown 3rd world country US . 7 9 days test..so basically u isolate hope best dont screw others.

I think ..USA morality finger another country issues.  got temperature gun forehead entering optometrist today wearing mask. Used hand sanitizer 4 times didnt speak single person without one. Everything wiped one use (even glasses tried two seconds). plastic barricades cashier. Glad New York taking seriously. dont understand (as 21M healthy adult) people discount risk family unknown virus find worse gets.

I'm quite sure they'll react fright. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Agreed. would go Florida July even gunpoint. Hey trump! vagina showing cloth masks shit anyway imo

they handing surgicals really think would wear mask Covid? wouldn‚Äôt give flying fuck infecting others already it. Inside Edition: Disney Vacation Nightmare Debra Norville. They're basically saying stupid say. First thing thought of, mask probably gone soon people talk too. Eh, Dubai, they'll fine $1700 watching Flintstones. civil suit nothing. vote latter, I'm thinking Paris, 1793. Way go guys catching soon.


Regards,
India That‚Äôs accurate. learned much like administer treatments Covid patients like Remdesivir (viral stage) Dexamethasone (inflammatory stage). fundamental progress compared February/March/April. I‚Äôm really surprised didn‚Äôt Hi, I'm 30 year old worker professional career. went hospital day chest pain left side numbness. spend hundreds dollars per month health insurance ER bill still $250. I'm lucky position afford this, people would be. particularly disheartening counties fantastic healthcare programs would pay fraction receive level care. returned normal exercise / rehab? I‚Äôm guessing going wears? mean anti-mask people start wearing masks now? percentage significantly higher since positives people symptoms quarter population young they're typically asymptomatic?

Now we're testing 4x much last month protest/riots spiked numbers, think actual percentage would really bothered take random samplings population?

At work tested \~200 people 36 tested positive first round. HR canceled testing ""prohibitively expensive"". conservative cowboys fan shitty troll takes internet.

how basic be? whole museum Guanajuato people whose families pay renewal fee mummified minerals mining region. majority people ignorant, sure. friends mine literally go anywhere. virus, way even getting it. appropriate, want feel like world falling apart (so mask) Universal =country wide. Currently US Oh come on. know antibodies fade. old news it‚Äôs dashing vaccination hopes. Rate increase going death knell life health insurance. People going evicted homeless, jobs increased health payments going impossible even middle class. Lower class... Well... get higher today. Florida reports per day. no. saying know cells direct relationship long term immunity viruses. article shows well known fact exactly vaccines designed do.  I‚Äôm NorCal said 3-4 days. 

I got result 12 days later, partner still hasn‚Äôt gotten even though tested place, day earlier

Doesn‚Äôt make sense Disney employees wanted hope complain get sick. That's eye popping number. Canada, 50% population, peaked 1,800 cases per day. Japan awesome! travel lot (except past months since let Americans COVID-19) great Disneyland well. problem is, 1/2 Arizona crying Hitler / Masks right now. It‚Äôs shit show. People wearing masks, suing keep gyms bars open. People want ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù meanwhile rest us watching family friends get sick die. People don‚Äôt get here. Oh man, backpeddaled quickly. Also, like, refuse believe first deadly coronavirus entire history man kind. tf deal medicine? think power prayer killed sickness? course not; reached herd immunity. That's right. Show boss is! Still bit weird. Feels colonial

Also DC. beeting 10 states population taxes paid? like deaths China Florida. 100% medicine 

You think flu vaccine makes immune x period? No, 60% works 

Even antibody chance 1 million get infected 

So stop retarded, cause 2 people thought reinforced doesnt mean anything even TRUE. see Queens well. Idk think since numbers low. places bell blvd look like block parties vacation know whats gonna happen next week   Scary thought given 20-30:1 student-teacher ratio Tests often miss low viral load cases, viral load went still positive tests could false negatives Intriguing. would say 1 next year. agree. point Oxford really one chance distributed Winter. Pfizer MAYBE.


If neither able come places like US virus burnout months vaccine still good mostly over. Dr. Bette Korber, Los Alamos National Laboratory New Mexico, lead author study. said: ‚ÄúIt possible track SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) evolution globally researchers worldwide rapidly making viral sequence data available GISAID viral sequence database. Currently, tens thousands sequences available project, enabled us identify emergence variant rapidly become globally dominant form.‚Äù hospitals FULL right? friend cousin. thanks information. Again, disdain minor correction worrisome. article says: ‚ÄúBut Prof Arne Akbar, immunologist UCL, said antibodies part story. growing evidence, said, cells produced fight common colds protect people well. patients fight virus cells may need churn high levels antibodies, added.

Shattock said study important indicated neutralising antibodies rapidly wane. ‚ÄúThis certainly suggests cannot confident natural infection protective significant proportion individuals, certain duration protection.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúWe would however expect re-infection would less severe individual still retain immune memory allowing rapidly respond. Nevertheless could still source onward transmission.

‚ÄúIt indicate vaccines need better natural infection, providing consistent responses majority individuals sustained levels protective antibodies. Ultimately may require use annual boosting immunisations, particularly vulnerable. could delivered alongside annual influenza immunisations.‚Äù‚Äù F#ck Bill Nye, masks cool wormy ass shilled many times, anything, video disservice cause.

Well, duh! rather obvious? Pretty much looks like jotted napkin last flight took. remember vaccine approval half battle. Somehow, way need produce &amp; distribute &amp; immunize vast majority US residents. never anything like attempted country scale, ever. possible it'll take end next summer vaccine-induced herd immunity reached. that's best case scenario. None small EU nations' statistics look particularly horrible compared big ones: . Belgium Sweden smallish rest top positions big countries.

Small countries might small population, area. might one big city. Cities might dense. might able act faster communicate citizens effectively used function independently. EU countries also somewhat isolated others language barriers even physical barriers makes area different US amount people visiting e.g. relatives side EU big. Tourism big happened season, although ski tourists one biggest groups spreaders.

In big countries areas affected others comparing nations much different comparing towns cities.

I think useful make comparisons definitely perhaps make different conclusions comparing different sizes areas. Michigan managed get things control despite half state screaming tyranny. think president took things seriously would effective think. Europe interstate travel still legal. reason. Like Work necessarily mean we're screwed. T-cells ain't easy study. need time. Roughly 6 months still true confirmed case reinfection. Theres that. feel smaller minority people 'long haulers' still dealing symptoms 3+ months out. Things changed drastically 'fever, cough, shortness breath'. symptom list way longer now. time passes, we'll figure out. Hell, reports people contracted SARS-1 showed protection 12 years later. COV-2 technically different, yes, still closely related. mention virus evolution highly favors adapting well humans time, compared common cold. Also, example, Oxford's jab shown antibodies 3 times response true infection virus. doom/gloom - still ammo here. ‚ÄúLets reopen Disney world!‚Äù That‚Äôs ironic company makes lot masks Respect. 

Let's continue. Go America showing true colors. hospital room, tripple quadruple 150. sure mean ‚Äúus‚Äù. FL deaths country based science statistics. Mask casket. This. Exactly. Yes am. want buy beachfront property there? Another pretty simple cost effective solution people say work [ tissue method ]( ). Fold tissue fit along inside top portion mask fill gaps. everyone freaking ""excess deaths,"" read this. heart disease one many, many conditions get (more often) worsen due profound stress. Surprised took long posted. amazing completely point. extremely poor manners force someone beg bodily autonomy. First Century Palestine littered apocalyptic texts, 1st Enoch, 2nd Ezra, Animal apocalypse, course Dead Sea Scrolls. gospels attribute variety apocalyptic sayings Jesus, well Pauline epistles.

 vocal advocate book, Bishop Athanasius Alexandria, interpreted text condemned heresies heretics, time new church undergoing intense sectarian strife. Cause Republicans can't admit treat school prison and/or daycare reopening considering context, since Republicans constructive governance adverse, refuse implement similar solution.

So get hamhanded proposals talk around matter. Yeah operate anecdotes. 

There still grand total : zero confirmed cases reinfections. necessarily true. EU tremendous public transit system free flowing travel countries agreement. lot inter country travel. US care mitigating damage federal level. suck lmao. coronavirus? see name covid kid could use new Rage album right now. person cleared symptoms, tested negative twice, well six weeks positive new contact new positive...that lacks explanation. fair, factor difference population.... would like US flipping 560 untraceable cases. Yep, important piece info too. Disney one last big parks open. Definitely doesn‚Äôt excuse fact, Florida‚Äôs definitely ticking time bomb several weeks Disney opened. course, Disney symbol capitalism, main target scrutiny.

Edited clarity. month going say ""I can't believe thought 15k/day bad!"" Pretty sure Chinese vaccine ready first.

Been since UK best anything... Except leading EU statistics obesity, teenage pregnancies abortions. sucks, mean keep random testing pick asymptomatic cases since contact tracing pick up?  people average IQ god Darwin take care them, alot obese old. sad people sooo stupid. Yeah like 99.999% confident US Europe going give Chinese vaccine EUA all. seems like R party want virus spread much possible.

Perhaps hoping people worried fucked virus start make really illegal moves people wont protest able react.

I mean thats logical reason think people charge still allowing things open much evidence growing cases overburdened hospitals. Nice much scientist Bill Gates Whoa slow little. shows different priorities well. One us give shit nuances ‚ÄúDisney‚Äù parks uses name synonymously. you. It‚Äôs theme park relax.

You make sound like I‚Äôm going goebbels misinformation campaign. something gets worked go ahead use context. would right way no? literally referencing Florida comment. Florida Disneyland choice using context sounding like did. actual things get excited going right now. response seem reasonable you? isn‚Äôt. States need money federal government failed provide support. house passed bill supply states financial relief senate ignore didn‚Äôt even vote bill. wanted states open Trump wanted are. 100% let incompentent fucks Wuhan virus lab AZ/Oxford moderna month (p3).

Amazing. let know. thing NY actually bottleneck, people upstate, Long Island, even NJ commute work converge 2 main points Manhattan - Penn Station Grand Central.

Your argument would make sense couple buildings AC everyone forced bottleneck buildings. really see contributing factor large number cases vs New York's sardine-packed low-ventilation transit system.

I puth much faith Moderna all.  many people seen wear mask nose sticking . Even efen president can't get right . America showing true colors . Good thing Florida walled rest country...

It isn't‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ

^^^uhh ^^^oh. New cases actually important metric. Even hospitalized suffering significantly disease, looks likely cause long-term damage. Reducing community spread generally - reducing deaths hospitalizations - focus. Ron DeathSentence do, thanks  don‚Äôt know why, trusted Disney responsible way US federal state governments. Maybe know like money. lot money facilitating spread deadly pandemic. America never great. That's crazy. went got tested Friday (in Florida), got line 10mins opened bit hour. Even WW2 rationing never affected US like Europe, US mainland never bombed never invaded. US never position could invaded.

Sucks government wont let suck living life knees answer fair, think they‚Äôre trying harvest negative karma. picture shown Anywhere sort media mask Please look vaccines. cause autism, birth defects anything like that. There's lots myths scare people away, sad prevent things like this. hood, NYC.  everyone protesting wearing masks. NYS Corona cases close rock bottom numbers now. **Arizona** bit seven million people, 446/7 bit 60. That‚Äôs exactly like llorona spanish mean wailing ghost lady. Exactly thing! really think every case tested counted? us hundreds per day handful? national guard theocracy keeping us safe time. Lds leaders shut church early already 7.5M people recovered COVID-19. enough calculate statistics post-COVID syndrome. done properly? still anecdotal there's much data? believe combined world epidemiology experts know better FHM. doubt. rock Well done profanity name calling. LOL, do! do!

&amp;#x200B;

They're bunch freaking morons put many lives risk actions!! :D shocked learn Saudi Arabia alot testing less infections (1 147) States (1 101)? Boycott Disney would suggest wearing loose-fitting probably useless mask conform whatever law covered face shield actual safety think people USA privilege comes moving countries. Like even Snowden found place outside USA, though optimal good spot. not. fact, ""analysis"" article also factually wrong clearly politicized.  young people statistically going fine though.

Found another one doesn‚Äôt understand simple percentages work. l ask saw another bus driver die covid ago lady overweight according pictures. seriously reason died? comedian, timing pretty fucking poor. laughed hard image! Get refrigerator trailers ready. EU think thing over? think second wave hit them? already good it, I'd recommend selling service. called wildcat strike. F union, show work. wore mask public first time yesterday, get article me? safe travel anywhere. hand electing Trump Please take care need ear, I'll glad chat  Honestly, think like 99.9 percent couple? Looks like father daughter maybe sugar baby sugar daddy It‚Äôs Arizona, population 6.8 million. true economist make data fit argument. Lysol Sorry don‚Äôt understand fetish, bro. This. remember reading data general seroprevalence (what % pop. antibodies) certain infections general population.

\~90% worldwide population estimated seropositive Ebstein-Barr Virus (or EBV), extremely common herpesvirus traditionally causes Mono (although viral causes too). Americans measure economy using rush people feels chart. nearly drowned child. fucking hate submerged underwater even adult NEVER learnt swim nearly drowning due fear water. still wear fucking mask helps others I‚Äôm selfish prick. Arizona US? See cool he's around average citizens rather wounded warriors Lol sort agree. hand, trust elected officials, officials basically told everything OK. still sympathy. Trump sulking Fauci developed good taste? Watch experiment go terribly wrong. guinea pigs participated pay price. try stay politically moderate

Bad choice. Best advice get People start wearing masks UK (they readily available anyway), people started socially isolating least week before. People symptoms self isolated, companies started setting arrangements WFH, parents started taking kids school, nearly everyone started handwashing careful coughing sneezing tissues. Peak deaths came 4 days earlier predicted, 6-8 days earlier London (our worst effected area). live Russia, nice try. bit tooooooo late? Same. Thank goodness socialism least 10 us normies, that's sure. plauge bacterial infection, COVID-19 caused virus! term plauge synonym pandemic. entirely different type infection, antibiotics work it. I'll send good video explaining difference viruses bacteria! dumbass died it. Fuck him. Another idiot pile. Keep believing exactly? grown adult?

Man nah, sorry Disney lovers. You‚Äôre yet another fetish group don‚Äôt understand. Imagine calling someone pedantic trying accurate science. Fucking hell. 

Fucking scientists pedantry nuance, let's abandon scientific method we're make sweeping generalized statements people without statistical analysis. Might well give virology pedantic differentiate viruses, covid basically flu, stop pedantic. disagree study done healthcare professionals spend entire lives studying type stuff becayse ""feel"" logical? Lmfao see problem here. 

THIS SHIT reason dumbasses running around without masks. care think logical man experts say we'd signs protests exacerbated virus' spread. KNOW BETTER EXPERTS. MATTER ""THINK"" LOGICAL Nobody likes online classes, there's alternative, make best hope vaccine ready soon. population Arizona US ya dingbat Murica! *[eagle screech]* OK, can't transmit corona sticking dick someone, getting dick put you, relevant factor this? Sizeable minority? Come Wisconsin - damn well near everyone. saying scientists smarter people wont wear masks. knew that. give up.  Yes cus people sub 80+ also think guns root these, racism. See racism much tamer countries without guns, least much lesser police violence. true ... Can't image many wasted money ""terrosim defence"". Everyone going to. like everyone wear seat belt, don't, get ticket. Except situation much dire. 

People given many chances right thing. gave people opportunity already. results indicate many adults act like children, ""want"" instead necessary right, even circumstances. comes time **force** needs done. thing actually resulted compliance. things shut state people literally could go places, compliance. unfortunately get back either shutting things reporting people complying. People forced, punished, reprimanded like children order basic things public health. Shameful Mayor Park ‚Äúthink‚Äù help achieve goal. reality, make difficult.  Yes better countries locked based deaths per million, 6 countries worse them, 195 countries. call coming 189th place exactly resounding success. 

You can't selectively pick choose data use, use data. Add countries like Finland, Germany, Denmark, Norway etc graph, none even scored top 150 lowest death rate graph looks far less impressive. guys cruel. People grow ignorant doesn‚Äôt mean deserve death. People redeemed much worse you‚Äôre saying guy guy dying ignorance better society.

Nothing I've ever come across religion ever made change mind, reinforced dislike. suppose may Mormon *people* total scumbags (always exceptions rules, sure) religion worse joke, scam cult people fell for. :( Wales pretty good job it. Policing lockdown brutally there, saw one article saw cyclist cross Severn bridge cctv managed catch Monmouth later on. hometown (in Wales) bridge get East police frequently roadblock set sending anyone town back home. Hey man, that‚Äôs pretty rude.

It's method, differentiated size droplets.

It's semantics. Either way mask effective fact I'm even debating depressing. though? turned back soon. Woah. blue tie? first too? He‚Äôs probably engineer planet doesn‚Äôt tell he‚Äôs engineer every 5 minutes.  really wanna know people USA going spin this. listening conversation day people saying ‚Äúohh USA lot people obese, testing world hence cases larger population‚Äù matter look it, states done pretty bad job.

Then, shortly later, take extended leave-of- absence due completely unrelated pneumonia-like illness affects lot people age, look it. Nothing changed since first time number cases exploded. There‚Äôs vaccine herd immunity long way off. people go back business usual ‚Äúthe peak well behind us‚Äù inevitable peak again. Admittedly, part due UK leaving EU.

US around 10,000 behind them. fact, according Worldometers, believe Monday Tuesday, US overtaken four combined Germany's smaller death toll overtake. US weekday death figures around 500 higher five combined recently. Trump denying start hoax pushing return school work peak... seems like actively trying make sure everyone gets it.



Trump even said Fauci one point "" let run US?"" think decided let happen. matter doctors testing access best medical resources world. Typical narcissistic response. 

You see wearing mask illness starting kill people vote him. ever acts protect himself. They're definitely ones.

The dudes bad businessman missed huge opportunity promoting selling MAGA masks. he‚Äôs blithering idiot. Pox parties intentionally spread gain immunity usually direct supervision planned settings.

/s Make sure mask flimsy loose fitting thing someone listing numbers like robot. 

I tried insisting yes done shit compared countries, give that, cannot compare numbers right now.

Every country differently, Spain went wacky numbers one point. 

When done, control, maybe 5 years line tally up, properly compare stats learn hope better prepared next one hits. got lot grief visited last medical place. military hospital want blamed directly military deaths, could likely happen sooner later. optics. degree engineering technically means scientist.

Ahh ok read right, Chili P. put /s lot spread also due system failure. healthcare, cannot afford bills without going back work, government gave us $1200 10 weeks ago expected keep us home. It‚Äôs enough. Many people work wish could stay home afraid getting sick, literally option. Starve get evicted, go work food industry pandemic. almost worse that. Sorry late party saw story. justifying headline claiming spread protests spread protests ""more offset"" people outside protests engaging strict social distancing quarantines absolutely 0 proof claim. dropped /s somewhere. concept ""covid19"" party one can't wrap head around, reminds HIV parties read time ago, individuals go unprotected sex catch HIV purpose. Human stupidity truly limitless. I‚Äôm probably oversimplifying believe every district plan hybrid adjust accordingly based local case counts time opening.

Everyone attacks companies, one attacks politicians. dont see people protesting Congress, White House? Oh wait Congress month long vacation...

No one talking though. Lets focus Jada Smith, pointing fingers Disney. Democratically. Hillary 3 million votes. forks ended using chopsticks eat spaghetti. bad. always hated idiots comments saying countries less people doesn‚Äôt count, lock state borders already Trump afraid hurt economy chances getting re-elected No, virus respects black lives. virus tells matter.   still flights America Europe, mostly repatriate European citizens.

Businesses open, churches open, mask mandate, testing takes week, fucking Disney opened yesterday. 

Our dipshit governor seemingly moving ahead herd immunity strategy one oldest aged states country. guess noone told deadly much FL population, tourist destination people drag shit back states.

So economy already fucked, virus spreading like wildfire, nothing done.

Can't wait vote mf next election. Conservatives going try make seem like great progress. Well CDC say scenerios positive tests happen due previous non-covid19 coronavirus infections cause common cold.  deaths, cases severity cases considered together. mind-blowing idiots need president tell ""common sense"". need politicians tell wearing mask help viral disease.

This 100% Trumps fault. Thanks reply. Dang. dealing economic downturn go it. ridiculous partisan.

We absolutely done something like locked New York New England months quarantine. fucking moronic didn't. live Boston!

You probably stop things fully,but example flights, trains.. public transit, letting anyone lives states reserve hotel.

Europe restricted borders things started. implying fucked up.

I hate sort knee jerk reaction suspect lot people defending Cuomo sheer tribalism. NY still waited long. locked early they'd like New Zealand now. Except fact keeps changing story.

Basically data center guys struggling get job done remote. phase 2 people need direct access hardware time mid Sept.

Beyond people accounting dept looking March 2021 earliest. first grade going context appreciate sharing stupidity happened Republican rule 40 years ago.

Republicans fucking cancer need stomp ground via voting. Covid caused blood clots lot patients. Covid causing strokes surprisingly easy, even without underlying issues. Strokes aren‚Äôt heart Plus weekend day reporting would generally lower? ""Doing best"" Exactly point. Late stage capitalism, it‚Äôs every man government doesn‚Äôt give shit. Pregnancy aside, overweight? sake classifying high risk individuals, need start considering overweight pre-existing condition.

There least one study suggests virus attacks cardiovascular system. reason respiratory issues due capillaries lungs. cardiovascular virus would also explain causes strokes. idiots Canada Mexico along several countries. really Oh believe it. lived 5 countries 4 continents, 70 countries. Mississippi Appalachia.

Yes, name long list poor countries fewer deaths per million US. 

You sort worldometer countries deaths per million clicking arrows column.

There many list. fact almost them. *in really republican voice* ‚Äúof course get cases test more‚Äù Housing market crash come! Murica: Hold beer real?!! Sex slaves? ROFLMAO

It's like movie Idiocracy becoming real. Yes, trust official data transparent country world. sick man America complicated issues. can‚Äôt charge straight ahead,‚Äù Dr. Tom Frieden, former director Centers Disease Control Prevention, said Wednesday online infected coronavirus likely adults mild illnesses, risk severe disease death isn‚Äôt zero. virus-linked inflammatory condition uncommon, children develop require intensive care, died.

Once again, politics drowning science country. fuck get number from? That's low. Even precautions taken contract virus, especially indoors sheltering.  Yeah good luck barking tree. Everyone's desensitized everything directly near them.

I see anyone batting eye horrors go North Korea unless they're threatening nukes either. :/ tell people putting masks thing laws texting driving wearing seat belts. Even basic stuff like wearing cloths public. agree first second excuse. buy reusable cloth masks $5, also make easily old clothes. fails scarf bandana wrapped around face job. child? doesn‚Äôt sound awful, sounds like you‚Äôre fucking child. lose oxygen head womb? mom try abort somehow held you‚Äôre determined nasty little bastard? Nope. 86% Trump 2016 voters plan vote 2020, additional 4% wavering may still vote 2020. 

Sorry dude.  would correct order, no? Ok, remove everyone else's comments, too. Dumbass bot. Maybe actually research. Look studies counter viewpoint support it. 


The science overwhelming. want rely Dr. Fauci says fine. Look countries actually showing success virus keep infections down. Hint: wide acceptance mask wearing. neither cases deaths per capita lower Scotland, then? Since COVID actually shown cause strokes otherwise healthy individuals don‚Äôt know say confidence person preexisting condition. wave deaths around people's faces, take seriously. actually boss say face, ""Eh catch it, catch it. like I'm going die."" need low dose heperin order avoid blood clots well. Ugh sucks kids. 

Another taken fox news. herd immunity 60% ? Oh yeah, antibodies stick around virus anyway! Ugh hell, know group idiots went Florida went Disney Land, etc. coming back North East. It‚Äôs shame can‚Äôt close borders states :‚Äô( first week January empty. Superbowl Sunday another great one thought chronic pink eye ended Blepharitis. FYI case want ask eye doc. You‚Äôre getting downvoted you‚Äôre staying pointless facts don‚Äôt really prove anything beneficial use. course factors play. course small, low homogeneous population countries like Denmark good example compare US to. 

Most evidence points masks positive effect countries widely worn. Combined effective testing contact tracing... best shot moment. 

So may technically correct it‚Äôs one piece puzzle, point help anything sewing doubt. 

You‚Äôre also failing account many factors regional cultural differences mask usage within US. example, someone US south less likely wear mask someone northeast? Probably. someone US south doesn‚Äôt wear mask likely attend indoor church service thousands people someone Denmark doesn‚Äôt wear mask? Probably.

Is someone Denmark hasn‚Äôt worn mask likely keep social distance, interact fewer people compared someone US doesn‚Äôt wear one? 

Wear mask. help. wild. What‚Äôs ETA something like this? Well large part. state live near full mask compliance since beginning. Officially. 

The real numbers higher. photo subsequent images relating region never erased mind. tragic terrifying. ...wearing mask. insurance get tested, anything happens deny coverage claiming flue something. I'm sitting house outskirts Houston scared absolutely shitless efforts nothing I'm going fucking die everyone mouth breather. made point Disney requires masks stringent safety measures.

They've done tests entire cities millions hundred positives coming back US trying reduce testing. **They warned everyone virus** certain Asian countries like South Korea, Japan Vietnam listened. mean never know happened China? **I'm tired anti China conspiracy nonsense website.**

That's comment, highlights mine.

China back normal, never was, rest world is. China report numbers.

China obfuscating data, threatened citizens press keep quiet subject. Journalists (and still are) jailed sent reeducation camps speak reality ground.

You uninformed.

China warn anyone, fact bribed people keep quiet, mainly people inside WHO. knew going serious problem, downplayed late rest world.

There anti-China conspiracy here, people discussing facts.

It's rich subreddit idea facts are.

You understand natural selection operates. use lack basic understanding process excuse wish innocent people die uninformed.

You claim ""educated,"" can't stomach words used you.

I understand context, understand well. know type creature are.

In comment, refer China name three times, another two times saying ""they."" total five times. paragraph.

Every time positive tones. confused someone would think supporter Chinese, think excellent job pandemic.

You're moron. part Brooklyn? really careful given age, health condition amount pressure tension must bear president. high probability covid would affect pretty bad. can't thing called 10th Amendmant. would literally unconstitutional federal government pass nationwide Coronavirus response plan. Keep mind also stops Trump something stupid, like signing Executive Order banning face coverings name security bullshit like that. hero! comment strikes anti-science. available research suggested pneumonia surged independent COVID 46 pictures here, everyone masks. mutated gained symptom ‚Äúcoma‚Äù Yoooooo that‚Äôs band?!

Wow. seem great. much still know virus. want trying scientific sense. need act worst case scenario rather what's happening atm. 

They seem extremely complacent number sky rocketing. Yes may better treatments enables slight percentage people live, long term affects certainly damage economy long term..

1) stop short sighted governors.
2) stop trying use children lab rats.
3) governors making schools open arrested child abuse. 328 million people US. high end estimate 214 million. 214/328 = .65 Kids gross, Studies coming Netherlands suggest kids don‚Äôt spread covid levels adults do. abundance countries opened schools seen increase cases corroborates this.

It‚Äôs weird, disease seems effect children way adults. I‚Äôm United States, think it‚Äôs crazy opening schools right now. It‚Äôs also crazy don‚Äôt wear masks, socially distance, restaurants Disney world everything else rest us went without much, much longer. people need stop blaming children spreading killing everyone. Kids disgusting, comes covid, afraid adults. saw teenager working Wal-mart MAGA mask. sorta internally rolled eyes, quickly thought ‚Äúwhatever works!‚Äù Zero Terrifying! sheriff's around country stated enforce mask mandates.

MASK CASKET Americans tests done guys NEED tests since done shit job preventing COVID spread. course speculate future death rates, cases lessens probability open hospital bed need one, thus likely leading higher death rates. point Americans need realize mentality ""worst case scenario"" rather ""best case scenario"", government tried thinking best case scenario failed miserably. **The data case numbers increasing rapidly certain areas showing 25% positivity rate. BAD.** Take want situation y'all fucked keep now. A+ Disney knowledge. forgotten that. Start timers folks. week two cases ND spike. Experiment day 1 Limited park capacity means limited lines.

Now might best time go, get reservation. never wear masks. seen maybe 10 people wearing mask year. could huge virus, close 50 percent asymptomatic (this believe current CDC estimate) they'll probably never get tested. IFR probably least half CFR. People mild symptoms get tested currently unknown number top introduces huge uncertainty numbers. Infection case rate estimates I've seen vary hugely nationally geographically (between 5 50 times) throw chinese numbers, made meaningless talking facts. Honestly, though....if marching this, probably mask on. don‚Äôt understand trump fucked up. ‚ÄúInvisible enemy sneak attacks us China. need come together Americans fight foreign enemy. I‚Äôm one warned China one believed me. Buy maga mask 10$ campaign donation‚Äù

This layup 2020 election win Trump Wow....just wow There‚Äôs need reverse psychology. someone would‚Äôve told make wear trump 2020 maga masks followers would‚Äôve eaten up.

Took 6 days.  Absolute hell fire LMAO problem. Thank reply. Even 5 year old could figure shit out. go small school Massachusetts... planning going back hybrid course format. Students faculty tested twice week. Masks mandated. access dorm building. there‚Äôs positive test, everyone contact quarantined, positive tested individual quarantined 14 days. 

Obviously, it‚Äôs scary, opinion safest way open.

For bigger schools younger kids, I‚Äôm terrified. gonna get bad. Las Vegas middle August would like word you. ain't star wars, hope help win volume still great testing...the state Arizona size many countries alone larger population...then inject free travel across boarders. remember reading lady went normally waiting test results thought ""it allergies"" spread like 30 people one told war time president supposed fight *against* enemy. Debby downer... [pumped kicks intensifies] Hmm, worldometer USA ranked 23rd. honest, that's surprise remember looking month ago around 50 something. aisle something walk down.

An isle something make life raft on. Sooner later, people going anti mask people &amp; won‚Äôt enough support businesses, run business &amp; seen huge decline last week people cancelling reservations. need start spreading memes around like, ""Bill Gates Makes People Think Masks Necessary Memes Use Facial-Recognition Algorithms!"" something.

Maybe get actual Deep State organized start churning leftist memes, get people back track reality. WW2 one biggest economic booms America pretty much got us Great Depression

First all, New Deal got us Great Depression. WW2 production gave us boost top that. Plus GI bill that.

But secondly, dude talking manufacturing (the part ACTUALLY boosted economy). He's talking draft parring luxury consumption resources allocated towards war efforts.

We know Americans would happy manufacture weapons, Saudi Arabia. if, example, needed meat country preserved shipped overseas war effort, think country could go vegetarian 2 weeks, y'know, greater good? would riots people using 2A rights lawmaker decided yes, meat shipped out. least, politicians leadership believe science.

You're getting vaccine. happening. sense hoping anyway. similar flu. proper vaccine, spotty, still important way go specific strains. fool yourself. long time, remain.

The shutdown measures slow spread mitigate hospital loads, stop virus. going get it. are. Low effort, vague comments get downloaded. Sitting Mt. Rubidoux, beer hand, watching several dozen bulldozers attempt drag massive hospital ship Santa Ana riverbed.

It‚Äôs crazy enough 2020 might make happen. thought gonna stay 10-11k one Governor‚Äôs announcements last week mentioned running low testing supplies would pool tests... isn‚Äôt looking good us right now. covers N95 medical grade masks. address anything else, fyi. Let's go Disney World! Yeah see I‚Äôm Illinois went masks 100% masks stores/grocery stores stayed way even stay home order longer effect. imagine...a virus deadly, take test know it. Even develop vaccine effective treatment, pharmaceutical industry keep hands poor, ensuring incomplete mitigation spread death. Pure governmental corruption prove there's zero attempt provide medical treatment unless taxpayers dump trillions pockets pharmaceuticals. Lil less 13k ny back April, although I'd say NY particularly shitty situation since believe positives pretty much hospitalizations.  Oh dang, read it. reason thought 18,000+ one point NY. Idk why. Thanks!  last month testing gone 40%. New cases gone 150%. üéµ sick world, üéµ Freaking crazy.... saw many area Myrtle Beach hot spot teachers! people stupid need go damn beaches cooking badly!?! student, problems whatsoever online course.

No Shit
No Shoes
NO Mask

No Service


Private company priviledge [Took 5 seconds Google article this.

Mask wearing emulate herd immunity way think it.

Also, initial viral load well know thing. search it. I'd say days reasonable wait time potential exposure get accurate testing. incubation period going whether ICU patient asymptomatic carrier. Data isn‚Äôt science. It‚Äôs data. took bar down. set lower. So, logic, Florida removed USA would still #1?

Holy shit. [Enormous backlog tests need look AZDHS click ""Confirmed Cases Day"" note two days June 5,000 cases. AZ never reported 5,000 cases. That's simply far backlog goes back add days tests processed. point reports US records must using template. mind people legally expressing thier rights. saying everyone wrong wrong, one guy. believe would it. NY's highest tally 13k. Keep mind fewer tests available then. Who's celebrating???

Punchlines expense daft leadership, brainwashed followers. Genuinely, rest world's heart breaking average sensible americans, way Brazilians, Italians, Russians, whoever. Give birth mask on. See one. ü§∑üèª

But really we're going keep we've doing. changed habits since March. Mask wearing leave, bringing sanitizer w us. Grocery pick-up. Deliveries. FaceTime. real bummer, I'm sad one happiest moments lives coincidence pandemic, highest priority keeping us, eventually baby, safe.

Edit: also, live South Minneapolis, stayed protests. also completely surprised protests happened (in bigger cities). true. several companies expecting phase 3 trials conclude fall. many tests performed? know positivty rate 15 percent change vote Montana worth 5x vote California lol worries. carpooling üöó home *right now* order escape pandemic Florida. Tidy guest room! (Don't forget fresh towels.)  Road trips fairly low risk take precautions. 9 day road trip really helped mental health. stayed hotels population areas, opened window room arrived wiped surfaces. lot places (no matter where) takeout options getting food issue. Good thing it‚Äôs hoax big deal, even though ordered first refrigerated trucks Phoenix 

But yeah keep fighting good fight wearing mask bc it‚Äôs tyranny obey laws bc live society believe Spain reported R0 3.3 0.5 lockdown. imagine Italy's similar. like way responded comparison places way vaccinate world month make happen even people 100% willing. staff administer many shots. I‚Äôm Seattle, another place highly educated population (also coincidentally liberal well). Although cases state-wide increasing like everyone else‚Äôs, we‚Äôve maintained good numbers almost beginning. 

I go long walk neighborhood every day, estimate 90%+ people see wearing masks leave house anything, even they‚Äôre outside people, amazing. People walk street avoid walking close strangers too. Mask compliance probably close 100% public spaces like grocery stores (minus occasional stray Trumpy moron). Every delivery person comes house last month - masked. even sometimes see people cars wearing masks. Better overkill careful enough right now, though. give fucks coronavirus Seattle, WA.

One issue though, governor pointed recently, young people (college students teenagers) compliant social distancing summer, primary factor driving numbers right now. live teenager allowed socialize person unless she‚Äôs outside mask, says friends allowed go large indoor parties, etc. Anyone allowing kid WA right needs fucking stop - kind thing making drag endlessly US every western nation stuff control. don‚Äôt want living next Arizona Texas don‚Äôt balls tell kid months. Arizona republican governor definitely talking aunt comments post, yes. Refute arguement? thread state Arizona currently experiencing 60X infections entire EU want argue we're 'parabolic curve' europe? fucking kidding right now? want coherrent argument starting position earth flat. GTFOH. LMAO. deaths rising tho probably one Japanese style things everyone sleeps cubes. context, remember Italy hit superhard virus?

Today, new daily cases Florida (15,000) **total remaining active cases** Italy (13,000). absurd.  Good. Save people brains please. I've thinking along line months. Yes!!! double 130+ time booted out, way gets elected again. Hey mate, know numbers fake Argentina. mean, medics family, told true. well 300-400k many deaths considered ""covid"" Last thing need bunch brain damaged Americans! beat saying thing! Honestly, people mean say ‚Äúlate stage capitalism‚Äù. worshiping wealth human well-being gets us. Yeah lots people move California here. It‚Äôs cheaper live it‚Äôs pretty nice except summer time. Living Arizona summer sucks everyone goes inside. work hospital AZ. feel same, many many precautions take get it. frustrating. one best states early on. Reading hard people guess. literally spent 12 years exposing industry disgusted thing free Disney exposure virus! Perhaps should. It'd sure help get rid dumb fucks there. keep mind Sweden still off-limits Europeans due safe considered be.

The USA different country, different type people. trust Swedes Americans comes self-discipline. DeSantis keeps saying increasing testing everything going planned. Yeah everything going well based virus‚Äô plan; yours. Even tent 90+ degree heat would suck! patients infectious 11 days""

Wonder debunked yet. Link reddit comment thread show attention got back then. Dude, even read article?
First clearly state death rate isnt increasing. 
Second, nothing states hospitalized covid patients intensive care otherwise danger purely due covid! full hospital doesnt mean covid, covid doesnt mean dying it.


Try please. worked shifts least week exhibiting symptoms, including cough nausea 
 
I'd concerned customer hearing news. Think going mean coming weeks.

There many variables available hospital spaces, available clinicians, effectiveness treatments, average age.....and on

But aggregate US 3.2MM cases 137K fatalities (round numbers)

In branch mathematics look like 99.6% survival rate (or whatever deniers claim is)? Florida worst 15k today! Still mask order! shit! also testing adequately 3% samples testing positive. Total cases 36k, would mean CFR 2.5% would expect place decent testing. especially impressive since poor densely populated.  fuck think world doing? We're flying AZ 5 days 7 mos extremely cautious PR. feel like we're entering Hot Zone. N95 way, defense wild west non-maskers. Got citation that? Stationing troops Canadian border? Naw. prefers sending overseas. Places like Okinawa. Interesting incoming troops US quarantined arrived there. *off-base* hotels! Think base that's got problem overseas may infecting reinfecting local populace?  times think Trump's Department Defense care much either troops allies. yes risky. stay home ffs. amount people purposely misconstruing comment absolute riot. Unbelievable many happily delusional people are.

I know say nobody thinks that. confidently say don't. know President can't 'control' virus. President intentionally divide country, well encourage supporters brain-dead super spreaders, we'd better now. Trump provides structure, leadership, direction going forward. He's regressive, narcassistic, racist pretending important.  Dont think so. see next week. Yeah reading comprehension? said images. Obviously shit stupid af do. ones chin guards look dumb af better look really foolish. good laugh.. want prune life go ahead. Stupid bad shit happening nearly times. Want serious go ahead. I'm still laughing images. personal experience got. bit attitude schools spending money wastefully, focus many municipalities appearances substance. agree money spent teacher salaries, programs make teachers informed efficient, important cool looking decor.

Probably schools attended made entirely brick, cement, solid wood, industrial materials. kind industrial construction go East Coast city, 70, 80, 100 years later, see still used, highly sought today. Even window door frames steel, heavy, painted steel; still perfectly functional decades. understand country's educational priorities gotten ass-backwards lifetime. Officially 1%

Unofficially 2% summer showers like sauna's. amount mist fans save hell.. 3 hours waiting Animal Kingdom Safari.. 3 HOURS! live rural Kentucky. amount drug abusers caused large number grandparents forced raise grandchildren. know elderly couple custody 9 grandchildren rare case. translation error. 

The German article used ""bis"" means literally ""until"" used like ""by time December vaccine"" exposed client tested positive Covid. direct support professional. extremely upset way situation handled. local health department guidelines state anyone exposed covid work they've 2 negative tests. 
I informed work, tested (it 24hrs since exposed) told sent home unless fever. 
Today 5 days since exposure. 1 negative result scheduled tested Thursday. 
I informed supervisors headache last 3 4 days fever 99.4¬∞F. told inform fever 100.4¬∞F keep working. 100 percent agree you, I‚Äôm age group that‚Äôs around since beginning fb.... hard time wanting delete it

Even tho know probably told wasn‚Äôt allowed wear one. Hence, wore one. Oh god get yourself.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* get mean think issue Americans think usually smartest room. issue ego, pride, bunch things think mainly two. decades telling US number 1, gotten point think never number 1. think main character, main hero. referring person people haha k e s

Why link that

Why would send unsuspecting people It‚Äôs faucci haven‚Äôt talked weeks

Can imagine last conversions had? death percentage trending (with 3 week lag factored in), without hospitals really overwhelmed. think certain folks took virus less deadly obviously appear true. Likely younger demographics, better treatments, flooded hospitals. Look RINO wearing mask! HA! Gonna lose lot cash... GOP members idea h-index is, Dr Fauci, h-index 220 ) one cited scholars ever, true academic giant alive. Coronaviruses display seasonal variation influenza. There's every reason believe summer would reduce rate transmission.

Which would imply reduced rate. Winter may extremely unpleasant. Delaware, forgotten state. Many us care dying general. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø people comply lockdown orders. already seen people generally support policies abide by. want lockdown feel safe work.

Masks also high rates compliance. lot studies demonstrate this. problem masks insufficient stop spread alternative shutting states want do.

So despite mask compliance [two still hear masks issue weren't, might blame people charge. Woo! we're supposed say drugs! people nowadays...We're screwed!!!  Look flood 'we've always taken seriously' posts. hasn‚Äôt worked since 90‚Äôs. anybody tried getting new graphics card? brother rarity then, I'm guessing grad student? Even created one first year existed 40 would 24. people one '04 I'm guessing may older 40. enough people affect across nation, like everyone still sheltered place, gas prices plummeted roads empty? I'd like go back timeframe, quieter then. know two pronged attack?

Prevention second prong. also less expensive labor intensive.

DeDumbass, shut state already! Lol comment.

I‚Äôm relationship expert seen easy thing get over. Everyone wants feel special birthdays sucks situation, every single person made sacrifice something lives virus. best thing rational discussion, like adults have, make decisions there. sucks right you‚Äôre dating awhile know make situation better even don‚Äôt want go out. Posted iPhone bought Chase Credut Card. Yeah long term financial situations matter, quarterly ones do. /s

Edit: apparently gotta /s hope keeps on. Yes, exactly - virus changed much, got much better treating it. seeing 2000 deaths day current [COVID-19 hospitalization first wave, twice less deaths per day average (although trend deaths rapidly increasing right now). 

The US' medical capacity increased much, COVID-19 patients stay hospitals two weeks average, stats like 90% ICU capacity Arizona extremely concerning - hospitals completely beds, ER doctors nurses increasingly overwhelmed. result, hospitals simply resources provide best possible care patients, death rate hospitals starts increasing result. That's MAGA thing would board with. No. Disney world opened. Disneyland. compare Florida california. I've using . idea compares anymore, one might take look shopping around. FWIW, Brazilian states practically unanimous shunning Bolsonaro's laissez faire attitude March.

The Prez could say liked, state governments still people brains residents' health care mind / part populist cult took Bozo power.

""We continue base decisions science health experts"", said.

tl;dr problem US ""deep"", bad advice coming bad federal ""leadership"" Washington, *but also* ""wide"" various state-government acolytes wanting step line even orders pure rubbish.

Addendum: note week, city live lockdown measures overruled state court (Bahia). can't tell yet based good information seems ball may moved -- state also captured biz interests city gov.s wall.  Hawaii seems state able enforce it. I've seen several photos folks, albeit masked, crowding entrance tram like sardines. goes show make place 'as safe possible' people still mess up. typifies US stupidity finest. Smart man. choice fly, Id too. asking country that's obese think long term health make lifestyle choices so.

Good luck. We‚Äôre super cautious! friends kids it. kids mild, (healthy thin!) parents eight weeks. beach pretty damn safe. unless mean one florida beaches like billion people lol Really surprised found tyvek suit big enough logic cases exploding, that's statistical anomaly even true?

That week record amounts cases hospitalizations fall death numbers? I've seen research. suggests crowded outdoor events pose little threat covid spread. seems little need worry types events. government get money feed provide money everyone? everything could... like send positive patients back nursing homes? whole family rips states every day lol. Canada watching nightmare south horrific, you‚Äôre politicians trying get us open border. Build wall! seems majority Americans ridiculously stupid chance. say ‚Äúof course wore mask, he‚Äôs hospital,‚Äù ‚Äúit personal choice wear mask. choose to.‚Äù 28-35%, 10-20 Depends. Short term yes, long term probably not. lab-confirmed case numbers U.S surged last week two meaning deaths also rise soon well. rise case numbers cause rise deaths too, therefore, RIGHT deaths seem kinda low compared total cases could change soon since takes time new cases turn fatal cases. Hospitals reportedly operating full capacity good news terms trying lower death rate. Surprised wear mask saying ""white Power"" true. remember going honeymoon end April one year. already 90 degrees breeze Obama probably actually self-isolating code Chinese invasion?  explain detail math? Isn‚Äôt accurate % one dead vs recovered? mask looks *so* bad him! looks weak unmanly. /s Well, goals life good foil have. Mine ended due problems something else. 

Sometimes, nice person around. make feel better. Sometimes, annoying. figure want, pandemic definitely test see they'll handle serious issue. true. work ‚ÄúDisney‚Äù people planned vacations still intend go. They‚Äôre actually irritated virus messed plans. Fucking crazy. Stay home!!!!! It‚Äôs sad many people going learn hard way... comments wearing masks:

1. Wearing mask controversial topic France (yet). 

2. mandatory wear one public transport. advised inside general (shops etc.). common (like 90% ppl whatever) wear mask outside. 

3. bus driver asked fuckers obey rules. included wearing mask also buying tickets. story masks !! could refused entrance reason would ended way. Again, wearing mask controversial we've sick stories like bus drivers getting beaten try enforce rules.

4. women household. crazy wear mask outside next people share roof. 

Only reason makes headlines controversial topic mask country journalists make story masks. Stop judging women (who lost dad/husband ffs). bus driver trying make savage people obey rules. rules. specifically advocating masks - job refusing entrance buy tickets probably enough story end tragically anyway... I'm going leave cost less excess mortality 2000 flu season, noone considered locking for. demonstrating stay useless Haha - finally fooled him! end elaborate hoax. Jokes him! must feel really stupid now. /s I'm reassured regularly decision get FB account right one. lot family members Mexico want authorities know family members died virus usually bodies cremated soon found out,"" Mexico, customary bury bodies, choice that's made religious reasons country that's 90% Catholic.

That's awful.

Edit: typo much spread household spread? I'm sure people think lot know difficult find US prices outrageous. twat Mike Davis replying tweet research claiming need masks scientists explicitly stated that's opposite findings fine. go stand midday sun cool down.


When used chef I'd take quiet moments stand fridge seconds. Granted UK rather Italy, there's escapes heat A/C.


Standing next 400¬∞C pizza oven make huge difference 30¬∞C 15. sweating either way. drink liquids keep going. Easy say. Probably gotta stay home coding job. world revolve around upper 20 percent making killing pandemic.  coworker, Texas, going universal studios.  sees issue that.

I started college 05 created FB then. 18-22 year old undergrads. false positive house well. partner participating COVID-19 research study mails sample nose every week. four negatives, one Friday June, positive immediately following Monday, negative Wednesday another negative Thursday next week another mail away negative. never symptoms. literally hasn‚Äôt building home dermatologist‚Äôs office (less 15 minute melanoma check, masked, patient building) since March 11. getting somewhere around nine total negative tests, one positive, company running research study finally admitted possible false positive. incredibly resistant idea test could wrong, heard ER admitting doctor area routinely false positives patients admitting hospital reasons. got tested, housemate got tested, none us positive. symptoms. two literally haven‚Äôt grocery shopping, seen friends, etc. work remotely. go shopping every two weeks. taking seriously possible. 

So believe false positives exist. ""aides"" harmful people admin unfortunately Kushner freaking pull WH Chief Staff. exactly mess due people like Kushner retarded ""modeling"" projection COVID early stages. guys complete bubble. Active cases almost certainly less 1/3 now.

Remember little testing done US peak first wave late March/early April. vast majority America's 40 million tests done period.

The result number cases March April *massively* undercounted recent infections represent much smaller percentage total infections official statistics suggest. symptoms I've lately... really freaking out. But, like come gone... Today tightness chest. American insistence limitless personal ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù insanity 

Agreed, particularly empowers dumb make whatever choices want, OK freedom. insane dullards people cry ""elites"" experts making decisions complex problems somehow violates Constitution.

Maybe something like dormatory hostel, would true 

It's like we're talking warehouse space need multiple units order comfortably adjust maintain temperature throughout whole space. total death without lockdown. states entering ""no fucking way control shit"" phase extremely hard lockdowns might help regain control month implemented. 

Other that, one knows happens 10 times people needing hospitals hospitals. anecdotal Haha ive saying THERES NOTHING UNITED US yearrrrs. üíØ you. Scary huh? eminent worries, write ""COVID-19 over"" bus so.  Probably polite, ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù. Finally military started actually defending country.

Rigging election quite difficult (in case U.S.) single election. 50 separate elections. would much easier rigg one election.


So going us. generation‚Äôs lead paint? Additional details another source:

According [Yahoo 70% cases people 20s 30s. Imagine US took 200 cases seriously. Flash mobs, fuck this, 2010? course bunch middle-aged, out-of-touch morons think they're taking stand oppressive... personal protective equipment. really wanted confront culpability, thread people young healthy died might help reflection problem us cares much econemy saving lives. 

That's it. really cared long term health economy we'd need take care virus instead letting fester. knock-on effects pandemic remaining crisis mode end year much greater we've far.

Americans really care economy. care quick buck. care living luxury today mortgage future pay present. else, COVID crisis indictment ability long term plan.

Hey Bill, become highest bidder get people need them? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø UK culturally different US, point I'm making lot comments seem keep comparing us same.

From I've seen, reluctance US wear mask stems mainly two ideas: 

* can't tell do, right wear mask

* COVID hoax

In UK however, culturally conditioned make fuss, stand out, like strangers looking us, feel...shame inadequate happens. yes, feeling overrides understanding masks save lives.

On top that, there's mixed messages weak Government flip flop issues, take forever implement anything. Even now, say England *might* bring rule face coverings *in next weeks*.

Personally think anything science either direction. think there's much said UK average bloke street ""Well research says won't"". more... ""Well need to, government would tell so"".

I absolutely believe nations Great Britain would wear masks issue (save idiots) government came strong, nonsense, excuses message. 

I said ages ago, one short TV message Queen would enough. Even photo Prince Charles, Prince William would enough many British people feel like they've absolved embarrassment go mask without feeling inadequacy. Clinton 3 million votes mate dunno, Europe pensions they're fine. Coronavirus hit less hard too. Maybe something reduced private healthcare costs free public healthcare can't want afford private.

RIP someone sounded like extraordinary person Keep bars open boys.. it‚Äôs uphill I‚Äôve read bit study edit comment necessary in-depth read, mention buy us time vaccine becomes available. direct proof reducing droplet transmission transmission population. example, wearing mask reduces spread 5 ft one might assume transmission can‚Äôt occur past that. But, study linked shows, even isolation Arctic isn‚Äôt enough stop transmission. Also, assuming mask use reduce transmission effectively, it‚Äôs effective majority people it. worry Americans can‚Äôt that, mainly politics surrounding issue. I‚Äôm referring to. Non-wearers pitfalls strategy. Anyways, point mask use best way buy time vaccination worst, like said, inconvenience. fall side masks probably help.

I don‚Äôt mind wearing mask, I‚Äôm also going say something haven‚Äôt shown do. studies make lot assumptions may turn wrong. It‚Äôs important aware that. But, I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre wrong either. need data. now, agree people wear masks.

Edit: Read it‚Äôs compelling argument. Still room debate conclusive evidence. Yeah gotcha! open window sounds important me. I‚Äôll tell her. Thank you! think anyone ignores it. fully aware consequences care.

Piorty groups like healthcare workers elderly get first, people believe science go next, time enough supply rest, people somewhat skeptical seen healthcare workers suffering form serious complications come fence. effective enough even matter whether hardcore anti-vaxxers get not. need multiple courts practice facilities well. Disney those. thought ""damage"" means ""scar tissue"". thought scar tissue permanent. type lung damage permanent? Small question end care read wall text. Also I'll upvote funny talk funny feel vindicated feel vindicated time. think anywhere near 90% correct saying months ago.

Yeah, I've thought lot - knew feel vindicated. scope, pretentious though sounds, really wide. talking large part history humanity, half year disruption appreciate admit underestimating overflow hospitals. I'd appreciate could also address number deaths comparison seasonal said probably won‚Äôt kill seasonal flu, takes 400,000 every year.

I obviously wrong, greatly so. moment killed 560k (I'd verify numbers google totally infested coronavirus results would mean like 10m searching whatevs). That's course quarantines, we're halfway done year, may well increase lot, doubt I'll factor (edit: factor off, 6 million would surprise me. current situation US, may well wrong - I'll admit thought US/Trump would handle less insanely incompetently). thing said EARTH give inkling fuck responded really care give fuck not. promise soon laughing disease back then. still laughing?

At people thought/think would humanity-threatening disease? Yes. lot people thought would result near-collapse humanity. Working home unusual most, hardly completely earth shattering. deaths incredibly unfortunate, many business owners think really carefully business, unable adapt sure, still feel correct said biggest impact would economic.

Obviously like laugh situation people miserable, think whole lot people vastly overestimated severity this, serious though think fair say effects economic. Sure global economy taken huge hit far that. Life changed. know life has. office work closed months remain closed rest year. remote employee. can't travel abroad places world....we've banned. restaurant movie theater concert months. able watch sports months stopped playing games. Real estate city 15% economic factor also result people leaving city going countryside.

All ultimately economic impact, course human happiness tied much (entertainment, restaurants etc.). *really* much sacrifice? Stay indoors bit more, maybe even wear mask outside. think that's huge impact all. like we're collectively burying old sick young half adult population, economy changed hundred years there's huge shortage laborers say life changed all? someone know thing yet? deaths (I hope not!). know two people lost parent thing...very sad. Meanwhile parents leave house 3 months account high risk (and everything closed). depressed feel many years life left losing time could enjoying themselves. retired years ago. truth know lot people depressed. virus absolutely horrible world...I think overstating impact back originally chatted.

Fortunately almost completely unaffected it, except working home, really big deal me. understand empathize people feel far greater need casual human interaction though.

However, really ultimately, months worth quarantine wearing mask much ask people. Again, personal opinions coloured view - honestly even really think fact people might become irrationally lonesome bored, would perfect breeding ground conspiracy theories ""hoax"". reaffirm much ask people, expect many people low bar for, well, basic courtesy. 

Which leads last point: view situation soured start, introduced via conspiracy-sources, sources usually think everything going wrong minute, need hyper-aware million silly little things. introduced evidence researcher American lab took flight China, and/or stopped airport shortly first outbreak something, somehow evidence of... someone releasing US. 

This excuse - opinion slight - carelessness situation, thought relevant.

Lastly, good measure, thought mention relied lot WHO, believe disingenuous numbers information. China forthcoming information, really position publicly doubt them. numbers people need intensive care/the death rate, feel simple google search might take factors account somehow, I'll leave out.

Very lastly wall text: believe overestimated impact disease way, feel vindicated I? fun, could give loose ball-park % right feel were, did?  Again, that's based antibody tests still debate. reason say 20% would lead 100% 20% infected, implies shit transmits easily 1 5 people it, people get infected would people literally 0 contact human beings month March. NYC virtually one. poor guy.  Exactly! horseshit argument ‚Äúwell death rate low, everyone stop dramatic‚Äù ridiculous.

Why would want sick cut chances wearing piece fabric must leave home?! don‚Äôt get it. 

Also, yay St. Pete, hi neighbor I'm sure comment supposed mean. Covid affecting everyone, black brown people killed twice rate. Unemployment higher communities too. Lets start deifying anyone yet. Fauci taking cruises

Muh freedoms ass. Deaths lag cases. get messy week much longer trump say magically goes away again? you‚Äôre first second year student. It‚Äôs mostly GEs intro courses transfer credits, even less they‚Äôre online courses. 

Once you‚Äôve gotten past intro courses major taken GEs you‚Äôre luck. Amen, brother Ah yes, tunnel vision public health experts care about... public health  it‚Äôs actually worse

Actually, full context, isn‚Äôt. 

He also said anyone wants wear mask wear mask, at-risk populations, health providers, anyone symptoms, etc. **Your choice.** 

He also said guidelines decided time. Because, know, Fauci makes recommendations literally set national policy. that‚Äôs president‚Äôs job. need Fauci right now, knows do. probably taking patience resign right now. Rapid deceleration trauma. positivity rate yesterday actually bit ~20% 15%. Got tested couple weeks back (fortunately negative), took full week. know people can't afford sit around week without pay MAYBE COVID. FL test infrastructure really joke. [""There‚Äôs new theory Florida, coronavirus pneumonia deaths. Read probably read first.

You also look data. Crazy concept right?

Go to: ""Weekly Number Deaths Cause Subgroup"" select jurisdiction Florida. see crazy numbers there, promise.

9 Upvotes. Complete bullshit. Fitting sub. Leave poor man alone, he's job say sad? ""Mandatory masks"" really mean anything even Japan. ""mandatory masks"" office yet people taking time anyway, especially speaking.... shoot resorts are. mean... guess Covid party success?

Condolences family others surely infected. ""Narrow focus"" ""keeping citizens alive well""  comments like this, ""Another idiot pile,"" increases divide country, people, experiencing. Yes, behavior beyond ignorant, horrifying.

But behavior nothing widening divide.

Pity them, never stop preaching ignorant change. 

To less makes **YOU** monster. Check r/MaskSkepticism \- people absolutely moronic this. need mind bleach after, check r/Masks4All . Murica! Fuck Yeah! fuck around, find out?

Have covid kool-aid party, let us know turns you. Can't wait hear. can‚Äôt imagine giving many factually wrong statements one quote. would think bunch kindergartners sticking things mouths touching everything could problem. bailouts industries stealing working class people present future taxation. baby boomers retirement matter needs working class millenials like myself. Many baby boomers pulled ladder behind them, calling generation lazy entitled born one best economies. boomers largely backed back Trump statistically ignored advice got us mess.

Also, since corporations banks legally people, working class people getting equivalent aid. got one $1200 check essential worker risking life front lines. elite getting many times boomers invested them, sit home tax payer provided benefits (many retired) add less actually contributed taxes count bailouts industries. many others getting way else bootstraps everyone.. stupid? ""your problem me"" thing. Also there's reason electricity consumed made. Arizona stupid place build town city. matter produce 10 mega watts energy consumed dumb shit like cooling house middle desert would love hear Fauci uncensored.

I feel like close happening. Every day seems like getting fed bullshit. much respect man. Bottom feeding drug addict calling shit fake, hilarious Yeah, since [late Back estimated delivery date September USA. However, find much information since regarding timeline. reported sunday, numbers always lower actual trend. agree guy, person picture looks like unhealthy individual, quite obese. Also says person 26 looks waaaaay older 26 think mean gathering people pandemic? take serious precautions even may plan funerals. allowed state fact try help people, live delusion treat obesity like hereditary trait medical issue (with hereditary causes cases) single case TERRIBLE way judge quickly spreading early. statistically going around clip board qualify death causes nuts.

We reporting deaths 'coronary pneumonia'.

Average deaths per year - deaths year = covid.

Perfect? no. Accurate? yes. THanK won‚Äôt argue that. disaster here. live Texas. media blowing shit proportion. majority hospitals running usual nothing crazy. media cherry picking COUPLE hospitals around huge state progress red man bad narrative. nonsense.
Edit: downvoting me? little perspective media lies worthy votes? Sheesh Agreed, travel aspect concerns Disney Casinos Vegas. Thanks explanation, I've bit unease speed vaccine developed, worried skipped steps.

Look people downvoting I‚Äôm speaking truth instead shocked young person died covid. Here's demo video send fly - last one plane wear mask. Would recommendation?

This virus survival rate. likelihood, catch virus point. you. also likelihood, survive. absolutely worried virus, shouldn‚Äôt either.  

‚ÄúBut muh masks protecting others‚Äù. Please. wear masks flu season? go work sick? ever glanced phone you‚Äôre freeway? Besides, people actually risk (elderly, etc) take precautions want. Herd immunity we‚Äôre going end this. ‚ÄúBut Europe cases now!‚Äù open back take masks cases rise nobody built immunity.


Tell me, last time shut society wore masks for....anything? shut McDonald‚Äôs can‚Äôt go anymore clog arteries, end putting strain medical system couldn‚Äôt eat healthy exercise? federal government guidelines send back care homes. source Rona DeathSentence working South Korea form response? literally said going start quarantines appeared trumps initial stance changed. One densest populations US compared florida 21 million people spread across giant peninsula 15k single day average 9 days delay testing death toll miraculously increased covid 19 deaths along comparable scale country state world. I‚Äôm sure drastic increases pneumonia, stroke, heart attacks seeing coincidence. isolation makes crazy. 

living large multicultural city completely different living middle nowhere neighbors 30 miles away look like do. 1.4 billion people went 10,000 tests April 200,000 now.

We like 1/5 population 4 times testing.

I'd say numbers dont reflect reality. guess idea much bettern everybody thinks ypu scientist think logical abput every problem would assume would also lead reasonable actions mean everyone hates speeding parking tickets still get them.
I think hard ticket people wearing masks indoors. stupid fucking wall. Get it, moron. Itll never envision. people even thinking people work school system teachers deal students day long.

Personally I'm happy wife's school contract negotiations right now. Feels like good time play hardest hardball. Nobody wants school anyway. Trump cares economy. really SPY/NASDAQ unemployment numbers. schools remote would cause unemployment go due bus drivers janitors laid off. wants coronavirus burn September October get public ""forget"" push economic recovery. 

But doesnt realize dead kids teachers would even worse people get know someone like normal scandals. 45 entirety Florida today. state 20m people. Don‚Äôt stress it! central KY. aware. go far, people seriously idiots, starting think reason China realized people would *ignore means movement control*.

Those P100 filters. right version 3M 60921 organic-vapor P100 respirator filter. cartridge-style filters. available couple months ago Amazon, they're harder find now. round 3M 2097 filters seem readily available Amazon. Beware, since counterfeits both.

What 3M (and sources seem say), they're effective they're dirty, longer breathe them. saw one study P100 filters/cartridges claimed effective 30 days' use. both. incredibly stupid system keeps people jobs despise (because whole family could lose health insurance lost job) punishes small businesses, often can't afford pay employees' health care. Unfortunately, private insurance prohibitively expensive tied employer. fair wear mask may one point first time know.... sayin good news. love NYC hope muffukers get chance chill thing comes back around finish job. Love. Nope. STUDY **NOT** SARS2. isn‚Äôt even social mitigation, ffs. It‚Äôs wearing masks symptomatic flu ... HOME. 

It also says: **We concluded household use masks associated low adherence ineffective controlling seasonal ILI.**

And studies SARS1 show *that* coronavirus wasn‚Äôt spread asymptomatically presymtomatically. Unlike SARS2, largely is. 

Thanks proving point clearly. I‚Äôm saving link. :)

That ended expected. Cheers. name doesn‚Äôt check out. campaign ads brutal. Something something holding kids hostage. Southern deaths clock 500,000+ counting, there's enough dead kids, too, Trump clock cleaned. forget buck stops absolutely anywhere party personal responsibility.

You could read article linked... Teenagers, mommy_tits, conspiracy... Yikes seems like odd conclusion make nowhere.

I work college, preparing best reopen waiting approval. Although intention sending kid back public schools fall reopen. I‚Äôm arguing preventative solutions. think best option.

But it‚Äôs mutually exclusive situation. agree everyone wear masks, social distance, etc. think it‚Äôs good idea people improve overall health.

There underlying health problems people control over. Obesity one them. big part obesity behavioral. Behavior changed. Tf free movement issue go across European borders especially live nearby. Hope stay safe. spreading discriminate.  long we're talking BattleBots, would fun see Witch Doctor exhibition match UK's Donald Thump (if robot still exists).  upvote kindness. didn‚Äôt mean come self-righteous elitist. case anyone read that, assure you, intention. fact, agreed you. still do.

To me, thinking Coronavirus political poker chip...it disgusts me. However, may looking idealistic way, may fault response‚Äôs perceived tone thinking short-term (the virus), election come November. that‚Äôs shot able think long-term. all. fact, I‚Äôm jealous can‚Äôt better myself.

As far serial killer analogy goes, praising Trump all, see point. Narratives always pounced upon closest politician benefit most, isn‚Äôt different. But, allowing false narrative circulate benefits ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù...is good take, either (and goes kind take, either side aisle, one particular).

Thanks response! downvotes, good. Discord good. everyone agree me, also good.  lot people live Florida. They're gonna taking back across country. Wishing uncle speedy recovery. Stay safe homie. Heh. consider 99% Orlando residents go. 

They'll get it, fly back god knows where. 

At least bars night clubs, remains rather local. basically every news article someone 30s 40s dying it. Look picture person, they're almost always significantly overweight.  Deaths lag 2-4 weeks behind spike positive tests. deaths reported positive tests reported 2-4 weeks ago. keep climbing. opened Disney World üôÑ can't float hospital ship Central Texas.... maybe dirigable? ...... lmao want scream caps, ""What fuck expect?""

It's like watched moron point gun foot day saying, ""I'm gonna it,"" sat there... 24 hours. Waiting him. it. shoots like, ""WHY FUCK HAPPEN?"" Probably wearing masks? I'm personally waiting videos packed ICUs like saw China, Italy, NYC. terrifying nothing's done feel videos right around corner reality Texas Florida. sick went Florida? Instacart, Doordash, Amazon, etc. unsolved problem. newborn grocery store months (which sucks like picking produce). totally survive without leaving home grocery shopping.  office, employer never closed. get essential businesses supposed stay open dont understand fast food considered essential surprised Iran‚Äôs deputy health minister filmed end February, clearly unwell, sweating coughing press conference. next day ( remember correctly) diagnosed COVID-19

Edit : think purpose press conference say things weren‚Äôt bad claimed. coastal areas going get absolutely pounded virus. Dunedin yesterday driving (and along causeway get there) saw people PACKING beaches, masks sight, everyone mainstreet... nobody giving single shit.

We're going hit 50,000 cases day over. hell let get bad? Yes. Wash sanitize hands. Better ventilation systems, even open windows! worry, Americans still act vaccine miraculously fall sky moment bad dream. hope Fauci snaps goes town showing he's right along. 

I mean again, dick bags even believe science. say leaving house, mean literally physical willed house? leaving general area still going walks whatnot?

Edit: nvm saw reply. know hot go outside least 15 minute walk. day confinement healthy.. getting outdoor exercise walks. Try go morning avoid people.  Here's thing, public health expert look narrow perspective, public health perspective.

Just finance person look finance perspective. talk outside expertise.

The job leader look relevant data relevant areas make best decision.

Consider scenario, 10 sick people room. save person paying $1,000, time save person, price multiplies 10.

A public health professional might say save all. finance person might say save people might still able contribute cost society.

Because literally jobs. job leader make final decision looking over.

What's different circumstance they're weighing options, since he's giving bad news, he's 100% fake liar can't trusted.

The words correct, looking narrow perspective, grounds dismiss everything say. Poor Michigan. Biden wins. already promised cure cancer elected. People dying cancer every day holding back cure. monster. Well thing herd immunity humans dealt diseases historically quite successfully. don‚Äôt see nature‚Äôs solution shamed historically successful solution disease exists, much better proven lockdowns Sweden, researchers also found staff members day cares primary schools likely people working professions contract 1.3 million EU citizens work cross-border, think pretty people notoriously stuborn speaking languages. know Netherlands almost everyone border regions speaks German, vice-versa. Movie Theatres make money food sell, actual ticket. actual fuck could reasoning possibly be? actually quick wealth transfer hospitals model assumes equal mobility vector equal vulnerability vector infection, well equal infectiousness potential infected person is. studies coming showing assumptions variable think. mention research hints immunity built modalities (T-cells) without antibody level. Uhh..have paying attention? Tourism worldwide dying, island city not.

Per capita, rate infection death nearly bad. yet. Good?  context two weeks ago (15 days) hit 10m. Sweden, researchers also found staff members day cares primary schools likely people working professions contract  Yes. Oh shit, *THAT* band? Yikes worry, really immunity gained second infection less severe first, old risk groups simply die time become new normal. average age get much lower means younger people get politics higher ranks companies make country better. It'll like seasonal flu asymptomatic survive. I'm quite sure getting covid give kind immunity, and/or second infection easier.

I would think way, focus studies building good habits traveling etc happening, graduate everything better, one way another. Get ahead others age group(who mostly waste time worrying complaining) get good job.  Could ask hiring tutor involved part homeschooling? wanted know thinking starting offer affordable distance math tutoring whose schools closed opting homeschool. surge strains testing supplies means testing symptomatic anyway. We're far capacity needed proactive testing high risk situations (opening schools) seem made progress. capacity produce tests equipment? Freaking build capacity. problem clearly going long time. probably ought learn lesson emergency capacity ready mobilize future too. School districts get federal funds go special education high-poverty areas, kids need extra support. still tiny percentage funding compared funds, loss would still wreak havoc school budgets. real. read posts comments.

Totally agreed police military gear though What, like society built reward sociopathic could *possibly* trouble responding crisis requires teamwork, empathy, sacrifice? None Southern states get even near New York‚Äôs total deaths. can‚Äôt believe victory laps I‚Äôm seeing comments. long enough people get form herd immunity, doubts fucking United States... forget people died suspicious circumstances hinted towards covid, never tested, thus never included figures. Well said 2005 called they'd like joke back you‚Äôre 50 years old healthy shape, you‚Äôre panicking nothing. Kids even better position based mortality rates. Check cleared. Apology issued. f-ing virus ever get racist, anti maskers anti vac ers?!?! Obviously don‚Äôt want see anyone go covid damn think resistive touch panels, need something hard tip. Plastic good scratches screen less metal. Maybe get cheap plastic stylus carry you? disinfect tip hand sanitizer using. Jacked economy dug deeper fiscal hole go backwards... timeline fucked Awesome, makes everything ok again. person started outbreak symptoms test positive...? 

Why hell would started outbreak person first detected? problem can't take kinds posts seriously anymore people saying since phase 1. Let's forget constant shaming people parks early on.

I'll agree we're looking another tragic round data says so. witness street. good citizen get vaccination every 30 days. ran smoke first building falling lost bunch friends day. They‚Äôre different events horrible. think majority following quarantine. town looks like lot people staying summer. Well, can't argue that. many normal? many died COVID would died anyway? pneumonia related respiratory causes... everything? time schools reopen, wonder that's going turn out... check comment, think that's looking for.  friend mine immunologist told herd immunity achieved easy way hard way. hard way vaccinations. easy way involves piles bodies streets. know it! much optimism University crowd. Lot invincibility feels age plus they'll finally parents house want party friends. Covid spread like wildfire love news, hope right. moderate covid confirmed PCR IGG IGH antibodies. would happy again. Kids two go school, CMIIW. enthusiasm perp walk. NEWS ONE PLACES ACTUALLY WEAR MASK. ffs. Staten Island Bay Ridge too. Y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt alone. 

One corner bars recently opened outdoor seating they‚Äôve completely taken entire corner sidewalk space. course there‚Äôs tables right next other, people congregating without masks super close other. 

You know. Totally safe whatnot. Including chances election  GOOD. Maybe cult members start. Yup. Getting flashbacks March loading $DIS puts preparation inevitable closing. Guess i'll getting another opportunity. even need expert explain this. somebody think billionaires?! Unfortunately, can‚Äôt see every single teacher striking plenty people don‚Äôt think virus big deal aren‚Äôt wearing masks aren‚Äôt social distancing also teachers. Boy, mask makes hands look really tiny. eyes squinty, too. I'd take chances corona rather taking chinese vaccine might first time listened to... anything

Let's honest: probably required wear mask

edit: military hospital... required. might pumpers pushing agenda? post link direct download PDF even? That's weird everyone, tell looks stupid. He'll take get sick. hello not-relevant-bot I'm 900 cal diet. cake speak of? :O Beat it! Yeah would.... would still prefer child abuse though Obama's america people prison Trump's America? Eye opening, really Great White Surprised red presidential mask. never masks

.. and, yet Donald Trump said Americans might wear face masks way prevent spread coronavirus way ‚Äúsignal disapproval Someone family circle died yesterday Covid, 58 years age. Everytime start thinking I'm overdoing handwashing, sanitizers, face shields, see/hear another case, death. hitting home. Ditto.

I friend conservative, reasonable met gf, married. zealot Dubya would post kinds one-sided crap. let go, egregious stuff would counterpoint. We'd go back forth times (sometimes he'd step back up) would give up. Eventually, sent message tired time patience keep playing referee, keep views myself.

It took couple days could respond, told I'm going make choose there's contest. husband would choose friends wife unless wanted end marriage. unfriended pretty much cut ties him. views welcome, we're really friends.

He crossed paths months later, acted like nothing happened. guess realize deep cut. told felt went down, apologized said mean way, really buy it, friendship never recovered.

I got text blue couple years later, asked around. I'd deleted contact info changed phones times, so, know, ""New phone, dis?"" sent messages back forth, invited join event met years before, declined due scheduling time commitments. offered meet sometime grab beers catch up, never did. wound changing phone number later unrelated reasons end....

It still disappoints today. üòü cool guy, shit taste women. February fucking dumbass. Clearly changed weeks later. different Texas Florida probably still believe concerned flu.

Nice try idiot. even dumber took advice February held stone. pay attention months come.

Again, saying deaths something proud appear something single person would get right? telling got way NY responded? Yeah right. GTFO idiot. laughed hard reason. thanks, lol. internal polling might finally struck home

I believe second he‚Äôs suddenly become leader Deaths lagging indicator. deaths going spike, well know next couple weeks. know else blood hands? anybody voted independent, republican, vote last presidential election. good show. nephew wants watch time hes even mind.

\---T-cells usually last longer confer longer immunity antibodies B cells. That's shame. damn shame. Yikes! I'm sorry. fact matter protests produced surprisingly small number cases size

Someone missed entire point article. could trust anything science community related protests openly admit can't explain behavior logic.

Anytime people gather crowds risks increases. Unless prove virus distinguishes reasons people gathered, behaving irrational brave scientists admitting behavior. 

Final point. Imagine outrage, imagine quick doctor would cancelled sing current narrative? Reddit someone risks mega amount downvotes, real life people lose jobs, lives destroyed innocently point something go line whatever loudest voices demand right now. 11k kids Florida already it. want open schools.üëÄ  wearing mean he'll wear carry line necessary wore masks 

That's major exaggeration: Can't restrict second amendment! Guy probably went bought three AR-15 right They'll hopefully making red MAGA versions, might encourage folks actually wear one   part physical! Done without warning middle night! Physicals always broken many pieces reason! normal! that's confirmed cases... I‚Äôm sure number includes positives retests too. said dont cases kid 10 infecting adult contact tracing.

That's pretty significant needs study.

Edit: another study done echoing propose safely sending kids back school massive uptick infections positivity rates? Also even covid 19 didn‚Äôt long term health problems post recovering 0% chance kill children, children getting spreads parents, someone taught past, guarantee way convince elementary middle school kids wear masks day keep distance, doubt could majority high school students either. personally think keep schools closed it‚Äôs safe reopen them, moment it‚Äôs safe reopen much would like brother go back school much would like person classes university. open fall we‚Äôre already recording record number daily increases new infections, 70k cases day drastically increase. Schools open literally best case scenario someone wants virus spread much possible. supporters find way make martyr regardless leaves office. instead textbook say ""coloring book"" he's probably following instructions, even often goes outside lines? Eh, governor pretty epic right now- he's almost distraction Trump. really think possible politician worse Trump- but, yeah, tend forget Trump live state run someone manages even worse.. lol It‚Äôs fucking time contains three, what's point? Might gross negligence easier charge make stick? Yeah problem different types classifications they've created. literally got update days ago warning anyone downtown Kelowna June 23- July 3rd(roughly?). guess contact tracing they've discovered someone covid spent time restaurants/bars etc.. countries lockdown that, still spread eventually started growing. Also lockdown densely populated areas difficult maintain, especially poor countries. US also, population divide idea lockdown protests denial lead infections. want say total lockdown help case otherwise much point except initial relaxation hospitals. US 330 million people.

1 330. cases old. significantly lower that's actually active.  majority parents want kids return school safely. live area feel way. day, went small store three people without masks. left didn‚Äôt buy anything. Hmmm... may want brush history lessons. I'd say start somewhere around Sept. 1, 1939 Preach! I'm boat. Always feel like vast underestimation teachers actually do. Yeah makes scared angry lack masks see. actually unfollow family social media bc false propaganda anti-masking (including one who‚Äôs entire family got virus), giving anxiety making angry.  number confirmed cases 4-10x lower number actual cases, mean we‚Äôve effectively hit 4-10%? that‚Äôs true, see exponential increase cases soon reach numbers required immunity. I‚Äôve seeing 66-70% US. Thank you! Pee ocean. go bar. Problem solved build wall around Texas. completely bananas. saw law firm State Indiana share message basically said ‚ÄúIf feel rights threatened recent mandate wear mask, give us call tell fucking stupid are.‚Äù Herpes.

It‚Äôs sad. People problem ‚Äî virus. Never sadder story told Disney equated mass illness death. Nice brand recognition. normal cynical, normal accept false information government health officials. give correct that. go look bit harder.... look test trace. Compare budgets spent it. 

Also clear elimination virus way economic recovery put public health centre.

This really English exceptionalism finest. interesting see well recording compared countries, obviously come minutes don‚Äôt want wear one either, it‚Äôs required store need really want enter. Otherwise stay home participate economy. chronically overheated normal conditions due autoimmune disease masks miserable. Stores could least turn temperature compensate. There'll plenty food, necessarily variety used too. Seasonal labour generally specific crops major staples mechanised harvesting. even wear mask right. One photo saw Twitter earlier shows nose exposed mouth covered mask Check reply bot really needs tuned. Think eliminated comment said mom believed consp*racy theories Q/Anon  No, dont care facemasks used uneducated feel disingenuous claim much better amount people dont wear masks correctly, dont change often enough, dont use gloves keep fiddling/touching let alone dont dispose correctly contribute spread.

Its like putting condom hole in. think safer but.... hits hundred day, stopping it. That's pattern I've seen time time again. hundred today thousands weeks now. real question clearly didn‚Äôt source UK cases wtf use form opinion there‚Äôs increasing wave there? 

You literally admitted didn‚Äôt know find information. 

So, like, think knew information didn‚Äôt know get, think knew well rude people? 

This isn‚Äôt rhetorical question. really want know came wrong information. happy need wish. virus disappeared completely BLM protests disappear november. Thank god never late right thing, especially now. According Trump scientists surprised knows much science. Man would much happier ending. conserve supplies, maybe quarantine non-perishable items 3-4 days touching them. leave groceries mailed packages garage least 72 hours. Obviously perishables get quarantined designated area fridge/freezer.

As wiping things... Contact time important. Read directions Disinfectant using. Good rule thumb disinfecting must visibly SATURATE let air dry (~2 minutes) order ensure neutralized pathogens. Wiping away solution may allow enough time destroy virions. also worked Germany, Austria, well, Europe, Korea, Japan, ...

If restrict families parents essential workers (police, medical staff, people working essential shops food supply chain, infrastructure workers on), disease peaking, groups small kept separated easily.

And kids age actually need care - e.g 6th grade. branding beside point. means mask came him, implies brought plan use it.

If talked using one got there, probably wouldn‚Äôt branded unless happened POTUS-branded mask handy. don‚Äôt think likely. exposed liar, response ""I care"".

I think see are. Darwin going really hard time year give award single winner. incredible many people mentality ""it's open, okay go out"" agree social aspect, that's used go. teach English online part-time gig, lot Japanese students said online drinking parties become really popular (a bunch friends hop Zoom eat dinner/drink 'together' chatting fun.) Sounds like best possible solution right now, anyway. Corona airborne, masks used majority people really decoration.

Do forget 60% fatalities England homes elderly. would one easiest exercises give masks old folks. So, either done help. ask people England working homes.

I know Singapore foreign workers concentrated dormitories much 40 000 infected people despite masks. course, masks consider decoration.  find funny all. find dangerous, since people likely infect everyone else. I'm missing point. used Israel sent anywhere else answered question enforced. 

Most developed countries issue keeping people isolation need isolated. He's correct, Scotland small population, largely spread density 2 main cities. also hub national / international travel.

Scotland always fair better England, would hard too... done anything particularly different England / Welsh strategy.. maybe parents teach kids tell difference internet troll quality information source, could say I‚Äôm teaching future kids America invaluable lesson, im basically internet hero. please awards necessary don‚Äôt praise it‚Äôs right thing  Half damn stories would Onion material January. got fight today 30 year old little brother this. lives elderly mother (still, yes). sharing garbage anti-mask/COVID-is-a-hoax memes FB called it. got really mad, ""laugh"" reacted posts, keep saying bullshit over-and-over agin, called antifa protester (?), said ""triggeredddddddd"" me, refused mountain evidence piled real life.

I blocked cut life. Fucking sad, refuse okay anymore. still goes disc golf people. going get COVID kill mother. know it. trying talk kicking out, still.... unfortunately, certain type voter care nearly enough things like funding campaign person voting for. vote based simple talking points, almost never hold anyone currently office accountable shitty performance. I'm sorry sir refunds. turn store credit. Would like Arizona instead? sorry hear that. really hope little guy recovers quickly! Ridiculous. 3-5 days Melbourne Australia, cases started grow exponentially.

Spouse actually got test result 2 days, luckily came back negative liar. must aware difference, yet made statement contrary. exposes liar. awful, yet surprising. one first things thought got sent home school March; ‚ÄúI hope kids abusive homes alright...‚Äù
I‚Äôm sure victims bad right now, domestic, sexual, kids, spouses, elderly people. Everyone stuck escape, probably extended contact friends trusted adults. 
The world really sickening place. Agreed dude. Hi Spain. Im aware, dont care wont wear mask.  one first symptoms. plane mid march one people wearing mask, specifically n95 mask. many coughers plane. Four days later pink eye, sore throat low grade fever. plane NYC. suspect virus may entered eye want people treated stroke last time recognize him. So? many us waving away southern states Thelma Louise Covid 19 canyon. expecting here? economy recover cases spread? would rather kill constituents see vote Democratic? Maybe pandemic perfect 'neutron bomb' killing people leaving infrastructure untouched. superpowers working weapon like forever. southern governors working Putin? lie. wearing masks shops mandatory England? No, - Scotland. must aware this, therefore lying. Texas, doubt COVID whatever something similar matched neither flu (usually get bad cough sore throat) common colds (high fever, body aches), gotten xrays ground glass even pneumonia. couple months later would sworn COVID based people describe COVID even worse had. Following US pandemic like best reality show ever. cares sub thinks? want it, Someone finally told Trump it‚Äôs easier lie teeth mask on. agree German politicians (especially smaller regional ones, like mayors state leaders) done great job. annoyed people reddit think Merkel main corona-manager, fact really prominent role handling crisis. really play big role deciding measures leading, mostly State ""goveners"". International media ignores completely name recognition thus generate interest international readers. OP, think concept begin day set number spoons (ie. energy) ration day. Don‚Äôt use spoons 10am, example. That's all? fun CIA Stop pointing facts! Would easier list symptom COVID now? maybe start teaching right thing stop spreading disinformation bad internet troll true - example, face masks mandatory shops Scotland mandatory England. So, hoax anymore douche? college kids indoor classroom, frat party, late night bar close-contact sports

yeah, virus explode college towns soon know virus made china threat us? potus punish action.

/s sure Yep, restricted Spain. Nobody allowed outside health district. So, case, nearest hospital services area 175,000 people. border, travel outside area, got $600 fine. That‚Äôs Mickey Mouse bvllshit right there. Oregon &amp; Washington &amp; Hawaii too? mask wearing test made doctors say great was. Post viral illness known thing often attributed ME/CFS/POTS don‚Äôt receive much mainstream attention research. wonder change. 

My theory post-viral illness ME/CFS/POTS auto-immune spectrum. correlates majority sufferers female groups.

I think immune system responds particular virus gets confused never ramps immune activity. shame took long realize this, blood hundreds thousands Americans hands. Sure, large (I hope) percentage population taking reasonable measures. think stretch daily records burn virus runs everyone refuses wear mask take precautions, ""easy targets"" virus. Then, numbers slow starts hitting people wearing mask avoiding restaurants etc. 
This I'm hoping anyway. kids kids can‚Äôt control, besides parenting controlling kids it‚Äôs teaching right thing Insanity I've read anecdotal data 20-30% people wearing masks nose out. see every time go store without fail. often cashier's standing directly across every customer. Britain lol, sure UK countries Scotland mandated mask wearing shops public transport. England done still seeing quite high number new cases deaths per day sadly. One thing dont understand people ask others seek permission? example ""should go gym"" question. fucking decide ffs... asking randoms internet... basically letting hive mind decide lol  New case records daily. offense, would grandma walk front car Trump would too? fault people idiots wearing mask. problem. narrow minded connect wearing mask political affiliation, problem. agree point, one CityMD Jackson heights. It‚Äôs much likely sick people going clinic get tested. 68% representative whole neighborhood, it‚Äôs representative people went one clinic there. wearing gloves everywhere since March myself. Touching door handles gas pumps certainly main reason so. Feels safer add extra protection layer. Though seems air transmission way way likely. horror movie, I'd find plot bit far fetched. observe reality... Fired, loss license unemployment. Florida right-to-work at-will state. Teachers strike state since 1968. literally law.

*It's second degree misdemeanor Pretty sure named storms listed season since 2005. Mask recommended along social distancing. Unless 6 feet apart person ""open outdoor space"", mask on. really phenomenal data analysis. leading candidate, Oxford vaccine, set trials Brazil South Africa. I'm sure South Africa doing, Brazil alone enough generate robust data. couple candidates planning run trials USA timelines way behind Oxford. Looks like case follow leader whatever stupid say day instead scientists... wonder leader would face class action lawsuit telling people drugs miracle cures scientific background love Bill Gates thing. literally said stuff virologists talk about, expecting, every single day. 2+2=5, fucking idiots! Knowing us, we'll write future textbooks ignore this. 

We ignored slavery race, think sweep Trump rug? Meanwhile Michigan governor toughened mask mandate. Beginning Monday businesses must deny entry/service anyone wearing mask. Individuals subject $500 fine businesses lose operating license (forced temporarily close) and/or liquor license found compliance. 

Immediately yesterday notice uptick mask usage local grocery store Upper Michigan. I‚Äôd say 99% compliance, though spot couple people wearing properly (below nose). 

So happy live state governor cares people Michigan acts based science data. stay away Michigan, Ohioans. Fuck maskless people, understood NOTHING. ""Badly""

Thank attending presentation. allegations would carry lot weight sourced BBC said got information deaths ( lack of).

Blindly believing stuff written interwebs 21st centuries ‚Äústranger danger‚Äù PSA. got goods them? Link it. Problem hits many states time there‚Äôs nearly enough military medical personnel help them. can‚Äôt double entire healthcare system south overnight think it. Despite deaths, majority white America loves leadership: thus making clear value hate racism even lives. Think posted second.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll give hint: moment time, exactly 50% human population average intelligence. shame President child admit words wrong. Instead he'll wear mask pretend none nonsense ever happened. There'll apology, either. talk masks useless caused deaths never apologise likely pretend *always* said masks good. people start wearing now, lot people continue refuse say things like ""he's wearing appease Dems"". didn‚Äôt Sweden well üòÇ But...but....the man Fox News says it‚Äôs protestors Mexicans‚Äô fault surging!! Don‚Äôt even try argue republicans, based opinions science reason wouldn‚Äôt republicans first place *less 8633 people tested though since they're including retests 6 months quarantine next week me. I'm fucking losing it. Btw can't look name without chode flashback facepalm heard ‚Äòround world I'm Florida know feel. best take care now, that's do. :/ corrupt. too. Painful right? Still going reserve sympathy people actually victims, people chose listen buddies' facebook feeds experts. made subject disinformation campaigns yet us behave recklessly. think trump actually really good America, apart accusations. weeks day now, gotta believe millionaires billionaires believes I. Trump months ago assassinated vice president Iran? Yeah, masks filter smoke, toxins. taking falling polls numbers raising covid-19 death numbers serious?  wow, goes history Even true, isn't, motor vehicle deaths contagious idiot. Ah, no, Aunty Helen, suffer fools gladly, think corrupt bone body... Meanwhile Michigan governor toughened mask mandate. Beginning Monday businesses must deny entry/service anyone wearing mask. Individuals subject $500 fine businesses lose operating license (forced temporarily close) and/or liquor license found compliance. 

Immediately yesterday notice uptick mask usage local grocery store Upper Michigan. I‚Äôd say 99% compliance, though spot couple people wearing properly (below nose). 

So happy live state governor cares people Michigan acts based science data. stay away Michigan, Wisconsinites. Well, I'm British I'm pretty sure I'll allowed mainland either way. Also:

""Trump makes everything look cool &amp; badass. Everyone else looks like sheep dumb masks""

""He's patients... rocks mask like other.""

I'm even American get angrier angrier day comes Trump supporters. aren‚Äôt even 1,5million people dead worldwide ? understand sarcasm? Yes is. Lots cities faster traffic flow cops stop people. Ever Atlanta? I-75 though city everyone going 100 faster. CIA wanted rid Trump create hoax ... they'd drive past book depository grassy knoll two.. Exactly. That's end zombie apocalypse. 10 months infection virus reactivates settles brain causing rabid hunger. friend's uncle's dog's second cousin's hairdresser's accountant knew someone died, even coronavirus still put covid-19 death certificate. numbers bullshit. Wait lol, say that? He‚Äôll ‚ÄòEpsteined‚Äô he‚Äôs careful. would surprised. whole lot people dead right would still alive. 

This sums every republican presidential administration. imagine trump many Americans would alive? Bush won? Well transmission highest enclosed spaces sustained time, ie sat near someone train. Briefly passing street moving past someone Tesco much lower rate transmission. 

Don‚Äôt get wrong, support wearing masks indoor spaces, can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd keen idea mandatory masks open outdoor spaces. Especially incidences virus much lower England places. Florida here. found huge variations time get tested, results, cost. experience:

Health Dept - Free, one week schedule testing, another 5-7 days results. test here.

University Florida medical system - ins copay (155 me, 0 parents) day drive through, 24 hour results. Need doctor refers get tested.

Quick Care #1 - 24-48 hours testing, pocket, 5-7 days results.

Quick Care #2 - day drive testing, 3 day results

10 family members tested, 5 initial positive, 2 obviously also tested negative. One two tested positive.

One hospitalization, 9 month old baby, currently hospitalized. 

Source preschool, brought home toddler completely asymptomatic. 9 month old asymptomatic MIS-C symptoms began 3 days ago.

Edit: spelling Killing poor ppl wouldn‚Äôt something they‚Äôd imho. Well, anymore Make American Graveyards I‚Äôd hate think idiots would react similar argument topless women public. freedoms! Right now, yes, attitudes coming defiant states slowly starting change. president finally wore mask yesterday. think starting get idea something concerned about. Ya, know raised 70% Mormon town. trying make light comment sounded dickish sitting bottom downvoted. Kinda misleading title ""The province statement Thursday sought calm fears, saying ‚Äúdoes million already open dug graves‚Äù number refers potential capacity"".

By ""***prepares 1.5 million gravesites""*** really means spot land could potentially put many graves on. lol seen mom always talks shit parents, raining parents covered baby/child dressed like summer Well, that's fucking ominous‚Ä¶ wholly understand. Three times week wife goes treatment lymphoma. Seeing willfully ignorant terrifies me.

Three times week I'm waiting outside parking lot. Three times week empty bottle Lysol car. Three times week son can't see mommy next day. 

Three times week can't room wife. Three times week, I'm missing best friend. Three times week, wife, better half, reason breathe, can't see little man.

Why respectful treat people properly trying convince covid-1984 real?  ‚ÄúItS RiSkS‚Äù Common cold virus mutates faster. It‚Äôs misleading. agree it‚Äôs dumpster fire, areas dumpster fires ‚Äúonly 1%‚Äù post implies. areas extremely high rate infection. 

I‚Äôm NYC bad. 22% city tested positive April (from random sample people). April, can‚Äôt imagine percentage caught point. It‚Äôs ‚Äújust 1%‚Äù.

It‚Äôs much useful look things state level. Even useful county level.  nothing race. everything logical consitency comes judging people ideas actions.

If one party something reccomended dies, people celebrate that, another party also something reccomended (gathering together large groups), people also need celebrate latter party dies... fair?

Another option celebrate innocent person's death. stupid thing say purposely listening putting life direct danger something simple face covering. sounds really abusive, put lightly.  Hydroxychloroquine

Just FYI case know, whole narrative shit show. research using COVID stopped lancet published paper discrediting it. Turns research behind paper dubious best may help. Strangely Japan mono considered common childhood illness. Almost everyone gets preschool, symptoms mild nonexistent. would say remove one political party boomers entire problem disappears. Herd immunity impossible achieve. need 60 - 70%. Even ""only"" 1% infected die, body count would disastrous.

Then longtime effects infection still unclear potentially serious.

It's unclear long immunity infection lasts. Might anything couple months 2 - 3 years.

The list goes on. ever still routes herd immunity moron.

We need sit tight vaccine ready. way. Doctor said heart firing 120bpm despite felt pulse like 70, cardiologist getting beta blocker. would imagine needed pacemaker would come already.

Fuck world actually news! Let say quiet part loud:

The uneducated boomers allowed explicit, precise thing destroyed Facebook. Back elitist boomers getting unless loaded professor, almost none current things people hate platform would there.

The Fox News audience single-handedly killed platform, wall keeping never come down. Meanwhile Michigan governor toughened mask mandate.

Yeah, chronic anemia (even iron supplements iron-rich diet) getting day constant feeling exhaustion torture. literally wake set timer 2-3 hours eat snack take something try wake reset alarm again, amount sleep ever feel truly rested.

Just tired, always tired. Imagine that,his pollsters discover metric shit ton supporters ventilators cannot go wait line vote. changes tune favor voting mail,but then,it's late............... happy parents option educator tell happy this. Many us expected teach person online school time salary. addition exposed virus getting handed higher workload .

It's actually pretty horrible educator. bad us, eventually gonna bad students. run down.  actually well Sweden, official numbers, 

(excel spreadsheet)

And comparison **Coronavirus 2020: 5,515 deaths** far.

**Total deaths 2019 Sweden, 88,822.** 

**Influenza: 290 deaths.**

**All respiratory respiratory diseases, 6,154 deaths.**

This relevant section spreadsheet, hard make even though Swedish, 

Kv = Woman, = Man

Section 51. respiratory 52. Influenza. 

I heard US types Pnemonia lung diseases often get classified flu maybe would better comparison, Man spot satire. lol  137k going strong.. believe first time photographed wearing mask. months ago circlejerk /r/pics ""he want seen wearing mask, is"" something drivelled sort That's bullshit. mask, hard it. blindly right think people can't wear properly ridiculous.  Yup. estimates catch 1 10. we're talking 30 million infections 51k deaths... bad. Considering typical flue season what, 3-4 months? quarantine. PCR test arrival. need PCR flying here. waltz in. problem. 

Probably summer gonna huge spike cases. summer cases get control another series lockdowns.  us Americans absolutely horrible, selfish people. unfortunate thing people catch virus. really care ideals stubborn attitudes. GOP 10 July 2020: LIVE LAND FREE! WEAR MASK! VIOLATION CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS! COVID HOAX! PRESIDENT!

Nice Disney doesn‚Äôt give shit lives lol Twitter account already acts like bot, could easily deep fake him.

Nevermind Florida seems winning race right nowhere near border.... whole Navajo Nation aspect.

Someone throws mask suddenly spread due minorities..... Disneyworld reopening. Got it.

Nothing works well position. like Welp goes hope people learn someone close suffered.
Im sorry America guys fucked. Um..no one said going back 2000+ cases day - they'd go up. did. Definitely right time ""I told so."" Chill mate. Reddit 90% American. 42% Americans passports. forgiven thinking mostly USA. I'd forgive inferiority complex (if one) generally complete tosser (if one). Finally! probably better chances re-election got scared. wear one month ago [May mask everything. even joked rally showed off. article message shared. another article said primary mode transmission airborne getting infected surfaces seems primary mode... although potentially possible.. may paraphrase memory.

 I'm still washing groceries sanitizing heck hands go places help relax little bit know likely primary mode transmission. 

 agree still good reason err side caution. know that, thanks  think, took 137,000 lives. trump needs arrested thank you, wish people corrected mistakes non-native speakers like could stop making  admin full people skilled manipulation.

Unfortunately they're evil shits like him. mean? think that? prefer 100 Floors Frights Symptoms include limited to; 

Fatigue, post exertional malaise, non refreshing sleep, brain fog, muscle joint pain weakness, sore throat, swollen glands, nausea.

Symptoms range severity result people bedbound- even transferring wheelchair becomes impossible.

While current treatments provide small relief symptoms people, known cure. people reported recovering symptoms however reports relatively few. many people lifelong, disabling condition. make immune covid mutations? Thats beauty conversation. take comment face value find starting great big monologue doesnt produce conversation. seriously expect supremely narcissistic moron taking brilliant educated person's scientific advice heart? kind music? Singing associated number super-spreader events, possibly deep inhalation projecting voice lead extra droplets exchange. would say 4-6 feet apart may enough vocal band, move outdoors least, string instruments ok. Please careful. That's kind point. time hits hundred day area grown control continue spiral. Seriously. best one thing: meddling people‚Äôs business.  find sad politicians people smart day beach would **not problem all**. rules would be:

* go people living together
* Keep distance others
* Maximum number people beach limited entrance somehow
* additional safety, everybody would bring Corona tracing app tend kill fan base pig fuck needs permanent muzzle. Yep lied. exaggerated. misled. 

Dont care though. Scotland country Id much happier border us. That's bullshit, every generation. I've seen mentality across board. Humans naturally inclined go instant gratification self absorbed. Society kinda nurtured us curb traits favor logic, America also freedom want culture. seeing results combination explanation sounds way better first comment. Seems like ok. Good luck. said before, good businessman would making millions MAGA masks sell, could avoided whole lot hassle disease supporters would rushed buy mean.. this: appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* rolling average deaths much lower 140. Yesterday's figure bit anomoly lot backdating added, daily deaths still going down.

Even yesterday's increased numbers, average still 86. Previously 70s heading towards sub-50 day. Apparently not. math experts. 

Don't get mad me, I'm messenger. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è somewhere particular read behavior time? article saw BBC indeed say never masks believe time place,"" said left White House.   Saturday said: ""I think hospital, especially particular setting, talking lot soldiers people that, cases, got operating tables, think great thing wear mask.""   Speaking Fox Business Network last week, Mr Trump said: ""I'm masks."" new soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend sounds like Atlanta hot spot mayor also tested positive. passengers plane hot spot subject mandatory quarantine, get imported cases soon clusters community spread 2 weeks.  Yes tell there's systems place enforce practical way, barely social safety net ensure people able get time work. Wow, sounds really crazy. live Germany *everyone* wears mask here. even get berated (by customers cashiers) stand close together supermarket check everyone needs cart limit number customers limiting number carts. looks like deep connection China. someone living shitty place without freedom, say guys know freedom. History books year fun... would definitely bored history 2020 content real Nobody likes rat. ""I've always said masks great, I've probably said good masks anyone, ever"" Trump tomorrow, probably. Republicans districts. live 20-30 flow traffic. Scotland wee krankie posturing following Tories days later following Tories.

That true - example, masks mandatory shops Scotland England. 2m rule relaxed England 26th June. Scotland 2 weeks later, still 2m rule sign relaxed. 

You must aware statement true. Therefore deliberately made false statement - (in case aware) definition lying. Omg it‚Äôs fucking immortan joe Eminem's rap? daily numbers everyone encouraged get back normal, I'd concerned next couple months. think that's fair. easy judge others hindsight, even easier ignore everything going time. decisions made *very* different set circumstances. media ""experts"" bleating Hillary lose, nobody could guessed we'd faced global pandemic even could somehow known, one could reasonably anticipated disaster trump administration would be. Trump spent *years* office I'm still surprised appalled actions, behavior, failures regular basis. also ignores real problems DNC caused feel supporting would immoral dangerous. 

The true test upcoming election we've got plenty evidence show severe costs (measured human lives) sit one vote conscience. depressing harmful democracy is, least time, think we've got settle lesser two evils. Imagine April would given speech said something like ""Here professionals, doctors, scientists. tell wearing masks protect virus. going listen them. (Puts mask.) See cover nose mouth? big deal all, thanks listening."" finally found boundary respected...I care details, I'll take it. people said country run businessman ! poor followers brain though, gonna hard wear mask cold 7-day moving average daily deaths UK 86, peak average 946.

 curiosity, republican democratic president back then? Well atleast fun public pool one. last. time. Sweden bragging, topic started norwegian newspaper. Bruh cringe Here's primary source people talking regarding recommendations re-opening American Academy Pediatrics: problem schools budget, resources, staff, desks, computers, time, etc. implement safety measures required open schools safely.

Basically AAP saying ""We open schools, safely."" reality cannot safely right now. temperature checks every school entrance. social distancing. contact tracing, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. wouldn‚Äôt known without comment, based info provided risk infection, kind clickbaity article heading hate. title could easily surprisingly low odds infection airplane (1/4300 surprisingly low me) instead made ‚Äúdoubling‚Äù risk, tbh got click. 

The virus terrible journalistic integrity matters, cries ‚Äúfake news‚Äù right helped sensationalized titles. know particular title isn‚Äôt sensational per se, I‚Äôm talking media general title definitely bit misleading given content MIT study. article released (whats 12/7/2020) aow many test done compaired positive test day weere tests done? testing results get. guess? delusion continues. deep state getting knowing much. They‚Äôre going throw back van he‚Äôll never see again. think ever really click goes court system, pay ticket large fee, dropped back regular life- earth shattering discoveries, execution defying America Corporation. It‚Äôll regular old Wednesday. see get it. surprised.

I try show simple manner, understand.

Lets say daily cases went like this:

45, 47, 50, 52, 55, 57, 60, 56, 50, 30, 20, 12, 10, 8, 6, 6, 5

If publish data like this, hard convince people still good reason stay home. threat seems small individual POV to. society, wise thing still lockdown.

So instead, add last 7 days up, like this:

20, 12, 10, 8, 6, 6, 5

But like this: 

**67**

So string look like this:

45, 47, 50, 52, 55, 57, 60, 56, 50, 30, 67

See? Simple stuff. People stay home, data correct, politicians say reported cases sunday. Everyone happy. Except brits course. maaaaaad! pessimist thinks they're screwing numbers. Report higher cases sunday markets closed report lower numbers monday/tuesday make markets rally thinking cases going down. Florida Florida businesses get revenue tourism. people dying left right tourism decreases, state dead water. want make people believe, get virus, loved ones safe. want keep money coming cost. really. Neighbor covid nurse. said shut one temporary floors things stabilized elective surgery patients leave. also got called work one day last week much staff. add /s effectively 0 contact tracing. going get much worse gets better.  worthwhile investment sure guess didn‚Äôt take account NHS‚Äô involvement vaccine US never sure, especially half quarter population saying won‚Äôt take it. Based number excess deaths baseline, actual number COVID-19 deaths US probably 30% higher official figures

That seem outrageously high. support assertion? That's closing 100,000 uncounted dead! nurse local hospital Detroit told hospital *over* counting COVID deaths, financial recent scientific estimates number

It's sad, frankly feel like trust numbers come places. I've seen *way* much misinformation that's supposedly 'reputable' sources. Saying things like 'attending protests increase infections', 'tests indicating many people virus thought *bad* news.' Everybody agenda, everybody seems want 15 minutes internet fame making popular statement. sad, really... pandemic negative things country's belief 'science'. shown yet partisan 'scientists' be.

## Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 thought emerged bats, possibly via secondary host. Here, investigate relationship spike (S) glycoprotein SARS-CoV-2 protein closely related bat virus, RaTG13. determined cryo-EM structures RaTG13 furin-cleaved uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S; compared recently reported structures uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S. also biochemically characterized relative stabilities affinities SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Although overall structures human bat virus proteins similar, key differences properties, including stable precleavage form human 1,000-fold tighter binding SARS-CoV-2 human receptor. observations suggest cleavage furin-cleavage site decreases overall stability SARS-CoV-2 facilitates adoption open conformation required bind ACE2 receptor. shouldn‚Äôt saying nobody develops even partial immunity subsequent infections worse based 1 patient 

I see claims... quote portion article author says that? 77 days 3 Nov &amp; 20 Jan. That's lot time one last F world nut act. think completely fair nursing home problem. Obviously mistake allow Covid patients stay homes homes. However situation dire. hospitals completely full beds short supply mild cases elderly. states formed plan care quarantine wings care homes care homes meet requirements would patients transferred could. theory plan could worked, unfortunately shortfalls resources knowledge doomed plan. Many nursing homes PPE facilities properly isolate patients. know contagious virus protocols may insufficient. 

This could mitigated early testing resources nursing homes, sufficient PPE (they still it) better protocols. states share blame along Federal government seeing Nursing homes regulation administration federal government. Reddit become vile place comes Americans man. Particularly white Americans. It‚Äôs giant circle jerk. get it, shit fucked right now. it‚Äôs us. There‚Äôs actual good people majority, less vocal. 

Some posts Americans mean ignorant. sad thing is, don‚Äôt see us going positive direction anytime soon. election going bring worst sides. *snorts* place renewed lockdown due case rise, CM shown happily lie suppress journalism. 

Remember recent fake encounter? grass eating scandal? lies unemployment reducing rather rising? Surprise surprise! *stated heavy sarcasm* think conspiracy hide data, tests give lots false negatives (some tests 40%) doctors going say ""covid"" death certificate negative result. excess pneumonia deaths looking states?

Having said that, releasing excess deaths numbers part regular covid report too, conservatives Florida currently believe deaths *overcounted*, undercounted. Exactly! Scientists doctors urging people wear masks, based science. people get sick go? Oh, doctor course. trust doctors need help right away. definition **selfish**. im saying using 6' without looking context rediculous. People taking sort religion keep safe use justify unsafe practices. Yes, many cases effective. many more, specifically indoor little fresh(clean) air circulation, gimmick likely one major causes upticks cases (im looking indoor dining, reopened office spaces) Hun, bet get news Facebook. read studies articles. 

Yeah mental health bad faith argument comes pandemic response. solutions going Disney. 

I hoping better going Disney. can‚Äôt nice things dude. Seriously, listen epidemiologists, random Facebook rants. want participate ending thing sooner later, it‚Äôs big ask. tested negative flu March June. able breathe correctly night since March 10th. Yea I‚Äôm surprised increased rate coronavirus within military. see guard BLM protests? Absolutely NOBODY wore mask ones saw. protestors getting faces police line. 

It‚Äôs hard stay optimistic reading covid news. need SGN back John Krasinski. absolute shit show here. part problem: people travel populated hard-hit areas rural areas less populated ones disregarding fact could bring them. One American article says thinks virus overblown. He's going take seriously. 

As Canadian whose country shares border US, number one threat country. Many Americans refused quarantine come govt keeps letting in. talked American woman day said self-isolate came states, required give temperature airport, thinks wearing masks bullshit, etc. America one highest case counts, lack people understanding seriousness virus due politics misinformation.

Please Ireland, secure borders screwed. Slainte. mean, baked value Britain. founding fathers started revolution basis Parliament denying rights Englishmen, all. could say thing 3 months testing, year testing. Testing vaccines normally takes many years, time luxury afforded right now.  like nobody Disney world standards. People live streamed yesterday. stuff wait, walk rides. Though seemed locals annual pass makes sense Exactly. Florida needs, bunch fat people wandering around taking selfies Mickey Mouse. could possibly go wrong? Nothing 15,000 cases one day ""good"" news. 

I see trying say, though. friend might partially correct. hard find date death information entire state, but, example, Houston Health Department post date death daily posts, deaths reported recently May/June (see tweet: friend assuming means spike seeing caused backlog, that's case. Deaths take weeks months correctly categorize report, we're counting deaths happening today last month, we're currently counting deaths happened last month. takeaway least Houston, recent spike mostly data June, even begun count total deaths happening July Consultant? reporting many extra tests today seems. long true means, least looks like, cleared backlog kind. downside is, true, idea *when* test done. 50k extra test finished backlog none July...then test represent little relevant data maybe death rate look like. Well provided free NHS UK. assume something similar happen worldwide. Even think think governments (such US) driven personal interests, it‚Äôs still beneficial put end Covid basically metric. Even cynical perspective, it‚Äôs worthwhile investment. Oh, China 100 man party central sacked local officials took situation hand.

But seeing Texas, looking Arizona Florida... sacked Wuhan local officials maybe improvement them.

These fucktards pushing schools reopen height pandemic. can, wise move think 1 5 Americans nothing lose good idea. can‚Äôt argue science, even though people love try.

Anything else hold hand on?

Edited: even cleaned links you. source list project created spreadsheet external icons. ""So hill \*literally\* chosen die on?""

""Actually, Florida pretty flat"" looks like florida gonna test herd immunity. estimated based serology 7.9% active infections NYC, something like 50,000 day 14 days tried looking up? Cause describing exactly what's already happened. double checked that, changed since grew up. Even Idaho lot expensive was. I'm saying churches (of denomination) perfect; spending results highly correlated. 

That said, think agree education system elementary secondary level US well be. also feel lack education directly contributing severity pandemic. Motherfucker looks evil mask.

Makes sense it. 

Joe's made look secret servicey least. No, we're sick COVID -- trump know difference Imagine writing this... try changes someone's mind... yikes proves one thing. government failed us. could mandated factories produce testing kits. could taken number actions. 

They‚Äôre going let us die. 

Without proper testing, won‚Äôt even know bad is. worry. Disney world nba opens Florida escalate number. Hang tight! Make Florida Great Again. (Sarcasm) think I'm leaving mine week. Cook diner spiking hard Idaho, worth it. 

Worst case scenario I'm heavily debt months can't find anything else. debt alive. I'm arguing people cant transmit without showing symptoms. I'm arguing stupid report somebody wearing mask right 1% country infected (which shit ton). report somebody wearing mask 1% chance they're guilty spreading virus. legal ramifications something develops (which believe happen) harming 99% normal people nothing harmful. POINT REPORTING PEOPLE WEARING MASK PRESUMES THEYRE GUILTY SPREADING VIRUS ISNT TRUE. THEYRE LIKELY GUILTY FORGETTING MASK HOME. Credit u/oasar. stole it. high blood pressure, fuck sake. new cases deaths dropping Sweden? opened since start pandemic, finding fewer cases despite ramping testing. NHS pay it. comments saying asymptomatic transmission common presymptomatic?

People saying **both, taken together** cannot distinguished *at time transmission*, common. Helth Florida shooting herd immunity. looked New York decided they'd rather spike like flatten curve stay locked down. messed putting economy human lives let's pretend plan. plan someone tests positive semester? university plan close time someone positive, stay open keep soldiering on?

This whole thing seems unsustainable, especially Wisconsin‚Äôs rising numbers. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* still think Trump cares military tuned since 2015. I'm sorry successes crisis hurt feelings. can't right. add extra pneumonia deaths would mean like 1 10 people probably dying COVID. That... can't right? Mulan would definitely wear mask. Wuhan flooded right now? Bad time try investigation. I‚Äôm pretty surprised reopened, honest. initially closed, clear sign things getting pretty real. Maybe could see end sight decided, fuck it. left job start bullshit. Can't collect UI want die corporate bullshit protect workers? Fuuuuuuuck shit. I'm waiting real riots start shit flips america upside shakes change pockets. would legitimate burn-cities-down riots ""fuck vegetables, right subsist steak bacon"" crowd limited pounds meat per month. Stahhhhhhhhp wow, NY's positive rate got 50%.

jeeze see. appears ratfuckery going numbers.  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Best case eradicate 2022 China release purpose. Oh see. UK fines people breaking quarantine rules, China actual crime. Quick! Hide basement! people using hard coded delays cases deaths useless. testing result delays death certificate reviews. People NJ passing away results could even processed. top adding deaths occured June even earlier. Everyone go this. masks anything, cycle. Odd number similarities global leaders right It‚Äôs far likely got flu March honestly, bad flu season deniers tell anyone dying counted covid positive death though. exhausting Well idiotic thing pneumonia caused deterioration COVID causes, you‚Äôre covid positive die pneumonia think it‚Äôs pretty damn fair say died covid. ‚ÄúNo sir, didn‚Äôt die car crash, died severe hypovolemic shock happened car crash‚Äùü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è wonder likelihood he's wearing tested positive, confirmed potential vector infecting everyone around (other senior members government, meaning huge national security risk). look deeply it, Wikipedia article source particularly flattering. Neither spent lot time WhatsApp video chats! beats dying alone Covid. Flat line bad medicine India good positivity rating 7%.

UP, state question? 

19%. Yeah gave friend work, that's none business. government policy. Uh seen positive rate rising lately? understand still people accept this, many articles need upvote? 

Just opinion, feel like another ""doctor says politicians listen doctors/researchers"" really contribute anything new. Good thing is, grow lot stuff food buy. bell peppers seeds got one ate. piece garlic sprouted, garlic. last leek bought good roots, planted halfway new leek harvesting 2 weeks. started base fennel roots, got couple new bulbs growing top already. Yall realize people crap loads money stay home. Everyone makes money press forward. Guessing stringent restrictions scare business off, wealthy want do. understand it, agree reason. damaged credibility fueled conspiracy theorists. think better option would reach manufactures retailers ask voluntarily pull PPE shelves reserve healthcare industry. Walmart Amazon alone they'd secured vast majority nation's retail sector.  

I understand requires leadership federal level considering administration leveraged PPE enrich buddies pit states bidding wars I'll admit sensible option likely possible. entire counties sheriff's, cases judges, coming saying enforce mask mandate.

Ironic months ago cities counties wanted implement safeguards Governor said power that. Yeah, well lot protesting last month right. hide basement, let people get back work want. community thankful continue isolate precaution :) thank keeping around little bit safe! really missed opportunity. really feel democrats would fucked caught on. MAGA masks would rage racist little corner country finally required. something strengthened rehab / exercise? tough one deny it. cant deny benefits kids social. mental health (I talking 6 12). point though risk becomes much.. obvious household spending kids tested weekly test 24 max 38 hour result. family single case, relevant child kept home.

I answers... wish would share world. Would considered murder hugged CEO and/or boss show much family means me? likely poll numbers. r/BrandNewSentence god dang time! Hopefully followers same! ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è never happen, think would something I‚Äôd ignore unless obvious class knew focused it. Usually take care ‚Äúhow know said‚Äù shit classroom basically ask side teach, say English, say something like ‚Äúso, spend entire day working words they‚Äôre used, don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs good chance I‚Äôll know you‚Äôre talking about?‚Äù sometimes even ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nun‚Äù work. But, yeah....you can‚Äôt really win one. Kahoot :( Drumph hated Quarantine! whole Quarantine reason!Now, please ask why... though might treason.

It could head screwed right. could be, perhaps, tie tight.

But think likely reason all, May mask two sizes small. sent free one... scary part many deaths officially 1% Nope. problem several groups around globe ran studies hydroxychloroquine found provide adequate treatment covid harms patient, studies cut short. people like STILL THINK political, FACT I‚Äôve seen people wearing Trump Pence 2020 masks grocery store. sheer amount irony lack self-awareness wear something like mind boggling. Yeah, I've heard response awhile. Yet still wearing masks. Exactly. Disneyland Anaheim still closed CA allow theme parks open yet. Obviously Disney known money hungry mega Corp, surprised want get back game ASAP. Blame governor allowing open. boss Good. damn time. feel like pay close attention politics. Granted get frustrated try turn bit keep sanity. knew Trump proponent masks. However shocked realize first time worn mask public. mean f***! f***#$g serious? I‚Äôm embarrassed him. country get point best option leader? wouldn‚Äôt even support lead local PTA. He‚Äôs creep. liar. actually smart. Ugh. 2020 sucks. dunno system already place feel like gun owners need routine mental checks. Weren‚Äôt excerpts Bolton‚Äôs book confirmed Trump this? article didn‚Äôt really provide much information. Yes obesity leads worse corona outcome, haven‚Äôt seen convincing evidence weight loss intervention lower risk. effect obesity isn‚Äôt reversed weight loss it‚Äôs due damage co-morbidities obesity? genetic cofounder associated obesity poor covid outcome?

This question could answered comparing covid outcomes individuals significant weight loss. Gastric band gastric bypass surgery patients would good place start information medical record already.

I‚Äôm saying people shouldn‚Äôt lose weight. obviously good people, potential benefit. However also potential harms. individuals take less precautions lose good amount weight?  could really PR disaster even can't proven got Disney. story one ""Vacation Nightmare Stories"" shown Inside Edition. one story comes hell break loose. Yeah course! Here's Wikipedia article explains Google AMP pretty neutral idea behind AMP bad - helps mobile pages load faster. Google AMP comes bad side effects. Mainly, content creators end less ad revenue less control content. opinion piece sums well short wear mask water park. social distance water park? Fucking morons.

But again, else expect state 4 days ago recorded 10,000 NEW covid cases yet, still parks open.  Disney bubble bubble would want right now. Immunity necessarily imply *get* virus... means avoid severe symptoms virus. immunity kicks soon enough keep dying. fit political narrative ostracized. fact CFS affects women commonly can't help either. lot doctors pretty awful dismissing health complaints women. hope condition finally gets attention deserves. I've making custom masks people. seems incredibly key getting small children wear masks (and even better, excited them). honest, think helps adults too. mom enthused masks back March offered choice quilting patterns.

I've done puppy face, fabrics Disney princesses, Star Wars, Harry Potter, unicorns, BMW grill one kid who's cars (that one kinda looks like two black kidney bean shapes sewn on, tbh, one great things kid's imagination takes matter much sewing sucks). Two sets TMNT one bugs appliqu√©d table.  Hey rest world. please agree wall germs country years come? Please block reliable vaccine available 70s least. dad's older sister's husband rarely got see since left CA young. That's probably fraud money laundering, incompetence. üëÄ Saw one parents monthly grocery trip today. Mother, father wearing masks, kid wearing anything, literally running climbing things. Staff said bind refused even confront them. she‚Äôs right hope Sues Interesting. I'll keep mind place closer person front you? That's dear leader said something similar left Walter Reed. nothing masks, time place.  guys act verbatim truth ""link"". even stat given time-frame?  Michigan's Governor specifically recommended something like people reluctant. think specific suggestion wear mask says ""I hate masks,"" cuts right psychology issue. lets people wear masks without humiliating themselves, annoying would be, would save lives. reminds tweet guy said,

""You're telling 75 years ago, Julius Caesar invented bomb ass salad still holds today?!?"" That's completely unworkable. enforce it. truly universal would massive problems hospitals, food distribution, police, basic utilities, etc. shutting down. universal continues spread among essential workers reemerges reopen. matter what, unless small isolated country like Iceland New Zealand, never fully control risk spread places. im fine mask lie. know people would make run face masks leave hospitals without ppe.....like tp hand santizer Shit. Sorry hear that. Trump fired people EPA yadda yadda yadda. 

You're using excuses climate deniers. ""inaccurate data"", ""conspiracy"", ""prevented publishing *real* data"".

Or, keep denying it, show hypocrisy.

""Party science"" ass... need hang sign says 

""Don't wear mask"" mask dangling front.

That motherfucker hands time. Russian Bounties....still condemned Russia/Putin. show non-stop Fox News. Nah, trying get Kazakhstan admit covid. still put past delay saying wear mask enough peddle. little late man. Maybe seen mask public months ago, we'd people also wearing masks. It‚Äôs almost it‚Äôs global pandemic phone, already are! 

It‚Äôs kinda crazy they‚Äôre using what‚Äôs already there. Privacy already invaded - use save lives instead using personalized ads? little late dont think? I've wearing one since March. Exactly. took long drive Washington today. Never left vehicle really save rest stop two bathroom. needed long road trip cabin fever. Anyways gave mask mandate amazing see everyone actually wearing mask. crossing back shortish drive Idaho back Montana stopped another rest area. Saw 5 people wearing masks. 

I even saw two people hanging right front bathroom entrance. Literally making people exiting walk two feet front without makes. Zero social distancing. 

The thing saw strangest saw woman man walking towards bathroom noticed pregnant. I'm still car waiting crowd die said wife: "" know pregnant. wearing mask least protect child.""

At moment approached building pulled masks entered. Cool said.

Wrong. moment excited removed masks proceeded hang right building people walking right two feet. I'm like: ""what's freaking point mask shit?""

People freaking blow mind.

Stay safe family moved NYC/NJ january, TX. still working feelings, tbh. least Luke's father wearing mask. Same. narcolepsy can‚Äôt much eat lunch right without BS lawsuit try stop it. people needing removed office ones fighting him. Right! Ventilators would comfortable.  US, currently 9%. is, 9% cases longer active, inactive death. 91% recovered. told mask made Ivanka‚Äôs knickers We‚Äôve lost 130,000 people thing. Isn‚Äôt enough? wrong you? possibly defend failure president anymore? needed distract attention Roger Stone front page news. yeah tosser scientific knowledge face morons  Sucks. Breaking sweat working hard pandemic getting pay. really wish government would hook people like work healthcare aren‚Äôt specialized. Like free tuition would great Someone probably told pardon Roger Stone people would stop talking Putin's bounties. sounds like need new job. staple face make kids wear masks entire time Quarantine I‚Äôm gonna owe 600 presents, whose gonna pay presents, better get another stimulus check I‚Äôm gonna buy toys, gonna keep toys, whose gonna teach 2 1 year olds communicate make proper deal, I‚Äôm gonna need hire teacher too. I‚Äôm already busy enough know  Kroger forcing workers wear solid colored masks. let employees wear printed masks. flowers. smiley faces. say goes work uniform
 pandemic. People fucking dying companies act. Well sure, he's never gonna outright say ""I wrong"" give us satisfaction. Pretty sure kids moved CA back 1987 rarely saw after. Soon powerful leader! Selflessly wearing mask protect citizens. KAG!

And sadly, I'll take fucking idiots start get program. chances didn‚Äôt want anyone recognize him. high communities protests likely live multi-family housing, rely public transportation, work ""essential"" jobs put higher risk. area, outbreaks linked bars restaurants, so... issue humidity gravity.

You're trolling right? God please troll. [This presidential looks people shamelessly spew crap? literally mocked Biden wearing one. We‚Äôre #1? make America great again? Hehehehe genuinely funny. planning do? Enforce martial law? Like actually right ever helps sleep mate Yes, locking best way stop COVID deaths. 

Failing protest certainly nothing help unequal pay, unequal policing, biased justice system, intergenerational economic disadvantage slavery, sharecropping, redlining, white settlement acts, biased legislature seems illegalize Black drug use White drug use, white supremacism law enforcement, state intervention Black communities...

Justice can't put hold next years work whole COVID thing out. far I'm concerned there's one singular good reason gather large groups right now, defend community violence oppression protest, demonstration, otherwise. not!

All started minor workout, trying keep schedule - impossible days like yesterday. thing putting much effort &amp; money something silly prove point willing put health line ""libs"" stat trending, percentage wise, cases. cases get data. *Hospitalizations per case deaths per case trending down.* 

[Now factor potentially 10 times cases wait become concrete information. bad it'll 6 months still sitting home arguing ""necessary precaution"".

Math support argument, dude. scream blue face, flu season last year worse current situation factor 13.

Where mask then? keep thang dont wear walking dog either unless someone walking past unavoidable   LIBERATE MICHIGAN!! could like give single fuck people say think. dont know feel. tragedy.

Is tragedy perpetuator violent policy chooses policy purpose? point, tragedy, accomplishment, no? FAKE NEWS!?

I'm telling you, rich Americans killing poor Americans, broad day light sponsored government

viva la revolution Oh I‚Äôm sure ‚Äúnobody knows wearing masks Donald Trump ‚Äú agreed. blown away old were. tourists? People like blindly believe would accept vaccine heartbeat equally stupid antivaxxers. 100% side effects vaccine thats released, severe dont know. Eitherway risk. common sense limit amount people receive vaccines theres PROOF reinfections possible curve flattens priority groups receive it.

Also, speaking experience sibling received vaccine young age still dealing side effects till day. everything requires sarcastic stuck reply, ignoramus. RemindMe! 2 weeks! ""on sides"" - *a telltale sign tired lukewarm take* Ah, Covid-19 zombie apocalypse surface 2026 then! long enough get stringy, bits missing zombie 'look' need someone wipe butt shocking. I've construction work building utilized large scale mortuary preparation second wave. ridiculous government preparing second wave still advocating mask use, proven effective. government came said wear masks, public would comply. I've wearing masks shopping see people looking like I'm reacting Yeah wears one except knows cameras rolling. Proper context nearly always makes Trump look worse. Gun sales probably increased due said increased violence common sense Brits would still part EU. xD China, coronavirus longer makes front page news sites.

Concerns flooding, Poyang Lake water line exceeded 98-year historical value Wheres stupid boat? scientists put parameters needs met re-opening, drop cases increase testing capacity. absolutely refuse wait meet case drop parameters, least increase testing tracing capacities compensate. expect denouncement masks soon. He'll get sick wearing them, he'll talk shit, make another red meat gesture base, we'll worse before.

Every Single Time Trump made small step forward, immediately takes three steps back. Expect it. trials suceed flu season really kick schools? Covid flu going good time US. China, coronavirus longer makes front page news sites.

Concerns flooding, Poyang Lake water line exceeded 98-year historical value   Exactly happened California too. Exactly. He's insane wear one now.

Masks may work, may not. Thats issue.

The issue is, people applauding man's death also applaud death BLM protestor, death caused Covid caught protest? that's case, Britain new explosion C'est la vie
I'm sympathetic ones might infected along way must obligatory one person see wearing mask go Cambridge! Honest question - what's problem Rogan covid? tried googling seems laughed: ‚ÄòAll watch news every two weeks. I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúMask mask? Still mask? Alright, masks.‚Äù

I'm glad people recognizing is. 

I also think many people hard time understanding possible admire Fauci overall body work still upset play straight. ""You guys taking plague seriously. supposed scared even leave homes."" - Petulance probably many egos back alley deals politics around politicians. mess. truly remarkable complete outsider gets somewhere. thought sorta emded support staffs really can't, obvious now. Everyone worried life death...
Honestly kind life live walking one block makes wheeze? Starbucks want alienate dumb people. Walmart knows nobody cares local economy shopping unless choice, whatever want. ‚ÄúIt beautiful, I‚Äôll pardon you, you‚Äôll wear mask, I‚Äôll wear mask. one remember I‚Äôm piece shit, gave pardon someone convicted criminal lets face it, facing much smaller sentence someone without ‚Äòfriends‚Äô have.‚Äù Coronavirus much contagious 

The normal human coronaviruses quite contagious. SARS MERS not. Neither influenza, shown handle heat better lot viruses.

No, thing summer going UV rays

Higher absolute humidity, far leading explanation seasonality respiratory viruses. thank Christ Oh man America sure great right now! Let‚Äôs keep exactly is!/s That's said all.

I said they're unpredictable place serious burden governments.  Fauci straight said people use masks due PPE shortage.  transparent get go.  Part plan mitigation back making sure healthcare workers enough PPE would people treat covid19 cases.  solely decision made preserve public health.  even data back efficacy face coverings comparison conventional PPE course Fauci tell people need use surgical masks covering would work. Wow. Really? got tested Ontario. check ny results online free positive negative Mine too. believe it? Plenty people already that, except there's disheartening lack sarcasm compliments. IFR per CDC epidemiologists around 0.6%. multiply case count .006 understand roughly many deaths come day‚Äôs count. 

And even slight undercount aren‚Äôt catching every case rather ones someone worse off, rate higher - potentially 1-3% range. Prayers answered!!! drunk? say covid unfair different countries? I‚Äôm pointing countries use AC worse outbreaks countries air conditioning isn‚Äôt used much. Gulf countries especially, everyone uses AC time death rates lowest world (Oman, Bahrain ,Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia UAE). Maybe cure Trumpism... perhaps try it! already saying forced left. SMH I‚Äôve tasked handing free surgical masks customers come store (in FL,US) it‚Äôs amazing many followers think masks nothing Thank good know.

But long take reach herd immunity many people would die getting it, die due lack hospital space get herd immunity?

How many people might die, long term damage afterwards? would wager hospital refused let without one... Joe bunch fans anti mask. guy tries hard appear like intelligent human being...yikes. god...just let people live lives...you hold basement won‚Äôt bothered appreciate it. know many people think us highly, hard believe we're treated poorly entities employ us. 


It's hard watching ads corporate released since pandemic started. call us heroes tell people wonderful are, give us hazard pay top already paying us little, many us second jobs pick bunch extra shifts. times I've turned extra shift state mom day got surgery breast cancer already worked four five 12hr shifts row.

the mask picture ABSOLUTELY NOTHING except blowing breath back him

and yet sarcastic gloating internet actually got tested abdominal pain GI symptoms anything, I‚Äôve headaches since Sunday. came back negative two days ago.

Finally!! Recognition longterm effects many Covid-19! touches one aspect many lingering effects damage besides ME.  experience north London, mask wearing widespread go supermarket many people wear masks.

I think people following govt advice always proclaimed outdoor risk low indoors spaces lime supermarkets hotspots.

Shame seem Gove supporting mask wearing today. govt always behind curve. Again? Whoosa big boy?! Mr. Pwesident big boy! Serious [DDT Good energy going ad. Yeah, that's gonna age like milk. Currently Leeds IKEA type, 35% folks wearing mask, everyone social distancing everyone hand sanitising entrance. nobody told us wear mask - THAT'S problem. problem people trained deal hostile people. We'd need station cops every essential business enforce rules. ""Rick pre-existing conditions""

That picture says otherwise lol Sweden's strategy absolutely correct one, execution strategy poor, led elderly deaths referred to. countries saw large outbreaks nearing, essentially at, herd immunity. allow return normal life, opposed prevented large outbreaks occurring, live threat (if) vaccine developed. Police show crimes theory. really stop violence happening preventative way. Lots studies show violence linked lack opportunity beginning? *edit* Thanks replies, love gets downvoted even though it‚Äôs simple topic question. ridiculous. ridiculous people behaving mask begin every time I've doctor's least last 5 years asked wear mask waiting room cough. Wearing mask (especially medical facility) natural progression pandemic spreads way spreads rapidly. Hopefully right stuff. wrong, given context, depending look it.

I'm conflicted. know feel this. covid started posssesing people ? Haha. devout followers stunned. ""Wait, wahh??! thought need masks!"" Nope arrogant ignorant pig. exactly saying lying every day 20 years? english speaking world that's gone moronic sudden Honestly, comment means lot reassuring here. Thank you. think freshmen taking hardest resisting most. get it. first chance freedom face this. make resilient, want hear moment. stop?  American, who's face saving? country great (less 1000 cases 15 deaths). need propaganda lies pretend competent like loser Chinese, Russians, Iranians. Americans, flaws, least honest numbers - bad are.

It's shitty see Americans dumped bad numbers people hypocritically delusionally pretend even bigger real failures (China, Russia Iran) failures full believe every piece propaganda totalitarian, genocidal regimes. 


I critical Americans general least lie pretend worse China Russia, know death / case numbers orders magnitude higher reporting. There's overal economy unfortunately people need go work. better safety nets would different people can't pay house food Bingo! Numbers excess deaths puts Belgium lower several others though.

As said, rather overestimated underestimated. Nero wheel. Read article ago comparing us Chinese empire late 19 th century  Tons US politicians literally fearing death know could theory actually happen enforcing masks. distaste strong. I'm laughing  spent much time making manly thing wear masks. hate fat orange bag shit. don‚Äôt want defiant law use face pain excuse wearing mask, don‚Äôt think people would believe me. feel like stores would let without mask, I‚Äôd rather follow rules draw attention myself. I‚Äôve seen one two people public face shield, think it‚Äôs great idea, don‚Äôt want judged others That's bit harsh. roaming patrols batons beat anyone without mask. People start complying. ""Such careful measures"" losing FOUR one week????? Navarro grifter Mass murderers families too. still wish good riddance. know wasn‚Äôt created lab, don‚Äôt know experimented lab.

Edit: lab houses worlds largest collection coronaviruses. Im saying source, would want go lab rule out. Whoa hold on?

By making education worse - religion bound teaching fucking creationism- raise generations non-critical populace believe anything tell them. it‚Äôs circle incredibly hard break. auto mod merely tool told do. responsibility run tool.  Yeah, speed limits cause speeding. Plenty places 'eroded judeo-christian' values fine. fact, sectarian countries seem much better monotheistic countries general. USA seems forgotten responsibility aspect called freedoms. Can‚Äôt, there‚Äôs bills paid fair concern, researchers estimate IFR always try account many factors possible give accurate estimate, including unresolved infections, untested COVID-19 deaths counted confirmed probable COVID deaths, well confirmed COVID-19 deaths caused COVID.

I'm sure mean 'number closed cases', find accurate IFR number estimated number overall infections outcome. He‚Äôs done research he‚Äôs bestiest mostest mask wearer history universe. fact feels bit sorry others good. joking; never feels sorrow. Population control. Maybe success. doubt throw parades celebrate either.  Facts statistics rarely overrule beliefs founded emotions. One must appeal emotions change minds. Show videos full ICUs, funerals, articles like showing doubters regretting past decisions. agreement salty people celebrating guys death it‚Äôs gross dont celebrate anyone‚Äôs death We‚Äôve quarantined since March 16th cases literally growing. hate here. I‚Äôd rather hide 5 years live US Maybe exist common cold. Maybe form immunity corona viruses cause common cold. 

Maybe they‚Äôd much worse didn‚Äôt immunity. 

Perhaps that‚Äôs we‚Äôre seeing now. new common cold circle world forever basically nothing people contract we‚Äôve built immunity.  post exactly accuse trolls doing... Face saving. need Italian mayors.  Lots beds.

Just doctors meds. realize people need America?  Texas already severe nursing shortage hit us hard. sleepy little town 100 miles away city ICU, ER, corona wing full. nurses running twice normal patient load they're high acuity. even enough nurses normal conditions we're running places divert patients to. past week went bad, manageable total crisis mode can't sustain this. Again, shutdown handle push hard, push back harder.

Stubborn idiots tend dig prove point.  Especially considering TON military medical infrastructure already south seeing CoVID19 patients hospitals. It‚Äôs going suddenly make selfish stubborn people give ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù want. White? Noteworthy amply demonstrated Teachers also go work unless symptoms positive test. fail shutdowns 

Why ""trump like"" way talking caught on? much ""I feel argument good, call failed still convince people.""  ""you guys""?

So typically American. stupid, incompetent, arrogant, off-putting convince anyone listen you, *even / right,* first thing turn threats violence. Honestly, pathetic. country fire. makes sense.

Flu:¬†The World Health Organization estimates that¬†290,000 650,000 people die flu-related causes¬†every year worldwide.

Your definition marginally opposite mine. Yea like leave door look look look never find them. mean obviously eventually find them, I‚Äôm sure spent much time looking masks Ohio would find wouldn‚Äôt easy isn‚Äôt reflection Americans unfair treat Hahaha thought gulf California got tip Arizona. Well played. realize low percentage kids hit harder then? think america even reach second wave first never stop. fuckin mega boner rangers Pretty sure don‚Äôt stick dick hairdresser. obviously doesnt work way. Also plenty old folks here.

Source: old Dr. Ioannidis. Nobody's god. He's intelligent relative type person listens podcast.  like countries went lockdown wothout economical damage. Yup. Im one whining able lol....plus dont need pay Texas thousand excess pneumonia deaths year mostly occurred traditional end flu season. 

 Also, state dashboard stats hides information numbers match local county numbers. county says 800+ active cases, state shows 600.  boards main page focuses simply total tests. No. Risk infection definitely higher closed spaces. mean there's magically risk outdoors. Social distancing everywhere. Melbourne people give shit despite current position. People can't wear masks. want flying cars you? flag good news? context provided title article. Obviously I‚Äôm talking recent spikes country first weeks lockdown, barely saw 1-2 people bus. fact, surprised running empty. Also city reduced routes/times weeks. seems oddly specific... number come from? Narrator:

""He did"" 6,500 returning overseas EVERY WEEK since late February - presume know goes Australia! made source book wrote well. RIP Cases still falling less 2 weeks since pubs/shops started opening. Also, lack masks may factor contributed slow fall cases compared counties. look data, cases places like Germany fell sharply lockdown, us, looks like platue. little late. f*ing kidding me?!?
When going quit playing politics, actually save people?!?!?? show us done then. saves economy too.

short harsh lockdown squash virus cluster &lt;100-1000 cases. Reopening without many restriction. \* &amp; keep border close rest world shit Ohio. county Ohio. One. 88.  mean, different getting haircut. exchange saliva fine.

Germany ain't Florida either, many infections. Universal Orlando open month already. I'll attach mine pull asshole realize fuckloads hospitalized even died, especially early NY AZ, never tested never tested. fog lack data cuts ways, dumb fuck. opened see graph, took couple weeks action took effect

Except there's literally evidence actions effect, commented.

Literally every single country Rt falling long measures announced. happened hard hit countries like UK, also happened mildly hit countries like Germany. Clearly people take responsibility others well enough.

 population look would lockdown needed? Day 130 here, dealing lingering fatigue, scared exercise again. Hang persistent doctors. 

You crazy, alone. many us quality life altered infected. So, 3 year old child never caught common cold, immunologically naive community met common cold, could super high risk?

The implication we're exposed common cold viruses low doses herd highly immune?

But genetically, prior inoculum, we're pretty vulnerable?

Or common colds bad times like Sickness Anglo-Saxon period ever killed people majority got T-cell herd immunity ""it kills old people"" etc?

I mean, virus new spreads slowly unevenly certain things immune system seen really crazy viruses (high affinity ACE2, locked unlocked binding positions, MHC-). Maybe still spreading certainly kill 5% end, permanently injure another 10%.

Why never one possibilities many people. assume killed *yet* won't? killed, environments bad... Leaving aside fact comparing lives way particularly sound strategy public health, numbers still add up. ""Years lost"" coronavirus occurred 4 months. Multiplying arbitrary number 3 puts several hundred thousand ""years lost"" per year higher motor vehicle accident number. maybe lack ability look long-term planning. keep going much longer economic damage catastrophic compared decent lockdown start virus. area masks public transport looks closer 5%. even drivers bother It‚Äôs slightly extreme view considering kids college age hardly chance dieng covid it‚Äôs essentially hardly anymore dangerous flu 18-29 demographic(according CDC). concerned kids affecting grandma that‚Äôs different story concerned kid contracting covid regular flu. specifically referencing 18-29 age group citing cdc death rate age. I'm shock shock. EU already went curve disease run course. Arizona's much earlier curve, curve started flatter therefore stretch longer.

I'm surprised devoid context scientific thinking people here. just: number bigger number... scary!!!! Absolutely thought given comparison even makes sense.

The number elephants zoos worldwide number ducks backyard pond! number ants South Africa number craters Mars!! I'M SHOCKED COMPARISON NUMBERS!!!! SHOCKING!!! H C K N G !!!

I like idiot brigade responsible constantly cooking stupid hysteria number comparisons context immediately addressed point all, somehow tried imply live Russia China... apparently make sense, guess much sick addiction cooking ignorant faux hysteria. leader gloated shaking hands people hospital COVID patients said we'd happy know he'd continue shake hands (He caught COVID ended ventilator)

He also looks lot like trump minus orange face paint  Forever Nope, Nightingale hospitals set weeks specifically treat Covid-19 patients actually never ended treating single person. 2017 New York practicing ""proactive"" policing, crime dropped. effective either technique execution, rendering pretty much useless micro-ship? ;) lockdown really brutal lockdown lite. Trump Regime would rather let people die respond needed Arizona ""Dem state"". Everything Trump considered news. Since one IQ tests scenario assume IQ used colloquially stand metric intelligence. Working memory accepted metric intelligence. pedantic incorrect.  ""Wonderfull experiment"" historicall quote doctor Mengele. Hot take all, idea aware this, control people do, I'm interested killing it. Uhhhh vets rep 

Don‚Äôt fucking generalize us. wasn‚Äôt rep joined sure hell after. know dem vets rep. Edited OG comment, quite honestly arguing Americans becoming tiring, since really taught whole ""with us us"" mentality Masks don‚Äôt replace social isolation. Depending study read, masks community settings, opposed clinical settings, effectiveness varies 6 33 percent effective.

According info graphic, masks 1/3 effective http://www.healthdata.org/infographic/covid19-mask-usage-meta-analysis

A meta-analysis around 2cluster-RCTs, cohort studies, case- control, cross-sectional (the rigorous type studies mask usage general public) conducted community settings concluded wearing face mask slightly reduces
the odds infection wearer around 6%

I note meta-analysis peer reviewed yet studies involved meta-analysis doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt wear one. Even 6 percent would slow spread considerably. doesn‚Äôt mean let guard down. Someone still get go wearing masks. People think like countries like Denmark don‚Äôt recommend mask usage general public except certain situations proper clinical mask protocol isn‚Äôt practical followed situation, recommend shields instead fewer ways misuse them. young people statistically going fine though. know everyone treats like job instill fear panic possible, OP already it. need scare him/her anymore, tell truth 20 99 percent chance fine. He's complying CDC guidelines. He's tested multiple times. zero evidence connection Trump wearing mask people dying COVID. Actually, that‚Äôs reason enacted fines. kinda liked it. flew house love military planes lol. Come back Sweden compare East Asian. try stay politically moderate. point, becoming fucking ridiculous. left misogyny. didn‚Äôt even know Germany brothels. 200 means written least 200 papers referenced least 200 papers. Since unfortunately papers disappear oblivion publishing amazing. one first wear one. Everyone saying ""I need mask"". wore one. wore one. went store recently every person wearing mask mouth only. saw 10 people 10 minutes there, hell lot people throughout day. able report every person would like least reported business. find way stay open proper compliance close down. trying say, thank you. 

I recently watched documentary evolution New York accent Pat Cooper told story teacher telling work better diction. 

He said ‚Äú...what matter speak invented something saved world?‚Äù It‚Äôs great documentary, Knishes Could Talk. It‚Äôs Prime, also think YouTube.

Also, say ‚ÄúLighten up, Francis,‚Äù 13 year old son gets wound something. Lol TIL learned reddit it‚Äôs called freedumb Well one examples edited make point honest makes seem much rational. Take full quote used first example.

""And way, virus. ‚Ä¶ looks like April, know theory, gets little warmer, miraculously goes away ‚Äî hope that‚Äôs true.""

Why include HOPE THATS TRUE part? clarify admits one time k would happen, hoped like many respiratory virus would seasonal like many others are? religious people hate science, fact, many love it. personally know many people country, England, America, Christians, Muslims, Sikhs, etc, enamoured science, want dedicate lives studying it. study religion philosophy, understand people coming from, especially Evangelicals religious extremists, religion science other? all, people like Charles Darwin motivated wanted learn God's world, obviously, science religion benefit co-existent relationship.

TL;DR: Science religion need opposed, work together well. True. news hasn‚Äôt focused plight minorities America much past couple months. I‚Äôm saying combative argumentivr way seeing 90-95% mask compliance(atleast public transit) think driving high infection rAte? Earth started symptoms yesterday

Hope pulls patient refused covid test admitted. Cousin asked even came said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. wanted medicine go home.‚Äù

People like force-quarantined. Hopefully 151 proof everclear 190 proof everclear case, would like give big 'Fuck you' Leave voters then. Look done country.  Trump smaller yaw, TMI shockingly low. Masks essential tool limiting disease, he's saying along. best way, invented them. guy said: ""Wasn't article basically saying people low IQ""

Then said: "" wasn't. ... showed correlation working memory another factor low compliance guidelines. ""

Then said: ""Working memory IQ correlated""

Lower working memory correlated low compliance guidelines. lower working memory also correlated lower IQ. low compliance correlated low IQ. Let guess, fucking trump republicans supporter..  don‚Äôt listen dumb fucks listen health professionals Korea New Zealand countries real leadership fighting covid could held phone booth fan base, seriously, listening screeching chalk board better. Ha. company us come back June 1 masks optional whole month. 3 45 us wore masks. There's also reason keep working home. Trying figure take empathetic stance not? 44.9848331

Congrats tagging random national park country live. least got country right.

You know what? bit unfair. found country map, credit that. referring government rather people.. think US time prepare learn mistakes made others... Good. Defrag? Common sense common live America would shocked happen. see Trump 2020 signs, hats, t-shirts, car stickers, name it. I've even seen Trump flags outside peoples houses, flying alongside USA flag. definitely strong movement. Folks two nostrils... sure hard. attended party acknowledged mistakes. Everyone sub wants pretend they‚Äôve never made mistake holier thou. I‚Äôm sure everyone never life made mistake taking phone driving. speeding. mistake like that. dude attended party probably wanted fun illusion human beings under: ‚Äúit won‚Äôt happen us‚Äù. Learn compassion. Last weekend, police called hotel work PA, masks supposed mandatory. Two officers arrived, neither wearing masks, dealing woman Florida, also wearing mask, none engaging social distancing. I'm grateful live Michigan competent state-level response. 

In event another wave could totally see Trump witholding federal assistance thinks we're ""ungrateful"" showing far behind Biden polls. Can't believe everyone wearing masks apart Micky!!. He's arsehole Yeah, think too. apple fall far tree. sure Making America Great Again. No, no, need sail [London doubt it'll get there... but... yeah got little bit topic, fault, sorry that. AZ deep shit, undeniably :-(

I hope guys get better situation soon. laughed ‚Äòway dangerous plague‚Äô. 
It‚Äôs people like reason called hoax. Stick facts hyperbole. work, got sunburnt butthole. Need aloe stat. lab? Oh, mean super secret lab everyone knows? missing food, found it. Lmao, people yet develop effective vaccine colds flus, much less cure them, give doctors extra week lockdown work covid they‚Äôll wrapped up.  ROFL confusing reddit life Noactive

Sorry anti-active much winning It‚Äôs employees feel bad hell fucking drug testing every single prospective employee every single job. 

What every happened land free?

Oh we, mean you, don‚Äôt Canada.

ACLU doesn‚Äôt care.

Edit: it‚Äôs beautiful husband , Alzheimer‚Äôs one worst fears later on. US currently 7x number active cases /capita canada. disparity growing faster every day. Put damned masks on. Ayyyyyyy weird cause wi way ahead proactive, virus finally starts come north GOP senators judges stiffarmed democratic gov forced hand reopen also shot extensive guideline bars places open. free all, half population desensitized refuse abide rules businesses put forward. would guessed cases exploded county worst offender places closing one one employees people start getting infected. 


We closed 90 days absolutely nothing. could've enhanced reopening done right kept virus south. nope, thanks republicans. 

Somehow gov gets blame. swear God people forget senators congress people actually exist levels well guess something president wrong yeah remember blame someone else. 

It's sad frustrating well hilarious. Fuck üòí coronavirus found packages inner wall container frozen shrimps imported Ecuador July noted nucleic acid tests shrimp bodies inner packages showed negative results

So shrimps inside packages tested negative. outside package inside shipping container tested positive. Sounds like covid positive people coughing inside shipping container

These shipping containers USA elected act control group. Unfortunately essential workers like ones die. mean...I WANT go. I‚Äôm going to. TBF, also frequently wanted go prior pandemic. $$. shit ain‚Äôt cheap. relevant would like see protest mandatory seatbelt laws organize crash mob other. implied though Herefordshire, Hertfordshire Yes, I'm familiar various levels triage work, I'm fine discussions veer quantitative speculative statistical. comparison simply apt. number confounding variables dissimilarities public health risks puts different healthcare category, rendering kind apples oranges comparison irrelevant. Motor vehicle accidents contagious. Motor vehicle accidents mutate. trauma lasting damage motor vehicle accidents survivors well-understood, coronavirus not. Motor vehicle accidents overwhelm ICUs healthcare resources enormous spikes death hospitalization rates matters days weeks. Etc.

Not mention fact resources directed coronavirus right sunk cost -- equally focused concerns similar death toll. made *abundantly clear* America's pandemic response capacity among worst entire developed world, absolutely crucial opportunity resources diverted need address that. pandemics future, United States desire longevity global superpower (which seems questionable day), would well recognize crisis call serious action, opportunity say ""WELL ACKSHULLY"" loud possibly can. children? Love that, thank Oh, case, would used expression ""like finding needle haystack"". maybe  think cease intelligent assume automatically one disagrees beliefs must uninformed poorly intentioned. We're fine, mind business. test lot, stable, low rates infection. Russian handlers want US crumble. goal support per se, cause US break apart like USSR did. revenge.

The real question whether narcassistic realize he's manipulated destroying us, he's greedy selfish care. I'm US citizen either, everything said chain assumption based able back points facts.

Someone responded effectively disproving original point highlighting valid hypothesis, switched vs us argument. deserve die someone else's ignorance though? medium sized city Cleveland, Ohio 93 new cases yesterday. say even imply that? There's massive difference study showing correlation ""all people wear masks idiots"" Yep, states whose governors prioritized earning brownie points reopening way early ultimately going break US's health care system demands aid due shortsightedness. Dems also need stop nominating awful candidates oligarchs tv tell to. one single issue led Trump. video paints COVID like rare childhood allergy Disney works hard keep things safe fun.

In reality, 5% Florida might dead within next three months. So... Lmao stupid Americans Darwin strikes again! sarcasm? That's quite large study sucker. mask anything hoax. There‚Äôs always people making excuses it‚Äôs European country America First wealthy, government. One thing clear we're victims. Sometimes hard pin blame. US government never done stimulate economy help American people. $2 trillion. appointments specific time slots, like doctor visit mentor lab. rediculious cant think outside box! This!!! cannot believe states watched went nothing. Ny chance. brand new, tests made, federal govt help ppe. tsunami.  Everything Ny, nj, ct inpedendently, organically creativity. states copy plan.  Instead wasted it. Funny I'm getting mocked, I'm swampgermany, we're seeing increased infections, sex workers working while. they're making money still functioning. Obviously slowed things locked down, economy never die. long people want goods services people willing accept money exchange things economy continue. Everybody still wants everything they've always wanted even waiting safe rush spend money getting them. demand there. changes someone always willing able get rich meeting demand.  keep thinking. 2 weeks they'll get, like bars. avoid going back work teacher, see find way take much 2 weeks least Yeahh seen areas even partys looks kind depressing honest good luck euros. money get secons wave Nice!  That's like Satan welcoming people mansion shit vomit people, problem free basement Arghh. I‚Äôm teacher well terrified. I‚Äôm worried sending children back, also give lessons small groups practice opportunities materials classroom, safe manner. Impossible...?! it? don‚Äôt know absolutely paralyzing. three weeks back classroom. completely understand parents go back work children needing ‚Äúget back learning,‚Äù cost lives? Maybe need slow society teach children co-ops natural world now. 

Clearly, one answers choice best everyone, shouldn‚Äôt afraid children elderly come contact them? 

I mean, thank God universe whomever want thank isn‚Äôt affect children seems elderly immune-compromised, don‚Äôt know yet. 

I‚Äôm conspiracy theorist pessimist don‚Äôt pretend know ins outs science behind all, know enough wary putting children possible harm‚Äôs way without information. year lives children state steady education undoubtedly affect them, contract virus lifelong health issues result? risk happening higher go back school point. 

Guess I‚Äôve talked homeschooling. Best luck, all! Like Trump said time place. N95 masks protect others pretending are?

I thought facts interesting wanted share. statement OSHA N95 masks: designed CONTAMINATED environments. means exhale N95 design exhaling contamination. exhale N95 masks vented breath straight without filtration. don‚Äôt filter air way out. don‚Äôt need to.

Conclusion: you‚Äôre Target guy Covid N95 mask, covid breath unfiltered exhaled Target (because designed already contaminated environments, it‚Äôs filtering air way out).

Also, another interesting statement surgical Surgical Mask: masks designed approved STERILE environments. amount particles contaminants outside indoor environments people CLOGGING masks very, quickly. moisture breath combined clogged mask render ‚Äúuseless‚Äù come contact Covid mask traps it, become walking virus dispenser. Every time put mask breathing germs EVERYWHERE went. changed thrown every ‚Äú20-30 minutes non sterile environment.‚Äù

The CDC reccomends wearing types masks website mainly due fact hospitals need surgical masks instead reccomend making one bandanna, cut-up T-shirt, scarf, make one sewing machine. Cloth masks come hazards exhale, ridding lungs contaminants carbon dioxide. Cloth masks trap carbon dioxide best. actually risks health, rather protect it. moisture caught masks become mildew ridden night. Dry coughing, enhanced allergies, sore throat symptoms micro-mold mask.

You fact checking Ah, course, thanks.  European, idea anyone think hoax. hoax created whom? realize whole world fighting right? US.. worry, we're testing now. That's possible reason numbers could look bad. üôÑüôÑüôÑ That's virus hoax Lol positive karma (33 time writing). Guess they're good... 41.8796946, 44.9848331 Mostly conservative especially suburbs Phoenix metro area probably half state's population Maricopa county. general mostly White Hispanic state also big outbreak Northern Arizona early native Navajo Nation one hardest hit per capita. Also hot hard things outdoors people indoors AC helps spread. Many people wearing masks last weeks people are. Also holidays neighborhoods would still see lot cars parked visit family friends Easter 4th July holidays may spread among friends family quite alarming people desire put fingers ears proclaim ""nothing see here, everything alright"". Occupancy limits. spread disease without symptoms testing positive. positive rate increased testing 15% thats pretty high man. I've read comment saying something like, ""go support employees there! Without opening park would unemployed!""

Never mind number people die decision. keep stock price stable. *Fuck you, Fox tells me*

*Fuck you, Fox tells me*

*Motherfucker!!!! Ugh!!* think something need really consider. LIFE guys seeing eye-to-eye. kid young kids vectors. sounds incredibly frustrating sounds like something he's going magically change. Shows deep-embedded beliefs aligned. :( :( even read numbers? louisiana currently southern state ALMOST half many deaths per 100k new york. Friend mine got tested July 1st still received results back yet. told they're backed couple weeks going get worse.  Yes, could think like that. Residents capitol way think. absolutely bat shit insane. 15,000. One day.

We need national intervention now. I‚Äôm okay states withholding federal taxes response, dipping taxes make losses federal funding cut. anyone wants go hang outside July Florida mask beyond me. couldn‚Äôt pay go Orlando July even without pandemic. can't find exact numbers people allergic, people getting cancer treatments can't handle it, small children young, etc. coincidental FL 6x cases CT actually 600 FEWER deaths CT does. Despite us state full old people. 

YEAH MAKES SENSE /s Plenty cases reinfection personally know two people happened to. joke order always goes Russian, Putin, Stalin... incredible. Rhinovirus usually cold. School daycare system working people. That's about. Send link Disney gonna get heat US govt truly fucking people. quite sad see really like US hopes visiting soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

An idiot charge always mean disaster. surgeon general tweeted masks make safer back March, people packing bars May/June \*after\* seeing happened NY....

&amp;#x200B;

Even right now, keep saying there's hotspots etc painfully obvious places without lot cases \*will\* see lot cases enforce distancing measures today. Wow, Michigan seeing day next day turnaround. 9 days, someone may close recovered mild response then. woman evil.

Even go remote, schools still need funding online learning. forcing schools reopen.

Note: Florida school system one earliest start school year, meaning they'd starting less month now. impossible cases fall way significantly slows spread.  People ages healthy die common cold

I dont understand point retarded articles LMFAO!!! Go fun COVID19 party. It'll take breath away.

And really, can't better ""libtards""??

PATHETIC!! democratic republic US least pretends be, military subject civilian oversight. Donald J Trump incompetent command chief military. General Half Track like (and like it), resign. Disobeying presidential orders option.

The military self-interested. Anyone self-interested would never go dangerous mission. Soldiers ultimately pawns time time may sacrifice pawns greater good. difference currently throwing away pawns vanity Glorious Leader. Yes federal government probably could ban interstate (around 4 minutes in) Exactly; like there's 6 popes per square mile vatican. Things never get misleading divisor smaller unit used. Lol fellow smoker, would agree you. also heard france one point prescribing nicotine patches. I'd love deaths suspicious. see Arizona 2500 cases declaring 86 deaths Florida 15k cases, 45? Sure man, I'm pretty sure accurate. guess Florida, thanks Trump De Santis got weak strain virus, combined miracolous drugs cure can't used anywhere else AND, top that, Florida state young (and strong immune systems) getting infected. Sure mate. Where? There's interesting psychological study somewhere. understand US Guam part of, different voting rights citizens different areas. think right. votes would likely matter grand scheme things America, deny even that? Strange... Florida July deadly virus loose. Sign up. Santa Claus said? fact chose article suggests you‚Äôre way depth brunch?! Lol! Exactly. getting test bored. jump back immune systems forget. going Corona seasons every 4 5 months going forward random states possibly forever. think they're right. sizable minority looks see careful ones much. said, ‚ÄúIt feels like‚Äù given NBA, WNBA, MLS season going haha. Within bubble course. country single digit cases aren‚Äôt even allowed play recreational ball public courts Jesus Christ, would never see speak again. can‚Äôt even go. banned going basically confirm. biggest danger though uv. Keep sun burn drink lots water youre good. also take brakes cooler

I usually go 4 5 bottles worth water work day usually pee unemployment system Florida complete disaster. took immediate family 2 months get paid. pay 300 dollars week without 600 boost. going get ugly 600 boost expires shit gets shut again. Depends fast make vaccines, know right now, already making oxford one. US already ordered 300 million doses vaccine. crazy look culture Japan vs Americans . shows kind people live country . theory right, small numbers per capita misleading. athlete Liechtenstein wins one gold medal olympics, Liechtenstein 25 times many medals per capita UK, saying 25 times better olympics really painting accurate picture.

The goes corona. one bad outbreak caused 1 person capital Andorra, immediately super high infection rate per capita, mean they're bad job necessarily. per capita measures population needs large enough occurence needs frequent enough freak incidents (one good athlete one bad outbreak) significant effect.

Because this, would fairer count countries like Andorra Liechtenstein. one point Vatican highest infection rate world one single infection. population small that's already 0.1%. I‚Äôm going rephrase original comment think there‚Äôs disconnect.

This article present possible case reinfection, author concluded reinfection possible based 1 patient testing positive twice.

The author discussing reinfection default scenario, placed much emphasis hypothesis potential reinfections likely severe article written general audience. Neither point scientific consensus, article could mislead uninformed readers. Goodness, highest NY 11,500 cases one day...and one month mandatory lockdown mandatory wear mask order.... Florida doesn‚Äôt even shelter place order mandatory face mask order... Florida going beat NY total coronavirus cases Election Day.... looked site there's next information runs it. Disappointed report record one made big. DeVos wants send kids back school plan. Criminal. watch either one. TV news. Closing would kill people virus would. I'm pretty certain standard since shutdowns began. started state, supposedly two weeks, two weeks, two more-- mean, fourth time that, lot people caught never gonna two weeks. 

I think probably short enough time think cause citizens panic. USA brain drain recourse letting virus fester. 

I think making America stupider solution world looking for. 


You forgetting nukes here? get actual PCR positive test positive antibodies need better test. Moderna looks like pump dump scheme every day live Florida, visiting home town. people area probably visiting mine. small world. see microscope. Well, *do* prove intelligent still cunt, congratulations that... old he? pre existing conditions? Good luck telling trans people stop taking hormone treatments. Many would rather die Covid-19 disconnected something feel makes lives worth living.

I dont blame them, HRT negative health consequence might pair well Covid-19 - blood clotting hypertension two possible. Trans individuals get choose whether continue treatment also aware increase risk. I'm pretty sure Republican rallies safe. Goodness, highest NY 11,500 cases one day...and one month mandatory lockdown mandatory wear mask order.... Florida doesn‚Äôt even shelter place order mandatory face mask order... Florida going beat NY total coronavirus cases Election Day.... remember it‚Äôs lot oversight, lack updating policies territories, general neglect. Guam left behind rot politicians don‚Äôt know N. Korea makes clockwork threat bomb it. 70,000 new cases Friday... even worse numbers probably today... Congress vacation.

Un-fucking-believable. Anybody's hope really straightforward: wearing fucking mask. can't done wearing mask, outside home.

Is hard understand? hard do? US can't follow Sweden's response Americans irresponsible health care system makes Sweden's plan work. way healthcare set America much greater part play COVID rampant people give credit for. Look schools see obesity. say people think kids die suffer.  Okay could shut whereas US can't ban interstate travel. would even helpful regional approach (Northeast, South, Midwest, etc.) that's possible either. ""recommended quarantines"" Don‚Äôt give ideas. I'll wait answer question.

But I'd like point message message Whitehouse always 'everyone look individual situation, talk health care provider, make decision wear mask follow local state guidelines requirements"". They've gone many times press briefings. Actual words statements. taking advice anything POTUS (regarding anything) talking professional... one help you. Trump starts walking around without pants on, guarantee following example either Awesome, sounds like virus running course! Good time quit teacher Cognitive dissonance. believe either, friend apparently went MS, TN, AZ Spring break. tell traveling hike together (social distancing wearing mask). livid. then, make matters worse, texted days later tell tested positive (well shit). I'm getting tested tomorrow. symptoms, thankfully, upset ever seeing her. know friendship recover. im absolutely stumped numbers lining JHU data official data. note Florida parks open since second week June. It‚Äôs Disney gets press. Seaworld, Universal, along water parks smaller attractions like funspot open while. It‚Äôs vicious circle. Government support well-being people adequately offer support necessary services. Populace distrusts government. Populace elects ‚Äúsmall government‚Äù people think won‚Äôt interfere much ‚Äúfreedoms‚Äù. Government full corrupt, malignant self servicing assholes serve public. Government, true word, fails protect populace crisis, time. OK top head I'll look research comparison articles later. believe scarlet fever severe right away. Versus covitt strange proportionality every single cases critically serious many many cases mild call it. that‚Äôs case Chinese vaccine one could rely on. Oxford vaccine relies voluntary participation I‚Äôd bet house Chinese one need volunteers could get 100000 samples flick fingers ‚Äúseats‚Äù callously call make sweet sweet money.  born turn profit, could deny them?  Sad. absolutely right. Unless strict border controls interstate travel inevitable virus surge spillover neighboring regions. want national plan &amp; coordinated containment policy, least split US self-contained regions could provide kind firewall assurance. Yes. point? right around unmasked, bring anger follows frequently. Someone gets sick dies free speech at; ICU, dirt, cremated.
 
tHeY sTaY hOmE 

...is usual retort. ever time lmao don‚Äôt get kids aren‚Äôt vectors

And obviously give shit staff families! Wearing proper mask plus social distancing aware dont seem mentally understand teeny tiny things able kill them; might help keep safer Boy going sting guys lives saved Oxford vaccine americans without full representation look someone's profile get dig them, sad that? That‚Äôs horrible. Hospitals running ICU beds place isn‚Äôt serving anyone? start pandemic state gave state ventilators well didn‚Äôt need others did. Pitch share load. supposed United. forgotten one. know. virus spreads infected droplets inhaled. 

Where inhale droplets matter.

Fresh air bad viruses generally. mean fresh air completely eliminates transmission risk. may reduce it, reduction mean zero. Economy stock market. forget Milgram! rate, 3 weeks today Florida reporting 100k cases per day alone. Hopefully absolute madlad bare minimum. 

I wonder anti mask base going information. best news seen last 3 months. probably bribe ‚Äúcmooon we‚Äôll put seal make PRESIDENTIAL mask‚Äù bet tested positive covid ! moron talked Trump protecting health? Probably publicity... wore mask! time! (Trump commercial mask). I'm sick ""President thing always done"" news. dash tax fraud. God... Yeah sorry.. governors say possible believe /s OHHH LOOK DELETED REPLY?

Freaking stupid idiot. Go back school learn read please, might make fool (I seriously doubt intellect). researchers think infectious dose play role matter much immune response.

Thats I‚Äôve come know.

However, infectious dose could explain healthy nurses 30s die vs overweight people 40s caught grocery store asymptotic. think it‚Äôs worth looking wondering studied. It‚Äôs terrifying me, living Florida. Worried husband family learn wreaks havoc heart.. probably outsource masks presidential seal China getting three months.

/s might identified lazy communist earlier saved lot typing. is. Yeah, people forget sports create community communities aren‚Äôt stereotypical bad.

I sports reporter covered women‚Äôs athletics. Female athletes impressive students I‚Äôve worked either reporter later college professor. community support system create impressive they‚Äôre losing year.

But us losing something year. home instead camping friends. PhD library information science can‚Äôt go libraries. 

We sacrificing sucks. 99% don‚Äôt it. it‚Äôs somewhere around 99% survivable? 1% 1% catch could die. Guess I‚Äôll take chances. fucking hospital. fucks sake doomers shit. 1 100 across us, words, places 1 10,000. Others 1 10 Lol that's lawsuit want fight MIOSHA they'll lose. governor's emergency powers give full authority this. business walking fun line liability Covid risk you, fellow employees, customers. Awesome thanks! knew something ‚Äústupid‚Äù ‚Äúidiotic‚Äù lol shingles. Completely disabled 31. RIP anyone gets it. ruins life. Fucking wow! Fucking. wow. read this, read again. Stood up, read again.

This exactly fucks go. can‚Äôt believe put trust Dickhead Ducey. 

It took Republicans 3.5 years spread stupidity. It‚Äôs greatest fight face right now. Unreal. ""dozens dead"" But... but... masks help... medical condition... etc. etc. etc. jr's girlfriend virus. fine dandy trump everyone else problems, instant hits family decides make change himself. Maybe they‚Äôll finally give antibiotics syphylis. Gonna roll cheese tho. I‚Äôm surprised happens US Considering Latinos half Los Angeles' population, kind brainer would. Sign door reads facemask required. Enters without facemask. Yup. aspect never get traction due fucktards invading discussions saying fine since children risk get infected like concern solely kids first place. Maybe give mask makes airplane noises? guaranteed point southern states like Alabama live refusing anything. Lovely Maybe COVID attacks brain. seems everything else. Officers wear 20 pounds PPE everyday can't bothered small piece cloth faces. show work without vest, mask? Wow, got live one here.

Didn't expect see someone thinks covid still hoax reddit. read almost neurological virus attacks signals different organs. UK scientists found deceased patient's brain stem theorize might lay dormant like chickenpox adults get hit shingles. know little even nonsense I'd rather risk kid's entire future health. one thinks that, point: don‚Äôt wear mask go Disney World, catch COVID die, it‚Äôs Darwin work? fact people keep bringing still relevant political attack Fauci. kids guinea pigs? Awesome. It‚Äôs definitely textbook Trump move. Saying ‚Äútextbook‚Äù ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù sentence feels incredibly weird, despite fact American president doubt lots textbooks, isn‚Äôt already. psychology textbooks lol Whatever works! *tears rain Thank you. saving grace dorm singles.. trying stay positive, it‚Äôs scary. Guy work hoax mask. arguing wear anymore, that's concerned with. We‚Äôre proud you, Donnie. must really hard you! You‚Äôre tough cookie! /s Warned everyone??? Dont give fucking shit! That's filthy fucking lie know it. post health issues? kids? 137,000 deaths 1% population infected absurd. That's 3.5 million cases 380 million population. Hospitals overflowing hot spots refrigeration trucks dead. Yeah, fear! need imagine 5%, need wait 5 days... He‚Äôs visiting hospital course he‚Äôs gonna wear one . controlled environment people regularly tested like White House . I've even magical moment water ingest automatically go piss. like body ends great balance pulling much water making minimal urine, keep chugging water, keep going. 

Its glorious moment happen Ok paranoid theory here: wondering maybe reason president wants schools session person Aug 17 WANTS Covid-19 spread everywhere time cause havoc chaos November election. Kids bring families. It‚Äôll spread like wildfire like AZ TX. also lowering standards coronavirus-ready. Maybe president‚Äôs administration wants easier virus spread quickly. Maybe hoping October things bad elections can‚Äôt held normally? dunno... Please persuade theory crazy. possible, buy it. Trump got stubborn person I've ever seen. think he'd change mind unless specifically big event happened Relevant? Like guy bled front called disgusting. pro mask; knew masks good told us use them. felt would make run NEEDED front line workers.

I understand reasoning, never sits well govt lies you. National Debt represents money motion country opposed household model money owed... that's... actually scary might fulfilling promise. American Economy: Absolute Zero. Somewhat. depends keep whole time, cover nose &amp; mouth, use new one every time, snug fit, material made &amp; touch all. lot ifs. opinion people wear masks &amp; educated small protection vs they're ""forced to"". ^ Ahhh, gotcha NBA Bubble part Disney probably safest place FL. bEtTeR lAtE nEvEr Break popcorn. wanna see diehards contort this, justify ultimately complying medical science, perish defense gaslighting. Mouse demands sacrifice. admitted mistaken changed position new information surfaced.

No. Fauci admitted concerned public compete medical staff masks, thus went message healthy people need wear masks. IKEA air conditioning least. 2009 pandemic flu went like nuke soon schools opened. pretty well burned regular flu season even began. honestly looks badass. Imagine embraced beginning said going lead us together? COVID would DONE here. Fucking way done. kids supposed vectors according White House. Fox news rides centric line claiming minor things sway viewer base. ""We acknowledge science behind wearing masks, think numbers swayed 'main stream media' support agenda."" get claim support science people come it, also claim they're staying strong conservative values get called that. might looking far wonder wearing usual red tie without mask something blue tie mask. already paid Disney+ year, would cancel subscription. That's almost kind honestly. calculated way baby's tantrum calculated, say fricken all. better outdoors least? There's saying, ""A Recession neighbor gets laid off. Depression *you* get laid off.""

The applies here. Perspective pandemic depends impacts you. Careful sub doesnt like kind truth. Well I'm sure glad NBA everything necessary daily tests bubble. like shortage reagents supplies anything Would look that. right look like idiot wearing mask. However looks like idiot without one too. Probably Trump finally caved said he‚Äôd wear mask hospital today. :) means post-covid, heart muscle weakened left ventricle able pump effectively. ejection fraction much blood volume ventricle able ""eject"" contracts. weaker heart, weaker contraction, thus less blood pumped effectively. Congestive heart failure (CHF) results. symptoms CHF include shortness breath difficulty flat-lying, exercise intolerance, swelling legs ... basically resulting fluid build-up due poor heart. Trump already it. Today said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never masks...‚Äù They‚Äôve started already. McConnell tweeted bullshit week ago. lip service. number survivors later stated bouncer stopped people trying escape via stage exit, stating door ""for band only.""

That fuckin sickening get point, perception interpretation matters here. He's saying wear mask necessary, never camera. say always supported masks, base dumb swing votes believe it. reason short term people's memories God forsaken country. true, also mean conservatives likely lower cognitive ability? seems pretty serious wearing mask thing freedom. Hard see changing without serious education. I've worked different universities last twenty years. University students, even graduate terminal degree programs, great spreading colds, flu, illnesses. Close quarters, penalties missing classes, thinking they're bulletproof makes perfect vectors. They're almost worse elementary schoolers taught know better. looks much better can't see face would rather deal meltdowns die me. Everyone‚Äôs still alive, seems! Hmm November, might go thanksgiving something Interesting article, thanks sharing! Listen he‚Äôs clearly operating giving single shit bc it‚Äôs rigged anyway knows he‚Äôs going ‚Äúwin‚Äù. zero fucking faith democracy. say, someone close got knows something. think would orange? I‚Äôm betting it‚Äôs solely cause hospital refused entry unless sucked wore fuckin mask  Sweden, researchers also found staff members day cares primary schools likely people working professions contract virus.

Or don‚Äôt know enough it‚Äôs spread, likely spread, etc. however showing kids far less likely infected guy who‚Äôs said people tired experts... love opposing thought gets downvoted oblivion person gets told go another sub. Differing viewpoints encouraged intelligent conversation had. one person answered questions, instead people throw tantrums. like one big circle jerk difference thought opinion ruins session lol know, really tracking hospitalizations alongside contagious cases deaths. publications read say 1% (+- 0.5%) people infected seem die - proper medical care.  
That‚Äôs consistent earliest Chinese publications.  

70‚Äô000 people newly infected per day means 700 dead men walking / coughing, long rest hast access medical care.  
About 10% (+- 5%) need special treatment likely survive treated. 
That‚Äôs 10‚Äô000 people may die severe damages top can‚Äôt access medical infrastructure breaks down. 

I unfortunately idea many people may die hospitals busy treating COVID-19.  

All per day, guessing minimum average time week infection, test result seems right.  wildly assumptive. ever two colds one winter? American exceptionalism think US less cases EU? Tucson also conservative. Gotta number 1 think subtle bullshit. ridiculous number clinical trials vaccine candidates running now. They‚Äôre moving slowly, either... Well Germany average rate 9 deaths per day die getting infected. 

So 120 corona deaths per day sound realistic. (The UK average 86 127 one day) There's rule America saying stay home. guideline we'd like followed, says go public building without mask. barely inconvenience; wore mask 40 hours week Granite Fabricator. tired excuses first one. Americans fucking pathetic, that's coming one. New definition ""herd immunity"" That's quite apparent. get (besides obvious we're still enough Boris needs stricter) Brazil really goes radar this.

2nd worst word media know put 'USA' 'UK' stories,it gets traction gets conversations going criticisms thrown around taking BF instead... Hey gramps. first Color Computer 3. looking, appears parents got soon came out.

I remember software cassettes, writing basic code. (well, copied magazines back day.. holy shit, would print source code magazine... old..) Well great time American! Wearing mask reduces chances contracting covid 65% going you. Brings back memories  That's bad  went 'Here's today, cool?' 'HERES OPINION HIT LIKE SHARE' believe terms deaths per million, UK one worst performing world.  Nevada Arizona 1 2 wait vilifies vaccine simultaneously invented it. Denmark, population 5,8 mio. Number COVID patients ICU care friday: 4.

Besides UHC enjoy service trustworthy (enough least) politicians working across center line obtain compromises providing stable government direction works times crisis well. idea, try it!  I'm surprised take place Florida lol FYI, quintessential eagle screech know actually hawk. Honestly, pandemic confirmed American stereotypes never took *that* seriously. insane much worse US compared western countries. time prepare. stop unfortunately. political issue team digging fight election coming up.

I'm sitting across border watching dumpster fire US. wont fine ppl Thank this. hate point people use saying Fauci lying, therefore never trusted. I‚Äôve begun understand black white Americans hope education evolves, find way overcome sorts shortcomings. truly impact country, public health safety, generally dividing us more. welcome backrooms like country much better.  It‚Äôs like Florida wasn‚Äôt completely expected Florida guess nobody knows Chinese Barber shops Fake News sounds unconstitutional. wonder pushed law... hmm. happy now? phase 1, correct. Hm thought spray face lemon water dry fan. one know died it!!!! even wear mask never it!! cousin got never symptoms bro, flu!! Herd immunity shit ^^^^^^\s People can't even get high grade sanitizers home easily, suggesting enough douse rides surfaces one largest theme parks world right now... Seriously?

""Sorry little Timmy, know needed keep house santized pandemic, Karen really needed get theme park.""

Every day become embarrassed American.

Edit: Looks like mouse shoe another South Park cameo near future. Big boy! even idea provides protection another COVID infection without mutation. Freeeeeeeedom! üôà bizarre world, day brandished gun wore mask. different circumstances. specifically written law handled agencies keep health information private. one going authorize retail store restaurant owner check immunization documentation none would ever want liability dealing records. left Trump vs Left vs Right political election year side.... clear discrepancies counting what. It‚Äôs obvious, yeah keep societal biases. OP = bundle sticks. No-clip exploit successfully deployed!

That's fascinating thing dysfunctional people. cling dysfunction even interests. I'm boat. I've looking answers get sense smell taste back almost four months able honestly upsetting (lost around March 20th) - want able actually enjoy food drink smell favourite smells. one favourite bottles ale last night (Newcastle Brown Ale) ever tasted hugely distinguishable smell taste notice either smell taste. 


I also smell sweat stick nose right armpit - week two ago working happy could actually smell something unappealing nose right armpit.  


I've smelling jar coffee every day sticking nose right smell horrible one can't remember coffee supposed smell bad little smell fucked alters proper smells. Got right first half Faketriots. Went gas station 2 days ago 3 people inside wearing masks. Yesterday stopped different gas station 1 employees wearing one. wild west here! really pisses people saying shit beliefs compassionate. It‚Äôs fucking belief you‚Äôre something endangers lives anyone come contact with. It‚Äôs grossly negligent, it‚Äôs selfish, deserving zero compassion. beliefs made dead, way know else died them. Fuck shit. sunday?? lowest point week wish optimistic, yeah... article states safe effective? big groups? anyone information? Well trump saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs we‚Äôre testing‚Äù anyone knowledge testing confirm that‚Äôs true? can't say ""they knew"" such.

They knew. whole argument media blowing proportion means media good job making sure EVERYONE new. I'm wondering. EU countries put Covid infected patients elderly care homes, etc? go great future documentary badly fucked up. leaves immunocompromised children, lockdown now. nephew leukemia daughter chronic asthma turns pneumonia frequently.

It's like people assume kids tough, American-made ain't gonna go Chinese virus!

A lot kids virtually immunities yet, yeah much worse expect. mention obese kids. people watch pictures videos ICUs body bags people died virus, think ‚Äústaged media.‚Äù Pathetic. Greetings Elon... Don‚Äôt insult children. vile, selfish scumbags. employees costumes? fuck imagine sharing storm trooper outfit. sterilise that? love stupidity Anti-mask people. RIP missed agree sentiment, would think someone asshole wore one top proper mask. Zhoosh little Somehow realized key lesson make sure control virus spread prior opening businesses schools.

The US clearly doesn't, even consider thinking reopening schools. dont really obsess pay attention dipshit says. pay attention scientific study's coming political kayfabe. kind assumed people saying anti mask never seen one probably made one comment media ran blew proportion. genuinely curiuous... said anti mask? learned. Comment stands. Belgium Japan, schools abandoning certain social distancing measures, alternate-day schedules extra space desks. decided part-time voluntary school attendance, supplemented distance learning, enough ‚Äî full classrooms preferable leaving kids home. disease won‚Äôt magically disappear, first wave passed curve flattened. strict measures taken competent governments suppressed virus prevented major outbreaks.

The end ""first wave"" disease starts burn out, that's time R number gets 1. western European governments responded worse less competently even US, got hit first less still prevalent people adhering guidelines, unlike US many people think wearing mask infringement god given right oxygen even though studies show effective, well thinking it‚Äôs hoax bad.

HAHHAHHAHHHAHHAHHAHHHAHH... HAHHAHAHHHAHHAHHA. actually live Europe (kind of, geographical debate), many friends live Western Northern Europe. People bad worse Americans many European countries masks. Nobody wants wear ""don't look cool"". never became political issue never made news Americans read. live one countries masks already socially / culturally acceptable found 3,038 new cases yesterday, 0.04% population. European Union recorded number, would equate 0.0007% population. means multiple different countries different responses managed better response one state US.

Compare Europe peak Arizona now. math. Turns out, Europe way worse, cherry-picking point time justify could manage even attempt defend downplay statistics absolutely pathetic proves delusional touch reality are.

Translation: ""HOW DARE hysterical emotionally unhinged like everyone else!!!""

Hysteria literally opposite science.

Don't let door hit way out. herd immunity literally means 70% population becomes infected, herd immunity never achieved human history. lives gambled with, half population fucking clueless. It‚Äôs legal, buried somewhere. Remember would immigrants getting let country would make provide proof they‚Äôd vaccinated. Kids get asked provide info starting school. It‚Äôs legal.

Look seasonality debate, everybody completely attached ""we know yet! there's evidence seasonality! idea!""

I always thought slavery. hey, I'm American idea that's popular sentiment there. it‚Äôs longer:
-A hoax
-Fake news
-Made story
-Number cases going zero time soon 
-To ignore testing
-To ignore wearing mask
-To endure stupid, twatwaffle Karens 
-To believe Dementia Donald says cases way down. going opposite direction. I've reading thread see mentioned. Actually, think Mormons' fault, disagree. However, group this, now, they'd essentially committing apostasy local church leaders instructed wear masks and, yes, that's thing. spreads matter population, density well. still apples apples comparison.

It's dense pockets people even state like Arizona, failure properly shut safely reopen, belligerence population (the people say things).  Per capita? know Arizona is.

People actually drive way Texas Florida? That‚Äôs insane. Lol looked subreddit seems COVID exist world. admitted early too. said, ""if enough masks everyone"", would help prevent asymptomatic spread. common cold consists hundreds genetically different viruses... different types coronaviruses different types rhinoviruses parainfluenza.

I must confess, beginning become tiresome, engaging battle wits one deficient ammunition. know anyone fun park like that? Eerily quiet, mascots stay socially distanced wearinga stuffy mask hot weather. great time going mall recently changes. can't imagine paying go Disney world time. Maricopa county said last week press conference taking 10 days get 95% test results back. Must nice. start work office tomorrow :/ trying mean understanding economics. 

Just take step back little reading people spend money on. currently 1% we‚Äôre sure infected date get 70% would take us 280 months social distancing stops 75% entire damn population infected virus. Sounds crazy rate US going, fucking summer, it‚Äôs inevitable. Stone age? thing long time. used measles chicken pox parties too. dumb? Hell yeah, new concept.

Surprised haven‚Äôt seen full white, pointy type public yet. One story CA back, haven‚Äôt seen here...yet.  tried making chocolate-flavoured mask?

""mild"" case means hospitalized. data capture still home sick 8 weeks Either call Photoshopped fake news. That's damn well easier wear mask... didnt lie them, even may wrong advice. Public health advice needs factor-in practical considerations. clearly case COVID-19, early outbreak. get testing love money qualify test capacity scarce. Doctor told phone self-quarantine get medical care showed signs severe illness. even bother track report statistics, far know.

It kind thing expect happen developing country, United States America. grandmother dead 10 years now. 105 passed.

As far what‚Äôs driving this, lot what‚Äôs incorporated U.S. curve coming California, Arizona, Florida, Texas, Ohio, Carolinas. Probably big populous states I‚Äôm thinking of. ignore Georgia because, well, governor exactly inspire confidence accuracy numbers. (Florida neither *reported* numbers bad impossible disregard.) math currently divides total number dead total number cases. understand saying. calculation skews rate slightly low active cases might become deaths future. however hand death divided recovered, would also skew true mortality rate high taking account majority active cases likely end death. good news time goes data have, less skewed numbers become. might worth adding separate column second mortality numbers Former pro musician here. Let tell y'all Great White stories. 

My old band ended booked weeklong run Great White two states, well-connected whole hair-band 80s scene played damn near years. (The main exceptions Motley Crue Bon Jovi, though might others i'm forgetting.) 

We get close first date Great White, huge theater-club middle fucking nowhere, like half hour outside big college town. 

The day before, we're informed GW canceled show. thing like get right show, come back make additional demands venue/promoter, cancel can't/won't meet them. screws everyone involved real reason GW's egos. 

Whatever, next show. *They cancel one day meant go on.*

Each time, Facebook honest fans, ""this nothing us, want perform guys."" whole thing ended getting canceled due dickbags, got bad, us band set open shows getting messages music magazines asking kind drama us GW. NO, WE'VE STILL NEVER EVEN MET THEM. 

Fuck Great White. I'm glad they're still putting shittiness display.

In fact, age 70 reasonably healthy, much *better* flu terms survival. Critical thinking skills something Americans lack Universal isnt media, thats why.

Almost every country gotten handle leaders allow experts guide. Trump instead incapable taking others advice narcissism spouts garbage like ""99% cases harmless"". Trump single reason US situation they're in.

The US example to, instead example to. Firefighter/EMT here, I‚Äôm contact covid patients homes nearly every shift I‚Äôm worried sick. least there‚Äôs hope catch it, union (one growing unions U.S) make sure medical bills paid for. department treating every employee covid assumption got shift medical bills taken care of. gotta worry catching dying aware surroundings....

Weird single word, context meaning encourages discussion, downvoted.

But least pathetic victim complex it, that's entertaining least. Considering point fact North Korea supposedly cares less people country world would hard pressed find better example. offense intended. U.S. don‚Äôt consider (or communicate) overweight pre-existing condition. ""But- he's liberals begged STILL happy!!"" mean, that's intuition, looking source. I'll try find one.  Ignorant comment democratic leaders DC recorded laughing number cases deaths say thing are. democrat leaders teets suckling laughing americans dying furthers agenda. sides bad other. wake  someone else thought useful. cool story social animals. stop people sex save HIV/AIDS, can't stop socializing save COVID-19. That's important come protocols allow people socialize safely. One universal masking, COVID-19 condoms HIV/AIDS. There's also physical distancing, ventilation indoor spaces, hygiene, etc. must enforced. common cold caused 200 viruses don‚Äôt get immune probably haven‚Äôt caught them.

But right different viruses different immunity durations life months. got fight someone work, literally screaming top lungs, fucking snapped cause fucking idiot thinks Covid hoax. grandmother got survived gives fucks virus isnt taking seriously.  varies countries, share deaths care homes total deaths high european countries. example, country (Spain) 69% covid confirmed deaths come elderly care homes. idiots Canada. many, exist. massively undertesting. Deaths could nasty surprise... Yeah shit Sherlock Sitting hands fewhile months schools can't reopened. countries able send kids back used closure time wisely, instead thinking nothing going help.  China count asymptomatic cases official number. think virus ever reached herd immunity without vaccine. 
They never problem saying nation fault somehow always requires ""unigue american solution"". Economic shitty start, mate. distractions mind

This problem ADHD teen. completely unable get schoolwork done spring, online school complete disaster them. know do, options suck kids screwed. UK far deaths per 100,000 people planet. would never post reason. /r/WeirdCommaUsage remembered Pete Navarro AMA reddit billed ""China Expert."" people asked lack Chinese language ability, lack inclination consult Chinese sources matter, hypocritical, Navarro proclaimed ""gotcha"" question make look bad. 

But hey, Navarro ""China Expert"" Trump's Whitehouse. surprise next line replace Dr. Fauci. I'm canadian 60% cases per capita 36% deaths per capita ok. took strong measures early slowly opening. company brother works would pay desk, chair, computer monitors work home.

I know company works see allowance that. It‚Äôs state telling something Disney close people remain without income? Getting evicted, food, etc? Thats solution? government provided Universal Income different story, idiots dont seem think that.

Instead crying close everything provide everyone income, close everything? None mention seem forget people need place sleep food table terrifying AZ, people mindset ""we locked weeks already, working home everything, we're re-open phase, before""

So business usual many, restaurants open 50% cap, state mask mandate. hot many think hot covid. co-worker got spent 8 days hospital, 4 others family infected. father heart attack it. Yet co-workers, also co-workers, STILL tell democrat smear campaign ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In grocery stores, besides employees one five wear masks. majority wear nose.. terrifying. Well...is Arizona testing more? Seems like that's easy shut true. Wow, that's sad still get better what's important build it. 

I'm close 30, quite active (badminton exercise) ongoing symptoms roughly 5 weeks. Fortunately me, still lift much even play ""usual"" sets Badminton. running much difficult although still shorter distances before. also feel fatigue come go, guess got easy. 

From experience, definitely ""just regular flue"". 
Hang there, it'll get better! forget, vast majority country lose ability outdoor dining in, around, late September/early October. Even living NY, feel real possibility massive spike unemployment again, due restaurants go back delivery/take-out business. Unfortunately, time around $600 week save anyone, eviction protections gone.... gonna blood bath! Silver lining, rampant MAGA country.

Same. finally started build nice little life soon wife. hospital bill bankrupt us. seriously want rip noses see it. Since eyes suck it‚Äôs consolation [I wonder Chicken Pox relatively harmless children, dangerous adults. made sense intentionally infect kids kind early vaccination.

People comparing going right fucking minds.

That's they're trying tell you...

;p Considering experience Borris it, I'm amazed enough wakeup call elevate masking requirements.  think safe zone would quite sensible travel limitations. cannot stop interstate traffic along roads, sure hell target air traffic hotels.

So act nothing do.

That's liberal hoax disappear November. /s


I know people legit believe happening, numbers inflated, doctors writing everything Covid deaths, even car crashes happened test positive postmortem. can't even people. day week. Good point misery loves company :'( goes ability hold guess think saying beginning people hoard n95s order hospitals get much PPE possible.

Not saying right, someone boxes masks basement much needed right either. Lysol way powerful could poison food wipe. 

Soap water enough kill coronavirus 5 mins rubbing alcohol works almost instantly well. Rubbing alcohol best evaporates residue dissolves ink packaging. 

I wipe every non-food package rubbing alcohol anything eat wash soap water. Yeah, well. president politicized pandemic. So, people aren‚Äôt going follow simple changes.

What blows mind, people say we‚Äôre better heading right direction? We‚Äôre 70k cases day states reporting 20%+ positivity rates? Come man. going spread take complying. deniers die virus, hopefully move on. immunocompromised need stay time come contact deny virus. 

I really think deny reality situation refuse wear mask, taking hospital beds. Save space people fell victim idiots. Google naked capitalism hyperinflation.

Basically short must lose ability produce goods people want order get hyperinflation. nothing printing money.

I agree points.

A federal response would helped eventually New York get shit together.

But god absolutely amazing many people get extremely offended suggest New York could done better.

Newsom California another great example. think Arizona testing rate 60 times higher EU???? also know 137k significantly lower real number people died COVID19.

Fact matter is, getting herd immunity would result millions American deaths, point comparison. Sitting arguing exact number comes missing forest trees. Sorry already asked answered, specify drastic measures taken New York pls? rhetoric hear test much much looser standards counts positive, point it'd account 6x difference. Insane type bullshit idiots beleive. Agreed masks still important resident Arizona I‚Äôd like specify maricopa county, home ASU primary culprit here. Hey, least people inclined stay fuck home.

I'll first admit damn near everyone downplayed beginning still telling people subway safe second week March. think important remember 32k people died NY clearly bad decisions made. lose many people without bad decisions. think biggest fact one believed virus bad unfortunately devastating consequences NY dependence public transportation close living quarters.

I hope NY learns ever threat like again, take action swiftly. rest country, regardless bad decisions opening gatherings such, likely never affected like NY. Karen means ""any white woman anything like""? Wake friend. went bankrupt six times including casino. house always wins, unless Trump. bet virus spread like fire.

Edit: I‚Äôd also add apparently, don‚Äôt subscribe notion bitten, twice shy. We‚Äôre soft culture

Boy ain't truth. Half damn country walking around looking like ER doctor masks gloves. half pussies. think like old saying. owe $2000, problem. owe $200,000, problem. Max fine individual $500. $10k businesses we've seen elsewhere. gym Yakima County, Washington fined $10k weeks ago managed pay whole thing GoFundMe... Living Long Island seeing opposite here.
More people acting pandemic completely gone.  winning!

or whatever Fuck get 4chan get start trend wearing masks Libs stop wearing them. deaths going up. lying? clearly tending down. wrong you? daughter‚Äôs best friend raised grandmother mom refused grow child chose toxic men instead.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: way, calculations U.S. 42% increase number covid deaths last 7 days compared previous 7. decreasing every week since mid-April. I've watching ABC news lately, seem report lot hospitals within hot spots. No, sound like normal standards care, best knowledge really possible distinguish Covid non-Covid chest X-ray alone, even CT conclusive. country/region in? admitted hospital? far right Karen

Hmm. Yeah, pretty amazing. zero getting them. Who‚Äôs ready school? boggles mind McConnell wants give employers immunity infections happen work. protections worker? Guaranteed time worker becomes sick? Lol know wear mask along. looks like Darth Vader. continuously adjusting projections based new data. See latest Tweet today: Holy shit fatality rate seriously around 8%‚ÄΩ Worse, many get symptoms, really feel like big deal most. many women could *pay*

FIFY buy amazon, someone else making money could raking in! seem silly me, great fundraising branding opportunity him. Plus could sell ""triggering libs"" complying silly mask rules using pro Trump messaging. explains Facebook feed.

Dumb argument. Texas board education buys many books, change curriculum, states use publisher

""Once every decade, highly politicized Texas State Board Education rewrites teaching textbook standards nearly five million schoolchildren. comes textbooks, happens Texas affects nation whole. Texas one nation's largest textbook markets one state decides books schools buy rather leaving local districts, means publishers get books approved count millions dollars sales. Further, publishers craft standard textbooks based requirements biggest buyers. result, Texas board power shape textbooks children around country read years come""

PBS doc called saw construction worker wearing one (around neck) day. flabbergasted. Idk think people vote mail. issue conservatives can‚Äôt control votes. can‚Äôt close polling stations. can‚Äôt suddenly wink wink nudge nudge conversation voting machines broken need maintenance urban areas.

Then again, lived Florida years earned doctorate. took 3-4 visits DMV get driver‚Äôs license transferred new state register vote. Also, I‚Äôm brown. Every time went, documents, literally said forged papers lease wasn‚Äôt proof residence nonsense. read first thought was

You didn‚Äôt say *how* enforcing though. it‚Äôs also like super picky. 50% efficacy cause major side effects. 3 hit it, would great humanity. well one factor may matter is, hospitals get bigger push testing, AKA someone ICU get 24 hour testing someone showing popup gets 2 weeks.  guys fuck president wearing mask something worthy news? obvious people wear prevent spreading?

When mentioned something similar beginning pandemic (and still sometimes...), would get ""Whataboutism"" answer...


Comparing helps, unless want hear bad things are... Somebody pinch me, bad dream?

-official motto 2016-2020 saw first hand actually taking counteractive measures like NY suppressed numbers, almost two months spikes hospitals finally overwhelmed. January buddy, vote November still wait January new president take authority :( bad trolling  It‚Äôs sad even that, can‚Äôt sit around reddit blames 1 side, side that‚Äôs even responsible delaying bill 2 weeks could passed less that, even amendments. 

Do you? author drawn correct conclusion single anecdotal data point, vaccine may solve covid-19 problems either.

I skeptical case. I'd worry flute tuba, since blowing across opening instead thru 18 feet tubing thru valves collect spit, point still stands.  we're sick winning  close friend 20 years remove life whole pandemic. heartbreaking ignorant naive reacted whole thing, back April. Governor Ducey couple days ago announced 50% fire capacity allowed INSIDE restaurants press conference. basically it. mandatory stay home anything, recommendations I'm sure people follow...
And 50% order basically already done last month. Don‚Äôt ever drive. You‚Äôre willfully putting people risk getting behind wheel. fine jailed so. Florida May shit show right now, there‚Äôs genuinely kind hearted people taking pandemic seriously taking precautions. Also, area I‚Äôve seeing way mask usage. saw 2 people without masks publix day, huge step seeing 2 people *with* masks publix like 2 weeks ago Oh goodness. Helping right term here. preventing harm. Communism trying tell master's William Mary? Congrats? prove anything beyond willingness give money. NAILED IT! Here's problem line thinking: first all, said before, death rates. many people hospitalized age groups? many facing long-term permanent damage bodies recovering? 

Also, need keep mind death rates known lag virus people sick several weeks months dying. know true scope coronavirus deaths, know cases 18-29 age range rising rapidly, logic tells us also see rise deaths well Hundreds kids coming something result covid doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs harmful flu.

How come conclusion? really. massive global vax campaign regular doses could eliminate it, everyone would take vaccination. yeah...we're fucked  Let's get schools open start exposing teachers, school staff, students, parents, grand parents, bus drivers, etc. double number!! /s That's ok. covid likes masks. D‚Äôoh indeed. truth way know going lasting consequences pandemic.

We know end, possible know deep economical social damage country. speak, middle match teams score fail several times yet.

We know sure either possible lasting effects virus human body, incidence seriousness.

We know even true picture pandemic , difficult track keep reliable data real time, know develop next months. take years understand really happening right now.

This uncertainty uncomfortable, guess many people tries rationalize ways avoid confronting it. end day, uncertainty surest thing moment. Please Seventh-Day Adventist.


My youngest brother reciting conspiracy theories early last week. changed subject since then. can't connect ideas trying convey. China 30 times imported cases Europe/America ""the way around""? saying South Korea 30 times imported cases China? 

Either way come conclusion indication China lying see remotely connected. context numbers? many people came China Europe total? Despite China people either Europe America, account tiny fraction imported cases. clear indication number actual cases China much smaller Europe/America

It might mean less people travel China Korea. really hopeful July August would end turning point back normality. Turns might correct, everyone else except United States. 

BTW, anyone (not person whose comment I'm replying to, apologies hijacking it)on anti-mask advocating businesses schools open soon possible: fuck you. People follow twitter knew early January life change us. One Nassim Taleb. medical institutions puppets wrong continue wrong. People like Fauci completely failed American people held accountable. Quick someone tell looks handsome way. Maybe stroking ego help. timeline again?  We're lepers now. Thanks trump. Florida's fudging numbers while. one woman came forward blow whistle ordered fudge numbers. 

Then look actual reported deaths things notice odd spikes things like flu, pneumonia, deliberately attributing covid. 

It's probably going take forensic data analysts 3 5 years piece together real numbers Florida. tough call. begged stay home smart enough understand huge risk. live TX state government full republican hacks who've also pushing us go jump start economy. I've outside maybe dozen times 3 months never without mask. 

I feel comfortable putting blame GOP politicians media alt media fact situation whole spiraled control. saying governor responsible individual deaths attempt negate individual responsibility make good decisions. would feel comfortable assigning blame leaders cases compel people like teachers return non essential work get sick though. Plus even it‚Äôs true got re-infected one patient. may weak system also don‚Äôt know much viral load plays. second infection could heavy dose young adult. sure it‚Äôs possible get reinfected get slightly different strain one dude doesn‚Äôt mean applies everyone. 

Though still possibility researched better understood prepare needed. say yet people keep going regardless. trending Arizona? moving average gone down. work? number cases matter, deaths do! deaths counted corona deaths corona died! What's record cases set day state? assume NY set point months ago?  don‚Äôt actual response you‚Äôve resorted leftist buzzwords. think largest economies going fine. also displaying German, Chinese, Japanese Indian exceptionalism? Large economies obviously resilient. UK happens one them. [Here](http://edsuom.com/covid19/US.png) plot nationwide reported cases U.S. yesterday‚Äôs New York Times data. I‚Äôve re-running curve fit updating plot ten-parameter nonlinear model every day so. Look accurate fit been; less 2% error past eleven weeks. model even account weekly variation caused reporting agencies catching weekend backlogs. 

*Four million* reported cases August. CDC directory Robert Redfield said late June ten times many actual cases reported. one ten Americans dangerous virus bodies, insignificant number long-term damage result.

Are sick winning yet, sick? Oh cool feigning ignorance. Look yourself. People like believe anything people link call fake news. agree. easy say problem still met person that's gotten it. Especially isolating friends ignoring rules still case free. get jealous risky know, may us witnessing natural selection. another species watching us, would see humans following protective measures less fitness. would likely due condition preventing compliance could medical, social, form intellectual impairment. Similarly anti-vaxxers risk lives offsprings' lives due intellectual impairment blocking disrupting critical thinking, learning, resulting cognitive dissonance. 

TL;DR: stupid bad fitness. even holds every age group distinguish. Look graphs.

This probably mostly due harvesting effect, i.e. people bound die soon died earlier (yes, I'll sure get lot downvotes statement). interesting see long effect lasts much compensate COVID-19 death toll. see graphs too.  Normally go war, devastate foreign countries &amp; waste lot cannon fodder every couple years keep population growth within limits.
 
Now there's Covid-19: great, cheap, innocent convenient way get rid people! Think pensions, veteran payments, Medicare etc. saved! flats houses free &amp; market soon - housing crisis solved! jobs freed Covid victims: Job crisis solved! Obese ppl especially endangered? Obesity crisis solved!

Korean CDC also posts updates English. Doomers around must magic crystal balls. Even top scientists don‚Äôt know this! Scientific America published piece covid transmission BLM protests versus transmission types gatherings. used data number studies--I dug several post links below. studies seemed show group, BLM protesters tended come protests low covid positive rate, may attributed willing adherence covid restrictions protests. People gather primarily social reasons (disney world visitors, example), opinion, less likely adhering covid restrictions--if cautious, go Disney middle pandemic one country's hotspots hospitals overflowing FEMA sending refrigerated morgue trucks. true, believe, anti-mask protesters. guess less compliant away protests too, therefore likely carriers virus. real testing program, could actually test theory. (My husband helps make Abbott 5 minute tester white house uses... reason test results taking days even week come back.) saw South Carolina‚Äôs Governor Nick Saban tried that. Vast majority countries good covid data. followers spewing hot garbage twitter saying masks required hospital. ""all reflexive reaction scary media makes liberals wear outside hospitals."" Ferguson looks majestic dives in. Remember said even sure kids catch transmit there's real danger them. full shit. Ah yes classic whataboutism reply Rod Wave performed *last year* crowd Florida Twitter Reddit virtually silent. Anything Trumps control suspect Okay, know takes 137,000 dead Americans Trump something right. 

Remember November! Hey stupid piece shit stupid pieces shit latch onto feel slightly less worthless. government would least support fund schools open safely and/or support infrastructure online mixed online/offline class. well providing support families kids actually risk. ... yes, would trusting.

Like - without even saying kind health concerns - without plan support students teachers safely, say b/s. find way neutralizing Covid-19 air people tested blowing tube...

Scientists already know virus lingers air several hours. That's going infect people administering tests, stand spot.

It also entirely possible next person line tested could exposed exhaled air infected person tested them.

They need procedure clear air immediately someone tests positive breath test.

There go, Scientists... figure little hickup good go! think anyone deserves get sick die this, would've taken lot President wearing mask public get anti-mask people wear one. massive issues tho, considered viable option. basically solution throws ball teacher/staffs court, threatens lives teachers/staff, also families wish wrong Sad big news would rather live car family. Actually, wouldn‚Äôt first time. Anyone family they‚Äôd ok living lucky probably doesn‚Äôt know lucky are. meds?

Now reversed. Thanks, too. founder anti-semite? Trump soon - ""I gotta tell ya. believe amount masks I've got. number huge. probably masks people heard of. Really, absolute best ones. N95? like N1000."" Hes right know. black plague dissapeared. WW2 dissapeared. every problem gets solved, reach end one way another Nope, mostly happens due cytokine storm. It‚Äôs like baby taking first steps reality. He's late masks wrong applaud wearing one public. Hopefully first step unwinding one biggest political blunders US history. literally came fact wears makeup want people seeing smudges mask. 

if someone gave black mask back March, 10s thousands people may died.

I dead serious people still get beginning pandemic try avoid gatherings adjust lifes. sooner sooner able back normal. that's easy that... Tanzanian president proved fake!? I‚Äôve reading comments here, honestly horrified went r/pics (after reading people still struggling post-Covid issues) someone said regards Disney World opening back give let people spread virus.

 wind making money facebook selling data. pandemic over, calculation CFR deaths divided deaths+recoveries (aka total cases point).

Right enough data know CFR certainty whatever number used going rely certain assumptions detecting cases, detecting deaths, cases die 3 week lag, etc.

We know 'long haulers' undiagnosed cases survive well 'long haulers' undiagnosed cases die well lot newly infected people unknown outcomes actual CFR calculation could well approximated deaths divided deaths+recoveries method using assumptions.

Lies, damn lies, statistics - Mark Twain getting caught part plan? THIS! correct answer.

I hope week improves. Makes sense. frontline doctor friends haven‚Äôt seen many kids, specialties aren‚Äôt Pediactric. little evidence suggesting airborne significant vector transmission except certain situations indoors

I mean else explain Asia places like Canada contained without airborne precautions. Surgical masks limiting tables tables 8 much prevent airborne transmission yet worked Asia Canada masks public recently contained also support airborne significant vector transmission

Heck nurses doctors using surgical masks droplets precaution get significant infections work

My wife working covid19 positives months surgical mask face shield along staff none gotten work. airborne, lot would've infected Why, happens December? pity gets kind care victims won't. feel same.

What don‚Äôt seem acknowledging lack masks hcp. reserves empty, public already buying medical grade ppe either hoard price gouge, hospitals states engaging bidding wars, healthcare workers quitting due working conditions. wasn‚Äôt normal situation. proper federal government would masks increased production. proper federal response provide healthcare workers enough ppe wouldn‚Äôt get sick die rates did.


If overall government response adequate, healthcare workers others front line wouldn‚Äôt scrambling ppe masks would distributed public. early March, benefit telling asymptomatic people wear masks strong consequences removing masks hospitals.

I‚Äôd like live universe opinions person extensive medical background decades experience diseases/viruses public aspect far weight tv economist. shouldn‚Äôt even contest tv economist shut fuck up.

So ask listen tv economists advice, answer ‚Äúwhat advice? thought someone flushed toilet‚Äù. one thing I'll challenge with, however, complete abolition capitalism answer. see Russia North Korea much prevent climate change.

Russia capitalist country since early 90s.

Here's reality. Soviet Union way eliminating homelessness, guaranteeing food everyone, providing jobs everyone. made outstanding gains. US started Cold War destabilize Soviet Union CIA ensured collapse.

The Soviet Union fall bad. fell US declared war every country attempts abolish capital-ism.

North Korea's problem US. [North Korea adequate fishing rights public waters, allowed import fuel, they're prohibited selling labor resources, sanctions restricting tourism revenue, countries stolen wealth private North Koreans, North Korea allowed even sell lot essentially blocked North Korea every tool survival. nuclear power program imports fuels.

This course looks bad so, instead, point poor North Korea without political analysis North Korea poor.

In fact, there's single commun-ist country collapsed own. US actively seeks destroys countries pursue it. 

But that's neither there. I'm suggesting abolish capital-ism luxurious forms economy are. I'm saying we've lost hope halting climate change current economic system. cannot stop commercial-ism enough halt it. cannot regulate greed enough stop it. time do, end I'm telling need be.

I really care sustainable think is. want prevent human extinction, suggest figure anything short fail. gets golf rules [Kim Jong Yea nuts man. thing that's extra stressful watching rest country also feels like almost take breath relax time bit time feels like disaster right horizon ready spread back us states. that's coupled burning anger like country watched us suffer took precautions, use time prep nothing ppl left right lack preparation come back burn house back we've finally got embers.

Chapter 7 probably people think think bankruptcy. That's liquidation entity pay debts (selling house pay mortgage, basically).

Chapter 11 restructuring company debts. 


Trump filed Chapter 11 multiple times not, knowledge, Chapter 7. mind saying someone second line something means you‚Äôre saying someone owns something? 

I get saying doesn‚Äôt sit well that‚Äôs fine, nothing owning anything anyone. guess what? one thinks less wearing it. worn start, actually took threat seriously, thousands people would dead. Probably double that. problem? pissed live country allows free speech consequences pissed getting paid enough government aggressive? oppose much Russia wants happen.

Not really sure would look like need something protect faculty Looks good him. year ridiculous. problem though didn‚Äôt change mind.

He admitted lied it. collected reports percentage population antibodies, excess Mortality data determine IFR 1%. Wow never thought like that. right. US budget balanced twice last 40 years democratic president (Clinton). Somehow Republicans stolen narrative balanced budgets austerity, really blow actual budget special wartime funding seems happen every single year. Thanks insight. easy choice. one make pandemic worse. Nothing else matters get virus control keep control. Yeah, I‚Äôve got brainwashed Fox News dad (I‚Äôm 42 he‚Äôs 72). thinks everything leftist conspiracy make Trump look bad (like needs anyone besides look bad). read news story news story asked heard stories, said No. course not. Later finds I‚Äôm homeschooling kids school year asks *think* it‚Äôs going get bad felt need quit job that. said *know* bad. 

And deep hope I‚Äôm wrong virus ‚Äúmagically‚Äù disappear, right means whole lot people going die. interesting number me. fucking assholes like Elon Musk dearth right-wing commentators Well-Akcshually-ing number deaths specifically coronavirus vs people co-morbidities died already exacerbated condition. pandemic effect people catch it, overwhelms infrastructure usually already strained. important number total number deaths *that could avoided* total failure leadership dealing pandemic. number looks like could add 10-20% top total confirmed Covid19 deaths. mean get herd immunity it. think made pandemic end? *keep* herd immunity, certainly got it. dentist using pulse ox! South doesn‚Äôt need hurricane right now. No. People still would worn masks. know plenty folks left wear too. Maybe need find exactly governor said, opinion different taking calculated risk. Jesus fucking way SARS2 care... American dream really anyone work hard catch break. absolutely stop closing beaches parks zoos campgrounds. need make people feel like prisoners stop spread Covid, need get people active nature-while social distancing, course. Stupid question but, videos madness hospitals America? months ago werent nearly many cases, videos trucks full bodies, hallways hospitals full covid patients, mass graves NYC, etcetcetc.

Now twice bad there's videos found anywhere? going on? Shouldnt internet flooded kind videos? sure would helpful proof people dont believe real dont understand mask mandatory not. According CDC around 10 real infected every 1 confirmed infected (mostly mild/asymptomatic cases get confirmed). means real figure like 10%. 

Now, lets say virus really long term effects brain even mild patients. mean like 2% infected get it, like 25%. 2.5% entire USA population, 8 million people, permanent neurological problems virus *already*. sheer economic societal impact 8 million people neurological complications going impossible comprehend. going get worse time goes on.

Now, say ""well evidence that"". Sure, take chance? know neurological complications happen coronaviruses. far gone conclusion. went sleep mode. comes back wiggle mouse, really shut down. Trump culling insurance industry's expensive liabilities. Wall St cackling glee. free 6 years. Also really shows friends many even notice it. small circle friends family apart go team. 20k tests per day ohio alone.

Only 4-6% positive. Seems like total waste testing legally 

i'm that, would legal basis?

disney i'm sure set waivers anyone stupid enough brave packed theme park always plausible deniability point facts (a) florida case loads wazoo, anyone infected going disney could've caught somewhere else (b) state government specifically sanctioned reopening always pass buck shit goes south. administrations sars1, Ebola, H1N1. time chinese flights re-routed handful airports, wasn‚Äòt follow passengers. travel advisories, censored White House. remember man saying idea contagious, tested positive early cruise mad one even told him. later county health department official go airport personally stop positive person traveling. Nothing makes reset like good blow bottom. Yeah, language vague best this. lot folk know heavily looking hopes pressure already burdened school system offering distance learning opportunities, despite fact distance learning spring go well attendance abysmal best. China probably this. cause arrogant, narcissistic asshole leader went swung little around. we're paying price. need vote soon. Loads them. particular, anything went pandemic prior 19th century. think pandemics ended vaccination? US didn‚Äôt ‚ÄúJack shit‚Äù went lockdown. Many states simply decided done far early. Also, US homogeneous picture COVID. NY, positivity rate steady 1% deaths tapering incredibly low numbers. phased reopening plans dial back point needed. Masks worn nearly everyone area surrounding. Tests easily available. Air con helping... 100% population freedum! Instructions unclear, dropped tea water mistake Asking real questions here

She said actually pretty empty, assume speedpass great buy p*ssy! Socialist now? Weak. Sad. everything traced back operate we're getting shit politicians. politicians elected Americans, situation first place? Well that‚Äôs cesspool learned posts don‚Äôt need revisit. Thanks. anyone show Trump expected mask usa colours. everyone using dark blue black. &lt;= would fit music video though..... Basically imperfect cannot see it. parents friends never hard conversations us blithely ignorant someone live us daily points flaws. That's rookie numbers! Come US, get 10%!

Their principle shared window unit difference used room windows  1% still small part population. logistic growth model, 1/2 population infected infection rate slows naturally.

(fortunately, model suitable many reasons) Honestly countries suffered heavy deindustrialisation ever since entered EU. Europe actually subsidised countries stop producing goods. clear cut.

About Germany, country economic troubles 2000s EU helped quite bit, I'm mistaken. Again, clear cut, motivation grievances, contrary.

Although I'm happy EU things change. I'm hopeful former likely industries come back austerity policies Germany also lives with.

Not really. current pandemic response is, unlike one GFC, yet focused austerity. However, would foolish think / take place. think sustainable economic cuts, thing going overboard austerity hurt long run, problem know that, then, told country courts something it?

But assumed this. Honestly, worded like that, really sound bad all. Yeah prefaced 3 time, early 90s think, yeah time. since bothered looking. we've learnt Texas completely utterly fucked economy point. cared economy would close down.

It's pure ego that's driving this. Right forgot protests really move that‚Äôs Abbott‚Äôs defunding police Floyd protests. cares *so much* people don‚Äôt vote think. 

The guy gleefully carried water Trump became incredibly toxic continue so. That‚Äôs takes exert power him; bunch dead people cases raging control. think that‚Äôs guy swayed protest goes thinks? election year him, might right, wouldn‚Äôt done this. he‚Äôs secure position happily told everyone disagreed fuck off. ever loving fuck commenting for? reading exchange two like trying get information 4 year old (you're 4 year old scenario). James Cameron Already raised bar once. Trump sink low, think Cameron would able again. Welcome back dead, live on, dude! Finally!! fuck one get news? think call somebody say ""I've Corona 4 months symptoms never went away. used healthy enough play basketball three hours row get asthma attack carrying groceries stairs."" really think anybody news station gives shit I'm going through? guest

Be guest

Then get covid 19 test

Tie mask around face cherie

Let clorox rest. wondering that.

In Japanese media covering (such Yahoo News), comments seen mention visiting hospital time likely *required* mask, otherwise would never used one one time simply publicized without sufficient context.

This would make sense Trump's first publicized visit medical center. anyone know case? Needing little presidential logo mask fruity Hundreds thousands deaths later... Yeah literally nothing typed. gonna even try reply stupidity So, Covid causes insane amount clotting.

Wear damn mask, safe people! comment history interesting. sick something days spring, I've battling pericarditis ever since. I'm 20s first time ever heart issue. Makes wonder Whether testing works lot technique used people performing swabs. they're done experienced people false negative rate would relatively low, really possible know whether they're properly.

Still, one false negative crowded party would cause lot problems. 

There definitely parts NYC like Corona may well level heard immunity though. Supposedly urgent care (CityMD) 69% people Corona tested positive antibodies pretty crazy. COVID19 hit Corona super hard March/April entirely surprising. ever end can‚Äôt fix stupid. Personal responsibility thing. Following lemmings cliff politician said okay make someone else's fault get infected. Since start trusting politicians? Whenever happens align want believe. death statistic mean ""you clear"".

Yeppers. Wednesday 15th mark five months debilitated long term covid. also birthday, yay.

Waiting hear results pulmonary function test, though problems breathing tip shit iceberg symptoms. doctor said could take 3-12 months even non-hospitalized covid patients fully recover ""some probably permanent damage"".

And bad news coming no/waning immunity, could get (I'm weak enough, doubt would survive it). want step anyone's *personal liberties* hoping everyone wears masks washes fucking hands...

But sure. Everyone worked home. Sociopaths aren‚Äôt close anyone think prick. also think aware prick trying redeem himself.

And we‚Äôre still consenting continued rule it‚Äôs totally within citizen‚Äôs power remove he‚Äôs done. Super easy, happens allllll time. Dude, watch video? must 1,000 camera shutters going one clip. wants people see mask, doesn‚Äôt want answer questions engage press. It‚Äôs called photo op. Ok, bud.

I wish family well! Yes. Speedy, easy lockdowns robust TTI way (unless one lucky experienced ones already infrastructure place skip lockdown step - South Korea example.)

Vs cargo cult lockdowns 2nd lockdowns disaster. Much sunbelt may need lock again, harder smarter. lockdowns costly - psychologically socially well economy - incalculable tragedy resort failure. Panhandle Florida. definitely confirm. county mask ordinance, enforced way. still see plenty people without masks. Honestly do? live county everything closed (no bars indoor reataurants, gym) cases going anyway month now. people know met anyone besides outdoor distancing briefly 4 months. would ok another 2 months make sure like Europe everyone respecting know going on... looks like working I'm disappointed. Sure, it‚Äôd easy. us could afford to, is. fact matter tens millions _can‚Äôt_ afford that. millions stupid stubborn even consider thought ‚Äúblindly obeying government.‚Äù false negatives?(is thing?) ‚ÄúHe said it‚Äôs good wear hospitals, doesn‚Äôt mean need everywhere, time.‚Äù Yeah really like people basically mocking getting sick. masks, seems like felt county actually supply masks people trying enter government buildings.

That said, definitely element time important pandemic voting measure slowing things probably good public health either. sense probably still wrong thing even intentions good. think anybody celebrate poor guy getting sick. Belgium, minister education decided work color system. matter bad virus gets, we'll always physically go school four days week ""children spread virus""

I've felt safe teaching home. surrounded kids constantly couch, sneeze, lose bodily fluids talk about.

My pupils teens autism way. even deny virus can't physically see it. unthinking man claim 1% it‚Äôs likely 10x shown antibody tests‚Äîwhich also huge false negative rate don‚Äôt even screen t-cells, meaning it‚Äôs probably much higher 10%.

Yes... hundreds people Reddit saying much since first started refusing wear masks I‚Äôm Tualatin. commons quite restaurants outdoor seating it‚Äôs generally packed.

 Meanwhile working Portland see tons masks South Park Blocks generally far less crowded park Tualatin. really age thing. people going coronavirus parties mostly 20s 30s. honestly....what expect people put trump office finished doubling losing, actually going done entire time now? February/March student asking questions Covid. worried going get die. really worries survivor's guilt many children may face year. reality many CHILDREN may blame possibly infected teacher caused get sick possibly die.

I going lie, terrified going back. worried could die, makes worse knowing one students could blame themselves.  Troll They‚Äôre right-wing bubble, it‚Äôs know Thanks Trump. also convert janitors servers doctors nurses?

That's quite rough, can't find reason feel bad person. I'm sorry. people watched news, seeing people suffer hospitals , dying lonely death, maybe think hoax little late idiot. thinking Americans backward....i reside middle east... see single person without mask....even children. Wearing masks enforced business owners... police general public
And everyone happy that
Not that...but temperature reading mandatory entrance every store Yes!!! know women vocal kids NEED go back school .... say get back work teachers too. (Implying teachers lazy)

When asked they‚Äôre concerned virus, say kids don‚Äôt get kids aren‚Äôt vectors.

Ugh! ever gonna detail ingenious plan you‚Äôve apparently cooked up? major decline western civilization. least Goldman-Sachs balls break McConnell one, issuing public statement another round lockdown way save economy point. Or, since days ago, point. know singing spreads Several employees badly assaulted killed responsibility try get people wear masks leave. think really fall them? must seething inside. county mostly workplace outbreaks, resulting sporadic community spread. Newport fairly small town seafood plant hundreds cases want Mike Pence President? That's get Mike Pence President.

Trump actually bad. country saved incompetence. Put someone knows they're position, level corruption, gets whole lot worse. student history, I'm nervous violence think last resort.

I used feel way too. late, I've thinking, maybe violence way. But, calculated violence, might start toppling dominoes opposed indiscriminate violence collateral damage. thinks makes sense, later say ""i weared mask, fualt people wearing became infected"". Good brother. children.

Spoiled, defiant, upset children. That‚Äôll show them. love bragging great results basic cognitive test. One would hope person controlling nuclear codes could identify outline animal. we‚Äôre still consenting continued rule it‚Äôs totally within citizen‚Äôs power remove he‚Äôs done.

You're snarky that's exactly works. Everyone votes someone wins seat set duration vote again. complicated difficult understand I'm sure hard time understanding this. Pence Governor Indiana HIV outbreak nothing 200 people became infected. consequences failure? Becoming Vice President...

They care whether live die never faced consequences comfort, know least one serological study that's conducted (hopefully) nationally representative sample. believe BC also one regions breakdown/comparison, assuming sample size ends large enough, province-specific antibody prevalence produced. fuck dipshits charge...jfc smh like, 69-79% go herd immunity? 

/sarcasm possibly study hospital worker referring to. choose stock market. second surge mostly concentrated 20-30 year olds, little stocks. chose take risk move lives. course wish would care virus, course wished trump administration dr fauci sounded alarm way earlier, however damage done. US can‚Äôt enforce strict lockdown, even mask order lots places. yes, best hope vaccine better treatment right now, current situation though, trump not, don‚Äôt want another shutdown little chance succeed anyway rules can‚Äôt really enforced. I‚Äôm even worried failed second shutdown, basically systemic changes done fix problems led failed first shutdown. Much less expected US impact since SK pretty good handle right now...

Floridians going willfully ignorant virus, hell stupid asses. Let nature take course kill whole bunch stupid people. heart goes Floridians intelligent wear masks much can. They're stuck dumbest state union. Yes. Italy, UK, Spain peaked US Smoke em ya got em...  Ummm Cali get tested free unlimited amount times. WOILD TEST FEEL BAD TEST THATS WHOLE POINT.

California nearly state months upon months. Free unlimited testing using best tests. I‚Äôve tested without feeling anything all, why? know I‚Äôm safe know nothing go wrong. wear mask, constantly sanitize everything myself, get tested often, 0% chance wouldn‚Äôt know low chance even get anytime soon.

I‚Äôve travel 5000 miles since began successfully spread gotten it. I‚Äôve gone beach, National Parks, hiking biking, grocery stores, etc.

Some people dumb die get sick Annual pass holders. survey done questions? district asked teachers thought online learning compared in-person. May. still locked cases decreasing.

Oh, district made rules Crisis Schooling couldn‚Äôt teach anything new, couldn‚Äôt grade work, couldn‚Äôt give anything positive feedback work submitted (including blank assignments), limited us specific software (Lexia &amp; Math-Whizz elementary), changed learning management system/platform twice mid-March late May. bad experience, part told teach instead mostly tech support (because wasn‚Äôt district‚Äôs department‚Äôs job least first month lockdown.)

Parents district surveyed least twice summer specific options would like school next month. Teachers district weren‚Äôt asked aspect returning group teachers created survey circulated themselves. articles suggesting 10% recovered patients ""long tail"" post-viral syndrome.

That automatically mean people going long-term ME/CFS.

As time goes on, people seem fully recovering 4 5 months. body takes huge hit virus, takes time. 
You forgot factor America‚Äôs faith Lawd plus availability hydroxychloroquine. Maybe government gave stipend everyone, argument.

But hey, worked Europe would work US?  Sounds pretty good tbh 


Dangerous good husband lost noticeable amount weight working home. works office highly indulgent food culture guess nice way put it. away that, cut calorie intake significantly past 4 months. lost little bit weight nowhere near much him. spending weekdays food oriented environment. eating habits changed much since March. bit weight loss due stopping takeout meals throwing treats basket grocery store . Using grocery delivery curbside pickup helped curtail impulse purchases helped meal planning. Again, looked like protestors wearing masks sitting still area long period time without face covering amongst strangers closer 6 feet away... serve military, family though. using example. hear you. find interesting whole push reduce outdoor gatherings/spread happened protests health officials radio silent during. stop cancer treatments lockdown chances shut elective surgeries again? Lol, know I'm going get shit on, talking to?

I would wager redditors browsing comments thread mask wearing, social distancing, quarantining folks like yourself. ""You""?

Seems bit aggressive talking (most likely) like-minded individuals. 

Not everyone anti-mask trump supporting moron, ya know. Trump said ""Maybe stop testing"" DeSantis one person said makes lot sense. mention deaths article? Ready open schools up. Yayyy

/s Negative. policy made leader health service Ireland means isolate results. Dublin, police actually visited ensured know quarantine. 

The US way get many cases. minimise problems, defeatist attitude like make things worse? Also note vaccines tested resulted significantly higher level neutralizing antibodies actually got disease. vaccine might protective actually it. Let's open theme parks!!! Fuck yourself. Hold beer Quote:

""I think made mistake. thought hoax, not.""

Those final words 30-year-old patient died Methodist Hospital San Antonio week attending so-called ""COVID party,"" according hospital. Well 2.3% nothing compared U.S.A Europes expected shrink.

Just goes show quick action, helps econmic downside pandemic.

I'm UK right beginning complete shit show, brought public attention may wear masks public places shops....

I mean come fucking hell. call stupid.

People think 1% United States small number? They're stupid. Try using diatomaceous earth. way effective method. Oh like anything Disney World thin. 5 months later  Thank God I'm Canada. I'd worried dumbass Canadians going Disneyworld bringing shit back. Good thing can't. Maybe morons could spend vacation Canada instead help economy rebound. Still MAGA mask could sell afterwards $40 homepage cultists? Real business genius here. better treatment protocols entirely dependent enough remdesivir IL-6 inhibitors sicker patients. would actually kept number hospitalizations check...there's anywhere near enough remdesivir deal cases.

And people BS treatment protocols, I've treated hundreds COVID19 cases went evolutions treatment protocol NY. reality treatment protocols mostly based medications could actually obtain. Even know IL-6 inhibitors Remdesivir best medications use going part health system protocol doses medicine.

They enough medicines state treat ***HUNDRED*** patients tens thousands patients think happen? vast majority people getting optimal treatment.

It's going NY hit super hard. We'll trials lucky people selected get better treatment, even high mortality rates they'll try save drugs sickest patients. 9000+ people get treatments probably much all. bruh, Excel clearly hate boner man know I'm going get hate misguided yet refuse accept hesitate make broad statements whether quote 'safe' kids come back school,"" Fauci told CNN.

Look, too, cherry pick relevant pieces order paint bigger picture that's actually one it. barely time educate topic, sure time go vote idiocy.

Yet plenty time attempt discredit man's entire career based misfounded contempt. cherry pick sources.

Also, funny every one comments thread 0, yet every one ""1"" implying someone downvoting mine (likely disagreeing) upvoting yours? Nice try mate. GOP steals election, try do. There‚Äôs difference ‚Äúanyone‚Äù ICU beds, lot hospitals hitting ICU capacity once. That‚Äôs bad faith argument. scary, years years medical scientific research thrown bin.... No, they'd kid taken away willfully putting danger, i.e. taking hospital mask despite health officials say despite fact hospital covid now.  I've already seen stores ask people refuse wear mask use curbside pickup. stores would rather enforce risk people get sick inside. US - people comply. Didn‚Äôt wear one weeks ago everyone like ‚Äúhe actually looks better‚Äù

Edit: wore ford plant publically update that, recently maybe since last week, discriminations donate blood ended. longer ask sexual orientation. feel reassign resouces needed, given top-down political structure. Fuck ""literally"" fuck ""context"", piece human waste. I'm Utah. There's extremely high number people idiotic masks. Even Governor suggesting hoping folks wear masks ""out kindness heart"". 

We've numbers deaths consistently go up. I'm shocked it. ""I like Florida. Everything 80's. temperatures, ages IQ's.""- George Carlin Bureaucratic nonsense. applied variance qualified, would issue. Fucking hopeless shit fuck world ""let's scream way tiny tube one another, fucking day"" Fuck ""context"". I'm going bother reading that. I'm glad wasted time bullshitting. Silver linings. Congratulations. rlly can't believe ""people"" arguing wearing fucking harmless facial covering potentially end shitty pandemic. hard wear mask make ""freedom"" issue? Stg gonna keep defending rights till mom/dad/etc. dies covid sigh  Dude. hope Florida education wherever you‚Äôre isn‚Äôt stupid. 2 Florida‚Äôs fit 1 Ca. Ca double death Florida means same. fucking stupid you?


Enroll stats class. Please. cancelled Disney subscription. irresponsible reckless. Wearing mask outdoors limited value, indoors confined space public transport wearing mask impact.

People say protests source spikes cases data really suggest that's case. mean Hong Kong protesting anyone world late far longer, even world locked anywhere going get ravaged covid spread via outdoor protests Hong Kong, they've 7 deaths believe. seem keep disagreeing cherry picked data previous comment.

I disagree claim. One need cherry-pick find outrageous statements Fauci. plentiful, easy find. actually harder find quote Fauci first-quarter 2020 that's least misguided, outright hardly think reopening schools fauci's fault considering TELLING PEOPLE REOPEN. dense you?

""The idea keeping schools closed fall safety concerns children might ""a bit reach,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases.

""""In situations problem children go back school,"" I've trying explain you, Fauci says manner things, many misguided wrong. no, people say ""How high?"" says ""Jump!"" They've learned he's might make feel better downvote every one comments, strengthen argument beyond ""MY OPINION OUTWEIGHS FACTS"" seems case here.

I'm one it. barely time educate topic, sure time go vote idiocy.

And record, I'm one posting direct quotes person question. one posting nonsense like ""He's telling people reopen."" google wherever come from? need explain you. Fuck you, piece shit.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yep, wear one go shop that's like twice 6 months. I'm usually house 3-4 hours every day walking around baby dogs wear one, stay far fuck away everyone too. dont. millions americans fault deserve better.  Plus fatigue syndrome people get, although guessing problem. Wuhan January. Sorry probably like 2 months. one could‚Äôve expected bad, countries done stop it. wear mask man's fool!

Lmao he's wearing mask now? fool. well written need ask work medical fields 100% top virus? asked I'm impressed seem knowledgeable thank information.

I'm someone living Japan following news.

I claim know facts either, hence emphasis point view anything objective unless citing something. average, maybe. look China whole. Big cities developed West European ones. Small cities like South East Asia East Europe. Country side areas like Africa.... worst part health never üò¢ want share published sources that? Every democratic country guarantees freedom travel. However, also also temporary restrictions times national crisis. Hence German states, French departments, Italian regions, Canadian provinces Australian states insisted travel restrictions regions point.

And rest developed world, US Constitution looks less useful 1 ply toilet paper point. Yes. human interest story. run time. obsession exponential growth sub hilarious. Neither cases deaths growing exponentially India. look logarithmic scale, it‚Äòs linear. Prevention. Prevention spread absolute fucking moron.

And it‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs got Covid, tested DAILY? Probably it‚Äôs possible gets Covid. fucking idiot.

As mentioned could convince followers wear masks, fucking relevant it‚Äôs direct result wearing mask fucking neck less giraffe. students going equally behind year. think anyone count students. Behind also relative perception. 
Perhaps students learn inward solitary skills typically never time for, also. Great. They're suddenly going pressing need vacation CO. bit late it?  Vote Next record coming Monday!  rest western world want live US like lead believe. deceived. Wut? wonder yanks understand rest us forget new zenith collective idiocy. War crimes, broken treaties, history full them, blah blah blah.  anti-mask, covid-party phenomenon, well played. honestly think capable. denied testing even called put two week quarantine contact tracing. said I'd come contact someone say gave number call see testing. called hospital, asked questions told qualify testing symptoms. feel like system working. shouldnt I? woman, actually american?

Because every single fuckin dude US still gets selective service registration card 18. government could decide tomorrow drag ass basic training, ya dingus.

Also, fuckin' irrelevant much?  people downvote want. airborne virus fools! said stupid, proved right. Cannnabis known emotional deficiencies. Might explain guy‚Äôs case *3 million confirmed infections probably huge number never diagnosed due lack accessible testing , lack pepper medical coverage, showing severe symptoms. He's lot good work, despite paranoia around him. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Every single country's constitutions asterisks saying times national crisis things temporarily suspended. Obviously things like ""right fair trial"" ""right cruel unusual punishment"" can't suspended matter what. there's general consensus temporary suspensions need ""reasonable justified"".

Like damn, one biggest success' EU free movement members states. Obviously that's suspended temporarily crisis. Australia put restrictions NSW Victoria 200 cases day. 2-6 days appoint 14 days staff get results Arizona positive case. restaurant shut waiting. restaurants not. It‚Äôs economically sustainable so. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* sounds similar people develop heart failure myocardial infarction. much know virus. Guess blamed themselves. :v hope bunch people tell looks super weak, wearing mask, want hear weak is. Alright well tried give reasonable reply replied like asshole. good day Need sub these. Something like r/CoronaHoaxOopsDead I've wearing mask I'm shops I've running. comfortable can't breathe properly. Yes. know stupid. I'm pretty sure Arizona Florida Texas soon enough. Florida wont hit half NY per capita death toll.

It huge shock hit 1/3rd  asked. trying fulfill dream. started week three days deaths this? Oh god fucking adorable. Okdiario tabloid Spain. Calling something better like saying FOX News respectable source information. place redneck California. Public transport jammed packed back work. 

They also put much emphasis face time offices meetings We‚Äôre never getting New York‚Äôs level, let‚Äôs real. quick someone photoshop wearing mask oval office behind desk Jurassic Park real life bring government ship Arizona's beautiful Phoenix Bay. want microchips!! enough people congregating indoors long enough, often enough, find way.

Layman well, believe case well.

The Japanese train systems (subways, etc.) begun opening windows allow air flow hopes reducing virus concentration. understand correctly, good ventilation would also help reduce viral load confined spaces, something remember cited earlier year virus spreading within Wuhan. constant insistence trials good news produce results? common. death recorded person lives. someone else pointed deaths cases NY today lower Florida. That‚Äôs don‚Äôt seem getting. situation NY improved what‚Äôs happening Florida right could entirely prevented. I‚Äôm saying lying, source this? comment thing internet find says teachers asked update wills.. would something teachers unions around country would screaming bloody murder about.. don‚Äôt know people said things lol That's saying. comparisons made need take account context. always simple directly comparing per capita rates. That's cool. Hundreds ""actual"" virologists disagree, published ""actual"" research support findings. 

The rest post ... okay, sure. (secede) mention many employers require positive tests whatever ‚Äúcorona leave ‚Äúthey anything  It'll go well school reopening Disneyworld! agree principle - least Texas, Florida, Georgia, Arizona, California, others - far high infection rate. we'd consistent stuff April, think 100% correct. Right tamp back order things. indoor space much risk right much population infected. 

I'm sure schools money implement high tech air filters either, wonder much time takes get installed. know that, still much age old patriotism, inconvenient assholes. Correct. Basically FL (and elsewhere) seems heading direction NY did, despite benefit available testing experience choose different path. 

Folks seem rather committed learn hard way. virus acts relatively consistently, 'let rip' approach failed elsewhere... Yes, maybe people follow blindly mask up. Oh, flu season ticking Trump months go least, still office. admire optimism. response someone thinking insulted condescend call sensitive, yet surprised read prior comment like that. give benefit doubt really try reading comments neutral PoV, sayin'.  Fuckry Let's look WH's record this: I've added it, I'll argue ""reasonable person"" would able pick sarcasm pretty damn quickly. Far less 9 million, obviously unrealistic 100% people get covid. actually stupid? May well close everything every winter well, unless implying 80,000 deaths per year due flu meaningless that‚Äôs covid. consistent.

Assuming deaths hit 320k March, unlikely, mean flu accounts 25% amount deaths annually comparison covid, insignificant (and probably actually like 40%). shouldn‚Äôt close risk anyone, logic? get choose what‚Äôs fair isn‚Äôt, virus it‚Äôs okay shut for? I've waiting AZ app since update Samsung :/ Maybe people learn difference ‚Äúcases‚Äù compared positives. people talk California say town. there. people. okay. Sad. What‚Äôs kind fascinating even four months, New York still sees 500-800 new infections day ‚Äî hardest hit European countries. goes show widespread virus hard root out. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Insignificant risk mean risk, sidewalk too, show person respect set good example concern risk, certainly safer it. It‚Äôs easy make fun kids try remember it‚Äôs easy live area adults around constantly stifle critical thinking empathy. can't trace this. can't.  


At max efficiency good epi might able knock 20 interviews day (and someone else needs reach contacts, easier hire new contact tracers new epis pretty easy teach) News flash, Florida got inside border wall! Wow that's pretty sad. covid journalism politically motivated, it'd nice able discuss dispassionately. 

Not criticism you, rule general. We're missing insight conversation. basically Florida 15k cases almost two weeks ago? God many must today could instant test? I'm kind shocked NBA bubble middle nowhere somewhere. Imagine lodge like Wyoming. Close visitors. Build basketball court one big inflatable tents done. ever see something think ‚ÄúI many things say this‚Äù start typing wind speechless headache? Texas verge dont doubt Yeah agreed depends company.

But I‚Äôm sure many people able refused move roles/jobs don‚Äôt like employers handling  said ""I've never told lie"" Exactly happened Southern California. kept reporting great doing... everyone decided went completely back normal.

People either 0% 100%, don‚Äôt seem ability moderate themselves. sad thing could go pretty much back normal everyone plays ball. Well added factors head late May ""never sell"" investor....realized way hell comfortable current risk picture. divested everything going trigger penalty. 


Is timing market? Maybe. rationalization stands.....SOMETHING going go sale, stocks, real estate, cars, etc wheelhouse. feel awful one opportune survival dictates choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

IMO way another massive financial meltdown either disease quickly rights massive federal financial aid given people plan developed. words, we're fucked. yeah, 3 miles lol amount sanitizer person uses home nowhere near comparable amount Disney needs use constantly sanitize entire park Well said. I'll edit it. beneficial speak absolutes. COVID-19 interested event accomplished nothing Baby boomers kept country He‚Äôs ‚Äúnever masks‚Äù, said people wearing spite signal disapproval him.   Celebrating like celebrating house fire finally died burned entire house down. sub get even worse. biggest story white woman got shot saying lives matter. 

Except conveniently leave fight started group calling people n word started pointing guns got shootout. eats healthy stays inside gets rest

What about? Says right comment he‚Äôs hospital oxygen. First off, whatever metrics CERTAIN New York City entire state New York never 799 deaths reported single day. metrics look like New York STATE deaths, New York City. New York State almost 20 million people.

And disease last 2-4 weeks everyone. usually lasts 2 weeks that's people without crazy symptoms, large portion cases. cannot imagine 12.5% New York City population infected EVERYONE city would gotten infected. Maybe million people across New York State even feels like stretch me. immediate residents house yeah would say fine, friends outside house education system might collapse enough teachers kids going school. Districts can't keep distance learning feds even giving states money, let alone schools I‚Äôm pro gap year well. 2021 needs nationwide assessment children placed learning groups based ability. age.

**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* think DC people hate situation. makes residents US, citizens. Same; would like hibernate suspend life altogether over. Literally can't take anymore. Cuomo take blame responsibility 25,000+ deaths New York had. states dont numbers. hate ""record"" like fucking game. tragedy. ""Florida tragically cases single day today 15,000 confirmed infections. Stay safe, practice social distancing, safety well others please wear mask public."" There's headline. Media needs stop treating like trying get high score. living human beings disgusts use titles like"" record breaking"" get views. That's good point. already sacrificed us economy rushed end lockdown.

Why earth would anyone think twice? What? always enjoy NFL 1:1 ratio actual game advertisement last year.

Pretty sure advertisement overtake actual game coming years. live Alabama, yesterday stuck traffic 65 south... aka interstate leads beaches. saw state tags! NY, NJ, OH, NH, TX, MA, AR... list went on. 

and several people coming states travel ban people going Alabama. kept thinking many people people may infect go back home states. 

THERES FUCKING PANDEMIC. STOP GOING FUCKING BEACH. Zero One problem - civil society, wear masks use proper hygiene. Schools open Air Filters, Hand washing, Masks, Stagared schedule, Outside classes, Open Windows - smart countries done worked! capable normal civil social responsibility.

Oh wait forgot, country thinks hoax masks like vaccines caused flat earth! Got it... Hush, junior. Well see that‚Äôs trap. People join armed forces save people eventually mission ends. helper-type compassionate people ordered combat. can‚Äôt quit, you‚Äôre killing. Statistically you‚Äôre likely killing civilians wrong place wrong time. Response ""The Duce"":..................coyote howling distance..................swirling wind dust devil...........................the pitter patter sand window pane....................... wars earthquakes mass forest fires thing going happen. People keep acting like virus unpredictable!!!

If people prepared advance virus outbreak, lot economic health problems could far better outcomes.  I‚Äôm teacher area; we‚Äôre supposed report back schools end month person classes. It‚Äôs insane. shut cases nowhere close compared &amp; I‚Äôm supposed believe I‚Äôll totally safe school 2k kids showing up? maybe DeSantis believes it‚Äôs duty possibly die, spread death others service profession. 


Shits Fucked. referring specifically comparisons made single country level, comparisons EU whole US. Whether point valid, would tired tried argue people every time said prayed something. use energy business, suppose. speaking everyone. I'm speaking HIM. really need put /s going get either praise Trumpketeers antivaxxers shit reasonable people. Deaths flux over. fudging numbers. them. Excess deaths still rising COMMON covid issues. So. ""Come in, safe here. currently offer admission tickets Covid-19. ticket, admission."" Nope. I'm arguing US time prepare. US ignored longer. EU countries cases way per capita US has.

Some US states cases US states way per capita worst EU countries. much better already image issue boorish, selfish rude. we're gross disease ridden, too. Nothing closing. Results take 7-14 days. Limited contact tracing. record daily deaths hospitalizations. numbers keep going up.

I wonder magical number deaths DeSantis need see starts something. always fearful hit US. knew great majority country take seriously, due invincible nationalist mindset America good it. 

That February. Thanks numbers. That's understand before, we're looking day per day stats historical count, right? military doctors nurses found easier go right NYC hospitals. It‚Äôs talked ton pretty common. you‚Äôre welcome :) Also, one photograph wearing mask 'so much data'... Lying ass motherfucker. Eat Shit. I've unemployment since march, school starts aug 4th. refuse hide anymore. take precautions, wear mask issued masks work need work live. appreciate concern I'm chef school, please direct concern deserve like healthcare workers forced work long hours saving lives karen refuses wear mask people gotta crowd get drink on. JFC can't believe people non-ironically believe this. Cuomo directly responsible virus ravaging state killing thousands seniors.  actually live NY definitely voting anyone party. People think Cuomo displayed great leadership watched interviews brother CNN. seen scientifically illiterate (or maybe illiterate general) leader? HARD STAY HOME??? Darth Vader good right? Got ventilator. doctor numbers? way radar recently. diagnosed 3 years ago sick 30 years. Johns Hopkins work small-fiber neuropathy. Best luck you. know going forward without lot good guidance rough, we're, end, non-run-of-the-mill medical things concerned. we've got sky-high unemployment

thanks govt cool

this place rot care. provide proof? something news media outlets would love story on. everyone feel chance reinfection? read article I'm feeling overwhelmed need help processing Earth trying knock bunch parasitic humans. think vaccine stop immune reaction. agenda OP massively editing title worry

He's damn clever ‚ÄúSlow testing dooowwwnnn, please‚Äù Agreed. feel like sort national campaign promoting healthy coping methods lockdown. Yeah, it‚Äôs perfect social contact pretty important deadly virus going around stressful, what‚Äôs alternative? message ‚Äòhey, stressful, don‚Äôt expand telehealth counselor access‚Äô really message all.  hope pray true. said, think following; 1) lab technicians finally got day months nonstop work 2)they switched Michigan model report weekend.

Regardless that, well done New Yorkers! That‚Äôs bullshit. I‚Äôm sorry :( [Dutch (link English article summary) indicates almost 90% mild cases reported issues month later (mostly fatigue shortness breath).

There's also evidence [even asymptomatic cases lung generally bad symptomatic people. Viruses actually want kill host - that's goal. Ideally, virus wants harmless cause problems host. virus new, ""know"" enough humans work cause us harm. Viruses general tend become less harmful time order spread host host without detected killing host. Killing host actually benefit virus any, evolutionary point view. Oops, gave people many rights. Yes. CDCs website exactly even trying argue? guy realizes basically mayor Jaws right? Praying help. Vote, act, protest. Nope read article, places besides Sweden.  What‚Äôs point testing, without sufficient contact tracing willingness quarantine alter policy? It‚Äôs like trying measure temperature middle forest fire? Unless you‚Äôre going actually something g data, doesn‚Äôt help?  Jesus fuck Florida, get win.

-Texas correct publishing date information March. part narrative constructed information reposted several times past week.   time right dig around little bit find articles pair something solid case I'm base top head. Thanks, also I'm moving tomorrow maybe I'll OK lol frustration fact cannot get Coronavirus control country posted comment COVID19 sub response post fact clinical study published confirmed fact masks effective protecting wearer addition protecting others.

""Common sense went window right country. Coronavirus sent ANYONE country hospital ward contagious disease would gladly worn mask without hesitation. Group Think created right followers. Mass conformity set even common sense infectious diseases masks place mind.""

I banned sub ""Low Effort comment"". always noted sub harbors lot COVID Mask deniers think ban? Take Andorra still Spain. Italy, sweden, France, UK ahead us.

Edit: Belgium. Well least Disney making money again...Bc that‚Äôs matters apparently 

/s used work gastric bypass (stomach stapling) surgeon always said ‚ÄúYou never see Willard Scott wish obese person Happy Birthday‚Äù. 

He right. watched Today Show entire life (well, fired Ann Curry) saw hundreds 100th birthday wishes, never single one obese. Cmon 'Bama, out-stupid-ize Mississippi.... 15%-16% today's results. Helping = Helping stop spread people. realize tone inflection lost text, clarifier: referring sarcastic manner idea US amongst sacrificing personal freedoms order help others (help stop spread virus others) mind boiled understanding communism is. First part semantics. Second part sarcasm. good?  Correct...my mistake reading. reading articles strain, seem sure deadly, unclear less deadly yet. Shut We're private company contracted provide dining services private Christian school yeah I'm screwed. show actual evidence this? AK-47‚Äôs illegal never known anyone life said could get AK-47.

I‚Äôm favor specifically article that's kind idea remember seeing, yeah. really wish unified message latest info...way many conflicting voices right now. Sounds right :/ Someone US might know distinctions Disney theme parks using Disneyland refer Disney World confusing. get getting defensive this, best thing irrelavent ignore comment. everything fight. That's one stupid conspiracy theories I've ever heard. Can't believe became popular. support Trump, greatest service could provide death. Well super bug like Ebola yet. Lets hope never gets like THIS. NY going get hit travelers people vacationing low numbers. Also, college students coming back, even larger risk.

A lot already paid-for residence cornell college. thats rural NY.

I think get celebrate yet. know good NY, never charge virus, dealing it. True, call PCR test results next day IIRC. take drive-thru testing stations (they converted emissions testing places COVD testing). According friend went exposed took 20 minutes. Failure looks like. Except Necessity groups Medical Masks Mandatory Checks buy basic necessities start Basic Income 2 months (everyone gets Rent Mortgage

Doesn‚Äôt look like kids starting schools physically year. 

Florida literally saying HMB NY. I'm excusing US all. think way US handling coronacrisis absolutely retarded current leadership joke also kind scary. merely saying lot travel states US countries EU, therefore would lot harder shut interstate travel shut intercountry travel.

I live less 30 minutes away German border Netherlands, yet go Germany every years. frequently go places much away Netherlands that's people know live that's stuff relevant happens. case people, apart holidays generally much reason travel internationally people.

In US people living near state borders probably really notice border, even big cities like St Louis Kansas City state border run right them. city border Georgia much different city 30 minutes away South Carolina. I'm saying state borders effect effect obviously much smaller. mean NY 1,600 deaths per million population CA 150 per million. CA spiking they've taken pretty seriously. 3 phases testing? Soooo bitter. must Florida Institut Pasteur, lead author twin studies found virus spread high school one French town six primary schools country‚Äôs March lockdowns.   Israel, virus surging again, schools every level affected. early June, 100 schools shut 13,000 students teachers sent home quarantine. notable outbreak tied middle high school: Gymnasia Rehavia Jerusalem saw 153 students 25 staff test positive. political realignment 1960s, working-class whites saw new Civil Rights legislation fled en masse Big Business GOP, cancerous nation 50 years. awful times are, I'm hoping equivalent *finally* getting bad enough go see damned oncologist. Theres big diffrence theres dead body proof crime occured vs false accusation US think many people even consider state job in

I think that's accurate? feel consider much European citizens countries. distance taxes. I'm sure 15,000 new cases today (on Sunday!) helping situation. 20K/ Day next week. think, Disney opened. South East US absolutely fucked. going America‚Äôs Chernobyl moment. Yes right! Travel advisory mandates 14 day quarantine people arriving states. Full list.

2/17/20

""If look masks buy drug store, leakage around really much protect you,"" said. ""People start saying, 'Should start wearing mask?' Now, United States, absolutely reason whatsoever wear mask."" - Dr. Anthony Fauci (2/17/20) - ""Short that, Fauci says skip masks unless contagious...""

Fortunately changed tune months.

Now regarding spread children adults. based current understanding virus. Santa Clara County fortunately playing politics acting new data:

Refer SCC guideline: 2

I neices nephews public school getting 1-2 hrs. education day via Zoom. working. work hard put daughter private school fortunately getting around 6 hrs, could see still lacking kids could loose focus.

I fine parents comfortable sending kids school attend via Zoom, rest us asses risk accordingly want kid attend school allowed attend. think obvious performance shift stay-at-homes school bear suspect quality education.

After much preparation training lab back safely working site. done. preparation scared. Don‚Äôt start left right bollocks dude

You support Trump fear deadly virus 
Right? Yes no, obviously done via zoom. said, focused manufacturing operations good deal stuff manufacturing plants pretty hard remotely. substantial amount hands work floor involved. relate COVID-19 US *not* highest per capita deaths? change *fact*? think Bible says something somewhere even fool appears wise knows speak. also shows researching diseases aren‚Äôt prevalent important. I‚Äôm discouraged see reports us scrapping coronavirus research. excited see Oxford vaccine fairs truth sayer say so? distrust anyone online principle. 

So take Yogi‚Äôs word yours. 

It‚Äôs easy say something false. nothing evidence that. actual numbers contradicted government‚Äôs, would argument. Merely saying person truthful doesn‚Äôt anything. 

So yes distrust whoever like. believe evidence. evidence evidence good enough false, consider that. 

Tere pass koi data hai? Nahi. don‚Äôt try pass opinion truth try appear virtuous. Every viral epidemic leaves people lifelong post-viral problems. Medicine neglected ignored problem long time.

Review article: Post-viral syndromes I'm sorry, yelling schools opening? literally nothing decision dude, post history would show think good idea. thanks misplaced rage. WA I'd say people selfish stupid worried economy, I've got buddy invites pool hall every weekend North Miami Beach. says big deal, flu. last week, office wanted reopen Miami, taken seriously. economy crash anyway healthcare system goes down. Hopefully manage move back north then. hope. DT seen wearing mask. announces (or even tweets) everyone wear masks, people still refuse, start wearing masks.

If starts selling red ""MAGA"" masks web site, could make lot money.  Yeah actually are. America currently possessed demons - come back exorcism. group public scientists, dubbed three musketeers, praised steering Caucasus state's successful response pandemic. 

They're actual musketeer cosplayers, hoped. Hope saved someone click.

There's also fact can't easily tell difference two (or, matter, either healthy person).

I *assume* I'm healthy I've home four months rare occasions go out, wear respirator (still possible caught delivery person, that's super likely). But, I'm walking around, can't tell difference neighbor street hosting house parties every weekend.

It's safer assume we're infected. USA total collapse now? PS /s üòÇüòÅü§î‚òπÔ∏èüò≠ Sweden? greatly underestimating Americans pride stupidity comes virus. area vast majority ignore everything meant keep people safe, gonna spread guess high school students gonna biggest issue schools. one person contagious densely packed room airflow gonna spread rapidly. odds people show symptoms still gonna end going school cause miss days make work get overwhelming worth effort catching up. That's reality someone minor symptoms still gonna end going. temperature checks gonna enforced smaller areas cause stuck everyone is.

Just like live, there's young doctors nurses directly care interact covid patients every day still go party 30+ people weekends without second thought passing bottles around.

Sell away. don‚Äôt care makes money it. 
At point it‚Äôs major win humanity. 


It would cause much trouble though. 
Imagine anyone seeing mask public. It‚Äôs going start public outrage, sadly. 

If could get president believe we‚Äôd vote pushed people wear masks safer. 

Like could one big inside joke don‚Äôt it, save many lives. 

The politicians lie time, can‚Äôt we? Mexico already closed borders USA love irony. Germans always say ""until"" mean ""by"". There's one word German. foot accelerator.

NYC around 8.4 million inhabitants reported 22,750 deaths.

That means NYC almost 0.3% *everyone* died. 

Considering everyone virus, puts conservative lower bound mortality rate population resembling NYC. No, purpose made COVID hospital Excel Centre never really used either. 

That however mean wearing face coverings. should.

I'm curious rabid deniers masks gonna say best case scenario. CDC multiple models showed fatality rates high 1%.

But top fatalities, sudden rash cases overwhelmed health care systems, directly affects us all. Flatten curve means keep hospitalizations mangable level, many jurisdictions can‚Äôt.

You want reopened economy? Mask up, social distance. Wash hands. Stay bars, clubs, large crowds. #OOF Ya poll numbers dropped. mortality rate among high-blood pressure patients reported Chinese doctors back spread widely outside China. right take leave work. I'm sad concerns ignored.

I urge anyone high blood pressure minimize risks. hope guys stay safe heart goes you. think people v0te better wake complete failure government respond appropriately pandemic? .016 mortality rate. school district 50,000 students thats potentially 800 dead kids. hope implying okay sacrifice 800 children school district? include potential Post-Covid effects health either.

edit: typo fixed That's really problem though knowledge form antibodies retained body mount secondary response. really keep antibodies around every disease process ever exposed to.

Lmao cognitive dissonance think want. Singapore shut island kill dozen unlinked cases. That's blip radar, them, big deal.

For highly dense places like Singapore Hong Kong, expected relatively high daily infections. long keep tabs infected, managed. unlinked cases blow thousands tens thousands infections.

If HK can't figure infections linked, need shut down. starts ""T"" ends ""rump probably still going win Florida November"". annoying. Shut fuck up. 13% population. 

The statistics prove black people likely charged, white people likely charges dropped myriad reasons, black people likely get convicted using circumstantial evidence, likely receive max sentences.

This guy honestly thinks virus lingering everyone's system months test positive now. complete moron take family Disney right Bullshit, management say damn near anything avoid liability covid. Good point, 34 million Americans smoke, 13.7% would change comment read; ~~Yet people completely ignore it.~~

Yet 34 million Americans smoke ignore warnings. say ""I never scared life"" anything self defense kills others tho? state loses results? live Illinois. Got tested back March, send tests local lab. believe county called back results state. hear hedge funds New York pooling profits raise enough money buy New Zealand New Yorkers someplace go that's infected.  celebrate milestone, they'll throwing parade Disney World. takes read Wikipedia quick summary republican party today origins south.

Anyone else find sad moved ranking states cases ranking deaths even fall? Heaven forfend virus plead *guilty*. here, got results next day early May. seems like hit sweet spot ‚Äúwe tests‚Äù ‚Äúcases trending downward slightly.‚Äù guess demand wasn‚Äôt high back area. would work? Punish them? sick ones?

How prove anything wrong? People regularly catch covid even using correct precautions.

What asymptomatics? Yeah..people usually don‚Äôt die day two testing positive.. number certainly increase next 10-14 days Fauci step down, create ""shadow taskforce""

He'll hired back new year, wants Lol fucking point view even look from? sucks pandemic really drive home ridiculousness healthcare system. Die go broke, bitches. So, like stupid kill themselves. ok. No. one else thinks that. thank asking. Yes I've googled. 

Anyway still arguments it. 

I'm virologist medical professional I'm repeating someone told reason lie. Maybe public papers reason lie? know. we'll see time. go beach everyday 7am leave 9am. mostly swim least 100 feet anyone - usually fisherman two farther beach. said, today fell asleep sun woke around 10 holy crap. Large groups people everywhere, parking lot filling up, kids running around...and one wearing masks. NY going get hit hard again. Pool testing new, efficiency improved  911

Nobody denies 9/11 happened, circumstances shady hell beginning end. Please lump Sandy Hook hoaxers people getting charged thousands dollars supposedly ""free"" test. much science money would suggest opens windows entire ride, wears mask sits furthest away driver. What's scary know guy responsible aggregating submitting data, 15,000+ record DATA 4-5 DAYS OLD! We're pretty fucked, people, unless things change quickly. ""Byrd, also lupus, diabetes asthma, died June 26 hospitalized""

Uhhh headline ""extremely unhealthy 61 yr old teacher dies getting sick"". Like acknowledge 5-10% average populous might severe reaction getting walking pneumonia... flu...etc would killed her. read title WOW FUCK OMG FUCK self don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs case North Florida. Unless people blatantly disregarding they‚Äôre supposed doing; wouldn‚Äôt surprise either, unfortunately üò¢ Exactly!!! Yeah, there's way hell vocabulary would produce speech like that. know Trump 50 words command none appear speech. old friend? Overweight? health issues prior this? 2+2=5 Blame game, wake America? Snake oil salesmen nation, right start pretty much. 

No wonder there's much stupid there. Quality information scarce, competing droves misinformation terrible leaders. 

We need generations citizens grow environment quality education, quality information, quality representation ever want grow.

What's going right direct reflection headless mindless we've become, due neglect greed lust power.  __WE‚ÄôVE 5-7 MONTHS PREPARE THIS__ I'm sure DeSantis cases still climbing. think interested Disney opening specifically turns out. 

I personally think risky, appears attempting mitigate risks. say Bars/Restaurants. amazing vaccine development timetable reduced, potential selling several billion doses motivation? 

I wish could legit add /s that. think mentioned. lag getting infected succumbing disease.

Actually, look worldofmeters, shows beginning spike deaths. past 3 days averaged 100 deaths 

If anything like New York peak, Florida heading towards 500+ deaths day soon. Los Angeles probably similar situation. Yeah, serious... serious? Oh price going go dramatically matter happens. Overhead costs risen significantly new procedures place COVID, flights historic lows, recover years pre-COVID levels, people also want middle seat open. 

The question much they'll climb point. nurse testing place wearing mask properly? Wtf? Quick question: obese? need see surveys worded. felt trapped saying ""I want come back"" choices given were1.) want come back. 2.) immunocompromised--with doctor's note-- family member 3.) taking early retirement. spin survey 90% teachers want come back! kind horrified read local paper. Uh, no. single mom need job. terrified very, stressed come back two weeks. report back, want to. capacity. I'm currently home sick 90% sure mild case COVID get test I'd stand line 4 6 hours outside heat stroke inducing temperatures. I'm physically capable current state I'd hesitant even sick (I burn super easily).


So I've got COVID, going counted. know several others opted testing similar reasons. would end worse shape put instead resting home. one less credit White House Correct. thinking 12-18 months would safe move separate houses. hospitals overunned though? Don‚Äôt forget Disney opened too. It‚Äôs gonna get lot, lot worse. ships used much due logistical problems get patients to/from ships without contaminating everything, HUGE deployment Reserve National Guard soldiers NYC. ran hospital Javits sent people various hospitals city. I'm sure total numbers, know Guard alone least 3,600, Reserve Officer know said biggest Reserve deployment ever one time. Canadian provinces voluntary app already contract tracing, working one.

However useful population installs it. think crossed bridge 134,000 Americans died gotta remember military generally leans right ‚Äî big military budget (meaning pay) republican thing. Fox News thing base TVs. lot still think it‚Äôs hoax least overblown. 

I retired last year, wife still active duty. We‚Äôre stationed AZ. base fuck combat covid hardest hit state country. Offices full-manned, still bullying folks go work even sick, (enforced) mask requirements except bx commissary, zero time quarantines people who‚Äôve forced travel pandemic. It‚Äôs completely laughable commanders come spewing feel good family first garbage, behind closed doors encourage first line supervisors ensure one gets ideas time working home. really depressing Japan worked hard contain virus. 125 million people island Americans can't even wear masks. I'm shit. I'm stating excatly son's school district already emailed parents already happening 3 weeks sports. Well man loves military welfare military, man loves America people make America. love concepts possibly untethered reality convenience factors.  Underlying health condition hole number White House staffers must got ol‚Äô C-19! something health authorities track? discredited told everyone wear masks effective even though knew were. Trump's stooge Surgeon General. CDC too. Actually kinda lie us wherever want. don‚Äôt think works way. followers called virus hoax months said one time rally (and many still do). mean Trump clearly acknowledged real virus million ways since February followers said it‚Äôs hoax lib friends Facebook feeds, lot couldn‚Äôt swallow pride walk back. You‚Äôll large portion population die taking mask wearing seriously lays Trumps hands even little euro. Everyone right wrong fauci wrong about???? 

If recommended, would much better whatever batshit strategies government actually taken. already costs twice much shirt bought 10 years ago. pretty much everything else. wages sure hell double. get pegged pneumonia often not. extremely likely caused COVID-19. CHINA! -Potus

/s good mayor. Probably both. Probably also 12 year old understand camaraderie maybe thinks gay personally get science information Jared Kushner, he's clearly universal genius, look peaceful middle east is! I'm going back twitter now......  know!!!!!! Unfortunately problem get worse virus continues spread demand goes up.

In mean time, needs sort way tested held accountable quarantining awaiting results. agree. It‚Äôs shitty situation. I‚Äôm pulling Oxford‚Äôs vaccine &amp; overly optimistic idea virus die fall. jury republicans judge, so... Liar. interested absolving tragedy unleashed country ignorance, hubris, anti-science rhetoric. believe actually continue wear mask. One time last two months, Trump trashed mask wearing, undermining government's advice. suggested Wall Street Journal people wore masks show disapprove him. warned give press ""pleasure"" seeing face covered public. He's toured country barefaced flouted social distancing recommendations. even said wear mask he's meeting ""presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens.""
""I know, somehow, see myself,"" President said back Thanks, agenda push, merely stating views based numbers know. no, arithmetic us wrong. cannot consider total cases, resolved. jury still unresolved ones. have, death percentage = 137631*100/(137631+1505671) = 8.3752%. saying /s We've sacrificed essential workers. pandemic/EcOnoMy requires bloooood. post history bro. mean person. r/Letsnotmeet It‚Äôs 7 day moving average clearly stated twice. Essentially 14 data points averaged two values. apparent looking graph topped today. look 7 day rolling data report cases evenly day whatever reason. asked question spike today. There‚Äôs story there. Probably dropped ball reporting infrastructure catching delay somewhere. Wtf, 3500 Maine since march I'm still anxious going work, Florida? order food mail stay months? hard figure out, still sound like struggling.

Did even watch YouTube clip posted above?

He made statement protect healthcare workers, ensure would PPE require.

Did forget March everyone went started hording N95 masks?

I'm curious defend President voted for, barely made public appearance wearing mask 4 months Global Crisis.

Fauci wearing mask since March #We need state ban 

Keep everyone state lot infected people. ulcerative colitis (like Crohn's disease), autoimmune, never going go away. Diet-wise, controlling similar Celiac.

I've heard reports hospitals exposing patients covid funding. Parents treat school daycare

This unpopular opinion agree completely. gotta wonder many parents shouting kid's education hired tutor. know going get much have, I‚Äôm going put there, large reason increase new cases past couple weeks they‚Äôve also increasing testing time picture number new cases, bottom picture tests done per day (Florida) It‚Äôs getting kind annoying we‚Äôre 7 months pandemic still ambiguous  aware virus gone away summer?

It largely disappeared countries distinct summer right now. Southern United States -- latitude Northern Africa -- desert sub-tropical climate without distinct winter season, states experiencing worst outbreaks.  narrative said, would mean pandemic fixed; thus, would amazing deal us.

If I‚Äôm understanding correctly, you‚Äôd rather see pandemic continue spread current course trajectory, Trump take credit flattening, even fixing, said pandemic? I‚Äôm misunderstanding you, feel free correct me. I‚Äôm understanding correctly, you‚Äôre bad people wearing masks political reasons‚Äîyou know, people (I presume) hate?‚Äîhoping liberal (which lean towards liberal, conservative) anointed savior pandemic...for political reasons?

For record, see you‚Äôre trying say, get it. wouldn‚Äôt rather says this, thinks this, gets even larger ego this, ultimately gets people (or kind people) change habits views betterment many, rather few, pandemic become ‚Äúfixed‚Äù? thought. might break country wide positive case record Sunday! next two weeks going get bad terms case loads Mexico even worse I've read mighty dollar important locals health, yay tourist season. 

I fucking hate living Florida..well usa whole tbh. 

And can't leave becaue fucking morons made Mexico Canada WANT build walls happily pay them.

Thank jackasses wont wear mask stay home.

And thank media morons reporting ""14 days 14 days that"" instead actually wear PROPER mask, dumbass bandana, thats airheads think needed safe/cured.

Reddit nutshell Eh, greed, probably closed parks, probably would opened theme parks opened month back, higher capacity too.

I'm saying Disney open, all, need shut yesterday. responsible employment 70,000+ Floridians, government forcing economy open, I'm guessing put lot pressure Disney reopen did. 

Again, closed least year, LEAST. ""blargh want MONEY! GRRR DIE MOUSE, PEASANTS!"" driving actions, especially since they're even making enough money make costs operating parks due lowered capacity.  saw studies here, couple months ago.  John Campbell mentioned them. paste link another comment. 

I know discussion whether ace inhibitors advised. people controlled blood pressure better. really, intelligence isnt really genetic agree you, understand came from. frustration causes many people country sit elections entirely. People feel like represented. matter wins get need. people also wanted punish democratic party did. agree it, understand folks felt frustrated enough act recklessly  spikes spill older population ... gonna see serious shit either one other. Even French people living French part Catalonia unlikely speak Catalan 100% sure speak Spanish either. Certainly 100% sure speak well enough compete Spaniards jobs.

To give one example. I'm lucky able wfh spouse unemployed. line work requires prolonged close contact clients high risk. industry open, feel safe sending back, are. feels like ones state quarantining well, alone. able wfh? Good fucking luck. white house zero credibility left pretty much anything. FFS, word NOVEL means know anything it. Public health advice changes rapidly facts still coming in. Fauci actual scientists consistently delivered best guidance available time.

On hand, white house taken many positions rooted nothing feelings greed. we're going cherry pick things Fauci got wrong back March, let us also point white house said:

* Seasonal flu worse covid
* One day magically go away
* Heat kills virus
* Hydroxychloriquine miracle cure
* use bleach *inside* body?
* People need get used mass casualties
* wearing mask patriot expression free speech
* flattened curve
* 99% cases totally harmless
* Slow testing please
* kidding, testing double edged sword So, probably super dumb question, ask anyways. like, let's say think might Covid contact someone know it, decide get tested, actually virus point. get sick going get tested too? Like, long line drug store hospital wherever tests? risk that? taking enough precautions that's unlikely? long consistent, extremely valuable. president, would hire trump advisor, opposite suggests. ü§£ ask. taped allen key together lighter use push buttons open pull handle doors (most businesses here). use lighter sanitize key.

In small closed environment like elevator think likely air transmission surface though.

 \- here's tool (not video). watch interviews DeVos, adamant opening schools. asked there's plan, says schools full smart people figure need open back up. amazing leadership wonderful plan /s. fact wear masks anyway alone doesn‚Äôt prove anything specific covid-19. 

They legit terrible ongoing health crisis called **air pollution** makes vulnerable variety diseases. 

They‚Äôve wearing masks years reasons. Florida takes note NY thousands senior citizens die. NY example do. I'm waiting day Dr. F becomes part Biden campaign. gonna spill hard older population. Damn. silly. There‚Äôs going psychotic withdrawing alcoholics flooding hospitals. answered question lmao. would even ask knew. Thanks support, appreciate it. seems like country going high score. Even though follow ""suggestions"" provided health officials, hopefully dont die. brewt news. immunity left 3 options=forced vaccinations, lockdown forever let people die. first case liklpely result civil war, second would likely mean virtual reality making comeback big way last would mean lots sad dying. like fucked whatever seems....this fun virologist‚Äôs wet dream. Normally experiments like could carried unethical nature.  willing participants teaching us contagious virus truly be. need stop virus first,like new york thats case wouldnt numbers higher,not lower? too. I've taken sleeping day I'm nightmares night. Waking up, heart pounding covered cold sweat. wake point dream I'm drowning. Bluntly, US way minimum 250k deaths, likely 500k. üò≠ doubt trump even seen Barron past months.. Man immigration rules really need toughened allow coronavirus become citizen like think that's true. Look United State's response 911, national crisis. Airports across country quickly, unilaterally, implement security upgrades, costing billions - done direction Federal Government. Nuclear Power plants - similar deal. Across board upgrades, plant worked spent 10 million dollars additional security measures - direction Federal Government. Consider Fukushima accident - nuclear plants unilaterally implement extensive safety upgrades, plant worked spent 50 million dollars new safety systems - done direction Federal Government. administration simply lost stomach lead. elected manfint. Delaware would like word don‚Äôt think agenda. due respect exactly point testing case? flu-like symptoms, assume isolate yourself. not, waiting 9 days find test results pointless. symptoms chances aren‚Äôt going isolate 9 days gives plenty time spread lots people.  Could middle ground between, regular organized classrooms 30+ students per class, home-schooled completely untrained mothers older siblings teachers ? 

Could find stay-at-home mother, block, bachelors degree could qualify teaching certificate, teach supervise kids immediate neighborhood? 

Could provide zoom-teachers, groups 20-ish kids, online? (And, tech- local- support parents get kids zoom-class?)

Are realistic, plausible, ways educate supervise kids, without putting parents, teachers, adults danger?

""If look masks buy drug store, leakage around really much protect you,"" said. ""People start saying, 'Should start wearing mask?' Now, United States, is¬†absolutely reason whatsoever wear mask."" - Dr. Anthony Fauci (2/17/20) - ""Short that,¬†Fauci says skip masks unless contagious...""

""During early weeks pandemic, public-health experts 'were concerned public health community, many people saying this, concerned time personal protective equipment, including N95 masks surgical masks, short supply,' Fauci interview with¬†*TheStreet.* means problem everyone, everywhere quarantine travel restrictions. kids, would Darwin Award highly specialized knowledgeable genetic engineering experts, weighed actually studying covid19's genetic makeup closely, say zero evidence genetic engineering covid-19's DNA RNA. possible wrong? seen evidence genetic engineering covering up?

Sure, that's possible. Occam's Razor says otherwise. Put another way; walks like duck, swims like duck, quacks like duck, likely duck. point need trust majority scientists basically honest reasonably competent. least, that's intend interpret things. otherwise, nothing actually real, facts unreliable, everything possibly fake massive failure science nefarious plot.

Logic, rational thinking, observing things unfold 50 adult years, says no. observant intelligent person, basic researching skills willingness dig couple layers beyond news headlines, generally assume facts conclusions come reality based. elevator bride I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre living younger side spectrum. Take look many people age group passed covid (realizing includes ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù people) rest easy. know NYC, one maybe 4 places exposed virus anywhere realm statistically feasible? Find another way. rocket science even difficult

I‚Äôve quit alcohol, meth heroin attest much harder eat calorie deficit months quit drugs. really difficult. think idea would banning non essential travel allowing essential travel (different essential workers- basically anyone traveling work) trade continue. Idk enforce that, maybe permits essential travel enforced toll booths/speedpass something. aside comment: girlfriend PA- she‚Äôs worked covid floors ER since March/April hasn‚Äôt seen elderly relatives abundance caution. worked Sunday night couple weeks ago asked staff drive thru testing cite Thursday. Knowing she‚Äôd essentially hazmat suit day working Friday, thought timing perfect get tested finally see grandparents weekend. test done cite staffed got phone call night saying shift canceled couldn‚Äôt work test came back.

I don‚Äôt know found out, getting tested got flagged she‚Äôd working covid floors months, wouldn‚Äôt let work test pending. It‚Äôs weird think employers make go produce positive test. Florida cases entire US. Think it. Really think it. got tiny baby problems Plus **contact politicians**, too. Wuhan forcibly quarantined people unlike nyc partly explains less deaths. NY state alone cannot force quarantine people without raising constitutional concerns. brings another issue take consideration whether value individual human rights not. Also take consideration citizens china better attitude facing epidemic unlike people america government's duty. people america care.

Regardless many cases currently NY, decreasing cases still improvement something proud about.

Of course everyone hopes 0 cases that's impossible new york state independent country there's poor leadership federal government.

I see else complain point state could've done better. States much need federal government step in. federal government's fault nyc well, might well say states america could've done better. comparison new york countries would pointless said compare standards apples oranges. Science believe believe. accept someone else using scientific method peer review prove disprove theory. irresponsible recommend cutting gluten diet testing Full Celiac panel Well normally enough information know whrn risk (a friend went sweden f.e. tested isolte then) contact tracing works quite good maybe healthcare personal tested regulary need quarantine normal people risk contact beeing tested stay home cleared you‚Äôre saying Kardashians get finally start making progress US? Clearly wasn‚Äôt issue weeks ago previous ban alcohol sales. Even though potential problem fact emergency ICU admissions didn‚Äôt increase non-COVID cases.

Theyre assuming wrong they're assuming lmao 

I fully agree you. Alcohol South Africa lead cases alcohol poisoning odd punch brutal attacks, stabbings shootings. I'm surprised theyve banned alcohol again. think start reporting American numbers actually start declining, point huge increases always going new records doesn‚Äôt seem surprising anyone people fucking love Disney. NEW WORLD RECORD!!!! hit 20k? work LabCorp. getting specimens (New Jersey) states like Florida, Texas, Arizona help since labs areas can‚Äôt handle load curve gone down. preparing tests saw week ago. sad see knowing theres much Got results 2 days. say you‚Äôve around someone COVID. co-corker got results back 3 hours saying that. appreciate it.

Strong symptoms often times actually caused virus/bacteria rather immune system fighting it, stronger symptoms, stronger immune systems response stronger response antibody producing cells made, they'll stay alive longer. 

But good confirmed. nine days minus 14 days infected sometime middle June. iconic, legendary, wig snatching, etc.

My job parent keep healthy safe. many people need die DeSantis realizes absolutely incompetent? *Florida creepily rubbing hands together salivating* That's cares about.

That probably people understand economics. see stocks up, automatically assume economy good. ""In total, services reported 16,637 positive tests. 381 hospitalized, 7,011 recovered three died""

Aka long ways off... Really, knew ""Wuhan tool"". Great idea people need know. NM state senator, ""I believe science behind masks. work.""

So doctors world wear they're stupid? People going hazardous situations put hazmat suits stupid?

I think maybe stupid.. pandemic movies start government's refusing listen science. sad millions die need to. colossal government fuck would've remedied rent freeze (like countries) simple piece legislation tacked missed mortgage payments back end mortgage, thing would've happened rent. mortgages freeze, rent. Instead government went greedy route, cared economy keeping people safe killed 140,000 people it. economists working crooks. what's solution?  acts fast gets reopen protests I‚Äôm pro-mask. Never implied said otherwise. tf would presume otherwise? 

And STUDY **NOT** SARS2. isn‚Äôt even social mitigation, ffs. It‚Äôs wearing masks symptomatic flu HOME. 

It also says: **We concluded household use masks associated low adherence ineffective controlling seasonal ILI.**

And studies SARS1 show *that* coronavirus wasn‚Äôt spread asymptomatically presymtomatically. Unlike SARS2, largely is. 

Thanks proving point clearly. I‚Äôm saving link. :)

Please stay well mate. would say support Hazard pay frontline workers (some received couple weeks, around $2 per hour increase, though lot something). 

Support major changes government like Universal Healthcare (which unfortunately neither candidate stand right now). horrible think essential workers cannot afford healthcare bad healthcare ($10,000 deductibles, etc). get sick covid screwed.

If curbside pickup option, use it. Wear masks correctly go in. Tip people able. expect worker confront wear masks (it puts harms way, safest way ignore maskless much possible).

Basically care too. lockdown/wear masks/social distance get virus control less risk everyone. nearly doubled record total tests processed though.

New York trending positively Florida set US record daily Covid-19 positive test results. Sure, New York got completely hammered Covid spring they've got act together locked things down. Florida hand open business confirmed cases continuing spiral control. RemindMe! 64 days take bet.

Violent Crime Japan low, groping harassment big issues there. think would make sense open discussion vaccination results least one Disney blogger saying site sick were, going go get tested till trip - opening day reservations. went, complained fully enjoy sick were... 


There two employees tested right starting work, get positive results back worked 2 days. Fat asian guy here. I‚Äôm guys. Scary fuck, russian roulette, taksies backies.. Translation: stays lane...while folks White House experts try take Fauci's lane. shows actually benefits form economic ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù US. fucking know. first time life I've written elected representatives. allright, there's many ways cope disasters. Like Russia, call mass graves, fraternal graves, detract reality looking tens thousands nameless corpses concrete slab. I'm sure USA figure something out.  think can‚Äôt admit wrong. he‚Äôs quadrupled original shitty response it.  Voting (or, importantly, ballot access) America become polarizing issue along partisan political lines.

It really hard describe foreigner, one half political apparatus want many people vote possible. largely actual platform caucus (essentially, ""The Handmaid's Tale, racist, also boss' boss' boss gets big raise"") politically untenable wildly unpopular. cannot change platform appeal wider spectrum voters two halves party (the 1% class White Cultural/Racial Grievance Cohort) would either primary replace someone bizarre abandon party entirely.

Thus, party made disenfranchising voters preventing participation--particularly among groups unlikely vote party--a major goal past...forty years so.

And that's even going fact right vote *extremely* hard-won difficult practice certain groups (such African-Americans) since...forever. TIL scientists aren‚Äôt human. Don‚Äôt know friend is, took 4 days get test results Fort Lauderdale. Got tested free city  Please stay safe. IIRC Disney opened day. See yall 2 weeks üëã tennis.jpg 13 million now, another 64 days later! wow Movie theaters break even filling 25% theatre. There‚Äôs reason can‚Äôt reopen reduced capacity distancing. Looking likely...  Hmmm. got pink eye first time forever last week, fevers tiredness.

I got test yesterday, let's see goes. (Chuckles) ""im danger"" environments would something like typically used in; operating rooms? Viruses don‚Äôt evolve either suppose? largely disappeared countries distinct summer right now. Southern United States -- latitude Northern Africa -- desert sub-tropical climate without distinct winter season, states experiencing worst outbreaks.

This biggest leap logic I've ever seen someone make. southern US ""desert"" climate without distinct winter season. Step 1: Buy 3 week trip Disney world.

Step 2: leave Disney entire time.

Step 3: Get covid (Because good luck getting it)

Step 4: Sue profit! problably time life feel bad people too. Yikes! Someone needs shut US start again! That's proper bull! shit Creating vaccine one thing. Distribution FDA approval major hold ups. 
If state‚Äôs covid19 positivity rate almost 20%, numbers testing more, also means people getting sick staggering pace, thus interventions needed.


Not sure Florida‚Äôs governor idiot, asshole, leaning toward both. possible would working one right now? makes zero sense. always see girls without masks ?

I feel like females dont get shit think lives come anyone else‚Äôs safety. sad would silly...be curious Virginia one states counting ""Unique people tested."" NY not. 

*The number unique people tested look overall number individuals tested SARS-CoV-2 Virginia. method looking testing measures count person regardless many times tested weeks months. VDH used method originally way measure number opportunities identify new anything close resembling control many big states. less ideal situation online success failure, undeniably criminally reckless situation disaster kill people...and end back online month two anyway. options right now.

making concessions china non-starter. lot money already spent ""yellow scare"" propaganda. concessions made china everybody's opinion china starts thawing, propaganda money go drain.

I bet amount money spent ""yellow scare"" propaganda easily billions dollars. inheritors think 150,000 americans lives worth billion dollars.

so assuming 1 billion dollars spent ""yellow scare"" propaganda 150,000 us citizens died covid-19. death worth 6,666.66. ironic numbers would come so.

there's also money spent facial recognition systems US. obsolete people wearing masks. think Fauci really even said anything special considered common sense reached conclusions regular person reach own. people know masks social distancing, care think ones icu. damn marxists don‚Äôt know wear mask.

Even supposing going back school fall leads 1,000 total deaths children young adults year, we're talking 1 100,000 risk--less 1/30 population-wide risk dying car accident. In-person education obviously worth risk. Man wouldn‚Äôt recognize free thinker makes decisions research stared face. China, according CCP's published criteria diagnosing SARS-2, positive test alone enough. must accompanied specific symptoms well.

This means public numbers ""confirmed"" cases exclude asymptomatic, also mildly symptomatic. country report way, obviously expect massive discrepancy numbers.

Here recent 7th version diagnostic criteria translated Chinese Cardiology Society: [Chinese Clinical Guidance COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis Treatment (7th edition)](http://kjfy.meetingchina.org/msite/news/show/cn/3337.html)

=== excerpt ===

*5. Diagnostic criteria*

*a) Suspected cases*

*Comprehensive analysis following epidemiological history clinical manifestations:*

*i. Epidemiological history*

1. *Travel residence history Wuhan surrounding areas, communities documented COVID-19 positive cases within 14 days onset illness.*
2. *History contact COVID-19-infected persons (positive nucleic acid detection) within 14 days onset illness.*
3. *History contact patients presenting fever respiratory symptoms, travel reside Wuhan surrounding areas, communities documented COVID-19 positive cases within 14 days onset illness.*
4. *Clustering onset (2 cases fever and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks small areas home, office, school class, etc.)*

*ii. Clinical manifestation*

1. *Presenting fever and/or respiratory symptoms.*
2. *With imaging features mentioned COVID-19 pneumonia.*
3. *In early stage disease, total number leukocytes normal decreased, lymphocyte count normal decreased.*

***A case meets one epidemiological history criteria two clinical manifestations identified suspected case. clear epidemiological history, 3 clinical manifestations required.***

*b) Confirmed cases*

***Suspected cases one following*** *etiology serological evidence identified confirmed cases:*

  (1) Real-time RT-PCR detection positive COVID-19 nucleic acid.
  (2) viral gene identified gene sequencing highly homologous known COVID -19 ;
  (3) COVID-19-specific IgM IgG antibodies tested positive. titer COVID-19-specific IgG antibody 4 times higher recovery period acute phase.* 

=== end excerpt ===

These criteria intentionally complicated, re-iterate implications scenarios:

A person shows doctor sore throat, fever, tests positive SARS-2, link infection ""cluster"" nothing shows lung imaging. Fever positive test, means ""confirmed case"" right? No, according criteria. confirmed criteria suspected must met, according suspected criteria, contact known infected, THREE clinical manifestations must present, including lung imaging signs.

A person exposed outbreak infected person, signs pneumonia lungs bad cough, tests positive using one one three listed testing mechanisms. clearly SARS-2 case added official count right? China. Again, despite positive test, person meet criteria ""suspected"", even known contact infected person outbreak area, TWO clinical manifestation must present.

People constantly questioning China's numbers. complicated, exactly published guidelines say are, counts tiniest fractions positive tests ""confirmed"". exclude asymptomatic, symptomatic symptoms listed one three ""clinical manifestations"", symptomatic one ""clinical manifestations"", many symptomatic multiple ""clinical manifestations"" known exposure. know virus, excludes almost infected people, hence nothing report.

They plain sight avoid accusations cover-up. ""We hide anything, misunderstood methodology"". killing old. Look stats. causing huge long term issues people ages including children! saying shut down, counties could least pretend support mask order. Makes face look tiny hands I'm lazy look numbers again, posts sub lot [Lt. Gov best analogy whole situation. haven‚Äôt able put finger good one perfect.

Cause we're best everything. Obviously even people enough catch fine them, they‚Äôll ignore it, fight court, etc.

When non-compliance becomes norm, you‚Äôre options.

Ultimately violation punishes disease spread, unfortunately gets innocent people too. CMIIW = correct I'm wrong.

I guess I'm digressing point little bit. I'm getting kids vectors spreading even pose little risk Covid19. Kids school make super-spreader event occur daily, multiple times day. Without requiring kids wear masks basically asking trouble.

Kids two go school. remain home. 

Right every kids go school Asian countries, example, Japan, South Korea, China, requires mask school. Isnt California Democrat one hardest hit? Every place definitely south lot places line Target today folks signing petition recall Newsom one mask. literally watched masked persons pass booth, non-masked persons stop sign recall.

Sad times we're living in. amazing. might hope yet.

Probably not, man dream. probably told wearing one dims election prospects. Wonder many less people would died done along. It‚Äôll take amendment. shutdown for? shocked there‚Äôs increase cases?

American billionaire Bill Gates said Saturday ""optimistic"" battle COVID-19 called medicines vaccines distributed need rather ""highest bidders"".

Gates' foundation pledged $7.4 billion global vaccines alliance Gavi June help immunisation programmes disrupted coronavirus.

""If let drugs vaccines go highest bidders, instead people place needed, longer unjust, deadlier pandemic,"" said Microsoft founder Saturday's video message virtual international conference COVID-19 AIDS.

""We need leaders make hard decisions distributing based equity, market driven factors.""

Gates stressed pandemic interrupted supply chains drugs, including AIDS, risks disruptions ""could prevent hundreds thousands people getting treatments need -- sub-Saharan Africa.""

""But remain optimistic,"" added. ""We defeat COVID-19 continue make strides AIDS health crisis.""

He said researchers making great advances.

""Better diagnostic tools developed identify infected. Investments made libraries anti-viral drugs under-invested branch science.

""Also, making great progress vaccines,"" said.

""These platforms useful particular virus. also help us specifically HIV.

""Of course, big difference getting platform making sure get products everyone needs them.""

The second reason optimism, added, global solidarity, already demonstrated fight AIDS, Global Fund created 2002, American aid programme PEPFAR, launched George W Bush intended mainly sub-Saharan Africa.

""Whether AIDS COVID-19, global cooperation resolve invent tools get needed critical,"" said. why? long wear masks fine. even need social distance. protestors taught us scientific fact. personal Vietnam. Doubtful. many people damn selfish anti-science Western, industrialized nations (but especially certain ones Canada Mexico). Even everyone who's sensible logical masks best avoid thing, anti-mask, anti-science geniuses continuing spread it, COVID willing happily accept. Immunity forever (if we're lucky, we'll get year natural antibodies - unlucky, get months, less) unless thing behaves unlike coronavirus we've encountered, like type virus (ex: chickenpox, ignoring discussions shingles complications) immune life. 

So always - forgive me, I'm spitballing numbers head - say, 20% population care. 20% may herd immunity given point assuming worst case scenario months best immunity infection recovery. 60% people vulnerable given point, time passes, 20% people *were* immune lose immunity antibodies fade system. effect, virus continue ricochet back forth vaccine found.

This COVID-19 could - and, rate places like America going, likely - become endemic. always pockets people Google U degrees asymptomatic carriers. vaccine found enough people take (either choice force), we're living Miss Rona. shitty roommate. say really matters. affect small number prisoners country pretty severe increase long time. 
I know enough say pushed changes tend moving upwards quite awhile quite speed. 

Ok. I'm done much know wanna get debate requires research I'm already bed. Calls puts Monday? Indians beefing Chinese right boycotting Chinese made apps, might want find better source rely on. It‚Äôs officially 1% Americans.

But course, varies great deal region/city/town/hamlet. first poopie himself! big boy is! Unironically would make life us NE much better many ways. 

Will never happen civil war breaks pretty much happen again, police state US would never let get that. We'd go full china/russia authoritarian civil war day age. Someone help him! He's literally dying eyes.. know February, I've self-isolating since February. Reports seriousness covid available early December moving goalpost, regardless. argument made NY officials enough downplayed severity issue. February, governor told everyone worry flu. March, 1000 people dead 30,000+ active cases. pretty obvious government took seriously February could've significantly mitigated March numbers. live across river wife date night today St Matthews. Blew mind many people following mask mandate. Either mask chin around wrist. 
I really wish business‚Äô would stand refuse service following mandate. 
Sadly, fear bad publicity wanting deal altercations. 

If going commit... need commit. Stop tiptoe‚Äôing around everything. people continue spead human ashes there? watched video strange practice. denying guys it, flu, bad cold, anything effects nose cause loss taste smell...
I'm sure Covid trick differently others though. surprise? Trump aides tested every day, people comes contact tested beforehand. never normally needs wear mask, hospital high probability infected people nearby, to.

He‚Äôs stupid, it‚Äôs calculated. know least seven Dallas had/has it. One tested positive June 26 invited us drinks last night (July 10). Yolon't Round Rock = GOP stronghold. North Austin politically way ‚Äúout Austin‚Äù  thinking today would okay Trump selling branded masks meant people would wear them. could pay enough OC right now. close getting Canada's total PER DAY, ridiculous, that's reported case God hate news updates linking old news. I'll delete this, says April 11 instead June 11. pandemic either greatest thing happened teachers worst thing happen students. He's fucking idiot. Trump engaging reality cause concern. tie 38th ban travel China Fines? Typically hit someone wallet listen. Someone forgot turn switch back Science ‚Äúdrinking Kool Aid‚Äù world? gonna breath? Whoever convinced trying assassinate carbon dioxide poisoning. /s idiot, Shark's real!

/s know people recently got results back withing 3 days. Unfortunately, recently saw MAGA mask testing capacity hospital capacity handle happening SoCal happening here. There‚Äôs reason Bay Area hospitals accepting patients it‚Äôs can‚Äôt straight turn people away good options; it‚Äôs literally part oath harm. can‚Äôt ‚Äúsave‚Äù beds locals likely need them, watch numbers swell. aren‚Äôt empty; 673 ventilators available county 1.9 million (not mention San Mateo county residents seek care Stanford) you‚Äôre arguing fine post article saying we‚Äôre particularly well reopening.

None evidence points towards increased contact humans good option. Wat? wouldnt tainted damn near eradicated outside single digit quarantines. area highest risk group...... kinda like realized dumbass idea We‚Äôre dealing what-ifs guessing I‚Äôd point he‚Äôs coward‚Äôs coward thought decent chance harm befalling he‚Äôd beg medical team everything possibly could. also see toddler point refusing supervision too. man many shitty, irredeemable qualities it‚Äôs hard tell ones might win given situation. look happy wearing it. He's gonna school everybody low post Floribama forever Listen fuckers, every single one wearing mask me! Got it?! Lol looks pissed off. Little late embassy said ""unknown pneumonia."" Probably warn citizens without contradicting official government statements. Plz show us 7 studies. prove us wrong right now. dashing Club Fed probably bad, get reaction Wagner every time he's brought up. Canadian provinces, too. Ontario, geographically larger Texas, culturally heterogenous (there's large incredibly diverse immigrant population plus wide urban/rural divide), population 15 million, currently seeing 150 positive cases per day aboit 30,000 tests per day. We're quite relieved, we're (mostly) wearing masks, feel mystified pity way US behaving. course, key prioritize human life money, concept many Americans seem reject outright. 7 sources REALLY hard... many years go on? getting information? keep posting claims over. That's bad idea actually It‚Äôs much killer beds meds.

We run New York happens.

Pick 1 5 loved ones want murder see you‚Äôre still smug cockroach it. rate, coupled winter spread flu complexities, there‚Äôs going much economy end year. Lockdowns happening many cities/states (I‚Äôm guessing, based still wide open ongoing growth spread.) Look. Trump's cosplaying rational empathetic American. UV/HEPA filters thing though. saying he‚Äôs coolest president they‚Äôve ever seen. Answer: there‚Äôs vaccine mass majority had. catching Covid trauma occur kid. Watching parent, family member, teacher, friend‚Äôs parent family member die INCREDIBLY traumatic, mention friend getting it. think end all, isn‚Äôt missed year person school, good chance lifelong emotional trauma occurring well. I‚Äôm teacher, nothing would make happier going back full time seeing kids them, don‚Äôt want put trauma losing family members, friends, teachers, accomplish much home could socially distanced/no sharing classroom materials/minimal movement/etc environment subjected regardless someone else contracting virus. üçåüëåüôèüçÜüåß doctor confirmed it. two patients exact symptoms. says waited long test. Also, parents symptoms mom's friend coffee park mask came it.  So. Annoying. Good luck buddy 30 million people without job. Trump always winning I‚Äôm someone you‚Äôd call ‚Äúone theorists‚Äù I‚Äôve wearing mask since March. 

Whether virus engineering pandemic natural one doesn‚Äôt matter. Whether spread ‚Äúreal‚Äù nefarious effort doesn‚Äôt matter. 

The virus kills people, masks make everything much unlikely. Literally loss wearing mask. 

If HCQ works prophylactic suspected, Trump def taking it. one wonder he‚Äôs chosen wear mask? disagree, uncanny often line ""good enough"" falls precisely ""stuff want do"" ""stuff want people do."" purpose. want us die. That's logical explanation left point. happy he's prison. negligence killed 130,000 people. far. whole argument stats, they're people. single death unacceptable yet we're shaking heads saying there's nothing could've done prevent 32 THOUSAND people dying? NOTHING?? Sorry, sit right me, especially since knew tiny fraction people.

I agree you, given role transit hub foreign/domestic travel limited information surrounding covid/how treat time NY would hit hard. I'm saying completely preventable, understand praise 32,000 dead NYers. Yes, we're better rest country... that's high bar. Genuinely, support recalling Newsom (I thought many people died watch) shame mask complacency rate, though. sad don‚Äôt live there. 2 years express entry got call situation improved US (until obviously). I've already seen Trump 2020 mask grocery store. Whatever takes people wear guess.  lol knew incompetency possible amongst ‚Äòleaders‚Äô. would surprised took seriously secret. Trump pushing narrative get country open up. failed going double down? I‚Äôve lumped years though anti depressants stuff help recently asked always fell tired want lay need lay down. longer prolong screams back me. suggested CFS said can‚Äôt test it? act like know talking about, spend time posting *Reddit*. I'm conflicted... think autistic generally went medicine. Apparently I'm wrong. Sorry. finally grew single grey cell shallow brain. Double yikes.  Florida Texas 50k tests per day - understandable 

Arizona 18k tests per day - understandable takes weeks, especially crisis time

I went got tested live testing 30k range per day; result two days...so matter many analogies metaphors want make, unacceptable taking 10 days month get folks results.

This something it, 10 days month many others spreading await result? Since highest number covid cases right now, America lead example, ban Americans leaving country. could see Devos putting rule pushed Texas Board prohibits Trumps US textbooks, crazy shit  leaders insist opening schools requiring person attendance right.../s Wait, scientists study determine dumber are, likely dumb stuff? Please tell weren‚Äôt best scientists. Like, guys got online degrees Caribbean university still barely passed right? indoor dining bars NYC. think Biden pedo rapist, don‚Äôt think Trump, bias incredible opinion loses weight might had. like it. What's pedigree though? cheap China thing? it‚Äôs 99% harmless then!

/s Karen, Freedumb, MahGuns Diabeetus, Four Horsemen American Apocalypse Yeah theyre going stay Florida. We're mutually fucked. matter time.  . use tinfoil hat Facebook nice getting notifications. ... coughs death live television ultimate fuck libtards. personally feel much owned. Thanks Americans, rest world get good data virus spreads, work. Says dude can't stop hitting happen? :) They've saying months masks useful hospital. That's base taking away this.

Nothing change. think post worthy want share someone, I've watching active cases NY state past days (since live here) watching drop active cases California rise. finally crossed NY officially less active cases California, NY 227,391 California 227,402. NY's active cases continue decrease further.

This despite California hailed state look relation stop covid shut first, looks like besides never really anything else help stop it. NY sure definitely close fast enough, *did* close down, seemed put good plan action reopening multiple phases reopening new daily cases still decreasing.
 
I chalk us reopening phases based factual data ""well feels right open now"". Sticking factual data instead feelings saved many people (though could saved closed faster, sadly). economy slowly getting back full swing stuff slowly opens yet daily cases still staying low. Helping people economy long run. fucking time. tested negative know it?  former Disney cast member can‚Äôt even imagine enforcing new rules they‚Äôll enforce people treat them. It‚Äôs hard enough working is. Tourists realllll shitty people. american dream join one kind 1% There‚Äôs problem Marty, says, ‚ÄúMade Japan...‚Äù know anything Midlands? Republi-can? They're two totally different things.

Also business risk. play safe, going get super-rich. need take calculated risks. sometimes take risk lose. I've pleasure speaking several extremely wealthy (multiple hundreds millions networth), get rich want safe returns. want big wins. suffer bunch losses along way...that's goes.

That's nature business. Particularly running dozens hundreds ventures.

I know specifics businesses managed--and well may failed due mismanagement--but people saying ""Wow, Trump 3 bankruptcies. must bad businessman, lol!"" know business works.

I'm saying he's good bad businessman (I know enough say either way), think rich people bat thousand... exactly place would expect find info like this. ""Preprint"" ""hot press"". Sometimes pass peer review, looks solid. flu, duh... used love channel. right mind would travel pandemic? travel: visit bunch crowded places (including freaking parade!)  visit old lady living middle nowhere, without wearing mask naturally. Lost respect man that. Oregon population 4 million. keep things perspective. gross I'm torn giving vote correct downvote truth Yep. would even go far speculate could even mean already vaccine available veins T-cell positive individuals. ""officially"", tested confirmed, def lot unconfirmed asymptotic cases walking around. 

They really working herd immunity. think disease actually weakening macho strain nationalism espoused Trump, Bolsonaro, Modi, Putin, Xi, etc. Merkel said, ""lies make go away"". Probably higher comes immunity... work unfortunately, T-cells blood plasma. blood plasma therapies disease modifying agent soluble form. Next week, Trump claim ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù wearing masks stop spread COVID19, everybody it, Fauci Obama tried stop him, brilliant idea along.

And know, gets legion idiots mask up, I‚Äôm fine that. Remember Lucifer said ""Better reign Hell serve Heaven""?

At least stupid American smart enough live rest world.

Although I've heard NZ actually pretty nice. people kinda pricks, feel *too* bad over-run China US fuck-all save (because nice us lately). üò± That's great! think that's normal experience people, though, especially little kids them. know definitely cousin went, she'd multiple times day planned completely. Everyone different endurance levels speed. we? New Zealand pretty well. Large areas Australia well. US victim governments. get vote  far tell evidence hospitals reporting local, state, presidential pressure underreport. said would destroy republican party didn‚Äôt say Don‚Äôt forget constant rain storms drive people together indoors... Gotta deflect Roger Stone hate. CANT BREATHE MOUTH HOLE YOURE FUCKING FREEDUMB EAR guaranteed way become infected, let‚Äôs cut bullshit pandering. Maybe, certainly explanations.   * humans Oh fuck that. I'm getting CBRN gas mask Also multi-decade decline general health can't helping.

According CDC 1 3 Americans diabetic pre-diabetic.

66 percent Adults one prescription meds, one.

Close half people obese.

It's hard predict exactly ways precipitous decline health population might impact nation, dire state essentially everyone descending chronic disease. continues destroy nation. arithmetic lifetime cost treating diabetes alone enough exhaust entire national GDP.

I care problem hand, first thing, nation individual, take care health. Don‚Äôt forget people dying aren‚Äôt enough ICU beds. people develop lifelong damage respiratory system die earlier life. 

If really think it‚Äôs big deal, must think 9/11 practically nothing. really sad state affairs Americans go mourning 3,000 lives lost disregarding 130,000 lives lost. Donald Trump tricked thinking pandemic political. Wow. 


I one continue everything power protect fellow citizens disease killing healthy people 30s. actually care country fellow Americans I‚Äôm intelligent enough realize 0.01% way many people lose virus prevented. wearing mask social distancing staying bars/restaurants could save even one life, I‚Äôm going it. sociopaths idiots refusing comply life saving measures. That‚Äôs US one hardest hit countries. 


Trump literally made US laughing stock world less four years, people don‚Äôt see limited(and literally dying) base. knowledge? already running fumes bro. think misread comment kids going school, going school dressed improperly, without mask. mask comment separate school comment. Atleast that‚Äôs got shit hits fan, virus comes straight you. Brazil's President positive test must something change heart. Poll numbers hurt either. like somebody suggested could typical Trump bait switch technique he's perfected book he's ever read. major news item so-called ""president"" something resembling normal human behavior. Biden? Excuse me, good fascist r/Conservative made clear testing. Europe seems particularly bizarre. European Union got flack ascertaining COVID, reality matters health individual partners. Therefore crisis hit differently different countries, literally first thing aggressive states close borders worse hit area.

Now, borders actually supposed always open, ""special circumstances"" supercedes this. Closing borders probably change much, popular move. also antibody testing red cross still, people double donating blood getting antibody test.

There's actually really big blood shortage general going on, anyone donate blood, even covid, needed. Uh...What say racist? Wow. Ok. even say fucking p4r7y name, anything ""s1d3z"" ""p4r7y"". You-know-who made issue p0l1tizzz discussing U5 situation impossible here, that's mod teams goal. Unwavering support you-know-who policies matter what. reason americans still believe hoax think death count matters. virus way dangerous plague sense negative effects show long term, financially health wise. Right usa like frog slow heating pot water saying everything alright feel harmed yet! Like donkey giving carrots get harness. Thanks sharing! sounds rough, unfortunately, that's get passed this! Nitric Oxide. Sorry!

It's neurotransmitter, among things. No, take classes focused modern history international relations.

Please provide source, anecdote. think data collected? one guy gathering numbers, everyone gets him, something? lot trump 2020 maga masks there. idea it‚Äôs team not. basically I've saying now, everyone fussing death rate covid fail realize lots people survive end much worse lives started without covid, even 0 deaths, fact robs people former lives abilities, enough try stop pandemic spreading... nope, people gonna keep going ""well death rate high majority effects older people care!"" Despicable... said hoax. Fuckass realizes finally starts normalization mask usage comes standard base praise re-election his. Well counties refusing enforce order, needs order issue stay home order without publicly admitting wrong along especially overrode Harris County‚Äôs mask order back April. click link third reply down. 
Mike Davis, also posted this-  
"" ‚ÄúThe chance catching Covid-19 passing interaction public space therefore minimal. many cases, desire widespread masking reflexive reaction anxiety pandemic."" "".  sell maga masks win sides makes money followers wear damn mask also didn‚Äôt blow whistle anything, since stationed HK ‚Äúsecond-hand information‚Äù. Edit: workplace said wasn‚Äôt even research subject ‚Äúblew whistle‚Äù enough grant special visa though? husband coworker whose mother died Covid-19. coworker insists mother died pneumonia, knows *for fact* hospitals told mark deaths Covid related, get funding way.

So probably correct - people change minds. (at least according one example) possible even death loved one even sway them. herd immunity doesnt work would vaccine. restaurant Florida live stream webcam. watched today curious would be. witnessed older couple, sit silence, eat food, conversation... One phone... pay leave.. one wearing masks.. really worth it? that??? almost warrant party stress relief entertainment socializing bum restaurant sit whole time... C'mon man

As disclaimer: people likely spreader actively conversation loud risking exposure first place. get infected become potential spreaders days outing. worth it. Exactly, let‚Äôs go ‚Äúfucked over‚Äù least amount kids dying traumatized go physically go school Nope, they‚Äôll blame Chinese equivalent shouting fire crowded theater. legal consequences spreading sort deadly misinformation. thing worst thing echo chamber make us little uncomfortable wearing mask. echo chamber could potentially kill you.

Moral: Wear damn mask, isn‚Äôt joke.

Edit: article. fair according personally got rich it. wish could somehow shit outdoors. would KILL outdoor gym right could stay open. Probably absolutely miserable heat better nothing. I'm UK we're currently rising wave. 3rd hardest referring total number deaths.

Number cases deaths fallen consistently since peak April R value still hovering 1 regional outbreaks city Leicester reopening steps reversed due that.

We wait see affect continued reopening 4th July next weeks R value monitored prevent cases rising. think steps need reversed future. 

To point though talks mask wearing made mandatory indoors hope happens. Sounds like horrible experience, pleasantly surprised brother survived too. No, pay appropriately. Jesus gonna martyr every profession Get ready see 200,000-300,000 dead next summer.

With way exponential growth works, could happen within next 3-4 months - take 12 months. people refuse social distance / wear masks - curve likely spike quickly.

Still probably end overall IFR 0.5-1.0%, spike push towards upper end range instead lower end due running medical resources. Fox News Trumps impotence surprising, masks effective think lives would save even single tweet!

I wish could tell in-laws ‚Äúdude, put mask on. Even Trump it!‚Äù Yeah start rotting fruit, one looks dirty next rotting fruit. 

All people focusing ""he lied"" may well right wing agenda different economists. 

Tearing much fucked trying salvage can, still seem plenty USA citizens absolutely common sense. literally stupid understand people move one part country other, think makes smart. get us divided America number 1 Cause one would give away 7.4 billion.... part [Bill Gates ""evil stopped trying understand conspiracy theorist long time ago yet vets still vote him. voted last 2 sitting Republicans draft dodgers. fjck    I've never pink eye, late February got sick weeks really bad, husband youngest kid. teen asked reddish eyeshadow on. didn't, read story nurse treating covid patients, noticed red eyelids patients. took anibody test May, came back negative husband. make personal freedom thing pretend like people get harassed conservative areas wearing mask Yes eventually canyon filled bodies longer fatal jump proven wrong pwned libs! mom allergy like symptoms. urged wear mask home go get tested. think anything, became bit argument us. fever came gone twice last 9 days. said feeling better today.

They're bit stupid lol, despite least trying unlike people. I've kept distance completely, enough issues compliance rules ive tried implementing. daughter congestion first days quarantine, gotten worse. seems mostly good now. sees camera gets pissed lol. legit wanna seen wearing mask. People that.  Feed ego.  Save lives.

If people talk bad mask he'll never again. there? another stroke? !RemindME 3 months ""Well, it?"" Trust - entire chapters him. fail pandemic. sell country. emulate hitler. apply bronzer. Worked great wet iPhone. Let's get fixed already could ask gays swap rainbows correct different. However, think issue view defaults. virus, think defaults whatever true SARS, MERS, influenza presumed true Covid-19, demonstrated otherwise.    

There little much ""the virus innocent proven guilty"" type thinking. 148 deaths yesterday highest daily death total Europe, far nation.

Also, 148 deaths tell whole story. Northern Ireland Scotland 0 deaths again, Wales 1 England 147.

You'd expect England far larger total due size; levels seeing last fortnight. revisionist all. NY certainly made share mistakes beginning. think anyone denies that. even debate closing schools, hindsight obvious thing do. links posted decisions made data available time. agree decisions time risk averse interpreted available data differently, back January February, still medical professionals say worse flu. 

The point chose respond data started coming in. clear virus contained, automatically assumed exponential growth model (I remember tracking numbers daily fit predictions +/-2). scaled ICU capacity, imposed quarantine provided daily updates current status plan action. organized, based data made sense.

The high death count result NY learning mistakes. lesson states well. Star Trek reference? find silicon based life something? always ""Get money!"", making optimistic possible assumptions, letting someone else's problem work out. Except time ran something big that. Figured would Vista Windows 8  opening back again, guess we'll see. asshole Say goodbye sports programs upcoming generation‚Äôs lowered lung capacity. 70 times reach herd immunity! Yeah. IFR likely range .5-1%. Plus official death rate undercounts. could 10%. 

I feel like mandating masks nationally February closing nightclubs venues would right approach. 

We‚Äôd possibly fewer dead. wouldn‚Äôt more. Except economy wouldn‚Äôt fucked wouldn‚Äôt negative psychological trauma. Fauci start Twitch channel daily updates. Trump can't appear involved he's ""hateful conduct"". Twitter rants spectacular. That's pretty awesome. say say fire you. Bam. make money now. oh yeah thats probably we're selfish decades neoliberal capitalism stagnating wages subsidising production cheap garbage food That‚Äôs disappointing. Madison area probably 80-90% masks experience looking people go stores.

Edited add: Dance county require masks indoor spaces besides home (and restaurants, sigh) starting Monday. great news. Wait sec TSHHHH?

&amp;#x200B;

anyways, take updoot I'm really curious this. jaw surgery lost ~15 lbs 8 days barely eating. weighed 180lbs point, 165 lbs post surgery. regained pretty quickly month though.

I daily variation +/- 2 lbs now, even accounting max normal variation measurements I'd minimum still 10 lbs lost 9 days. Would weight loss water weight?

I believe losing 50lbs week without taking tissue something, could see low high teens. Oh completely agree base going grow, continue erode. extent people vote R trump matter what, population people growing right now, fact shrinking due people getting fed deciding ""ANYONE guy"" else people dying old age covid stuff. population supporters capped erode via attrition. means people *wouldn't* died. That's positive trump. wants people die. enjoys it. No, could've implemented proper mitigation strategies sooner. could've implemented mask requirements sooner. could've stressed potential lethality disease sooner. like came nowhere. reports going back early December Chinese cities battling anti-body test research alluded possibility individuals infected US early then, well. personally lost loved one covid? see people celebrating ""success"" can't help feel dead one step closer forgotten. :/ Except Pence. Maybe Pence told wear it. Well he's saying everyone needs wearing masks public since way back times. Dunno people acting like big deal something. Maybe antifa terrorists making fuss couple dead grandmas, would've opportunities stand face anti-mask hysteria left keeps stirring up. giant FUCK naysayers, wears face cape way extremely clever beautiful American man could. Leading example always easy, cutting oxygen, putting life line American people another day lung capacity Olympic swimmer. Fuck haters. Mask Jesus! Yeah I'm making soon.

 something kind similar crimini shallots cooked pretty soft olive oil, lot oil, half steamed really, cook small amount cilantro tarragon those, put rice, wilted watercress rest cilantro top shrooms mixture really good cheese, big broken chunks. That's ""winter food"". Might chicken rabbit bits sometimes cooked super clean usually Enjoy bubble.    Yeah, understand perception China let virus run rampant report it. near unlimited capacity infrastructure supply PPE cleaning supplies population since produce entire world.

Just countries, reaction spread delayed followed swift, albeit harsh, action. People complain want China cooking numbers read reaction it, think likely. Meanwhile, multiple states US exactly suggested. Aw fuck point world never going back normal amazing! Thank you!!!

Now let's make sure spread around much can.  Production probably completed. revealed hour long rally next week Go office couple times week hours time. rest time I'm ""working"" home. getting pretty good rocket league. Definitely spoiled lol work anyways Americans stupid act like can't go two days without KFC shit. Secluding house two weeks like asking God give superpowers. Never gonna happen. Great job..... keep visiting CDC site tells usual bullshit. 

I mean nice easy read timeline events would useful time like this.... Jesus Christ. Americans: 120 degrees F think. someone facebook mommy group told so.  Ridiculous.  ton voters die November, it‚Äôs gonna bit tougher ~~get re-elected~~ rig election.  culling said herd.  common misconception mask use that‚Äôs actually well studied hospitals long covid19 thing. It‚Äôs equally effective ways really deep dive available research. Agreed, what's funny could easily seen mask Symbol ...

A gun defend home, mask defend Economy.

Would easy sell. ""Repel lockdown"", ""Defend Economy""

Have couple marines holding m16's wearing masks.... would unAmerican wear one. *Second World warn 99% harmless... hear new Disney rides Die I've never flu husband got time horrible. hit like truck. tested positive Influenza take urgent care trouble breathing O2 sats low. get chest xrays, O2 treatment inhaler. 35, healthy, underlying conditions.


All say, want see COVID would like. Everybody ""its flu"". Flu pretty bad.


Edit: also, got trip Disney. Lol. would love that, son want take away dad, maybe he's old enough decide himself. Hawaii sounds amazing. Oh. That... way expecting go? see video pro Trump seniors vs anti Trump seniors senior community protest?

It hilarious

The pro Trump seniors rode golf carts street yelling stuff anti Trump seniors yelling stuff golf carts. Yeah theyre shit paid ppl want either. write corporate tho. scares think China's figures are, US hit 1%. guy that‚Äôs delivering pizza Mesa Az 
About 1 10 see don‚Äôt wear mask. main problem I‚Äôm seeing people use mask shit walk gas station touching door touch food phone rip mask hand bundle throw pocket soon walk out. I‚Äôm gonna die man. Really shit time live grandparents. get joke, work. knows damned well he's getting single vote already voted him, would vote along party lines. He's converting voters. Thats right, Ders. act win shiny toaster courtesy Sears Roebuck!!  okey dudette.. : )

and seriously.. nonelection 2016 pretty much clueless government works.  ..this steep learning curve but.. rachel maddow really really helped me! 

so okay... won‚Äôt leave even tho murdering mob thug want stuff? wow. well, shouldnt surprised trump traitor america. couple studies postulate virus spreading significantly faster longer ever imagined. one Penn state one immediate access to: saw couple others Spain Brazil took sewage samples determined could community spreading countries early December January. One mentioned next goal analyze hospital admissions excess mortality timeframe find correlation. Obviously none sure, evidence mounting.

Combined often rona asymptomatic effortlessly spreads indoors.. wouldn‚Äôt surprised real numbers infected 10x more. Especially former current hotspot states like AZ NY. I'm driven absolutely fucking crazy. dad, works transport hub, WILL.NOT.STOP.COUGHING.LOUDLY.OPENLY.WITHOUT.COVERING.HIS.MOUTH

Everytime tell cover mouth, gets pissed shouts me. He's coughed atleast 10 times past 10 minutes loudly openly makes zero effort cover mouth


He asking ""stop treating like diseased man"". Gosh, atleast paranoid atleats allowed use thermometer. think 50+ middle aged diabetic high BP like would know better openly cough everywhere. also guy sprays ethyl alcohol spray 10-20 times stuff comes back office.


I know sound super ranty, driving crazy. He's like month even trying cover mouth best anology people think herd immunity legitimate strategy üòÇ anything 98.9. make wanting stay home work/school suck? Heat disease kills 650,000 people per year US. Cancer kills 600,000. seems like appropriate comparisons since anyone get diseases military members serving WW1 could get killed fighting WW1. Meanwhile Melbourne we're 2nd lock 6 weeks.
Our first one 4 weeks.

Wouldnt doubt picks comment same. agree like this. acted early could prevented this. 


Also (137,000 (deaths US)/3,000,000(official cases US))*100 = 4.5% see math would change reflect 100 less accurate given numbers. numbers cases could way higher since admin decided test know real numbers are. strategy ""Cross fingers hope"", 15 Days Slow Spread phased reopening plan states follow. Fauci responsibly issued oodles guidance ignored. 

What little useful guidance Fauci offered weeks late, exhausted incorrect guidance could seemingly come with. Even stopped clock eventually right, make hero.

He literally us nothing throughout January February. testing. stockpiling supplies. monitoring travelers. Nothing. entire strategy trust China, hope virus turned relatively harmless like MERS Ebola ( places modern living conditions ).

He dead case, he'd job. 

He be. saying Trump rational hires fires, going strongly says wait two weeks downward case trends reopening people don't, that's fault. 

Why anyone trust given track record? That's point. made complete clusterfuck job point he's useless, needs least fired, preferably World reopened today. Florida case numbers going wild. Fauci applauding that, he's probably appalled, *no power* stop it.

He did, squandered power uncountable mistakes throughout first quarter year. Again, that's also obsessive much money guy makes.

Well, volunteer, would expect many mistakes. He's decidedly not, however, expect level competence fallen miles short interest attracting *the best* people position, rates compete private sector. hell salary, even half much, could attract level talent.

You irony talking action President took two years earlier, directly effected Mr Fauci's area professional responsibility.




Feel free provide citations prove Fauci aware Trump did. Try use reputable source instead opinion articles. suggest could possibly aware action ridiculous actually lack words describe stupidity, that's saying something.






I'll keep waiting citations. finished trying educate you.





The notion could educate anything hilarious. nothing wrote accurate true, increasingly suspect -- read - aware that.




The irony never much better next time, attempt frighteningly sad.




But wait. There's more. Dude hard - nobody deserves called names. least realize made mistakes brave enough admit it...now correct it. Stay home much wear mask public. Holy shit. Hello fellow NMOer! mean, believe, idiot politicians lobbyists pockets self-serving agendas, someone education expertise talk subject matter truthful manner? mean, come on, tv tells listen politicians like know talking about. I‚Äôd agree. teacher often feel frustrated lack ability many students engage critical thinking. everyone, many people way. Age nothing it. primes people obedience cooperation, it‚Äôs always good thing. Still, thank god helped us keep Covid bay. Oh agree totally. things would happened would great. I‚Äôm saying gives zero fucks people think. *were

LMAOO Yep expecting March April.. guess lasted longer imagined. We‚Äôre screwed big time ‚ÄûSir, say families scared?‚Äú

‚ÄûThis nasty question. bad reporter‚Äú  Move dont carw real! Lmaaooo ‚ÄòSad true. Germany has...‚Äô pride lions passing front highway, going wait pass like ""it's democrat bs, I'm going pass road"" know there‚Äôs blizzard coming say please don‚Äôt drive won‚Äôt able rescue efforts puts first responders risk? Well Texas big ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù 580 medical personnel families return to. notice dig out. unfortunate? real joke many dipshits hear talking ‚Äúhopefully reach herd immunity soon.‚Äù  Listen numbnuts, requires like least 80% nation infected, like 266 million people. think that‚Äôs going happen soon? hospitals could handle that? mention aren‚Äôt even sure point antibodies anything. Honestly might well test symptoms again. need speed get test results limiting feels necessary. Fucking manipulative ploy distract political self-serving reasons. trump over. see thinks hes got us hoodwinked. Embarrassingly dumb as. like comments. informative, know drop F bomb right emphasis. use sound crass drunk.

Thank adding sub.  think people buying houses moving lockdown conditions?

You‚Äôre one who‚Äôs depth here...  depends highly location. thighs. hurt sometimes, like knife stabbing, definitely bearable. top 10 illness stretch. sister torso, assures misery reading above. wayyyyy cases that. spreading around world January. likely thousands upon thousands people thought cold another group people never symptoms. Comparing 60 cases 100 cases January ridiculous Almost comical ""dipshit"" said used ""Karen"" wrong. fucking idiot. I‚Äôm happy Deaths ticking like based estimated infection mortality rates estimated time infection death. 

In fact states (and whole countries matter) cases skyrocketing daily death totals actually dropping. makes sense unless case numbers completely uncoupled actual number infections. 

As non-death issues related COVID, what? There's vaccine coming save day here. pandemic waaay far advanced make lick difference point, especially true actual rate infection vastly higher confirmed cases. Honestly almost way explain discrepancy case count death count. 

As lag death rates, argument weak. median time infection reporting death might approach 4 weeks, there's effing way detectable increase four weeks. median time all, minimum.  matter now! Lmaaoooo guy work wears one everyday, along hat.  Yes. EPL well. ESPN natural sound first MLS game Fox enhanced crowd noise tonight‚Äôs match listening Olivia Newton-John this. watching grease one teacher. doesn‚Äôt care anyone himself, I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs one that‚Äôs sick problem us cares much econemy saving lives. 

Our country built upon capitalism greed. care health care system collapsing. care innocent people dying. 

We want econemy run matter costs. sad, reality. 

I envy European countries. know America citizens became way. literally become OBSESSED money. NO. FUCKING. SHIT.. Definitely tool use. I'm gonna rely confidence reduce precautions. think *may* disproportionate effect among toolkit. times global pandemics, country would surge general. Comparing Stalinist Russia putting piece fabric part face people catch disease die ignorant hell. Fucking Christ. people *wore them* spiraling control. government clearly intentions making cohesive standard plan, certain states arent anything all, continue richochet around country people die. Wear mask. Listen travel restrictions. hard literally save lives.

Now tipline people wearing masks - public health emergency. crime stopper tiplines right? person committing crime dangerous, wearing mask. cause physical harm even death. like mask wearing causes changes law ""slippery slope"" future. virus. Wear mask. Shame maybe loved ones die. Contact tracing testing also required alongside lockdown ..... Lockdown enough. Italy Spain good examples countries got control situation control.

Contact tracing testing done scale involves investment, effort discipline.

In India situation Dharavi slum Mumbai example achieved thing called tinder, need bar find someone bang anymore. still old fashion way wrong lol. Seriously, I'm glad guy dead can't infect anyone else no-mask-wearing ass. Tracking chip injections must going better planned!  probably tested positive can't assume school (with new precautions) lead higher viral load reflected current stats, include super-spreader events occurring people started taking precautions.

Ironically school closures forcing parents move parents in, someone babysit kids mom dad work. overall effect closures may increase Covid deaths preventing elderly self-isolating.  *Retarded president April? close 3 million people middle April means infections likely March. newsbreak.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Got plenty beds tho. states went lockdown vast majority states basically locked nothing pro-active preparation eventually re-open.

A melt-blown fabric factory simple making n95 material. think every single state could invested money creating mask factories supply proper masks everyone? Instead, PPE cleaning chemicals limited supply across country.

It simply reopening fast. wasted time everything shut down. Masks making people crazy. acting literal criminals. joked someone gives grief mask, I‚Äôll tell flew Wuhan (I‚Äôm Chinese America) feeling unwell. trump likes stress Chinese flu followers must least believe Chinese people get it, right? Maybe one lawyers advised keep mouth shut election over. 99% go! Protesters taking risks attempt stop blatant, consequence-free victimization human beings police.

People Disneyworld taking risks get picture Goofy. think may hate DeSantis even hate Trump. even live anywhere near Florida. hahahah  crude mortality rate CMR. link: ‚ÄûNote Crude Mortality Rate continue increase infections deaths occur‚Äú

The infection fatality rate IFR 1.4 %. Herd immunity needs 60-70% infected. 1.4% 65% 330 Million inhabitants would 300,000 deaths. think point need go full Karen here. DeSantis deserves pleasantries. 5 months late. Wonder Federal response also take account electoral votes polling data? Hope not.  friend also obsessed spent money annual pass like nearly thousand dollars complaining short rent....  Ya 5 year old attending school first months possibly whole year.

They mandating masks kids way social distance. Pretty much no. Trump administration failed unprecedented level anything appropriate useful. So, didn‚Äôt need money. would followers say/do? pull out, blow bottom connector, reinsert

( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) agree, point they're concerned pride health well-being child. Yes wtf. lot states refusing count patients COVID hospitalizations deaths havent tested.

Its actually really fucking die right now. Texas barely beds left, Florida almost 100% ICU capacity.  300+ symptoms Celiac, that's sometimes takes 10+ years get diagnosed. 
Not mention 80% Celiac undiagnosed!!! simply doesn‚Äôt matter them. People die people. Money important. believe instead vaccine traced 5g going doctors getting weakened version virus stimulate antibody response help immune system! teacher, already thrown situation. returning school pretext kids need social emotional interaction school well-rounded academic citizens. reality traditional school doesn‚Äôt start, childcare number people. can‚Äôt fully open economy kids don‚Äôt babysitters. 

Let‚Äôs reopen schools safe so. I‚Äôm convinced someone willing write number teacher/staff deaths ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù open economy. EF ever recorded prior COVID diagnosis?  Thank America, cool. mean... medical center. Every time press conference something. Something ""medical center"" makes mask official. like he's doctor's ability thwart covid. European countries? Shit, envy Canada. followers must confused right now. funding agencies/politicians appropriate funds didn‚Äôt care.

They actually did, pandemic response better Sars1 actually eliminated virus wild fairly quickly. Without infected people left study, anything really useful spend money on.

There's really one assign blame Sars1 research drying up, unless want 'blame' pandemic response teams good job quickly eliminating it. 

Unfortunately, likely going lots opportunity study Sars2. talking about?

Sure mate, letting reader form unbiased opinion instead including news article? reading column opinionist know?

For someone thinks objective ""journal"", behaving exactly someone watches fox news would: yell, offer zero proof I'm saying real. good question police wearing masks convinces idiots ok wear one. bad enough certain president doesnt wear one.

If today people told polio v2 back vaccine, think people would take way way seriously. Every non-anti vaxxer Karens would start screaming people wear mask. anti-mask beliefs probably resulted others getting infected. concerned else got infected.

UK lockdown pretty much fake (US style). But... flu!!! /s wont, people dont see important. UK mixed messages effectiveness masks beginning. UK govt back Feb telling us wear masks could increase infection rates. lot people still opinion masks useless UK shit messaging govt. admitted many cities are?

Feel free list many Florida cities accepting covid patients back nursing homes think Boris gambling Oxford vaccine ready soon many people die then.

It's stupid gamble care people die then, even account time taken vaccinate people refuse it, think trying cake (opening economy) eat (not suffer US levels death).

He wrong, Brits ignorant, going die thousands. Guessing whole aus vaccinated end September then? Instrumental ok. practice indoors, keep masks conversations. People know show feel well, even sore throat, felt fine became symptomatic ward call everyone immediately, infectiousness estimated peak 0.7 days prior symptoms onset.

Taking numbers weekend/Monday comparing weekday aren‚Äôt isn‚Äôt really fair comparison. numbers ALWAYS lower due lags reporting etc. average death rate around 130/150 day 2 weeks now.

Over infection rate hasn‚Äôt seen new surge I‚Äôve got fingers crossed I‚Äôm hopeful. Finland amusement parks open month now.

And single digit new cases weeks now. 37 new cases 0 new deaths last week, 0 patients ICU. Well, agenda whatsoever. hope successful say.

Since cases dramatically decreased steadily opening time cases continue fall. However cases European countries peak higher later takes time cases clear up.

We nationwide testing system allows order free test symptoms aims get results 48 hours, largely seems working. positive test contacted contact tracers find anyone may contact contact tell isolate, they've contacted 100,000 people far. Estimates suggest system catching half new daily covid cases country (around 600-700 estimated 1500 cases).

Recently pubs restaurants reopened lots protective measures, example must pre-book table, everywhere supports app ordering, tables spaced screened other, pub contact information groups there. Staff wear masks people room stay spaced time. Also rules strict share table table indoors. pub twice felt safe.

As country we're moving national lockdown localised lockdowns, example one city recently found cases normal, lockdown measures lifted yet. Also smaller outbreaks addressed moving mobile testing centres test everyone area. highest deaths per 100,000 world.

Clearly promising vaccine speaking, closed things ""under control"". me, means low enough numbers successfully contact trace vast majority cases.

Countries really testing every potential cases due shortage tests. really treat numbers percentage chance dying disease. accurate showing differences age groups though. 

Like Sweden, numbers from, randomized testing 1,800 people largest city outbreak, found around 10% tested positive. 

That would mean least 98,000 cases instead documented 21907 cases.

when pandemic made partisan issue, largely early one party decided paint hoax, side alarmist, president double that, supporters leaned it. large part problem people refusing participate containment measures. 

To appeal political party, president, base bought partisan bullshit, governor Florida decided essentially ignore pandemic. scores political points people bought ""virus hoax, I'm going wear mask!

The economic angle another one that's pushed part political party want economy better election later year, economy can't better people quarantined self isolating. suppress data situation people less informed thus less willing choose self isolate avoid going work. also part things like try limit end unemployment benefits time, big part trying get people back schools. 

The push send kids back school entirely economic choice. children school, parents free return work. also paints picture normalcy make people complacent idea returning work. 

The bottom line greed. Either greed power greed money. expense lives. Many years ago pleasure meet Fauci university.

We're lucky him. bad deal moron top. Honestly leaving middle seat empty seems like safety theater. Going plane risky whether seat empty occupied. Testing needs increase proportionally cases. useful metric percentage tests come back positive - higher percentage tests positive, know testing. mostly tests short supply generally test people symptoms (i.e.: someone mild headache get tested enough people show ICU flu like symptoms). Anything 10% big problem, means surely testing enough people mild symptoms symptoms all.

 Right Florida, Arizona, Texas getting well 20% positive. days, counties, surpassing 30%. shows testing wildly insufficient number cases. kids learn anything makes unprepared. side note, kids can't go back school, parents can't go back work. can't say ""you're wrong,"" classes vouch you, \*most\* teachers teach jack. really appreciate including slow learners US maybe consider limit least little bit.

You‚Äôre scientist  neighborhoods Bronx 68% infected true number infected NY north 3 million people. fucking crazy. Florida government truly failed citizens. 

The governor saying shits control. Netherlands past peak start June, no? friends say things getting back track life regaining sort normalcy. hope staying safe worst behind Watching sport players hazmat suits would entertaining think Sweden didn‚Äôt social distance, didn‚Äôt lockdown, infection run nursing homes but, even coronavirus sub god Cuomo problem. 

I think that‚Äôs heading, let virus run it‚Äôs course begin didn‚Äôt think Desantis bad Hitler, turns is. Check Florida Snapchat map feature. saw snap last night Miami police trying shut hear guy say something effect of....y‚Äôall trying tell us go home, don‚Äôt y‚Äôall go home.‚Äù People don‚Äôt care. don‚Äôt care breadwinner can‚Äôt afford lose paycheck. don‚Äôt care business go shut again. don‚Äôt care baby underlying issue could die. don‚Äôt care could bring virus back families. knew number coming watched buffet style, non mask wearing, social distancing party July 4th Snapchat. It‚Äôs gone idiotic criminal.

Edit: spelling Sanitizers back store shelves past month two. NY peaking, majority tests country done NY.

EDIT: I'm wrong this, think. testing ~30k cases peaked.

EDIT2: time US testing 150k per day, NY made 20% nation's testing time. Definitely majority. wearing medical reason understandable, though saying things like wear mask, without context justification, likely met contempt time people scared loved ones.

On lighter note, totally get cutting much possible. Unfortunately can't easily get groceries delivered big shop weekend always harrowing experience. say glad Scotland (where I'm at) bringing requirement masks supermarkets. live dad much ""at risk"" category, I'll take much help avoid passing something possible.

Sorry giving hard time :) I‚Äôve heard every one lies come arguing dad healthcare run like Canada. Sorry. people questioning getting skin. never posted this, it‚Äôs soon. Good God, I'm speechless...  lol that‚Äôs literally every disease fuck? Exactly. spike winter begins disastrous. anecdote nice, unless able back claim arizonans recovering faster, majority ""mild"". mean fucks sake order refridgerated trucks store bodies currently filling morgues capacity. doesnt happen mild. remember live world still air, move world people previously were, indoor outdoor fresh air intake different allowing less particle density build time, etc etc. hey, 6' lab controlled environment sure. u/tastybread saying, pretty much need big pharmaceutical company distribution. They're best positioned manufacture deploy huge quantities drug fast possible. It'll logistical challenge even them. ""But already made weekend plans"" lacto-ovo vegetarian (my diet nowhere near restrictive vegans), confirm people forget time. rude care, rather meat consumption norm people generally think stuff outside norms. also people believe I'm risking health consuming meat try convince eat meat gatherings. Again, coming position caring due misguided sense concern well-being. instances I've politely remind people time time consume meat. I'm trying brag dietary choices make topic conversation, rather remind choice try dish due personal dietary/moral choices I'm rude dont like cooking. said, also militant dietary restrictions something choose would never proselytize others try force them. Likewise, environment calls meat consumption occasion eaten meat despite cooking meat (situations dinner put one aunts overseas lives poverty went way slaughter one goats visit part custom/tradition). true. that's comparison im making. Maybe 'sentiment' wasnt right word use. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è countries low humidity , live UAE humidity 60% today.. guess talking without knowing facts. told [not] to!‚Äù forgetting one thing. owned libs. tell shit. share fox article.

Oh, wait, no, did.

Also hot AF new england. turned AC two weeks. Businesses moreso. becoming bigger bigger news. Good news that..... masks politicized doesn‚Äôt happen vacuum it‚Äôs disingenuous completely lay blame Fauci‚Äôs feet, though don‚Äôt necessarily disagree last statement. Bold think I've met 100 people That's unsure of. thought might like medical supremacy type thing hospital doctors charge hospital top hospital. Cause know nuclear power stuff able put foot pretty hard I'm surprised wear chin. finally tested positive Talk radio hosts. Which, incidentally, tend dovetail sorts career politicians instigating this. Roger Stone people would stop talking Bill Barr gutting ED NY. angry sad, Trump wearing mask.

That‚Äôs people enjoy. understand appeal it, course. good sort consensus IFR. go one place might bad assumption bad data. see everyone else 0.5-1.0 CDC outside that, pretty safely disregard. mechanism place shut interstate travel India figured out. USA could done well. replies twitter thread saying ""the left stop wearing masks trump decided wear one.""

right politics brainless, holy shit. Maybe someone told Trump [almost 1% America thought said, ""*the* 1% getting infected."" it‚Äôs not.

It‚Äôs embarrassing, it‚Äôs vulgar. points:

1) deaths ticking up

2) deaths likely hospital systems strained. surge isn‚Äôt concentrated one metro area anymore it‚Äôs taken time saturate hospitals. reaching saturation, it‚Äôs going get worse. 

3) it‚Äôs literally insane care deaths number primary, secondary tertiary issues arise increasing case counts. Reduced access healthcare ‚Äúnormal‚Äù non-COVID issues, increased morbidity due deferred care, burnout healthcare workers, ongoing syndromes post ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù didn‚Äôt die, economic impacts (which occur naturally without government intervention) physical emotional welfare entire population, list goes on. 

4) deaths going lag testing improved turnaround diagnosis. Yeah, photos it. sobering. whole killing people pyro indoor venue thing.  imagine scenario doctors refuse jeopardize health soldiers care? Blue Black‚Äî Kenny Wayne Shepard God spent like 5 minutes reading Twitter replies want claw eyes thats cool dont care... Word given hospital staff they're over-reporting COVID deaths means money bottom line. 

(I spent two half days sitting various areas local hospital Detroit area, finally able get testing done. plenty time BS various nurses went process. That's story got several them. Take it, leave it.) [If held appointed elected officials personally know 6 different couples/roommates one tested positive negative. None showed symptoms. ball gag I‚Äôm sure person realizes knee push-ups are. obviously haven‚Äôt figured I‚Äôm female. Still trying find out. Family dynamic sucks talk couple siblings. States masks ‚Äúwork‚Äù presently lower humidity Florida Texas. Check Fall cold weather States mask rules spikes. rights like everybody else Constitution I'm used disappointment. Unlike many scientists spent lot time corporate america. I've seen things would make politicians blush. 

I'm disappointed Fauci did, think trying make sure around provide guidance instead getting sidelined ""in first quarter"". statistically correct don‚Äôt know long term affects fuck face fuck right piece shit science denier Yep, learned yesterday Twitter via professor follow. glad see estimates get line science consensus. Wait, wore mask instantly die? guess fake news masks make us suffocate?  What? it. U U A

How terrifying  Honestly though, it, complaints.  Scrolled far find someone mentioning this! He‚Äôs got biggest scowl face, like held forced secret service put mask immediately photo op.  We're hoping. works me. actually prefer Trump's Razor ""Given number choices, Trump do/say dumbest possible option."" ""Brain fog, fatigue, difficulty concentrating""

Have Post Covid whole life? Becuase hes lying little late, Mariposa. Ah ok. lgbtq community fit White ethno state? Yea. He‚Äôs one stuffed elderly patients covid nursing homes, causing mass deaths. Oh wait, Deblasio. Nah. package deal. opened one, trump plaza, actually going really well. cleared 21 mil profit first year. got greedy. opened second one, castle Trump something dumb. one even going decided buy unfinished construction project called Taj Mahal cost $1billion total finish. borrow 600 million fund it, since already pretty much jacked tits debt casinos 1&amp;2 remember - well - went bond market borrowed money 14% interest!!! That‚Äôs INSANE basically ensured unless cleared $1mil daily profits, couldn‚Äôt pay back debt. Well seeing single casino ever done that, pretty idiotic. 

But wait - there‚Äôs more. bought plaza hotel ‚ÄúI look every day office window, I‚Äôd upset knowing someone else bought it.‚Äù. dug hole another half billion so. stretched thin forced years settle bankers sell assets loss, bankrupting taj people couldn‚Äôt come unpaid contracts.

So didn‚Äôt bankrupt 3 casinos, bankrupted one massive bankruptcy forced liquidate them. seemed believe infinite number people gambling AC. Greed hell drug. There's definitely point acceptable risk, consider acceptable bear risk killed drive school every morning. comes finer points point is, inclined trust experts. Scotland we're pretty good point right now. initially planning go back two days week, cases one confirmed case per million population day average, r number estimated 0.6-0.8, things stay track they're they're going send back full time. feel quite comfortable that--obviously cases still there, rare risk seems much aforementioned risk car accident. That's...very different situation Texas Florida. armed security guard door business able keep remove violate rules. Knowingly spreading deadly disease illegal... maybe start prosecuting guys instead. already seen two town. Makes sick. would think levels would decrease body would able increase levels quickly reinfection happens. That‚Äôs wonder about. countries inherently low humidity desert. even indoors humidity lower. Additionally still infected people air conditioning spread virus. infected people room it‚Äôs irrelevant. That‚Äôs situation, condo Florida, going months possibly years, staying home everyone‚Äôs health. crazy. viral infection August started sore throat, really bad fever flu light symptoms duration, coming cough got worse would spike 99-100F evening (that lasted another week half first wave sick), coughed hard coughing blood morning, felt hard breathe, went doctor several times tested negative flu, strep, mono. lost 10lb (and never gained back) first 2 months spent good 3 months could get one flight stairs without feeling winded. getting dizzy left right tapered fatigue did. bizarre, guess maybe there's chance similar mechanism. say sucked. go work whole month (could work home) taxing cough bad. made scared shitless catching COVID going again. almost year later still watch stuff like caffeine feels like drains me. feeling COVID cases end taking solid year feel like they're completely past it. haven‚Äôt resort population level testing yet. first begin testing. ive seen like 10 people last 2 months  Lol What's logo it? city block probably lol news coverage way top. remember felt like every news station loop weeks. 12 happened know I'll afraid crowds rest life. Wasn‚Äôt Folsom jail? bad education costs much days. fall victim greed. don‚Äôt think intended stupid :( Years* Trump gets COVID-19 survives, could become even unstable. That's terrifying thought. OP username checks going piss lot people off.

Glass half full.. rate virus possibly around long. one, thanks, hovering around 97, far good! ""Schools need open, else! Everything fine!""

*guy never wears mask puts mask on* Maybe recognize bring bounties Russia put them, fact Trump still helps vouches Putin Hopefully anti-mask dummies copy stop pretending masks deadly. 99.9% survival rate I'm watching carefully. didn‚Äôt claim one Student doctor here, run anyone says this, tell actual expert told literally zero health conditions preclude able wear mask public. nothing prevent one's ability oxygenate. ""i health condition""... condition clinically stupid. Wear masks folks. Provide source? known.. would arguments myself...you know goes right.. single person wrong thankfully left earth.. remains seems image..i admit damn hard one. another 1% worry now.  !remindme 2 weeks I've seen plenty without masks indoors still 90% wearing them. Yesterday Wegmans dumbass walking aisle drinking half gallon chocolate milk... They're still parliamentary republic, I'll believe India's data originates CCP day.  I'm Air Force vet, too, know talking 100%. You‚Äôre onto something. alleged reinfection Pakistan got posted time last week supposedly person got infected strains. people stop wearing seatbelts logic Welcomed who? national government there? would US. don't. Media freedom taken massive fall lately, houses except NDTV simpering sycophants like Republic Zee TV.

Besides, like Yogi record throwing journalists out. Remember happened one broke scandal Varanasi families reduced eating grass? Wait wouldn‚Äôt take vaccine pandemic? Let get straight - vaccine available, works, wouldn‚Äôt take it? 

There legit people probably won‚Äôt able take health reasons. people take it, chance folks cannot get vaccinated getting sick goes down. 

You‚Äôre selfish. Actually work excel sheet mine little different testing numbers since adds positive negative tests. 98,708 instead 99,003. said yesterday numbers spreadsheet, appears difference comes fact using ""total people tested"" number get total test results. number includes tests results pending inconclusive. use newly added tests results obtained (new positive + new negative). also way COVID Tracking Project it. 2020 taught anything country, never trust police, employer, government call leaders. I‚Äôm curious use Discord help tracking organizing! please expand that? trailed almost three weeks peak peak, Florida peaks, three weeks later Florida death peak, assuming states delay death report.

Florida deaths today compared Florida daily cases three weeks ago would good guide figure many fifteen thousand eventually die thus close NY numbers Maybe want bad press reporting 3 days once. Yeah want do? We're trying best. fuckers gonna wear mask matter Good article, worth read.  OR! dont even make excuse infers thing would wearing mask say ""Hey, care health health people care about. unfortunate dont feel way doesnt change feel keeping safe myself."" Houston sure hell could use don‚Äôt know, like knowing saying groups mean groups. example read article said something like (and yes I‚Äôm making up) ‚Äúviral load transmission much lower asymptomatic carriers‚Äù, would assume include presymptomatic carriers went develop symptoms. **Abstract**

**Importance** coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused worldwide sudden substantial increase hospitalizations pneumonia multiorgan disease. review discusses current evidence regarding pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, management COVID-19.

**Observations** SARS-CoV-2 spread primarily via respiratory droplets close face-to-face contact. Infection spread asymptomatic, presymptomatic, symptomatic carriers. average time exposure symptom onset 5 days, 97.5% people develop symptoms within 11.5 days. common symptoms fever, dry cough, shortness breath. Radiographic laboratory abnormalities, lymphopenia elevated lactate dehydrogenase, common, nonspecific. Diagnosis made detection SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur 20% 67% patients; however, dependent quality timing testing. Manifestations COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers fulminant disease characterized sepsis acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% patients COVID-19, 20% hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. 75% patients hospitalized COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment individuals COVID-19 includes best practices supportive management acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 \[95% CI, 0.74-0.92\]) remdesivir improves time recovery (hospital discharge supplemental oxygen requirement) 15 11 days. randomized trial 103 patients COVID-19, convalescent plasma shorten time recovery. Ongoing trials testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, anticoagulants. case-fatality rate COVID-19 varies markedly age, ranging 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 17 years 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years older US. Among patients hospitalized intensive care unit, case fatality 40%. least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines development. effective vaccine available, primary methods reduce spread face masks, social distancing, contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies.

**Conclusions Relevance** July 1, 2020, 10 million people worldwide infected SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects transmission, infection, treatment remain unclear. Advances prevention effective management COVID-19 require basic clinical investigation public health clinical interventions. say die it. diehard followers yell name claiming hoax. get people start believing facts/evidence one blindly follow get point? #DILDOBAGGINS6969 FTW.

#WHERE FUCK HAZARD PAY!!!!??? simultaneously good bad news...as 15k probably consists lot backlogged tests true 1 day total. time, backlog growing shows can't test enough we're actually probably catching cases. civilized response that... SMH ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è earlier percent positive numbers difficult compare numbers much testing capacity made available general public (not easily, available). NY wasn‚Äôt possible someone get line get test felt like it. start restricting testing people legit exposure symptoms, you‚Äôre gonna positive rate spike bigly. mom pulled one 4th July. ‚ÄúWell cant disappoint them!‚Äù 


You could stop planning stuff every weekend though...  dummies: stopped testing. testing much NY now, that's surging.

No. deliberately spreading misinformation.

[State trends time, ordered total York: Population: 19M 
+376,974 tests since last week

Florida: Population: 21M 
+275,100 tests since last week

[Daily reported tests positive rate decreasing, 19% Repost /s us idiots. don‚Äôt like living people either. it‚Äôs countries people compare USA aren‚Äôt really fair. differ far much size, population, geography culture/experience viruses reasonably expect similar outcome USA. mind countries dealt well that‚Äôs fair comparison USA Germany USAs opportunity like went long time ago. 

However UK similar situation USA months ago due sticking lockdown (Which think slightly stricter average one USA) situation completely different much similar countries dealt well.

Both OP also British well that‚Äôs reason comparison country. that, like evicting get landlords income back. Evicting leads vacancy, still nets income landlord. many people able pay, nobody renting vacant property anytime soon. Yeah trend continues, tomorrow won‚Äôt fun continues jump possible, obvious that's he's doing. Air Force vet here. def don‚Äôt care people. preach time, definitely see caring virus likely view ‚Äúflu‚Äù. lot right leaning people join military, they‚Äôre ones anti mask. 2 cents. 400 desserts sounds lovely right now. Much better deaths. already edited previous comment. Well, fuck people then. mean sincerely. Might well kick back underage drinking watch go shite far already Mouse wants dead. money. video one lakers players yesterday players grabbing food front doors seconds placed staff still elevator waiting close go down, none players masks on.

in time droplets could still air, masks aren‚Äôt 100% effective containing droplets.

also it‚Äôs maintenance staff, players could put tracking band bed sneak night, sneak someone in. actually going pretty boring. statistics excess deaths out. pretty much paint picture death counts do. course, countries count stuff covid19 countries. saying one country worse another +20% death capita misleading.

However, that's saying. I'm saying: Countries handled corona virus well months bad numbers (lots new cases, lots deaths) new cases new deaths.

Also believe media would simply report sudden spike deaths countries. numbers might order magnitude, two. Republicans hideously short-sighted, shocking. time national strike. can't evict everyone. exactly. I‚Äôll add chickenpox example virus people don‚Äôt get infected multiple times, happen occasionally. Regardless still able get vaccine-related herd immunity many places. side effect even thought of. can't imagine tension going cause countries start telling us can't station troops get shit together. absolutely infuriating country well containing Coronavirus, us mess sending infected troops there. They're kind independent basically longer virus lasts host better spread. Haha thanks, best it. also keep mind people new york time tested thought symptoms reason to.

So going ""substantially"" higher, rest people still locked homes afraid go outside. People actually took stay home order much seriously fellow countrymen Florida. asymptomatic. Much hotter That‚Äôs problem bureaucracy, everyone wants know steps government spending many hoops jump get things done quickly.  understand hope affordable enough everyone well Omg fucking this. Whenever someone tells death rate low, feel sense complete awe stupid person be.

‚ÄúYeah, well, percentage people die losing limb super low.‚Äù

I mean, basically. literally zero chance. sure looking minimum turn worked yet. Thanks, appreciate it. wish could flush shitheads toilet belong üí© believe way around---Japan pay handsomely American ""protection"". cover herpes sores? Thank yo! also wear mask helps contribute normalcy wearing mask ease anxiety around worried getting sick. Nyet thank Yea saying Washington hit hard simply true. nursing home got wiped extent it. 

They didn‚Äôt get 800, even 200 deaths ever day. mayor trolling everyone? Came say terrorism better job. Even masks required enforcement law enforcement says job mask police hand citations can. crazy. Never claimed fixed rate saying would take long time till herd immunity achieved whole lot deaths. That's North American trait. big stores open almost everywhere hand washing stations limits number people entering. stories US marines vile shit Okinawa nothing coming it

What mean? Spoonfeed me, please. Positivity rate 21% last time checked.

I'll tell 5 minutes. would, anti-vaccine movement barely exists UK. field hospital thing another shit show. nursing home EO deliberated field hospitals still constructed Army jurisdiction Feds. plan get go admit non-COVID patients overflow (so I'm sure viable option NH pts decision made). stupid choice though, later changed hospitals complained needed capacity COVID patients. changed soon enough facilities never fully utilized peak hospitalization passed. I'm sure control Cuomo driven feds, definitely avoidable error Cuomo least bears blame one given role. Already did! Opened yesterday. Yes, since wearing mask proactive rather reactive (YOU wearing mask protects ME), cant address personal risk effective way complete self quarantine.

This effective, honest, CONSISTENT messaging. Prime Minister Canada refuses travel meet US President, sent message citizens BOTH: Avoid unnecessary travel, stay home wear mask. (Of course know likely also excuse avoid spending time around Trump, OFFICIALLY message) meanwhile, President Mexico sent opposite best mixed message. TRUMP'S messaging likely encourage plane travel 'opening up? Possibly message important? Ignoring facts favor political position, maintaining plan avoid deaths? ask randoms internet? decide yourself... Restaurants won‚Äôt survive second lockdown What? come moon glows night? sun already down. Fake news 

/s ...I think actual article, yes? 

Summary plus additional points local:

* California still stay home order, stopped people coming Tahoe hotels casinos (in NV) open.
* We're seeing huge spike cases, shut surrounding parts counties NV CA sides much rural overall case rate still looks low
* Tourists coming hot spots everything shut down, like SF, LA, etc.
* result, super crowded Tahoe. beaches crowded, bars crowded, good compliance people regards wearing masks coming big groups friends families. 
* El Dorado County, includes one part South Shore Tahoe, seen fatalities yet, people using excuse safe here. even county health officer called lucky reminded people still know serious health effects people survive

Traveling rural tourist area small hospital 15 closest friends crowds country really good idea right now. Please don't. Funny told digging clearly worried bias conspiracy would. blinded need correct instead looking facts. Fact: whole lot people dying right now, ever, COVID no. Thousands deaths never see numbers deemed COVID related. way averages see. Real people dying, part fix it. Jesus, imagine feeling like shit (since else would tested) told sit line.

And people still think world class healthcare? really can't even begin understand people ""think"". well already let everyone get sick lmao. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* except stupidity. it‚Äôs going around days No, seems like HR issue. connect local HR discuss options. **Summary Recent Changes**

**Updated July 10, 2020:**

* Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR) added Table 1 new parameter value disease severity, replacing Symptomatic Case Fatality Ratio Symptomatic Case Hospitalization Ratio. IFR takes account symptomatic asymptomatic cases may therefore directly measurable parameter disease severity COVID-19.
* parameters healthcare usage Table 2 revised, updated estimates values based new data source: COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network new parameter healthcare usage added: percentage patients hospitalized COVID-19 die hospitalization.
* definition percent transmission occurring prior symptom onset (pre-symptomatic transmission) clarified update; parameter applies cases eventually become symptomatic. idea based information CDC Fauci said early on. People panicking ‚Äúthis infectious now, mutates kills people?!‚Äù 

The health experts pointed viruses mutate, tend become less deadly hosts, deadly, likely spread.

I think idea got clamped people believed ‚Äúone day would disappear like magic‚Äù, description would happen (even though scientists never actually said that). exponential growth looks like, troubling times either way. epicenter countries outbreaks whatever takes control spread federal government tells there‚Äôs nothing worry way equivalent months later wealth information making informed decision absolutely nothing control spread deadly virus. people died seatbelts cars don‚Äôt wear seat belt fault yours. Maybe he/she hasnt seen his/her parents long time wants meet them? Really difficult grasp... Community college online classes!!! get degree reasonable amount go CC state college get scholarships. 

Of course, don‚Äôt agree game system get good education . That‚Äôs complete defection point, made people still believe things like They‚Äôre gonna test population. I'm sorry that's situation. Stay well. EU countries get use excuse density, can‚Äôt hotspots like New York?

We don‚Äôt get excuse much larger populations them? love USA gets shit doesn‚Äôt get pass anything every country does. Biased much?

Sweden, lockdown country, approached zero new deaths. explain that? Clearly response wasn‚Äôt draconian.

Trump win year easily virus won‚Äôt detract that. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll blame Russians mail-in ballot ‚Äútampering‚Äù despite first place.

But right deflect actual blame China unleashed entire world, lied way, pressured side them, let flights leave country closing domestic ones (effectively exporting virus).

Herd immunity answer be. Watch explained away Nov 5th, virus magically longer talking point. I'm also posting articles news sources. feel like posts made MAGA random word generator. no, record, herd immunity better. also work whole punctuation deal.  Finally! kids won‚Äôt wear mask matter many times put them, that‚Äôs kids work best/worst part source COVID hospitalizations contradicts claim hospitalization numbers show 13 times likely hospitalized flu last year current COVID-19 hospitalizations.

There ""key points"" section one point hospitalization rates COVID-19 adults (18-64 years) time higher cumulative end-of-season hospitalization rates influenza past 5 influenza seasons. :} Exactly, we're peace Eastasia war Eurasia, we've always been! Would considered genocide? Rapid hospital building videos end Jan 5 year old likely smarter average person political party shall named sub. build man fire, he's warm day.

If set man fire, he's warm rest life. Cool. perhaps doctors love watch u suffer! Muahahahaha! Soon he‚Äôll saying he‚Äôs always worn mask... best masks. Trump supposed leader people. sheeple still believe B.S used anti mask wearing stance validation shouldnt.

He could help stop/slow COVID tracks wore masks example people. would point failures system (such UBI, medical care etc).  find ways cope, life same. I‚Äôm proud getting degree master‚Äôs continuing work. Now, work true danger! Sad... like someone glued acorn stomach They're already it. One female hosts talked recently got ton hate emails / tweets immediately segment aired. 

Also people assume fox ""infiltrated"" left recent reporting. Must nice privilege. work healthcare can't stay home I'm needed, I'm privileged financial means least keep family safe. Think many low income individuals situation risk health go homeless. Look, *might* safe effective vaccine developed short order, there's way I'd *bank* it. Cloth surgical masks become less effective time get wet soiled make sure factor calculations. fake! Photos doctored ya know!

-Some asswipe probably  Thanks encouragment! considering thing. I'm going look options. partner laid January thankfully got another job quickly unfortunately make much money new job. survived little pay past know make work..

You exactly right that's saying. countries opened schools somewhat successfully also taken aggressive measures face masks contact tracing United States done successfully. honestly earned right go back school face face. 

 results various vaccine trials least somewhat optimistic encouraging feel could hold little longer could really mitigate virus's damage.

Thanks again! Protesting regardless cause, like religious attendance person, luxury wait virus risk passed least manageable. yes critical lockdown protestors well BLM protestors. still, 99%+ 1% still survive.

Even extra conservative, 5% 1% population *maybe* dying something sound like something worthy shutting country over...more people die per year automobile crashes...why banned driving yet? base fucking sister hospital service coordinator tell people refusing wear masks upon entering hospital. people openly hostile needed escorted security. children. claiming Chinese government aware human-to-human transmission December, China told world. quarantine hospital construction January. ([This shows human-to-human transmission already started December.) mean pretty much every ride open. incentive go lower crowds/wait times, ignore ongoing global pandemic is. sentiment certainly mutual. Good luck pointless glove use. üëç news? Wow.... Sounds Bill de Blasio head local operations manager. Agreed. Imho America already missed boat. chance opened way way quick...some states even follow called strict guidelines open up.

America going suffer double hit economy short sightedness.. late. pushing subtle pro mask agenda week already. can't.

Maybe want to. Same. point job life?  every single teacher entire state strikes... going literally fire hire tens thousands new teachers? Camp Hansen.... Kinville desert activity awhile 

Probably good thing live China FAR form normal still. even close. know world talking about. know plenty good trailer folk despise fuck see point He's using playbook centrist Democrats. Namely, screw base, choice vote you.  man OP's graduate level book said it, must lying, Mr/Miss ""professional psychiatrist""

/s Watch stocks go 7% Monday Trump finally wore mask.

Imagine 100,000 lives saved Trump finally promoted wearing mask TV. hope one time thing. Seems like everything going mostly well. I'm still going grocery stores... Disneyland opening up... friends hosting bbq party soon. Seems like need keep repeat last 3 months 99%, keep curve flat trickle infections, we'll eventually get everyone immune it. 3 months * 99x 24 years. Nine casinos nothing laugh at. takes impeccable moron fail many casinos. Wjth lives line see doctors, military otherwise, putting foot down. whole premise National Debt fact owed countries money knew either could help us get money back declare war fuck don‚Äôt owe shit? 

It used to, currency backed precious metal. world currencies went full fiat, national debt became accounting artifact, intrinsic meaning anymore. get sound proof mask don‚Äôt need listen bullshit comes face hole? wonder caught hoax. Trump 5yo learning disability marching parents party saying ""look made poopoo potty"" refuses leave till every person party goes look it. Wow...thank service. That's tough career regular day üôè Bit late (understatement) hopefully effect ending insane culture war aspect wearing masks. Idk you‚Äôve ever Ohio finding someone wearing mask like finding you‚Äôre keys left door last night, people brag much don‚Äôt care coronavirus I‚Äôm telling complete nonsense Shhhhh Probably staff forced to. doesn‚Äôt matter far know don‚Äôt get go hospital without mask Congrats bare minimum fuck. corona, sucking Stone antibodies wear one set example. mean, would‚Äôve thought Trump would‚Äôve lost support every military member every person hardon Kaepernick ‚Äúdisrespecting flag‚Äù Trump pardoned convicted war criminal killed restrained, teenage, PoW stabbing fucking Bowie knife posed selfie body threatened squad mates reported incident... 

Or Trump, four time draft dodger called room full combat generals bunch babies fit go war with...

And yet are. don‚Äôt know single military member upset two incidents going vote Trump result 

Can republicans thread please explain Kaepernicks behavior disrespectful flag military two incidents described? 

Anyone? 

At point look mirror realize vote nothing flag white supremacy know one, primarily calls upon ignorance/administrative ignorance. believe name mentioned within ""Diagnostic"" course. cannot assume credibility study. worth scoping. also really dig anything up. sorry know book name mentioned, along notable figures power. Really, let pandemic get bad, bailout bailout hyperinflation, pay back national debt monopoly money. Hopefully lead end masks political people wear them. absolutely better late never situation. Wow, level miniaturization exists, tech telco companies rich! Strong Immortal Joe vibes went Walter Reed visit wounded Vets. man sold forces slaughtered Russian backed Taliban. allowed anywhere near wounded veterans. Huh. CDC updated current best estimates yesterday. 

Their new IFR considerably higher May 22 one. don't.  cause many thousands die.  Even Trump loses Biden take office end January take weeks longer develop implement effective pandemic response mention nothing done prepare deployment vaccine even one soon many months people able get it.

Trump go NOW. November. January. NOW.  Constitution offers us protection remedy GOP openly disregarding justified taking matters hands ending farce.

God help us gets re-elected.  death knell country know it. 750 Americans day dying this, 7x rate deaths car crashes 4x rate influenza good give reactionary feelings like this. easy. Good job! bestest test scores sure Careful now, reality tends political sub. ""You know call alternative medicine works? Medicine."" CoVID infection new Lazarus pit 4 months late Flu, years develop vaccine (they develop one every year every strain, know).

'Herd Immunity' necessarily mean people *get* virus... means *die* virus. achieve herd immunity COVID-19, disappear... kill people more. Like common cold. Everybody *somewhat* immune it... enough stop kills. tried everything reduce cases KY. GOOD. fucking care. people start wearing masks, people stop dying stop living home. picture looks like someone photoshopped masks everyone Gotta set one coke bottle-bucket traps. looks like kim yong un video  Exactly, Disney worry /s It‚Äôs actually common lot viral infections. people, it‚Äôs like switch turned immune systems. 14 caught stomach flu it‚Äôs never same. people survived polio post-polio syndrome, like CFS. Today looks like deadliest Saturday since May 3, globally. much I'd like rip wearing mask before, think need reinforce positive behavior good everyone. Thank finally wearing mask Pres. Shit's getting real. Still, things US insane. Lockdown protests, mask wearing protests, BLM protests riots, water parks open, crowded beaches, summer camps, church events... even friggin Disneyland opened! DeSantis going kill (more!) people! mechanism remove him? Holy shit, governors facing prison time level negligence.  ""Mr President, rumor dudes big dicks wear masks"" types injustice American police perpetuate lot insidious outright killings. Imagine somebody like ""Yeah office work environment really hostile, last week Kathy fucking *murdered* deskmate.""

Would make wonder awful environment even possible first place. Murder often grow chill, happy place.

While killings symbolically powerful easy see, economic, political, social systems supremacy American police enforce indirectly kill harm hundreds thousands Black people year.

This obvious even glance way Coronavirus disproportionally harming Black communities right now. Although cops pull trigger, enforced systems lead outcome. Sharing truth educate others good thing. truth scares that‚Äôs you. republicans love abandoning children soon they're born! Pro birth pro life That‚Äôs capitalism you. It‚Äôs like want beat total Communist death toll. Yeah mom got sick three months ago struggling brutal chronic fatigue ever since. deserve though? two-party electoral system like that? mean personally responsible system country really trying fix it. never thought would agree home schooling now. Nope, still looks like idiot. appalling idiot acting responsibly news.  opened last education system. Way grouped together, larger social circles etc. kind reminds Immortan Joe mask. want say something Americans like hear.

Maybe really taken seriously US reaches 1% population dying coronavirus infection Anddd australia we're opening yr 11 12 students far, situation stabilized France. See Left graph. 136 ¬´nouveaux patients hospitalis√©s¬ª = daily new admissions hospital ; 9 ¬´ nouveaux patients en r√©animation ¬ª = daily new patients admitted Intensive Care Unit. stays low now, finally exiting lockdown done correctly. good hope gonna stay low without second wave, testing place, manage track potential new clusters quaratine people goes hand. fucking bizzare. minority? wear damn mask . public ed sucks. look Betsy Devos. Never anything public education system. Born rich went private school. Sent kids private schools. charge public education system. joke. Yesterday Walmart two people stationed door actually turned guy away mask. said thanks that. walked saw people take masks got inside. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è species don‚Äôt deserve survive we‚Äôre gonna dumb. people young, fit, asymptomatic protesters infect? mean read titles Change tune David Bowie fucked child

Edit: mad still fucked child admitted it. store require masks people aren‚Äôt it? personal preference? cancelled way back March. exactly point shit-stirring? I'm sure make artist point took mask off. That's completely opposite guy replying said. 

He said ""all done tories done bit later "", saying ""her policies simply Uk govt policies week earlier"".

Can see opposite statements? Looks like knows son's gf got covid realizes next. thing predicted earlier post wich commented BBC story Instagram showed deaths certain month last year compared deaths month year, showed deaths accounted covid, indicating actually unfer-attributing deaths. 

So yeah, people stupid fuck didn‚Äôt ask Rona means ""cry"" Urdu fit well here. They're idiots. definitely new. 

Why wearing mask? sitting bench person talking facing , enough get infected person is. Even speaking throws lot infected particles . absolutely recommend wear mask close proximity people regardless indoors outdoors. He's bad interviewer though watch see guest rather Joe. completely agree entirely tragic, however, understand people finding difficult sympathize somebody publicly criticized BLM protesters, made rape jokes, posted islamophobic memes. Death rate high enough, waste medical resource maybe kill people along way continue learn nothing.  He's talking Hawaiin Falls Colony, brah. Yes ""steady rate"" exponential growth. derivative exponential function also exponential, cases per day deaths per day need growing exponentially well, clearly aren't.  pretty much stopped teaching science schools (at least elementary) focus math reading high stakes testing. Science gets minutes every days. showed important raised scientific thinkers. appreciate proactive listing studies every post still seems swarmed comments don‚Äôt work (or stuck loop said months ago).

Please everyone: Distance. Wear mask. Practice good hygiene. Don‚Äôt stupid. Don‚Äôt go parties bars even live somewhere incompetent leadership tells it‚Äôs okay. Don‚Äôt risk damaging health losing life political stance - SARs-Cov-2 give shit political leanings. that's ICU cases. There's many articles sub roughly 30% non=ICU cases sustained life long health complications discharge. live Maryland work large healthcare system. Heck even spent two days hospital couple weeks ago. safe. wear masks, screen patients. staying high risk situations death rate hospitalization rates trending down. Bigger that. Friend works blood cancer unit. Usually lots stem cell transplants, procedure keeps department afloat. None since March. 
They used partner medsurg weekends nights keep hours (this tough job complicated patients get know lot people die staffing challenging.)

Patients still sick, new diagnoses everyday, treatments limited staffing medsurg Covid now. 
And budgets hemorrhaging across hospital real money makers elective surgical procedures can‚Äôt, good conscience, risk. evidence shows transmitted droplets various sizes. far discussion also airborne, proven moment. similar diseases also transmitted droplets, would incredibly strange situation turned airborne.

I've seen experts discuss small droplets hang around air small enclosed spaces. **""...you able take seriously discussion someone confronting taboid defending prefer keep using jokes sarcastical tone instead rebuting arguments sources...""**

If dont agree defending okdiario. impossible serious. versus me.

Maybe wait goverment paid media investigate fake news well. would take reporter even half day check true not.

But oh wait true wouldnt fit ""we safe tourism paradise propaganda."" better call fake news keep going.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S: countless solid sources (i.e. INE) claiming covid death toll close okdiario MANY MEDIA says prolly mean ""sources"" goverment sources left wing sources.

Sadly sources really busy getting ready make president heroe saved us certain death. new narrative incoming. \^\^ Presuming masks reduce transmissions similar (or acceptable) degree preferred solution pick one. still usual stuff businesses suffer less. minor inconvenience. course combination two would mostly affective can't really long term. looks like virus gonna go away fully good while. change people's minds talk side rather preaching choir. absolutely better mask wearing pushed public, enclosed busy places. Even worn incorrectly. normalises practice majority wear mask correctly positively impact situation.

Perhaps instead dismissing people wearing masks incorrectly, advocate better education effectively wear masks? 17,818 pediatric cases Florida July 11th. yea, sure, let's reopen schools. politicians care kids they're embryos. kids  Americans start take Corona virus seriously started wear mask. good people Belgium smart enough understand ""wear mask. nose"", actually it.

In America that. millions fucking idiots. 

It really fucking pathetic. thread pulled well considered low quality content.

To fair entire thread believe masks; believes ghosts. *Car keeps crashing downhill towards cliff*

There's 'no justification move forward'  also brain damage disease. We're impacted nation generations. fucked. U.S third world country still developing compared countries,

No not. want compare to? Response covid? sucks. agree. GDP? Economic health? know like bond together bash crap states far third world country. It‚Äôs area can‚Äôt avoid social distancing. would need wear mask park?

Not new all, sure you‚Äôd use sarcasm make jokes coronavirus. course success; well ... Team Virus.

Landslide victory! also think read service trains converted makeshift wards India. would fit well choice wording.  That‚Äôs assuming people get vaccine. live age facebook, don‚Äôt forget. people childish wearing mask store, imagine said store restaurant puts sign saying need show documentation vaccination entering, God, hope makes supporters wear too, damn. personally believe Boris Johnson's infection coronavirus one point going ICU critical condition objectively saved lives many British people

At time personally think even Trump goes Boris Johnson went through, there's good chance change he's Yup children organ damage going grow healthy strong adults. People getting brain damaged disease. We're setting society potentially generation worth damage what? Brooklyn (where he‚Äôs from). three üëç  good boy!! Someone give candy managing colossal task! problem us cares much econemy saving 

But economy can't thrive people sick. makes sense open instead nice old man, death greets door favorite restaurant.  him, society? death tallied marked trump death Sounds like could going atrial fibrillation flutter. he's going back beta blocker means he's rapid ventricular response atrial arrhythmia. might able ablation burn problematic electrical circuit muscle. EF 15% he's gonna need little help though. Trump, first time life, something selfless.

Now news. know they're mandated everywhere. reason ignorance. mandated. must new sub, sarcasm used heavily criticize government policy. seriously underestimate stupidity media leading gullible public large believe false information. No, lot white Americans expressed hatred leadership, conservatives see leadership fine

You're making non-race issue race issue way man virus totally can‚Äôt infect homemade shitty masks also don‚Äôt social distance virtuous reasons virus knows stay away That‚Äôs he‚Äôs wearing black mask. took months realize worries could solved black mask. dare you, number least slightly body temperature (Celsius, course)! keep killing people.... ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs happens politics get involved medical decisions,‚Äù Dr. Radovanovic said.

This pandemic summarized one sentence. I'm concerned could infected. That's issue. 

Its hate vitriol family getting. That's beyond unnecessary, absolutely cruel. 

Let deal grief privacy. love wearing mask asthma. Walter Reed likely let without someone spine. Sorry, border closed. official [trump 2020 website want mask says ""Jesus savior &amp; Trump President"" 
 
I don't, people might. prevent daycare clusters. open schools. *Jumps cliff get breeze fresh air around nose, wonders half way might bad idea reaches destination* - people ... mitigate bit restricting tourist based businesses. concerning considering vast, varied serious symptoms suffer ME/CFS mention limited understanding pathophysiology, lack treatments lack sympathy condition general   know viruses cause cancer road. know viruses go dormant never really go away causes life long problems. 

This right here. already plenty stories people issues well supposedly recovered. God knows people permanently disabled. Better safe sorry I'd hate see child's life shortened young person permanently disabled damned disease. deaths per day cases per day going steady rate - 

On Sunday tend go due reporting. like.... covid's point view? Thanks clarification, feeling bad.  People stop voting LUL sick types headlines. ‚Äúsome outraged‚Äù focus article? It‚Äôs news source. focus Alameda‚Äôs policies. 

Then, want piece reactions it? Well there‚Äôs ‚Äúsome‚Äù outrage means there‚Äôs reactions outrage. give voice outraged others? Oh that‚Äôs right, bleeds leads. part problem everyone other‚Äôs throats.

Edit: make clear, problem headline content article. content article actually stated policy reactions are. spoiler‚Äîno one actually said outraged- that‚Äôs bit editorializing headline. Responses were, it‚Äôs hard deal business owner, roll well organized, we‚Äôre concerned employees jobs, one town says they‚Äôre going follow it. technically, 1%-10% population infected. Quite insane. probably tested positive way show masks don‚Äôt work. Maybe someone told starting point 71K means exponential curve? 

Or maybe butt-buddies southern states phoned shit hit fan hospitals full?! Good kiddo #OOF No. replying half comment. Yes that‚Äôs situation we‚Äôve stupid people stupid.

I stunned It‚Äôs votes Mr Trump Media hype. Probably something similar flu. county goes hard! honestly I‚Äôm convinced wasn‚Äôt money laundering.

Isn't already implied talking casinos? anything trump matter. Maybe they‚Äôre also tired seeing idiot fan base copping charges losing jobs video see. 

They know currently losing tens thousands voters pandemic. Felonies lose voting abilities too, death. 

And R congress others R power must quite aware bad base looking last long weeks. Trump may aware, rest guys aren‚Äôt idiots. ‚ÄúDid someone say Russian bounties?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, look, Trump commuted Roger Stone!‚Äù ‚ÄúWTF, Stone sentence commuted?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, look!

Honestly, long wearing one properly, care politics. ‚ÄúNow masks bad, watch‚Äù

Lunacy. applaud thank you. ones Presidential Seal them. ugh. may also thought could still contain testing contacting tracing. Probably didn‚Äôt realize we‚Äôd fail badly. 

But wish would recommended fabric masks. already fabric mask announcement made pretty upset time. came around though that‚Äôs good. like every day hope certain person come around beg everyone wear masks. looks like plasma dose (from picture ) .5 cc .2 cc. different would expect - 10 20 50 cc. 

But, course, can't get legal, never able optimize dose problem democracies. discipline among less intelligent citizenry. won‚Äôt they‚Äôre told unless threat bullet. much like children. wish America unleashed military proper quarantine scenario back March. wasn‚Äôt aware going allow American citizens fend half country voted trump proved anti science. people never comply reason logic. must applied force. longer funny. Fucking finally!! followers need see regularly knOw KiDs cOntRaCT vIruS. No. celebrate birthdays he's 1 years old therefore risk. six 9/11s off. chance it‚Äôs rigged....please vote! didn‚Äôt offer one potential strategy.

He literally [already done ‚ÄúWhat mask?‚Äù

 Bolsonaro diagnosed hasn‚Äôt made bit difference *him*. There's difference wearing masks actively creating propaganda encourage people wear masks, think? Well...

But people sub dont like information contradicts believe, making eerily similar mask Yeah wear mask whole pandemic response big brother written it. King Bankruptcies isn‚Äôt easy attain;

Much less maintain! Get ready little whizzpopping! great acknowledge health crisis survive. deciding factor proves counting deaths improper way guage severity illness. Deaths simply become statistical percentage overall population referred ""a drop bucket"" survivors people. Living witnesses. test him, would fine park. Fucking foreigners. requires effort discuss things like adult. doubt man. Less people around spend money isn‚Äôt good potentially evil rich people. Try resist thoughts. gross incompetence schools caving various pressures (govt, parents, funding) almost guys want super dangerous virus. math.

Yes, outdoors preferable indoors.

Yes, likely (although universally agreed) non-medical facial coverings *reduce* transmission.

But **no** gathering safe. virus care social distancing, thrilled don't.

One reason public health officials wary recommending facial coverings encourage overconfidence sloppy, risky behavior. see looks like, body counts match. Anyone else tired winning? know commentors laughing right? ThTs Camacho Mojtain Dew said. it! Beat shit. best you. something... back real world lol Trump highest military authority guy. Brass can‚Äôt tell wear mask. can‚Äôt even argue him. Chain command strictly enforced military especially top brass. 

It‚Äôd nuts act authority him.

That‚Äôs see retired military guys coming him. Anyone still serving cannot, law. Sadly sub politics real science. Whomever fuck talked it... believe evidence trending toward conclusion airborne transmission ‚Äúthe primary possibly important mode transmission SARS-CoV-2.‚Äù

Already seeing Texas Abbott. Granted near cult leader status trump, it'd interesting. 

Also Annoying Orange perfect name him. eyes lips. would think would learned last tragedy. Yes, have! Plus, I'm also microbiologist. :) Ahh Chile way count ""recovered"" corona. Could something know about, like country hitting 70k cases one day...  may never recover reading comment. push ups squats inherently using muscle push weight....

If push body weight, bench press weights it....i dont understand whats hard grasp concept Basically entire US economy revolves around debt lol. I‚Äôm pretty sure would first time 300+ years would debt free? Wasn‚Äôt whole premise National Debt fact owed countries money knew either could help us get money back declare war fuck don‚Äôt owe shit?  Made in..... China People giving baby much credit ... ohhh look wearing mask finally ohhh great know next couple weeks bad. late move? gods sake read whole thread. 

It regrettable lied. understand end hurt helped. simply saying that.

Lying sows doubt. 

You aren‚Äôt helping refusing acknowledge mistakes. giving fuel idiots. Downvote want. sympathy here. Anti-maskers need learn lessons. wear one public month ago Democrats gave shit it. make fun him, still wearing one.

No, that's incorrect. [He photographed briefly backstage wearing said took want [""give press pleasure seeing make fun he's collossally irresponsible trying lead example three months ago. massive spike cases here, deaths soon follow, commendable he's regrettable took many deaths much time. Here's another fun revelation lot you. Trump actually care tax returns, leaked MSNBC years ago turned nothing noteworthy. keeps making big deal concealing distracts passes legislation. gainfully employed, decent citizen. health insurance.

Or indigent bum. ER treats gratis, passes along costs society large.

It's lazy, no-skill, 35-and-still-working-minimum-wage slackers worry. could probably improve lot... don't. Mostly complain online, fantasize living European country likely would never allow enter. discriminate, though. One side likely socially distance wear mask. beginning, hit NY hard asymptomatic period knowing enough, mixed info masks, etc. cases low tri state area live, states saw could happen nothing protect themselves. would bring increase us military personnel matter weighing whether open schools. additional knowledge gained virus officials believe worth risk comparing make children attend school home. benefits outweigh risks. smart act new information virus learned important wear masks initially it. New data, change behavior based data. That's problem death cults, kill members, others. Reference Aum Shinrikyo Sarin gas attacks. Covid Rump bit subtle, much,, much effective death decisiveness. even illogical Alex Jones hope so. failed come plan failed lower infection rate. people running show one shot get right called hoax claimed harmless. havent earn right open schools. force even worse, economically health wise. raping trafficked women, right? heard sound bite Trump saying he's always thought people use masks they're useful. Bull fucking shit. Flip flopping mafucka. I'd love hear worshippers say response Nevada It‚Äôs okay, part one big happy family. distancing required! /s measures ""excess deaths,"" although higher number deaths attributed directly coronavirus, last saw suggested actual number coronavirus deaths much 30% higher number reported. IFR is, say, .5%, increasing 30% give .7% IFR. that's factoring IFR determined based number cases reported, actually significantly less actual number cases (difficult predict, obviously).

Either way, media would interpret kind data either catastrophic (MSNBC) ignore altogether pretend lie (Fox News). neither. statistic will. problem one really feel data, left devices without real leadership, we're going continue living clusterfuck.  Hey I‚Äôm double glad here, wore mask thanked guy actually pretty shitty  haven‚Äôt heard China January February,  think America handle Coronavirus much better China, even top medical experts said US better CDC charge February. 

Chinese CDC founded help CDC, naturally look it.

The rest history.  Speaks volumes protestors. raw doggin rona! apologies. trying smartass drag anyone‚Äôs bad memories. SHOW MONEY, Jerry!  Thank Mr. President bare minimum risk resembling leader. Ridiculous. even get test? either better, sick infected dozen people. Iowa - test took 30 hours. name band?

However, tests frozen shrimp inner packaging negative. may increase benefits paid $600 history.  fact manipulation seems best way get leader president united states sad.

What shithole country It‚Äôs infuriating people act like this. understand voters side whichever party aligns personal beliefs views doesn‚Äôt inherently mean opposing party ‚Äúevil‚Äù deemed enemy. mask recommendation smart move, backed science, makes grueling trip market groceries safer all. play guitar could learn play Bon Jovi I‚Äôm interested Wake daily death counts start rise proportion daily case counts. Case totals walking away death count four weeks now, CDC says median time symptom onset death around two standard deviation 8. 

Death counts rising now, they've barely budged. Good Weak! Weak leader! Well satisfying.  going end well. Finally!! happened Station, can't believe they'd something like this. Unfreakingbelievable! I'm hoping shutdown Ohio, least counties like Franklin. officially control. never good businessman... would anyone expect now? red. testing, real numbers, people going outside, gathering (right neighbor party). one calls bodyweight workouts ""lifting weights"" took 70k one day üòî That‚Äôs actually did. literally thanksgiving, went cruise thanksgiving week stopped Orlando week, went Disney world day this? /r/joerogan ? even see police wearing face masks protesters pointing out... although wearing also. needed masks March? Frontline workers hypochondriac Karen‚Äôs? Truly curious, handling pandemic affected support Republican party? think Clinton administration would handled better? probably get removed automod want brief conversation message directly I'm u/tomjonesdrones even know transmission contact surfaces primary vector months later.  guidance effectively reduce rate transmission almost rate flu one wants fucking listen experts are. People crowding A/C spaces dumb F. However quote Game Thrones ""Winter Coming"". Low humidity Winter cause spikes cold regions. like Brazil dealing with. good bro. Nerves raw right US. see every day. Yeah, one thing group complaining people work, business shuttered.


It's another thing Karen Bubba ignoring requests act safely, social distance, wear masks, yell restaurant, retail, grocery workers rights trampled discriminated asked follow safety measures. places getting chernobyl levels readings, ridiculous numbers like 30% tests coming back positive. Someone stood said wear damn mask want come building funny thing black brown communities hit first hardest infect everyone else. affluent white people going immune getting sick long virus rages. belief - poor/working class black brown people virus - keep governors/mayors takes get virus control. Fuck country Possible gave false negative. Yeah, I'm sure classifying active cases. could well cases recorded outcome, asymptomatic mild cases followed outcome. said cases hospitalization lasts weeks months, people continue test positive long seem well, cases people negative still lingering effects, so.... ? finally sway almighty non-sheep people?  Thank you! kindness means lot : ) ""oh no, deep state got too!"" guns?  thick accent equate broken English. 

Also, school experience, mean others. Look happened toilet paper. absolutely trust truth, nurses doctors still ppe discriminate, really likes flavor old people. He's probably hiding N95 underneath Yup providing back friend üòú likely Walter Reed told either wear mask allowed come in. specifically lie about? Hes pretty much person admin honest, even mistaken times. saying COVID unfair different countries? Ok... debate whether COVID aerosol transfer like flu measles droplet. de-emphasis transfer surface admission aerosol. criminal politicians want risk people's lives ""numbers"" look worse. 

Vote out. Looks better can't see ugly ass veneers. think stupid people wait see president wears mask deciding wear one.

And they're ones call others sheep. Real fkn stupid. Probably already 138,000 time, thoughts feelings matter. Knowing kind strangers wishing well family means lot. Thank you. sane country newsworthy. gets people wear masks, sounds good You‚Äôre absolutely right, originally making joke Trump seem book smart sort went track there. I‚Äôve actually heard Goldwater rule before, I‚Äôve also heard professionals field (not sure psychologists psychiatrists) felt rule shouldn‚Äôt place anymore. know conditions requirement actually causing harm way (for example random guy saying he‚Äôs addicted sex likes lot isn‚Äôt example addiction) makes lot sense. figured that's ""defunding antifa universities"" maybe both. death rate 0.26%, per CDC... fear-monger. got pregnant February Covid blew region. Im 38 really time wise. never!

 felt OK especially Maryland governor Hogan top things forcing us teachers go back feel horrible. force pregnant teachers go back lot money? get paid enough risk lives. Going need bigger mask contain bullshit. gains, bro  Many Americans realize ALOT people time anti semites. Hell, even Canada sent back boatload Jews back Germany want them. fact host Fear Factor show huge following indictment average intelligence citizens USA lol Actually Roger Stone thankfully still one main topics. Hope doesn‚Äôt get buried shitshow stunt.  states cps shit regardless. Unless parents putting kids life immediate (like waiving knife them) danger. always case, completely incapacitated drugs.

Source: extended family. measure whatever metric makes us look best among peers. Here's tiny trophy Sweden. things careful, avoid indoor spaces, wearing masks, washing hands. dumb fucks think safe go back things ruining it. don‚Äôt remember that. must already hit point tuned federal government religiously refreshing state‚Äôs unemployment page.  Eminem effect imo. confirmed positive today. I've believed since beginning immaculate hygiene mask practices. anything, I'm angry asshole ruined odds passed along, crushing efforts. week since noticed symptoms they've mild thankfully, hit fever experience breathing issues. I'm living constant fear paranoia... know whats symptom anxiety. feel scared, mad everyone taking seriously... fml native Oklahoman, Thunder Fan wanted go year. probably next year maybe even later, whole situation got better. shit, tell us wear since begining developed bests masks us wear. reason one IRS auditing taxes. could release returns, face visable times... source 100% trusted, one agree degrees trustfulness. Could say Fox News trustworthy Washington Post? outlets would inclined believe information? Question: state requires everyone wear mask/face covering public. Would socially acceptable buy wear face shield instead mask? trigeminal neuralgia extreme face nerve pain masks painful (I still wear 100% time public) Grandma's problem primarily. Trump complicit, knows Grandma would wear one wore one, come earlier saying masks sign weakness.



Anti-maskers ones political medical crisis. didn‚Äôt family shit would made already many 776 injuries resulted deaths? Disneyworld: spread joy. Can‚Äôt help themselves? thought lone star state tough. That‚Äôs 580 wholesome American families ripped apart assholes won‚Äôt wear masks.

That‚Äôs 580 people likely already deployed last 18 months medicine still keeping nearly OIF/OEF hospitals need inplace guys get hurt matter few.

That‚Äôs 580 people stripped local communities medical needs. That‚Äôs right, every single one doctors, nurses, technicians working military treatment facility civilian hospital prior deployed, bunch somewheres America short staffed midst pandemic y‚Äôall want act like it‚Äôs 2019.

Fuck anti-maskers denying serious problem. *We, People* organized *own* weekly event Dr Fauci?

Found Bob Chapek‚Äôs reddit account.. Yes, even Juntas Electorales rule law here, decisions regarding autonomic elections challenged High Court Trump‚Äôs wearing mask, means pro-mask beginning. UK certainly terrible job it, albeit much better US. acted decisively, stringently, quickly. Leadership remains weak. different stage pandemic, likely get less restrictive measures right now.

That's poorly US done, one worst reactions world still miles better. Remember like 3 months ago US government bunch dumbass plane flyovers thank Healthcare workers? Feels like century ago lol find hilarious! Canada 10 million people Australia - 10,000 cases 108 deaths, compared Canada's 107, 347 cases 8,773 deaths. Well done Canada! üëé wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbad‚Äù enough months ago. must ‚Äúreally bad‚Äù even wear mask. Remember guy want wear mask beginning. NRA people buying guns now. plenty already, prices roof availability spotty. wave primarily driven people think would ever need gun before. See ""Exaggerated risk transmission COVID-19 fomites"" /r/COVID19/comments/hltayx/exaggerated_risk_of_transmission_of_covid19_by/ basically said need someone cough surface someone else touch soon surface transfer infectious dose. opinion piece, backed evidence review article: ""There clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature. "" go describe possible cases, nothing surface definitely culprit. Granted, surface lead transmittion really hard track, reasonably common seen least one confirmed case now. also couple hospital researches swabbed surface around positive patients, found viral material, failed grow viable virus lab. portion population currently affected likely different earlier. 

I keep hearing this, I've seen evidence true, way really make much sense. busiest, mobile people friends one likely pick pass circulating contagions, would expect they're ones would first affected. 

Old, susceptible people would like canaries coalmine. virus circulating time killing first sick, housebound old person means likely already affecting younger crowd. 

You hear 80 year old super spreaders, they're mobile social enough become one. doubling time 3.5 days, week makes four times many infections. Two weeks make sixteen times many infections. countries' epidemics week ahead.

Therefore headline read: 

At lock-down, Sweden merely tenth infections. Nine ten fatalities entirely avoidable, chose to. infection hotspots emerged Britain‚Äôs Midlands, Germany‚Äôs west throughout America

Well, hotspots seen relation numbers. Yes, Germany new hotspot (singlular) north west. still, Germany's total number new infected per day 3-500 cases day. many states US claim low numbers? add Germany forth population US. So, yes, Germany new hotspot, yes lock area, comparing US Germany like comparing raging forest fire candle lamp. Safety concerns aside...It baffles people willing pay full price half experience Dallas County, 60% infected Latinos, though group comprises 41% population.

[Coronavirus cases skyrocketing among communities outbreak worsens throughout South West, caseloads growing fastest counties large communities color. clearly clue vaccine development works. whole point thousands individual trials exactly find severity frequency side effects. risk side effects lower risk posed actual disease vaccine pass test. mean think they‚Äôre multi-billion dollar safety studies shit giggles?

I‚Äôm sorry sibling, personally affected (statistically rare, always possible) case make authority risks posed vaccinations. quantitative risk assessment done scientists much comprehensive field except maybe nuclear technology, find risk vaccine preferable covid, done homework. Accidents happen even low risk events occur.  UK instituted lockdown March 23. see graph, took couple weeks action took effect. US ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù half hearted, disjointed, states ignored. 

If country comparisons actually show evidence title, I‚Äôd love see them. Imagine happens ignore public health advice can't say ""they knew"" such.


Also, reaction often ""when learn?"" can't ""learn"" such: fed lies every day.


The solution education (I mean, real education, including critical thinking) long term.


I keep thinking we're fucked short term... welcome.

Westminster closed Scottish border 1950 look rock, don‚Äôt see Holyrood can‚Äôt close control pandemic. Hopefully causes U.S. reformed healthcare system.

I hope. African Americans twice likely get virus white Americans, 62 cases per 10,000 people, [according new New York Times federal government data. Hispanic Americans three times likely infected whites. groups dying COVID-19 nearly twice rate white people. still doubting #1 basic thing stop transmission virus? 

Are really dumb? trialling Australia months. even mean? ‚Äúproperly maintained‚Äù mean? people additional pre-existing conditions (such old age) get sick people wear masks? Lots people additional conditions fault own. Additionally, it‚Äôs difficult predict get severely sick vs. won‚Äôt. Plenty perfectly healthy people getting severe cases, even aren‚Äôt hospitalized.

Civil liberties? Died. China won. *certain people parts America. It‚Äôs big place. Fwiw probably fine. Things might suck week. think America inevitable matter good hygiene due sheer amount rona circulation now.

Stay strong good luck. hate this. reaction.  wording seems weird. Twice likely catch it? twice likely it? appears meaningful know about, contrasts attribute part findings increased chance exposure. Many people color front-line jobs, use public transportation live multigenerational homes. What's +/- 17,000 deaths friends? /s chart covid-19 deaths. 

To honest headlines subreddit quite dishonest. Yes. said people ""Slooow testing DOWWWNNNNNNN""

To play devils advocate sympathy, high amount tests go would hard keep demand getting done quickly. hope lolly gagging it. Getting results back #1 priority... sad problem brexit solve least part  fine dandy. don‚Äôt disagree. HOWEVER something families.  Daycare fucking expensive. I‚Äôm spending bauble usually getting schooling.  time get home it‚Äôs late there‚Äôs feasible way home school. 


A friend mine risk losing job income soon daycare costs weekly income.


Something done. remarkable empirically proven think citizen compliance key phrase here. never understand many Americans batshit crazy want keep families healthy. Good luck masks. immunity. Creeping death. tell others yes racism health care, maybe fitting headline case? made sub discuss questions like yours. Feel free join interest you: There‚Äôs couple different ways test it. There‚Äôs blood test test couple different genes associated celiac. way endoscopy, small biopsy duodenum check cilia. someone celiac, cilia flattened specific way. second way, need eat gluten least 3 months test cilia change seen someone‚Äôs reacting gluten. Thanks statistics, evidence one Canada going indoor space absolutely necessary. Pray alternate hard U.S.A get control like everyone else has? care all? dont care mask. dont care compulsory use choose go anywhere enforcing it.

I also think people taught use efficiently.

Im struggling issue? moon protect himself, protect . need compassion. example people deserve it. estimated R\_t already fallen high 2.5 start march 1.13 March 23. reason belive lockdown meaningfully contributed decrease except confirmation bias.

Death cruel sense humor. doctor would refuse. I'm helping people somebody dives pool fuel decides cool smoke cigar go fuck DeSantis 1,500 medical personnel deployed FL. Like Norway, instance. honest way put would institute lockdown restrictions way late (like UK did, herd immunity), might end similarly awful death figures Sweden. believe main reason difference deaths Sweden Nordic countries terrible Swedish management elderly care houses, deaths happened. basically difference Swedish strategy Norwegian strategy deciding close schools.

Correct I'm wrong. Thanks lot! Put theory practice. Sounds like great idea...  someone threaten one underage baristas coffee shop work at. Nearly call police them, left huff. said was, required law ask wear mask entering sir. Dude went made cry. Like pathetic make 16 year old girl cry? people standing outside roadhouse-kicking anyone argues. fuck argues medics hospital? around world?

Spain would like chat. someone Europe, we‚Äôre allowed travel again, told keep tabs hotspots avoid these, dine, sit outside, basically everything go clubs, mindful keeping distance. economy isn‚Äôt better right yours, 100% cooking books. 32% American households unable make rent/mortgage month June. Bars still closed friends CDMX sending pics restaurants sell alcohol. since end March one wearing mask. least lot restaurants good ventilation outdoor seating worry since opened indoor eating recently things get worse. know cities asked anyone.

But yeah left felt like ramping bad times. even doctors wearing masks.  sentiment has, care uneducated teaching wear mask properly. title article super misleading. two issues exactly related.

Minority outcomes worse many diseases. Got it.

Minorities twice likely catch corona, almost twice likely die it.

That means better outcome catching corona, larger proportion infected.

I reread thing three times, no, ""twice likely die infected"". proportion population. look Thats saddest part...

I recall 1st campaign didnt like electoral system OCD? mean something respiratory related like COPD? Nah, way American people would ever vote first sort thing r/covid19positive seems like good place talk people similar situation. Best luck. Vic addressing all! ""Wear face masks CAN?"" got mess infect whole country can. Constant flow VIC number plates Hume Highway right now. Assuming deal heat, sort face shield scarf hybrid helmet thing would achieve result. said don‚Äôt think authority would care even wore face covering whole extreme nerve pain face thing.

Those Houston Dallas hospitals doctors working double shifts. That‚Äôs sustainable. Well didn‚Äôt someone tell before!  Never said agenda,

Death cult gunna cult Lock NY down! Keep people out! havent back tracked all. Exactly way Trump wants it. lol wore orange even noticed him.  Texas separate military loyal Texas? dont use them? know suspect science taught primary school taught poorly.

It surprising say least way people acting wearing mask. 

Also, America never invaded least 100 years generally speaking life gotten better 200 years. many strving death, roof head tv ,phone internet, adversity general, horrors polio long forgotten,

I think people use major problems grasp BIG problem. % people get ‚Äòbrain fog‚Äô? 

Not many. sure include China scathing obituary. much blame states Governor. see flaw argument here... utterly ridiculous comparison.

Sweden big wave testing available. argument really dishonest. think hope country upcoming term Biden picks great VP immediately replace senile old fuck. walking category 5 hurricane..... know situation live. feel safe enough go gym go, scared dont go. Simple that, really dont see random information happening 7000 kilometers away changes anything. Plus sub really best ask comes reliable information seeing either full doomers full conspiracy theorists commentating Nope, mistake. us favor. Many athletes healthy may believe. bodies often times distorted due rigors stress put bodies through. many young often times go unnoticed. may healthy medical standpoint, fail recognize distortions healthy body day day basis. distortions go unchecked untreated health tends decline one becomes vulnerable.

I predict family get severely sick maintained properly, distortions accounted corrected. perfectly healthy people speak perfectly healthy. merely appeared according modern medical standards.

Notice research done get sick all? money it! confident know get sick keeping family great health great many sicknesses passed throughout years. Even many around come something nasty lasts many months recover from, fine. explain it, Daylight Saving Time started 29th March Sweden really fucked elderly care houses many old people died. management absolutely horrible, shows data. 

Except Swedish strategy wrong and, except closing schools, basically Norway Finland. understand much hate it. 

We need live virus while, closing society 2-3 years realistic option. People start realise now. 1% wanted kill off. thanks never North Dakota dying Great White concert wouldnt make sense you. work hospital. don‚Äôt think lying this. also wonder didn‚Äôt wear pull-ups today put big boy pants? skip afternoon nap? sound like bit much one day! guess praise least wearing mask, maybe one day soon potty trained too. 

He leader free world, say, wearing god damn mask beginning pandemic. Instead encouraged thousands boneheads complain wear masks. time worry car talking credit officer bank, mechanic... US 36,000 traffic fatalities per year. average age death car crash? 38. Sound right? According actuary tables, average motor vehicle mortality steals 39.7 years life. So, 36,000 per year x 39.7 years 1,429,200 years life taken per year US motor vehicle accidents. 

Now, average covid-19 death? average age someone dying covid-19 78-81. Let‚Äôs use 79. Actuary tables show average 79 year old 8.4 years life left, covid-19 disproportionately affects already sick, ones dying covid-19 likely lower end figures cohort. odds dying covid-19 given age roughly par odds dying cause within one year age, likely average covid-19 victim year left lifespan, let‚Äôs generous say 4.2 years left average. puts years lost far due Covid US 570,650. 

Time tell future holds, even got it, time would take happen, still wouldn‚Äôt likely take much life motor vehicle accidents. People like hearing truth. started locking kids cages. 

There's another poster posted link stupid argument. said I‚Äôd rather associated either cult-like political party, previous replies convey that

Yeah, two previous posts might say post history contradicts them. US apparently lot days rest world. needs reported asap. Please don‚Äôt spread message young people fine COVID, that‚Äôs wha causing mess first place. There's major problem mindset, though (one apparently anti-maskers seem forget/refuse realize well) fact mindset take account deaths *other people* anti-maskers causing.  
This mask/no mask thing politicized lot countries boils whether person compassion concern *lives others*, own.  
And many people still trying get anti-maskers start wearing masks properly; care lives others own. mean point might well wear proper one ‚Äú still compassionate whether agree someone‚Äôs beliefs not. Someone passed away compassion towards that.‚Äù 

I agree compassion thing, hate wearing mask considered ‚Äúsomeone‚Äùs beliefs‚Äù. Wearing mask distancing isn‚Äôt open interpretation. intake got halved owing pressure quarantine setup - Human Nature announced quitting Las Vegas coming home. guess afford $3,000 quarantine?  fucking terrorism. virus new, literally know, know yet. Think viruses lay dormant human body flare years later, like chicken pox. around long enough know there's flare months years road. Also, stats based background checks.. states, including Texas, background check license carry. 

 dropped gun store yesterday waiting car get fixed next door. completely sold out. Tbf wear masks Disney world. yeah point stands. Wear mask go jail, either way risk lower rest population.  might actually get revolution overthrow empire happens. lol, know right? Hopefully lead Jade Helm-esque paranoia. meant OCD.  ...failed nation state status achieved. Trump's 'Merica. maybe countries 10 times, USA seems test looot dog fight, trying fool excluding whole bunch countries (large, relevant ones) chart? wear mask Well, working memory factor affecting IQ.

""When hang swamp, gonna get mosquito bites"" 
...?? work conservative area. confirm, there‚Äôs plenty masks Yeah I've heard back good list again. hope political stigma around worn off. hope drug amazingly effective. problem numbers correct. ok... US reduction smart people babies stupid people keep going. evening things out. think article correct first time worn mask willingly photographed press pool. Even Fox News reporting way. I‚Äôm yellow belt Google Fu could mistaken, couldn‚Äôt find photos wearing one previously.

Edit: mistaken. wear one Ford factory Ypsilanti, best keep press photographing wearing mask. link anyone else wondering this. 

Added word willingly Yeah great also double work terms maintaining primary home here... money able pay someone else it! r/maliciousCompliance knock knock ding dong... ignore reality, can't ignore consequences reality. someone wearing mask like finding you‚Äôre keys left door last night

I think meant heck expression mean.

If ever find keys door last night, first thought ""wow, could dangerous"" ""I wasted time tearing house looking them"". Sweden also much greater spread measures taken anywhere Scandinavia (the week March 11/12). New figures FHM estimate R0 upward 7 February. hard lockdown would effect, relatively large death figure (especially compared Scandinavian countries) already locked second week March. Last year crisis teaching, coming year would different expectations actually set. make sure kids access technology fail kids work. case last year. us actually allowed count anything grade less 20 % students participating. expect distance learning fall anything like distance learning lockdown. No, that's true - weed kill. that's interesting point - interesting point actually want change people's behavior - want punish people consider inferior. one WDW ""escapists."" state Annual Passholders vacation Disney World 3x year. absolutely love important me.

I ""die mouse"". part ""experiment."" trips cancelled March 2021 cancel one too, needed.

Yes, people still going go WDW, despite risk. But, someone lives WDW message boards lived breathed Disney facts, rumors, trends past 5 years, Disney fans going parks right now. 

Even reduced capacity (rumored 20%), hitting threshold. Hotel prices slashed availability abundant, even among DVC (timeshare) resorts. 

I say hope humanity left. able rely fellow humans (not government, mind you) get pandemic, believe people right thing staying home. case, think (not all, most) traveling WDW, remain hopeful.

tl;dr - ""cult"" fans going WDW, not. looks weak now, evidence says increased infection minority communities nothing protests. guess always easy look good compare worst. happens Sweden compared [It took figure wear Absolutely!  That‚Äôs claim, yes. Jesus! frickin‚Äô hard? experiment shit like fucking vaults expirements Fallout games lmao

Good luck everyone evidence? 60 times production! ever want see magic trick area? Stand place one, slowly reach mask like going take off. Instant old person right bubble. anti Sweden propaganda users sub absolutely ridiculous, also pretty bad. factors play severity lockdowns, Swedes distancing quite well. competition, certainly try use try tell people locking bad Take Lipo vitamin C.
This virus ugly one, one day feel fine, next day like truck drives you.
Measure saturation, goes 90 contact doctor. Protest virus spreading virus. Big brain move big Religion. We're country full people believe book tells earth 6k years old. Right issue misappropriating deaths, uncounted ones. panties. IQ guests increase reason cumulative total hospitalized ever covid US 262,712 that's incomplete data states, number probably bit higher. cumulative total tested positive US 3,230,991. 262,712 divided 3,230,991 0.081310037694. numbers wildly higher fucking flu, especially consider confirmed tests only. Many people hospitalized never tested. I'm going investigation arguing disingenuously bad troll.

The math actually works mouth breathing, covid denying moron. understand basic point isn‚Äôt u started stopped , it‚Äôs insurance companies cover costs every illness , make arbitrary rules don‚Äôt chip . Trump wore mask?... *cracks knuckles* ... let's spin negatively...

Masks suck now? Rite? understand frustrations outrage. really do. work store myself.

But would better getting fuck away idiots immediately calling cops. Getting altercation puts risk. worth it. Yes, would immensely satisfying break noses fools make suffer little teach lesson make think they're doing. 

It make dig say, ""See! right! attacked beliefs means correct!""

They find own, covid real, nasty kill people. matter time finally touches them. will, we're long battle pandemic. many people think things reopening danger past everyone sense eyes see knows far over. 

I'm still living like lockdown time avoiding going unless to. Mask on, avoid, avoid, avoid people. Stocking food ammo things get bad. will. idiots protesting masks acting like business usual get sick get caught food shortages hit. They're problem. can't stop stupid neither you.

As wearing face mask (and properly too). forget awesome unemployment rate, tanked economy mass homelessness access affordable Healthcare. KAGA! COVID19 symptoms... unfortunately severity COVID19 well :/. people believe faked moon landing, Soros pays millions protesters years, Bill Gates wants implant microchips everyone vaccines cause autism. media personalities tell things.

They believe anything told scientists scholars, like climate change, Covid19.

It's like one fungi infects insects, makes act completely contrary interests.

I'm sorry, must hard lose brother like this. HAHAHAHAHAH! LOL!  paying attention all? COVID also causes confusion, delerium, brain damage. version zombification far effective traditional kind. Trump finally deciding shut barn door horse bolted long ago. US may need buy space. Prostitution real, legal job Germany. Please keep fugly ass face covered, trump.

‚Ä¢ Risk: Small, in-person classes, activities, events. Groups students stay together and
with teacher throughout/across school days groups mix. Students remain least 6 feet apart share objects (e.g., hybrid virtual in-person class structures, staggered/rotated scheduling accommodate smaller class sizes).
‚Ä¢ Highest Risk: Full sized, in-person classes, activities, events. Students spaced apart, share classroom materials supplies, mix classes activities.‚Äù

You‚Äôll notice it‚Äôs highest risk THREE OPTIONS course is. Full-time in-person efforts space keep people safe definitely riskier all-online partial attendance. document say school ‚Äúone riskiest things could society,‚Äù post trying portray it. Parscale made those. Trump already committed mask. Exactly this. Plus, small flaw, small drawback, anything less N95-level protection branded ""Trump mask"" ""MAGA mask"" would blown media 24/7 like ""Trump mask good combatting Coronavirus"" we'd health experts television ranting ""nobody wearing Trump mask"".. etc. Everyone subreddit would banded Trump mask, people would burning making memes things done Trump masks effective... etc. We'd inundated instead got now. Yes read mothers posts? Thats horrible. child suffering dying kept promoting hydro anti-mask movements BLM protests? good point. actually strange experience yesterday hardees. coming home funeral needed use restroom went left husband asked get milkshake. Im dressed mnd wearing black cloth mask match dress. step aside let elderly gentleman behind place order, yells order girl (teenager) missed part asked repeat it. waves hand face yells ""TAKE GODDAMN THING CHICKEN SHIT"". 

I felt awful said ""Excuse me"" looks start tapping chest port pretty visible something think people immediately notice. ""Do see this? shes wearing mask, shes wearing protect people like get medicine keep us getting sick."" nods head said, ""Yeah? Oh alright"" 

Kinda freaking weird settled maybe think twice yells next person kid following company policy. wish said worded better like ""Dont harass girl shes wearing mask protect people like grumpy old ass"" lol. whatever...  vote. feel responsible. I'm attempt make smart people need arm up. know one taking guns away people. It‚Äôs time start showing too. won't, New York's buffoonishly incompetent response already infected 90% people state. Congrats reaching herd immunity, required murdering thousands seniors sending infected people wipe nursing homes. It‚Äôs July 2020 United States established universal mask policy states, all..... still debating airborne/droplet..... oh people still debating virus serious hoax. Good start friends.  way Trump fanatics got tired winning playing Covid19 team. That's impossible. No, *has* wrong. source prove study done show black people lower cognitive abilities? 

No need provide one showed grand old party does, everyone saw that. Well make spookier American Academy Pediatrics thinks kids back school fall. Hey going jeep kids school get vaccine 1,2,10 years.... Even get vaccine worlds ‚Äúone big liberal college campus‚Äù, quote South Park, majority population won‚Äôt get shot. One teacher incredibly optimistic. I‚Äôm keeping fingers crossed president ü§û really hoping overweight grossly unhealthy old man catches Covid. followers probably continue deny severity virus. proof claim infections minority communities consequence protests. Glad could clear up. Maybe delete misinformation posted above. fear going keep seeing headlines now...  Depending stress, read - first sentence could ‚Äúall done is... tories done later‚Äù ‚Äúher policies tories, earlier‚Äù 

I guess would fall internal vocalisation text small turn events could move trump virtual tie. could happen last week, like saw 2016. think many people making minds yet, crazy sounds. lot people like sister family. want fully support trump, they're waiting sign god. Essentially follow practice prayer wiser critical thinking everything already planned out. Creating plans rather praying sin, outcome usually punishment. millions praying simple sign. last week, trump could say 2nd term he'll use god prayer number one tactic achieve whatever pleases lord, electoral college slim margin like 4 long years ago. lmao fines also exponential, doubling fine every repeated offense...that could potentially bankrupt them, matter rich are. 1/100 people corona virus USA.  Ah yes, assumption I'd alone. üé∂caliFORniaüé∂ boogaloo militia doesn‚Äôt medics. live close Disney, could edit last 2 words, nobody's listening that. suggestion reopen schools get giant tents like kind rent weddings set outside. keeps sun rain steady supply nice clean air. 

That remote learning. two options see keeping less 1:1 transmission. We're tired winning!

-Covid19  hoax, two super healthy gym friends suddenly fall ill felt like close death? fully recovered now, feel like hoaxers need see eyes understand virus real potent. need spread awareness. bad someone like Trump wider voice outreach. article (among many many others read actual report properly) quoting flawed opinion piece, again, OPINION piece, Forbes. Oxford directly responded link 
 explain symptoms monkeys good thing?
  
The control group monkeys receive vaccine develop Covid sypmptoms
  
Also article Imperial College's vaccine, Oxford's also political nature, one tribe fancies uneducated idiotic base refute climate science various issues, tribe prides able handle science facts use shape better world. Apparently search party sent Cornyn's mind yet reported back. sure success even possible. Cue* Username checks out. called ""consent"". Completely anecdotal, I'm certain mask wearing definitely increased last weeks, good sign, London least. 2 weeks ago saw 10-15% wearing masks went out. probably closer 25 - 30%. Still long way go, can't say rest UK really taking seriously, bit push could definitely see universal mask wearing.

Edit: Gove said want mandatory face masks shops. led absolute dumbfucks. creating loads people disability rest life. good chance end increasing load.

A permanently disabled 40 50 year old, spent years paying system (which increases amount money get‚Äîsimilar social security) costs similarly ~4 old people died.  ships actually much New York. Took actual patients.

Compared New York, military intervention Texas huge. think it‚Äôs juxtaposition Disney flaunting public health policies (mask use washing stuff) prospect opening amusement park middle pandemic, state hot spot population resistant mask use seems asinine impossible safely proceed begin with. came Arizona's take Brexit. maybe posted cringe.

Deaths follow infections 3 weeks, means Sweden already way higher infections anyone else suspected least 2 weeks ahead nordic countries measures introduced. Norway already commented R0 dropping measures lockdown, Sweden estimating R0 close 7 February (which uncertain number way higher anything countries even estimate drops half). deaths important cases? Getting virus leave permanent damage last months. mention soon hospitals start filling (more already are) even healthy people need treatment get it, suffer die. virus black white situation, mindset ""if die corona harmless"" America right now.

(yes, old white people conservative, areas AZ mountainous cooler, main populations Phoenix Tucson ass-hot). Last x days probably. boss told buy better desk/chair. It‚Äôs gonna awhile. redeeming qualities. doesn‚Äôt shred charisma. completely missed point.

We know virus loves crowds.

Therefore, reason believe loves crowd less others.

If believe data shows problem, assume problem either data else person misinterpreting it. virus known quantity, know spreads crowds. Utah enough people consider group ""mob?"" moron like care know.

Poeple FEVERS months. damage, ongoing immune activity. Holy shit, think learned something this.

Thank link, I'm going call mom soon, ugh. Lol  You‚Äôre 100% right. It‚Äôs autistic screeching point doomers. Looks like Ivanka got ‚Äòrona.  anyone tried spread ass cheeks open let UV rays go directly body? It‚Äôs Arizona. plenty sunlight. Yes, that's exactly think data collected. numbers really low, little two people infected. said less accurate. operators buildings hire girls, provide accommodation girls self-employed. take refuse whatever customers come refuse perform services. sorry. thought said hadn‚Äôt looked numbers hadn‚Äôt seen wouldn‚Äôt said that. see it. Maybe aware accurate figure could use input calculation? 14x worse across demographics point he's trying make Trump known paying suppliers. federal government raised unemployment benefits $600 week top state pays individually. Even NY (one expensive states live in) could afford mortgage. Saying without irony: looking good there, Mr. President. covers face, vast improvement! Show death rate. Ok well would done dan Andrews position? Unplug ten minutes. tried that? mayor's wife list potential VP candidates  (Historically significant losses civil liberties baby steps) keep rules follow, section titled positive cases says similar also section immediately describes set covid 19 unit nursing home, rules have, Florida kind enough offer grant hospitals keep nursing home covid-19 required condition grant send back Skilled Nursing Facility soon possible even still positive, that's section CMS Grant May 11th there's parts page give recent instructions. grant still effect Tennessee tests staff twice week

Edit : again, feel free list ""many Florida counties"" said sending covid patients back nursing homes Yeah trump really fucked here. Imagine scenario playing parallel universe early March trump adopted mask principal ended selling MAGA‚Ñ¢ facemask &amp; sanitizer, could've curved spread curried favor independent voters undecideds, losing points already has. Firstly don‚Äôt forget teacher get PENSION. That‚Äôs HUGEEEE grand scheme earnings life.

Again teachers get lifelong pension. teacher worm 20-30 years get payed 60(if live long enough) can‚Äôt look take home paycheck evaluate jobs worth financial situation. shit makes news... wear fucking mask!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Personally I'd bet heat great job minimizing spread. Problem one heat, cram air conditioned spaces go outside actually increases spread. saw friend 2 hours outdoors AZ mask, tested positive following day. finished 14 day quarantine without symptoms. know anecdotal I'd bet 110F ideal going contact infected person.

Also said original point realize mask safety others. think people seem confused masks confused point. must secede order prevent Southerners infecting locals, prevent locals vacationing South bringing back corona. Scotland it‚Äôs masks everywhere. mandatory Scotland England? look excess deaths per day nordic countries see Sweden already excess week nordic countries locked down, weren't. Deaths follow infections 3 weeks, means Sweden already way ahead infections nordic countries (by least 2 weeks) implementing stronger measures changed that. Trump's one major policy issue (build wall) bordered comedy said Mexico would pay it.

That actually one sane plans initially. campaign site made clear planning sending Mexico invoice instead planned get money using [indirect like taking money US would sent Mexico foreign aid charging send money Mexico US. course, whoever wrote (it's coherent trump himself) keep trump opening mouth message got confused. got desperate enough start building wall people made fun using taxpayer money became getting ""paid back"", least beginning ridiculous media made appear. Remember claimed would replace Obamacare something better? zero information ""it'll terrific. It'll great!"" that's policy. 

His base care that. wanted everything Obama gone. Even passed GOP stopped trying get rid Obamacare, they've never replacement. Hes intolerant insulting extreme. know there's pile people love part personality, terrible trait politician

Exactly. lot people voted explicitly *wasn't* politician. seen positive thing. think supporters thought qualified would good politician. think expected cater needs/interests something politician them. Coal miners thought he'd get jobs back, racists thought he'd get rid brown people, scorched earthers wanted government failing fail could replaced something new.  


Ultimately make lot points showing he's good politician, appeal many none changes fact one could known would end meaning pandemic coming. Nobody warning people trump going start suggesting injecting disinfectants make states fight PPE. one right *now* knows he's going next. Probably took secret service 5 minutes put like unruly toddler. takes 10 minutes leave White House find shoes. real, lives worth much risk this. good luck district big try fire rehire all, one would want jobs meant dying.

All dishwasher? hell fingerprinting dishwashers giving 20 hours training? takes 1 minute training show someone use dish machine. probably poverty would double win. Get idiots wear masks give internet juicy meme material. Ah damn missed opportunity makes sad. US 36,000 traffic fatalities per year. average age death car crash? 38. Sound right? According actuary tables, average motor vehicle mortality steals 39.7 years life. So, 36,000 per year x 39.7 years 1,429,200 years life taken per year US motor vehicle accidents. 

Now, average covid-19 death? average age someone dying covid-19 78-81. Let‚Äôs use 79. Actuary tables show average 79 year old 8.4 years life left, covid-19 disproportionately affects already sick, ones dying covid-19 likely lower end figures cohort. odds dying covid-19 given age roughly par odds dying cause within one year age, likely average covid-19 victim year left lifespan, let‚Äôs generous say 4.2 years left average. puts years lost far due Covid US 570,650. 

Time tell future holds, even got it, time would take happen, still wouldn‚Äôt likely take much life motor vehicle accidents. end, we'll able say sweden got right completely over. makes sense every week say ""sweden botching it"" ""sweden winning it"". like pretending know winner marathon km number 5. Well, sure makes hopeful :) can‚Äôt wait get vaccination. Gosh 7-day trend deaths yesterday 11 less one week earlier. Looking single-day changes good way interpret overall trend. commented this, though, yesterday saw largest single-day week-over-week increase deaths since end May. 

We can't make conclusions single-day change fall line overall trend, much likely due deaths reported day - 7-day trend 87 July 9th, 74 July 10th 86 July 11th.

I wonder Americans comply lockdown!!111

It comes money. actually seen pic Obama Mas, yet.  strategy health care system uses deciding much resources put saving lives. Although isn‚Äôt exactly math, kind similar. Health care systems finite resources, constantly figure cases direct resources not. that, consider quantity quality years life saving. number lives. called QALY. 

I that. idea quality, pretty good ideas quantity.

And agree, number came occurred 4 months, full year. also know Sweden New York, 20 percent people become immune, daily new cases slow sharply. current high rates daily new cases won‚Äôt sustain, maybe seen far sustainable year, time 12 months pass, might fairly close number years life lost motor vehicle accidents period time, slow point. likely slow saw places rapid transmission far.

Oh recently average age death c-19 US calculated 80 math tiny bit off. years life lost due C-19 likely high. argue halving average years left actuary table arbitrary. sure guess, actuary tables arbitrary, know 8.28 absolute max average number years lost C-19 death nobody would argue multiplier 8.28. Thanks clarification! infected young female cult members clubbers. CFR probably already lower would outbreak spread evenly ages... realize Idaho even 577 people good explanation. think could also money laundering. odd names cabinets coupled price creepy own. DAMN HARD PUMPKIN HEADED MAN-CHILD? hate break sugar, US already ""depression mode"". Keeping shit open letting people die selfish short sighted. Classic Disney, won‚Äôt stop everyone‚Äôs parents dead.  EU experienced new outbreaks clusters, like NRW, national state governments reacted swiftly. one deems over. You‚Äôve tough time wanna say you‚Äôre crazy think points reasonable. never thought, back March, would testing July. live California, still easy get test. tried schedule community testing appointment. Nothing available Project Baseline last WEEK checked. different community testing program next available appointment WEEK today. called doctors office said can't get test limited tests enough symptoms.

Oh way, last time got test Project Baseline took 8 days get results. 

And course, federal govt, instead investigating trying help, saying testing great, phenomenal need efficient testing, need slow down....... respectable thing I've seen do. Props suppose, better late never. Yes going fine.
But older people interact aren‚Äôt going fine.

Furthermore: one idea long term effect body, might lot Chronic syndromes popping caused COVID. God asshole mysterious ways  ENOUGH propaganda. It‚Äôs supposed dill pickle. Fauci heavily invested creating vaccines mass profits. Testing costs money takes time, bad profits. 
Fauci's wife sole person CDC approve vaccine use without proper testing (why fuck even thing allowable?) media can't even mention giant conflict interest?
Why? I‚Äôm aware that, shocked. know handled things poorly didn‚Äôt expect things much worse US.

Next catastrophy pending, full Brexit, thanks dumb dumb Boris...According read negotiations, still unclear UK even want except full access without responsibilities whatsoever, question always was. seems like negotiation position shifting weekly base, leaving EU negotiators puzzled really want.

I hope EU give buys another bunch years negotiations get act together, atm everything steers full hard Brexit, worst options add top Corona deep trouble :-(

This like running open eyed catastrophy nothing except making things worse every day. Blacks Hispanics/Latinos dying disproportionate rates:

The situation general indeed compared. possible virus indeed transmittable kids 12 though. That's CDC stated start change. Schools closed public afraid. see change opening again.

Well let's wait see indeed. hope situation similar, kids &lt;12 transmit virus much.

Lol downvotes. ""we fucked murdered tons people benefit, absolute worst!!11""

Somehow compelling argument.

There‚Äôs many people trying make everything political statement here, people disbelieve affect don‚Äôt take precautions case, folks know borderline suicidal it. latter say things like ‚Äúif gets gets me, I‚Äôm going spend time sitting around home‚Äù, understand gets boring cabin fever completely avoidable. lot foolish people here. 

Someone work died Covid, first thing everyone asks old he, going help dismiss it. (Late 40s early 50s.) Thats fantastic detective work Scooby Dumb. Perhaps delve little bit deeper comments section. Wow... Starvation huh? realise usa 3rd world country. world went shut since months ago. see millions starved death. sorry disagree. lot things government done wrong crisis. But, wearing masks issue personal responsibility. government restricting people people wearing masks.

This decision people wear masks. upsets fact selfishly choosing wear masks prolongs crisis increases number innocent people get sick die virus including elderly health care workers. I've told relatives repeatedly, think finally starting sink in: pretend start world war. return normalcy question vaccinate 70% global population.

I plan start Christmas shopping soon knows malls open December, supply chains severely impacted outbreaks warehouses manufacturing plants. still thought good point would‚Äôve completely overlooked Thankfully, several viable vaccine candidates around timing oxford‚Äôs Kids too. we've seen government, care kids. many people get covid sit home
And play video games day night long for
Months. Asking friend. rationalizing here. leave house I'm scared much virus (since actually take precautions based science) ignorance someone like you. 

Air quoting science way dismiss things inconvenient. Living many people means NONE people leave house much. Even small family, one perso go minimize risk. 

This rocket surgery. simple, effective really debate. 

Privilege means never consequences knowing things. 

/r/coronavirus NOTHING people showing specifically adjust life due consequences presence virus. 

AS SAID post, MUCH people's response based continuing vote politicians prioritize rich people's interests DECADES. Thereby creating MASSIVE income inequality problem, leads larger consequences certain Bad Things happen, virus like one.

Our political economic systems BROKEN. last issue based ignorance fact also. Maybe instead complaining Coronavirus, get active politically reverse vast inequalities create desperation feeling now.

You might notice people that. think BLM movement is? Mondays think slowest days labs closed Monday. Florida tends increase week goes on, starting Tuesday. I'm sorry, hope friend pulls through. u-u state's hope full shutdown?

Yes. hope anything that's anywhere full lock down, failing leaders completely unwilling shut going get astronomically worse. I'm one those. criminal. I'm regular Joe though. fine wearing mask.

&amp;#x200B;

But can't done fine someone never washing hands mask touching time never wearing properly.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck without proper care masks increase viral spread. Hard enforcement increase resistance tenacity people. find ways payback kind things.

&amp;#x200B;

Trying force people wear masks going increase tenacity sheer anger make people intentionally use masks napkin cleaning cloth. make spread worse. I'm devastated. wife lost jobs leave city, place housing Alabama. went this, supposed staying inside, go back place part. I'm sure I'm going quarantine it.

This sucks. worked months least government wasted time...oh well! Crazy Americans going read think, ""No! No! No! We're failures! We'll show letting get even worse!"" Records different records country. NY still top three states believe. Certainly among highest new infections per 100k population.  Businesses file bankruptcy avoid continuing pay debt. going prevent coming back. I'm sure many brands theaters historically declared bankruptcy yet still movie theaters. dense. assumed military still cared military. irresponsible dangerous assumption make without scientific data. 

I live Manhattan. There's tons people still social distancing. Masks still required public places stores. Inside bars restaurants still closed. vast majority people see street still wearing masks.

So yes, tell mask wearing social distancing one best contact tracing systems world Work retail. 4 co-workers test positive COVID past 6 weeks. way get tested AZ unless start feeling symptoms.

Hence fudging numbers. Sweden fine all, compared neighbouring countries similar spikes took different measures. Antibodies cells. always wane shortly body eradicates infection, theres need expend lot energy something longer need. body respond faster second infection theoretically neutralize virus becomes problem. matter time though, longer go without reintroduced virus slower antibody response, boosters things. Also virus mutates significantly infections could potentially bypass current defenses. particular virus new really possible say certainty people developed long term natural immunity. article seems click baity honestly. know someone personally Illinois visiting Florida keys right I'm end friendship city March April. super annoying -I work city- knew going go longer wouldn‚Äôt let us cancel anything two weeks out. come another reason hold mass protests middle fucking pandemic. Nah - would better demanding stores hire security deal assholes.

I lived years even considering buying house settling (hence random Utah knowledge!). That‚Äôs noticed incredibly low property tax rates hover around ~0.5% allowing insane speculation real estate prices there. average house costs way US average doesn‚Äôt necessarily result higher monthly mortgage payment.

That‚Äôs made connection people generally pay less taxes general local services like public education ended pretty turned off.

I‚Äôm saying money necessarily better, definitely think combination factors play here. Trump republican party now.

It's 7 months major spread Asia.

It's 5 months since Europe North America major spread started rapidly testing.


Where reinfections?

Why ONE SINGLE CONFIRMED CASE REINFECTION. come can't find ONE? media attention, spread, millions test done every fucking day, hundreds thousands new cases day, millions week, mountains researchers following still can't find ONE example?

According news articles scores people would re-infected.

Why HCW tested positive March April reinfected now? Zero? PPE fucking good ONE nurse doctor exposed twice? people thought immunity back Spring beat virus and/or tested positive antibodies.....none re-infected? mean tens thousands people ""beat virus"" back March April vacationing places like Florida week? NONE caught again?

Really? testing wife, hospital, Monday procedure Wednesday I'm assuming results wed. Solano county. always known brother smartest person, happened yesterday... still shock lol.

1. already stated, preliminary studies, type thing one would use make policy decisions
2. peer reviewed (I suppose may changed since studies first released).
3. studies cut short country study ongoing (mid February mid March [about 4 weeks] longest IIRC) ended cancelling school. studies supposed last 8 weeks long.
4. studies carried country (France, Israel, Germany) recall correctly large scale community spread.
5. studies conclude kids cannot spread virus, rather **suggest** KIDS AGE 10 **might** transmit virus high rate.
6. studies conclude issue children acting vectors deserves studied more. 

That's it, that's best say them.

Gotcha thanks! say lied, didn't. say change minds changing mind indicates contemplating subjective, personal issue rather objective, factual public health issue.

What Fauci stated facts changed, did. time said public need masks, didn't. Masks would significant public benefit recommendations lockdowns, self-isolation social distancing guidelines followed.

As goal protecting 'public heath', *your* health, ensuring frontline health care workers prioritized use PPE people supposed self-isolating completely logical.

Recommending masks time would exacerbated existing medical grade PPE shortages (which still exist medical grade mask gown material still critically short supply) healthcare workers still desperatly need public supposed isolating themselves. would likely also created even greater belief guidelines could ignored wore mask, accelerating rejection failure initial isolation guidelines.

But morons, including political leadership, started protesting openly violating recommended preventative guidelines fashionable cloth masks (which unlike medical grade masks, made easily sourced mass produced materials) started mass produced became readily available acceptable public, noted new facts adjusted recommendations accordingly. 

That's science works.

Those new facts, along others like recognition many people comply recommendations whatever are, led current recommendation people wear cloth masks (and still **not** wear medical grade PPE) public. learn something new people start behaving differently, they'll adjust recommendations again, again, based new facts come. they're lying now, people like Fauci act fact rather faith facts change. Great, 79% go herd immunity. saying months ago. MAGA, Lives Matter, NRA, Confederate flag masks. care message, whatever takes wear it! Congress work around 10th Amendment preempting state law? theory, Congress somehow managed develop coherent, nationalized plan, could probably pass using commerce clause authority supremacy/necessary proper clauses Constitution justification.

Unquestionably right decision. clear who's trolling here.

Then also know people very, sick home COVID, two people hospitalized (but put ventilator). 

I know one person died it.

It incredible differently people react. One woman nonchalant anti-mask got it. symptoms loss taste smell. wears mask EVERYWHERE tells people virus real. freaked out. 

On flip side, one guys hospitalized others whose dad died still post COVID overblown need reopen economy social media time... seem like lot strep going around back February. friend's baby wife caught strep.

Oh people ok‚Äôd bounties on? one ever seen JAWS? that's tested/confirmed find complete BS US sits 130K deaths 2 months... yeah ain‚Äôt way jumped 130K suddenly death relate become super slow.

""...you see people who‚Äôve recovered really get back normal things highly suggestive myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic fatigue syndrome. Brain fog, fatigue, difficulty concentrating something really need seriously look well might post-viral syndrome associated covid-19""

This danger oversimplifying situation. death statistic mean ""you clear"". Far it. wonder, time pandemic said done, percentage people suffer long-term effects higher death rate. Nah. care anyone. Nah photo op Joe Rogan Bill Burr discussion masks Joe trying give crap wearing mask, Joe dropped radar.

I would periodic updates Fauci. True... Although people still stupid shit. neighbors kids playing outside together day anyone said yet many deaths occurred UK compared case numbers?

There proportional amount cases proven positive lack test availability. Ha, good one! That‚Äôs *exactly* he‚Äôs them.

It's gotten point seen ""those unsafe, likely infected people"".

**You're moron.**

Unfortunately, one see one understand anything you. even comment. god damn stupid, know help even know posted what.

This absolutely hilarious, crucifying comment even make, think clear moron is. Yes it‚Äôs lump sum agreed payment services. covid need resources. aren‚Äôt charging respirator; price includes ppe, isolation room, specific staff, etc. 
that LOW figure since it‚Äôs Medicare. Hospitals actual bill (balance bill) would probably 10X Medicare pay. Dear God think you‚Äôre right.

Why ask questions like ""why couple countries 150k per 1m tests per capita? "" - trust numbers coming from, (say) Germany France stopped testing virus many weeks ago?

Do people modicum intelligence see numbers many cases, fudged inadequate testing? someone outside US, I'm pretty sure lot people stop wearing masks events concerts back soonish, virus fizzled anything... favorite story 37 year old vet port Clinton died covid refusing wear mask. guessed 7 figures US starts take seriously  Yes!! parents always asking old people preexisting conditions hear someone badly affected covid. matter. crazy is, parent house isn‚Äôt total nutcase, without around I‚Äôd kinda screwed. true, sure it‚Äôs uniquely american problem.

The US version rigged way, democracy itself.

Look Europe versions comparison.

Not nearly bad US version, would say.

But still, states selling democracy ridiculous.

\*cough\* Russia \*cough\* studied Scotland, Germany US. Yes idiots everywhere US many. behind times. numbers show fucking dangerous party anti-intellectualism unfortunately covid extent damage caused. numbers around covid blatantly show bad is. going outside increase chance spreading virus vulnerable. It‚Äôs fun games it‚Äôs grandparents catch die much making people vote. freedom vote that's want do. try encourage people exercise right, that's do.

Plus, look things keep people voting. Work, school, voting restrictions. shitty policies place. Well lot people wearing masks states weak mask mandates. Unless changes forced shutdown. Prepare worst, hope best. may ask scared virus? lethal, hell flu bit worse. Also scared leave doesnt mean dont freedom leave do, choose leave fear outside world now, thats problem deal everyone else's.  third world country. quote suggests staff members likely infected children people working professions. 

I read abstract paper. suggest risks elementary schools may lower adult workplace. data high schools meaningful since Sweden's open timeframe study. Additionally, plenty examples show clusters occur early childhood settings. 

Not disagreeing definitely know enough, although I'd say CDC take opening fully highest risk options certainly correct. People need realize COVID doesnt give fuck believe They‚Äôre still stage they‚Äôre taking seriously. numbers climb. need stop thinking like numbers down. lie post. criminal.

*Hooray!!!!* truly feel others actually care.
Its odd me. Toronto, every single person wears mask. 

I hope ok. Keep good fight.

History watching taking notes. 2.5% death rate seems realistic weeks hospital system collapses. I'm one. We're middle worst pandemic 100 years stupid fucks making wearing mask political stance. can't unite common threat dont think America ever unite anything. mention healthcare system joke people going bankrupt losing everything medical debt that's become political stance issue too. president dottering narcissistic sociopath refusing acknowledge worst crisis america seen decades amd instead focusing attention stoking racial class division us.

I think inevitable crippling recession U.S. rolling end country global power was. sad pathetic joke rest world. China flattened curve definitely going make moves take solidify new economic super power. 

I worried, depressed, dont sleep well days. Here's running 7-day average deaths across US (from pandemic dashboard statmap.org): heatmap US counties per capita deaths: Test rate matter. positive rate 5% test enough. 8% means lost control terms testing. 

And last 3 weeks rate positive tests increased 4-5% nearly 8% now. find twice many infected people ~10% tests. 

For Arizona tests increased 160%. number positive cases 1000%. test 3 times much find 11 times many cases lost control. doubt second, fuck Twitter data? really taking seriously source we? reaches nearly inconceivable depths pettiness. Basically said, except also said research stop. also stop analyzing results already received it.

Other organizations like VA, US department retired soldiers, stop lancet study whatever wants say, results. governor said hospitalization number dipped 800 first time since March 18, average toll seven deaths 72 hours first since eve St. Patrick‚Äôs Day

Americans low standards. places active infections. Florida also 3rd populous state. Manager store work says company expects Covid around problem another 17-23 months(was year half two years said it). Uhhh haven‚Äôt realized it, ‚Äúworld‚Äôs best healthcare system‚Äù isn‚Äôt hot right now. didn‚Äôt even enough PPE doctors places still don‚Äôt. mention fact huge percentage Americans can‚Äôt even access afford ‚Äúamazing‚Äù healthcare Cases aren‚Äôt going either. place hotbed misinformation. sure contact tracing even possible certain percentage population infected large. India handling well initially, gave reopened anything contained. 

I think India's size, also needs temporarily erect internal borders states stop people sicker states infecting cleaner ones. Europe's advantage, managed control dangerously runaway situation, comprise independent countries shut cross-border travel. Big countries like India, USA, Brazil impossible contain without first partitioning smaller isolated units, fight Covid manageable local level. get cases current levels seen Europe, start allowing travel. greatest country world, sure used be

So... Make America Great Again? Sorkin-ized Trump speech.   
Harkening back mythical period America great, yet can't say was. independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) overseeing trial met April 27 review data shared interim analysis study team. Based upon review data, noted remdesivir better placebo perspective primary endpoint, time recovery, metric often used influenza trials. Recovery study defined well enough hospital discharge returning normal activity level.  results indicate patients received remdesivir 31% faster time recovery received placebo (p&lt;0.001). Specifically, median time recovery 11 days patients treated remdesivir compared 15 days received placebo. Results also suggested survival benefit, **mortality rate 8.0% group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6% placebo group** (p=0.059).


my understanding Remdesivir lot negative unexpected side effects...esp patients need drugs. may need take conjunction drugs improve chemistry.

but 11 percent vs 8 percent mortality. may beneficial give patients certain circumstances, hardly feels like game courses epidemiology teach John Hopkins? Agree virus doesn‚Äôt vary, suggesting impact NZ US? actions vs effect? go work Monday-Wednesday too. Yay... Next time ask much lung damage / brain damage etc. ok, much would much. Goddamn they're worse vegans Thanksgiving. thing amazed work state government. honestly expect radical change like that. friend real, friends thought kidding became pretty big joke, he's lying apparently. years, goes outside spreads asshole sun while. came recently dad lost job complaining go outside morning like used to. Says energy dopamine something something.  agree much better precautions taken EU, using logic could justify lie could potentially save lives. agree 100% logical thinking gave way gut uneducated feeling 2016. People rather believe guy YouTube video knows guy says they're lying us everything.

Also funny, last point, regarding they're believe economists, military person, Ivanka's husband makes sense. However Bill Gates gets flak group people trying help get vaccine there, argument...... HE'S DOCTOR.

I'm scared country everyone swayed internet stories convincing everyone stop believing government experts, scientists. Anyone who's discredited MUST RIGHT. 

Although one government, expert, scientist know everything perfect, need believe they're giving us best chance real answers solutions.  online friend Texas. believes another flu media evil overreacting..... Tru story :|  Uhh nope. one badly. mostly places ‚Äúpeaked‚Äù virus new. Arizona ‚Äúpeaking‚Äù opinion 5 months later! means caused happen themselves. 

The stats insanely different US countries nothing population. ha !

&amp;#x200B;

as face covered, attractive is. Yes right. However took strong measures early strong shutdown maintained pandemic. Canadians need wear masks well much different place US right now. indeed sick coffee breath inside mask like much hides face bc I'm shy fuck. Can't believe people Seriously fighting something simple wearing mask outlier US shithole country damned thing combat virus. consistent thing countries actually something much lower cases countries nothing. Mom convinced ""people pay attention President's way think do,"" mentioned refusal wear one contributed absolute idiocy display country. probably like trying put muzzle dog. know kids 12 vectors, wait see. jailed denied bail faces 6 months prison and/or $4,000 fine. certain minimum would fine. 

Back Lockdown man pretended Covid went around coughing people supermarket practical joke. sentenced 16 months prison. yeah, NZ court system takes kind thing seriously. both. election symptom, autocracy fascism perpetuated measurable disease. true. roughly 1/3rd population Glennrowan!

(Look Melbourne Glennrowan (location animatronic ‚ÄúNed Kelly Experience‚Äù) settlements whose names know Victoria. I‚Äôm sorry.) Since freedom baked value U.

The kind people dumb enough bring kids amusement park (and places) probably people masks, figure offended video...


My take WD marketing people knew target audience wanted mask videos, legal people advised it, open litigation... 

? Oh sorry, oops. downvoted heard cover nose! Celiac *wrecks* whole body. friend severe Celiac. mother literally died young (early 50s). eats wheat trance amount, he's physically mentally comission month. Thank you. means lot. know clear comment I'm actually irate folk home state OH NYC. New York amazing much people gone way part. Apart NYPD (who apparently immune covid never see wearing masks) I've amazed good city done. miss selflessness go home. I‚Äôm American. Like said don‚Äôt think America open schools. like said before, don‚Äôt think blame kids. I‚Äôm Canada reopening schools September model close Netherlands, I‚Äôm ok it. Bars indoor dining still closed, believe stay way. Nobody going care Americans care. amount preconditions testing vary greatly.  Yeah real. virtual appointment doctor they‚Äôve history issues would excaberated mask wearing carry around ID card whatever that‚Äôs issued doctors health department. Please correct I‚Äôm wrong don‚Äôt people produce papers support animals? would bad require people lol look back March think ‚Äúoh sweet summer child‚Äù Unfortunately dealing two pandemics, ignorance one them.  like eating? Yeah, people need keep working make happen. Posting reddit? People work keep site running. 240+ years inbreeding nation Lancet meta study 70 studies. Masks work. gew die make take seriously. 1918 pandemic, anti-mask league, thr exact thing people today. approach saving economy working yet? economy still fucked added unmanageable number sick people die? bad accurately clarify science someone half remembered skimming Reddit working memory correlated low compliance guidelines. lower working memory also correlated lower IQ. low compliance correlated low IQ.

1. correlated B correlated C guarantee C causally related m

2. showing correlation one single study far cry ""this 100% objective measured fact, especially claiming fact partly related conclusion study.

Is likely people lower intelligence likely non compliant mask orders? Yes. imply anyone wearing mask unintelligent? No. mean super duper genius wear mask? No. 

People love take half baked hot takes misinterpreted science fuel confirmation bias genius master race anyone otherwise dummy. try remind reality science pedantic, unless science actually agrees them, fine.

Edit: scientific articles sunspot activity end fueling ""IMMINENT ICE AGE APPROACHING* headlines Joy Covid... old kids? 4 year old puts mask give him. struggled first wearing properly (he'd keep nose out) we'd correct take long figure out. Maybe need explain kids.

If they're 2 nobody expecting wear mask. don‚Äôt think helmet laws good comparison. Yes, people wear helmets life risk don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt mind choose wear one. 

With mask, others lives putting risk wearing it. That‚Äôs makes angry. really scientific studies experience military training. got training defending us B weapons. learned long kind protection helps. kind masks people told wear help minutes people wear day long. That's pathetic; surely find plot land send excavators. ... numbers spreading *his* base, he's sudden wearing mask. sensible hypothesis. He's exactly hiding voter suppression tactics. 
 
Btw, mention yet let Roger Stone, convicted criminal man openly blackmailed him, hook? addition, know, operators need licensed believe Prostitutes need register get health checks. jobs let quarantine? Welcome Age Anti-Intellectualism. everybody expert everything nothing. simple, yes. Sadly, effective, since he's preaching choir. never will. family members go (which actually likely atm), continue think like that. me, stop blaming AZ. media says world's worst outbreak. Reality shit everywhere else. Quiet. Calm. Tiny tiny tiny percentage population exhibiting signs illness. PANDEMIC!!!!!!!!!! Probably not, right % positive increases, probably underestimating real cases more. Usually overcrowded living conditions large families, combined working jobs little social distancing. Two Americas: haves nots.

The haves hoping nots keep believing work hard enough welcomed comfortable America. think overly pessimistic ""69 times"" figure, since less less people iteration. No, kids won‚Äôt able go back school collectively overreacted virus survival rate. No. getting it. normal, natural response gross country. Yes. also turns Scots population centre common sense... I‚Äôm really sure Trump Devos would able touch Title 1 funds. Yeah rash comment sitting eat. think I'll go back completely keeping mouth shut anything protest related  Democrats? Also bad. behind UK now.

Edit: depending detail list. looking different list posted below. UK deaths 660/mil US 415/mil. Couple euro countries between. rates range far fewer cases. example close hitting Sweden‚Äôs total daily basis. 

Of course, rate go experience continued growth number cases, many countries top end list contained.  Where's ""lol expect us trust anything comes China"" posters? miss guys. Yeah people dying, quit piece shit political headlines fact Arizona comparable Europe say enough really. ‚ÄúThe statewide mask campaign attempt state break population giving control bodies attempting encroachments freedom,‚Äù Bradley wrote.

These people want make abortions illegal government tell women bodies.

Idiots. girls easily make $10k month pay taxes. real want be? Anyone remember thought Covid gonna fizzle hot summer resurface Fall? cute fairytale. bend cough wall. disease cause ghastly symptoms like boils, lumps, disfigurement scary fast going vertical. basically exponential almost like measures taken slow growth.......... link, loved parody Jurassic Park reopening. *all age fatness* 
Thank fren üôåüèªüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ Lol. person talking wanted explain ""your opinion.""

And went ahead made monumental effort so. point say knew this. point lot things could done knew. Even then, could humble take precaution careful even think bad. arrogant. take risk. risk decide take go even think hoax. risk hoax. Theyre arrogant. paying price. given reading/listening UK media due derail conversation issue topic.

I find steange simple thinks UE (I mean Yropp) months open debate USA justificate ""political polarization"". really serious, many neighbours loss local community realize truly gloomy reality. Well, shit going everywhere picked two statistics linked together ignoring everything else. people obviously waited covid get guns unleash shit.

A certain way push forward ideas, sure... Isn‚Äôt people mask ? coincidence. üé∂ Facts care feelings üé∂  forget #sharpiegate!! Always remember! Wow actually completely forgot healthcare free America. Yikes ""context"" magical word people use counter argument. Reminds trumps doctor hide veggies food get eat Here's another thing too: cases reported.

South Dakota's DOH website *only* reports SoDak people tourists. Pennington County (my country) tourist heavy, lesser degree South Dakota. So, tourist comes in, gets tested sick, *they counted*. idea report stats state country origin SD DOH declined give information us. 

That's fact. There's theories governors trying downplay numbers, Florida caught cooking data? recall. long last learned hate country deplorable idiots made damn despicable. Correction. It‚Äôs experimental. Total cases deaths literally nothing reopen. get people listened oh wait New record tomorrow! think we're going topping entire world's numbers state September.  99% go People seem fully grasped yet. Isaac Asimov said: Anti-intellectualism¬†has constant thread winding way political cultural life, nurtured false notion democracy means 'my ignorance good knowledge.  American, it‚Äôs get **much**, **much** worse next month. U.S. set world records virus since many things still open mask usage/business closures aren‚Äôt strictly enforced. hospital used large part insufficient ICU trained staff operate Um, likely should, understanding actions take hand. three actions taken towards people race fact. 

It‚Äôs clear didn‚Äôt read thread. That‚Äôs okay. inside USA, go donate blood, tell possess antibodies. Beyond that, know way get tested easily. say postal votes can't trusted refuse leave White House.  
Scary stuff. many people convince him. noticed trend fb. started vocal minority turned many cult following fake, hoax, masks don‚Äôt shit, freedumbs. Shit spread fast virus. 

Fuck guy. part problem. die doesn‚Äôt turn dipshit hero. like every smoker knows it‚Äôs bad, act surprised get lung cancer. facts there. said felt like really bad flu something else felt really ""odd"". went hospital sent home told self isolate. said room severe symptoms. says nothing protestors. Try again. would never legal even were, people would forge documentation. think British demands unrealistic nothing ever successfully negotiated. 6 feet standing still outdoors. AC inside no-go. I'm making argument I'm pointing Florida basically exact thing New York reaped Whirlwind yet, although mid June Florida suffered half covid-19 deaths nursing homes, would say lot older population. month two easier look overall nursing home population state make fair comparison

Although originally stating Florida sending nursing home patients back covid-19 move goalposts unfortunately Florida game beginning 1% small number talking deaths, 1% 1%. 2 year olds according CDC guidelines wear mask unsafe. So, consider that. yes, see plenty kids older 2 wearing mask shit annoying.  Luckily 4 year old mature even many adults issues wearing one. link interested reiterate, exemplary case Austria.

A tourist mountain town 45% percent positive cases test coverage 70% citizens. deathrate around 0.25%. Fact 85% people tested either got mild symptoms all.

However number still taken absolutely, environmental factors play here. Alpine mountain towns usually good air year round given tourist hotspot demographic, probably lot old people lived outside isolated. mention people can't even afford hospital stay kind right now. American here. leadership care get sick, long medical system rob us estates medical bills lay dying hospital. 

Yeah, come here. fucking disaster right foreseeable future. suggesting fines &amp; forced labour supporting wrong side? sides could bring laws places control penalising side, reasonable reasons. called 14 days quarantine Even many stories stop careless morons continuing wrong thing. Thats Europe Black Death. threw entire continent Dark Ages recover Millennium. casinos Louisiana FILLED people Texas refuse wear masks. every single casino absolutely social distancing. Today governor announced closing bars, casinos allow stay open. casino associate, freaking dread going work every day scold grown ass people yell fake news every time try enforce masks, let alone fear well being. Completely this. probably pretty scary data they‚Äôre crunching well. Dubai here, harsh lockdown required us permits leave home day hours later two days. Things pretty much stabilized hospitals covid free. mandated masks, enforced 800$ fine well social distancing isn‚Äôt always followed made restaurants bars feel abit safer. Life getting back normal hope US may get soon! Stay safe guys. senator remain dark Trump tells him. actual term ""pneumonia unknown etiology"", medical jargon meaning ""yes, pneumonia, can't figure what's causing it"". Kazakhs seem using designation probable cases COVID-19 laboratory confirmed. strictly wrong, would probably caused less confusion classified something else (like ""probable COVID-19""). hoax??? Yet conversely, bone spurs... 
I guess goes show courage comes many forms? people refuse change, others testing new ideas. eg r/republicofne [He's finally wearing CA scary info probably might lose election stance COVID-19. can't believe man saw anything deaths Americans due covid-19 scary besides something like losing. End July going bust positives backed everyone exposed July 4th. Quick!! discharge them?!? insinuates gives fuck people. He'd fire whoever refused near him. Make sure takes penicillin prescribed, call primary care provider (family doctor) go hospital discharge notes available, unless discharge papers family doctor adaqutely explain need test, would recommend get tested Covid asap get pulse oximeter, normal reading least 92% unless chronic smoker, start fall come back deep breathing exercises, call 911 follow instructions. Recommend family wear mask around monitor closely, read CDC guidelines caregivers case contagious. Covid pnuemonia trigger delirium, confusion altered behavior, elderly Covid patients less likely present fever younger patients. Take care good luck family. CDC guidelines: cannot purchase pulse oximeter local pharmacy, explain situation, pharmacies tell stock keep emergency stash situations like this. really one, try calling pharmacies same. don‚Äôt right right? So... solution Aliens future AI create: please save us ourselves. morons. Freedumb! knew 1% would feel disgusting. obvious. virus spreading countries tropical climates...what would stop spreading summer weather here? Nobody going see account balance market drops. 

Losing election Joe Biden, that's embarrassing. stat looking ""excess deaths"" USA 360 NY NJ? It‚Äôs complicated really is. many things built system either politically racially baked really complicated fix. Purely sociological level. mechanics. know far beside point, smaller cities (less quarter million pop guess), feel long you‚Äôre idiot, it‚Äôs generally safer everyone jaywalk. Crossing intersection, worry cars coming four directions, mention idiots ignoring traffic laws. middle road intersection, there‚Äôs two directions worry about, wait minute break traffic. trick always assume every car blind run let them, see jaywalking issue people step traffic assuming people stop them, feel that‚Äôs less jaywalking problem idiot problem. üò± OMG didn‚Äôt even think lockdown drills! kids needing crammed corner dark least half hour admin check confirm teachers complying properly procedure. highly doubt district continue require pandemic go back maybe I‚Äôm trusting leading.  Cytokine storm Waited 8 days normal inconclusive got rapid next day 15 min later results much research IHR COVID-19 available, [this theoretical estimates infection hospitalization rate 1.8% state New York. Trump lied us told us best people. Fauci, CDC, Surgeon General medical experts whoo look advice. gave us bad info beginning pandemic. ""I know"" (which acceptable scientist say), ""most us need wear masks"", dead wrong. Literally dead wrong thousands Americans. best people anymore Trump's taxes.  Yet CO2 levels rose much slowly compared they‚Äôre rising now. Plants animals able adapt changes. things happen thousands millions years it‚Äôs 100 years. plenty here. Especially Long Island.  know that? country cover something found late december 2019 informed next day?

You know country experience abnormalities noy understand, shove problem rug like US does, consult world experts help them, China did. Working helped create genome country, critical helping act faster. Asian countries general much better Europe. China recovered 4 months secret vaccine developed either, took quarantine seriously. US fucked calling Chinese-only problem, yet evidence virus back home long cases appeared wuhan. lead poisoning dating dum dum? True. Put way, 7 times people Texas died ""flu"" year already last year altogether... I‚Äôd love know party breakdown many vocally anti-common-sense safety measures. seriously step right direction! Sir, proud American, just... thank :) PS wear mask personally know several coworkers struggling effects. One post COVID CHF, ejection fraction 40%-45% range. Previously healthy , fit 30 year old.

 Miniature trump.  pictured bobble head. said Fox News sin mainstream subreddits #( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) would look that. remember much school different administrations. Yea really is. funny thing lot movies TV shows based around antagonist ideology. would think we'd get haha 

I think first comment big part solution. need improve education system aspects. texts intellectual parts also trying incorporate empathy respect others either study abroad, arts, even way play sports. Also history classes show good guys lot situations. lot countries view us big bully sometimes right thing, others right hate us usually good reason. lucky awesome US history teacher showed us many sides every part history. 175,000 people expected die. kidding? working exactly intended. country's tired me.

I'm going Germany. name Fritz!

I love sweet sauekraut. makes ears stick out.

From ev-errrr-y mount-ain side. Let sauer-kraut sprout. No, get back explain. Time put 99% room 1% infected let till got ! sickened twice shy baby major issue around US state leaders nothing protect elderly. Remember took home wine making course forgot drive? study 26 different studies says IFR one thing two people internet quickly maul statistic fit imaginary narrative. Par course last four months... Funny people like like ‚Äúand believe them?‚Äù experts msm, blindly believe asinine sources. It‚Äôs tragic way enlighten someone dumb realize stupid projecting guilty others. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Time send medical ship gulf! got joke? don‚Äôt think anyone could actually seriously write that. make laugh though thanks that. never thought anyone could embody Reddit pseudo-intellectual neckbeard stereotype completely. Regarding first paragraph, I'm betting flu researcher interesting studies planned winter, flu season taking place environment people care getting sick once. common flu comes back constantly mutates. call thing never virus. Covid mutate anywhere near much common cold flu.

But yeah heard immunity work stop going disease. absolutely prevent second wave spreading manage stop first one. people quite contagious becoming immune idea heard immunity fix Covid ridiculous. 

So yes course point disease fizzle can't infect new hosts either dead immune. Zika outbreak Brazil would example happening. 60% population infected went away. issue go away would mean 10 million dead US. Oh, god damn it. don‚Äôt want thinking lil Vienna sausage! Fuck you. got you, fam: look week back years, right today. see huge (I counted 50,000 extra deaths) spike Feb/Mar/Apr last year. GROUP? WTF?? Florida considerably worse Texas, per capita, neither *yet* bad New York peak. That's weird way spell Putin. Unfortunately, could **totally** true. hoping people safe good time Disney, soon single case reported Disney, whole fucking magical dream turn shit. hate accurate is. Im sure enough ""proof"". Maybe enough conclude likely false positive. chances false negative much higher swab tests. doctor told high 50%, read online says 30%. 30%, two negative tests 10% chance false negatives. False positives swabs range 0.2 3%. antibody tests right arent great either adding seems like probably realm toss up.  expecting would happen quite time. base full simpletons forget comparing face mask mandates Holocaust. I'm still trying figure daily statistics keep coming out, people tested 6 weeks ago got results. Parents promised kids Disney world vacation. think study takes account infected. look official US numbers around 5%. catch 1 10 actual IFR .5% aligned study results. Remindme! 2 months point, he's put 20 balls water score totally fucked he's almost balls.

You must talking different Trump self-scored scorecard Trump know shows eagled every hole even wrote note next hole water trap.
""Clearned water trap 150yds, bestest shot history golf."" h index? average score? must missing something. mortality rate possibly 10% 6% thinking mortality rate people get virus die it. anyone said yet many deaths occurred UK compared case numbers? wow death rate gets bad gets nursing homes E X P E D. W R S. charming Brooklyn accent. 
I love people immensely intelligent refuse change way speak. totally get going for, wow, place is... LOT, lol gonna say makes sense but... make sense.

Perfect time distract time (and years) getting fanfare around wearing mask... worked tbh. Ok troll. Show death chart looking proves wrong. look charts, know im wrong lord told you. conservative idiots New York flew Florida Asbestos good air filter right? Post Covid Syndrome? like ""Never Got Better Syndrome"" Sure, 70% maybe mid range, error bars matter. Damn I'm sorry hear that, hope he's okay  Thanks hard work, hope stay safe. It‚Äôs cute think true figure 1%, abysmal testing caught cases. previous estimates real number anywhere 5 20x reported number. pharma/insurance industry counting this. Sputnik news? could mean, situation Russia somewhat desperate - :(. Look positivity rate. No, states (the ones I've looked at), number tests periodically decrease, cases still remain high. Oh can't imagine hard would distance sick kid. time kids want cuddles hugs sick. 72 sheep one Welshman Well first place race USA USA USA Honestly think people going get covid people taken isolating seriously. tend think people taking everything seriously probably smarter therefore likely get vaccine. honestly think vaccine acceptance going higher people make out. Anti-vaxxer ignorance already gotten types sick. sounds like attempt beat India's vaccine speedrun record I'll hope best might possible fuck knows Florida world financial hurt. state income comes tourism. There‚Äôs probably realistic alternative implementing state income tax, maybe increasing sales tax property taxes 19% country voted Trump 2016. seriously doubt number *increased*, part supporters went voted. give people enough credit. need convince idiots racists change minds. need everyone else vote. Trailing double digits swing states I'd expect. Covid worsens, Trump look worse worse. Anyone rational thought part voting process already made mind. America shithole country. stop. endgame this. 

You either get virus spread control people keep dying. Things like hoping vaccine herd immunity fantasies. Looking good flu season then... Well bunch rich people realized get lot richer warping minds us peasants weird Stockholm syndrome situation think owe society near-slaves.

In return get crumbs healthcare insurance-leash.

Now get back work. Lol no. governors fault Texas fact many Texans love right wing media (refuse wear masks social distance). quarantine laid That‚Äôs heartbreaking tests antibodies NYC 56% 68%. likely, guaranteed, NYC immune major resurgence covid. using lagged data deaths extremely lagged.

This! daily death count always looks like headed past week two - incomplete data. wont listen claiming causal relationships. issue here. Often correlation vs causality thing people get right. case. claim discussed simply IQ correlated low showing correlation one single study far cry ""this 100% objective measured fact 

But **it study** topic here. said: misrepresentation study. 

...and started discussion. arguing against, claim guy misrepresent study. US population 330 mln.

EU population 447 mln.

EU/EEA + UK population 520 mln.

Europe population 750 mln. yes positivity rate jibber jabber far left liberal agenda. hate country much, leave! 

Honestly, would, one would take us now? envy guys ISS now. really do. Particularly last one left month ago. Lucky son gun! Oof scary  Dang, kinda looks like Lone Ranger. 60 times awesome meant say... ARIZONA #1! want glimmer hope, it‚Äôs Disney certainly capable company country. 

They‚Äôve already successfully opened parks pandemic without causing outbreaks. Maybe experience allow succeed. Trust know, there's god damn thing election. leader, nobody light fire ass, coherent plan going forward, average citizen watch disgust. We're sad beaten, given yet! *seriously* hope many Americans get sick smell ass, heads far up, start **wearing** fucking masks. also need consider positive rate. scenario,the positive rate declining least staying same. However, seen positive rate climbing. I‚Äôm Arizona, also healthcare worker busy hospital. tell 99% cases harmless. People getting sick it. people getting once. Covid-19 something we‚Äôve never seen before, it‚Äôs taken lightly. Please everything protect others. numbers? long Oh, plenty get it. mild them, reinforcing anti-mask ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu‚Äù mindset. serve magnify beliefs. Seems exception general rule, makes sense. Guidelines need followed sensibly. Ronazona better am. kicked establishment yesterday decided people wearing masks social distancing count high quality life public. yell humiliate front people save life, I'll it. even save life, people readily available deservingly abused, take advantage it. reason UK deaths high old people needed hospital treatment discharged back care homes. Tory policy. That's ""America"" building.. mention countries shitholes opened schools? Could find names looking examples confirmed bias? No, absurd post. Might well say Arizona many cases south pole.  Comparing apples oranges. Europe different stage pandemic. Arizona considering changing Ronazona. Learn straw man ha dumb cult start wearing them? No, Taiwan number one. US number 3 STILL!?!? WTF wrong state!? Total B.S.

Article states trials started three weeks ago goes state two groups. it‚Äôs possible Russia requires two phases, rest world would approve ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù. 

Nowhere state sizes groups. says nothing scientific outcome. Nothing see here. what's reasoning excluding major european countries others? Oh no, suck support staff! teachers kids' school young, nearly every para elderly. paras tend one one kids need close help. like help kid use bathroom bc high risk due age. continued wear mask infected, it‚Äôs quite possible sickened killed people. Blood hands.  healthcare provider still risk lives taking care dummies Recently, [study] published said masks reduce wearers risk 65%. daughter‚Äôs friend died week.......married last year, pregnant first baby. stroke. healthy 26 year old woman pre-existing conditions. People need open fucking eyes....it happen anyone. Lead rather make them?  Maybe it‚Äôs late that. 

It‚Äôs like reading another world hear reports states.  shopping 100% mask usage (not even nose visible, *was* bit unusual), hand sanitizer entry exit every store, social distancing, etc.  It‚Äôs like average teenager smarter innately responsible, they‚Äôre getting consistent leadership messaging. Suspiciously so, could say... America? southern/sun belt states?


NY northeast seem pretty well Hey! ^please ^stop ^rubbing ^it ^in good know. feeling little worried fast developed. actually point. point absurdity people proclaiming herd immunity. It‚Äôs cuz testing 

Just ignore pandemic started month later 

And fucked rollout tests, nobody even really got tested April. Yup,one way other, strive charts! 

We arrogant point think best whatever do, matter stupid, best greatest thing ever. 

This false pride disrespect going cause us much hurt bring us knees. lesson humility hope country learn. 

But, digress... Yes, COVID, doomed States.  Mine said even intend everyone work remotely 4 days week money they're saving. Easter!! policy sure reflect that. someone lives abroad lockdown, valid concern. argued guy reddit said comparing US whole Europe little nations big one like US, hope he's seeing now. Cases per day increase due high population idiots. comments basically ‚Äúand dems stop wearing masks Trump is‚Äù ridiculous. acting defiance, needs done survive this. 
I‚Äôm frustrated MONTHS I‚Äôve spent WFH alone three year old, hugs kids missed family, everything damn sacrifice that‚Äôs made nothing selfish mask babies refuse wear damn mask. look ""common sense"" laypeople analyzing scientific issues. Bro actually incredibly retarded it‚Äôs hilarious. figure represents overall cumulative number hospitalizations due coronavirus since outbreak. literally says link. Also you‚Äôre shit stats. pass class?

107.2 hospitalizations per 100,000 American citizens (this parameter restated page 10 cdc report)

328 million/100,000 = 3,280

107.2 * 3,280 = 351,616 total hospitalizations

351,616/3.29 million overall, cumulative covid-19 cases = 10.6% overall cases hospitalized I'm pretty sure read somewhere couple weeks ago whole Europe (or least most) stated accepting flights America, know true is, hopefully still fairly big problem live anyway, without American's coming spread further. 60 x greater bby read weep know what‚Äôs funny that? Reddit essential. I‚Äôm posting like is. real world keeps moving on. explain Florida's policy March covid positive nursing home residents sent hospitals require two negative tests coming back nursing home vs current policy keeps covid positive residents nursing homes / quickly returns nursing home despite testing positive?

Seems like dramatic step backwards Yeah, issues stem it: multi-generational households, need work, likely take public transportation, access healthcare.

Well one guy wearing mask last week happens next..

When asked reporters Monday, Trump deny ever wearing mask. reporter point clear indisputable evidence fact wear one. response he'll cut reporter citing ""That's nasty question"", discredit Network reporter works fake news, bring totally non-related topic (either deflection he's senile), move take softball question OANN. report mentioned study done check vaccine‚Äôs safety given humans successfully done.   

So deemed safe say effective all. said safety confirmed, means vaccines already market safe too.  

This seems like leap maybe bad translation. heard Melbourne, Australia region lockdown round 2. need start watching news again... I‚Äôm sorry crappy doctor. Mine said she‚Äôs pulling people work doesn‚Äôt want back school building. said she‚Äôs specially written notes nurses already. They‚Äôre idiots good heart, they‚Äôre intelligent vile, hateful, corrupt.  overwhelming majority anti-maskers conservatives whining freedom taken away US testing much! didnt test people would less cases! /s  feel bad employees. sympathy anyone visiting theme park this, even talk endlessly many precautions supposedly are. need antibodies immunity. cell response without them. millions cases many months, we'd know could get reinfected. right herd immunity virus disappears completely really possible without vaccine whole world getting virus people stay area regionalized immunity places virus spread easily enough drop cases New York levels. order put insanity perspective remember similar type behavior. Cigarettes generally come mind.

On every pack cigarettes US basically states going get chronic disease good chance going die it. Yet people completely ignore it.

I love folks quote ""Well know 90 year old smokes carton day"". Well yeah course. every one 100 others died horrible. painful death. 

How expect behavior something that's become political event? Disney open = muy freedom = can't happen me, does. what's control level viral load? seriously believe this, make sense use N95s (which rated 95% particle size smaller coronavirus) already 100% effective know much exposed give moment?

This partly professionals hesitant claim masks cure. People take information run wild non logical conclusions. sound incredibly privileged vaccine fading

That's fear mongering daily new cases percent positive fluctuated 500-800 .8-1.3% respectively since June 8th. we've held steady month, MDW, massive protests 4th July. hopeful continue trajectory. article vox, read Id say still same. Regarding matter makes difference masks effective not. still told Researched well understood, exemplified last statement Agreed. Science made one-patient anecdotes, regardless qualified doctor seems be.

It serve red flag, warning needs heavily researched. hard midst pandemic, though. much remains unknown particular virus every day see new symptoms effects.

This article bit disheartening, certainly final word. What's really staggering number 157 countries territories less total cases one state single day. Still news stimulus checks either. Fuck America, least pasty ass leaders stay home state go local theme park spend 5K family vacation? Lmao sure right injecting disinfectant Russians Vax Race. ‚ÄúWhat remember US like world combined‚Äù

- source probably  People need chill need stop many kids vaccine going ready October everyone knows ‚Äúconfirmed,‚Äù it? confuse US propensity cargo cult plans what's actually doable civilized, developed country. Using phrase ""Open smart"" sufficient.

Because half world shows wrong, including densest places. East Asia, Oceania, Baltic states.

Tell South Korea can't open smart virtually immunity. know South Carolina climbing hot spot, right? California desperately needs shutdown things get hand fast. Also ignores antibody generation disease via vaccine actually different.

This stupid point there's like 20 articles posted every day. isn‚Äôt nationwide looting rioting. large heterogenous state like Cali shut again. Regional variances people going Orange Riverside laxer restrictions I‚Äôll wait couple months vaccine Russia theory done, sadly could never done US. entitlement arrogance strong here; can‚Äôt even get people put piece fabric noses mouths without full meltdown. lockdowns led people assault rifles government buildings. Closed state borders would absolute chaos. sad truth is, don‚Äôt takes beat virus. Without terrible cost anyway. UV photons like gunshots virus that's exposed. another matter hiding behind glob mucous shade. great memory, really happy you, totally irrelevant thread article. Take somewhere else.

Send virology questions comments twiv@microbe.tv thank you. way I'm injecting Russian vaccine option North Korea's vaccine. testing means contact tracing either. try test everyone may contact new case two three cycles infections later get results. like there's infections Japan. think point Americans taking precautionary measures necessary prevent couple cases ballooning. So, maybe soldier civilian get - civilian spreads one two people realizing they're sick thanks safety measures, contact tracers get people spread further. soldier taking precautions, spreads dozen people also safe, there's much bigger problem.

If reports soldiers behaved true (ignoring guidelines, parties) huff definitely warranted.  Goofy bastards  4 5 day wait got tested Minnesota. Might go stupid easy here.

We‚Äôre sports, Oscars, vmas etc, though. Yea hopefully can. loved able finish school work like 2-3 hours able spend rest day want do. thing I‚Äôm worried football would work since I‚Äôm high schools football team bet thinks Auschwitz wonderful experiment too. forget incompetent corrupt leadership every level. mouse needs pay investors... usa officially retarded. usually takes 10-15 years fully develop vaccine. take less time covid-19 vaccine, highly doubt we'll one (that widely accessible) end 2020. Absolutely stunning lack brains Everyone posting agreeing, posting source. anyone source back show people information? shit Rt numbers estimates. expect virus publicly announce many people gonna infect result, current R value estimates byproduct assumptions result measurable data. 

Good job misleadingly quoting. applies current Rt estimates deaths data finalized. sentence nothing historical Rt estimates.

Deaths far best way measure Rt, albeit also least date one. caveat irrelevant we're talking 4 months ago. According CDC July 10, 40% infections asymptomatic.

Also fairly high percentage infections appear cause mild symptoms.

Testing people concerned COVID crap way getting idea actual extent infection community. Pretty easy compare that:

How many tests done? percent coming back positive?

Let's assume doctors everywhere ordering tests patients think need them. Since doctors aware resources infinite, threshold ""sick enough"" use decide whether particular individual tested.

The percentage tests coming back positive generally reflect region's average ""threshold"" - shows doctors think question, ""How sick sick enough vs tests currently available?""

In general terms, 10% people get tested testing positive, means 1 every 10 people tested positive. That's lot, considering similar early symptoms flu. General guidance says rate stay 5% - 1 every 20 people.

Florida Texas averaging around 20% last 7 days. week, 1 every 5 people received test results positive (important note people might receive results week test actually occurred).

Arizona beyond 25% - 1 every 4 people tested positive.

At national level, graphic depicts concept. Top left best: testing lowest positive results. right generally worse - higher positive results. dotted lines show comparable regions - anything line X% tests coming back positive.

There many nations right US, particularly developed nations. catching testing, testing catching situation worse. Texas says hi. know, suspect answer NO.

It also seems testing would reduce frequency things, prevent them. White House staff visitors get tested time, also test positive alarming frequency.

I can't speak every military base, plan one I'm basically follow footsteps state's governor. There's little concern soldiers' (or families') health, people routinely brought quarantine assist nonessential tasks, social distancing mask wearing heavily enforced, leadership constantly placing routine training higher priority welfare.

That's another component posted sub would met 'well researched entire bodies immune response'.

Based thread. TL;DR:

143 patients, hospitalized mean stay 13.5 days. 28 received form assisted ventilation.

They assessed mean 60 days onset symptoms:

* 12.6% free COVID-19‚Äìrelated symptom

* 32% 1 2 symptoms

* 55% 3 symptoms 

* 0 fever signs acute illness. 

* 44.1% worsened quality life

The notable persisting issues were:

* fatigue (53.1%)

* dyspnea (43.4%)

* joint pain, (27.3%) 

* chest pain study include lack information symptom history acute COVID-19 illness lack details symptom severity. Furthermore, single-center study relatively small number patients without control group patients discharged reasons. Patients community-acquired pneumonia also persistent symptoms, suggesting findings may exclusive COVID-19. put context, country (Canada) nearly double population Florida (Florida 21 million, Canada 38 - we're 1.8x bigger).

On worst day entire pandemic, Canada recorded 2,760 cases. think due reporting shenanigans too, *second* worst day 1,920 cases.

In fact, Florida's results (so far) *today* (15,300) approximately total **eight** worst days Canada (15,372), country - - 1.8x population state.

I (and do) wear mask public situations, need governmental societal perspective ensure ""essential workers"" protected.

Portraying COVID something totally avoid personal choices basically victim-blaming anyone catches it, even something essential (working, grocery shopping, childcare). fell like education. look Sweden highly educated thry herd mentality follow leaders. feel like people dumb education enough overcome it. That's facts seem indicate...or maybe something science behind COVID spreads. guess we'll never know. Agreed! this. god new yorkers insufferable. funny they're first ones call ""american exceptionalism"" pat back .2% state's population dying virus (and even higher city). good job guys, it, best. working, specifically problem.

However since things opened lockdown less people ordering delivery. lockdown earning equivalent 25$ hour $10. flight June 25. seems like really large time span people spread virus. doubled virus miraculously disappearing April... much, what‚Äôs there's lag reporting, means undercounting current death toll, accurate count months, maybe even years given shenanigans states going downplay pandemic. far I‚Äôm concerned he‚Äôs given little useful blunt information. sounds like reading newspaper article. Lots fluff adjectives, specifics. Uh disney kick violating mask policy. one person saw, saw Plenty pictures people cooperating Disney rules. trade anecdotes day Labor day Ikea new girlfriend? trouble feeling sorry people like them. hardly limited Reddit. Atlantic article month ago talking people month still can't go single flight stairs they're breath. Even major medical figures suffering extended symptoms. Think going see deaths decrease US done months ago. bad news is: greed wins. 

Do searches /r/soccer subreddit threads around March 2020 exact discussion there. Early on, government insisted work. that, people really took hold. mean, happens time American media.

Sandy Hook shooting, news mentions may second gunman woods suddenly entire conspiracy theories crafted 2nd gunman, never mind fact news corrected themselves.

It's 24 hour news cycle thirst answers drives this. Reading hard Well reading article kind get why, resemblance quality buzzfeed. Well, know second sociopath Trump According infection2020.com current fatality rate confirmed cases 4.25%

Would safe assume actual infection rate least 4 times higher confirmed?

This rhetorical. actually know. Every time someone says ask bother wearing seat belt. following traffic rules. Stop signs? Cross walks? needs em. it‚Äôs time it‚Äôs time, right? Lysogenic means latent phase viral cycle. Herpes viruses incorporate DNA DNA neuron (1% humans HSV-6 DNA) lysogenic also mean forming replicon (viral genomic structure similar plasmid) inside cell. That's Herpes Viruses do. Herpes Viruses definitely latent phases.  

Anyways, Coronavirus can't Retroviral Herpes-esque actions either, [+] RNA virus. refused services. harsh people maybe rest learn. We‚Äôve enough air blown bottoms politicians point... decided wrap up, know, protection. Why? Trump still getting killed polls. 

And everyone's confused people could dumb enough Disney, one seems pointing Disney shitty company numbers exploding. Fuck Disney. Oh right you. nuts. Yes. also, idea long term effects might children.

My guess someone wants knock work early.  course means today's announcement number infected actually measurement outbreak taken weeks ago. need moron tell us wear mask pandemic? Uh ok... Honestly! Pisses people ignore doctors continue life would pre-pandemic, calling virus hoax. get sick it‚Äôs ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs doctors?!‚Äù don‚Äôt deserve them.  wish 1% serious, dude dudette?

One thing modeling work past several months taught humility. pleasantly surprised see well flattening curve two months ago keep updating parameters account that. model pretty consistently pessimistic. Alas, I've also surprised (and dismayed) resistant reality large portion fellow citizens are, politicians certain bent also everyday people taken thing seriously.
I've astounded willful ignorance lack civic concern there.

So, I'll take opportunity repeat: relevant expertise developing nonlinear models fitting parameters interesting data sets using computer evolution. honestly idea what's going happen later summer except probably interesting. Smart man. Creating internet consequences too. could brought Age Enlightenment knowledge. Instead morons used bring age ignorance misinformation. I‚Äôm even sure best schooling could avoid fate. Florida, taking 10 days get results back. Useless Well good riddance. dare says things bad. Everyone knows things going great US leading world covid19. reason deaths cases increasing US best testing. /s love Trump country saw trump 2020 mask day YOLO = Yes, Orange Loser Obfuscates quite vision. definitive sources definitive observations reinfection higher credibility? TLDR: people assholes likely things good others society whole. It‚Äôs bullshit. making excuses shitty behaviour. expecting kind lame actually surprisingly adorable.  always knew masks good. simply lied public worried supplies medical workers. change mind.

You playing semantic games. r/theyknew Spoken like someone working help. ""message God"" means reflect implications event are. I've always seen message get shit together case wakeup call reform society various ways. lockdown protesters morons protesting rights feel violated, BLM protesters *not* morons protesting rights feel violated.

Hmm. Interesting.

I think Covid. Clearly you‚Äôre suffering fever induced delusions, breathing CO2 locked wearing mask day ill effects. Please, seek help. meantime, I‚Äôll pray you, child. completely agree, point trying make. Yeah. hope greatly slow growth come next year new leadership, vaccines, even current treatments now. Another reasons deaths high Italy NY early didn‚Äôt know anything. Lots people put Vents maybe wouldn‚Äôt new treatments new knowledge it. Plus understanding kills lungs. infects organs clots blood kinds issues. 

If get control leadership real chance limiting deaths cat bag. worried survive long lasting health issues future health issues haunt massive population numbers. worried long term economy world. need free healthcare universal basic income too. 

Let‚Äôs say 90% everyone gets infected 0.5% die. percentage 89.5% permanent damage lungs, brain, cardiovascular system? age. number afraid see, want see, hope low. 

The world changed.  Haha I'm saying wear mask. wear one tube, im saying Americans fucking retarded staging mass protests pandemic. new cases people protesting beginning-MId June average person meet, half dumber that. 

George Carlin. 1) Give deaths time catch and/ 2) Heath professionals know treat better. Meh, half infected brains begin anyway.  great, cant travel china coz stupid USA attitude toward covid Trump  bet 50 years possible US nation persistent cases. Maybe bit hyperbolic anyone fundamental knowledge hard reverse effects exponential growth anything knows put hole early it'll take much, much longer get self out.

It's rocket slow drift down. that, case numbers fudged one way another. People claim foul play, especially testing skewed testing flawed.

Can't argue dramatic increase deaths causes. keep saying well - really funny hear.

Wow thought washing hands touching face also implied cdc. argument wasn‚Äôt mask wearing problem, countries access cdc guidelines usa. that. good chunk California going end depressed home values. sudden important live close work even good commute route.  choice wear mask nothing politicians views statements. everything danger. People dying. want die responsible death another human being. get? Well, Korea Germany widespread testing (sort ""tests per million) certainly bump number up, seeing number tests many factors countries managing. onion belt? I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs style time... stupidity. least virus successful population control darwinism tracking.  Ironically, simply paying people stay home would likely better flattening growth better economy. Even though, still people cheating social distancing mask wearing (I've lot wrangling high-risk family members away unsafe behaviors... including medical doctors know better). What? Please elaborate. government failed proactively keep people safe.

Your geography fail you. inanimate. like cartoons roads personalities shit. agree upvoted quite ***articles*** posted articles' content/message important. Unfortunately share articles getting lower lower every day shit-talking Sweden twisted ""analyses"" comments.

And commentary OP delivers much much critical, seen discussions days ... blows mind there's actual people go..

*""Well COURSE cases per million like 10 times population blah blah""* understand cases *per million* even truly means. US Congress take hike. Clean backyard trying come ours. may think

1% people found posotive somehow needing tested.

that says nothing absolute exposure numbers, plus testing numbers. likely patients

once take account explain California‚Äôs, Delaware‚Äôs, Michigan‚Äôs Colorado‚Äôs spikes? Democrats? 

Your logic simple, must easy think like put chopped onions throughout house! Quick cure! 


Imagine quickcure^^tm myths said eat well exercise. 

As if.

BTW yeah, live apartment house suddenly fucking bowls chopped onions every corner stinking place protecting one anything fresh air. Eh, that's case here. Look hate bastard too, I‚Äôd rather people didn‚Äôt die. message god. Telling us donald dipshit shouldn‚Äôt charge anything. true all, go f off. pandemic handing blueprint defeating America war enemies. Biological attack. Wait thought heat kills virus /s Lessons ignore even get right now? hard enough before, connect Chicago Denver one thing. Americans really came MB North Dakotans Minnesotans Indeed. Like political rallies contribute covid protests...(because people agree causes rationalize safe.) reality is, neither smart pandemic.

Same protesting masks violate freedom. you. Masks protect others you.

If US singlemindedly wanted stop virus, could have...but many ppl think many different things.

Oh...and theres 100% blame goes politicians. response chaotic, need take responsibility control. Maybe going crowded beach Memorial Day terrible idea.

Sadly, this...you end seeing many lower intelligence people there. I'd venture sub intelligence people posting average. Especially mushroom head. God comment history cancer, subhuman level shit. men trash men women equal think means? You‚Äôre like broken record repeat saying repeating over. use words pretend isn‚Äôt racist. say immigrant implication mean ‚ÄúIllegal immigrant‚Äù real problem people breaking law, comes don‚Äôt actually care - always support legal frameworks elect people like Trump add even barriers legal immigration punishments migrants asylum seekers. everyone Arizona racist policies vote sure are. Yeah think role model thing important

If Mr. Rogers filming selfie alone living room he'd put mask, kids imitate see, humans tall kids, everyone feel better we're subject rules, even someone really need mask. People ignore conditions NYC presume experience busy city busy cities like. Even it‚Äôs half ridership, it‚Äôs amazing feat considering transit cars considered breeding ground spread. tend agree, overall Canadian response disappointing. BC things pretty well, probably could see difficulties Washington state having. lot Quebec's problems appear snowbirds returning USA. feds never clamped hard international travel monitoring people coming tracking make sure people stayed quarantine. best though cooperation federal, provincial city governments. worked together. 

Kind gobsmacked Australia locked Melbourne. Australian gaurds end jumping ladies quarantine? proud aussie moment. yeah nobodies going anywhere forseeable future. Hell yeah! ü§ò X doubt

Texas put 6 crews men moon ffs. know rest us shoes shirts feel. wish four years ago could call hysterical today, correct. Yep. Fuck Christians religion would rather live fairytales empiricism. 

No idea thought caused suffering perversion Christ‚Äôs teachings.

Fuck too. holocaust survivors 30s...

Edit: know I'm downvoted true statement, holocaust survivors 40s 30s... grandparents emigrated Germany US 30s Jewish escaping sure argument really coming Europe here, leader world. Yes large military economy. Nobody following you. I'm saying possible pointing politicians know shit crime spread Covid wear mask? 

Is crime unknowingly spread HIV, way deadly China Flu. paramedics took hospital recently wearing masks, staff visitors inside hospital. time see paramedics wearing outside hospital talking another pair. Probably far away.. care imagine Obamacare struck along preexisting condition protections. Free dumb

FTFY Ya - US trying pressure Canada reopening border. Irresponsible AF realise deaths issue ? It‚Äôs number new cases. That‚Äôs overwhelms system causes problems every sane country went lockdown avoid. 

Also think Florida / Texas / Georgia reporting true numbers deaths ... things would love sell you. 

The states biggest % pre conditions increase risks daily beat records new cases. stopping spread now. Unfortunately deaths follow. 

To put perspective deaths cause New York hot spots cut spread got relative control. 

But 2-3 times places gonna reach peak New York numbers week two states nowhere near New York ready it. 

I recon 2 -3 times deaths next 4 months last 4 months consider lucky.  Science social construct.  2 ways achieve herd immunity. hard way, large part population gets infected lot people die. easy way, people get vaccine people die. country seems okay working achieving hard/deadly way instead laying low there‚Äôs vaccine. Yes rather unspoken concern people every new strain could less deadly previous. personally like playing lotto...a strain similar SARS MERS could reek havoc. possibly know that? shows arrogance beyond belief. Gone summer. Dies heat. flu. part given! I‚Äôm curious ever admit fucked up. Arizona testing rate 60 times higher EU???? course number cases matters. That's need stop testing! /s Cuomo one worst leaders. forced senior homes talk Covid patients. sought cut Medicare crisis, even blocked federal funding. sounds good TV. compared many states like Washington, Ohio, Wisconsin awful That's terribly true. 

Since testing counting wide variety positive results, deaths hospitalization would paint better picture serious is. doesn‚Äôt kill makes stronger definitely think Dijon mustard.

I can't think reason aging, religious, white conservatives dislike upstanding black man.

Or maybe tan suit? FYI, Imperial College candidate, little behind Oxford one terms readiness. America testing more!

/s USA BAD

EUROPE GOOD

WE REDDIT. mean that's many countries EU doing.. Hoping vaccine fantasy, come. manage covid arrives. failure understanding much consume. probably would blow mind know much people spend stuff comes from. allowed. indoor dining bars open long Island Gah lockdown dark winter months hit different Without deaths though, kinda seems like, worrisome. supposed million deaths.  new face Karen. also run families auto repair shop. I'm curious use Facebook communicate? Ric Flair always line! Something shoot ain't real them. Legally? executive legislative agree something, nearly anything. executive alone? Probably yes.

The real questions are:

Can US legislature agree anything? Probably not.

Can US executive (read: Trump) accept reality, form coherent plan find competent people execute passing loyalty hurdles? Almost certainly not. I‚Äôm convincing anything, man. It‚Äôs clear wouldn‚Äôt possible. don‚Äôt know say concept family‚Äôs death suffering entertainment funny you. That‚Äôs sad. hope figure shit out, whatever may be. mean saying not? New Zealand highly centralized government. US literally union individually governed states almost every single state 2-3x many people New Zealand. 

Are dense? Bet upvote posts boy ten tho Something something something republicans acting bad faith ‚Äúthe rich therefore world well backs crisis thank much let‚Äôs see long help owners pillage country‚Äù sorted controversial found question top theory yes regulations haven‚Äôt written insurance hospitals different definitions covid hospital admittance admitted without preapproval get bill 200k Oooh, that's really interesting point considered. Makes wonder people used forced live near cities close jobs start fan suburbs. Could see lot people high salaries spend rent house payment move rural areas get 5x house size payment. That's reported people gone.  Rides wait times 25% normal. Yes. lucky slaves late stage capitalism choose death death. Thanks Disney!! statements political. Think it: gravity real. much dissention cause?

If reality fiction nothing real. I'm thinking since virus mutated several times, infect younger younger people. also probably different strain here. Right? Like Trump President richest, powerful, ""greatest"" nation world. possibly do? 

Coordinate fully national response? 

Use power federal government obtain critically needed supplies?

Provide unifying leadership compassion terrified nation?

Pffft! Crazy talk, know. countries sick shit move away dolla
Why bother manufacturing pollution print money buy stuff it? Maybe MBA program stop teaching infecting entire population virus good business. reduce number active infections zero, asymptomatic infections.

Then matter implementing protocols travelers, randomized testing essential workers, sewage testing surveil new outbreaks. We're doomed, count bottle caps today Everyone saying going die heat everything fine. Even thats somewhat true, often people Arizona actually spend heat? land air conditioning. know Americans buy exceptionalism, saying wildly delusional. Stay safe good luck eventual move. Yeah messaged sister said MAGA POTUS must inducted cult science.  demographic protested thousands , looted , burned property also responsible 50% violent crimes again? Yep, thought faith humanity pretty low already, nope seems like still optimistic. keeping real goes wrong. Yeah America wins again!! High score!  Whew! Oh wait what? Same! 45.73 times amount people died Covid 19 9/11. 14 states experienced Covid deaths 9/11‚Äôs total. 1 percent population Covid 19 retirement states getting hit worst right now. think August world ban imports travel US. also might see decline elderly population substantial generational shift. Yes sound worried elderly. worried you‚Äôre conspiracy theorizing. ""Years get vaccine""? 

Even Fauci said could ready early 2021. shit upvoted? herd immunity. antibodies drop half every 2 months. Tom Wolfe PA put measures place got SHIT know crowd. Why, next they'll want send kids back school! Oh wait...ugh. ICUs overwhelmed getting steeper. Survival fittest come...

Well actually *here go*. handled badly UK, certainly living world-leading reputation moment us well beat.

Good luck. actually speak DE. Idiots NJ, MD, PA, NY, VA decided hide DE beach houses completely ignoring self quarantine rules governor put place. top half state beaches fine.  Walter Reed Obama went ct scan Bush went MRI. Normal presidents worry perceived weak medical exam. RigHTs That's perfect response. Thanks, can't wait use next dipshit. Whenever someone says nonsense point pre 2020 pneumonia deaths per year Florida 200-250. 6000 died far year 'pneumonia'.

The deaths may actually 50% higher. Umm, without proper training gun safety skills danger child.    know guy seemingly chooses sound like idiot. live NY anytime mention well thankfully, goes ""FlOrIdA sTiLl lEsS tOtAl DeAthS uS"" Roughly 60% US overweight obese. I‚Äôd call preexisting condition, chief. many deaths? US 4% worlds population 

And 25% Covid cases.... Yeah somehow doubt country GDP smaller Texas somehow evil puppetmaster controlling downfall largest destructive empire history planet. collapse American baby Yeah, 28 million could evicted point year waiting money trickle down. Thanks, Reagan! see.

So:

Big Floyd protesters = virtuous couldn‚Äôt possibly spread virus

Lockdown protesters = morons murderers spread virus.


You might want adjust mask kiddo. bias showing. bad it‚Äôs muzzle. US rural states without city even size Peg yet harder hit MB.
So great job us, see sparce population us right thing. understand nurse might done it. shortage masks, want minimize use. mask gets wet/damp, starts losing effectiveness trapping particles.

I‚Äôd liken scenario you‚Äôre wearing seat belt you‚Äôre parked driving 5mph parking lot, seatbelt timer starts rotting away wear it. Luckily countries finding us, fine send kids back Stop posting anti-BLM anti-Antifa stuff. Well Trump wear mask military hospital DC yesterday. expect become regular thing him. Maybe one day he‚Äôll proclaim, ‚ÄúI never wearing masks prevent Covid.‚Äù end Trump‚Äôs voters around 35% population, need people wear masks ever hope rid country (and planet) virus. Simmer Mengele. well, fair...it sleep mask still!

improvement! emphasis police military education. also cult people literally worship Trump take word gospel. really weird, kind terrifying time American shocked know still decide lie.  Washington hit hard early spiking now. filtered pure projection showed one ""mandates easing"". [Full graph exactly point talking about. open up, needs data-driven. number new cases starts rise need put brakes. That's much Europe managed open still keeping numbers control.

The graph show happen open without reacting data (and we're seeing southern US states).

I think completely silly people wants open fast ""because economy"" also advocating high mask usage. obviously open faster everyone using masks. unfortunately lot countries Europe refuse that. Nothing currency backed biggest military world strongarmed oil producing countries sell dollars Great comment. still hope November.

Ya, see that. November 2022 see vaccinations widely available.

This thing going go years. able make progress President. Then, inertia system take another year deal with. Then, we'll need months get distribution set up. months get people actually take vaccine.

So ya, November 2022 seems fairly realistic.

Assuming get vaccine. Thanks Facebook allowing people organize. wish actual dancing involved. Another One Bites Dust might good song group. Idk spitballing here. think mistaken. sound muh freedom!!

(Just kidding, thanks info!) I'm trying say Covid nothing, AIDS. What's CFR untreated HIV? I'm thinking might merged single wave since never maintained first, case would ripple, big wave, ripple, over. Like tsunami? Exactly. I'm tired media portraying fiasco fault ""anti-science"" rednecks irresponsible, partying young people. Instead helping citizens unprecedented financial health crisis, US govt. choose throw trillions Wall Street. People already edge financially, without social safety net right every civilized country world, choice put hope best. airlines make much money! someone please think corporations once???

^\s Governors tried undermined president fomented insurrection called wholesale revolt certain states democratic governors. worry virus gone summer.  shit funny. one talking President except you. Yeah, brutal. lot people's true colors come light pandemic. IQ works culture highly values book learning formal education. also culture feel need manufacture bogeymen emphasise individualism responsibility family community. remember SARS. 

But they're struggling high population density. much everyone trying right thing, much easier disease spread everyone's living apartments using public transport. Wtf....who allowed that?   Opening schools going kill thousands including parents children. people fucking monsters. DW open who‚Äôve COVID. Vermont hawaii yeah sure. states nah dawg all, 1% covid-19 point last six months so, recovered, sadly die. agree it‚Äôs total disaster expect number active cases never higher, way would go Disneyland. however, it‚Äôs definitely going 1:100 people meet (right now). can't dig new hole? Saving comment, fianc√© never Disney wanted go year anniversary COVID happened. Honestly makes happy. obviously hate destroying country slap face supporters think wearing masks political statement. Perhaps sway wearing mask knows, maybe well save lives along way! like baby's first birthday something. give praise except ""About time."" idea hand, never even brought never got diagnosed wiith anything

EDIT: looked up, nope dont Uh, ICU beds full new cases occurring increasing rate actually really good justification move forward. always surprises people forget that. mean, protests ended Jim Crow laws, segregation laws, gave women rights, sorts civil rights things. Gen Z‚Äôers Millennials seem forget Boomers years they‚Äôve done last 6 weeks. 

On note, need keep mind Boomers remember measles mumps outbreaks, oldest may even remember polio outbreaks.

TBH, vocal people masks I‚Äôve observed Gen Xers. people supporting older Gen Zers younger Millennials. 

It‚Äôd interesting get overall generational study supporting isn‚Äôt. know there‚Äôs lot focus ‚ÄúKarens‚Äù, looking Karens you‚Äôll find Karens. honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs limited demographic. 

If figure out, target demographics PSAs. Hi could show duplicate post couldn‚Äôt find it, thanks! Ever heard pirating? It‚Äôs even easier paying stuff. Pirating video going see huge rise given state everyone‚Äôs income Balkanization content across 2,000 streaming services. history getting fans killed lax safety precautions  I'm sure Sturgis real shit show next month US here. ""cases"" separate people positive tests? people one positive test. Also still counting anyone one dies whatever happen test positive C-19 C-19 death? One part wants school reopen I'm good online classes part trying get corona guess I'll manage online classes. üòí know 2nd tall boy simply slow dumb idiot. hate people say shit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs lagging thoooo.‚Äù Like, it‚Äôs always lagging never is. agree you, amazes nation used say shit like.

Transcontinental Railroad, sure problem.

Panama Canal, get steam shovels boys.

Hoover Dam, that.

Man moon, got it.

Now sit couches watch Netflix, wear fucking masks. Nope, can‚Äôt done.

Amazing leadership, lack thereof, people. I‚Äôve never felt deep profound shame nation now. know look good. Spanish flu Excess deaths tell us number deaths (and even include people died of, say going hospital different illness). decently estimate total number cases need antibody tests random sample. Outside socially distanced w masks fine. It‚Äôs indoor attractions/rides id concerned about. Amen! hate social media (apart Reddit) well. Florida mayor improper. mayor Florida. again, I'm part 99%! YaY! :) Yeah...just wait today‚Äôs number goes last Saturday‚Äôs artificially low 4th July number comes 7 day average... wish every state I‚Äôm sure significant. course working memory gonna help use preventative measures. Ugh, it‚Äôs like trying get 5 year old eat veggies. Much death rate affected areas comes hospitals overrun. It‚Äôs likely deaths comparatively low happens (I realize heartless macabre sounds 500-1000 people dying everyday). Disney counting people following guidance.

Otherwise they're almost open Floridians. I‚Äôm guessing country. CDC certainly saying thing. People really going pop kids start getting sick dying wonder flovent inhaler help get covid 3/3 people section it, worried wearing masks other. that, follow guidelines. gonna say. bankrupt casino?! Must money laundering something like that. waited whole month restrict flights China, hardly Democrats fault.

Yep, didn‚Äôt enough restrictions wasn‚Äôt even actual travel ban, purely flights originating Wuhan (but went different country first). restriction joke. Doesn‚Äôt change fact rather pushing travel restrictions Democrats called racist, overreaction, etc. president late ‚Äúban‚Äù seemingly show instead anything substantial, Dems doubled stupidity try score political points election year. excuses administration ignoring problem Italy countries getting swamped.

Nope. even little. might want re-read posted put pitchfork away. wasn‚Äôt made try offer excuse. mention tweets urging protestors ""liberate"" states lockdowns. 

Yep, extremely stupid throwing fuel already blazing fire. is, folks still taken issue seriously largely blame anti-mask hysteria led pandemic lasting longer here. 

Who fuck even trying say to? even bothered check previous posts look karma breakdown immediately start assuming everything. requires competent leader capable bringing people together, trait know lacks.

Yeah...no shit. 265 posts former subreddit, know would still support him.

Yep, did. Quite ago. also voted 2016 (mostly spite vote vote nonetheless). None changes know jack shit me. 

I appreciate **know** still support him, despite true. Cool talk. article read, more...unclean felt. Like someone mentions lice, head starts itching. ya go!.....now wasn‚Äôt hard it? looks upset 99% 1% successfully recovered. also test much, report confirmed cases. time increased testing, surge ""new"" cases. wonder might be? Following Andy Slavitt‚Äôs regular updates. committee sidelined/corrupted sure. Soon president figures something getting vaccine favored people first, rapidly corrupted. know ego hurt. Stop weezing yogurt. Fauci needs go joe rogans media circuit daily 15 minute virus update Channel base I'm strict quarantine rules masks times. Poor basic training kids marching masks keeping safe, hope. base isnt screwing around virus. 1% 137k deaths US +100% hospital capacity pandemic yet.

Bulk up, 10+ million dead cards vaccine. #DEAR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP,
#PLEASE GO ,,l,,(-_-),,l,,.
#BEST REGARDS,
#MTBSRFUN specifically remove critical thinking curriculum feared children would learn think r/Infuriatingasfuck They‚Äôre making masks Coronavirus wearing masks? SMH Thank you, Dr. Mengele. According misattributed? One glasses handlebar mustache, doesn‚Äôt. respect Dr. Fauci. admitted lied worried supply medical Cornyn idiot. somehow manages look like thoughts, there's nothing there, ear ear. vote whichever dem gets nomination. hope best curious happen next weeks that. Anti-American according Trump Obama born America. People learning better way get involves actually giving fuck others. get virus stay home keep others getting sick sadly people work would customers. Except that‚Äôs coded. Plenty reasonable explanations increase pneumonia conspiracy theories. current case fatality rate(CFR) US 4.1%. assume IFR 0.68%, would yield 16.6% detected cases.

So based data, every person virus tested positive US, 5 people virus get tested. course, estimate nobody actually knows many people already COVID-19. Maybe read Girl Owned City thought nonfiction? We‚Äôre moving backwards. containing virus going cause untold death, untold chaos, untold economic damage. man needs new job. That's cash money Deadliest band ever! Basically right. Anyone tested actually count one really knew sure. early February got real sick gf. knew pandemic coming figured got flu boss work. never ever get flu though. feel strange think could Covid 100% sure crazy wide variety symptoms. part thinks hopes Covid cus would survived part hopes flu long lasting damage Covid cause..... getting flu kicked ass hard terrified Covid. Hope Covid lasting issues. Kids foster care potentially blame selves death loved ones. sad even think about. N95 mask would protect you.


But thanks poor planning general ineptitude, supply chain nightmare health agencies still lying us needing N95s that. work parent he'd easily figure get back on. boomers smart phones..they watch Fox clips youtube streaming services, sadly.  Weird question anyone keeping network news lately? I'd like general idea they're handling things right :) I'm PEI actually stop people coming here. Unless essential worker resident come.  We've reopened stages, first property owners second residence/cottage here, bubble provinces. outbreak guy trying come proper authorization local idiots tried bring over. Face it, implement jack squat, let Fauci take mic, wear mask look earnest saying vague platitudes ""staying in, staying safe"", interfere states' PPE orders, spend 99% time watching Netflix bed... Americans would've felt least fairly neutral towards him, begrudgingly sympathetic poor in-over-his-head fella trying lead huge country disaster.

He *actively* screwed country service profiteering interests rich puppet masters. hell...  Nein

But thank you. I'm sure fully agree. streets today, unfortunate pleasure seeing man wear mask chin cough. Immediately after, saw man spit floor. happened walking mask. cried inside. holding breath. 

At least supermarkets, everyone wearing mask. NY larger NYC dude thought. There's way decided wear mask, something happened basically fucked Obviously isolated incident, implications pretty terrifying. I'm hoping caught Chinese version European version people least short term immunity strain already caught, fluke. went summer two young kids. thing remember total lack shade. gyms safe use right ? Could put children huge hamster balls? See mouse pay price New Yorker here! Proud see city part. say today went friends, everyone walked face coverings people offering hand sanitizer front shops! Also standing street saw car coming would shrug say maybe time? Mexico always dug old buried bodies (I think limit 7 years) mummies Guanojato came from.  dug discovered mummified.  understand, family claim remains make room next body I'm sure left. I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôd go. Disney ain‚Äôt stupid. brand stake. It‚Äôs possible keep safe enough Florida standards. Ain‚Äôt saying much know ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è die still pay? means that, 4 people died, least 800 people must've gotten infected, least half asymptomatic hit news test, since symptoms. going get hand starts affecting countries safety. knows whats that.. dumpster fire band still business lol! Live - long YOLO Country seems like saying they'll treat pneumonia first since much urgent. would talk care providers they'll much info strangers reddit dont full picture. Fucking please, wont even fight stroke fragile ego continue wearing like, yup right completely wrong thanks setting example wearing masks.... current fatality rate healthy kids would put 6-8 dead kids son's high school. seems like enough reason even spreads parents. pretty sick math days. Eventually dozens deaths related high school. problem f'ed world fine? know many kids die school. Ok let's get carried away  Think it‚Äôs denial rationalizing ‚ÄúI-dun-wanna.‚Äù one become ill individual‚Äôs circle feel bulletproof. However, feeling bulletproof provide immunity.

  losing brain cells way, thus reducing cognitive capacity. CT I‚Äôve noticed similarly cavalier attitude: local FasMart 60% customers wore masks, worn hanging noses *clerks* wore masks all. plexiglass shields around, what? clerks enclosed space *all shift* people exhaling aerosolized virus right front them, gaps. don‚Äôt get it. data found actually appeared UK; right factors tied material situation affected race several ways throughout life. point lifestyle factors seem account half disparity mortality race. half could coming either genetic factors societal economic factor considered.

Materially speaking, black people group appear 4x prone fatal symptoms (IIRC UK article) fact intersect lot higher risk groups something think legally tie inadequate response. 
 
This Florida, might well disproportionalities coronavirus response caused preventable deaths black individuals; inadequate response constitute targeting group group higher risk. 
 
For record think governors investigated respective actions pandemic over, actual motives stated internal communications examined. Lol DeSantis Bootlicking fool, thinks moronic decisions cause anything devastation. I‚Äôm disappointed state sorry family‚Äôs loss young child. say I‚Äôm part wearing mask times, social distancing, staying home I‚Äôm work buying necessities. wish South Carolinians would same. It‚Äôs really much ask prevent much heartache. trick downvote it, upvote Children risk dying 0.000x percentage ‚ÄúTrump Flu‚Äù Imagine upset 130k deaths. /s Southern states aren‚Äôt sending infected patients nursing homes. Quite possibly egregious offense That‚Äôs lot people #HE DOESN‚ÄôT NEED MONEY KILLING BLACK BROWN PEOPLE LEGALLY HELPS CAUSE.

#TRUMP EVEN MADE ASIAN PEOPLE LOCAL THREAT.

#THINK BIG PICTURE; MONIES. beat Leukemia, beat Covid! good point. couple days ago, realized Trump esteemed leaders knew enhanced welfare would ending, grace periods credit cards rent would ending school would starting right time.

&amp;#x200B;

The man could totally put plan place April us focusing goal opening safely schools could open parents go back work. Cut crappy rhetoric politicizing virus put mask put plan place lead. hate Trump. truly do, would impressed this. Enough may voted him. bad nyc, Chicago, Minneapolis, dc seeing spikes massive protest. know seeing massive spikes states downplayed virus ones opened earlier ignored cdc. Art art. ok enjoy regardless. Wagner cunt still listen him. Lots examples that's easiest. mates him. miracle dude isn‚Äôt voted out, roof top! masks way indicate virtue others, signal smart everyone too! Win win! listen. ""We know things don't"" aka YouTube conspiracy theories 5000 died good news? Look South Korea's stat. South Korea didnt lockdown either. 1 death South Korea makes headline. feel like going one things gets walked back later, school starts kids start really getting again, like they've walked back many things common sense would tell true. (Like advised masks necessary...common sense told us made sense wear masks, turns out...yup, true.) 

Kids spread EVERYTHING. would different? studies showing ""might"" limited. summer camps daycares telling us otherwise. Common sense tells us otherwise. hope I'm wrong, mad am. makes SENSE me. contagious diseases kids can't spread? (Legit question would love know answer to.) see might affected virus, can't see can't spread it.  people could read they'd upset. boyfriend waited 2ish weeks. Edit: call go back urgent care person get results. Somehow 1% seems miniscule 1 100 feels like everytime I've gone grocery store probably passed someone crazy thought  Yep open them. They‚Äôll closed 2 months max go back school risk zero (hint: never zero)?? Sucks wait November 3rd/January 21st competent administration occupy White House. children held us hostage long enough, we've enough. Expect people like me, less masks.  Tests shit, try again, make sure Abbott think hmm, depends .. Corona yes Covid yes also. Sounds like plan me, I'll pencil UK. ü§¢ Yes, exactly. scary thing is, states nearing point already, example Arizona 90% ICU capacity many hospitals running beds. Christ, got lucky RGV, then.  

All local doctors I've seen news/social media have, March/April, calling shut-downs, masks, social distancing, etc., citing obese generally unhealthy population reason precautions.  

And today, 200 local doctors wrote letter governor asking reinstate shelter-in-place edict.

Meanwhile, churches still open (???). way get control change. need use pooling low-positivity samples first, enough time day return presumptive positive highest-positivity samples remaining day. 800 daycare centers, daycare workers get kids sources? 130k died. vaccine. patient Mao right reason wore get footage eventual attack ads.

I guarantee clip walking end one them, Ill double say probably slo mo. see, hard? People throughout north FL, Panhandle, central FL still wearing masks. still widely believed fake news, made-up conspiracy, mass media trying overdramatize it. Cases gone 1000% since Memorial Day county still people happily going &amp; socializing every day, distancing, masks :( Good, 99% go put behind us! There's reason Jackson favorite former president Water wet ü§Ø Oh one gold. Evidence suggest school risk level bar night club, known high risk activities. Show science sure make mistake lying. beginning seemed like controlled president. pandemic went could see becoming frustrated slipping away going along president. People need money who's hiring right now? great think ""Fuck place! I'm out!"" reality sets in. makes sense, 50ish years one really remembers anyway. Even Texas right threatening shut down, answer makes sense, try push masks people wear cases go go Economic Shut 2: Electric Boogaloo part 130k+ deaths good news you? (To put perspective, that‚Äôs 43 9/11s.) Angry Swedes incoming think it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúMr President, would look badass mask.‚Äù Yeah poll numbers.  No. link shows mask usage Country.

Western average probably 60 percent. 73 pro mask actually, don‚Äôt want pretend effective are. isn‚Äôt like go church wear mask. know, Amity means ""friendship."" Big baby makes poopy tbe potty ""With people aware hygiene before, hopefully viruses spread much."" 
LOL!!! guarantee filthy slobs before, still filthy slobs today. feel like even European Union works together better us states handling virus Yes, hope not. Kind polite? don‚Äôt care stereotypes. It‚Äôs like US didn‚Äôt themselves. fumbled ball, facing consequences. don‚Äôt want problem, ruin solution. Economically, entwined, socially politically. kind polite America America actually deals virus, like every country earth least tried do. Wait... brain damage count symptom? one supreme asshole.  wait open schools Attention Walmart shoppers, Disney open.  No, 'chance' surviving, estimate proportion infected die. 'chance' surviving governed many factors, importantly presence comorbidities(additional health complications) age. young, healthy person little risk dying, although deaths group many get seriously sick, old person several comorbidities far higher chance surviving COVID-19.

 part virus caused many deaths - healthy people even know virus yet easily infect people around them, example parents grandparents health complications, much higher chance getting seriously sick dying. case levels low there. point go back school then? never non zero risk going forward? Forget economy, many years put education hold? went times kid, rather taking away fun memories rides (except Back Future ride universal, Ill remember forever), memories Universal (in July) finding shelter one daily flash thunder storms... basically tropical storm 10 minutes, amount overheating experienced. 0/10, reluctantly bring future kids vacation. Herd immunity coming soon least...? everyone's culled... someone bragged someone know working major manufacturer masks sort big deal capacity claim masks offer protection coronavirus virus smaller gaps mask.

this person happy swiftly rebutted ignored appeal authority. ‚ÄúBut need another lockdown‚Äù 

Reddit full people don‚Äôt understand people aren‚Äôt going survive another lockdown Man joke much funnier 34,338th time. Thanks chiming in. actually optional. wear walking seat take off. means 600 people one room breathing air.  order test online gets shipped directly LabCorp free. insurance, test free link. I'm currently waiting results. friend's dad took test came back positive- confirmed test doctor well. there's least validity them. read article? literally spent 12 years exposing industry part Florida visiting? I‚Äôve seen people get shit *not* wearing one. Well they've dealing long time so.

Oh agree, give shit harm he's people, they're trying save face. Again, they've happy support every one evil policies far exactly would've done.

As fucked is, almost hope keeps getting worse gets better right I'm confident 90% Republicans would rejoice Trump removed Pence became president even though there's substantive difference them. amazing people could still support anyone party seeing power. 

This Ameri""c""a. What‚Äôs going on? Pretty clear hiding data  think it‚Äôs morbid hope Trump gets virus hope dies

Florida country, would rank fourth world new cases day behind United States, Brazil also broken New York State‚Äôs record 12,847 new cases April 10 epicenter U.S. outbreak. doctor, personal experience:

The symptoms hit waves, often never go away. worst symptoms month going hospital first time. developed pneumonia severe lung infection breathe. 5 weeks initial infection. Two days felt completely fine.

I believe got virus again, think damage virus never went away. point OP probably making somebody sent home thinking recovered, come back three weeks later even worse shape.  often going keep setting new records? delay test date results weeks, results meaningless. Better use money buying PPE everyone.

Good. reopen state. Yes. Arizonans born in-state.  We're killin mean Grandma died covid. mention amount test done almost double previous days. Still shows many cases aren‚Äôt confirmed Florida close getting things control. absolutely feel way; especially difficult living relatively rural area. Conservatives (of rural America largely consists) responsible turning political issue, reasons still can't understand. trying expose industry least 12 years so... many tests NY day compared FL?

Edit: NY 11,661 cases 26,869 tests (43% positive) 4/15. FL 15,300 cases 99,003 tests (15% positive).

Another stat: NY 888 deaths day, FL 45 today. Doctors getting much better treating disease. shit? Man someone hold kind international convention ban those. bet sister would 13500 wednesday.  Jesus........... 

On plus side, testing rate high good. Right? Right? Aren‚Äôt sundays typically low day too? I‚Äôve researched followed months. I‚Äôll say getting reactions many fighting stance ‚Äúthe flu worse COVID.‚Äù

There enough data points make determination side true. Especially released past days. googling you‚Äôll see doctors saying seeing. Multiple videos now, too.

[Disclaimer know, remember back March even 1,000 cases single day sounded astonishing scary. handful states regularly reporting 2,000+ day, country like 50,000+ daily basis, we're numb we're used it.   I‚Äôm Florida, haven‚Äôt seen yelling masks. I‚Äôve seen people get stink eye wearing one. [Anecdotal idiot. Grow up. happening, wait evictions start people forced back work UI benefits get slashed. Thanks! Today market, using bags checkout, cashier said, ""we're letting people put bags here"" (the bagging area) said ""oh yeah good idea"" bagged cart (which wiped antibacterial wipes going in.) 

I'll never understand people STUPID. God fucking coddled society. Thats gonna leave mark times
 
Nice wonderful experiment......and customers lab rats. hear ya. I‚Äôm CA well lived Florida 39 years. whole family back there. Honestly remove people life It‚Äôs complicated difficult understand I‚Äôve given zero indications don‚Äôt understand it. yet are, continuing add nothing conversation. 

In response someone basically telling untapped power *remove governor whenever want*, told don‚Äôt. Somehow caused think don‚Äôt understand voting works. inform he‚Äôs re-election, counter tell ‚Äúoh well, you‚Äôll wait then.‚Äù So...you‚Äôre saying don‚Äôt untapped power remove governor whenever want? Wow, thanks telling exact thing said first place.

Reading comprehension friend, understanding context friend. aren‚Äôt skilled those, end trying paint someone dumb without realizing **you‚Äôre agreeing everything say.** THIS! Mexico pay walk. Keep America isolated! Keep Mexico safe. 
It‚Äôs like planned way. Maybe sell back SW? Could pay weeks golf. main current outbreaks Washington cities never took serious begin with. large portion state listen govenor he's Democrat. It‚Äôs hard find right words. Inept good enough. Criminal strong enough. simply crime humanity. caught everyone guard. would Japan asking everyone time virus one even really known.

I'd note Taiwan contained really fucking well. SK pretty grat job too. Japan less perfect, per capita they're totally next level compared even Europe.

Now West systems place got lose, community transmission got completely hand last training run 100 years ago.

I actually suspect agree China let virus intentionally. choice self-quarantining basically driving HUGE amount outsourcing production China India, Africa, Philippines etc.... could let go out, keep everyone busy COVID start moving production China.

I even understand made decision, still dick move.


And that's kind thing. Chinese governments tends very, rational. see let out. see they'd let go wild population (and still fighting it, that's expats would absolutely notice). atleast they'll memory going disney mum &amp; dad...... 

one last time... EDIT: realize numbers one state mean 900 we've told about. Honestly, I'm sure obsession that's leading apparent ""rooting"" interest. much simpler. one ever paid one bit attention guys. people working limelight; grinding away job. sudden EVERYONE wants hear say. celebrities people interest first time existence. give dire warnings continue keep cameras them. Fear sells. FoxNews, CNN MSNBC literally built premise. 


This say virus dangerous. is. Fauci good job keeping us vigilant. guys find couple people brain damage kidney failure disease make proclamation makes seem like 30% people get this. get news. get interviews. leads people post social media. Everyone wants attention. Sunday results usually 7 day average. I've confronted gas station old man Star Valley wearing mask. got face berated wearing one. I've also problematic encounter Safeway Payson, father mocked idiot Home Depot. It‚Äôs worth noting peoples immune systems different. Even measles vaccine, tremendously successful giving lifelong immunity almost children, doesn‚Äôt protect 100 percent children vaccinate. Single anecdotes reinfection don‚Äôt tell us much duration immunity population general. zero coronavirus deaths last four days Scotland. literally cannot get lower. Who‚Äôs leader world then. It‚Äôs not. link video? Sucks us work internationally career, guess I'll figure go without work years.  probably still think joke. Stupid beyond comprehension. Equally appropriate would Goofy howl feel like hard grasp people.

60 times easy say really stop think staggering.

A guy work said could weld something ""10x fast"" me. laughed right face that's beyond laughable statement really think would take.

My welder set 500 inches per minute. wanted even attempt something *2x* fast would need welder run 1000 inches per minute. ones stop 700 In/m.

10x? 5000 In/m. I'm sure machine even exists runs fast lay weld would suck.

60x? *30000* in/m. would running keep instead moving hands.

60x amount cases genuinely staggering. hey coworker already sworn never get vaccine one ""he doesnt know what's it"". Fuck me, kid everyone else work guess. start reporting percent positive fucks sake? It'll 10,000 tomorrow less tests reported tomorrow get people saying ""that peak XD"". Florida reported tens thousands tests previous days - likely backlog getting cleared. I'm trying downplay bad situation Florida - bad - reporting cases, subject weekend effects, holiday effects, increases testing, totally inferior metric percent tests coming back positive. really difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

15.5% positive according another comment - atrocious, NY peak like 50% positive.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: NY state peaked 50%, NYC actually peaked 70%. It‚Äôs hard every state page. feeling going giant game ping pong. I'm Europe (the Netherlands specifically) way they've handled testing absolutely embarrassing. 

People feared infected told symptoms mild worth testing. people died seemed COVID-19 related causes counted tested beforehand. even today amount testing that's going means sufficient get accurate picture what's truly going on.

Some nations Europe (Germany) lot better us, yet many others lot worse. 


I know align desired narrative, things bad US headlines wish make seem. 

You're testing more, course report higher numbers. Numbers fairly meaningless comparing nations given chaotic nature what's happening, nonetheless, look COVID-19 fatalities per 1 million citizens US (with 418 per million) hardly different western nations (France 444, Sweden 550, Netherlands 337 per million). somehow miss armed group took two state capitols caused legislatures dismiss cancel session? feigning ignorance try diminish reality Trump encouraged happen actively called governors give armed groups? Meanwhile Florida... Wonderful experiment death maybe. rate we're going feels like lot people going high chance already contracting covid vaccine available. Executive orders power law essentially thing. Emergency powers legislation exist, state emergency called, governor power create law executive order within scope emergency powers legislation. really. Russia imploding thing too. Probably looked chart said starting kill supporters democrats now. Google read chart. Never mind.

Someone probably told that, showing chart.  common cold caused 200 viruses don‚Äôt get immune probably haven‚Äôt caught them.

The common coronavirus form OC43 I'm pretty sure children catch repeatedly. Lol. doesn‚Äôt even include July 4th cases yet. flattening lives, horizontally. wish corona star Yeah, live Arizona. know several people Covid. lot People stupid. number one Covid 49th education. Technically Herd Immunity reached Black Death, but, know... McConnell best pass law absolve businesses claims spreading COVID nationwide. Utah already passed one. going write one also waive organizing deliberately create conditions spread disease? surgical mask grade masks please Yes. testing. expect cases go up. Shocker huh? sit Rhode Island, 2 miles Station Nightclub 100 people died Great White's pyrotechnics set fire place wonder mind killing even fans. band much blood hands, unbelievably sickening want add more. need spend time memorial park victims drive daily. Arizona tested 1.7% population EU has, accounting multiple tests given individual. 

Arizona population:¬†7.279¬†million

Tests: 683,293

Percentage: 9.4% population: 446 million

Tests: 34.5 million

Percentage: 7.7% reason cases testing. Duh! /s  South Korea 150 cases like studied attributed viral shedding. scientists, job. Italy's worst days registered around 6.5k cases per day lockdown place. Meaning closed everything way getting number peaked shutdown. Even Florida goes full shutdown now, cases magically stop rising. 

If close everything now, expect see 25k cases per day peaking rate. speed urgency build field hospital manner days. Americas responsr complete disaster urgency, filled conspiracy theory, brainwashing dumbest 30% citizens also happen loudest ignorant Good thing average American isnt obese.

Oh wait, adult obesity rates 30% many states even least obese state (CO) adult obesity rate 23% I've sending daily messages extend deadline tighten border. isnt closed enough is. also want see federal mask mandate. easy wear mask hell we?  add together then... need research Faucis connections Bill Gates investment vaccines.

You can't trust them. Looks like post got removed mods. weird people take half second check source ties entire article together. author obviously spent time writing article I'm assuming there's *some* poll backs claim, obviously one linked. Sloppy editing best, straight deception push narrative worst. Coronavirus researcher Ben Neuman, professor Texas A&amp;M-Texarkana, said grown SARS-type viruses lab anyone else alive, served panel named coronavirus upending world. (Officially, it‚Äôs SARS-CoV-2.) He's science guy scientist.  end week, total accumulated cases US equal 10% Canada's total population. wait til Monday? Every Sunday grow wary Monday week ahead, due bad news Besides looking deaths take consideration alive permanently damaged people said best. Unfettered consumption defining characteristic. US: fortunate CSA longer part us. 

*...fuck* Ngl looks kinda baddass mask US overrun fucking idiots Except courts shut could months years remand waiting trial. That's EU without UK, think Screw you, buddy. late. damage done, way undo it. sold soul money, injured tons people process. Apology *not* accepted. Eh.. worst day NY 11,600 4/15, ~22,700 tests. NY capability 100k tests day number would‚Äôve substantially higher. 15.5% FL still missing cases, near many NY did.

That said, NY caught guard fast European strain spread vs we‚Äôd heard China saw Cali. strain FL appears contagious they‚Äôve 4 months prepare still got caught pants down.

Edit someone asked potential  welcome, UK. wingman. - USA nation world wearing mask partisan political issue. me, corporate videos like weird effect giant company leveraging human emotional cues trick brain thinking care specifically--when really care money. always leaves bad taste mouth.

This ad particular even stranger grimier we're middle pandemic really irresponsible--especially company could literally afford *anything* year still able pay employees get sorted out. ever met argued net played video games brit shock all, quite contrary. say ""yeah wonder survived far, guess inbreeding island safe"" America confused! hurt confusion!! think lot people forget part reason online classes last spring bad teachers professors had, many cases, little single weekend figure something out. well-designed online class happen fly like that.

My spouse taken many excellent online classes, college beyond. viable learning tool even fun. requires planning many cases, additional education support instructor. suspect districts universities squandered opportunity ramp summer put truly good online offerings. also hope I'm much mistaken. Fair enough, unless counting patient zero

It's totally fair compare total infections US total infections someplace analogous population- mind either way pretty clear screwed pooch disagree you, admit current leadership would require lot miracles. perfect world Donald Trump would resign somebody else step actually lead.

I mean, people would said impossible first time, find attitude kind self-defeating. states affected, people going personally know somoene gotten really sick died. start demanding action stop virus. one way stop it‚Äîyou stimulus lockdown. people going staying home anyway learn destructive virus be. 

All point Europe. got right first time. We're supposed richest country planet, suck get second try. need stop listening people say ""We can't afford it."" argument literally before‚ÄîIt's costly right thing. competent leadership sell it. Obviously stupid even talk to, willfully ignorant? testing almost 20K people attended protests Boston, [a small amount actually tested positive. why? people wearing masks staying safe. believe idiots Internet think death count one big conspiracy hospitals reporting every single death COVID-related they'll get money government. like call stupidity, quickly realize arguing stupid complete waste time. Trump I‚Äôm actually sick winning. tHEE LasT TiMe! UsA MucGH TsTing Here's thing.

All countries obligation provide people. Even lockdown.

But countries like spending money public services treat as, ""money object, let's whatever necessary."" Four, five max graduation? There‚Äôs still federal limits shit much money borrow federal loans time depends much you‚Äôre borrowing certain period time, need keep grades good academic standing university help. 

Edit: one decides go grad school still qualify extra amount federal loans/grants scholarships, grad school also different different fields it‚Äôs always necessary; scientific research, grad program really worth salt waives tuition grants stipend/fellowship exchange research/teaching/administrative duties student. hard say exactly split, estimates range 60:40 80:20. maybe selection bias. Research generally poor area various reasons include people confident misunderstanding, polluting data adding different concepts. Many physicians view basically physical symptoms depression, whatever means, feel perfectly justified pool depression together along various mood disorders, even though best share superficial features distance, definitely kind fool experts.

But generally speaking autoimmune diseases affect women men consistency higher prevalence, however unclear autoimmune pathogens tricks know yet. y‚Äôall don‚Äôt like cdc lol live Florida even I'm afraid go outside. I'm surprised record considering Florida, see almost everyone face mask stores. turns one person without face mask, really make huge difference increasing cases tested positive coronavirus. Yes, protests, numbers spiking Northeast like southern states... Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Texas, Mississippi...

That mean second wave coming Northeast, right stable like EU. help orange buffoon get reelected Wonder little back-log #s? Thats big jump day day. testing = fewer confirmed cases.

You think that, maybe, fewer sick people could also cause result?

Crazy thought, know. post doesn‚Äôt mention masks. ace cognitive test time too? use correct crayon stripes US Flag time? 
Story wabbit, blue crayon *union*, stripes! got I'm sure could survive again. think 60/40 favor survival. been. ""All"" includes him. recommended masks social distancing late January, 4 months ago. killing old people young people. lot young people population. found specific instance, specific place, something nation wide? Im arguing conspiracy theorist, incorrect science scares you. link non cro-magnon displeasure read tack on, countless statistics spike tracking, use base judgment protests spiked cases area, fucking asking people attended protest. reek scientific numeric illiteracy. would stop walking gas stations. lady showed symptoms friend live streamed situation settlers brought God systemic fearmongering Puritanism, delicious side Manifest Destiny fucking slavery. 

This America founded upon. 

Even ingrained stuff lies. They're wrong. U.S. entered WW II Pearl Harbor attacked Dec. 7, 1941. Fighting Europe ended May 8, 1945 Nazi Germany surrendered Pacific U.S. dropped atomic bombs months later Hiroshima Nagaski, August 6th 9th. Even ability understand new information changing stance unfathomable people. sensible, informed Americans give USA, there‚Äôs hope. best people organise fightback. Yeah I've tracking active cases countries since first March. US growth stalled early June things looking good. 4x active cases/capita. took 1st ot June nearly double per capita cases ours. crazy. mean, US, typical home tacky detached apartment tiny, almost useless ornamental 1/4 acre yard, next identical lots around, [endless middle-class boring  We're busy year-round now. Article NYT today Corpus Christi screwed bc everyone TX heard cases people thought safe. thing here, idiotic reason people think there's Covid here. Plus come party forget ""the real world.""

For me, 25k people live here, real world. Tourists respect understand that. aren‚Äôt people putting masks America? interfere constitutional right bear arms 5th Amendment? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è hardcore Christian denying virus causing this? 

Im Catholic, dont put science conflict phenomena observable world. Gregory Mendel actual Friar / Priest, Roger Bacon, ""grandfather"" scientific method itself.

And saying something message God prompts make necessary change life society, explaining causal mechanism behind it.  author said patient 2 negative tests, said know tests fail detect certain types cases drug game changer really worse ICU........ figured would skip right past 12000 one day week couple 11,400 past 10 days. Skipped right past 13k 14k too. 

Florida: ‚ÄúWe dumbest way possible. it‚Äôs easiest. take pride stupidity.‚Äù bothers me; death become statistic. Think second. 

I using LinkedIn day. HR Manager LinkedIn actually arguing infection rate important, death rate was. Human Resources Manager?!

The goal stop both. go hand hand.

He felt CDC reports low deaths, nothing wrong. problem CDC death data time processing lag. someone explained him, listen barrel roll around it. Wrong, 2 groups extremists trying defeat other. Anyone sensible would come together agree compromise greater good. She‚Äôs New Zealand 5 year exemption give employers protecting COVID related law suits make sure disappears pretty quickly. America would better they'd put fucking mask. There's literally problem except goobers wear mask help us prevent disease spreading. Stop trying make political. literally complex fact dumb childish wear mask. Arizonan here. government failed us really awful here. that‚Äôs happens former CEO Coldstone running state. masks mandated people idiots- it‚Äôs enforced people wear chin straps. Nothing enforced. Many dining restaurants, shopping, etc, like it‚Äôs different. Gyms ‚Äúclosed‚Äù many still open state they‚Äôre ‚Äúhealth clubs‚Äù. I‚Äôm pretty much self quarantining click list going grocery store. they‚Äôre pushing in-person classes schools starting August insane me. friend teaches middle school one kid could wipe teachers. coupled schools severely underfunded there‚Äôs teacher shortage. wish would cut dine asap. Tucson already ICU room shipping patients Phoenix, Cali, New Mexico. It‚Äôs also like set tents 110 outside. Phoenix hospitals morgues space they‚Äôre pulling refrigerated trucks.

TLDR: it‚Äôs bad, nothing enforced, we‚Äôre screwed. *holding back tears USA! USA! USA! maniacs need kept away every position power. Both. Obama also side effect culture. believe Trump backlash audacity electing black leader.

Pendulums swing progress never straight path. 

Name one American doesn‚Äôt think country issues. can‚Äôt agree issues are. That‚Äôs side effect 50 loosely coupled states 330 million individuals.

What culture exactly? see hundreds sub cultures myself. 

Covid still happening large way. wouldn‚Äôt place past tense far affect America long run. certainly affect next election cycle elections matter.

You say America isn‚Äôt changing? see change.

I get everything feels alarming loud antagonistic controversial that‚Äôs change looks like. 

I‚Äôd way horrified everyone quietly pacified. Yeah amount taxes pay average English person, that‚Äôs conversation another time. Please rely Biden administration fix issue. *help* bit, sure, problem American problem first foremost, Trump problem secondary factor. Reap sow. democratic country it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs fault vast majority see without mask young. Never forget ""racist boomers"" ones passed laws prohibiting discrimination 1960s. Oddly enough, since experienced it, also see much better air quality passed environmental protection laws. Yeah else USA gonna get sweet protection money? Yes actually. I‚Äôm denying coronavirus generally worse flu age range 18-29 fact. indication age group affected. 20 year old die flu lifelong complications coronavirus. According chart sent flu actually deadly towards 18-29 demographic facts CDC. 

Hundreds kids coming something result covid doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs harmful flu. specifically age demographic. data shows many tests taken average per one positive COVID case. US double average rate cases per test UK example. Yeah...that'll happen. think free-market solution like include mask 3 alcohol wipes large snack pack. Maybe get free wipes pay upcharge seat leg-room? people choose vaccine exists, I'm OK that.

It's fact taking ICU facilities mine might need *at moment* take issue with. safe want hurt that's fine. really choice. Sorry man, Canadians nice we're made be. main identity time seems ""Thank god USA!"". There's definitely bit superiority complex going on. Right pension teaching looking $600 month retire... could go $1200 teach another 20 years. Anecdotal, know. teachers better. actually look details subject spouting off? test rate matters hugely, fatality rate death count divided positive test number.
At start pandemic US, tiny fraction cases tested for. testing many times common. wear mask Nice try, wrong age thing. Arizona 15th youngest state median age. younger US average. Almost every state east Mississippi older median age AZ.

Arizona also median age younger virtually EU. Remember Hurricane Katrina message God, revealed God spared Bourbon Street, epicenter New Orleans party zone? new Babylon comparisons dropped pretty quickly.  couple friends nurses every weekend see Snapchat bar hopping partying big groups unmasked people. I‚Äôm obviously gonna like get fired anything allowed? Idk hospitals even allowed tell people outside work hours feel like nurses people keeping safe... Massachusetts low rate death infection currently put damn masks on. Weird many people Florida got ""pneumonia"" year died it. Thanks zero federal help either detect issue comprehensive guidance, NY allowed become America's breeding exporting ground covid-19. one arguing that.

A nationwide consistent strategy closing entire country reopening responsibly would prevented what's currently happening south. Also morons would actually wear masks. forget morons. Exactly, many people dumb? facts take like minutes find, they're lazy  Hello, neighbor. I‚Äôm Wisconsin suffer fate. Evers tried hardest doesn‚Äôt matter Republicans shout whine cry, stomping feet, making near impossible implement *any* mask regulations, aside MKE Madison. I‚Äôm central WI really seems like one gives fuck-no masks, bars, parties, everything is, part, back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù fuck everyone, ‚Äúno ones gonna make wear mask!‚Äù I‚Äôm petrified start school year. Preparations (e.g assigning Covid-19 non-Covid19 hospitals, recruiting 1000 housemen help public hospitals + training handle Covid patients) containment measures activated February, shifting mitigation MCO (no interstate/domestic travel, head household permitted get essentials etc). Zones high amount cases delegated Enhanced Movement Control Order (no one allowed leave homes, food essentials delivered door).

Thermal scanners checks, screening sanitizing stations, temperature checks set Feb. Businesses started shifting remote Feb well.

MCO lasted 3 months. head households essential workers allowed out. Even then, essential workers required proof employment (letter authorization company).

Violators fined, arrested charged. Covid19 misinformants also slapped court charges.

After cases flattened satisfactory point per health experts, slowly shifted Conditional MCO slight ease restrictions. recovery MCO businesses opened MUST adhere health guidelines. Failure comply option. public events mass gatherings still banned.

There also quarantine centers set up. Homeless set public halls tents optimized social distancing make sure they're protected. PPE shortage rectified Malaysians whole - local designers, volunteers etc. Czech. buy guns time goes, pandemics involvement decision need another one (yes :)) ) left believes right deny it. Keep mind folks racists. US vs mentality strong morons. feel like there‚Äôs bizarre underlying message discussions lockdowns worse people‚Äôs mental health uncontrolled outbreak.

That doesn‚Äôt make sense me. I‚Äôm emotionally unstable guess affected worse? Uncontrolled spread COVID-19. I‚Äôd take lockdown current scenario day. vaccine gets made mean 70% Americans take it. Since Abbott everything control, rejecting supplies border like good Republican. Return sender packages! Another thing people seemingly considering flu season months away too. going control coronavirus still spreading around well flu. deadly still put people ICUs hospital space dire conditions. small town hospitals capacity maybe 10 20 ICUs, maybe even less. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's real tragedy ourselves. US let people come wanted work death build railroads work mines. done slammed borders shut. Unless money goes without saying. comparison vs Trump, many people look good. Trump set bar low people think Cuomo good job PA mask order, made anyone claims ‚Äúmedical condition‚Äù exempt disclosure documentation needed there‚Äôs really enforceable mask order all.

And yet seems like population completely arms ‚Äútyranny‚Äù circling wagons around Tangerine Terror ever. Failed society thanks corrupt leaders think true rate infection 7x greater think information problem? C) Deaths happen weeks cases.

D) states deaths undercounting least half, delays time counted deaths start rise. 

E) Deaths risen 6% day (50% week) last week. Since virus always going grow exponentially, probably expect trend continue despite small sample size. Instructions unclear. Carrot nose lightbulb arse. God imagine breed Republicans WWII resources sent war effort things community get by? mean do...not sure getting many downs. 
Jealous bitches. mean enough people die curve would flatter time next month, it! /s great logic ‚Äúthe president control virus‚Äù...grow pair stop looking others save know hardcore Christians. believe this. try use science show illnesses virus say plague.

I given up. workers saying *years.* Here's saving spoons long gonna Trump company running stuff? clock hasn‚Äôt started out. aren‚Äôt listening science, politicizing everything. FL alone stupid. need seriously rethink electing keep alive. Seriously! Can't make mistakes people getting covid twice even 10 times. No. think WONDEFUL! OMG! good advice use it. :)

Personally, I'm shut drive.

It flavor concern trolling. starting find evidence Covid-19 leave lasting lung BRAIN DAMAGE!

Imagine US already comparatively poor ability reason think critically, saddled hundreds thousands brain damaged individuals. definitely fucked nursing homes, public messaging important time like this. spoken consistently responsibly months. Compare rhetoric Trump; impact. Im sorry way us acted. bad kids ruined field trip rest us. think condoms help?  die, do. Someone made point another thread undermined belief ""death lag."" observed test results lag too, sometimes amount. todays reported positives tested 10 days ago, deaths get reported occur, lag disappears. still expect sharp uptick deaths follow curve new infections, I'm less sure.

Edit add: Thanks posters answered, given concrete reasoning ""death lag denial"" nonsense. responded comment refer to, I'd quickly dismissed false. considering taking brief road trip wondering sounds risky. live Illinois, parents live New Jersey. considering meeting vacation home South Carolina. would drive separately, course, meet there. there, would probably outdoor dining once, otherwise would mostly stay property, except trips grocery store. considering breaking drive two days staying airbnb one night. would choose airbnb totally building (like guesthouse) interact anyone. think could work?

Christianity definitely [mental  Northeast protesting okay right now. saying protesting contribute, yeah, early opening economy main culprit. coupled people wearing masks. know statements incorrect largely remain correct: wearing mask protects others infected. not, time, understand much virus spreads now, beginning understand masks may confer protection 
) article CDC states N95 masks proven reduce transmission rate SARS virus ‚Äúshell‚Äù composed lipids, fats oils. However, amount fat oil tiny virus particles extremely low enough affect filter N-series respirator. Thus N-series respirators N-95 protect SARS exposure

 another article infectious disease expert, Jon Temte, states even cloth mask, imperfect, provide protection transmission ""On flip side, probably whole lot harm it,"" Temte tells WebMD. ""Any sort barrier reduce likelihood droplet transmission.""

So telling Fauci know science community knew back please, would like see evidence admission knew said anything science-based.

Did read article comment replied also acknowledged masks initially recommended general public first responders wouldn‚Äôt feel strain shortage explained public health experts ""were concerned public health community, many people saying this, concerned time personal protective equipment, including N95 masks surgical masks, short supply.‚Äù 

It say ""because know work."" says ""so first responder feel strain shortage right: medical workers need PPE already run N95 masks Amazon, etc.

Of course do, issue statement healthcare professionals needed PPE. issue national television told American Public need masks despite knowing did. issue singular statement helped breed distrust expert opinion pandemic US population. government mandating stock pulled retail shelves warehouses redirecting supply chains hospitals would much better idea lying. multiple Apocalyptic text variations found amongst Christian text Egypt, John Patmos' version chosen committee. Cultivated selfishness.

This looks like people selfish self centered long, empathy others atrophied near non-existence. Sorry go going through. 4 years ago lost father Renal cancer. often think mess would alive going COVID happening now.

I also wish anyone feel family families loved ones going this. hope disagreement loved ones decision wear masks social distance, continue things. agreed loved one lost, becomes wake call comply.

I don‚Äôt wish anyone. But...anyone willfully goes COVID parties mock reality, consequences actions.

It‚Äôs hard people right feel compassion people willingly themselves, loved ones, anyone public brave healthcare workers fighting front line. compassion missing chance save others. I, personally, reserve compassion people find position due wrongdoing will. 

It‚Äôs sad people die people learn listen doctors scientists idiots. Sometimes make bad decisions decisions cost others lives. time reassess positions make necessary corrections. Present! actual article found genuinely asymptomatic cases account 3.4% transmissions, sounds pretty rare me. got 50% adding number 48% presymptomatic cases, naturally high number sounds impressive make asymptomatic cases seem prevalent actually are.

Of course, none information excuse wear masks avoid mitigation measures. Even so, scientific facts misappropriated media circumstances. there's fucking way. Meanwhile crime murders surging like crazy there. Fair trade guess. trump doesn‚Äôt wear mask, libs complain. trump wears mask, libs complain. see exactly nobody gives fuck feelings exhale air, suck air vent super heat super cool blow back room inhale . Al gore absolutely hate idea Don‚Äôt obtuse. Poverty US contributes lack housing, multi-generational housing, lack healthcare access, underlying conditions, less access educational resources, need keep working outside home. factors raise one‚Äôs likelihood getting passing virus. Europeans bad testing literally notice dead people.

And course, best metric sufficient testing % positive tests. US % almost double EU one (8% vs 4%) Wrap boys. Literally every capable person planet earth trying figure novel virus guy says we‚Äôve reached herd immunity new york he‚Äôs nyc native folks taking public transit. 3 years ‚ÄúThe happiest place earth‚Äù We‚Äôll see..... dude germany fucktards admire trump. far right party AFD got like 10-15 percents votes. China accurate numbers. even revised upwards aftermath account people account previously

Never ever trust anything source that's either US us-allied intelligence agencies. always lie. Forgotten trump wore mask. realize bad NYC back April? exact situation policing. Maybe solution defund health care RemindMe! 6 months ""I'm biggest supporter Trump, support him."" getting frustrating honestly. people insistent looking strictly one part immune system calling day? can't really compare spread Europe US. Countries Europe made lot mistakes, still managed (eventually) lock efficiently start opening (slowly) numbers control. countries Europe opened constantly monitoring daily numbers, ready hit brakes necessary. Contrast much US opening policy-driven, rather data-driven. 

[UK compared [US masks one tools mitigation. I'm certainly pro-mask myself, everything else done properly (apparently) essential. country infection rates control certainly becomes important.

CNN's article pretty misleading. correctly says UK third worst hit fatalities, mostly peak months ago. contrasting death toll months ago actions today pretty misleading (UK ranked #28 new cases yesterday). death rate still really high though. track global apocalypse, hopeful would get second term. plans dashed! Yuuuuuuup. Red Wing, Minnesota. Hope military votes Biden. 

Hope realize trump danger oath took. stupidity gonna even dumb shit kill Americans next term. Make Wish program Disney temporarily suspended notice. far know, they‚Äôre still granting wishes, restrictions. Disney shut village though. think looks better on. tape stupid mouth shut Ted Cruz particular guilty hypocrisy. Deaths going go roof within next two weeks new cases pile up. Mortality rate 1-2% US currently registering 70k cases day :-/ Asian general (in opinion) fine masks. know fact helps protecting us virus, even normal time, viruses, bacteria, dust bad shit general. already wear mask time.

So govs would never need issue beatings mask protestors all. mean it'll easier us fully functioning brains get access whatever vaccine hopefully ends being? think girl one person. world get reinfected? judgin ^hehe wonder many thought hoax got it? Also: expectations Brazil extremely low.

US leader free world West, given west tends powerful institutions, expectation US actually well.

Now, everyone knew horrible president, expectation federalism institutions could kick actual crisis.

It disappointing.

Usain Bolts return race 100m hit 14.62. 

Yes, still faster overweight dude lane 2, certainly newsworthy. may case Darwin natural selection. People stupid wear mask weeded gene pool.

The one good thing remaining population smarter dumbass antimaskers gone. fine. think Arizona testing EU testing...? Good needs shrink alot tackle climate change us are, approval ratings show. 

If you‚Äôre tired winning, better vote, promise anti-mask brigade will. Yeah trump admin wants take away tax-exempt status federal funding schools don‚Äôt peddle propaganda. We‚Äôre living 1984. Yeah. really help. think Crohns IBS, found EPI sounds *exactly* like deal with. I'm researching bit more. one party digging fight due election year.

The reason looks like left fighting result election desperately trying remove cancer actively killing americans rhetoric. all. understand disease March able better treat prevent deaths. terrifying thing mountian presistant life altering issues recovered covid patients reporting still learning about. Severely reduced lung capacity, reduced cognitive capacity, severe clotting organs found autopsy, clotting happening surviving patients? ticking time bombs die aneurism? Frankly dont want one find out.

Also death numbers started creeping again. lagged 2-4 weeks behind infection stats get infected die later give time they're going go up. Winnie Poo closed wet markets long time ago. thing America really, truly, obviously, doesn‚Äôt want universal healthcare. did, they‚Äôd vote people willing give them. Instead voted Biden primaries. Even people likely vote universal healthcare US don‚Äôt vote majority. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Yeah don‚Äôt get chicken pox kid get shingles adult. Shingles way worse. hold richest country World little higher standard Brazil. figured much since Trump referring ""plague"" recently. biblical language certainly accidental. January/February

Anyone paying attention spreading China, knew would get eventually. political test. vote 5 days jail. know employer would either dock missed days I'd burn 5 vacation days. went Circle K work day womens unmasked kids jumping around kept bumping me.

Phoenix weird.  Yes, people report young woman wearing tank top. remind me, nov 4 2020 would compete hosts less deadly strain, would lose to. viruses tend mutate less lethal -- outcompete deadly versions. Yup literally cannot feel bad someone attends covid party dies, care sob story end. /r/conspiracy collectively losing shit  sounds like black Latino higher survivorship whites. want say I‚Äôm sorry even position make difficult choice others treat cavalierly. seem like intelligent person hope stay safe. 1. hit later 
2. Arizona far people studying indoors you.  It‚Äôs interesting thinks everything planned out, yet still required act. it‚Äôs planned out, anyone need anything? Help us how? Let‚Äôs trash Christians now. Wheeee. year online learning going make people behind year? secret ingredient.

Fun fact: titles reddit posts clicked find information! basically exponential almost like measures taken slow growth..........

dude, MASSIVE widespread protests U.S.

A section country (the left, politically speaking) completely fucking abandoned social distancing precautions progress made virus could go virtue signal streets little topic protested dozens times before, surely protested dozens times covid-19. 

Apparently large gatherings become super spreader events people involved feel virtuous morally justified.  ‚ÄúHAH! least free!‚Äù

/s  Cringe trump worse mask yesterday. could end best thing done fight covid. mask deniers figurehead anymore. Even Trump sees value mask yet many don't. initially thought June :( still hope November. don‚Äôt know well workplace last till next year. We‚Äôre barely holding on. 

My boss forced work weeks ago started reopening. second week client showed COVID. I‚Äôm back home although still admin assistants office think messed up. What‚Äôs stupid work completely done remotely. hate paperwork created system would work fully remotely. 

The business isn‚Äôt going great employees usually provide services people‚Äôs homes (that‚Äôs make money), we‚Äôre trying remotely worked first weeks it‚Äôs great longer we‚Äôve lockdown. No, one countreis extensive testing - Sort table ""tests per million"" see countries fudging numbers even looking virus (France stopped testing reporting couple weeks, one example). number deaths ""attributed coronavirus"" directly related whether coronavirus tested for! coronavirus testing = coronavirus deaths....

What exactly I've telling them. choose good person. Masks still mandated state. Maybe shouldn‚Äôt blame anyone leaders keeping us safe selfish assholes buying snake oil. Latino communities hardest hit they‚Äôre likely working dangerous essential jobs like meat processing plants. anything infected Mexico, let‚Äôs get straight. know virtually nothing medical stuff. seems make sense everyone saying absolutely case. Media asked line hallways, normally done type environment, get photos mask. Trump master distraction technique. many major political scandals soon followed ridiculous statements, top press conferences, controversial statements, etc. horrible is, guy knows he‚Äôs manipulating media. Man next time shoot text wtf getting coronavirus change someone's view effectiveness masks. effective, wearing one change anything thus correlation getting wearing mask. Moreover, anecdotal event (such one person getting infected) weight stochastic process infection spread. Yes, imagine emotional ""anti maskers"" swayed happens them, anyone doubts masks simply woeful lack evidence effectivity won't. even masks efficient, likely mainly limit spread carriers, protect wearer (unless talking N95 respirators), getting without mask proof anything. looks weak. ^tiny ^hands kind masks own/plan wearing mean, pretty much every politicians go thing since beginning democracy.

Distract one thing another.

Even Obama that.

It's people less obvious it. far know, no, would interested study; far know one done challenge studies re-exposing people already infected measure disease severity diseases.

We know Oxford vaccine research monkeys already antibody protection got infected anyways got ridiculously large doses virus, suggestive.

The latest New York data said going antibody prevelance, healthcare workers actually less infected average population, hopefully see real world data healthcare workers again. think way design study real world.

Maybe try asking scientific sister subreddit Weekly Question thread? money power? Duh. got info scared even him. Fuck.

Awesome. rest us info since March. Thanks response twitter everyone else. know reply bit snarky response makes sense. Human behavior relevant agree US goid percentage people behaving quite counterintuitively. Thanks effort I'll start yelling screen little bit quieter less anger. ü§£ Bane way competent is. matter time. Every single neighboring state many deaths per capita us (IA - 237/1 million, MN - 273, IL - 582, MI - 632, WI - 141). many anti-masker ""muh freedom"" Oompa Loompa fans red team enablers state legislature Supreme Court mean get partake ""fun"" we've missed since pandemic started.

7% confirmed cases come last 3 days. looks like ""herd immunity strategists"" may finally get wish rate. Jackasses. mean republicans decide murder liberals? Democrats don‚Äôt stones actually punish people. Bad genes  would made China. Like ties. Common sense matters Epedimiologists like Michael Osterholm Joe Rogan said 70% US catch they're already this, painting Fauci's comments March saying wear masks proof Democrats anti mask start.

While Fauci made comments shortage PPE medical workers Trump failed address... That‚Äôs true. delete comment. can‚Äôt let become public knowledge silver platter Joe Biden Arizona thing. serves food, bar. Also guy here, Reddit, tell sex essential, go &amp; get laid time. Can't live without it, may live it. Young people mostly already refuse wear masks point. see Trump wearing one going get worse. Easter eventually That‚Äôs great hear! sale now. remember reading Trump brand masks pre-Tulsa. assume mosquitos bite people Disney, catch diabetes die? That‚Äôs exactly it. Even president, Walter Reed isn‚Äôt gonna let walk around without mask. Even Sweden amusement parks closed currently plans opening year. Reddit. Thanks kind words friend. I‚Äôm hoping things get better well, I‚Äôm sure fellow Americans put aside pride greater good. Stay safe well! don‚Äôt think great grasp constitutes reverse-psychology. 3-4 months late.  newer thinking outdoor fine Summer. Indoor A/C Fall/Winter outside big risks. Chocolate?

It feels like though tested people would data points already, could make better decisions nation.

I wish enough resources test everyone possibly twice month. guess I'm trying comprehend testing already.  then, hospital earlier week testing, nurse told particular hospital coding anyone everyone could get away ""COVID-19 positive"" died, gave hospital higher payout. said observed cases patient came non-COVID condition, tested COVID came back negative, died, marked ""COVID positive"" anyway.

Seems like *much* incentive working level list deceased patients falsely *positive* list falsely *negative*. count hypothesis absolute truth. point forward, non-emergency situations, refer blood ""human sauce"".

7lbs would maximum amount body fat 500lb 6'6 man could lose week without exercise, OP's friend lighter shorter that, would lose even less fat.

That said, factor ""water weight"" - definitely drop quite fast start eating less calorific needs body burns glycogen stores. People go water fast often drop several lbs within first couple days this. I've never encountered someone lost 40+lbs water weight week, max 5-10 weight loss expected fat loss common.

OH get two scoops ice cream everyone else gets ONE! Take that! Neener Neener! One *Hu*man Sauce; Man Sauce. give people context, I‚Äôm Texas. uneven shut COVID started hitting hard early on, something helped slow down. Around started opening back fully around Memorial Day, like 10th 8th infected state. Currently, we‚Äôre 3rd Florida isn‚Äôt far behind us.

It wasn‚Äôt like 2 3 weeks ago Governor finally decided implement mandatory mask order (before, left individual mayors wanted implement one city). But, area least, there‚Äôs still ton idiots following that. past 8 days, Dallas alone exceed 1,000+ new cases *everyday* deadliest week record far. Governor threatening another shut mask mandate isn‚Äôt followed, also know doesn‚Äôt want that, doesn‚Äôt actual plan combating this. Oh, school starting back next month too. People money fair better without? knew? mean states done it. kids getting tested summer camp? people getting tested going back work? sports tested even peak tests weren‚Äôt widely available. people get tested states increase testing capacity?

Like saiid. Every single person NYS access tests free. holy crap. finally took advise team

I'm shock predicted presidency, death. image circulating never Simpsons episode. Honestly mayor tried closing disney, governor would probably go head keep open It'll nice break cousins heard guy named Anthony cares shitty golfer put closet try stop talking it. surprised, I'm north AZ, still getting lot tourists job. Half still wearing masks. Really bad news, hints CFIDS associated Myalgic encephalomyelitis caused RNA virus, maybe ignored CFIDS long quacks like chinese conspiracy theorist, that's it, one, look like one.

You're it. ?. dont see big deal is, impending hurricanes cool things down. emergency visit six months ago seems gone straight memory hole. wearing gloves? Coronavirus seep skin.

It's whether die survive Covid infection, often damage affect long term health Quality Life (QoL). overlooked simply saying IFR and/or CFR going enough.

 

On top that, deaths (and infections) rise. hit hard opened yet. do, virus spread. huge problem. Police need wearing masks. good sign, country's sake, hopefully blind followers follow him. Though many months late... people protesting dumb? think Spanish flu decent example. need lots deaths though. they‚Äôre stupid, got it. :) Yup. hold country higher standards Brazil India.

I understand trump held extremely low standards. feel like people would sick wasn‚Äôt saying anything negate said. stating question. Well explains protests guess... Maryland need adopt implement good public policy would re-elected landslide can‚Äôt make it! idiot. think dumber. definitely less emotional IQ, directly impacting willingness considerate people. Tuscaloosa man also 78 year diabetic, according article. words, exactly kind person likely die infection, mask not.

This sub loves kind fear mongering. people get it. December ? it‚Äôs longer available ? /s

Nice title.. Sounds right.. We‚Äôll see schools shut positive tests period dont think we‚Äôll see kids die quite quickly, referring depressing. can't find image includes meeting.

[I find image week wearing making personal decision wear mask.

Let point likely infectious June 30 meeting. Indoors. Air conditioned. Prolonged exposure. many people think infected still wearing mask? Democrat mayor, governor city/state mandated masks. fact, mayor could refused. say Republicans ones blood hands pal. saying old af probably problem.... Huh Fox lying coulda sworn Millennial Generation killing folks. Well guess Gen really suck... Imagine  ? I‚Äôm worried above. Kids *still* die too. one kid dying state wants open schools many already. Downtown disney. Disneyland. Again. get Phd? teachers start dying significant numbers really educational crisis. think Americans gotten stir crazy, Americans exactly psychologically stable bunch start with. qualifications take seriously literal? rhetorical question.

What? That's barely coherent sentence. devolving talking nonsense. guess rhetorical meaningless possible provide answer expert something understand voice opinion.

You don't, understanding lacking even standards layman, never mind scientist. right share opinion, obligation. would still better everyone don't. We're already dealing unprecedented spread misinformation, lack trust scientific method many problems. Overly simplistic fear mongering makes worse. Seems like 1% always screwing rest us. Almost 18,000 pediatric cases today. Luckily immune system rely presence antibodies only. Look memory cells function. it‚Äôs generally agreed IQ (which highly debated) depends equally nature nurture.

According 80% intelligence adulthood inherited. 

So, thing nurture lot parents (who gave genes well). important peer group. peer group highly educated families education valued, likely value education well, means ""nerd"" work hard grades school everyone circle friends well. vice versa. friend circle composed gang members, unlikely effort school much appreciated there. 

Neither one anything school fundings. thing school funding able make poor area school good, start attracting families areas (good school children probably number one criterium educated families choose live). push prices drive poor families. So, never able reach equilibrium poor people would able get kids best schools (that is, let market economy decide housing. plant block council houses middle upper class neighborhood, maybe, that's going politically really hard). think it‚Äôs pretty intuitive quality education extremely important developing critical thinking skill.

Well, I'd say would great that's schools taught. generally neither good bad schools teach that. rather teach memorise facts that's get good scores take university. 

The funny thing particular case, think critically, health officials say. look totalitarian country Vietnam. They've done incredibly well covid-19 (370 cases, 0 deaths). country trust people make decisions, USA, that's badly. Case = positive COVID-19 test

Infection = anyone received virus, whether got tested not.

There's general consensus far infections confirmed cases COVID-19. testing improved, pick higher proportion total infections tests, including many mild cases, still many virus without taking test. Better sorry safe open schools (that's expression goes right?). 8 weeks locking worlds strongest economy 370+ million people... isn‚Äôt going happen. Cmon now, realistic. 

We aren‚Äôt equipped anything scale, regardless magic wand want big daddy government wave. news, water wet. Nobody listens follows through. America incapable anything like that.

The German company Biontech, working Pfizer develop vaccine coronavirus, confident able apply approval end year. Even then, around 300 million vaccine doses could produced one billion end 2021, Biontech co-founder CEO Ugur Sahin told ""Wall Street Journal"".


Biontech, originally specialized treatment cancer, one 17 companies worldwide started human trials vaccine Covid-19. Mainz-based company uses experimental technology known RNA mRNA messengers.



In initial tests USA, volunteers already developed effective antibodies Sars-CoV-2 pathogen, Biontech Pfizer announced Wednesday. still unclear whether antibodies actually protect infection Sars-CoV-2. clarified phase 3 study 30,000 people participate.



Subject approval authorities, Biontech expects Phase 3 study begin end July completed end year. study successful, company plans apply approval vaccine regulatory authorities worldwide.


The partnership Pfizer USA international companies Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical China enable company quickly produce large quantities vaccine doses global market. Biontech also testing potential vaccines Germany. first company Germany receive approval Paul Ehrlich Institute.


Nevertheless, Sahin dampened expectations placed vaccine. Even several vaccines available time, could take ten years worldwide immunity Sars-Cov-2 achieved. ""I expect virus 90 percent world's population immunized infection vaccine,"" Sahin said.

Compared US, way worse. deaths per capita worst world iirc 2x worse US. still nobody wearing masks unlike US least good % people wearing them.

Stop talking ass. scientific source confirmed this.  hospital Houston

Let's put perspective. Houston home Texas Medical Center, **largest medical center world** 21 hospitals two-square-mile hospitals Houston (many located TMC locations, like Memorial City) reported turning away ambulances. people still sick March.

I know one people confirm true. Still can't breath like could February. believe it. know 4 people including tested negative. Testing crapshoot, even get one. Germans under-report cases (by 30%) according historical death statistics, pot calling kettle black. Plenty lies go around. Facebook pretty toxic environment.  certain types disputes relationship immediately call couple‚Äôs compatibility question Higher numbers think harder comprehend. One case, ten cases, hundred, everyone takes notice. Now, 50k, 60k, 70k daily cases? many count lot people. France people encouraged take greater precautions public transport indoor areas lots people like shopping centers.

Its rare see people without mask public transport people also make effort maintain social distancing public transport. sadly common see people wearing masks incorrectly however.

Some people wear masks shops dont. Mask wearing shops pretty much followed government said safe children go school without mask shops didnt need limit amount customers shop. less half people wearing masks supermarkets far tell.

Almost noone wears mask walking street open air locations parks. 

I guess see soon enough mistake people interpreting government regulations. government given diffferent messages people would reacted differently. dont think giving fuck although surely motivated that. want good too. make difficult roll schadenfreude: nahnyanahnahnahn. also they're communist hubs indoctrinate children. commander chief? actually. powers mostly fucked Last Saturday US recorded 265 deaths.
This Saturday US recorded 722 deaths (so far). Buckle folks. week gonna awful. forget go Disney first! used anti-maskers try prove masks nothing. Penis puppetry? get idea. Stupidity global phenomenon though. US struggling exceptionally hard pandemic, we've already passed 3 million cases. Please tell Trump, starting take seriously. pool parties immunity playing part. There's lot resistance built city. Europeans brought loads diseases new world decimated native populations. population Americans fell 90% Europeans came. protests went nearly-total adherence mask-wearing.

Also, study show pretty conclusively protests effect COVID-19 spikes: Ask shall difficult find.

I suggest getting KN-95 available close N95. Ohhhh, think stopped him.

I there, I'm told president small company work wore Trump mask state finally allowed back office. mother (59, believe numbers) said gets dies maybe time go. dumbest shit I've ever heard. infected child child died? lived husband died? Would still feel alright it? sounds modern. Back March basically impossible tested. feel rather likely know was. Wtf, seriously? That‚Äôs nonsense Oh agree kids absolutely need socialization. Prior child entering pre-K play dates friends kids age toddler soccer,and arts &amp; crafts camp. made sure read early age. 
Childcare evolved too,into educational experience rather babysitter. daycare professionals degrees Early Education, result,children better prepared school.
I also mention Head Start program,which lifesaver many low income families. states provide programs infants well toddlers statistics show children attend Head Start prepared school. work wear masks, put 16 us small room meeting twice month, I'm Arizona. kidding, wish was. feel pain. he'll go powder room touch orange face....lmao That's 1% around national average.

Therefore, IFR used things like modeling predictions future deaths different scenarios.

Case Fatality Rate (CFR) confirmed cases divided deaths, 'detected cases fatality rate'. CFR useful analyzing good testing prevalent virus particular area/population, well comparing viral outbreaks. would get tested immediately can. thing happened tested positive. boss asked tell anyone worked with, tell. serious too. time take get tested receive results? congrats Seriously don‚Äôt know long term sequelae virus.  kids getting sick could long term health issues. don‚Äôt think case Minnesota. governor taken lot flack opening things sooner, part cases risen less neighboring states positivity rate remained lower too. We‚Äôve outbreaks traced back bar patrons last couple weeks. past week we‚Äôve tested people daily even free sites protests. think account 4 day test result turn around 800+ positive today makes sense. think points start increase cases, seems inevitable. 13 sailors tested positive twice. study inherently political. results inherently political. examined intelligence people comply mask-wearing orders intelligence people comply. line divides two groups happens line line divides political spectrum, that's fault study exactly America badly COVID-19, everyone busy fighting tribe,

The reason America badly COVID-19 people wearing masks complying social distancing guidelines. countries well followed guidelines. One ""tribe"" America well, one ""tribe"" didn't. fault mask-wearing group. fault group refused listen. Title kind misleading, half cases closed now. 

Still fucking dumpster fire though. Trump straight said would lose fair election, that's want vote-by-mail? Idk that....it would take LOT people die Texas California (think big populations are) match something like Connecticut. possible pretty big feat match 3 weeks. Massachusetts. scary thing though, NY + peak, actually enforced lockdown sent lot college students home among measures. + wearing mask social distancing current states getting hit hard like TX, FL, etc. still staying open, planning reopen schools hell, Disney opened recently FL. honestly, states slightly higher percentage people willing wear masks Even decide lockdown tonight, things really bleak least month many states. doubt mind South + West actually get hit lot worse NY back March/April. scary thought really bad around back April especially.

There many countries (with much less resources) dealing better US (practically everyone single one except Brazil) see people moaning China caused pandemic, China faking numbers.

Only god damn Americans try blame China every single second ignore (or seem ignore) criminal mishandling pandemic great government.

And getting like 150 cases day mask bylaws coming effect cities. really doubt slight bump multiple reasons.

* northeast majorty-cooled window AC units instead central air. usually blasting day

* windows-open weather 80s, sweltering heat keeping southerners in

* Mask wearing followed well northeast, especially initial breakout

* Governments enforcing rules businesses strictly

THIS FUCKING ONCOLOGY CENTER. And, accurately predicted redditor week ago, already started ""I never masks"" gaslighting. phishing scams work. 

They bank fact confused elderly people likely trust complete stranger asking send thousands dollars overseas, instead family tells they‚Äôre lied to. Utah, prefer encourage people right thing rather issuing mandates demanding compliance,‚Äù said Wilson, R-Kaysville.

Adams, R-Layton, added he‚Äôs asking residents ‚Äúhelp wearing mask voluntarily.‚Äù""

Wishful thinking.... Honestly it‚Äôs like people suffering Stockholm Syndrome Doomscrolling news websites day I‚Äôm happy mask mandate. haven‚Äôt actually anywhere yet see it‚Äôs followed though. Goods news saw study claimed need 7 minutes close contact spread enough virus transmit it. Probably another study published disprove though. think well many plastic barriers lot hypochondriacs. Hope region keeps good work ! vaccine would approved public use, manufactured large quantities, deployed wide scale, take time show really preventing vaccinated people getting virus. There's less 4 months go till election. really see happen short time. sources claims pulling info ass? 1 ‚Üí2‚Üí4‚Üí8‚Üí16‚Üí32‚Üí64‚Üí **100**

Guess idiot fucking right gets way. Dragged everyone kicking screaming em, know somehow china scapegoat finally admit real dangerous virus. Oh, BLM protests. Hopefully less stupid people wear mask bc this. mean step forward guess. One world‚Äôs travelled-to, overcrowded city subway, without culture mask wearing bowing greet instead handshakes, like crowded cities Asia.

Other things may done wrong, geographical reasons played part. Sadly, I'm French less less people wearing masks (except train mandatory), also people think virus hoax, conspiracy sell vaccines.. really hope vocal minority Oh absolutely. Diet Poverty real, food economy set make healthier food expensive. real barrier indisputable. Nevermind poverty line set 3-times cost food, 50 years ago, food economy set people spent - guessed - third income food instead ~10-15 percent today.

Oof rode big green weenie 8 years. fact home take care 8-* does? didnt really last long tbh ""wide portion population"", well dont think really anything wearing mask. people forced bankruptcy told couldnt open business, told couldnt arbitrary things like buy carpet seeds garden lol

But concerned people getting large groups pandemic, I'd think BLM youd look. Like, Utah day called national guard. still protesting despite major spikes covid around entire country. I'm sure theres lockdown protests still, let's honest.. arent even close largely wide spread BLM, waving flag around.

At end day, want say protesting pandemic bad, defend one ideology other. punches hole right logic  seeing ever happening would work? saying Trump could ballot switched fake one? media's fault, understanding disease evolved real time (hence called novel coronavirus, first time encountered particular virus) reported known time, however members right wing also deliberate attempts skew news evidence, example persuading people mask wearing infringes freedoms. get local epidemic, virus threat blown proportion * insert government goals * since America history operations within outside borders.

But come on, whole world it? Even countries hate America America claims threat free world? Like North Korea, China, Russia, Iran, countries ""stans"" behind names etc. 

Don't think would love take golden lifetime opportunity make America embarrass world stage hoax? come automation, cloud services, government stimulus surging prices essential goods/service like healthcare push inflation up. far common one drive inflation. Yes constitution freedom travel states average joe get cell test then? widely available yet? Wherever buddy too.

I lot say hanging ageing dad 3 months isolation household I've deleted response you, put short, I'm fucking proud country aimed eradication close get rather merely keeping hospitals within capacity. Finally

The US's strategy lack thereof finally work F\* FAA Sec. Transportation Trump mandating masks worn plane? would actually promote flying again. Many people - good reason - afraid flay again. first time, since pre-COVID took flight Hou Chi. majority people masks boarding exiting plane, vast majority took masks flight including guy two seats front coughing brains sans mask.

Flight attendants cant really force passengers wear masks unless federal mandate. Trump Elaine Chao need get asses jobs keep passing buck. much youve travelled though. learning school. Learning different countries operate different ways. history affected art, music literature throughout years. learned great philosophers different ideas society be. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôll probably worse New York. literally everything slippery slope people. believe give even tiniest amount ""freedom"" forced wear something, 5 years we'll microchipped gulags.

Obviously kinds issues logic that's think. I‚Äôm sorry. personally know two people affected similarly you. still can‚Äôt believe many dummies aren‚Äôt taking seriously. Yes, Japan Italy kind studies also saw ""real"" infection rate around 10x official one.

As said - still lot things know. CDC guessimate best guess moment.

And least, _far_ aligned death rates see elsewhere. Wrong. media focused Trump impeachment til early Feb. Mayor Bloomberg entering Democrat election February. Media didn‚Äôt cover coronavirus March. Damn coronavirus lot organizing cash.  even hospital? it‚Äôs big deal then, right? 1% equal every virus. forget dick sizes too. Uff, Sorry. reddit coffee next time. asked brain teaser interview lol. answered 15 didn‚Äôt stop melting down. may never know. looking help image re-election trail. 
Everything related campaign and/or finances. 
I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs hiding taxes 

A. doesn‚Äôt pay taxes

Or 

B. broke China owns shit idea wrote - trying understand perspective questions, want know thinking might valid informative insight, you‚Äôve failed every point elaborate initial comment. Lame haha Thats say, everyone get sick survivors get herd immunity. it‚Äôs going get worse, it‚Äôll 10-12 day mark. ""Only"" 1,683,000 currently infected tho tbf saw pic dubya bush tank though. Surprised Florida numbers economy shut everyone working home. They‚Äôd MUCH higher hadn‚Äôt. sit fuck down. people really want go New York summer? I‚Äôd expect Newsomes dumbass west coast say dumb shit like this. ‚ÄúWe well flatten people state make rise again.‚Äù miscreants always scapegoat *NEVER* take responsibility. job people coming state mess up. It‚Äôs juvenile excuse. I‚Äôm going need sauce Wow. located? report them? messed up. What‚Äôs wrong people?!?! still can‚Äôt believe groups people feel comfortable gathering right now. road fuckers going need change identities want live normal lives.  mean, right band name Jesus people morons. get wrong, sympathise families people unwittingly go infect 'covid parties'...but individuals attend parties go fuck deserve sympathy still believing hoax. Leopard surprised face eaten part leopard eating faces party look like anything relevant Shit thought TX democracy, idea hand electing Abbott consenting continued rule mock much he'll stop, cultists need see fall line Dude, sorry. sucks. Like, cancer sucks. morons suck too. surrounded both. I‚Äôm sending good thoughts. hopefully uptick mask wearing vicinity. completely agree you. I‚Äôm located Monterey peninsula California. worrying part this: someone called cops officers literally arrived left minute. didn‚Äôt shut maybe left warning. 

My guess told couldn‚Äôt party long time??? I‚Äôm sure happened surprise, stopped around 8:30pm. early types parties. 

I suppose someone neighborhood got tired family throwing multiple parties. Since COVID started, they‚Äôve thrown 5 parties. averaging around 100 people. think could disproportinate due psychological element well.  Walking around seeing everyone masks constant visual reminder things like physically distance hand washing. business went bankrupt instead money allocated oversight disbanded money went pockets connected people, mega churches, large corporations dont even pay taxes. blame lockdowns, wassnt. countries managed strict lockdowns without loss business like here. Corruption businesses closing. Period. 

Also one decidedly keeps bringing BLM conversation. talking dumb shits think facing tyranny wearing mask. want see real oppression maybe actually listen stories BLM movment. two seperate issues entirely dont understand getting that. *It's small world all...* People: Politicians greedy idiots lie time. Everyone knows can't trust say. 
Also people: Medical professionals claim coronavirus deadly, politicians saying safe, must true. problem kids school means parents work. Parents work means income. income means food, roof, clothes, nothing.

The USA cant afford pay everyone. country can. UK im betting massive tax rises way.

The USA screwed theres high population government pay people, plus political wings left right adamant wear mask, go normal protest. done messed A-Aron. Newsom, time act. No, thought [Kai data backing up, Florida hositpal worker interviewed day said 67% asymptomatic people chest scans showed level damage lungs even though felt fine.

How many checked, checked people unknown.

No way know permanent though. Yes would. people think ‚Äúdirty‚Äù people get STDS ‚Äúgod punishing gays AIDS.‚Äù

Read people behaved AIDS crisis. president refuse speak going on. History repeating itself. news like vaccine far away, really finding less less reason keep going on. Presdient really, REALLY like John McCain. want care exhausting nobody anything I'm looking point Yeah England virus still rampant. Scottish Welsh governments handling much better. Well, hush money form payment, no? disappointed. fan podcast beginning. hate break opening everything back still getting 500 1000 cases day going eradication. way numbers going back up. It‚Äôs crazy whole thing popped nowhere. Imagine many lifes could‚Äôve saved america gotten early waring things come. Back in...I dunno...march? sure said, case people aware: military base military hospital, wear mask. military bases USA certain health level risk code level right they're in. know many, military bases, especially areas high COVID cases, require anyone living on, working at, visiting military base wear mask. Military members also required wear even base. warranty expired version USA longer supports updates Could been, never got checked - parents wouldn‚Äôt gone doctor anyways. deal things ourselves. 

We play outside lot could‚Äôve that. I‚Äôve poison ivy times could count, tailbone thing different. 

The body weird... US troops put harm's way deliberately irresponsible actions leadership state. much Repugnicans 'supporting troops'. Here‚Äôs tip. put fake exterminator notice neighbors door mine. paid exterminator act like works apartment building exterminated unit neighbors.  help? Nope! It‚Äôs years building burned 5yrs ago, way get rid nasty critters. wore better? Biden vs Trump edition.

One looked like ninja looked like neck pouch turkey lookin motherfucker. Wow....So glad wedding supposed photograph August rescheduled next year! Problem is, US right little unity, basically impossible US things drastic changing constitution. there, done that, sure. ;-) ‚ÄúWe take amount normalcy amount joy get,‚Äù Jose Villanueva said rested shade Tomorrowland wife, Kacie. ‚ÄúI know people upset wear mask fireworks. us, feel lucky here. first thing made us feel like could leave house still feel safe.‚Äù

Why?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Disney,‚Äù Ms. Villanueva said.‚Äú

People desperate distraction. news full Covid, it‚Äôs talked everywhere see it‚Äôs impact step door (even areas fewer people adhere guidelines/rules). human perspective understandable, even though personally would try look elsewhere find distraction (tend garden one, dirty meaningless sex day, start knitting, knew...)

People also trust Disney. Again, stories documented facts Disney holy company sometimes made be, general people connect lot positive things them, characters stories.

This it‚Äôs Disney‚Äòs responsibility look it‚Äôs fans. means shutting (again). Even I‚Äòd trusted Disney‚Äôs plans bullet proof (which don‚Äôt), doesn‚Äôt take genius figure population still debating whether face masks constitutional not, way, shape form able adhere guidance rules coming anywhere.

As much possible outcome sickens really really really hope somehow miraculously manage contain risk, also hope able connect every single case Disney directly, blood hands. hospital told coming otherwise. Bet. knows hell going man's head. doubt emotional reaction someone close made wear mask. strategic decision felt would benefit from. May ask what's hallmark symptom Chronic Fatigue Syndrome constant tiredness difficulty concentrating? \^\^ This, want first take it. I'd rather stay locked house another 2 months. eager. could one people survive permanent lung damage. 100% lock would contained 2 week theory. would new cases that. 50% lock stop it, slow down. like 20% lock down. Absolutely not, poor unemployed people ignored right now. makes mask wearing uncomfortable. Good.  sad, major news outlets lying, covering manipulating ""news"" years.

""what cost lies""

I think virus real, think lied long made people conspiracy theorists think that's absolutely fair do. think discredit media must discredit everything seen worth eyes.

The state world bad way can't trust anything media tells us they've lied much words empty.

Scary times. sure mask would made much difference someone like that. amazon for! Stay strong! Made China One reporters part-owner I'm preschool teacher went back six weeks ago definitely fear went day sole purpose getting nachos. Guess what? nachos Slurpees.

Exactly. Date night home park picnic maybe - restaurant. open mean safe. think left 0 off. likely. make excuse wore one.

 high number partially due transition new reporting system, prevented processing positive cases hours Thursday. cases included today‚Äôs case count.

OHA Daily Report - Cambridge here. lockdown happened, town dead, honestly never seen anything like it. I'd also never seen many Joggers life. People seemed taking seriously. checking ""number cases area"" stat every day, honestly, area never got dangerous levels. think factor. see elderly people wearing masks see them, know vulnerable people sheltering, think people preparing wave never came starting feel normal going business. hope still aware, even BLM protest socially distant vast majority masks Much 147/148 backlog several days earlier, earliest March. Yesterday date reported, prefer check date death graphs/charts instead. England still rather higher home nations though. logic quite simple: children tend present symptoms, therefore tend te vectors.

It common viruses affect children much adults (or ways disparately affect age groups). Chicken pox example.

Children need distanced adults (teachers, etc.), eachother.

Here couple english language research sources corroborating existence magic don‚Äôt disagree anything said.

Although, doubt boss legal responsibility let sit home.

But something lawyers courts, goes far. already made choice could helped pay people's mortgages, chose stock market saving lives. another shutdown unless Trump losses they've made bed lay hope vaccine comes soon virus becomes less lethal. cunt May ask symptom CFS? SARS 1 version MERS, especially since mutation. mention it‚Äôs binding ability ACE2 receptor.

That's has. shown stable 33 Celsius (91.4 Fahrenheit) would room temperature. virus doesn‚Äôt show much degradation 37 Celsius (98.6 Fahrenheit).

...

The virus normally replicates 37C. human viruses capable stable temperature that's assembled at.

You clearly know anything virology. both?


...because both. May ask symptom CFS? It‚Äôs coronavirus it‚Äôs probably moreso going go route common cold. Weaker strains still propagate every year due genetic drift. Good times Yea, Case Fatality Rate horrible metric dependent testing capacity tells little nothing disease. 10% people test positive die, 60% people tested disease, tells need testing more.

I actually find useful estimate infection fatality rate use total deaths infer total infrctions. seems gone roughly 0.75% worldwide. people US infected members group.  Serious question regards reopening Disney World. Could park lead potential cases park safe? I'm definitely going vaccine made. Italy, Spain France countries lost control COVID transmission since regained control. hard lockdowns, testing contact tracing. possible regain control lost. narrative incorrect.

The cost contact tracing largely human resources. many people work provide source income many currently unemployed. funds given supporting initiatives rather supporting large industries would possible. would involve alot training, investment disciplined effort achieve. Governments reluctant woule require immense amount effort. Damn 1% hogging Coronavirus rest us struggle without. realize ""Roll Crimson Tide"" means wave deaths south COVID-19 low-IQ/stubborn people wear masks. everything said ... friend talk believes shit. Thank you, kind. cousin month week May. early 40's. miserable time, survived. aunt AZ got it, 60 years old, sick, survived. husband, 58, died within two weeks. family California took seriously beginning. 

It's likely first death family. Looking next year, I'm sure I'll lose more. Stay safe, everyone. not? 
Most countries brought virus handful instances, example West Central Europe. US, Russia, Brazil countries screwed up. WM counts based different timezone (GMT) cutoff 8-9pm EST  field hospital Riverside closed. plans reopen? still said report black people without masks hotline. know can't answer one. answer get canceled. test look active infection antibodies? screens active infection, would make sense. got it, brought home, got it, it. real then? Suddenly I'm very, thankful mom read child. never thought twice it, really took Harry Potter fantasy books readily elementary school. even though stopped reading much high school college, graduating, picked like nobody's business. I'll thank tomorrow :)

Thank showing taken granted! Thanks taking time respond!  ducked sick bayonets? I've customers get hostile employees wearing masks.....like enough people deeply, deeply concerning. leaving comment check back later see well ""no purely political content"" rule enforced nowadays racist? It‚Äôs sad quickly judge women less pigmentation, based color skin.

You self reflect, eat less fats, try stop breathing peoples personal space. That‚Äôs give COVID. 

Not obesity, though. That‚Äôs people themselves, sadly. That‚Äôs eat less fats.

P.S. want pic I‚Äôm cool sending closeups balls, butthole. tell want first sweetheart.

Oh stop racist. Disgusting behavior. That‚Äôs simply true. New Zealand took completely different approach U.S. targeted testing, track trace, early lockdowns etc..etc.. ‚Äòsurge‚Äô people entering country. (We know effective testing). New Zealander‚Äôs weren‚Äôt given false information, given clear instructions, effective prime minister meant citizens didn‚Äôt spread virus themselves. That‚Äôs people U.S. could do, guess wearing masks socially distancing hurts freedoms. [there reason I'd say need go outside while, idiot-in-chief made unsafe so, guess get keep swallowing propaganda like mindless moron are. unwillingness say ""I wrong."" know use fast passes feel this. diagnosed college celiac sleeping least 12 hours day. bit free time would sleep - fatigue intense first years. wonder percentage shut Karen Fair enough, said I'm proud country aiming eradication seemed like talking England. Usually weekend numbers tend underreport well. Meh put military hospital. basically used flag pin. I'll impressed makes habit. absolutely not. look, even quick Google, Michigan, example, lousy stories people leaving hospital 60 90 days. Teachers Arizona still testing positive 45 days symptoms began. often takes three weeks symptoms become bad enough someone even seek treatment. live MI catch it, 31st day positive test symptom onset, either recovered dead. between. ventilator? Nope, recovered. sick move? Recovered. multi-systemic organ failure, hoping nurse able get family Facetime late? Nope, 30 days, recovered.  


That sounded bit ranty, no, honestly, 3-4 weeks nowhere near recovered large number people. point envy Mexico You‚Äôre close, rich people two spots low. indicate it‚Äôs rich people, ones running government. Yea. shit! Canada deaths California less people California Newsom fan back March/April disappointed, feel safer CA Newsom would states. Newsom declares mandatory masks states haven‚Äôt. Newsom gave pressure reopen parts states soon, increase couldn‚Äôt blame that. People stupid. It‚Äôs getting hot AC going on, people thinking everything better starts gathering again. don‚Äôt forget protests. government making sure can't sue it, hospitals even businesses. all, want anyone take responsibility this. ""We known would happen"" say, scuttling away lights come on. interestingly enough, saying sarcasm still helps perpetuate conspiracy kids really ones put danger. many people hospitalized causes? Yup outcome reported measured, f everything else. anyone ever federal assistance natural disaster? bud. blame like big boy fuck up.
I'm saying understate alienation. lied you, every day, 20 years, would trust damn word said?

If yes, clinically insane seek professional support. cover whole body camo mask &amp; cover deer piss 8 hours bastards cant wear GD mask store?

Government. Can‚Äôt afford assistance either, cut back many people starve homeless. Rising crimes even bigger threat affects age group. 

Failing another shutdown push country desperation mode. virus still spreading devastated economy. 10x harder come back choosing ignore approach. sucks scary, however impact second shutdown easily scarier, let alone super high chance fail cause even catastrophic issues top virus problem. work store. beat ass. Nazis pro science least lol Yes! let‚Äôs take it!! Best thing done far entire term!!! He‚Äôs learning!!! Yippeee!! Ok terrorism? feels like terrorism. BREAKING:

No.. school. would bet kid 10-1 setting, aka 1 provider 10 kids room 11 bodies sharing one small space minimum, ive worked daycares ran 2-20 3-25. would actually pretty hot take campaigning base lol. marketing master here. saw one, believe called ""Jaws"" that, Mayor de Blasio wanted quarantine city stop spread, Cuomo said would override decision, allowed NYC residents travel Long Island upstate spread virus throughout that, Reddit users obviously don‚Äôt live New York circlejerking day amazing Cuomo bashing Trump TV daily televised updates idea actual poor decisions governor. Donald Trump greedy, corrupt asshole, Andrew Cuomo. makes decisions vote counts money mind that‚Äôs literally all. ‚ÄúCity people won‚Äôt want vote next time make quarantine city can‚Äôt travel wherever want? I‚Äôll make sure whatever want.‚Äù I'm diagnosed fibro. Afraid catching covid. then? Fibromyalgia Ultra?? stories sad. People dying hundreds thousands throughout world China never apologized. ammount americans prison. 3 days later:

Trump: ""I always promoted masks sanitizers. Since day 1 Coronavirus. lying media says stopped people using masks, also say oooo Donald Trump germophobe. Thats call Fake News"" Whoa, like take.

Yea, sorry reddit, know want more. dont need new thread every single day complaining people covering mouth means 'literally nothing' HEY something least. JRE fan, disheartened Joe‚Äôs opinions covid. huge following could influence lot people wear masks social distance literally save lives. instead buying covid tests test guests podcast nurses doctors denied tests. Gandalf Kenobi Something mentioned news like millions seniors listed Florida residents either fleeing state planning travel back. staying northern states continue tie resources interest paying for, hence claimed Florida citizenship. can't strike. Tested Illinois, state lost results :) *sigh* don‚Äôt understand literally know people went Florida summer. care coronavirus.... actually did. GOF studies halted WIV Mainly posters thoughts people come (the sub). earlier days, came thinking I‚Äôd get cold hard crowdsourced resources people would working together make sense issue. Remember cool data / links people shared? surprise, sub spiraled ‚Äúsides‚Äù. 

People dealing fear way. hiding behind (real faked) ignorance others trying (on social?) convince party ideas.

My issue idea / reality two people different opinions / ideas / beliefs longer constructive discussions.

That sad part this. 

I used love talking someone different belief (political, spiritual, sports, etc) learn.

Now appears turn quickly schoolyard argument, something along lines ‚Äúyou‚Äôre wrong‚Äù ‚Äú well, you‚Äôre ignorant?‚Äù

I kind think people pause, take breath think, know we‚Äôre crazy environment right now. Well different way deal.

Just wish I‚Äôd see people, nerdy enough spending time Reddit, pause, park opinions, listen, positively engage.

The kinda sides, love thinking points made, think it‚Äôs simple.

My POV, probably spot either, and, it‚Äôs chance engage.

Be well, stay human always wondered could drive closer hospital greater capacity symptoms potentially worsened. Solo mission exposing anyone, calling ahead hospital take proper procedures admit you, etc. read it. title misleading deserves downvote belongs  r/conspiracy LMFTFY: Citizens shouldn‚Äôt give funds governments intentionally endanger children. sounds like hyperbole today fucks everyone. Jfc that‚Äôs much praise. Basically shows naive Cuomo was, honestly think Trump Federal government would actually do? 2020, years incompetence, impeached president thats already proven disregards science would actually helpful? Cuomo realized day 1 special kind evil. anyone else moved different state pandemic? so, go? Next month I'm going WI MN. tips move safely? sure quotes. China spitting distance Japan. generally Cuomo fan fuck ups response, overall right wrong.

This. I'm Cuomo fan general he's done damn job good job far. easy second guess decisions made crisis situation early pandemic knew little reduce spread virus, treat properly, etc lot harder actually one making kinds life death decisions. 

The fact NY tested way state 240,000 tests per million residents (!!!), far along reopening new deaths/cases every day testament effectiveness policies implemented there. executive pay excessive across companies industries, tiny fraction company like airline's overall expenses. could force executives airline work free might buy company another day two operating bailout money...maybe.

Not like executives afford take haircut right (and lot have) talking point getting fucking old. American Airlines spends $10 billion year salaries top executives make &lt; 1% that. That's top $30 billion expenses. US airlines similar position.

This progressive version trying balance federal budget cutting NEA. makes us look fucking stupid bad math. could MIL FIL talking. Almost word word. assumed regurgitating latest FOX sound bytes. lot locals annual passes. they've already paid experience. bored home maybe care. news could positively nuclear! ""do say, do"" country. Really? don‚Äôt think worlds tiniest violin played this. Sucks someone lost life, flirt death? 5 year old. issues cause? headline (which created news editors, scientists) combined together reason everyone claiming lie asymptomatic spread - order influence people. please define common sense? clearly common sense, people wearing masks. corrupt. absolute corrupt Government. I‚Äôm hoping seriously people use power then. enough us aren‚Äôt willing accept narrative that‚Äôs pushed since ~February 2020. Even still, sounds like best case scenario, we're looking Florida's results LAST week...worst case, might even two weeks old. Either way, we're still even seeing July 4th cases yet, likely 1-2 weeks (1-2 weeks symptoms, another week test results). could easily see Florida hitting 20,000 cases day end month. feel way.

I suspect lot year economy burning last embers people truly destitute.

Hell, bet even corporations take position people finally realize even close over. realize professionals travel stay overnight hotels consider vacation...it's called business trip. Grab suit, get job, try nahh honestly think going swine flu like situation. least countries managed virus like Germany like 60 percent want vaccinate here. 

 ""when over"" years?  mean get it. Travel still needs happen. right keeping everyone safe minimizing losses, maximizing profits.

They really need look alternate way seat passengers keep family units together separated rest passengers. virus going away time soon.

Obstructing nasal cavities charged mask, even level-1 mask, surely defend percentage moisture COVID-19 travels on. tandem diligent hygiene, social distancing, minimizing time spent around people, mask seems like integral piece larger defensive strategy. used regularly vacation Florida, officially crossed list, sorry. workers ok genuinely happy back work? also hate workers? personally believe go lockdown essential businesses open can‚Äôt fault folks needing work support family. reference? agree surprised risks full plane 1 4300. headline thinking like almost guaranteed get virus fly consolation, NC twice population SC, they're still better SC:

SC: 56,000 cases - 2x would 112,000 cases

SC: 950 dead - 2x would 1900 deaths Right. Immunity complex thing antibodies simply one factor. 

Doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt problem here. far science doesn‚Äôt indicate vaccines impossible. correct, produce enough. difference right now, one knows needs produced. think companies strong contender producing advance. 

I think major issue final production, packaging distribution take time. talking needing vaccinate billions. think see prioritization based need susceptible complications virus. also expect ever prioritization used questioned lot people. 5 min poc test 3 hour PCR reported day Welp.... hope mostly people like die.... well aware it‚Äôs number people involves mention people they‚Äôll come contact everyday working parks. 

How see difference let‚Äôs say gas station 5 employees? There's herd immunity flu. bought last bottle Windex Target today. said previous reply comment thinking different sub. reviewing post sub definitely correct. scientifically accurate sub mean interfere efforts. opinion mask deniers still stands though.

Hospitals won‚Äôt advertise don‚Äôt want panic people scare away hospitals emergency. don‚Äôt know Detroit‚Äôs capacity really can‚Äôt judge. AZ we‚Äôre emergency protocols.

Also, hopspitals laid staff too. That‚Äôs elective procedures cancelled. critical care staff wasn‚Äôt laid off.

Problem is, can‚Äôt take nurses sections hospital toss ICU. wife hospital Med Surg nurse. told straight wouldn‚Äôt first clue ICU. trained especially critical care.

So yes, medical areas suffering, others beyond normal capacity. good long term planning. 

A LOT policies sustainable. know quarantine hurt economy election, make president look bad, hoping bump economy sacrifice American lives ahead election.

So long win election hold power deal fallout later. Yeah people cross road keep way similar. lack masks depressing inevitable outcome government prevarication issue family booked family trip Thanksgiving... know... understand could possibly stupid, are.

So, reading this, opening Disney World huge mistake. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You realize many non-essential businesses reopened disney world, right? Then, let's pray #1 does. again, purposely ignoring mask usage protestors. come grips reality opinion means dick.

The proof states highest outbreaks (all red) practicing social distancing, mask usage opened earlier sane so. Sarcasm: Yeah, let's ignore open schools students in-person learning experience we're it, let's require wear face masks. Nothing go wrong. Probably make good epitaph headstone.

""Here lies victim natural selection. wear mask died infection. virus COVID, thought fake. last dying breath, ""Think made mistake."" Almost rides lines doors WDW. comparable protests reason. vaccine developers injected themselves? Aah, right! thinking sub named COVID, COVID19. COVID sub denier sub. bad. Wait Bovine-Coronavirus hits Modoc screwed! think error less 2% past 11 weeks highly nonlinear behavior speaks far model's accuracy. 77 data points fitted ten parameters. I'm extrapolating two weeks understand limitations model's ""predictory value.""

What modeling *not* number actual cases Covid-19, number *reported* cases. recognize limitations trying model something even decent data without layman's knowledge epidemiology medicine.

Thus explicitly limited reported cases. perfectly reasonable include model everything apparent time-series behavior reported cases, including periodicity. attempt correct sampling error, model result sampling looks like. CA also taking seriously. People OC partying weeks you‚Äôre sick even bother line? would go straight ER. Couldn‚Äôt imagine feeling awful waiting line like We'll never know removed destroyed samples allow independent investigators near WIV. (post outbreak) referring local economies. It‚Äôs exact would happen smaller towns US military base close up. Disingenuous. numbers include antigen tests make positivity appear artificially low.

*just 'cause ain't sick, mean I'm well* /r/theydidthemonstermath takes new meaning bad news [Except users‚Äô eyewitness account says leads think majority NYC population already developed sort immunity otherwise we‚Äôd seeing spike cases already. Exactly. 4 additional months prep direct experience could happen inside USA, benefits longer UV light exposure daytime hours, much lower population density -- 353 persons / sq mi vs 421 ny state whole.

Let alone single densest population city usa.

The thing FLs favor higher testing capacity ny did.

Meanwhile, South Korea population density ... 1,366 persons per sq mi yet never topped 1,000 cases daily, ~50 daily. üôÑ think trip ill advised.

I googled net worth $10 Million yeah donate charity helps people medical debt something definition universal.

I'm Florida, covid19 sure, situation worse shown charts. Obviously reddit commenters already fact, due large delay test results (my gf tested 5 days ago, results yet), obviously cases continue rise. we're course seeing beginning giant surge, surprised number doubles one weeks time, see deaths week hit charts on. Testing available somewhat limited, could call around bunch places they'd say 'sorry no' '5 days now' .. recently many test sites 2 days tested past week results delayed huge surge tests. 2nd place... there's still Arizona  Yup, everyone NJ dead. realize true, virus still spreading, would replaced sick people? countries different situation us. covid parties people try get sick.

Basically body takes major inflammatory hit could take six months people bounce back.

I personally think premature call ""CFS"" - post-viral syndromes different self-limiting thing. asymptomatic presymptomatic person would appear though - without symptoms.

SARS less infectious contagious people sick (often already hospitalized). weren‚Äôt generally around people healthcare workers then. Yeah, maybe. noticed gone viral India?! Wtf? one disingenuously using 6/28 data evidence nothing changed since then, fine, let's use one week. Positivity rate stabilized testing increased. epidemic stabilized, doubling testing would drop positivity half, dropped percentage points. means epidemic still growing. 7 day average cases period risen 8,600 almost 10,0000.

This charitable view things think many many people viewed this. help leaders push reopening quickly without waiting results signaled people safe return normal. worry deaths flat, bc deaths totally contemporaneous cases!

Don't worry, young people, live hermetically sealed eco-system totally spread anyone 35!

Don't worry, least 214,000 new ""positives"" ""probable"" totally fake.

But Disney World worth it! nothing worth much risk walk around heat take pictures people costumes. thing Motley Fool good letting know billionaires club wants masses think.

From ask want masses think opening Disney World good idea. guess regular Joe starting think ""Oh hey invest Disney!"" Why?

Because markets transferring wealth debt. Pass debt little guy. guess big money definitely dump Disney Joe's buy leave holding bags. Look around definitely going back quarantine. masking covid death tolls getting higher coming much faster.

And frankly - think dismissing pandemic ""bUt MuH eCoNoMy!!!"", ugly reality, that's OPTION. choices ""shitty economy"" ""horrible pandemic PLUS shitty economy"". look texas (and watch florida next 30 days) - Abbott spewed whole ""we NEVER go back lockdown!!!"" yet fuckin' are.

Forcing reopening prematurely entirely calculated force people unemployment rolls. country failing act interest people, full stop. Fauci gives fucks wondering well. 39, done kids, bcp want go best one found works body.  Hong Kong, understand point? No. bloodwork good decade switched healthier diet started regular exercise. cancerous tumor removed couple years ago chemo radiation. really. Utah firefighter pension funded firefighters. hasn‚Äôt caused bankruptcy issue. Imagine typical american obey hong kong rules. Finnanotgonnaactuallyhappenever think paper , matter new original virus, US China, implies two points:

1. Facemask helps
2. Periodic lockdown helps 

Most Countries currently control made mandatory. stocked March 1st! couple containers left. can't believe can't make enough public access any. seen anywhere, since March, alcohol wipes.

After I'll use bleach solution spray bottle wash soap. I'm ok evidence mixed regarding finite transmission. Better safe sorry! This, popular song, cover anyway, even own. knows he's polls. Guarantee beating Biden, would wearing one public. starting see Trump succumb pressure lieu better polling. First 180 DACA. Now, this. No, highly unlikely ever it‚Äôs expensive characterize live cells. something performed small samples population assess overall immunity, like study did. Well, propose bleach injections, that's true.  obese think long term health make lifestyle choices so

I feel personally attacked. F seems like common sense. reiterate, availability healthcare resources affects mortality rate. Furthermore, portion population currently affected likely different earlier. lastly, differences availability testing means likely differences proportion cases reported time. Related criteria used actually get test. 

All factors change overall mortality rate without meaning case numbers ‚Äúcompletely uncoupled‚Äù actual infection rate. 

These factors also change estimates long takes die. Given understanding symptoms continued grow, historical estimates likely lower would now. related point availability healthcare resources, also materially impact long takes die. 

Your dismissal every non-death impact doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

In conclusion, slow roll, bucco. Israel anywhere else. People put isolation checked police health officials frequently tracked phones government.

We send people prison quarantine non-compliance. many deaths could've prevented administration cared saving American lives winning re-election. Nowhere near full. Hospital admissions, new cases deaths downward trajectory time. Go away! fear monger subreddit! Calm down, dude. ever blamed deaths Trump. all. Republicans voted aid Sandy. Literal privilege sophomoric behavior. say thousand extended cases.... 50k .004 confirmed cases. Say 25% cases weren‚Äôt reported. made 50k number meaningless talking 12-15 million cases. Maybe actually 10k cases month two recover..? think would important know many outliers even then, exclude 3 weeks safe. article basically saying people low IQ issue know dozens people say‚Äùwell really sick Nov/Dec/Jan/Feb never get sick, probably already it...‚Äù.  I‚Äôm sure heard that.  Without test, whether active infection antibodies, speculation.
 
Even though it‚Äôs July, people still going get sick reasons. two ADHD students begging stay home. 14 year old sat one day tried make sample schedule notes remind every class change, every 2 hour sanitizing cycle, every time gets bus, special rules eating, talking, sitting, walking halls. list took 3 hours. finally looked said, ""Mom, can't this. feel like screaming trying write plan it. can't this, learn, panic every time someone sneezes coughs. Please, make this.""  


When child never expressed single day actual self awareness says can't this, mean it. maybe lol him. One hope. roger stone dessert side get it. kept saying know? We've Europe. Studies already conducted. 
- Kids get it, though symptoms usually less severe adults. 
- Kids transmit, transmission rate others lower adults. 
- kids get it, found usually contracted adult close them, like parent adolescent sibling.

Maybe, USA would proper lockdown, could reach levels infection open fall... took us 2.5 months lockdown get safer infection rate. looks like lard per usual Higher mean democrat supporters dumb enough choose Biden australian im pretty sure entire country write off, fuckin monument stupidity corruption long unbroken summer vacation done rural areas kids living farms. Summer hay making season.

Farm kids cutting hay, sideraking, baling, unloading barn, stacking bales. Also cutting crops mower, using hay chopper chopper box, loading silos bunkers. Summer much ""vacation"" farm kids.

For kids fully urban/metro environments strong need long summer break. educators think kids forget learned school nearly 3 months, instead short breaks month long spread time kids school.

These urban students may fact school summer, requires air conditioning prevent dying heat. Air conditioning uncommon small rural schools farm kids get early June come back start September. Yeah argue want you‚Äôre part problem.

Think glasses getting 'cleaned'. usually one sink soap one sink clear water spray thingie, sinks refilled every glass

At least drink bottle lockdowns slowing herd immunity cells lead deaths long run? Character development Congrats pregnancy! (Seriously! I‚Äôm sure feels overshadowed bullsh!t, exciting time.)

I‚Äôm worried you. teachers staff support workers schools universities. takes huge team run school. I‚Äôve felt like didn‚Äôt sign this. virtual part in-person-with-disease-vectors part. Nope. signed help educate people, share joy learning new things, help guide young folks becoming amazing adults. Thank you, teacher-mom-to-be-lady. husband too. know super north, apartments Columbus OH window units a/c preinstalled all. Many schools even a/c. Luxury apartments newer mixed use condos central, generally. paper referenced article true plenty legitimate news sources practice journalistic integrity. People think pick choose version truth. Reality care. Even Maricopa county health press conference said, upon questioned, taking 10 days get results 95% tests. Brilliant idea. Someone send message corporate pitch it! Although it‚Äôs unlikely they‚Äôll listen (see above). unlimited? Yeah, I've seen that, it'll interesting see death rates consistent across age groups. many guns US people 'just something it' like banning guns apt lead armed insurrection, hell, we've seen idiots marching guns masks.

This said, *Why many Americans want shoot schools* also question asked. Lots Americans value violence peoples right live. Others live violent social structures caused poor governance and/or outright systematic suppression centuries. yea, we're mess here. Florida's governor Ron DeSantis. He's desperately wants Trump's favorite. stupidity. You‚Äôre fear mongeror right many upvotes. It‚Äôs crazy. testing means positive tests. vast majority cases asymptomatic. Wear mask. Everybody wear mask. stop throwing US way you‚Äôre simply cases. test more.

Take effect Italy‚Äôs testing capacities, positive count would much, much higher. I'd interested knowing sort mask wearing policies military soldiers. could speculate, conclusions would flatter military leadership. Seriously, brag incessantly soldiers run day hot weather 100 lbs gear. Surely grams mask would slow down.

Edit: fumblefingers Politicians fail protect citizens get public funds. much DeVos earn public funds? $0; made $45 million last year. 

We need rise stop this. Covid liberal hoax gosh darngit  reopen early skirt guidelines? $$$$$

Cali broke, thank 45. rates low state need lockdown, would huge waste. think federal government mandate lockdowns hotspots point, won't. explain Arizona example reporting similar average 7 day rolling weekly deaths fraction population fraction confirmed cases daily. Arizona, California, Texas following kinda data patterns expect compared NJ, NY/NYC, examples. Florida isn't, far. Well we're starting see finally, expect much worse. either they're get really hit slightly delay 2-3 weeks let's say see things fully emerge, something conflating data. Intentional otherwise. Deleted. Please please share. I‚Äôm going plaster everywhere, it‚Äôs powerful story. takes 9 days what‚Äôs point even testing?  agree useless. Got Saturday numbers typically low too. Going interesting bluff teachers come back fear actual illness. showing symptoms TB, assuming latent TB isolate for. Things going get worse, reason believe things recover US. schools open lose thousands teachers never replace them. Man, imagine everyone taken seriously beginning could better spot right now. Well, I'm go read state's (Arizona) Covid cases day read total opposite news. teachers become last resort past several decades.

The average teacher asked Frankenstein hybrid psychologist, parent, counselor, social worker, children's advocate, behavior coach, data analyst, quartermaster, entertainer, nurse, teacher. What's one thing added that? Really low. scientists believe need least 10-15 min breathing moderately concentrated viral cloud risk infection become significant. based case studies people got infected people not.

The way get infected seconds exposure theoretically doctor intubated Covid patient mask somehow falls off. Intubation release insane amount virus air. way grocery store kind concentration even everyone done nothing coughing hours walked in. daily testing Italy could ever hope have. keep happening countries control virus block travel countries can't. Sadly Korea option block travel infected US occupation forces.  Yeah good luck angle... :-) So... long start deteriorate? stop 16 hours?? long wait empty indoor space safe someone else leaves? He's bit fool. respect understand, understands little. one thing happen watch happened, crisis. Florida trying kill us all. Want show suitable locations w multiple luxury hotels located close proximity enough practice facilities 30 teams, gyms play games able handle broadcast equipment staff necessary, place inaccessible normal people isolate general population? It‚Äôs ridiculous. got test results back four days roommate it. negative, still going back days another. friend get tested college positive result HOUR. Florida fucked can‚Äôt believe anymore. also live side country her. NY slowing testing. see data test 50-60k+ given day, a,d hovering 1% positive rate month+ now, re-opening various phases.

Trump's statement teeth states want test more. Mesa community college opened 24/7 hard print custom mask Princesses bottom face it? looks like smiling?  r/Ireland populated douchiest Ireland offer I'm problem strawberries. 

Also lots bad green peppers. Bad pepper eating bug makes seeds turn black. They're always dead, know cut open see black core. (Or find tiny bastard dead inside) always something provides hope comfort people

Praying fundamentally insignificant meaningless level famous look made Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúbleach‚Äù comment immortalized widespread cultural institutional failure, Trump symptom. Wow guys tests all? I'm you, Newsom bears blame. published rigorous state guidelines let counties open willy nilly whether met data points not. live OC trust BOS properly clean toilet, let alone decide reopen county. housekeeping, kitchen, maintenance staff service bubble quarantined. weakness.

Yes are, everyone working Disney staying bubble, housed various Disney hotels leaving property. I'm defending doing, pointing everyone working Disney leave Disney.  guess always important real studies. time I'm thinking DUHHHH. I'm sure there's dummies symptoms going out, folks going walking around feeling like death active covid symptoms. Hopefully can't figure make codes work Holy crap. Florida's got 15,000 cases today, test results taking 9 days getback, gonna worse another couple weeks. awful DeSantis saying open schools, instead letting schools plan virtual classrooms begin with. eventual class disruption gonna set kids behind schools scramble get online teaching going fall.

I hope people Florida start fighting back administration, make huge fuss &amp; get national attention. someone tells jump building, mean to. 5000+ excess pneumonia deaths year. actual number probably 10,000. DeSantis hides data. USA get Oxford vaccine well? Florida current behind 24 states deaths per population

Especially pressers months now. look numbers keep looking us 4% world population 25% world covid deaths.  know math great us. scary second infection seems severe. ADE?

Remember places prevalence high low spread due lockdown. unlikely catch covid-19 twice, thus far low number reinfections, mounting evidence indeed possible Certain groups Asians States get praised taking virus seriously much lower infection rate muricans. also seen superior europeans lol It‚Äôs possible testing capacity responsible cool down, Floridians reacting numbers too.  It‚Äôs hard separate one effect other, doubt it‚Äôs *only* testing capacity causing cool down. three weeks increasing numbers convince stay inside.

At end day best numbers have. California, friends gotten tested times times received results less 24 hours.  get adenovirus vaccine upon entry basic training, general public get adenovirus vaccine - adenovirus can't get foothold spread among civilians easily rip thru barracks-style dorm facility. agree small margin. means enough likely die loses.

I hoping bad allergies contributing slower recovery. Yeah used live SC friends saying one listening even boss ranting online mask mandates stuff. moved back home IL 2017 election. looking moving glad didn't. IL leadership rock solid people generally good. got problem people plenty people using improper face coverings think best get them. Prevention goal since shop take care multiple older family also higher risk myself. Which, college professor, actually love. There's reason force people waste time straight-up memorization 2020 --- holdover nineteenth century schooling gotten rid now. 

Less time spent rote memorization means time spent actual thinking! Florida many covid deaths though. really bad pneumonia outbreak. Maybe someone look that. means reopen disneyworld. Fuckin A+ plan right Would still class size group testing using saliva testing (which effective already use) instead nasal swabs could really track remaining cases areas infection rates low. cunt can't learn fuck off. understand current vaccines tracking well. Nobody fingers crossed let guard down, there's reason cautiously optimistic. definitely impossible vaccine disease could relatively easy make successful, absolutely safe guarantee it.  Britain first, guys sucked hardest whole uk corona head start saw bad things become Italy Spain failed people like voted certain called Boris decided nuke healthcare system. Wales Scotland fine led progressive facts kind kind guys. alive then. ‚Äúprotests‚Äù referring absolutely nothing compared protests 60s. didn‚Äôt accomplish anything.

FYI, I‚Äôm millennial. recently, ‚Äúmovements‚Äù I‚Äôve seen generation retweeting memes. actually Fauci advised save testing, pool 10 people one test test individually comes back positive way instead Florida testing 99k test 990k *Orrang mqn bed*  please reference studies? studies I‚Äôve read measures far viral droplets spread. don‚Äôt proof decreased distance leads less infections. Would happy proved wrong. 

Also, here‚Äôs 17 week quarantine someone still contracted coronavirus. Even Nordic countries don‚Äôt recommend mask use healthy people. explicitly state guidelines. $$$$$$ We've always war w Easasia. Paywall unfortunately Let's open schools anyway leadership says.

This another reason worry children. Okay. Thank you.

""Look, Unions striking, need ban teacher unions good ~~our pocketbooks~~ kids!""

Who switched reality TV dystopian nightmare? People thought Trump would never president would never pandemic reaching U.S. shores either. Coming Eastern Bloc... wait till another country comes theirs. 

Side effects may include falling window. might turn straight willing risk that. hope think conflicts subreddit rules, still great article. Thanks sharing - even comments section. action deemed fit complete inaction incompetence. scary. Probably true, states schools going risk budgets drawn legal fight pleasure! totally hear brain üòÇ get lost asshole troll, spare us nihilistic doom gloom bullshit, good news, sorry want everyone else miserable shit ain't happening.  goddamit terrible title, supposed read, ""Trump administration maintains pressure schools fail reopen. Either allow travel (everyone) don't. New York. lockdown began March 22, peak cases almost two weeks later (April 4, peak 7 day average hitting April 10). Hospitalizations peaked April 12, almost three weeks lockdown began. 

Deaths peaked April 7, 7 day average peaking April 13. 

The fact Florida shattering records lockdown Disney World reopening spells bad news ahead. could lockdown tomorrow it'd probably August noticed meaningful decline. Desantis jail incompetence. closet racist pile shit bad god boyfriend trump. Lock em mean plan (or lack) far know downplay death count wait virus infect/kill enough goes away. We‚Äôre solving pensions/ssn problem pushing political agendas one hit wonder small cost everyone life. assume general instances COVID-19 reduced population plug info equation spit include higher number people pooled test (if say, South Korea) vs country virus common (like US Brazil) equation say fewer people included pooled tests? Honestly, really impressive hoax point. Democrats really pulled off. /s numbers posted today, in, present. That's get. 

Is statement Florida worse NY based predictions future? see those? 

Because, present, Florida less cases less deaths. think reflection many tests coming back positive sheer number tests performing.

Which terrifying. cloddedb said, different vaccines. Oxford thinks get early September November. start people saying year we‚Äôd one even came early next year still lines everyone saying February.  What? good news bad news, observation behaviour potentially cause concern, certainly cause vigilance awareness. sure irritated perception 'bad news'. I'm criticising personally. Look original comment. Updated variety sources. Yep, cases looks relatively mild probably last order weeks-to-months instead years forever people bad enough hospitalized.

I seen anything heart damage mild cases, I'd guess situation. titles like this. expertise aren‚Äôt enough, don‚Äôt listen guess. episode packed great information. Huh?  NY completely ravaged virus. Bragging like bragging fire finally dying already burned house down. jobs outsourced call centers India. opened one paper random found line within first paragraph first paper began reading.

""no direct evidence indicates cloth masks effective reducing transmission SARS-CoV-2""

I stopped reading paper. meth drinking driving guilty driving impairment endangers people. smoke restaurant restaurant kick immediately. 

If quarantined inside house month go get groceries without mask guilty getting caught wrong place wrong time. 

If tested day thought showing symptoms test came back negative? matter following law important fined $750 even though day expensive doctors visit. 

My point way criminalizing people nothing wrong. confident coronavirus. tested show negative. cases absolutely zero negligence person refusing wear mask. case drunk driving absolutely negligence matter good driver tiny bit drunk still greatly increases chances hurting another person yourself. 

The difference 100% sure coronavirus walk outside walk around fined wearing mask. jailed 90 days. primary purpose prevent spreading. Say thank Ron DeSantis. done without him. must changed, look tighten bubble. kind pay housekeeping support staff getting that? one side complied advice world‚Äôs medical community, would argument wearing masks ... Killing qualified educators one sure fire way destroy educational system. Short sighed thinking economic gain long, long lasting negative consequences society open schools fall without taking possible precautions protect educators.

How expensive even topic debate comes protecting knowledge youth. hope society prosperous future - well educated student, taught well qualified teachers. lose either educator student, loose big part nations future. lol many people going get covid newly reported cases following counties:

I'm 25 definitely high risk. tired. teachers dying breed is. Well hopefully Florida prepared it, lot time hospitals ventilators ready. one wishes death people. Ugh many times see variations fear-mongering headlines damn thing? get strain Italy infectious original Wuhan, think reiterated 1000 times past 5 months; enough fear-porn already!

Edit: anyone sub specifically; know keep making new new headlines although new information, drive us cortisol overdrive get coveted clicks. keep isolated ESPN lot keep staff well shit ton testing realistically fine issue people leave come back I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre really arguing point US time prepare Europe. did. No, it‚Äôs every 14 days. don‚Äôt reagents let many people get tested. sucks office started us go back towards end phase 1. Don‚Äôt feel safe returning released report today 200 hospitilisation range. last three days 400s. Todays likely weekend slump reporting. wont know true damage Tuesday wednesday Yeah, that's wishful thinking... 

I'm appalled first ring protests return work, plea impactful support. coruse said conspiracy make look bad. Let's say President country. Here's scenerio. Long distance couples want travel country meet up. words, citizens countries want go country vice versa. Many married. 2, 4, 8 year relationships. even year. do? say 2 year relationships allowed? None allowed? Yes, lot European countries got first wave currently experiencing low numbers. Unfortunately countries experiencing significant rise cases currently. I'm sure tens millions can't wait players safe favorite teams play. Yay, sports. FUCK.

I get ""exponential"" means, going 10,000-11,000 15,000!? O\_O ""ineligible testing"" - fucking joke. doctors could ordered tests, didn't. NOBODY WANTS SAY IT, WHOLE OUTBREAK HEALTHCARE WORKER'S FAULT (SPECIFICALLY DOCTORS LIKE FAUCI CONSTANTLY DOWNPLAYED VIRUS). goes individual doctors refused test people followed obviously myopic federal directives instead saving lives. leadership Enabling covid denial anti-mask beliefs. popular certain segment public. comment response purely political post, give break. quote JFK, Democrat. general political orientation states reopening south Republican.

But agree, we‚Äôd benefit people would adopt line thinking help others. think problem masks vilified bigger issue states. Force parents withdraw kids public school, defund schools paid per pupil. generally put mask pass someone sidewalk--but maybe that's necessary takes 10-15 minutes breathing viral cloud? maybe better safe sorry keep up. small fever, headache better dying permanently damaged lungs IMO.  much, mean 40-60k less dead people far, you‚Äôre talking Vietnam.

If going make men women hide nipples children, too. Like Cuomo gets credit handling issue. save lives. Yeah need something effective safely taken/administered home. ultimately get burden hospitals. replace teachers essential job:

From ‚ÄúEssential Workers paid enough deal covid risk. Essential Workers amazing heroes.""

To: ""Essential Workers need sacrifice thousands extra pay pretend life back normal."" 

I feel horrible essential workers deal with. due anti-maskers getting verbally sometimes physically threatened...all minimum (or close minimum) wage. beginning many workers work PPE.

I taking away plight teachers soon face encourage people enroll online option homeschool children (if homeschool, public schools lose funding many students districts able ignore it). let us forget many essential workers going months now. feels like everyone forgotten unfortunately.

(Edit: speak essential workers talking frontline essential workers‚Äînurses, grocery store workers, etc, physically show work deal many people expose covid.) Remember Tuscaloosa covid parties held.  honestly figured people smart enough suss obvious sarcasm. Man that's fucked up. Besides herding walking Petri dishes enclosed spaces, consider shortage cleaning supplies. Every school year elementary school teachers area (and probably public schools) ask Lysol/Clorox wipes parents, bring in. school isn‚Äôt providing parents can‚Äôt find locally. 

We screwed many levels. CDC presented multiple models. 0.4% one them. 1% another. yes, people pick choose want believe, even CDC models based best guesstimates. really won‚Äôt know true IFR get properly randomized controlled antibody tests. tried arguing person believes covid hoax, kept thinking I'm ""a law ordering sheep"" sees light. can't reason people convinced right. Sure Jan. No, COVID-19 first spread zoonotically Nov 2019; confirmed analysis RNA SARS-CoV-2. You‚Äôre fucking idiot Murica. empire built ontop stupidity. Hey, people get kinds things.

You‚Äôre racist micro penis. you. you. Pence visited without mask beforehand. Trump actually worn mask past, removes soon around cameras thinks image would used campaign ads/thinks media would abuse it. hope get COVID-19 I'm glad chose tell us story. right thing stopping risky behaviors. Since area started get bad, okay beat up! really want help parents, please take life. would hurt beyond belief. way get side cognizant going take precautions. Translation:


The world fighting clock develop vaccine coronavirus. One projects described successful led Astra Zeneca researchers Oxford.

But international experts questioned vaccine's effectiveness Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam, professor vaccine immunology Karolinska Institutet, agrees criticism.

She says studies far able show weak effect immune system.

- effective vaccine needs provide strong antibody response, especially antibodies neutralize virus itself. technology Astra Zeneca uses generally give high antibody responses, tells SVT.

The EU vaccine group recently signed agreement company deliver 400 million doses vaccine EU countries, including Sweden. Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam hesitant agreement.

- Signing agreements millions doses vaccine results yet seen right. surprised big decisions made virtually grounds, says.

Criticism vaccine based studies performed monkeys given vaccine. SvD previously interviewed Matti S√§llberg, professor Karolinska Institutet, participating project develop vaccine, results animal study. also expressed disappointment results.

Pascal Soriot, CEO Astra Zeneca, says vaccine promising. According him, comprehensive agreements, one concluded EU, necessary speed vaccine project.

- high confidence clinical studies show, moving fast, says SVT.

SVT reports phase 1 study, larger group people received vaccine, soon completed. Phase 2 Phase 3 studies also underway, include 60,000 people. results expected autumn. park outside, sure, half rides indoors even outside ones really can't keep sterilized like 15 people seat hour vehicles designed pack people waited lines designed put many people possible smallest space. like going beach park risk pretty small stay away people, actually impossible distance hundreds people touching surfaces. Right pace herd immunity!! Sounds like mistake. Unless think agenda? would lie specifically? general though, work ethic double edged; Japan soft locked people still went fro work seen weaklink go even sick.

This going right now. mentioned in-person attendance optional (a one-off day) arrive work voiced sense guilt everything went back ""in-person attendance required"".

As said, work ethic definitely virtues, also become stupidly excessive times. I'm island middle ocean beautiful love weather beaches I'm really worried isolated ia huge wave winter much cell immunity  may, personally know one survivor lung damage result infection Best I‚Äôve found NYC. Antibody tests around 25%, fatality rate entire city COVID19 0.26%. 1% overall extrapolate it. concede could low 0.5 maybe high 1.25% isnt. done tories done abit later make look like something different. row back later today. much press saying done based people's advice. ""Don't help russia dammit, president!""


""nooooo, exactly - stop!"" Vote? help? Voting doesnt get rid idiots. paranoia around him? wounded, serve? Come US South, virus hoax stores restocked! Eh says inner packaging don‚Äôt think wiping would done good. even found traces it, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs still infectious. 

Tbh wiping everything first months, since there‚Äôs really much indication thing transmissible packaging surfaces long. We‚Äôve switched making sure wash hands thoroughly unloading groceries touching food packaging first couple days shop. there‚Äôs negligible risk fomite transmission. Way practical Penang better Penang food.

But point remains regardless. Dragged away storm troopers, banned life disney properties. would hopefully nip future mask scofflaws bud. invited known positive COVID19 case party surprised got sick?

I...don't even know say that. good see Di$ney priorities straight. Guess $acrifices something. Canada, govt repurposed military thing, due amount Personal Support Workers Nurses getting ‚ÄòRona didn‚Äôt proper PPE practices ‚Äî thanks greedy corporations siphoned truckloads cash walked away shit hit fan.

‚Äî exposed private corporations improper safety practices multiple institutions, originally led numerous fatalities.

In US though? Guaranteed there‚Äôs going many idiotic zealot republicans thinking it‚Äòs takeover. said *tries* appear. Important distinction.

It's carefully planned. inevitably gets called shit, he'll say stuff like ""oh I'm smart, I've even admitted smart.""

 However, he's one one element, tries appear like deep thinker / authority. gets incredibly tiring.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah bro ""their"". Horse shoe theory work. like people hate. Always assuming never welcoming different ideas opinions. I'm Mexican American ideas, dont fit bullshit labels Good see ‚Äúleader‚Äù finally *following*. Fucking Christ country fucked. sort authority shhhhh, tell him. It'll amusing watch yell it, it. havent used public transport since 15, half life!

Luckily im lorry driver use truck, dont go inside customers buildings wear mask quickly give keys go straight back truck.

Its wearing one minute so. panic, start hyperventilating. definitely psychological.

I tried wear one Tesco's Ive one shopping alot vulnerable family members end wearing wrong breath properly.

My wife NHS worked Covid ward patients workplace (mental health) started getting staff werent cautious were.

The shop since mid March outside single supermarket Smyths toys take 3 11 year old spend abit Birthday money got opening time people inside.

Otherwise, hell would want go anywhere? over, Tories made right mess anything, think still much restricted environment testing everyone. Absolute rubbish. Sturgeon handing Boris ass plate this. like goddam act terror. Yes, true. It‚Äôs also true it‚Äôs hard people avoid going restaurants birthday parties. go work, social events optional. critiquing you, see OP coming from.  friend posted reaching denier friends literally posted 3000 word fb comments citing every single one things time. Apparently bill gates using vaccines reproductive health try reduce population based one thing said single TED Talk video. people refuse drink tap water due fluoride (dehydrating themselves) complain 5g causing headaches (just like migraines get I'm dehydrated.)

It's wild recite script like bought Costco super pack conspiracy theories think it‚Äôs pretty clear US wrong way. That‚Äôs thing I‚Äôm certain of. Also, last study saw showed Sweden nowhere near herd immunity. That‚Äôs dangerous game play Sometimes costco always sell immediately. People like OP get kind credit, grandmothers care home always local kids singing, went visit gran dancing lovely african man I've seen smile like years....

Afterwards said, 

""if man little bit older, think gran would've chance.""

The guy approached afterwards thank enough making feel alive again.

"" worries, church kind thing, say this, got wandering hands lady""

I confused... turns got handful cheeks dancing, get mean....

They come dance every month nan always dances man haha, even though finds little handie....

I've never known kindness untill saw people donate time nothing return.... 

Truly humanity strive for.

So OP rock &amp; could I'd buy drink ! show every anti masker country saved. maybe hopefully things begin straighten out. State Trooper wearing mask pretty shitty wearing got face examining picture driver's license, looking nostrils shit, like scene Super Troopers

Damn. get ticket cop show court sick.

Could Covid :/... like taking precautions even letting people pulling keep masks on.  really surprising mayor Orlando would anything get tourism started again, Disney half city exists Universal, Seaworld, thousand tourist oriented businesses rest. 

The surprise anyone actually listening going Orlando know going clusterfuck. _might_ able get virus long incubation period infecting people sufficiently fast approach cusp. extra 2 weeks worth infectious people virus stalling.

For ridiculously extreme example imagine incubation period 5 years. Even infections reach 70% mean 70% immune 70% still infectious.

Any epidemiology students thread take days simulate this? Sir, that's mirror. *Mask-a-Lago* little late They're allowed supermarket delivery etc. Three meals day provided free order whatever want online. BBC reliable source. claimed 20 people died meat plant outbreak germany 1500 infected. Truth nobody died, needed ICU tho. 20 deaths whole region since march. BBC still corrected lie. Think problem feeling seems died locally. around 300k population get single figure case numbers week. gone 2-3 days row couple times last month 0 new cases. 

When high case numbers lot people wearing masks now...

I'm hopeful mandate masks shops top transport (most) people then. slight increase national cases minute - slight - might reduce spike do. like calling juice like 100.  years? often typed autocorrects previous penis ü§£

But yeah that's excess deaths, that's number. Today's deaths sum of: 
Last years average 
+corona 
+28-35% (of corona deaths) additional

These additional would contain undetected corona deaths, also pneumonia, diabetes, whatever quote study. say restarted sports practice Oklahoma, went expected, headlines staff players testing positive after. I'm watching NBA Florida. 25 tested positive, last read. agree, definitely going end well. would give entire staff oral sex visit every COVID patient sneeze cough exhale garbage bags blast bags open compressed air hallway scheduled PR stunt. presidency fairly easy end.  everyone, including 50+ years clearly middle class people public transport law. nurse friend got twice, so... Oh wow thanks pic, set zoom 500% finally able see it. worry, micropenis increased risk factor covid virus. üòÅ They‚Äôre simply called essential calling sacrificial would close home. ""only"" take red pill green pill??? Madness stupidity home town 10 deaths per day last month 4 regardless many tests given. amount deaths down. trump literally said wearing masks shows like him.
 
and people that's literally worse treason.  (they're fine actual treason) dare you. Thats strange cause developed country democrats provide populace freedom decide themselves. general consensus meeting small groups? example, band really jonesing rehearse. It‚Äôs 4 us we‚Äôre 4-6 feet apart practice could wear masks. safe? No, read known idiot controls journal zero problem comes fabricate fake news fits right wing narrative called lot occasions. journal Fox News US. 7 year old: autistic, gastroparesis. Everything goes mouth. sensory issues make mask unbearable him. bites, spits, chews hands. physically guided occupational therapy, hands placed directly scissors paper. speech therapy, mouth mouth therapist uncovered see letters formed therapist see holding jaw tongue. Every 2 hours sit toilet 10 minutes. requires aide make actually sit distract stays put. also control bowels, must changed multiple times day. way school safe anyone physically present class him. ""failing"" student school.  


On hand, also child cystic fibrosis. Pre-pandemic, school district one job: Keep 15 feet distance son cystic fibrosis student district. words, socially distance kids other, sanitize spaces infect other, wear masks near other. Instead, put school bus, placed classes, come small closet size medication room take meds twice day. involve local news child's mother involve attorney 6 months finally changed bus schedule rearranged classes, still arguments medication time schedule unsafe kids. failing school.  


Now put together, failures, oversights, factors controllable not, tell going work. isn't. schools aware cannot work even social distancing requirements, guidelines recommendations reopening plan. going that. still know best way time tell. Like epidomologists say Sweden right way could much better protected huge 2nd wave winter. others say Sweden wrong way! would think nobody really knows truth yet. distraction Roger Stone news cycle. Stay focused. M'freedoms *tips MAGA hat* terrible idea people die it.

Honestly parts Disney World could open. World showcase Epcot would decent candidate since mostly outside, could limit capacity part indoor areas. Downtown Disney whatever called shopping could thing.

That's though. rides involve loading people seats people in, highly doubt cleaning seats every single time someone gets ride. also involve putting many people vehicle fit time, even outdoors close enough spread.The lines rides bunch people standing close proximity, way tourists spread way designed pack many people one space possible. really can't operate rides safely. Lol country think mine? Zoonotic transmission. normal evolutionary phenomenon occurred. would China apologize for? using psychic powers know exterminate bats certain cave? Disney tons money? gonna make certain life never get anywhere close normal years come. got idiots social distance, let alone wear mask minutes. point hoping vaccine gets soon... something help way stop stupidity. What? He's always pro mask wearing. He's tremendous mask wearer. He's got biggest mask wearing numbers there.

Don't fooled fake news telling wearing them. definitely something egregious quoting words okay. yes, right Okay *mom* He's finally understood wear mask sake everyone around you. I'm 100% covid denier (both grandparents cousin back home it), I've seen story shared couple times something always reads little weird me. corroboration apart doctor told story? best believe still remember Hillary's emails... Massive verifiable.  Idk normal I've rarely ever gotten fevers. get sick body gets cold. would always go school sick cause fever parents thought taking :/ see problem: country suitcase. Yup Italy 2-3 weeks ahead. Trump banned travel EU mid-March already late nobody held NYC accountable? Like A-holes knew spreading virus states shut down. NYC directly responsible Texas situation.  Navarro moron who's even respected field. He's minnow compared Fauci. That's great hear. hope second wave though. Florida going hundreds deaths daily soon. live Leicester UK I'm even allowed leave city. Trump said

Wow hope joking lmaoo put words mouth, trash based flawed interpretation.  

I never said COVID something could totally avoided personal choices.  seeing explosion cases states wearing masks, maintaining good hand hygiene, limiting exposure, maintaining social distancing.  

The Northeast dropped infection rate, people worried go back what's happening states, merely pointed northeast continues right things explosion cases. 

Japan never needed shutdown, why? **everyone** wearing mask, maintaining good hand hygiene, limiting exposure, maintaining social distancing.  things need done easy, real easy many countries proved point. 

In situation protect best ability.  Short locking everyone house 6 weeks best anyone limit contact, wear mask, practice good hand hygiene maintain social distancing.  things need done easy, real easy. hard part, U.S. getting everyone responsible. 

I two family members household need interact public daily, following guidelines outlined above. 

Unfortunately many states Federal level people charge incompetent, frankly care.  many companies.  

I want get political, republicans years saying laws dictate behavior unnecessary government leaders business leaders always ""right thing"". seeing republican leadership proof completely wrong. U.S. 40% population care anyone anything themselves.   

The best thing protect long term vote Democrat November. said said copy/pasted 300 words so. asked two guys differ perspetives/views always good.

Would know probability going war pursing masters degree like join reserves part time go bill also probably serve 5-20 years idk maybe fbi internship would something similar.

I likely going business analytics. People think virulent means contagious. That‚Äôs keep saying ‚Äúmore virulent less deadly‚Äù even though makes sense. update wills

It‚Äôs extremely unlikely true, given unnecessary exposure involved school admins. would make quick wrongful death suit defendant asked deceased update prior exposing potentially dangerous situation. know won't. opened Disney...that tell enough. Well, dutch policy seem recognize reasoning empirically point say policy effective. It‚Äôs petty somewhat dickish. knew exactly meant. manifesto responded ‚Äúminor‚Äù correction I‚Äôd love hear ‚Äúmajor‚Äù correction. would actually interesting part this. Let‚Äôs that. hell guys THINK going happen schools reopen?

People going die. lot people. Surely coming surprise now? shocked don‚Äôt yet,‚Äù said Modoc County spokeswoman Heather Hadwig. ‚ÄúWe know it‚Äôs coming. thought coming weeks. Mostly, though, we‚Äôre ready very, county officials also first defy Gov. Gavin Newsom‚Äôs lockdown orders reopened, without permission, early May ‚Äî renegade act sparked threatening letter state. Sheriff Tex Dowdy said intention enforcing state mask-wearing rules. Like said, get test doctor determines life danger. One aquitances isolation month due Corona like symptoms go away. Even doctor admitted probably Corona, aquitance bad enough condition, point test.

Many countries less policy. Asking otherwise healthy people come tests wastes money might even endanger people need go test.

I would also add many different ways different countries conduct statistics. example person dies Germany official Corona diagnosis, die Corona. Sweden however somebody facility family diagnosed Corona, deaths contributed Corona.

With Corona virus, end day population get it, vaccine. would bet everybody getting likely end result. Yes, it‚Äôs called excess mortality rate. data dumps this. lot deaths world year spiked exact time COVID came COVID19 deaths. That's long time school treat way. scientifically lie? cannot find 'scientific' lie here. Yes, took centuries canon form. Even today, disagreement denominations. I'm sure familiar Walter Bauer's seminal work study early christianities (yes plural) great reading anyone wanting learn development Orthodoxy first 200 years You‚Äôre telling me. saw soccer tournament going we‚Äôre clocking 11k day Dude.. ""I've seen research. suggests crowded outdoor events pose little threat covid spread. seems little need worry types events.""

Show reputable data backs statement.


Because CDC says full God they're getting 15k delayed results bad really could keep it. hope see information Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Children, MIS-C, schools look reopen. posted sources would like expand knowledge issue. something else wanted add conversation?


The coronavirus causes vascular disease leads blood clots throughout entire body clog blood vessels cause multiple organ failure. respiratory disease. 

Any non-essential medical treatments put extra stress body risks weighed benefits covid-19 pandemic. Noted. It‚Äôs called entitlement....and that‚Äôs fuels pandemic... levels high low. Entitlement compassion. Would know probability going war pursing masters degree like join reserves part time go bill also probably serve 5-20 years idk maybe fbi internship would something similar.

I likely going business analytics. sister grade school teacher...in Texas. I'm terrified her. Bro cant use brain listen rules die Aite. Can't careful days. good bad? one hand infections means possibility hospitalizations, infected hospitalizations increasing rate consistent cases know about, make less severe? 

Not downplay it, still severe. winner almost 100k tests. Man, heck guys wear masks? Please save everyone else. Don‚Äôt forget obesity. Poor people tend likely obese. Furloughing teachers there's already national teacher shortage lead increased classroom sizes worse educational outcomes. I'm afraid spin like previous numbers, 3 methods.

1. Move goalpost. many COVID related numbers pick another one focus on, even make sense.

2. Lie. really simple effective. claim difference caused countries secretly undercounting USA overcounting. Preferably made-up story: ""My nephew works hospital, report someone shot head shotgun COVID-related death"".

3. Politicize it. Say Democratic hoax/lies. respected rights business owners it. Welcome brain drain can‚Äôt wait videos hit Reddit Still better supporting concentration camps, complaining immigration, Republican stance. joke also India's corrupt state. trust anything coming there. someone PhD Immunology tell B cells cells well understood effects immunity definitely quantified.

I really understand point post. trying say relative contributions B cells cells Covid infection long term immunity understood agree. also hasn't. long enough really study long term immunity since need observe happens time. said know well B cells work, studied decades. infer contribute long term immunity based developing activated infection. 15,000 people tested positive last week. get much on/off decision

Yeah. country (or area controlled borders shared tests) needs timeframe, everything on-off entire country Europe done really inefficient. It‚Äôs terrifying think that‚Äôll sufficient. Time build wall. Monoculturism vs multiculturalism. put blame people, leadership also key things like this. would take one HONEST speech American people wear masks take seriously listen health experts/virologists follow plans made exact situation 2004. \*Reopening schools\* awful. 

Asking teachers update wills honest consequences reopening schools be.

At least they're fucking admitting it. school districts aren't.  work kitchen,

Punish adhering proper counterneasures therefore increasing likelihood outbreak Japanese locals extra careful, essentially nullifying effort. Really good article. Thanks sharing. think point people know sick still transmit significant numbers- whether pre- asymptomatic. read study elsewhere said viral load similar symptoms far tired trying argue people wear masks, real disease, etc. go dig literature right now. later, necessary. not, maybe give now. risks placing patient oxygen lower it‚Äôs also cheaper mechanical ventilation, don‚Äôt see argue mechanical ventilation better patient feels fine doesn‚Äôt enough oxygen blood. started sending oxygen concentrators countries instead ventilators. perhaps thinking yeah I'm never sure vote comments articles like this, I'm voting information,but almost feels like voting said. Yeah that‚Äôs kind point. wish way basically kind study everyone gets virus. Good luck then. gun laws nothing make easier fro criminals get black market weapons definition marginally opposite mine. 

Yup, absolutely. understand *denominators base rates* \- don't. analyze data living? What's profession? US able that. haven't.  ""An American President's Failure"" - ftfy Hey dude know fact cells give us immunity common cold coronavirus variant. cells memory! catch cold twice row ask? Umm, well, umm there's evidence okay. Maybe outlier okay. New cases means next nothing without random testing greater context. 

By reporting new cases accounting selection bias reporting bias.

Either way, federally, absolutely push emergency plan put state quarantine need be. federal government control states legally treaty individual countries would have. choose use powers, however, cause country stupid.

And say aeresols last three hours 

How many people frequent grocery store day? Going earlier better news site. fact positive rates going down.

This usual fearmongering article nobody wants understand narrative must Nearly 143,000 people tested Saturday Florida 11.25% results coming back positive coronavirus. That‚Äôs Florida‚Äôs lowest rate positive test results since end June people receive tests. Wednesday, percentage people tested positive virus much higher 18.35%. ""I went Disney World, got lousy infectious disease."" Houston, woosh. SC test took 13 days. Seems useless point.  live Florida.

*ralph\_chuckles.jpg* OK, nowhere near 70% people going get infected. people solid immune systems. We've mixing closely cesspool city, covid, six months many people get it. I've known people gotten relatives/roommates/coworkers. Maybe people going get it. nope. Get fucked.
And fuck sub. Well thank you, hopefully manage find voice anytime happens future. :)  ""So gonna suffer gonna happy it."" point *normal* antibodies wear months, however *memory* body's immune system found T-cells, moment infection returns, T-cells like ""wait, know one"" immediately start producing mass antibodies, obliterate virus chance reproduce enough make ill.

He's got Republican's back. well. it. leaving house ""science"" science! Hence air quotes!

What think BLM is? Well, reading signs hearing yelling, black lives. sowing general discord hate. Yes, people groups exist that. might get it, hateful person. lure innocent people radicalize hate America.

As per economic system working, anti-lockdown!!! lockdown make Jeff Bezos others rich. definitely hiding death numbers least. Wuhan reporting low deaths one point, pictures trucks full urns (35,000 think) delivered around city. also needed mass order body bags Taiwan. live Texas. live NYC.

Just think Hollywood could spin this. scientists, top grad, want protect country deadly pandemic, guess what? People want wear masks. guess next years someone try make movie pandemic, bomb audience feel characters act smart believable. They've seen Americans live pandemic.

Unemployment remains high, people's lives affected store closings, restaurants closing, schools reopening (yet), on. things affect *everybody* including lot White-Americans well.

And little like here: minimal keep restaurants, bars, theme parks, concert venues theaters churning Florida 20 million people, new york 8.  New york 3 million people 65 florida 4 million. 

If assume winter 15% florida virus looking least 30 000 dead boomers .... They're wrong, live once. take bit different meaning it. Doesn‚Äôt even matter 0. many hundreds thousands infected never got tested?

There‚Äôs undoubtedly lot corona Disney. House seeks discredit

You go words know bullshit.

There non-credible White House history. Believe me, much younger 18. Total number confirmed Covid19 cases South Korea since pandemic began: 13,417

Number confirmed Covid19 cases reported Florida today: 15,300

Population South Korea: 51 million
Population Florida: 20 million

Them‚Äôs facts don‚Äôt even try splitting hairs data, try whatabout New York/New Jersey, blame China. 

This Category 6 shitstorm. 

It‚Äôs time accept reality join rest us trying put end catastrophe. sake country. theory deliberate keep us panicking. frog pot water slowly brought boil. It‚Äôs silly metaphor course frog hops it‚Äôs uncomfortable, there‚Äôs nowhere us hop to.

That's OPPOSITE ready. agree. trump banned china travel, Democrats called literally hitler laughed notion. Now, benefit hindsight, demanding stop air travel period. 

New york huge international airport.  states international airports too. Atlanta, LA, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, international, busier JFK deaths: 3,000

New york??? 32,000! 

Edit: took unnecessary swear. Point is, excuses. New york failed, failed big time. way they've acting think could count 15,000 week... 13 unlinked cases problem start tightening restrictions again. That‚Äôs uncommon school crisis manuals know epidemiologists? Wow reading reddit must‚Äôve made expert. What............? really understand concept business travel? Jobs gigs sometimes client facility far away travel return single day üòî Trump face serious trial. #FLexit?  people / can't get tested. think wages certain jobs could increased, increasing wages + covid also encourages companies move toward automation. Look quickly lot agricultural retail jobs automated past 10 years. Meatpacking jobs also going start automating faster order avoid shutdowns due outbreaks. Japan carry burden America like this? America selfishly governed country. Internally externally, like China. print hyperinflation foils plans... Tiny lines. scanned boarding pass handed ID (that part made feel icky, get make sure fake). pulled mask second show face.

 New York City densest city America higher population european countries. course, based geography alone, much easier virus spread new york city. also impossible expect 0 cases new york state authority shut borders force mandatory quarantines.

Look Hong Kong. even denser nyc ability restrict borders force mandatory quarantines, yet still rising cases there. Hong Kong ""proactive"" cases beginning, fact dense place means virus get hand. nBA island whatever probably safest place florida. one allowed testing quarantine. think it‚Äôs test get in. quarantine days tested again. horrifying implies actual number new infections much higher staggering 15,000+ reported today. chances getting shot there?

Cuomo constantly reminds everybody, federal government pointing fingers China restricting travel China, virus already spread throughout Europe throughout east coast Europeans. time federal government started treating COVID like actually here, New York already MASSIVE spreading, time react it.

I also understand everybody quick (correctly) shit federal governments hilariously awful response pandemic, moment people want praise state leaders, nitpick find way discredit them. governors they've forced position right now. Imagine Italian, Spanish, British, etc governments told people ""well, really want make plan this, we'll leave state local governments."" live around ""followers."" never wear mask give shit. naive think otherwise. think facts settled later,

No. name Nancey Pelosi Chuck Schumer. roll play ""nice"" backbone. Woot woot! We're #1! Last heard tests showing 30% false negative. test completely worthless thrown out. Germany much less death cases still masks law public transport shopping.

What say makes sense. reason masks Conservatives power dont want upset clientele would first protest mask law. Boris cares votes death. open. go one Disney subreddits see.

Unfortunately deaths stay long keep current numbers Lied? 

Science always learning adapting newest data. time March much less known time folks front line needed masks shortage. made sense direct masks harms way rather general public. 

Times changed. learned. guidance changed better. What‚Äôs excuse? 

Spin buddy. I‚Äôd take Fauci‚Äôs word day. absolutely gift US. able test everyone. already can't. could spike again. 

There 20 states taking serious allowing surges. Cuomo went super sayain pandemic Wrong. It‚Äôs negative sense negative positive. someone supposed astute business, I'll spell him.

MAGA masks.

He makes money. promotes cause. keeps people safe. Shark Tank would bitten hand idea. dont know. besides age comorbities, genetics play role, bloodtype, previous infections coronaviruses, gender, vit deficiency, tubercolosis vaccine showed help respiratory infections, Yes, several different kinds cells. instance, CD8+ (Cytotoxic) cells kill cells *after* infected. stops virus's reproductive process. also Memory cells, re-mount Cytotoxic cell response quickly.

There also Helper cells, aid B cells becoming Memory B cells. B cells create actual antibodies, stops virus *before* infects cells. Given antibodies short lifespan, Memory B cells stick around decades able spin production antibodies future.

Both antibody cytotoxic response important recovery. different lifecycles. someone's antibody (B cell) response shut down, may still cell response ongoing. actually cell studies done show might even *more* folks recovery COVID-19 antibody tests alone would suggest. kinds studies going become important get even antibody response window. God damn glad live northeast. get much cultish trying human sacrifice. Well true that's even scarier. article needs details better explanation. so? remember part message pushed. remember saying need masks. message pushed. think big test see KD performs, lot people talking still side effects months after. basketball lung heavy sport. species ""Homo Sapiens"", continue exist, least longer. every new virus disease, least fraction individuals immune. 

The party ""Repubicanus"", sub-species ""Trumpus"", might problem. Assuming can't get ever again. course, there's also reports people dying effects it, like blood clots. 2 months?? Man, I'm month 5. fucking escape. think getting better 20th time, comes back hits again.

M.E. that's long haulers got now. I'm certain it. Look up. Soak in. Start treating like that.
The sooner accept it, sooner adjust accordingly.

I'm sorry. then, mildly symptomatic/asymptomatics, % would noticeable tissue damage lungs, brain (anosmia), blood (clotting), gut (mild intestinal inflammation) ? likely looking Pneumonia contributing cause death. Covid deaths would Pneumonia listed cause. words, clear indicator unaccounted Covid deaths  Canada? Lol problem studies assume people recall accurately never tell white lies. I'm upstate New York people everywhere still wearing masks following guidelines Albany too. we're basically completely open point. city actually making proud right now.

It's definitely crazy was, get funneled Wegmans go inside anything grocery store pharmacy, think we've proven masks hand sanitizer effective, people trusted responsible.  would feel horrendous her. guilt. Airborne virus. Droplets minutes dropped quickly, smaller aerosol lingered elevator hours (closed space, minimal air change) take... Six feet distance people got infected plane studied SARS 1. limited study definitely take lot factors account. I've read 20-30 feet someone breathing heavily even talking loudly.

We ship captained fools crew even foolish half. another subreddit asked similar question found cases people self isolated well got disease possibly picking mail going get COVID-19 test itself. Everyone planning start schools Fall. *Everyone.* question details that, either ignoring safety completely sort measures place. Yes, wear mask. 15 minutes technically long enough contact opposite sides car, good. said virus discriminate **only thing helps** social distancing, wearing mask, washing hands staying fuck home.

And that‚Äôs *not true*. better heath also helps. People focus personal health time. Monitor blood sugar. Exercise. Treat hypertension. Etc.

Of course affects people types. risk reduced improve health specific ways. 200 new hospitalizations concurrent? sounds like rode elevator alone 60 second ride. people used elevator got infected, possibly buttons touched air breathed out.

Then yeah people spread others. COVID-19 messing Texas. situation Florida bad NY. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs bad, doesn‚Äôt compare New York. First off, majority cases New York came NYC surrounding counties. problem Florida spread among entire state. Second, testing much available now. New York‚Äôs peak, didn‚Äôt testing infrastructure test outside hospital settings. means New York missed many cases Florida missing now. Third, Florida beginning see declines major counties instituted mask ordinances month ago. cases increasing whole, they‚Äôre declining hard-hit counties increasing others. Fourth, NYC hospitals ran high capacity covid. wasn‚Äôt unusual wait several hours seen wait overnight ER bed open up. People died hospital waiting rooms long covid NYC. Florida hasn‚Äôt hit capacity yet hasn‚Äôt even shut elective procedures. 

The biggest problem still get much worse. people don‚Äôt start taking seriously, growth continue rise. reason schools opening three weeks. also think roll back least phase one, would close theme parks. Florida needs get shit control hurricane season really heats up. There‚Äôs still time trends somewhat encouraging areas. 

Thank god local leadership. think get 70,000.

big day FL, AZ GA kind cancelled it. need every state big day order set record. surplus testing available support higher confirmed numbers lot states. I'm Russian. total PR move. doubt that. Navarro also super pro hydroxychloroquine early got one sided shouting match Fauci. (As Navarro shouting). course wrong too. point still stands. sure, throw people disabilities bus laugh people don‚Äôt wear masks. miss America! Get better soon! 

Respectfully,

Canada ‚ù§ *years vaccine ready Medium blog, blog post. That's job. job health, economics. Trump plenty advisors economics. That's president's job take advice multiple sources combine coherent plan. 

The buck stops oval office matter much current POTUS wishes so. words comes Covid-19 bodies might fucking around bringing big guns. Fun fact: one reason stay base basic adenovirus vaccine can't make recipient sick, causes recipient shed live vaccine stool COULD make people sick. get vaccine gotta stay around vaccinate people clears system. got vaccinated went home, could spread adenovirus vaccine. fairly obvious empathy cared zilch anyone except self.

True, he's also prideful frail ego making lot promises would make look bad failed deliver. honest, he's done [far thought would. 60 promises half accomplished (some compromises) many broke really tried keep shot congress supreme court. current administration decent knowledge economics re-election.
They destroying everything path. second point absolutely atrocious me. Well are, make teacher explain death, especially death? school district do. That's especially appalling me. That's I'm asking. Well yeah, endless styles sunglasses, yet reflective aviators seem like official sunglasses India.  read article sounds like people getting piss drunk, getting car accidents trauma centers getting hit hard politics local. ticket change happens. Please make informed decisions voting get ballot November. Um...have seen subreddit. many claimed likely long term immunity b/c X/Y/Z I'm calling Florida America incompetent, read replies thread earliest someone got results 3 days California claimed good. got tested Australia 8am results 5pm day... week ago. Jesus christ, comment needs higher I'm TX outbreak area right-wing family members still believe Democrat hoax ""mild flu"" refuse consider things like basic science caution. terrifying. I'm high-risk, I've shut-in months now. give guy time day. 
check comment history. 
he's **troll**. coronavirus related deaths compared amount people infected? death rate staggeringly different two states. doesnt excuse anything, test lot people yesterday day.... tested 142k people: man sat alongside Fauci NIH seminars. It‚Äôs random blogger Disaster there. Hope Mexico protecting it‚Äôs border. He's happy many people want bring kids Disney kill covid. disgusting! good riddance ! deemed hoax. 

And, deemed hoax leadership completely inept, qualified incapable leading country. mask marginal benefit wearer, benefit. Better wear mask to. took like 3 weeks contact tracing figure one out. helped fact first family spread (the family one floor index case) two members cooperating contact tracers/police. chance, immune system, nervous system, cannabinoid system, and/or lymphatic system traumatized, develop chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia diabilitating condition. invisible disabilities New York Times talking about. work got colleague :/  wish nothing misery. news mention key reason local people angry. Japanese newspapers reporting hundred soldiers friends organized Independence Day barbecue party local park violation city codes, middle pandemic. link party infection hasn‚Äôt proven, it‚Äôs easy imagine color adds whole incident. USA! NUMBER 1!  That‚Äôs ‚Äúconservative‚Äù value pull bootstraps. Floridians still believing status quo ‚Äúconservative‚Äù values false misleading sure. governor collect pay check Disney board well rest ‚Äúconservatives ‚Äú Fauci quit let idiots figure themselves. raised blood pressure two-fold increased risk dying coronavirus COVID-19 compared patients without high blood pressure, according new research published European Heart Journal [1] today. addition, study found patients high blood pressure taking medication control condition even greater risk dying addition, boss asked update will, would consider assigned work task. would charge half day work time it.   Yep good point chance point problem here.

If NYS gets good amount cases imported Disney World, might show contact tracing. would largely depend bad outbreak country. Let's say we're right middle outbreak infections dramatically rising alarming levels I'll close borders pretty everyone citizens country month. 

But say infections coming we're past peak I'll allow everyone come includes couples they'll required quarantine 14 days. Try it. Maybe nothing else able tell severe symptoms. soldier tested positive quarantine arriving Darwin. covid free area. Perhaps depends local rules. I'm sure certain people read article already making batch sell lol anecdotal may great idea. would google theres cases ive heard exercizing much cause get wiped fault step brother! One person supposedly infected riding elevator rode. woman
They blaming setting outbreak never showed symptoms never enough virus show Covid test. people test positive family man later used elevator did. never physical space together. one else building tested positive despite man family presumably riding elevator multiple times. Remember woman say started quarantine. family went spread 71 people numerous social outings quarantine.  Thanks. I‚Äôm sick don‚Äôt even Covid Put protective clothing I‚Äôm still area ? it‚Äôs waaaaaaaarm itches bit!!!!! don‚Äôt understand is? it‚Äôs private insurance, individuals pay. nothing employers all. That‚Äôs rest world it. you‚Äôre afraid covid don‚Äôt sent kid school semester two. Maybe class sizes drop distracting bad apples won‚Äôt show teachers easier time. 

Schools need open want take advantage need able too. helped install new routines onto PCR machines hospital Canada. Normal runs take 2 hours new ones take 30 minutes. Yeah pretty compelling evidence, though never really doubted China this. think might rather amoral actor times, would certainly consider incompetent. 


Wonder looks like now, even letting Americans fly in? Seems... aggressive... except maybe NYC/Boston. February.  I‚Äôm risk, took early news Wuhan lockdowns really fucking seriously. or, y'know, could fucking VOTE november. know intro article said. aware virus gone away summer?

What person's credentials fact he's observably wrong? According friends TX Instagram, everything great there... use exact terminology future.

Something something first past post. Something something like maine introduce ranked choice voting.

Complacency kills. Something something Al Gore actually won, come one Florida petitioned recount?

The power comes polity guy necessarily institutions themselves. reading positive rate FL dep health 13,62%, looks like yesterday tested 123k tests.

I've listening interviews different economists since February (economics nerd here, half podcasts financial) even still mainly China, economists saying public health necessary economic health. People sick miss work, people afraid sickness go spend. Right beginning, controlling pandemic first thing recommended every reputable economist.

This 'but economy!' argument drives mad. worst possible things could economy, economic experts consistently saying them, people want claim done ""for economy"".

Looking economic perspective would awesome. *No one administration actually that.* point obvious give fuck anyone want see many people kill.

I'd really hate quote memory, ""the media"" quoted saying terribly disgusting things regarding lives humans live Texas. think I've ever said quote much... pretty strong endorsement US lying itself, actively hoping China worse despite evidence implying absolutely (though given Chinese government's ability lie impunity, sympathize skepticism).

China freakishly incompetent. Everything 'propaganda' foreign relations unbelievably trashy, least western perspective. governments made multiple parts, least see pandemic response incompetent. Relax. Trump says US ""in good place""

However EVERYBODY WEAR MASK! Labeling ""Good News"" seems premature, potentially reckless labeling sub. First all, Russia still Gulag system, article's reference ""Volunteer Test Subjects"" highly suspect. Test subjects falsely described ""volunteers"" notoriously easy come system lacks civil rights. (For record, consider USA good Civil Rights either, Russia always slightly ahead USA comes denying civil rights).

Additionally -- importantly -- ""completing human trials"" stupidly easy milestone achieve eliminate ethical processes, ""informed consent"", which, turn, almost always lacking civil rights abusing nations.

Finally, ""completing human trials"" factoid completely independent whether results trials either honest, represent actual data, meet criteria safety, effectiveness, production quality control.

I could go on, I've made point: Labeling article ""Good News"" sub shows quality control articles labels falling apart.

I‚Äôm listening advice politicians isn‚Äôt politics, it‚Äôs virus. words meant smear left actually describe anti-mask crowd they‚Äôre making decisions based ‚Äúteam‚Äù tells them. per capita wise, european nations deaths. Also, certain groups Asians US success handling pandemic smarter europeans well lol live hotspot Florida people wearing masks ever since original lockdown. home times go see people without masks would appalled bad multiple levels. Let's compare US vs EU:

Population: 328 million (US), 446 million (EU)

Median Age: 38 (US), 43 (EU)

Per Capita Income: $64,000 USD PPP (US), $45,000 USD PPP (EU)

Percent Workers Commuting Via Public Transit: 5.1% (US), 10-15% (EU)

The US younger, wealthier, smaller population spread much larger area. people commute work alone cars. factors gives US greater innate ability resist pandemics EU. American cities built vast suburbs sprawling across landscape, rather dense, highly walkable neighborhoods. pandemic one time low urban density actually helps public health. 

Despite built-in advantages, US still Covid deaths EU. Okay Karen believe it‚Äôs like five fold historical numbers. Disney subs crawling bots wont. Said doctor ever. vaccine part immunization schedule. kids given discharged hospital born. I've browsed much reddit hit paywalls sites know.. know county lucky ‚Äúweeks get results‚Äù bullshit. many co workers, friends family received results within 72 hours. mean comments Fauci reasonable time aged like milk, like saying January COVID threat America; well obviously poor thoughts like cruises justifiable March. critical thing, course, Trump made MANY like claims, especially latter category. also, Trump prioritize public health like Fauci does. Oh OK. agree then, thing. I'm confused comment nested one Durgadas, basically parroting fear mongering media sites, nothing original, one could also argue much based reality tied covid. numbers get pretty close accurate one week change small percentage point? I've seen numbers even decrease out, big changes data. Though looked closely last week. Thank perfect response idiot‚Äôs anecdotal bullshit. going get worse Universities k-12 schools reopen. 

My heart broken every day see new infections deaths. preventable.

The blood hands Trump, DeSantis, universities, people refusing wear masks, everyone else who's incompetence ignorance killed destroyed many lives. hope haunted victims rest lives. movie theaters sports fans too. Yes. friend mine got tested Fort Lauderdale took 9 days get results. worry, NYC. Florida Georgia cover death count, report third actual deaths. Alcohol cause lot problems South African ERs. pretty good documentary years ago Reggie Yates highlighted much. 

People townships etc get fucked up, fight, stab shoot hospitals end looking like military field hospitals. Unlike hospitals US deal results gang warfare, shooting etc regular basis, far less infrastructure. 

This stop cases alcoholism others insinuating. desperate attempt keep hospitals free possible deal rising cases already incredibly stretched healthcare system. would recovery even mean average person? happen first time South Africa introduced alcohol ban months ago.
 
Turns constantly drum people things like alcohol withdrawal exists, get less people showing hospitals ""suffering"" it.

It‚Äôs pretty bizarre, family member works told beginning crisis Fox pretty top it, even Tucker Carlson talking horrible virus gotta part prevent everyone dying weeks 180, saying it‚Äôs blown proportions nobody worry Citizens seen replaceable cogs. health issues drain system better dead. fact lot Americans okay this, even see source pride, what's sad. Glad put nba bubble there.  pushing side? want consider unresolved cases amount deaths? 

Try arithmetic again. see point. Every case either resolves dead recovered. cases unresolved that, neither that. 

Your logic compute. Really? flight LAX NYC still $72 roundtrip. years ago flew, like $400 (2 stops). direct flights $240.

Source: American Eat rich homie don‚Äôt understand unconfirmed whether catch covid twice. took college microbiology class, knowledge limited learned, I‚Äôd glad hear someone education immunity answer question. 

What learned catch virus, assuming it‚Äôs retrovirus DNA virus (and Covid RNA virus), secondary response immune system sorts virus two weeks. B cells create ‚Äúmemories‚Äù exposed again, body quickly produce antibodies virus recover quickly, days rather weeks. body ready remembers specific antigen. 

A case occur viral antigen mutates something completely different body longer recognize virus. 

Is question whether catch coronavirus twice assuming virus could end like flu, constantly mutating antigen? 

If case, aren‚Äôt basically screwed vaccine forever? new guess would developed year, like flu vaccine. We‚Äôd wearing masks everyone would hiding houses forever virus. 

Or another way catch virus twice besides antigen mutating? body remembers antigen way body forget?

Thanks time. Unfortunately, holding moral high ground, unable purge society. Maybe Covid hel little bit karmically. governor reconsidered ""victory lap""? idiot. He's canceling rallies nobody going. 
And he's wearing mask, looks like even dumbest ones finally waking up. Nationalism cancer buddy. hit 80K Sunday? Florida done part, batter AZ, TX, SC, GA, CA, etc....

Oh wait, say Mueller? meant Fauci.   Beginning end problem publicity stunt. Eventually, he'll go back wearing mask flock follow. Yes. think there's also culture problem. education. culture elevates individualism (""I'm responsible myself"".. everybody else responsible themselves, turn ""I'm hook caring community""). culture also rewards immediate gratification feeling powerful earned satisfaction respect. lot undisciplined, selfish, emotionally stunted citizens. traits make difficult get people things greater good things even mildly inconvenient. passed 1% population infected Florida Friday. Herd immunity going take long time. don‚Äôt see don‚Äôt rate. next week it‚Äôs going come. Nah that‚Äôs California Ah yes, let‚Äôs rush open offices again... really need look past 3 months- absolutely everything ""doomers"" said would happen come pass. really need stop appreciate virus predictable consequences inaction plain see. 

If stay course country going experince massive collapse take least decade fix. wildest part PUA ends month. It‚Äôs going get sooooo bad.  knowing teach kids describes part issue. son (who Kindergarten last year) really pushed back attempts curriculum- in, spent 4-5 hours school every day, 2-3 hours arguing/cajoling it, trying calm got frustrated. really took toll relationship, ultimately result learning much anything.

So parents young kids, special needs, idea minimally involved unrealistic. in-person learning even hire tutor, experience shown remote learning work us. ""Hes dead hes sleeping.""  -Batman furious years continued presence base there? That‚Äôs fairly new thing right? clotting issue vs purely respiratory? bad first, second wave almost inevitable open stuff again. 

Here Japan, despite fact (almost) everyone wears masks, we're experiencing second wave. seems infected mostly young people moment, deaths low, eventually 50+s start get hit well. slaves must continue, economy demands it!!! /s Bullshit. Stop acting like deaths doorstep, survived flu every year previously ffs.

The title going lose lot teachers- are, it‚Äôs clickbait. Something like third teachers age 50. Uh. 6 pm right now. World champs!!!! USA #1

It seems lot riskier spending week home learning musical instrument, camping trip, number pleasant things don‚Äôt involve crowds people.

Tomorrow, 200 ill. test 200. half newly ill go get test, positivity rate remain 50%. That's exponential growth. implying? FL stabilized exponential growth rate? mean epidemic stabilized? would imply 100 got ill day 2, half got tested, positivity rate would drop 25%. That's also what's happening here. former, Im really sure celebrate ""stable"" exponential growth.

That‚Äôs actually meant! suspect think that‚Äôs physiological processes feel like - feel ‚Äúodd‚Äù. used BP problems initially experienced terms ‚Äúodd‚Äù sensations, feeling ‚Äúwrong‚Äù ‚Äúweird‚Äù ways couldn‚Äôt assign words to. Later realized sensation O2 gradually dropping along blood pressure dropping. Subtle systemic changes like - things like mild inflammation, clotting, O2 dropping, etc; - don‚Äôt always cause classic pains clear organ-specific symptoms. Sometimes way patient experiences phenomena vague sense ‚Äúwrongness‚Äù difficult describe words.   whole time. bad month getting better moved ICU weeks got bad again. Really tragic. much hope. :( 

Another friend lost mom hour doctor called miracle case. Good point. High scores ment broken. America better. Wheres Florida man at? I'm expecting hear story trying single handedly break record. Sarcasm Yeah like send patients nursing homes...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Oxford vaccine already cleared stage 1 2... there's concerns effective may be. Going need help open schools. going Disney land 1/3rd capacity may actually encourage people go. 

It definitely open doubt many people see opportunity. corona virus cured November 4th? unlikely got tested recently (negative) health care provider said need test, say ""Ive directly exposed!"" insist getting tested. feel hard time getting tested. I'm northern AZ many options. Plus work, take time wait hours test? I'm sorry stress, work FT, challenging right now. hope get test soon stay healthy! know increases odds survivability drastically? Fat, skinny, healthy otherwise? Preventative measures. Wear mask, wash hands, social distance, stay fuck home. really hate aspect angle playing. try pretend people returning jobs brand new jobs geniuses ""creating"" ""new"" jobs. 

The school reopening going colossal disaster. like states opened early.

I know many times play game understand can't politic way situation. need conduct serology surveys can't take mortality data places infer infection rate that. Different states countries vastly case fatalilty rates knows many reasons. 

I think important us figure many people actually here, prepare better response second wave one coming. 

And considering sensitive fatality rates many people LTCF get sick, inferring infection rated mortality (which mostly took place LTCFs) particularly accurate. 

We need data. think instigating brigades reddit rules. might want delete this. People get relaxed see numbers go down. think we've learnt one thing virus going anywhere. point pretty much permanent citizen. Boosting stocks next sell off. That's gets me; would one thing people wearing masks, sanitizing, social distancing, using essential services. Instead crowds people outside beach cafes chilling masks, worries, social distancing.

I drove Dunedin Florida yesterday (near Tampa) main street, beach, etc packed. ONE people could infected God knows many others.

All need slow shit wear mask, wash hands, keep distance, stay home much possible.

Evidently that's hard people. üéâ‚ò†Ô∏è: state subreddit LOL. 

‚ÄúSure fucked killing thousands...but messaging, y‚Äôall!‚Äù go. Yeah media blowing first pandemy century. communicative terrorism!1!1
They speak football hollywood gossip guess. 50%. Oh it‚Äôs way worse citizen behavior problem. Fact is, maintain composure anyway. could not. cops deal bullshit still restraint? Amazing. don‚Äôt restraint business force. friend, Putin infected next. problem, believe actually easier empty trolley onto conveyer belt stand front, I'm gonna continue even pandemic, convenient!

If anyone asks move closer tell piss we're pandemic, I've once, everyone else given shit.  1. Many people sub exactly nuanced view point to.

2. Even believe people reached conclusion BLM protests safe distorting logic, fact matter protests produced surprisingly small number cases size. makes issue feel much academic. [He wrong eliminate, fast accessible testing, contact tracing, universal mask participation dramatically decrease spread. Fauci competent, means inevitable Trump would sideline him. lmao know. cause literally happen like 10 thousand cases america. people blaming shit China saying hiding everything completely ignoring happening country. bit late xdd. ' alone. I'm sorry handful people making bad decisions affect us. scary. Wish best. extent, yes. think it‚Äôs morbid hope Trump gets virus hope dies, twisted way can‚Äôt help hope someone else close gets seems thing get take seriously.

They also half face p100 respirators $30 replacement cartridges $20 best option protect around maskless douchebags. 

üëçüò∑ Waving BLM flag, right? Since protests going 40 days straight, I'll assume talking Math hard it, fuck face? Take bullshit elsewhere. People smart assholes like you. Screw trump fear got positive result it, decided wear one public hospital say later ""yes place went hospital wore mask, clearly work"" Antisemitism. Also Hitler's favourite composer. Probably due anti-Semitism. proper anti-Semitism, old school. modern day anti-Semitism applied anyone totally Israel stealing land creating prison state Palestinians fear got positive result it, decided wear one public hospital say later ""yes place went hospital wore mask, clearly work"" sounds like great news. anyone knows (or least pretends to) want ruin night?

The evidence continuing show American populace general isn‚Äôt responsible enough handle protected reopening. solution lock things hard enforce heck it. Next Day SF Bay Area too.

Mind-boggling. indeed. people full shit talking florida.

I live fucking fort lauderdale every single person wears mask without issue inside businesses.

Getting case count right important rubbing stupidity faces.

But later, we're manageable case count, fuck yes. Rub stupid faces. dispatched expecting shoot risk violent conflict low.

Police usually don‚Äôt expect violent conflict call counterfeit money either we‚Äôve seen goes haven‚Äôt we? may missed opportunity. come strong beginning led example wearing mask, could tons MAGA masks made. everyone would wearing masks today. might even made ton cash campaign. entire **thing** supposed shitty products name it.

Model limitations

There several limitations model. First, although model used predict equilibrium droplet sizes confirmed experiments using NaCl-bovine serum albumin (BSA) particles¬†[23], verification actual respiratory fluid needed due complex composition. Furthermore, composition respiratory fluid depends emission site (nose mouth) source (upper lower respiratory tract), well stage infection. Inflamed airways secrete larger amounts mucus consequently increase dry mass respiratory fluid¬†[42]. Therefore, equilibrium size emitted droplets may larger presented based composition healthy conditions. hand, saliva much lower concentrations salts glycoproteins¬†[43],¬†[44], due dilution droplets emitted coughing may lower dry mass.

Second, model based limited data obtained laboratory experiments. Harper¬†[12]¬†and studies IAV viability aerosolized droplets¬†[10],¬†[11],¬†[13]¬†decades old, none investigated inactivation rates function droplet size. accurate measurements concerning influence respiratory droplet size IAV viability needed better predict fate airborne IAVs.

Third, calculated IAV concentration based well-mixed room model recirculation. model assumes droplets instantaneously, continuously, evenly distributed throughout room. However, according Lai Cheng¬†[45], takes least 270 10-¬µm droplets mix thoroughly 5 ACH. may take even longer system become well-mixed lower AERs. accurate calculations may achieved use computational fluid dynamics. Additionally, recirculation accounts large fraction AER viruses removed HVAC system, ventilation play relatively smaller role virus removal compared settling inactivation.

Finally, research demonstrates evolution IAV concentrations induced cough activities, normal respiration, talking, sneezing. Fabian et al.¬†[46]¬†determined IAV RNA (i.e., potentially infectious IAVs) emitted exhaled breath infected patients rate &lt;3.2 20 RNA particles min‚àí1. droplets smaller associated cough; 87% &lt;1 ¬µm diameter. Therefore, IAVs exhaled normal breathing, smaller droplet size, airborne IAV concentrations would lower removal would rely ventilation inactivation gravitational settling. IAVs may also expelled talking, although knowledge, detailed experimental data phenomenon currently available literature. droplet size distribution talking similar coughing (Table 1). Therefore, model results expected similar IAVs generated talking terms removal efficiencies different mechanisms. Sneezing less common clinical manifestation influenza coughing, manifested ‚àº80% patients¬†[21],¬†[46],¬†[47],¬†[48]. main difference sneezing coughing former generates far droplets, especially smaller ones. Thus, IAV concentrations would higher initially, ventilation would play larger role removal.

PS got study linked.

Appreciate it.  compare pandemics terms infection rate among population? know 1918 Flu supposedly infected like 25% population seems staggering. NYer too. Definitely 100%. walking hour today counted least 100 people passed either wear mask wear one correctly. Lots chin guards true hero triumph, guess Who's ""in charge"" you, who's making anything?

I see anybody ""in charge"" who's said anything 'stay home', enforced forcing businesses close, there's reason go out.

Do believe reptilian aliens running governments, too? one stupidest arguments wear mask, yet there's like 90% chance would worked fucking president. hate stupid reality. He's puppet. want know who's pulling strings. People say Putin, him, him. 1%?

/s Hopefully go excuses could well asymptomatic. gets mean he'll really sick.

His health already way better be, would surprise gets away mild case covid. think people recover COVID, five ten years line they'll develop kind chronic condition due virus?

I think that's works. think people get sick recover come long-term effects. known they're recovering... simply *won't* recover symptoms. we'd know now. entirely capable declaring ""statistically insignificant"" disingenuity. reading lot contradicting material long term immunity COVID19. say recovered individuals maintain immunity form antibodies years.

How could know disease even existed year yet? ""I think hospital, especially particular setting talking lot soldiers people cases got operating table, think great thing wear mask,"" Trump Correct. Plus, wear mask protect (unless specific type). supposed wear mask protect others *from yourself*. trump continuing wear mask would endanger around lol talking fucking dipshit.BTW born raised fucking imbecile. government told flu? must watching different channels fucking idiot.

Again, one said losing 32k people ok. Even single life much. I'm proud now. got kickback major mask manufacturing company right? sort believe both. I'm lot freedom. I'm lib soc..

I never would guessed! washing?

What's dangerous online learning? I've speculated same, others, time get downvoted big time. IDK why, worth considering discussing  Theoretically speaking.

In actuality, people stupid, hang stupid people. So, people go church, instance like, 1 every 4 people coronavirus, people go bars 1 every 10 people. stupidest, go Trump rally might 1 every 2 people.

If wearing mask socially distancing hanging stupid people, maybe 1 every 1000 coronavirus, that. minimum respect kills people We‚Äôre sending best north know. news, water wet. demand see inside mask orange gooeyness within. Yeah poll numbers Republicans look like straight dumpster fire right, happened countries Europe total lockdown, America different New York densest population country. Florida got hit virus, they're already seeing number daily cases New York April. deaths lag behind infections 2-3 weeks, know Florida lying causes death trying manipulate data.

Based way Florida going, definitely surpass New York. think get generic/unbranded ones, still probably pricey (made Italy). I'd like know filter tech. I'm assuming legit F1 using it, info slim. 

One thing noticed almost mask styles, people start talking need pull tad every while. really stands out.

So Australian? G'day, mate!

EDIT: Throw another shrimp barbie me, eh? I‚Äôm America, there‚Äôs thing only
Going it‚Äôs absolutely necessary, whatever want, greatest nation world can, president doesn‚Äôt wear mask heck kids too, disease effects old people anyway. atleast kids afraid vacuum toilet. blood pressure ever low quick skim Trumpanzee twitter comments cure instantly. course mask presidential seal. better now? think would make difference. data world make hit home way me, instance. different perspective. 

I've seen expressed sadistic way too. Sometimes people relationships woman positive/naively acting man, pessimistically realistically inclined, become abuser. seek break woman inclinations ultimately incredibly mad inability 'take seriously' point view. reality, like say, much coping her. Obviously, gender reversal, used example. 

But also degrees. I'm sometimes quite optimistic hopeful, times straight depressing. two people remain opposite ends spectrum long period time many types issues becomes systemic problem. course, managed somewhat truly care love one another respect other's opinions. ‚Äúhuman bean juice‚Äù, hurm... people live operate unit. wear mask out, smart, don‚Äôt go unnecessary places, wash hands sanitize often, especially return home. must really messed orange makeup most* wore masks

That would considerably accurate. pictures, less 50% masks. seen worse ones too. Agreed, 4th July weekend going visible next weeks. Stay home stay safe Saw Twitter: ""Anyone takes family Disney year want family."" absolute tool Yes, call ""America"" God damn. Everything learn guy new low. literally keep saying head. Trump obsessed top, guess matter #1 deaths, SARS-Cov-2 positive tests, etc., etc. see ! fuck cares point. wish would cover mouth There‚Äôs higher work shit shut ideas implement weeks/months later own. clarify, article mentions people incomes 40k hit hardest. nothing article (that saw) specifically states next stimulus targeted individuals incomes 40k threshold. Hello tried that. Lockdown reopening everything on. Except suggest turn one time, good measure. Or, lot stupid people found every state. mean, wait? there! Roll Tide! Years now, people survive look back come way accurate number. one thing know now, today, 1% wrong. Back pandemic first started NYC, ED docs sending 7 8 every 10 people presented COVID symptoms home saying, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt enough test. COVID. Quarantine come back get short breath‚Äù  would probably want to, that's get agree it.

He's like toddler needs corralling --- doubt he'd subject constant medical supervision like that. Haha! dork! /s fucking sheep amirite? /s 

I hope helps get others follow start wearing masks around. Great pickup line winner!!!!

Let tell you... I've heard joke 167 times, **keeps getting funnier, every. Single. Time. I. Hear it!** Weird. say ""Trump textbook narcissist"", sound weird. end less votes come November, so... Yes exactly. mean 20 under. far know, demographic, virus deadly flu. Even 20-40 year olds, mortality rate well 1%; statistically worried health condition could improve odds serious illness. Gotta cover shit hole somehow. got shingles. terrified spreading face. chest pain scared crap though. Yeah, wonder definitely seen work, sure trump brand though. believes lying strangers youtube aren't. forsaken us. Pretty crazy president making news something government employees required months. Easy answer. continuing nightmare direct result federal govt. ineptitude foreign disinformation campaign meant divide us further. yahoos hyperventilating self-righteousness encouraged so. It‚Äôs nothing that.

Just imagine numbers mask, social distance compliance would potus encouraged back March 1.  Can‚Äôt #2, since mask branded. means took him. honestly think someone told distract roger stone bullshit workplace 700 people jobs ranging manufacturing warehouse admin. Five people tested positive none transmitted coworkers thanks appropriate measures (masks, temperature, distancing, hygiene). crazy infectious take standard measures.   I'd rather living anywhere else. bragging rights, would wear mask sense responsibility I'm forced to. guns want yet feel need money, mother owns several handguns rifles. 

""You right killed home"" know stupid sounds? sound like stereotype stupid American sure, pretty irresponsible. generated lot headlines screaming ‚Äúhey look, CDC says virus isn‚Äôt bad!‚Äù seems one dangerous messages send pandemic people getting tired routines disrupted.

But whatever reason I‚Äôm glad adjusted it. I‚Äôve seen lot antibody studies last months conducted soon enough virus hit area expect people virus test positive antibodies thought 0.5-0.8% IFR seemed pretty consistent estimate outliers expected (Spain‚Äôs IFR much higher Stanford study much lower instance). turns exactly estimate CDC now.

My hope IFR get lowered though doctors learn treat virus. Exactly. number cases either. I'm guessing states holding back number covid deaths pending result tests. surprise people died waiting test moved back line... see I'm going this? 


Also ways diagnose covid PCR test (lung x-rays, oxygen meter, symptoms, etc), seems like states reluctant rely these. know may sound controversial, maybe need test every single person obviously sick covid based diagnostic exams? Might better way use limited resources. Much, much better now. Low numbers, everything reopening, masks inside everyone, maybe little much carelessness outside (beaches, bars, etc.) understandable. Let's hope go like there's vaccine ;) *OVER 9000* Sadly rule stops applying politicians, case almost always least malicious greed Wonderful experiment who? coronavirus?  Way back beginning in, Diamond Princess study estimated IFR 0.7%. may spot on! long tail people end dying later (after studies published) Diamond Princess cohort couple deaths later. IFR inched 0.8%, 0.9% last saw ended 1.1%. long tail significant problem study published rapidly. (Meaning, essentially, covid-19 studies point) Yeah, like mouth... hand! Drinking home perks. price two drinks bar buy bottle. get get drunker usual since drive home. video games play friends drink. rip fat joint get pass comfy bed. Life good. Hated bar atmospheres anyway.  Corona virus less deadly flu people 60 don‚Äôt know point don‚Äôt know letters mean, right kids going school know what's stupid? look bad mask. worries image, he'd worn outset, country would better place. district even enough subs regular flu season. hell going able cover teachers best case scenario, 14 day quarantine. states need get control back started February. Omg. Fanta Menace got me. makes sense people saying it‚Äôs specifically target Trump. 

If add idea fatal older (none producing) population frees resources never know. 

I‚Äôm course largely speculating way think it‚Äôs truth. Yes course Covid 19 serious course take seriously. mean I‚Äôve following sub Reddit 500k...maybe even lower. know seriousness Covid 19. However know China willing sacrifice many things make sure country established top.

I sorry anyone ends this. Hopefully taken seriously is. WAIT Rand Paul said children can‚Äôt contract coronavirus!!!!!!!! WTH point seems like US committed killing senior population, given 9/10ths deaths 65 older.

About silver lining US politics swing left big way conservatism literally gets sick dies.

Who knows, maybe next time public health crisis country handle responsibly call science fake news. Hey, autism absolutely nothing science denial. insult autistic people his/her bullshit. loved cheerleading squad twitter congratulating 2 yr old poo'd potty first time.

Yeah. one confirmed case work week (who luckily worked since exposure Belmont 25th, probably spread coworkers), feel like matter time another case pops another source. Well, layers here.

They're surging like US is, particularly sun belt. ""wave"" flattened curved downwards, quite opposite sun belt fact. fact hit 3rd hardest (of reported numbers) different point. greater extent, NY hardest hit place US. rising wave.

England well NY sure. Actually, they're still pretty bad. still high numbers. clear distinctions we're talking easy enough draw.

""You read article"".

You confusing one crucial point: fact clearly understand article. Ahead time. It‚Äôs July It‚Äôs like catch worst kind junk mail ***say*** 7 studies? get shit together entering house child might lose me. would want child live that? can't protect everything life taking unnecessary chances. buckle damn seat belt, get damn mammogram, take inhaler, wear mask limit exposure little girl grieve mother, worse, parents. I've stuck Cambridge lockdown, people (maybe 20% people) wearing masks April-June, seen anyone wear mask 3-4 weeks now. anyone anywhere. 

Yesterday 10 cops 4 paramedics park walking dog shit, masks em. Went Tesco, masks anyone social distancing stuff 2 months ago pretty much window. think EVERYONE heap praise it.

Great, cool, let's get back talking Roger Stone, systemic racism, climate change please. Probably, die first. Yolo ‚Äúcommon cold‚Äù name 200 viruses...this dude acting like common cold one virus. Aussie, look US despair. 

We really worried second biggest city (Melbourne, 4m people) getting 250-300 new cases per day (&lt;1% positive test rate) initially getting control. 

The state government responded immediately returning full lock-down shutting state borders. reasonable response can't believe decisions made US federal, state local governments.

If got 10 people store one sick, ideally 10 people wearing masks.

But failing that, 8 9 wear masks, probably includes sick person, still good shape preventing spread.

This translate larger scales. Every single time scenario like one above, prevent spread, big ripple effect. Every spread prevented victory.

/S clear enough ""I think really justification move forward,"" said Governor Ron DeSantis news conference Orlando ""This virus five-day incubation period,"" said. ""So take six weeks started seeing something [reopening] cause [of surge].""

What DUMB motherfucker guy is, kidding me? 

First all, stupid thing say justification. There's justification re-opening shutting back down, matter one think best; rather, one least awful. Saying there's ""no justification"" retarded, matter direction talking about. 

Second importantly, fuck talking incubation period lmao actually kidding right now. fucking epidemiologist understand this. though thinks re-openings caused increase, HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY BUSINESS OPENED FRONT DOOR. fucking serious right now? That's lack understanding exponential growth. That's lack of... like... fucking brain stem. chalk us reopening phases based factual data ""well feels right open now

This happened LA. random Thursday evening (with warning) mayor announced bars resturants could reopen. people inside.... first night 500,000 people went without masks (bc eating drinking). LA inspectors later found 83% establishments inspected meet established guidelines safely welcome customers. 

End result businesses paying money reopen close two weeks later. That's lot money reopen wind things again. People's unemployment got super screwed (now work second time) virus cases quadrupled. 

Mayor using angry tone weekly adresses somehow fault rushing large cities state (SF) following suggested national guidelines / status quo.

Practically speaking, closed things ""under control"". me, means low enough numbers successfully contact trace vast majority cases. 

There would need layers contingency plans; plan student/staff member go remote two weeks they've exposed, plan turn school fully remote two weeks someone school tested positive. (It seems Australia handling things, please let know I'm wrong.) Ideally emergency laws would put place give parents paid leave care kids events. 

I know would still fuck people's lives, would less burden re-opening schools all, still managing risk.

I trust sincerity people, sure. bureaucrats failed us quite handsomely even considering epic failures Trump. Imagine living fear. reminder for? forgot. checked president done 4 years without fired? Pure fantasy assume director NIH would fired (by whom?) literally job.

You seem unaware American system works. President cannot fired, although attempt impeach him. Director NIH serves pleasure President, fired time reason, Trump long, sordid history firing people reasons good bad. literally made career Fauci respect nearly every former president, earned respect getting today course decades, honesty, integrity hard work, say current president.

As point repeatedly commenters, defense Fauci ""Trump worse!"" well that's absolute definition ""damning faint praise"".

Yes, Trump worse, difficult find anyone else done worse job Fauci dare discredit entire lifetime work cherry-picked misplaced contempt lead astray, without research, many GLOBAL pandemics would worse, work slowed progression HIV, stopped Ebola becoming real threat, currently working stopping Covid-19 tracks, yet misguided frankly pathetic people touting fiction attempting pass drivel fact.

Absolutely nothing wrote fiction drivel. Unlike claim Fauci invented modern plumbing standards living reason Ebola serious issue developed nations.

And yes, ""I dare"" hundred thousand dead bodies, many directly Mr Fauci's fault which, again, facing involuntary manslaughter entire blame absolute shitshow America right lies governors, uneducated public, POTUS trying pull plug early.

Talk drivel. Luckily Fauci charge, even mid-February, conceive locking even states prevent virus' spread.

""**Q. would never happen here, would it? Locking 50 million people?**

**A.** No, chance. would never browsing sub earlier saw ad national guard/army/something saying building 38 field hospitals. 

I think supposed inspire want join, goddamn need new field hospitals 5 months in. happening. Hard say we're literally months pandemic. could quite bad, couple years pass really know sure ""long term"" effects are.

This people really need realize Covid. know everything yet. lot still mystery requires bit guesswork. 

That's scientists could ""wrong"" time time... mean they're credible. Rather, imperfect understanding virus gradually update understanding it.

The death rate one aspect. increasingly clear mortality rate - particularly proper hospitalization - lot lower initial reports 1-10%. _long_ suspected East Asia, Japan already type study CDC estimated real Covid infected count 10x higher see worldometer.

But political herd immunity talking point nonsense Western scientists became increasingly wary citing lower mortality rates, could cause public start thinking ""it's worse flu"". Thing is, article showing, stopped political frauds using argument regardless push suicidal political agendas. like tries act hard wearing mask. half closed cases. graph shows 91.56% recovery rate. Keep mind Newsom originally said 26 million Californians would end May-he little off. certainly grey area lockdowns include churches. Executive orders also granted powers typically chartered state constitutions. apparently ignoring lot things happening around you. There's doc Netflix newcomers politics, Knock House. largely focused AOC, exciting, point really hard real newcomer. good watch, suggest give perspective dull.

Politics ""who know"" lot. pretty clear long time. right understanding point, politicians, everyone around wants get theirs.

You'll never go wrong paying attention, take time time time check thinking. ask ""is think I've trained think"" ... make sure perspective manipulated. matter side on, often. thing dont even get didnt want wear one, looks fine. Celiac impacts brain well? thought digestive. think explanation simple : US government local state government decided reach 60% infected herd immunity, corpse many. intend reach it, fully reopen rest world struggle covid-19 protecting population.

The calculation seem really cold blooded simple : re-opening early 0.5% population dead 4 6 months so, gain economical competitive advantage countries take 9 12 months come back.

All ""it Chinese fault, blah blah, w.h.o. warn us blah blah"" finger pointing looked another light : know lot dead and, since election year, want prepare deflecting number dead onto foreign country W.H.O.

Here hypothesis : right , next months, see next action done federal state government stem flood except maybe corpse fridge , mass graves weak appeal wear mask (without teeth appeal : fine , enforced quarantine, etc...). Idiots paying guinea pigs

Not disparaging SK way whatsoever. They've done amazing job. Covid economically cut us size. Hopefully new paths forged robust sustainable conducive long term wellbeing.

Astrazeneca's covid-19 vaccine questioned

UPDATED TODAY 06:34

PUBLISHED TODAY 06:34

Astrazeneca far ahead hunt covid-19 vaccine, researchers question whether vaccine provide protection needs.
- early results look promising, says Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam, professor vaccine immunology Karolinska Institutet.

This spring, six monkeys received dose vaccine developed Astrazeneca, exposed coronavirus without becoming seriously ill. vaccine tested larger groups people according company's CEO, Pascal Soriot, results look promising.

- high confidence clinical studies show, progressing fast, says interview SVT News.

Monkeys became infected

Pascal Soriot expects able deliver working vaccine ready use end year. However, researchers examined data early animal experiments convinced results. Although none vaccinated monkeys became seriously ill, became infected virus.

Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam concerned vaccine seem generate sufficiently protective reaction immune system.

- effective vaccine needs provide strong antibody response, especially antibodies neutralize virus itself. technology used Astrazeneca generally provide high antibody responses.

No vaccine approved yet

Astrazeneca's vaccine developed collaboration research group Oxford, UK, based experimental genetic engineering, sars cov-2 gene added expected body's cells produce viral protein immune system respond to. Several vaccines covid-19 tested humans developed using similar technology. Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam points vaccine developed way yet succeeded approved use.

However, Astrazeneca's CEO Pascal Soriot confident technology work.

- see vaccine gives antibody responses activates t-cells, results publish soon show.

Critical agreements

In June, AstraZeneca signed agreement EU's vaccine group deliver 400 million doses vaccine EU countries, including Sweden, Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam critical of.

- Signing agreements millions doses vaccine results yet seen right. surprised many decisions made virtually grounds.

But according Pascal Soriot, way get vaccine fast enough.

- start production already now. Otherwise take many months.

If possible take gap year without losing scholarship I'd it, sadly can't go school without guess I'm stuck ticking time bomb campus. Yep. threatened sue Rhode Island. ultra-rich going sell stocks soon pumping hype news news looks like shit numbers follow get another bail shit middle class gains decade. Roughly two weeks ago, made stupid comment virus going end us all, we‚Äôre screwed, etc. was, course, downvoted oblivion. I‚Äôm sure who‚Äôll read this, apologize post. 

I‚Äôve going mental struggles depression lately, please hear out. doesn‚Äôt belong here, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôll remove it. 

Truth told, mental health taken massive blow thing. 22-year-old obese male, fear virus every day. I‚Äôm Texas (sadly), small city live didn‚Äôt start picking cases week half ago. even somebody die. Crap got crazy real, crazy quick. two three friends who‚Äôve tested positive. church two weeks shut positive case June 21, exposed it. don‚Äôt know caught anything, didn‚Äôt show real symptoms. stopped going gym stopped going friend‚Äôs house podcast don‚Äôt want risk catching virus. Admittedly, yes. stupid even go inside gym go friend‚Äôs house. So, go ahead. Call dumbass. Tell deserve catch it. stupid thing do, admit it, I‚Äôm either two things pandemic over. 

Anytime I‚Äôd slight cough little bit sore throat, anxiety would SKYROCKET. first thought usually, ‚ÄúYep. it. Great.‚Äù check temp use oximeter three times day, everything seems pretty normal. Heck, earlier today oximeter said 99 oxygen count. Yet, still get worried. 

For now, biggest fear catching virus dying. Like said. I‚Äôm 22. many plans future. want live see them. Anytime go store, make sure wear mask. sanitize hands (it helps pre-pandemic, usually kept hands pockets). follow proper social distancing procedures. yet still live constant fear. Constant fear if/when catch virus, it‚Äôs me. obesity whatever, I‚Äôll succumb thing. 

Then worry bringing back home at-risk parents. makes feel like selfish, ignorant prick realize last three weeks, I‚Äôve going gym coming home. anything happened me, would massive burden rest life. 

All say, earlier today thought taking life. amount anxiety amount fear I‚Äôve had, makes worried future. know (at least hope) we‚Äôll vaccine September/October, still feel hopeless. Helpless. Scared. 

I don‚Äôt want catch thing. don‚Äôt want parents catch it. don‚Äôt want die. don‚Äôt want die. feel helpless right now. 

Sorry long post. 

TL;DR: dumbass multiple occasions, deserve called whatever name come with, don‚Äôt want catch virus die. seen statistics this... Anyone know real percentages? Pence would really well evangelicals, racist ""hurting right people"" appeal Trump does. Sure he's homophobe, go far used Republicans. Scared, Potter? Maybe submit order me.... 

Then show say, "" Cheezburger? "" Comical it? read it? I'm searching maybe dumb. Trump wearing mask thinks get reelected. fear calm storm, jackasses states blowing right going bring new surge northeast. Ultimately think Trump blame wasted daily briefings talking nonsense instead educating people. People needing educated government new countries retain knowledge via permanent civil service whereas America fires there‚Äôs President replaces often.

Most countries population watching specific message day day out. Americans got magic treatment plans, fairytale stories electioneering. Trump got bored went rails.

T√¥ fair social distancing factor lot important especially given heavy virus particles are. 

Here Denmark enforced mask use even government suggestions worked.

I doubting masks effect, government decided test effect small put official guidelines.  B.C. vs Washington St ? One mandatory masks, one doesn't....  think anyone disputing masks help. tool use. Well hopefully it! Scotland masks mandatory shops public transport tradition mean I‚Äôm completely utterly fucking trying save people little Mississippi town. repeatedly show research research, study study, know one listen,friends family wear mask use common sense! heart literally broken, cried self sleep earlier never cry. It‚Äôs like family friends rail road track train coming, matter do, one step tracks. reliable source. Hes speaking truth Trump doesnt like need Biden bad 98% mask wearing democrats Vs 66% mask wearing republicans poll. 
Results similar many studies. Trump found article, wears mask well cause - depends viral load caught. Honestly meds nothing.

that shit ones bad way hospital still good enough..... That's confirmed cases. Man come on. Honestly still person comparing flu. Ok I'll use analogy explain this. get car sober, percentage wise chance killing someone acceptable percentage. imagine get car legal limit still kill someone. murdered person purpose making bad decision based percentage come based statistics. One scenarios charged generally not. created somewhat civil society based laws laws based many things one percentages. Please continue ridiculous argument help perpetuate mindset allowing nightmare spread devastate rate is. Ya uncle buds refuse wear mask freedom? Plus say it‚Äôs uncomfortable... everyone wears one.
Theyre snowflakes lol Common sense, everyone it. that's part evolution :) Looks like Florida wait 3 years flush turd.  Hate bring politics sub, goddamn looks like someone finally realized poll numbers *atrocious* he's trying cover lost ground. American living England - people around aren‚Äôt wearing masks, haven‚Äôt told (except public transit, seems compliance pretty good). change even strong recommendation, much less actual requirement, mask use would skyrocket. now, people don‚Äôt want look like they‚Äôre panicking outlier - could rapidly shift way. 

Aside idiots, adherence social distancing pretty strong, lots people working home going much, etc., shows still falling rate cases deaths. damnit! Covid chances...  can't belive news, wearing start Nah probably part deal made biggest fear. Rant time:

31-yr-old Canadian hospital worker (security) here. Started college 2009 (during swine flu pandemic) security guard P/T ER swine flu screening, hitting second pandemic working hospital.

I feel nurses docs, least fighting chance. time deal ‚ÄòRona controlled circumstances compliant individuals. Usually mistakes made rather someone else. 

As registrars, fully encased separators patients registration clerks (as call them), separates risk them.

What do? I‚Äôm royally fucked. fight assholes CoViD. Waaaay diff risk medical staff, let tell you.

For us? Picture this:

Angry, intoxicated, possibly mentally ill demented patient CoViD-19. think get guy control he‚Äôs using fluids lungs biological weapon?

We do. 

Have ever done exerting exercise mask goggles on? goggles fog you‚Äôre blind mask hinders proper breathing intensifying conditions. Literally, available option remove fight you‚Äôre going lose.

Ain‚Äôt flimsy ass g-string surgical mask/N95 shitty face visor going keep droplets eyes, nose, mouth, tackle asshole down, face face him, he‚Äôs spitting coughing us, medical staff watch us get control, get mask him, subdue chemical mechanical restraint.

How many people thought violent assholes lashing Vid? compliant people coming listening every direction staff. Nothing done mean NOTHING get ahead risk leading Phase 2.

I coughed 4 homeless vagrants outside hospital, trespassing 1st wave alone. Ofc said ‚ÄòRona would infect us could. PPE need job efficiently WAY shitty surgical/N95/ non-sealed goggles. tested 8 times CoViD19 March 30 ‚Äî June 17, due altercations.

In Feb, watched video China, via 4chan, 6 Chinese ‚Äúagents‚Äù fighting guy throwing back van, breached quarantine. 6 full hazmat suits fully prevent infection tussling him. wiped off/sprayed cleaning solutions altercation good go. Would ever see kind PPE here? Lol. likely. It‚Äôs joke.

It‚Äôs literal death trap. it‚Äôs going take 1 wily asshole second wave 1-3 others fucked... think infection control occupational health safety departments give shit? Nah. We‚Äôre fucked.

People problem, virus cannot receive blame. mean would work. could also cause civil war. people get stupid they're scared, like trample people crowds stupid. brain fried run numbers can't vouch this. number kids 10 times expected death rate 10-15,000 children. apologies, emotional reaction end. They're experimental. They've working coronavirus vaccine since initial SARS outbreak. Remember comment announce virus airborne going need vaccine want certain privileges like working going college classes person. want understand American antimaskers think given situation ask yourself, ""what would angry child do?"" yes 97 years old Margaery Tyrell WH... managed reduce number cases even raging much higher level England. see. Also, guy said ""our governments havent pushed masks "", clearly true Scotland.

Our Scottish government telling us wear masks months, introduced legislation compel mask wearing shops public transport. Good grief. they're going ""get together honor, masks required"". Masks masks, gathering still kill *someone*. Dammit. 

You know...I talked nurse symptoms said everyone ward adhered strictly using ppe hygienic practices, yet she'd still gotten it. 

This virus joke. work every day positive cases. worry. I'm 56. could die. wear mask wash hands. Please people, this, least. yourself, friends...and families. maybe try call center type job.....might better pay least dont deal customers face face, coworkers management..... Virtual high-five.

Chumps like need others thinking still overshot cause truly didn‚Äôt understand fucking dumb cucks cause still managed able follow simplified guidelines simplified cause assumed huge part reaaaaaaaaaallly dumb ... still limboed ridiculously low bar like it‚Äôs limbo Olympics 

Fuck brainless MAGA slugs got blood hands ""I've always worn mask, invented mask.

Early 30s completely disabled. Wasted much money degree can't even use. one really believes either I'm young. reccomend joining Facebook groups there. found helpful things like accessability tips, general symptom relief, etc. Seriously! Karens sides. People quick tattle other. again. Left wing/Right wing agenda calling everything doesnt agree fake news.

Someone infected got thru airport without checks!? way! Fake news! need tourism ask media report it. do.

We advance airport checks worldwide:

1. visual check. detect someone infected staring them.
2. group thermal cheking better individual. /s
3. tell people honest paper know are/been infected.

Ha. Tabloids. Fake news! safe as... 2010. See, Donny, look bad. pathetic self conscious baby. don‚Äôt horse fight read ‚ÄòAs Band Played On‚Äô (I think?)

Honestly,I think mental health impacts dangerous younger people (even overweight) virus is. Find ways stay sane. Sometimes almost feel like karma.  Literally worse governor. hell. happily voted guy caught prostitute meth scandal. would still vote again. pandemic requires globally remain lockdown indefinitely we're going end herd immunity.   podcast called Week Virology. Griffin doctor New York treating patients COVID. know plurality anecdotes data but... might contemplate future reinfection possible subsequent infections might necessarily less severe. can't close border though. England gets refucked soon again. completely public knowledge everybody telling along. 

The virus sits nose throat attaches moist particles hydrophilic outer surface. 

When enters body, attaches cells starts replicating spine sends bloodcells destroy ""like normally would"". virus unfortunately attacks bloodcells sometimes nicknamed ""HIV-like properties"". means like HIV, virus destroys immunity molecules. Fortunately virus cannot replicate *inside* immunity cells like HIV can. 

So bodies react Cytokine Storm remove virus destroying cells. 

The elderly weakened succumb fast even contract small doses virus, virus immunity reaction destroys lungs causes blood clots etc.

The young strong virus run bodies try combat same.

It literally told. 

I assume reason ask this, literally thought virus would kill somebody else somehow safe it. normal circumstances, outside offices grocery stores, I'd agree.

But person ignores pandemic book flight/stay Disney probably going take fever suppressant get sick. want waste money, plus they've told friends trip want look like coward now. Yeah im anti-mask slightest. know point prevent spreading others moreso protecting others.

The issue amount people wear wrong, wear one nothing hands continually fiddling rendering mask pointless. amount people wear one mask go multiple shops, wear car dont change mask often also ridiculous.

I think masks become mandatory guidance properly wear, properly handle correctly dispose amount people wearing wrong laughable  one unethical experiment Fucking quitter. good streak asshatedness going there. think sentiment perfect. Thank quote source. Seems bit late lol like kids arguing back seat ""Not touching you. touching you. gonna do?"" Figure retribution means yet miserable schmuck? takes wayyy many people getting infected herd immunity take effect. It‚Äôs last resort use N2 smoking gun may think is.

I think main disconnect air never reaches temperature heated filter. Essentially, air passes filter rapidly there's little energy transfer. filter heating surrounding air 200 C order kill virus, filter trapping virus air passes destroys contact. concerns would absolutely valid system heating air, however, look Fig. S2 temperature gas almost immediately leaving filter (1 cm away) temperature 29 C (\~7 deg increase room temp), drops 23 C additional 3 cm. Exactly, it‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs afraid require people would lose it. I‚Äôm from

Kind shit headline CNN. president US takes basic precautions avoid infections pandemic, republican party shambles! Well perhaps realises voters die less chances win election shit? :/

Dark known. man dunno...  live? saying that?

People say can't get infected near zero chance severe symptoms even dying. Considering everything going Iran/Israel China/South China Sea - would surprise *literally* one. ever thought touching ball everyone touches would get sick Frankly, level hostility (figurative) need show them. used people backing whenever want bully them. one. point?

It‚Äôs instrumental funk/jazz band. members comfortable meeting agreed wear masks rehearsal.  ‚ÄúHandled‚Äù? young, healthy .... indestructable 

Man .... fear COVID pussies .... s/ Stone age people much smarter this. hope guys allowed mainland. 

Even Catalonia, mask wearing mandatory, Russian tourists hardly wear them. people tend stick rules home country groups drunk Brits singing streets bars without masks sounds like nightmare. really hope media make big deal it. best believe trump never wear mask spite. Sick strawman. there's much generational strife 45 elderly now. That's it, though. compassion him, compassion ***IMPACTED ACTIONS.*** 

He made horrible decision, I'm going argue that. But, dealing loss, finally understanding seriousness this, deserve compassion give.

It take death convince seriousness COVID-19, that's exactly what's happened.

Don't attack family, allow self-correct deal grief without adding it. 

***IF ANYTHING LET HANDLE GRIEF, PART PROBLEM!!!*** Yeah none come close opening pubs. Agreed lol. good self aware... kinda useless still willing believe good news even going lie [Here great article read masks 

The English government lacking response covid. I'm sure whether masks provided care home residents, virus transmition happen numerous ways. got building full vulnerable virus-prone elderly folks, many dependent staff assist daily tasks, virus spreads rapidly. say that.
Oh wait ‚Ä¶ increases airline revenue 33 percent, it‚Äôs wash /s Yes. mom works nursing home got covid started testing everyone week monitor it. one man completely normal, symptoms. tested positive, transferred covid unit viral load testing, basically much virus have, lower number, infectious are.

Well werent specific, described orginally fit BLM lockdown protests. They're thing principle need scientist point fact reduced lung, heart, brain, kidney, liver, gastrointestinal function risk infections kill easily simple bacterias common viruses. 

covid causes 'compromised immunity' cases; maybe young remember badly AIDS patients back late 80's early 90's HIV (the precursor AIDS) death sentence reduced immunity recoverable. hence distinction. 

when reduced organ function live long. period. disease like COVID19 attacking every organ body death sentence; die virus itself, die failures crippling deficiencies caused body attacks. Accurate. family member Florida works health care, swab done last Monday three coworkers tested positive. still hasn‚Äôt gotten results back. Side effects minimal. I‚Äôve told it‚Äôs equivalent chest X-ray. might Russian vaccine. Right? seems like common sense, symptoms you‚Äôre going interacting people. take look death rate curves state-by-state basis, clear death count increasing increasing time areas spiking positivity rates. national level, masked somewhat decreasing death counts states North East. 

For past days least, death count nationally upswing, predicted. continue. lag appears longer NY, could positivity data states like NY incomplete back March, due lack testing.

It's also probably case states terribly effected coronavirus July focused around younger healthier population. also knowledgeable medical care known treatments. suspect death count Texas/Arizona/Florida continue accelerate, percentage NY faced, due reasons.

Except, spikes control people would hospitals even go to. case, treatments body knowledge we've accumulated treating COVID completely unused. Didn‚Äôt governor Florida want report deaths  Batshit crazy havent closed borders would human trials Thailand work given barely active cases? Also ""at home"". Totally makes sense reopen Disney World guys  work private medical/research school first started impressed handling it.

just put damn mask quit asshole see proof, visit /r/nomasks Florida really something DeSantis  worst NYS many daily cases, said sure testing capacity catch all. going mean Florida?

....it's hoax
....Bill Gates wants eat brainnn gooooo!!!!!!! 

Give month. Going bad. south posting record new case numbers almost every day. 

Fact matter testing know proper time shut down, shut fear way early, got sick lockdown, opened haste time came actually shutdown failed miserably... start see results.  

Quit 'cher bitchin' put fkn mask! could say place. they've tested 1 million people, strict lockdown lasting 2 months, masks compulsory since March. Can't spell Arizona without rona hospitalized patients *neurology ward* looking article, short term, even 1/4 them. idea affects average person. 

Just give idea rare is: even say article ""Before pandemic, research team London would see one ADEM patient per month. study period, number rose least one week.""

Considering thousands Covid-19 patients, seeing one week statistically relevant. 

My theory potentially causes sequelae post viral brain dysfunction similar SARS, merely acute immune-mediated inflammation severe hospitalized patients. ¬øPor que los dos? White House head ass. I'll listen Fauci. Positivity rate matters cases low - Florida testing 100k day - today 142k (tho new tests) - 11% impressive circumstances.  Jesus fuck. annex Florida? least end travel from? Trouble is, Florida dead summer heat. Meaning going outdoors entire time. touch points restaurants, gift stores, bathrooms, etc. keep hearing NY well. may true comparison states, they've made great progress compared past.

But compare neighbouring Canada, still registering double cases 2/3 population. far 'good' yet. You‚Äôre cruel man. going die, hope find compassion life meet end. happy young people died attending party insane certainly true early stage pandemic testing nonexistent, one case far easily trace contacts case contain outbreak. South Korea, Spain, Italy, France, countries open time daily case counts averaging around 500 yet see increases case counts.

In event cases go undetected huge outbreak occurs like meatpacking plant Germany overseas quarantined-linked outbreak Melbourne, may option locking city/region instead whole country.

You never guarantee reopening won‚Äôt lead cases, lessons countries suggest resurgences aren‚Äôt guaranteed amount cases reopen important. It‚Äôs weekend test less ... that‚Äôs cases went Found asshat believes anything told. troll account created day reddit banned hundreds alt-right subs. Hmm. I‚Äôm Ohio.

Disney opened, school opening weeks, we're way infinite winning Oh that‚Äôs really cool! it‚Äôs like interchangeable frame different viruses? sad thing is, damage kinda done.

It's hard convince someone lied them, they'll simply think saying actual lie. office thinks going open Labor Day.

I'll honest, beginning pandemic skeptic, hell, see public place without mask now... hell no.. shit real... Thank you! tired conservative friends downplaying this. equate numbers testing more. active cases important, what's importabt hospitalization.

Is place data including historical state something like below? Would nice graph

Current active cases avg last 7 days active

Currently hospital

Currently ICU

Recovered

Died anyone info percentage people continuing symptoms hospitalized?  Imagine capable liking things!

The ones Trump supported peaceful. Kinda definition intimidation peaceful. result casualties sure make peaceful.

Yes lawyers expensive literally save financial ruin bankruptcy scenario. lmao pullin' karma card  stays though, eh mods? watch numbers week, see recent week usually way off. either direction depending happened report didn't. 

But there's good chance right, end lockdowns see historically low deaths. evidence collateral deaths pandemic negative far, coronavirus deaths gone negative excess. could change countries reopen everyone immediately goes base jumping celebration, though.

Europe's lockdown seen historically low deaths youngest age bracket, throughout. Lets go Disneyworld!!  People seemed assume relatively remote, less dense areas (eg. American midwest Balkans) would avoid worst weren‚Äôt hit hard beginning. always going lag behind areas spreading high instead prepared seem shocked finally here. think random chance, see statistics nordic countries way less infected community Sweden week measures started introduced before. think there's good news, though. Apparently autopsy evidence showing cause organ damage heavily biased towards clotting. hope would -- yet confirmed tested -- anticoagulants reduce mortality organ damage complications. realize Cuomo sent back nursing homes FEDERAL GUIDELINES ORDERED SO. That's right, decision. However, stepped admitted mistake corrected it, never happened again. That's true leadership. never fully agreed politics, damn good job handling this, every governor doing. Anything less enough, seen rising cases southern states. still beginning first wave... Burden proof lies prosecution. way people definitively prove got Disney unfortunately. Also you‚Äôd fighting quite literally best experienced lawyers money buy. definitely headline either Disney FL going Yeah yeah cool bro stay away us happy good old US A. Btw stolen masks fit? remdesevir bought empty works good? travel ban worked good? Fine, fine go buddy please stay welcomed here. Sincerly wish best stay away country gets shit together. maths. 

Currently 137,572 US deaths corona. 1% population infected far would need 69 times 70% herd immunity. 

137,572 x 69 = 9.492 million deaths herd immunity sorted out. president power conjure working vaccine. That's medical research works. Ya idea. question lot. Kinda seems like rock hard place situation right put first lockdowns lifted hastily. Also something rambling incoherence never fails terrify me. man controls nuclear arsenal.

MAGA masks would get snapped worn people causing problems now. one possible thing could slap ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù actually make difference, doesn‚Äôt it. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs trying fail worst part? still follow religiously concoct way circle back around previous points, excuse wear mask mean think they're fuckin stupid thing they're protesting actually matter. also really think illegal. like *any* protests put enough people move present serious viral threat right compared even something basic like restaurant scene. kids birthday parties neighborhood bigger attendance local protests.

I also think that, generally, Corona trend towards authoritarian sympathies dangerous. remember early lockdown Redditors posting videos police violence India captioned ""police finally cracking large gatherings"" reality years old videos protests things like religious equality. uncommon see Redditors openly advocate US becoming police state stop Corona.

Which exact issue, pandemic solved putting blind trust authority figures dictate masses allowed - that's exactly got shitty situation first place! US state help us this. saying Newsom handling well, really see difference DeSantis Abbot? infection fatality number = deaths among confirmed cases + assumed nom-confirmed cases

Technically, deaths among total infections (to use parlance... I'd use ""deaths divided total infections"" clearer). Since currently *know* number total infections, need estimate it, using methods mention others. Current estimates seem say ""total infections"" 10x ""confirmed cases"". Lol yeah he‚Äôs already bunch political science textbooks Since you‚Äôre telling truth sudden, feel blacks Jews? never believe words. though validation left goal posting. Really? Maybe could acted  Roughly 600-700% increase Pneumonia deaths compared time last year, 6k+ deaths attributed Pneumonia... like WOT M8? NYC, 40% positive rate. I'd extrapolate proper testing, NYC probably would upwards 30,000 positive cases takeaway is....? get take virus home that‚Äôs said Death curves trailing cases. think 20-30 days.

Honestly anxious theoretical situation, see therapist. That's elsewhere able get numbers control first. Reality enemy optimism 

Reality hero truth. grateful live state democratic governor. dems perfect, isn‚Äôt pressure follow Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúleadership‚Äù Teachers starting today get far less generous pension, least Colorado. benefits new teachers 60% older teachers receive years service, plus pay quite bit more. pension still benefit (thank god unions), used argument made career underpayment. they‚Äôre underpaid decent great pensions. Plus they‚Äôre facing pay freezes, cuts, furlough days state budget crisis. teaching 8 hour days confined space novel virus pandemic. no, isn‚Äôt exactly financial panacea teacher days... That's bs leadership collaboration need happen office. ""office jobs"" might hold true. Sorry guys word cavemen clearly much. happen :) know got downvoted, COVID, like said ground glass lungs (I 2 lung xrays coughing fits bleeding, perfectly fine). I'd love think COVID sounds way worse. that's terrifying too. we‚Äôre gonna miss schools forced reopen across country, once. welcome! Yeah, important keep limitations mind. luckily closed time fan Netflix show. spent majority adult life working nuclear power disappointed sure. helps explain Florida situation. anyone charge sees what's really happening?  Welcome capitalism! I'm sure situation AZ, takes several weeks deaths get reported. one person teh /r/coronavirusAZ sub used death certificate processing. said someone admitted hospital, intake nurse doctor sign form death happens. everyone running around hair fire, take time track appropriate staff. deaths getting reported within last 3 weeks stragglers 4-5 weeks prior. would quiet? It‚Äôll still sounds. possibility  praise leaders bare minimum. Many people reading news saw pandemic coming probably already arrived yet cuomo idea much spread going state. Late act many people died Florida 19 deaths per capita.

NY State 166 deaths per capita

Yes things get worse south. even touch NY went refusing believe random affect anyone way manage fear mean still good news - since deaths always going rise cases went (there's big lag bc time takes die plus takes extra week death reported), good news even deaths rise fewer people die would died earlier pandemic. Doctors new methods helping patients, vulnerable populations already ravaged virus etc. black white, good news bad news - bad news good news wrapped together. It‚Äôs sad much get downvoted simply stating truth. Cuomo puts good show CNN loves him. doesn‚Äôt mean didn‚Äôt make absolutely stupid decision resulted many, many deaths. People want blame Trump NYC‚Äôs deaths reality virus seeding long anyone knew serious was, Cuomo made idiotic decision. Despite Trump absolute moron, facts isn‚Äôt responsible happened NY/NJ. I‚Äôd place much blame (as well CDC WHO) latest fiasco regarding masks. sad know Democrat governor, post would never post anything anti-blue election year, even though majority states highest number deaths Democrat governor? kinds people inviting leaving borders open US. Anyone taking seriously travelling funsies right now. Abbot would allowed cities respond local needs needed rather imposing fReEdOm cough people bars things might bad. Oh god dude understanding this: MANY DEATHS SOLELY DUE COVID? MANY PEOPLE HOSPITALIZED ADMITTED PURELY DUE COVID. unless answer questions regurgitating numbers dont give meaningful info.

THE CASES COVID GOING TESTING GOES UP, OH GOD END NIGH! takes 4-7 weeks infection death getting officially counted stats. 

More half Florida's cases ENTIRE pandemic last 2.5 weeks. Ban travel to/from state. digged. (dugg?) saturate even that. month current exponential growth rate. Yep they're basically glorified trailers trailer park communities pretty decent amenities retirees. They're place Surprise, Sun City, etc. Weird people live know this. reported? People really want go back go vacation again. Lot pent demand  think draw conclusion excess mortality kicked least. [Norway ""lockdown"" March [Denmark March [Finland March 13 rolled around March 23, that's start seeing excess mortality ramp Sweden Nordic countries. seem like unexpected development even number infected countries (save Finland maybe).

Of course there's going variation timing countries, see proof huge number infected Sweden compared Nordic countries initial stages. Would need bring numbers. z values measured standard deviations, think need know many dead one standard deviation per country.

Looking later obvious something could've done whatever initial situation least. Food shortages regards supply likely problem

Unemployment housing/evictions however... Europe collection many different countries different beliefs, languages, populations, culture, etc. 

The US embarrassment. I‚Äôm pretty sure ask question ‚ÄúWhat dumbest possible thing do? also evil? shall that.‚Äù

Someone make us hats skulls baddies. cases yesterday. Absolutely possibility. Also we're 13 million global cases evidence re-infection sketchy best. cohort size, might kinds immune conditions special circumstances. Look New York - cases despite protests, re-openings, increased testing lax compliance. Explain without immunity. trying downplay bad situation Florida is

Yes are. 

Percent positive matter clocking tens thousands cases day. There's reason countries freak 10 cases go lockdown mode 50 - thing multiples quickly. Florida actually locked percent positive 5 percent here. 

15k cases one. There's spinning completely awful. means it‚Äôs test virus, antibodies. that, finding complications like *neurological damage* asymptomatic people.

Bottom line, libs paint situation worse unbridled hate president ushered one strongest economies 50 years.

I‚Äôm sure isn‚Äôt first time wore mask, first time made ‚Äúnews‚Äù really airborne, cloth paper masks stop it. need N95 stop aerosol particles reliably. means mandatory masking basically putting band-aid gunshot wound.

What also suggests number people who've exposed virus greater orders magnitude compared confirmed case count. supported antibody tests increasing number positive tests people develop mild symptoms.

Based documented number deaths, Covid-19 either high ifr extremely contagious (like measles). extremely contagious high ifr, we'd seeing depicted ""Contagion"". replaced blood beans went doctor (hidden camera gone wrong)

That's least 2 million view video idea. Oh look, fucktard adulting. Nope, recent study found 3.4% transmitted infections spread genuinely asymptomatic cases presymptomatic cases account 48.8% transmission. 48.8% reason mask mandates. open one Florida arrest them? Also, imprisoned 5 years? Let‚Äôs add $50,000 fine top that, several choices monthly payments. 

Sorry. There‚Äôs excuse. don‚Äôt wear mask, you‚Äôre threat human life must treated such. perceived rights cannot supersede right life. get covid prison, that‚Äôs fine. Natural selection done work, sparing future generations intellectually deficient gene pool.

Look NY‚Äôs numbers graphs. deaths trail month.  symptoms Covid-19 seeing changed. first three months pandemic, mainly saw people respiratory distress. Now, main symptoms see gastro-intestinal.

This find important. prevalent strain seems different mutation rest world. wear mask? three sources excel spreadsheet made, one bothered find, [fairly dubious even operated school polling likely get version ""no proof, eh""

You took words right mouth. agree closed, say Disney league comparing crowds parks.

It's funny spiking still lockdown like new york level cases.

If governor lying sack shit, gator trash would shut fuck states got affected.

Well did, that's past. Thing is, state still spiking going stop anytime soon. Deaths occur. pretty good Maine. community transmission. Okay, beginning understand, although book sars physically speaking decomposed, scan remain around cells although transcript process ""deactivated"". Meaning human cell imprint triggered, tricked, test kits showing book still there. made harder see virus independent host ü§î

Well thanks lot explaining that, hope find lots treatments awesome vaccines die mass panic squabbles war. understand data.

Why would test entire population? 

NY actually proves point - test lot come back low number cases - *New* PCR tests today 99k - whether look 142k tests 99k tests end percent positive 11 15 percent good. 

You fearmonger state produces 15k cases day. There's spinning *good* news. can't really compare conservatives US conservatives outside US. understanding countries conservatives usually affluent well educated people trying protect financial interest expense less fortunate them. viewpoint point extremely selfish, least know completely stupid. government tells pandemic wear masks, will. 

On hand, America, conservatives usually brain dead morons duped people much richer believing things completely stupid. That's plenty countries around world ruled conservative governments handling pandemic fine, whereas US conservatives simply living reality. *No dont anywhere copy paste from


FTFY banned subreddit truly wish that. 6 months late. would timeline look like someone symptoms, transmitted disease, somehow aware going develop symptoms future?

Sure, difference asymptomatic presymptomatic interesting academically. it‚Äôs going help anyone avoid getting sick day day life. don‚Äôt even know infected yet, supposed distinguish Joe infected never show symptoms versus Jane infected won‚Äôt ‚Äúsick‚Äù next week?

Probably least surprising thing I‚Äôve ever read. Irony people certainly think fake news. Thanks links!

Totally unrelated topic hand, I'm interested graduate studies are. (I MS psychology MSW, love opportunity geek psych people) world end. also thank fuck he's finally wearing one. looks like mix Fred Armisen Paul F Tomkins Much easier enforce business level. Businesses allowing customers workers without masks - period. reasonable accommodation would something like providing curbside pickup, allowing shoppers spread deadly virus store. would love see someone create website app people easily rate businesses terms things like mask enforcement. 

Reporting individual isn‚Äôt going anything won‚Äôt even still time someone gets message. good news seem number exceptions, hundreds protesting CA's beaches shutdown thousands protesting MI's lockdown. 

I would say majority Americans listening Trump. Well received $102, thanks showing true colors waste time ""debate"" drop charade caring poor working class people. Ignoring facts fit views... many disgusting people days. shameful. prefer Zapp Brannigan approach:

I fail see year 2020 adults get entire degrees online, pretend kid learn way. Oh lunches, send kids home. Plenty room budget dont pay lighting HVAC. Oh kids access, money budget adapt kids. schools already issue laptop tablets. Oh child abuse, thats separate problem state needs work let school safe hours kids. Thats concerning states even suggest reason CPS needs work. Oh socializing, parents socialize, like parents kids noy care socialize thats ok. kids socialize online lifes now.
 
Online kid easily get personalized education. excel math, move ahead class even advance new classes without held back class isnt great math. Oh child terrible English, get extra help different types assignments without interfering work. 

So please explain best way kid learn 1st shift, class 20 30 individuals different learning needs. looks like bunch people mad free baby sitter leaving. Sounds like fecal transplant time. Trump still final authority though. Military, law, put foot down. trump can.

edit: helped people register vote past. used help volunteer political campaigns. I'm going leave soldiers try persuade people time around internet presence even gave Census job fear catching virus. weird thing virus invisible factor, hard account definitely thrown lives chaos! think may surprised Indians second highest income earners US, they‚Äôre fine coming chain migration numbers allowed come reside restricted Report it. Especially big chains want make customers feel safe. don‚Äôt wear mask employee it‚Äôs fireable, deserve it. companies mask wearing become stupidly political lot areas, including mine. Trump wearing one shows followers it‚Äôs ok wear one, that‚Äôs good thing. highly doubt come say everyone wearing mask, really should. kind symptoms everyone start experiencing? Texas Renaissance Faire still adamant going year even though many States canceled 2020 Dude look states control proof masks help. decent defense strategy anything, virus, made layers, case mask use important layer.

A friend mine works assisted living RI mask use mandatory. coworker (a CNA) tested positive

Masks fucking work. 100% effective used 100% correctly matter. let perfect enemy good recognize important part comprehensive mitigation strategy. Coronavirus much contagious

The normal human coronaviruses quite contagious. SARS MERS not. Neither influenza, really.

- Yes, actually is. Much SARS 1 version MERS, especially since mutation. mention it‚Äôs binding ability ACE2 receptor.

No, hasn't.

- Yes, has. shown stable 33 Celsius (91.4 Fahrenheit) would room temperature. virus doesn‚Äôt show much degradation 37 Celsius (98.6 Fahrenheit).   went ER happened &amp; discharged within 5 hours getting EKG &amp; Chest Xray strangely came normal. sure counts hospitalized. 
I go ER along o2 88, heart rate 180 &amp; perfusion index 0.2. literally feeling like dying heart failure &amp; lung collapse time. loss human life regardless wore mask tolerated.

Our compassion go towards real victims took proper precautions, cared fellow humans, still fell victim virus. Yeah shit 

Local chinese embassy pretty adamant covid. Maybe corruption lead inadequate pcr tests? January. excuse. cheat game, cant cheat Covid like Eastern District NY shenanigans agree u/whoalulano think there's lot pro-NY astroturfing going subs people can't stupid.

January - [Risk NY State currently - [Go daily - [Risk public currently - [Focus flu, [Risk - [Not first Aww water filled bleach. Coronavirus cross mutation rabies confirmed. Another point, attempt dissuade people taking front line worker masks led politicization masks... subsequent outbreaks Florida, Texas, Arizona. 

These outbreaks lead additional deaths, also causing another mask shortage. 

Whether ""law unintented consequenses"" ""road hell paved good intentions""... either way bit us ass. true underrated comment. believe means may antibodies long still immunity means. Agreed. need doctors tell us common sense also tells us? Thanks saying this. 
People refuse wake realize reality Rent Center trump (Desantis) wants able bodied servants sacrifice life alter ignorance I‚Äôm sad correct :| least 1 expert said openly likely undiagnosed covid19, nothing concrete yet. bitten twice shy might bringing baggage this, then. One people suffering extended effects head doctor School Medicine Leeds, extremely well-respected institution one places world offer tropical medicine specialties. man question dengue malaria time faltered either.

Just anecdote invalidate well-documented experiences. sure motivation could trying invalidate experiences people never met, people lie illness mean one ever sick. Yeah, county colleges decided reopen come fall, thinking would easier keep control apply hybrid system switching online soon case identified. Worry thou students bring them. hand, local economy much depends students (housing/restaurants etc) without federal aid assistance programs housing/mortgage specifically, tarnished (already losing quarter students due international statuses). 

This could avoided competent lead within federal government. Covid-19 ravage us NY help anyone. People DYING hear them. Killing fans since 2003! Same; quit social media 8 years ago. mental health certainly improved actual infections actually like 33 million Americans????  trying know asshole would reported expressed hesitation. customer they're requiring (and county) wear mask, least wear appropriately. 

The point actions prevent overload ICUs. pray one family stroke need services people irresponsible. Oh, btw, Im conservative, doest mean dick believe science care human beings. Yea probably finally took look new daily case numbers. must familiar baseball many people gonna turn heads *Rays* player speaking up... (sorry St. Pete dudes) TN. schools open week. recently listed hot spot. federal action? Trump left states made bid equipment I'd like point much harder rig mailed-in ballot. COVID-19 could save us Trump without even killing him. Even anti-lockdown protesters never caused spike cases. East Asians ok, Asians India? question isnt received. group pays tax system, 27% entire tax burden take out. 

What received called free money. Sitting fatass bitching virus 1% mortality rate called job. left thing * turntables.... watched tube week Tom Hanks. said Rita longer level antibodies beginning. scary decrease. I‚Äôm waiting Canadian residence permit. day now... Whatever. tell people wearing masks leftists they're darker you? fuck else would know?

Who consider leftist? Democrats? They're center right corporatist neolibs measure terms poorly defined. 

We run-away case growth March April, severely tempered late may/early june, accomplished run-away case growth again. 

So, one wave, two surges? Whatever call it, we're second one. doctor friend put it, polio crisis people took vaccine even anticipating side effects, side effects would never bad paralyzed life. people posting bad faith favor us shut fuck up. holy shit that's aprox. 5% death rate. Florida sucks. Join party (virtually course). No. I‚Äôm debating claim whoever doesn‚Äôt wear mask die.

Is sub side science fear-mongering? real conversations not?

Edit: y‚Äôall rot echo chamber ya want then. I‚Äôm out.  want see Merkel Trump fist fight. love seeing strong woman give someone smack down. Except base shrinking, indifference virus really hurting elderly. votes can't afford lose, especially opponent fellow old white guy can't successfully paint socialist. assume brain short-circuiting. 40% people USA always straight ticket R zero questions asked.

Nobody switching sides. comments see reddit ‚Äúyeah know bunch people switched‚Äù bots astroturfers trying convince win generate complacency. Hence Trumpvirus Better ventilation.  makes perfect sense. daily new cases hit time high - open everything like we've defeated election. people generally intelligent rationalize wearing one since die right away so. 3 deaths america, really low, low. lowest numbers anywhere world. presumes virus discriminates doesn‚Äôt. Whoever‚Äôs goes taking people them.  I'm gonna point wrong. account people gotten either recovered passed away it. gonna 1 100 people meet. like 1 250-300 people meet. still pretty low number anywhere near bad. fair, 100% mask compliance hard observe apartment day. throwing shade like staying apartment day bad, house day, think lot people *think* everyone right thing, people get much. Reports said Universal better job Disney far. would accused trying profit pandemic! best time plant tree... Yeah can‚Äôt pick choose. put people elevated risk. encourages non protestors take riskier behavior. ‚ÄúIf politicians marching protestors can‚Äôt go parents funeral?‚Äù It‚Äôs rule can‚Äôt diseases don‚Äôt like highly transmissible deadly. quickly run people infect instead competed strands aren‚Äôt deadly transmissible. second wave Spanish flu Spanish flu. hadn‚Äôt infected many people disappeared summer returned fall people weren‚Äôt prepared spread much rapidly. wasn‚Äôt new strand deadly original. 

Organisms genes protect experiencing constant mutations, parses it‚Äôs replicated dna terminate replications detects mutation, typically evolves trying protect malignant cancer well complications much mutation. Viruses rule never protections causing mutate way often. one exception coronaviruses. much stable viruses. Small superfluous mutations still happen frequently significant ones happen way less frequently. Studies shown particularly true strand Basically they're commting 'doublethink' George Orwell's 1981 book describes. People still allowed travel state state nonessential activities!? That‚Äôs crazy!! Imagine spike one state bunch people leave try escape spike spike moves another state...  Nah. photo op pretend cares vets much. Patrick Ptak, spokesman Ducey, said statement: ‚ÄúOur hearts go family loved ones Mark Anthony Urquiza. know nothing fully alleviate pain associated loss, every loss virus tragic.‚Äù 

One death tragedy; 132,995 (as July 10), statistic. Look face mask different everyone else... like two scoops ice cream trump bullshit.

I bet come specific mask actually thinnest possible fabric gives protection whatsoever air passes freely it. Essentially pantyhose material continue mouth breathing without issue pretending he's complying. It‚Äôs also commentary ridiculous (USA) leadership is...also live AZ see buffoon leadership personally well. tell responds seriously pandemic mandates masks expands testing v0te him. 

We won‚Äôt, someone tell that. going demonstrate reason wasn‚Äôt coming? hope starts wearing often watch followers backtrack wearing biggest issue years research look back on, couple months.

We know long term effects long term immunity reach long term. Right thing know works quarentined, social distance, contact tracing, masks Depends state. Striking even union states could lead license suspended. teachers really don‚Äôt want go back probably quit. 

Source: teacher would stup... oh God sounds like something job would do. homeless person afford university? Grandchildren enrolled costs lot. **golf claps**  virus ain‚Äôt much killer man.

Edit: y‚Äôall saying whoever doesn‚Äôt wear mask die? Cuz uhh, that‚Äôs previous comment stated. see open mouth see slugs snails slither out. get British Columbia too? 

I‚Äôd prefer use known safety measures issues. after, thanks.

The amount folks think done live insane. I‚Äôm interested getting sick. shits like completely insane alternate reality months long movie Canadian brain. 

I'm also starting wonder living simulation people running became bored decided unleash complete insanity uninstalling it.

This can't real? Well then, come stay woods, ok? Pack in, pack out. sound sociopathic... also viewpoint many, *many* people Florida, including many healthcare workers. 


Also, welcome.

It's strange, though. Many people thanking service since started. know, sounds odd me... I'm thing I've always done, there's pandemic now. masks protect others protect wearer. It‚Äôs human nature assume people get deserve that‚Äôs disease works. universe cold uncaring humans need look other. Funny enough, current president Mormon church used heart surgeon. Well.. good news gone. Hey, I'm reporting guy told me. blame messenger. surprised exaggerated. tell sure noticeably significantly thinner three weeks, that's worth. 

As said, I'm small, sense what's ""normal"" larger people off-- mean blows mind 200 pounds ""healthy weight"" people (and guy *way* 200 pounds), true figure 50 pounds weight lose may possible well. Things seem work bigger scale bigger people, going 300 lbs 250 lbs result serious illness fasting *seems* plausible considering amount calories takes sustain amount weight begin with. Again, idea weight started ""some large number"" saw reason believe it. physically possible, I'll take word it. guess: claim follow scientific method. ""Now enough evidence masks work, others irrationally guessing now, wrong anyway"" so. Bingo. True. Also many long-haul survivors B-cell based antibodies. Instead might T-cell based immunity, however official tests available confirm yet. herd immunity little doubtful. 
 
On top that, recover within 1-2 weeks, antibody levels seems fade months &amp; tests check B-cells memory produce antibodies next infection. 
 
Edit: typo I'm curious mask made n95 rated? wuss. Source? think that's true. wish never wears one ,so dies leaves WH.This animal flaw beyond 
Scientific research.Absolute Genetic defect. Ok, troll. Hey feel fact called hoax thousands people died? 

Does cognitive dissonance touch all? Dumbass chief finally figured huh? I‚Äôm shocked. Woah Trump finally bare minimum. took 135K+ deaths. get angry response yes realize Trump deserve blame multiple failures crisis various federal agencies, state governments, healthcare industry etc POTUS supposed set tone example responding crisis quite frankly example tone set crisis terrible. Sorry snarky. good point. lot companies finding solutions employees stay home school districts trying figure safe ways teach students smaller groups. going think outside box keep economy imploding government step help (like commenter said). heads sand going back old routine cannot way go. wearing condom banging 1000's women giving herpes man donned condom thought meant deserved praise. Usually work, young people know get parents buy another one. moral dilemma political one. sudden virus spread protests, spreads Disneyworld outdoor gathering venues. Quit promoting fear  open *only* confirmed infected? yeah, beauty comes within...

Oh god got reference. I'll explain best can. 5 us, got sick early March Atlanta. us. Fever, cough, shortness breath. Stiff neck chest pains. Sick like we've never before. thankfully never seek hospital care waited testing become available. able get tested 4/20ish became available public negative. first sickness lasted ~March 4 Around March 30, April 1 symptoms disappeared every one us. fine April May, June 1 woke sore throat runny nose turned violent cough shortness breath time BED RIDDEN. like sickness before, fatigue shortness breath. quarantined immediately scheduled tests. one us came back positive, tested negative twice. sick June 20ish, quarantined together. 2 us fully recovered (the youngest 2, aged 24/24) , mother law (the oldest, 55) also made mostly full recovery, remaining symptom nasty cough shortness breath every days. there's wife (M/F 29/29), us tested negative twice, cough, congestion, fever went away we've hit extraordinary symptoms. get super hyper alert, chest back pains. I've hallucinated times, random painful stinging legs chest. Sometimes can't catch breath sitting down, cough return twenty minutes try catch breath, leaves again. can't stand longer 2 hours, I've worked 12-16 hour shifts years. get random pains nowhere come go, along swimmy weird feeling. heard day weird hypoxia get noticed C02 exhalation matches feel I'm going get oximeter keep eye it. month sick we're kind adapting it. 

So answer question confirmed reinfection, I'm starting wonder deal pcr tests Georgia. wife caught flu times, never time. one else house gets sick flu either. us, 3+ weeks sick hell, twice 3 months. one us popped positive 12 negatives rest us. Something adding up. fact really write caps absolutely kill me? ‚ÄúI MUST MAKE STUPIDITY BIG POSSIBLE!‚Äù O'Doyle Rules! That's almost total number cases Belgium one day. get twice. recorded reinfection yet.  nothing comfortable w/ Trump.. they'll bend take whatever gives them.. write title language lol right..young adults.. still places described incubator. Imagine president said: ""We need open schools, health welfare families. we're consultation leading health experts also governors local leaders across country. addition we're speaking allies friends around world reopened schools safely learn experiences build them. administration stands ready provide guidance assistance needed, also prepared get hell way we're needed. America, children, families, country.""

Instead literally get ""Open schools I'll cut funding!"" Thank you! 

For us want everyone put mask get with, need high mighty this. Sure worn mask sooner pushed mask usage. Bottomline is, whatever (or anyone else matter) matter anymore. way situation us work together, wear masks, social distance, move on. 

Thise wear, even refused wear masks, admit fault. instead fighting them, lets move on, accept whatever happened get wear masks now. Continuing badger people get dig deeper anti mask movement.

Again, lets thankful wearing mask now. Maybe many ""anti maskers"" also see light. Lets mask gatekeepers, happy wearing move on. wonder backside mask orange make up? one area Reddit seems ignoring science. wonder maybe it‚Äôs age disposition average redditor. would guess around 20 somewhat introverted, preferring virtual learning.

I‚Äôm interpreting as:

More contagious = easier spread. mutation could increase viral load increase viral shedding.

More infectious = virus better getting entry cell claiming left masks president finally people asking months end one time hospital. every year. years know what's going hit they're guessing vaccine, often wrong. sometimes know enough time create vaccine sufficient quantities flu hits. years, everybody faces flu *no* vaccine available.

I think 'herd immunity' equates 'never get virus'... means 'don't die virus'. looks like base killing themselves. Statistically. Republican Governors following trumps advice seeing cases. Look it. literally killing followers. Trump convincing followers kill themselves...preach party I‚Äôll sit watch, dumb fuck. Good thing us trust scientists you.

All show concern (even pretended). say he's worried people, make masks mandatory. anyone (democrats) would argued forcing people wear masks, accuse wanting kill Americans, unpatriotic, traitors. 

Even bungled response, delayed testing, late inexisting lockdowns way-too-early re-openings, could blamed virus. again. Say wants protect people's health well finances, careful re-openings combined mandatory mask wearing. 

His cult would done whatever asked parroted words. 

The democrats go good faith masks.

And end, matter happened, excuse facing pandemic similar Spanish Flu, something seen 100 years.

Your point fully ignores whole entire thesis socioeconomic theorists Marx Keynes. America access immense resources (as seen recent ability provide dole flood stock market cheap credit). Illinois teacher here. Union shit us communicating acceptable plan all. democratic governor hear union ""uwu thanks governor working us"" plan inclusive enough special education early childhood populations. wish way strike union, admin would field day that. I'm disappointed missed slam-dunk. Could ordered us home 8 weeks, pushed rent mortgage amnesty. Paid us grand week going down, shut whole fucking thing quickness. could given heartfelt speech star-spangled face mask, begged us come together common cause, full Roosevelt.

Could lived dreams. Authoritarian hero, winner war covid, shocking rise polls, second term, Dems trounced calls reasoned response.

Instead, Trump, say fucking moron, kind guy sees neighbor watering lawn, sets fire make guy look bad. appreciate you!  unsure, know 99% viruses body defeats get period time. think presidential seal printed depends too? ok churros back think *all* quit. think needs tell America well given reports people calling reduced testing! Louisiana, 7-8% ""decided cases"" (either completely recovered died) resulted deaths. That's terrifying. Ya know think I‚Äôm gonna sit one /s Still, divergence reactions left country‚Äôs prominent epidemiologists wrestling deeper questions morality, responsibility Catherine Troisi, infectious-disease epidemiologist University Texas Health Science Center Houston, studies Covid-19. When, wearing mask standing edge great swell people, attended recent protest Houston supporting Mr. Floyd, sense contradiction tugged ‚ÄúI certainly condemned anti-lockdown protests time, I‚Äôm condemning protests now, struggle that,‚Äù Dr. Troisi said. ‚ÄúI hard time articulating Mark Lurie, professor epidemiology Brown University, described similar ‚ÄúInstinctively, many us public health feel strong desire act accumulated generations racial injustice,‚Äù Dr. Lurie said. ‚ÄúBut honest: weeks before, criticizing protesters arguing open economy saying dangerous ‚ÄúI still grappling that.‚Äù

The lesson is, make fun people unconditionally support whatever ideas hold dear even goes science, take good hard look behave behave similarly.

It's totally embarrassing see many people sub always post rational comments, became completely irrational topic. someone says ""look, cause important supersedes risk"" would least respect feel point view respected. comments ""NO!

Almost cried contact told able taste olive day 11. learn person's true colours I'm old enough remember liberals telling everyone go chinatown. also remember trump shutting travel china criticized. heart failure it‚Äôs bad bad. heart pumping capacity you‚Äôd see many years slow damage (hypertension, leading heart attack etc). 

Practically, means trouble breathing (due less oxygen pumped), eating bag chips could send hospital (due salt content overwhelming fluid balance), quality life severely impacted. life expectancy also much shorter.

So yes survived Covid, also aged like 30 years more.

I‚Äôm told another thread he‚Äôs saying whole time.


Waiting quote proving it, I‚Äôm guessing won‚Äôt get one. support racist wear masks violates God given right wear masks. One first things God thought resting seventh day was, ""Americans shalt wear masks"". basically, humans can't change matter what. think mentioned Spaniards.  government duty protect keep safe healthy. media already best frighten population?

Not sure showcasing statistically insignificant segment population would *anything* aside unnecessarily frightening people. plenty enough people *already* over-stimulated fear (and *you* sure sound like case-in-point)... need *more* that.

FIL something causing afib low EF (I forget something crazy low like 30-40% range). Surprisingly gardening stuff, he's medication seem perkier.

Either way, lower EF cause really bad problems including higher risk stroke. 40-45% good news.

Hey, good job, POTUS! üëç week ago, Republican leadership even Hannity turned corner said mask wearing necessary. Trump said it. Pence said it. McConnell said it. Hannity said it.

Bold move cotton let's see pays good news they're joking. bad news joke based republican response disasters liberal areas. Meh, communists not. Asia governments hesitate give anti mask protesters beatings. Well completely expected since minorities mostly ones going protest.

Yeah understand. Well see then. Fox news literally ads saying wear masks. actual hosts shows telling people wear masks. Maybe simply missed know. see people cramming chains near me. Imagine risking life eat fucking Chili's even worse that. many people dying diagnosed anything. Quite (ie thousands people) dying home, never seen doctor. know death toll next year, look excess death.  I'm favor punishing idiots, especially knowingly harmful things.

I said say again: US puts way much emphasis religion. Heck, average american puts importance religion average Iranian. Imagine subbed r/MaskSkepticism people dropping dead every turn corner economy going shit.

So I‚Äôm supposed terrified unproven potential side effects virus....when 40% people don‚Äôt even realize infected symptoms???

I think post-COVID syndromes rare probably linked comorbidities. Thats I'm thinking, new daily record 0430? thats case going rough day like watching two bots learning meme me, y‚Äôall! They‚Äôll send right Santa Ana river directly riverside. It‚Äôll wonders morale! would say fair enough.  
But, thing. least... interpretation.  
We're told stay home. communication we're receiving is, ""If want go wear mask"". gives impression safe long comply wearing mask.  


The restaurant example following every guideline set forth CDC. Guidelines deemed safe.  
If truly safe. need fully shut again.  
If safe certain guidelines adhere to. Adhere guidelines make sure people well. people feel law unjust, actively break it.

End conversation bad faith rather knowing meant US Sweden similar look total mortality ‚ÄúWe could saved lot Swedish lives, eh, much effort. Better somewhere average. Let Vietnam look awesome instead.‚Äù think good shut states completely down. would create even economic disruption, eventually cost lives well. Selective shut downs hotspots, contact tracing compliant population (social distancing wearing masks) way go. quarantine nonperishables use sponge wash bagged produce sealed perishables. Lysol wipes odd shaped items containers perforations making difficult properly wash sink. Probably best way I‚Äôd totally wipes otherwise. Pff, work says continue working results pending. positive stop coming date positive result, averaging 7-10 days get.

Best part: policy states return work 7 days showing symptoms also fever 72 hours. time frame based test collected, get results. negative test needed return work. admin tell stay home day get positive result, state symptoms fever report back work following day... Yeah get load guy ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt safe‚Äù. Like dying covid air conditioned room safer. Twitch ban them. It‚Äôs memes. learn use memes. fighting fire fire.

U NUMBER 111!1!1111!1!111111! Well, suppose reason falling Rt? 

I would guess sometime around 5th March UK identified first positive case country, people freaked out, started wearing masks, slowed social activity, etc. I‚Äôm exactly sure timeline actions UK, remember Boris Johnson insisting going try lockdown, numbers got staggeringly high changed mind late. you‚Äôre using UK metric lockdowns don‚Äôt work ‚ÄúUK locked worse Sweden.‚Äù know flu pandemic 1919 late lockdown useful lockdown. graphs confirm conclusion. Really? understand think risk infection higher subway park?

When stories end? represent debilitating mental disability almost bad COVID-19 itself. UK however, culturally conditioned make fuss, stand out, like strangers looking us, feel...shame inadequate happens. yes, feeling overrides understanding masks save lives. 

I dont get one all. Germany, Korea etc people wearing mask precisely dont want stand looked negatively. No. Long term, heart failure progressive disease. get worse, better. definitely exist, multiple times many infections begin with. whole country, necessarily. areas hospitals starting get overwhelmed due exponential spread COVID-19, likely true, hospitals longer able provide best possible care patients. really understand this. heard country (vietnam) passenger get result within day. possible ? Y'all hear Wayfair shipping children rugs shower curtains? Kids might placed care parents prioritizing personal feelings children's health care emergency.

Treatment child's broken arm delayed guy wants make point wearing mask. UK. Obviously it‚Äôs ideal, least better full school back. means teachers go much smaller classes making social distancing bit achievable, essential workers still go work. It‚Äôs perfect solution opinion isn‚Äôt particularly fair teachers (my mum sister situation), schools going open, it‚Äôs better option letting everyone come back once. scary me. CHF EF 29-30% 19 year old male. Granted, due failure aortic mitral valves. open heart surgery Cleveland Clinic (bless them), proper meds, 4 years later EF 54-55%. really want go path again.

HOWEVER, read blood clots COVID. replacement valves mechanical warfarin years now. got going Dumb fucks gonna Dumb reguardless Damn, totally going say that. Luckily, patients beds need cars.

I dunno, seems like might help little. kids might like would definitely fit in. Nobody, show 28 pieces evidence OP's 2 pieces evidence. Yes recommend even wearing one home like Texas now. much spread household spread. people household leaving house things, higher chance someone bringing home spreading everyone household know it. talking hair private parts? lost track here. True, desperate make sure news people stop paying attention Roger Stone. Nobody ever given crap wearing mask, say ""I work patients."" That's all. lie, everybody know patient. food supply built based demand. one runs sudden takes full burden, prepared do. takes significant amount time scale support population.

The positive situation huge interest growing food. difficult get seeds supplies. experiment know outcome. Also know outcome yet call experiment, actually trick.

What presidential disaster. plot thickens. I‚Äôm pretty sure plot also coughing too. doctor degree learned great deal body already. learned much valuable knowledge actual experience clinical personal believe much education wasted trivial knowledge. know fully well immune system works disagree modern medicine approaches healing health.

I also recognize much research tends biased generally funded entity stands gain financially.

I already aware research done blood types virus found useless less.

Modern medicine fails recognize body whole analyzing treatment. Things broken thought isolated ailments processes. modern approach make things needlessly complicated need many instances way simple many others.

Often times part body compromised, due stress placed upon parts. low back pain example, often cause actual pain located low back rather originates calves areas.

Doctors trained think way though often times fail identify true cause main aches pains. taught isolate run tests tests. origin pain look though, taught look deeper deeper area chief complaint without considering areas ever find cause? failing modern approach. Also teachers need insurance bills children feed. leaders thrown us wolves. awful around. buddy Brazil isn‚Äôt feeling hot Yes idiots stay fuck home. bad enough people go proper cause endanger themselves, religion practised home well False positives false negatives problem individual serological test, population studies. know rates mathematically correct raw numbers arrive true prevelance.

I agree useful individuals. North Korea it. even coronavirus! Beware reporting people. Make sure write talk anonymously much detail need.

Someone company reported management wearing masks (they believe democrat hoax) management knows are. Contagious doesn‚Äôt matter even effected us, still wouldn‚Äôt steal years life span time motor vehicle accidents.

The US 36,000 traffic fatalities per year. average age death car crash? 38. Sound right? According actuary tables, average motor vehicle mortality steals 39.7 years life. So, 36,000 per year x 39.7 years 1,429,200 years life taken per year US motor vehicle accidents. 

Now, average covid-19 death? average age someone dying covid-19 78-81. Let‚Äôs use 79. Actuary tables show average 79 year old 8.4 years life left, covid-19 disproportionately affects already sick, ones dying covid-19 likely lower end figures cohort. odds dying covid-19 given age roughly par odds dying cause within one year age, likely average covid-19 victim year left lifespan, let‚Äôs generous say 4.2 years left average. puts years lost far due Covid US 570,650. 

Time tell future holds, even got it, time would take happen, still wouldn‚Äôt likely take much life motor vehicle accidents. Exactly! Adding bed slapping sheet going cut it. need experienced, critical care trained, health care professionals care patients ICU beds. government say mean offices reopen advice, example, work told us week work home least October. Assuming second wave, pretty likely back office 2021, regardless government advice *If* herd immunity ever occur naturally.

Treatment improved lot recent months, i.e. fewer fatalities, less people hospitals shorter stays hospitals. also better knowledge anti-epidemic measurements. countries could lift lock-down little ill effect. Protective equipment testing equipment longer short supply. Sweden still infections fatalities peers, i.e. higher risk second wave. idiot 4 months late. could minority communities lot essential workers gotten adequate protection virus. watched C-beams glitter dark near Tannhauser gate! That's one aspect. force think needs prepared everyday problems. 

I 48 hour bag car. call ""get home bag"". use constantly. working job site away home last year got call family member hospitalized city working. able drive straight hospital stay rest family could come. change clothes, fully charged battery phone, extra Cliff bars (I ended eating them, first hours really time go cafeteria). Right lmao. ‚ÄúCovid ain‚Äôt gonna stop living life‚Äù. Proceeds go chilis. Americans lived stereotypes sure. UK highest deaths per 100,000 people world? feel like that's still great.. Yes, peer reviewed, however recent meta-analysis IFR, gives number credibility [CDC's current best IFR 0.65%, uses study source number. always find amazing many news talk paper place single link it... source says hard actually say anything increase since young people protesting likely show symptoms everyone admits protest. moment isnt concrete evidence protests increasing infections, like said something keep mind fair, large number Americans accept saying follow recommendations. problem current administration holds significant influence constituent base. seen few... million... bad apples trigger exponential degrade public health.

I actually hope Fauci goes somewhere embrace leadership experience offer resources needs advance knowledge virus fast possible. Arizona great tacos. tits. Well, looks worrying. get Kevin Rudd instead?

Oh, wait... Kevin Rudd studied there, speaks Chinese fluently... someone wears mask roughly 8 hours day, get used mask (few weeks me) less stop ""i can't breathe"" feeling much. nurse wearing chin mask anyone good... better wearing point probably touching outside mask over, causing get even germs hands spreading faster she'd worn mask begin with. Honestly gets Americans wear masks spin whatever story want everywhere? betcha! mind stay closed another five years. Presumably, someone highest bidder would someone needs it? And, bidding implies enough go around everyone needs it. So, enough everyone needs it, decide gets it? Look Cimexa. Safe lungs pets. Dries roach (and bed bugs) outer layer crisp till they're dehydrated die. friends come eat spreads like colony. good 10 years placed untouched. Put inside wall sockets (like take cover go wall way), corners, baseboards, anywhere holes usually untouched like behind fridge. volunteering, though, random sampling. would take results grain salt comes out. Sweden undoubtedly fucked up, understand point OP trying make, headline completely correct. including countries worse Sweden, mean exist theory wouldn‚Äôt wear mask early thought would made fun looking stupid wearing it. Like Mike Dukakis tank helmet. honestly, looks like actual leader taking threat seriously. Wearing mask might even help politically point, thought opposite true months ago. Give them, mental health important  county 385 icu beds, 30% COVID related.  Good news really do. Works especially well call local news folks. mean get payed vs. level education?

Regardless, still replied source comment edited original comment ""thank them"" called out. Add chapped arse comment almost like cared little source, can't handle called out. Testing

Edit: literally wrote word testing context see I‚Äôd get downvoted üòÇ. could easily meant ‚Äúwe need testing better testing‚Äù article said Arizona dog shit testing. cant even call children I've seen children wear masks without complaining 55+ year old white men. Awesome, two eight week delay finally dropped, unfortunately note said going numbers arrive. Oh three four times work... least. do. think point US started downward spiral 9/11.
I can't believe much damage airplanes buildings inflicted used leader world.

What's SAD people take oaths lightly abuse power trust granted them. What's SAD ever see inside prison cell damage they've done. remote work, then? long America going virus? 

Between actually find cure, test it, manufacture it, distribute it, get past anti vaxxers, daily cases still hitting new records every day..

..how many going die next months/years? honestly feel blessed live country handled properly.  Democracy?

It help lot older romance ""hero gets girl"" movies contain ""yes means no"" trope. perfectly family-friendly films 30 years ago would seen absolutely sexist released today. guess covid eventually prove world probably roll along without americans then. everyone less opened up, selected countries banned, u still powerhouse money? reddit, disagree anything upvote hivemind says youre nazi idiot sexist racist white supremacist conspiracy theorist brainlet. Arizona close states did? Thank mentioning trauma. one talking traumatic would kids sent back school.

No one learning age Covid. can't learn worry everyone love care dying. amount reopening change that. going catch kids over. sucks, alternative. wear mask protect others sickness, demand others wear clothes protect sensibilities thank Donald trump politicizing public health. Funny thing is, he‚Äôs trying convince people care COVID gets re-elected. doesn‚Äôt actually give shit yokels research stop, temporarily stopped giving new patients. places started right back retraction No. pressure Disney needs threat losing money makes reopening. isnt unrealistic.

But people internet say pointless basically nothing, makes little unrealistic.

I'd wait, that's me. You‚Äôre making several mistakes.
There three mortality rates: 

1) Infection Fatality Rate
2) Case Fatality Rate.
3) Population Mortality Rate.

Assuming really mean infection fatality rate, you‚Äôre making mistakes:

1) Deaths lag infections 4 weeks.
2) You‚Äôre cherry picking single country looking Singapore.
3) You‚Äôre ignoring unrecorded deaths
4) try look fatality rates, disease normalize least age. I.e. it‚Äôs possible less half many people dying U.S., cases younger. change infection fatality rate. always look age cohort, recalculate back general population based age distribution country question.

I.e. experts stating U.S. Infection Fatality Rate 0.5% 1.2%. Leave stuff like experts, don‚Äôt try calculations. even news. f trump Democrats Conservatives 2: Electric Boogaloo Coronazona. problem ultra rich whether make money not. whether economic system still functions. Yup, shit isn‚Äôt going end well, fuck it. mouse needs money shareholders!! Beijing then. There's horse hospital. Help us Yes, big spread, probably bigger neighbours. yes, might done ‚Äùbetter‚Äù counties. 

But lets honest. compare worst class? lot bad rhetoric Swedens strategy actually makes valid criticisms hard get through. 

Yes, decline important metrics last week follows trend going weeks. army contact tracers? hotels and/or quarantine facilities beeing set up? spread even lower end July, solid plan place? hope Im seeing national scale.

Also, Im bit tired argument elderly homes. Everyone knew lots quality related issues regarding those. investigations inquiries pointing this. Still seemed like blind spot response late. Beeing aware issues taken heavy consideration working strategy. Saying talking isn‚Äôt good enough. 

We need actively take charge. far, passive. chance take action stunt growth real. alternative continious outbreak flare time time fall winter.

In end, didn‚Äôt failure leadership measures. systematic failure needs corrected. dont think people realize much saved local hospitals, started ramping ICU capacity secured PPE way authorities woke up. One example bad coordination fact Karolinska started using cortisone steroids soon March success, wasnt conveyed hospitals region Stockholm even, certainly parts Sweden.

We need change. way getting seeing things were. I'm person maybe mean countries done well let guard much there's potential tears countries. think countries low counts stick hard contact tracing probably ok though. Check comment little thread. going get us herd immunity...

Probably possible virus. Trying get us millions killed though. one voting comment live Utah. They'll show specific clips BLM protests without mask group Democrats that. Dem want destroy American government, abolish police, spreading disease kill Americans. you‚Äôre moving work, job cover part moving expenses

If you‚Äôre moving result personal choice, cover it. can‚Äôt so, that‚Äôs you. Ill mad problem 28 years lol. cant imagine finding easy solution time time realizing cant eat shit love anymore. fuck get downvoted hard? Oh, yes, CCP‚Äôs little sluts jobs (if that‚Äôs call them), aren‚Äôt they. 

We‚Äôll thinking depression hits, girls. Specifically you. least America GREAT /r/SelfAwarewolves Find park, busk said park, leave money cases days spending think reason teachers get lot focus pay education ratio highly skewed. asymptomatic yet also blood/organ complications come covid? go moment, deny people health care get sick, doctors nurses treat people want treat based freedoms?? people refuse wear masks time expect medical care time need get sick covid. BREAKING NEWS: President Complies Laws. 11. Well remembered theory tha Anglo-Saxon Sickness attenuated virus changed population.

A lot ""optimists"" COVID-19 still acknowledge known immunological characteristics like MHC- ACE2 locking unlocking mechanism. one done anything vitro T-cell apoptosis study. even know virus infecting macrophages cells.

We know pretty conclusively long term symptoms occuring dismissed make medical sense (not consistent anything medical history). Fauci thrown bullshit inflammation post-flu fatigue syndromes. No! People fevers recurrent coughs, breathing problem, well fatigue. 

The virus immune system still active battling months.

That weird troubling sign far going inside cells properly discussed.

The ongoing comparison virus common cold coronaviruses, even SARS, comparison, nuts.

This virus acting like rabies SARS. husband's co-workers ""online happy hours""...everyone seems greatly enjoy it! someone family murders home, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs government‚Äôs responsibility bring person killed in? 

I mean, guys home. again, isn‚Äôt government‚Äôs fault. could leave be, murder someone else family home. since isn‚Äôt responsibility government. 

If it‚Äôs illegal, reported, nothing done yes it‚Äôs systemic. Heard airborne transmission? level stupidity shocking states release inmates virus advocate putting people back virus? Now, lets see often picture posted, see right.... media waiting mask, cause look bad mask. I'm guessing mask less people ones inventing flying cars say? Let's see, someone callously ignores valid scientific evidence actively puts lives risk can't bothered *one, tiny, super easy* thing like wear mask sometimes? 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, yes consider someone like inferior. are, actions CLEARLY prove they're inferior others willing 'mask up'. Anti-maskers *should* fined wearing masks, they're showing inferiority, *because lives put risk.* would problem anti-masker? Yes: Yes, are. like purge. 60% stupidity instead 100% violence hate. Low oxygen levels would cause brain fog, fatigue difficulty concentrating... wearing mask like physco time maybe? better hindsight. news president wears mask. cell responses akin observed context successful vaccines, suggesting natural exposure or
infection **may** prevent recurrent episodes **severe** COVID-19 also seronegative individuals.

But want even chance immunity, accept organ damage seen studies mild asymptomatic cases. get get mild cases second time, organ damage. I'm pretty sure that's sarcastic comment although apparently nobody seems realize it.. I'm trying manipulate, make point. headlines subreddit (or general internet) built cherry picked data. 

All headlines Sweden covid especially dishonest lacking consider many variables issue extremely hard compare, even impossible now. 

I made point headline factually complete true data considered. consider whole picture? course not. 

This argument apply many things, covid-19. actual number likely quite higher. take away vigilance. Left unchecked, virus kill millions bring public health system collapse. impact people diseases, since won‚Äôt enough doctors, medicines beds care everyone. 
Also, virus likely return fall. summer made tamer leading less serious infections. would thought place dozens children (who probably understand social distancing) stay close proximity acting like squirrels caffeine overdose actually perfect environment covid 19... Page = unavailable. inexcusable  They're lot waving video, ain't hello, ""goodbye, sucker!"" Yea, tanker bad example, agree. Least Obese state gang let's fast forward vaccine comes out

those refuse wear masks managed stay alive likely refuse vaccinated ""they've gone far without masks/vaccines"" We're comparing US Europe, we're comparing ARIZONA Europe. Arizona near case peak. Europe almost gone entirely COVID-19 life-cycle trailing end. snapshot comparison two, even without populations taken consideration, absurd. populations taken account (i.e., deaths per million), even absurd. Victoria Australia 273 new cases... whole state back lockdown one travel Victoria states. seems bad us Australians. Lord help USA. Yea that's thinking actually slightly Saturday. Democrats liberals say it‚Äôs good listen smart educated people... republicans us proving don‚Äôt need educated peoples telling us exercise constitutional rights. /s I‚Äôm sorry, wearing BLACK MASK?!?!

(I actually heard early news Fox reporter comment Biden ‚Äúblack mask‚Äù equivalent blackface) I'm trying manipulate, make point. headlines subreddit (or general internet) built cherry picked data.

This argument apply many things, covid-19. Thank you, knew getting into, amount people get angry really surprising saying 60 times awesome EU -Arizona Morona government probably.  half Reddit users actually [outside difference EU countries actually locked fully opened back up. Disneyland Paris opening next week. Perfect example types events **banned** country. 

When allow happen, hand responsibility attendees comply regulations right thing.......they won't. 

**This** need government step literally ban things shut things down. Human beings stupid right thing follow recommendations. forced stay home given chance go places masks social distancing strictly enforced. didn‚Äôt say that. heard news ‚Äòthe people don‚Äôt want experts‚Äô / ‚Äòwobbling flesh puppet‚Äô Gove. don‚Äôt understand he‚Äôs allowed speak publicly every time does, sounds rudderless.

Even though I‚Äôd say 50/50 yesterday it‚Äôs like 40/60 today. aren‚Äôt nearly enough masks honestly see likely issue couple weeks. Particularly shops run older people. Personally I‚Äôm absolutely happy wear mine shops science says otherwise. Disappointing see lack patience really. could potentially knock vulnerable Sorry ask copy paste comment already made: asked brain damage mean guess post kind answer. hell... america... rich treasured peasants love them. (Was going say sarcasm...but ot seems true. :( ) tell anti maskers mask absolutely illegal. 

Complying (and wearing) following government. complying (and wearing) infer previous action idiotic. Ya kids life ruined. know kids abused system, right? friend molested multiple foster homes. anyone wondering:

51k deaths involving COVID-19 pneumonia specifically excluding influenza. 

The CDC number deaths involving COVID-19 119k.

Different link source total number excess deaths since 2/1/2020 united states as: 115k - 159k

If look excess deaths explicitly remove COVID-19 19k-48k.

That puts excess deaths associated COVID-19 67k-140k

So OP found official source looked 3-5 different numbers LOWEST possible estimate COVID associated chose one. wonder why?   everybody clap, stand clap dammit. step right direction. might actually prevent deaths now. Yes no, related sense corona hit every country hard, going crisis full Brexit doubles problems economy UKs side. simply would make sense stop nonsense sides grasp Corona. Also Northeast, still think closing state borders least regional border. worked hard months threaten progress destroyed everyone NJ treated like joke.

Close borders get shit straightened out. weakened version virus stimulate antibody response help immune system 

Whoa! those? What's called, ask doctor? Sounds like brother brother go bowling together. Multiply germanys case rate death rate 5. ratio still far superior US numbers. whine underreporting 30% im telling multiply 500%.

Tbf first order stormtroopers right idea  think going fizzle like NY. We're single-digit deaths state 19M people, basically old age deaths nursing homes anyway. still get 700 new cases day, that's 1% people getting testing, hospitalizations keep going down, apparently cases severe, asymptomatic positive tests people getting tested work. pool people get sick keeps getting smaller. Soon enough people left antibodies get asymptomatic case, cases keep dwindling. big company company-wide guidelines, leaving individual managers. make title misleading? DeVos moron. That's silly. 72yo neighbor 8s bar fly Houston he's fine. ""69 19!"" love it, culture clash. 

On one side Japanese, disciplined respectful, side nation whose leader Trump.

No wander large difference infection rate. mortality rate REALLY low, there's nothing worry about! /s  talking about? statistics wrong. highly infectious disease. case numbers rising exponentially, number hospitalizations deaths. know chance someone spreading virus - 1% number made up.

Furthermore, focusing ONE person. Well, lets thinks hundreds thousands millions people would wearing masks mandated. Think that. Even ""chance"" one person spreading virus x%...multiply million!! would lot virus spread masks mandated. 

Your last comment purely idiotic. legal ramifications mandated...you harming 99% normal people??? nothing harmful??? What?? Many people wear masks, stupidest lowest IQ people generally uneducated, not. make 99%. collectively, damage people wearing masks significant. handful super spreaders, could end impacting THOUSANDS people. understand one person infects multiple people person infects multiple people one person could end infecting hundreds people wearing mask. 

Reporting people wearing mask way presume guilty spreading virus. complete utter bullshit. Everyone knows wear masks, virus not. nobody knows it, . Everyone aware that. 

No, people absolutely likely guilty forgetting masks. That's funny. Yes, people legitimately forget masks. makes people. AND, many many businesses either give away door one time use masks available purchase!! everywhere!! businesses even walk inside get one, tell person front. buy gas station. create make shift face covering something car! lot ways deal ""forgetting"" mask. vast majority people forget mask, though, could easily get replacement. reason can't, go home public.

The vast majority people either wearing mask wearing chin nose...don't believe masks. want wear them. late nuke Florida? Unfortunately I've seen anything like follow /r/COVID19 religiously. Politics needs society bigger virus.

&amp;#x200B;

Open schools, virus spread one issue society has. New Yorkers, hold beer \~Florida man, 2020 mean states get federal funds got ya. trust Russia? apparently tested safety.

Edit: got get idea lowers immune system causes cardiovascular issues?  


Good luck telling trans people stop taking hormone treatments. Many would rather die Covid-19 disconnected something feel makes lives worth living. can't nice things like universal healthcare. mentality always fuck cos I'm healthy want anyone sick getting tax money health.... one getting screwed hospital bills. Taking medical interventions like hormone therapy sugeries lowers immune system response.

Not judging would imagine trans people would higher risk. They'll care video Trrump ventilator admitting bad. He'd never though. grandparent uncle/aunt dies they'll find excuse write another reason sick anyway. tendency uhhh... rape say understand worked Americans want benefits without putting work. Years poor investment education we're spot are. think Florida expanded testing capacity. I'm pretty sure positivity rate skyrocketing right now. holy shit barreling straight flu season too. whole point get clamped control summer weren‚Äôt dealing flu season. point US Governement going accused held accountable purposedly killing citizens? Oh wait... Schools colleges open fall, everyone wearing masks, course. also option want stay home. Warning possible danger irresponsible... denying possibility danger evidence isn't? Misleading title!

This list mix demographics symptoms. Source please?

-A well meaning college professor saw coming. Depressing. Impossible. wear masks [I know would say ""exact stay safe act like need get N95 fitted like taking measurements tuxedo. definitely 'useless', even letting small amount unfiltered air in. Congrats NJ. Let's keep down! Yeah.

There article recently said adding antigen tests mix realize - tho always think testing numbers tests given *new* tests.  new Yorker... barely see ANYONE without mask. building still enforces 2 people max per elevator. Idk man nyc changed place, see someone saying distancing wearing masks blows mind. feel like, point, US looking closing state borders. People say unconstitutional seen direct evidence that. Australia (Victoria &amp; NSW) currently curb spread much smaller numbers. China done sealing Hubei early days. say it'll detrimental, that's certainly one way approach problem instead taking zero action. Right one knows sure. B-cell based antibodies seem fade away few(6-8) months. T-cell based memory cells retain immunity long time(10+ years), tests confirm yet. way, day cases much slower weekend, undercount. Yes no. depends arnt getting tested. also fast getting infected. happens fast hospitals run people need care get it. mortality rate goes way up. Also many unknowns covid worth getting. starting learn potential longterm negative health effects like reduced lung capacity cognitive capacity. know dont care either rest life. I‚Äôm trying point people. reddit wingman please Lol hit hard nursing homes. Never equated anything like NY, NJ That‚Äôs uh, really disappointing. I‚Äôm guessing need long term studies shit, major bummer cannot good news vaccine researchers... today? Like day hasn‚Äôt even ended yet. Maybe teacher day Covid hotspot school starts back fall. Red America even worse China comes covering truth.

I would trust even Xi Jinping Ron DeSantis. 

The reason America overall less corrupt China Blue America. Northeast West Coast seceded America would become like Turkmenistan. Only? 900 still alot people. need remember numbers people people people love do. I'd gladly give people work reddit home absolutely full shit. 

Essential jobs stay need done enforced much stricter way. 


Salons, casinos, retail, restaurants, gyms, malls, zoo's, beaches businesses need shut like Europe fucking every competent country done deep are. shut world stop turning? No. Things worse government failing lead. obviously taken stance ride die die. hospitals get overcrowded fucked come flu season. perfect storm could brewing lot people may die. 


Please dont attitude everything needs turning humanity continue. 

Having attitude makes part problem. 

And fuck reddit means family go work risk getting sick everyday. half people arent even following simple precautions like wearing mask. 


Shut let's ride germ winter. [My reaction  keep defending WHO. director-general said media briefing March: 
 influenza, people infected yet sick major drivers transmission, appear case COVID-19.    basically force children go back school, parents forced go back work middle mismanaged pandemic. Yeah around 14/15. even know vaccine it, I'm going look getting that. It‚Äôs wild, surprising unfortunately. think less distance simply people plane. industry can't keep going turn profit flying lower capacity. Everyone oh fuck airlines bandwagon everyone needs fly point pick poison. Crazy expensive flights less options future middle seats. Oh, catch part interview couple responsible folk going self-quarantine next two weeks... said they've gotten plane standing airport talking reporter likely catch taxi uber get public transport? hope take time vote coming election God bless America. America worked hard keep people
out country basically treated like plague Wrong.

Coronaviruses general known tendency [generate waning That's one reasons ""common cold"" common.

Occam's razor would suggest variant coronavirus different others also likely generate waning immunity.  Jade Helm? feel like we're page still arguing lol. states people justify reopening things stay closed ""social distance"" tables /desks etc 6ft apart. seems agree based sneeze premise, dont think method transmission also agree viral aerosol. states poorly (on top refusal wear masks) keeping case counts down. perhaps capacity increase much, positive rate definitely going up. ""succeeded"" Trump/his administration letting him. clear listening advice. Ron Desantis hope sarcastic. Look highest date cases highest date tests, bigger issue comparative lack testing. testing amounts went fast near daily setting records.

You'll see Florida days testing goes also sub nuked guess don‚Äôt know Arizona well üòÇ get go back normal weeks like what‚Äôs happening NY. side matey ;) What‚Äôs likely behaving like common coronaviruses, recirculating level population immunity. become thoroughly endemic, think might looking severe common cold (to immunity wanes partially reactivated upon challenge, limiting symptoms). It‚Äôll become mostly invisible parasite, basically. HKU1 silent pandemic. discovered chance Hong Kong (they thought guy SARS). started testing around world realized quite widespread. catch HKU1 once. Completely anecdotal absolutely could bunk, testosterone injections low got sick frequently ever before. . question whether safe enough gimmick?  ohwow never thoufht like thanks man It‚Äôs upvoted reminds people remain cautious relax easily something isn‚Äôt yet. Chill out, man Deaths skyrocket hospitals pushed past ability care certain amount patients. case NYC Italy. name game keeping ICU beds open battle severely losing logically would see sudden rise deaths. 

All I‚Äôm saying 15,000 people becoming infected one day could beginning huge rise death counts something think hope doesn‚Äôt happen. Surprised parents like you. I'd furious. got ~~a Republican President~~ Trump. like think even Bush would tested aggressively. *what kill makes ... weaker* No, US spend time placing mitigation measures schools lowering community transmission like countries did. America something simple treated like difficult. agree. NY stopped daily briefings June. like, WTF, yeah, people basically stopped dying this, protests still going on, places still closed, people left still living somewhere else, mask order end date criteria end. pretend normal? course not. say ""masks orders lifted antibody tests % across state"" ""when new infections go 300/day statewide"" something, people might pay attention. strategy ""what kind ass thinks hard run marathon face shield gloves,"" look clueless, change minds. Blimey! says, COVID-proof bunker, face mask plexiglass shield. hypocrite. Ghost chili powder, taken snuff, suppository, currently recommended alternative mask.

The inflammation closes avenues virus entry. Exactly, mean knows many deaths cause. It‚Äôs sad. mostly stupid, malicious. correct. mistaken. gone sub, since everyone page little productive criticism. Ugh! That‚Äôs infuriating.

My grandma currently nursing home rehab center, nurses going rooms without masks. I‚Äôve debating calling complaining, don‚Äôt know I‚Äôll give info. r/thatsthejoke think officially they're like 16% contact tracing?

It's ridiculous, either way. they'll never shut Disney even becomes cesspit COVID, one ever able prove mostly non-existent contact tracing. Also thinking it, responsible person would buy extra box disposable face masks keep car. several car. make sure bring mask would make sure bring wallet. Yes, forgotten wallet store. immediately went home get it. People approach masks way. article also points kids seeing increase multisystem inflammatory syndrome testing positive Covid.

Among blood clotting everything else it‚Äôs beyond sad can‚Äôt wait longer study virus stop using people kids lab rats. Florida's 7 day average positivity nearly 20% based current Hopkins data, they're massively scaling testing starting test wider field, would match decently recent results. days released 60k+ test results 11k+ positives. got nearly 100k 15k positives sounds like they're finally expanding testing faster disease spreading. still enough (positivity closer 5%), improvement.

The important take away would 15k positive cases 100k tests still probably means they're missing significant portion true positive cases. Yesterday 10,000, today 15,000. Last week days 11,000. What's interesting exactly FAT short murdered science! low low price 30k year. stop trump buying screaming rooftops. tested entire population single day you‚Äôd get 200,000 positives,

No wouldn't. 1% positivity rate coming sample biased towards positive results. people getting tests people likely gotten infected thus much likely report positive rest population. tested everyone, might catch truly asymptomatic carriers false positives get good chunk cases, absolutely get 200,000 positives. They‚Äôre Putin lot line here... US sucked Trump elected, ya know... odds seem shockingly low commercial airliners designed way entirely replace air board every minutes. armchair theory, would imagine plane one safer enclosed public places could virus. Safer restaurant grocery store least. going go trouble anyway wear one? people mental capacity six year old. get virus chance get permanent damage, like lungs damage, immunity? imagine good turn catch virus second time winter point Remember late 70s mid 90s next generation parents would informed able attain best knowledge raise kids physical health, mental wellness, educational pursuit mind? Well look us now, sure good portion middle class like this, top care to, bottom time so. stupid conspiracy theorists antivaxers west brain washed killing kids making good money funeral coffin companies. Plus ignorant people southern US making shit worse too. wonderful experiment epidemiology, way Russian Roulette wonderful experiment probability. explain like five years old still understand cells help immunity

I asked politely continue despite rudeness responses generally want learn I'm server increasingly feel raw visceral hatred developing people still eating risking life. pass another stimulus I'm paying utilities 6 months quitting job.  research acknowledges small study sample cases patients hospitalized. still need title. earth isn‚Äôt reddit banning subs ? ban racist subs fucking morons literally killing people okay ? ""As far know"", like ethical inclination (or time), sit bunch people around one another without masks on, expose random pre-screened 100% confirmed infected asymptomatic, wait obvious happen. reminder mayor turner actually trying getting blocked state officials. Plus - one cooperating. far I‚Äôm aware they‚Äôre one good ones Texas. herd immunity put us roughly 18 million dead anyway? young kids. Disney plus membership start quarantine helpful. cancelled couple weeks ago behaving regarding this. Frankly Netflix way better variety educational cartoons anyway. Disney shows mostly shiny distractions. Kids seem care either. Contact tracing moot takes long results come back. Look way. think exposed, right? correct way isolate 14 days, incubation period virus, get test. takes 10 days results back. That's 24 days isolation needed. many days work?

Never mind time off, let's say still unemployed living parents money whatever. know anyone selfish enough sacrifice ""fun"" weeks make sure super spreader? Nope.  crazy tests rationed though. keep hearing stories hour long lines week long delays hear people know saying company testing everyone weekly. That's true. However, also know single data point.

We're six months epidemic. immunity wanes two months one year infection? majority people would still immune now, may lose immunity coming months.

If make plans based idea immunity never wanes, we'll horrible position (or when) does. What's wrong beach? talking spring break levels...

Anyway, get running. nice chatting you. always pleasant surprise three replies still civil :) usually find happens people end agreeing points.

Have great day stay safe :) Ugh that‚Äôs excruciating. One small stores sign saying masks required, medical exemption please call curbside pickup. Idk, mental hoops people put determine masks bad...

Well course, live Florida strictly social distancing months. Literally home ocean one around.

I'm dying get out. saw tweet read something like: Florida live experiment happens lock don't. 

As I've said Florida posts, they're currently 150% highest European one day totals figure continue rise even lockdown. locking level infection tried. We're entering unchartered waters here.

How many weeks Florida Wuhan AC? Hyperbolic maybe getting bad thousands Floridians perish needlessly virus controlled sensible measures. horrifying watch America shoot face repeatedly like this. Pro sports leagues getting multiple tests every staff member day results, adding thousands tests. road, essential workers lined hours take test wait week. sound like group leaders trying get economy going again. maybe prevented damage, infection. They'd possibly spreaders though, would mean we'd really need everyone vaccinated. good comments, enjoyed reading that, reason want people virtual doctor meetings government needs pay that, want to, acceptable losses battlefield. sure Doug Ford children work part time evenings grocery stores like rest us... feels acceptable losses, family well. much life worth wonder behind closed doors??....How many dead costs much enforce pay Doctor virtual meetings?? system non-facemask accreditation.

*stamps another place cataclysm bingo card* damn shame something like happening seems way convince thinking hoax take seriously. Well bankrupt 8 companies? I've seen plenty people left wear masks. Canadian doc happened Wuhan early days. many foreign countries, diagnosed virus, even contact someone diagnosed, put mandatory quarantine government monitors make sure follow it.

In America, get positive test go bar drink sorrows away. Don‚Äôt go. worried, self isolate. It‚Äôs hard Cdc reporting 119,318 Amazing Clever. Thumbs up. Trump included. 

He's minimum mask, he's still causing detrimental scenario. staying home due sheer numbers people travel him, him, interactions happen result travel specifically. *""To exile means away one's home, either explicitly refused permission return threatened imprisonment death upon return.""*

p.s. probably good thing let make laws :) deaths going People talking badass looks. :/ doubt it. masks use medical grade still unable stop particles small SARS passing through. someone invented reusable N95 mask distributed one everyone, forced people wear 24/7 public, virus would make little headway. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs fantasy. 

The real way stop spread sustained social distancing, avoiding crowded rooms, course thorough hand hygiene. bad thing? means open floodgates print even without hyperinflation. HAHAHA.

No. covid-related would mean covid active part either directly causing death, weakening immune system enough following illness (either covid something else) led death. Like one directly dies HIV infection, die different illness weakened immune system could fight.

I think still need keep track non-covid related deaths compare previous years. Medical experts warned non-covid death rates rise hospitals occupied covid - it'll take time get data see compare last year.

I'm sad scared.  mean, SELL themed masks. Disney doesn‚Äôt give anything away free üòÇüòÇ article you‚Äôre talking next county over. Meanwhile, heated discussion store day person without mask, claimed didn‚Äôt need one Corona doesn‚Äôt exist anymore summer sun kills virus... America worlds best health care system. It‚Äôs going difficult time, faith get better countries terms death rate. 

It‚Äôs also see many cases, really ramped testing since free market society, get want. Even Trump annoyed testing much. bad, sad, doesn‚Äôt power. need adult. beginning. got best care though info many people genuinely sick virus vs asymptomatic mildly sick? can't blame based recent showings. want catch Covid instead. Wise choice... Frankly, anyone care anyway? 1% rate correct USA must 250k+ infections day one point. 21st April 2500 people day. Understanding facts science helps sleep well enough, thanks. Yeah. live Strawberry Central. Ya here. It‚Äôs actually worse ever back.. Maskhole Another one gone. 

How many going see? Like asking herd immunity HIV making everyone positive governor state mandated masks time ago. It‚Äôs still hit miss anyone wear one, half people masks noses sticking out. local sheriffs announced wouldn‚Äôt enforce mask mandate. So, yeah, it‚Äôs working. great idea. might try this. I've bored lately. Great live life bubblewrap old regeret never anything life scared everything.

But us actually want live life.  Europe's population older US, puts disadvantage. case Italy, massive outbreak caught completely guard time much testing. dead Italians elderly, live multi-generation homes, suspected younger, asymptomatic carriers may initially spread Covid older relatives. also lot embracing, hugging southern European cultures; mention much higher population densities Europe compared US. (Western Europe people US one-third landmass). I‚Äôm sick false ‚Äúboth sides X‚Äù narratives. team digging in? Seriously? 

One side saying listen doctors medical professionals follow advice side saying listen cult leader instead. 

This political one side only. Wear totally dependent densely populated going is, even cases area, among others. think (re)electing senile old man going stop US destroying itself? Soon enough, Lord Governor Farquad be. Plenty ‚Äúpoor‚Äù countries better US. ...umm virus mutated Covid-19T virus people red hair New York get it. /S  I'm worried dying, obese medically supported people need worry. ones huge burden health care system need stay inside... know sounds awful survival fittest.. getting more? thought conservative white peoples? getting airplanes fly home Fuck you. us trying. You‚Äôre going like US dismantled NHS keep us xenophobia obesity. might stupid strategy purposely wear cloth masks instead N95s reason.

The belief light exposure allow body become immune like vaccine heavy exposure get sick.

My understanding medical community debated whether that's sane strategy last century conclusion yet. Truth. name started using 2000 got passe 1998/1999.

Actually, older use, newer do, made new one since 2004 so.  ROFL, conservative minds across country blown.

They know think anymore. dear leaders giving mixed signals. I‚Äôm worried me, it‚Äôs others (immunocompromised, hypertensive, old) susceptible worry. Continuing on: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm willing give freedoms, that‚Äôs people trying make do. Americans aren‚Äôt going stay inside houses shouldn‚Äôt to.‚Äù 

I need get here. Sure. Watch us. 5g tower ban bunch fools.

Here's latest case/death charts Florida: currently 19.30 deaths per 100k I‚Äôm south Florida 95 degree weather ones bitching wearing mask. Florida wife staying kindly avoid lol, thank you.  man, I'm still gonna wipe everything. time? say Latin America peak peak? Yes, think it‚Äôs fair shocks people action saves lives. fact matter better precautions taken EU. Covid causes strokes, due blood-clotting effect has. think misunderstood me. end get virus manageable levels, like EU did. able locked effectively. ""Masks everyone"" ""no bars"" enough stop virus reaches level. much community spread. suggestion opposite quitting. ""we failed need start try again.""  repeatedly called Congress bankroll lockdowns. needs get act together start escalating brink civil unrest.

That‚Äôs sort point ‚Äúbig igloo‚Äù (aka bugaloo) movement. They‚Äôre spoiling fight. anti-mask crowd falls right lap. things ‚Äúso much worse‚Äù Arizona half many deaths per million UK? know healthy succumb anger emotion things (or things general...)

It's maddening think people monsters, always imagine victims defenceless. think they're locked space together is... Unimaginable, makes want pull ideas old testament...

Anyway sorry profanities fellow redditors. Thank God finally wore one US much bigger! /s Yeah also 60x amount people runing around streets screaming unfair life sincerely care believe not. watch like like watch. know difficult vote US? Sincerely asking. you‚Äôre going say kind stuff, least educated do. Hurry, someone tell President Obama anti-mask too.. CDC admitted number infected actually closer 20 million.

Don't forget also estimate deaths underreported. cant remember figure top head. 30%? going reply ones invalidating point going stick low hanging fruit? post dog picture /r/aww moron White House  Unfortunately prepared us another spike, saying inevitable going around country doubt bad first time

He literally said radio interview expects another spike, idk votes trials stopped due bullshit example, eventually resume retraction

source: tell day long hands ears going ""La la la la la la la la"". tinfoil hat saying lot anti-mask horseshit seeded trolling ruskies Facebook. clean doesn‚Äôt stop roaches. I‚Äôm OCD level clean, live 18th floor high rise that‚Äôs pretty new still got roaches couple years ago. immediately called exterminator, looked everywhere, couldn‚Äôt find anywhere concluded come via air vents! way 18th floor. put something air vents never saw roaches hope see worst, I‚Äôm really sorry deal this. Armchair expert here.

Not time year. What's called anal fuck someone without condom on, (or he's) got bits shit there, clean first, intact (not circumsized) man shit like, clump foreskin like balls poop? That's Trump's face usually. they're clearly lying death numbers places like Texas Florida, almost three times many cases Canada half deaths. hard part keeping numbers low. many people want act like get back normal life. far over. I‚Äôm hoping New York different keep control. 69 times reach theoretical herd immunity. bad.

Herd immunity black white line; approach herd immunity rate spreading decreases surpass rate petering increases.

It's also fixed percent, reflective prevention measures. say 30% immunity half-assed use face masks may enough herd immunity.  Dude, know it‚Äôs fun post kind stuff internet we‚Äôre text screen, know we‚Äôre people, right? We‚Äôre watching stuff creep closer loved ones, grappling immense death, preparing maimed virus inevitably gets us. 3 family members healthcare workers risking lives help people, know what? They‚Äôd risk lives help you, too. Even though they‚Äôre filthy Americans. Maybe remember you‚Äôre talking human beings every awhile. ü§î Someone Gisreal. Arizona one states people keep moving live like Florida? google also find poor working memory associated wide variety conditions including ADHD, PTSD, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, depression, possibly *hypertension* persons working memory issues ‚Äúlow intelligence‚Äù ignorant best.

NY shitshow beginning numbers way manageable good see. hope people learned valuable lesson first spike wont allow second spike happen. Fauci said US would need billion needles roll vaccine there's already shortage. 

Also there's nontrivial number people already think vaccine make sex slaves Bill gates so... Yeah yuuuge, know, know oofs anyone. Texas' latest case/death chart, running 7-day averages: much speaks itself.

And current ranking states deaths: can't effective one listen. Well really much freedom voting. voting rights act purged. still horrid gerrymandering. Insecure electronic ballot filers.(and ballots handled hand, boxes uncounted ballots showing month later normal lol) Mass closing ballot stations dense poor communities forcing several hours long lines. Done work day employers can't stop leaving vote pay go vote either disproportionately hurts people living paycheck paycheck.

Even places mail voting norm issues like ""the ballot showed already sealed (which voids it)"" ballot shows voting already happened. 

This specific election I'm hoping turnout since states permitted mail voting exclusively due COVID-19 yet still remain refusing go forward that. 

And even millions turn candidate majority votes mean win, thanks still existing Electoral College.

Edit: sure deleted comment. expect non-american keep track -all- fuckery lol doesn‚Äôt left care kids shot killed Chicago? harsh is, agree Please try stay safe.

Hopefully folks making political refuse wear mask starting feeling pretty smart Imagine people could cooperate know, use common sense. 

That would nice. actually apparently thing. (Before virus existed) 

Google (or probably don‚Äôt).  99% survival rate, I‚Äôm worried it. Thinking back gross shit friends back college. YEP! Also, Corona virus travels semen right? seeing College Park bars cleanliness them, along people vomiting, people sweating dancing shit. Also frats, yea shit show corona virus outbreaks. You‚Äôre also refusing acknowledge think WHOLE public safety option would far worse apathetic response him. It‚Äôs simple you‚Äôre trying make it. time, data different. Also, time, wasn‚Äôt asked him. Someone like Fauci take evaluate whole data give best advice evidence limitations time. Thank clarifying blame Colber Repor checked Poland recently? went tenth stupid. next one would 40th. Oh see problem. don‚Äôt know word ‚Äúprove‚Äù means. Proving thing saying it. hope clears up. said wrong, doesn‚Äôt make true. know Trump tells things believe unfortunately non trump world doesn‚Äôt work way.

And second problem actually lost actual concept honesty. clearly scroll see responding deleted post, started this. Yes, see eyes. Again, know doesn‚Äôt count much trump world, reality can‚Äôt accept word didn‚Äôt delete objective reality post gone US citizens currently cannot travel Europe. denied entry border. This. plenty evidence country kids daycare providers getting it. Florida‚Äôs recent single day count 10% total attributed children. They‚Äôre getting passing on. don‚Äôt show symptoms one tests spread unchecked rest population. What's going Arizona totally tragic, preventable. think headline misleading though. really fair compare one area peak wave vs different one they're trough? comparing infection numbers peak wave adjusted population, infection rate, kind rate stat?

Coronavirus spread everywhere once, places around world done 1st wave places world riding peak right now.  Operation warp speed done several vaccines. one considered ‚Äúsecond place‚Äù oxford one month behind. lie, havent seen 70% population earns 17k less?

So get 10k makes impact, wish goverment could better enough money since Macri gave money companies free, forgave 3 billion USD debt father goverment.

I come facts come feels, next time prepare going lie. 1st wave. rest world realized long time ago. time there‚Äôs vaccine common cold. probably never happen, look actual structure function virus. best hope people spreading spread weak mild variant, get herd immunity hard way, everyone exposed weak virus getting sick mostly dying. really need alternative education solution year. Saw woman yesterday local grocery store, screaming clerks masks. Liberals, deep state etc. people beserk.

Hopefully sight Dear Leader wearing one impact. ... maybe not. Death rates always lag behind spikes, wait couple weeks can't even get age. also got shingles 31. month husband got also 31. husband got it, asked several times vaccine I'd pay pocket told vaccine shortage even get it, let alone would never able age. month later got foot. year ago still can't anything touch top foot pain. Even wearing shoes bothers me. stupid. also selfish entitled pricks actually care others lives. I'm ashamed town. like virus still hoax exist them. Makes sense; Herd immunity eradicate regular common cold coronavirus, there's cold going around catch get next month so, next year would.

I think what's much likely though reinfection less serious. Covid become seasonal illness people exposed children bad adulthood. carry literal immunity, immune systems able react produce antibodies faster next time around. Canadians wearing masks less Americans are. Highway hell sad experience still hold ignorance.

Nat'cs blame people color democrats. Cruz Sandy Imagine that.  right; I'm Midwest. Way Republicans area. kind quitter talk reason never end. late. Put damned masks stop going bars. really quite simple. went camping weekend, first time going anywhere corner store since March. People wedding, 25+ people masks. Someone hitched hammock tree mine without asking, masks. saw BBQ restaurant freeway, parking lot packed times passed it. Every Goodwill see practically full, regardless day time.

What. The. Fuck. Don‚Äôt need corona-themed ride. They‚Äôve got Splash Mountain. Better kraut country can't even get control. mandatory masks universally. Inept leadership. Lackadaisical attitudes safety precautions refusal follow simple safety rules continue make retuning school dangerous weeks probably months. USA stuck blue screen death much prefer way Experts say virus loves crowds.

You want selectively ignore that, case loads surging average age infected falling.

Who's ignoring science now? I'd like see mayor entrance welcoming visitors. Bad everything = downvote Oh, okay. Well, sorry condescended, then. That's data collected. 

Data collection collation scale takes place within framework includes statistical modeling, error analysis, data quality analysis, variability access, slightly different different institutions.

So, instance, university hospital (such JHU) access recent numbers, verging real-time, say, worldometer, know affiliated actual hospital therefore would tapped private data networks shared healthcare institutions. 

Additionally, since numbers models put forward data scientists statisticians working various institutions, scientists statisticians each, may, like said, come slightly different conclusions things like errors uncertainties propagated collation methods. differences profound, order fractions percent expected, numbers get large enough become noticeable.

Even decisions like considered ""active case"" could vary, though type thing usually worked agreed upon medical community whole eventually. little yet understood virus, though, still ongoing discussion, differences disagreements also still finding way statistics totals.

Anyway, ton ways differences develop, data science fascinating field worth exploring more, hope time helps. starting think intentional. Think it. Putin would better sitting back watching us get infected Government, would front line defense pandemic, works accelerate it. watching GOP led states (AZ, FL, TX, GA, etc.) well Trump denying start hoax pushing return school work peak... seems like actively trying make sure everyone gets it. used Disney World annual pass. fun first year especially different food alcohol festivals Epcot, got pretty boring seeing everything eating restaurants. get dining drinking experience Disney Springs (giant mall run Disney) parks without pay go parks. No, NEVER cool, one things person may found acceptable part theatrical performance photo potential cause issues forever Fun fact: screech likey red trailed hawk. Bald eagles actually sound similar sea gulls....Murica! I.e. people actually go work can't work home ~~, also people may able afford masks~~ number cases matter, deaths do! /S

Dumbasses, flattening curve, vertically. Idk much wouldn‚Äôt accurate compare % positive tested? That's cuz Eminem said r/FragileWhiteRedditor Maybe blow it. Haul ass principal oh-shag-henna-sees office tell did! just...God damnit wtf wrong country Claiming lifelong complications disease that's around 9 months questionable best. couple indicate better NY least trying curb nursing home spread. sure making argument thanks. fucking time! high infection rate? 

London seen less 60 cases per day month now, deaths 10 per day month well. 

The last day London 100 cases 21st May. I‚Äôd honestly say anything data reinforces experience. lines Disneyland ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!!! That's 273 day Due testing, no? Yep probably BoP making sure part deep state plot frame Trump. Easy way tell- identifiable badge number? No? BoP... Southern Indiana treating like big deal hit hard (I think maybe 1k confirmed cases across 5 counties). schools open up, it'll entirely different scenario.

Honestly, I'm surprised places like Toyota cases, thousands people every day, socially distancing wearing masks outside work hours. percentage coronavirus survivors life-long effects, brain damage strokes, decreased liver kidney function, decreased lung capacity? world loses ever loving mind. fact grown ass man decided responsible wear damn mask protect others news ffs. Wow. Actually read comments posts.

‚ÄúI really sorry! feel like asshole downplaying virus one people sick.‚Äù

So virus bunch BS zero empathy died?

(Fixed quote) People died getting hair washed barber getting allergic reaction.

Nothing ever 100% safe.

Complaining harmed rather silly 1000 times saved it. vaccine readily available? made point like originally think gotten much (if any) backlash.

Most evidence pointing outdoor gatherings significantly lower risk. Indoor congregations super spreader, protests, somewhat irresponsible current covid climate, likely much. Especially consider states took place mix ethnicities taking part.

Minority groups impacted due inherent health differences combination sociodemographic factors Arizona getting 361 cases experimental antiviral drug Remdesivir That‚Äôs problem right there. Lack willingness sacrifices comfort short period time enjoy later. want exact, Mask doesn‚Äôt alter life, social distancing argument doesn‚Äôt even make sense regards wearing masks.

And I‚Äôd much rather unsubstantial life 1-2 years able everything want later catch eithe die life altering side effects. I‚Äôd rather think long term focus brief period time. That's reddit do. Cant get mad em, cant help it. Like getting mad dog scooting butt across carpet, know? Good ol‚Äô fashioned aloe fisting trick. Oh no! I‚Äôm sorry. hope makes full recovery. symptoms? see hope stupid are? Seriously though, wonder said ""we're bad look per capita"" try spin this. Gotta tune instrument tad train trigger wake up, saw movie! chili grown inmates Guatemalan insane asylum, guided back health spirit guide sounds like Johnny Cash. could think too. Thank you. Usually arm. Nah, barely reluctant. set dramatic hallway shot Walter Reed purpose. 

Now we‚Äôll see ever wears one Scandinavian neighbors. Oh wait... fair, Pox parties thing long time too. 

But chicken pox attack vascular system. Imagine black plague parties.

Edit: thank everyone history lesson chicken pox. aware, posted original comment. 

The point pox parties are/were thing, black plague parties sure weren't. historical terms, I'd wager Covid parties looked latter light, former.

In fact, black plague, people would parties celebrate ALIVE, knowing it, party begin show symptoms. Sound familiar? Sshhh secret Many people really appreciate NYC. thank help. plenty dumb people like think there's people quietly trying right thing. saying go back work right you, lot appreciative people. appreciative helpful without even proper ppe. It‚Äôs super sad died, people need take seriously. Like stupid 40 year old sister. ‚ÄúLike, OMG, game night quarantine family, stay inside, social distance, prevent spread, hehehe.‚Äù Duck faces selfie 30 people background! üôÑ communities likely unable work remotely require state/federal action actually experts recommend, gee, couldve seen coming /s report medical boards find. that's Empire's secret... masks! much blood many hands. RIP. Anyone else concerned virus allowed run wild increasing chance become even deadly? mean, far good. ‚ÄúNot killing lot people‚Äù hoax sayers say. keep thinking could jump bridge ‚Äúget killed‚Äù would could terrible long term physical consequences? Ugh said trump elected 2016 would death knell thought they'd this, temperature scans like ""happiness checks"". alas, they've kept functional boring. lot cases resolved arnt currently sick. Active cases closer 1:191. still unreasonably high. fog, fatigue, difficulty concentrating 

Sounds like post covid syndrome experience working eating properly 2 weeks. NeEd MeAsUrE pEr CaPiTa MGM Casino Maryland near me, walking outside actual casino floor dude comes casino floor wearing mask properly (guess enforce hard there), pulls nose pops out. 

Dude, good wtf. charged attempted murder? looks like child get way Trump trying win election killing people vote him? Okay I‚Äôll spell you. EU already went it‚Äôs curve disease run it‚Äôs course.

Wrong. disease won‚Äôt magically disappear, first wave passed curve flattened. strict measures taken competent governments suppressed virus prevented major outbreaks. It‚Äôs still prevalent people adhering guidelines, unlike US many people think wearing mask infringement god given right oxygen even though studies show effective, well thinking it‚Äôs hoax Arizona‚Äôs much earlier curve, curve started flatter therefore stretch longer.

While may true sense, warning signs New York yet come rest country prepared. fact states peaking ICU‚Äôs reaching capacity 5 months pandemic pathetic.

Now let‚Äôs get math. 

Arizona population 7.3 million people compared 446 million European Union. put perspective, Arizona 1.64% size European Union, yet still managed accumulate roughly number cases day. 

Arizona found 3,038 new cases yesterday, 0.04% population. European Union recorded number, would equate 0.0007% population. means multiple different countries different responses managed better response one state US.

How could manage even attempt defend downplay statistics absolutely pathetic proves delusional touch reality are. ‚Äúdevoid context scientific‚Äù anyone else thread truly need wake yourself. are, mean bottom heart, deadset moron. 

Thanks coming. could go wrong?...

in 2 months...

Uuupss... emailed employees kick aholes see them! reserve right refuse service anyone. course did, condescending asshole. Anyone could. country falls number 70 HDI, v. number 15 US, might want start focusing country's issues rather endlessly ranting America. Anti-Vax netted one social media marketing group 1Billion dollars, yeah, Billon.

There's money made deception (look Florida Clergymen selling bleach ‚ÄúCorona cure liquid""). 

Even stocks work way, opposite faction benefit other's expense.

Basically I'm getting is, conspiracy (and/or) claims make money people buy it. lack education, logical reasoning, hysteria, menial analysis avg individual... Well like said regarding Americans, fall trap. 


It's gonna long ride friend (but probably already knew that). annoying, indeed! possibly mass media educate people... Yeah oddly coworkers mostly work outside ones get maybe home life outside work? dunno I've read heat kill fast temps supposedly sunlight UV light destroys almost instantly. I'll still talk people think hoax Flu probably Az is. Personally think everything open people celebrating holidays friends family probably spiked cases lot. remember driving couple neighborhoods West side Easter cars sides street entire block. People visiting family like usual holidays that's lot spread Italy China inside family's America First! wearing masks, risk really higher getting manicure? spite all, there's gonna class action lawsuit. know it.

For instance, Disney set ""relaxation stations"". Masks required AC. health purposes they've made special areas masks required AC blasting, there's socially distanced chairs. Well, know airborne indoors...

There's lawsuit..

America, GOP, Disney casualties coronavirus. team this, ‚Äúofficially‚Äù. masks say ‚ÄúChina Lied‚Äù. wish joking. pretty clear going better without sort people would go Disney world middle pandemic.

I wish best catching virus, spreading morons associate with, dying. know that's going happen, one dream. clusterfck There's witty retort struggling make yesterday. XD nice, like kept simple (and fast loading). personal favorite, however, still OurWorldInData, though. especially like normalization rolling average options. (You get GUI editing link's parameters.) 

&amp;#x200B;

It's pity data US split state though. anybody knows good site similar options state-wise info, please give link. depends robust testing &amp; contact tracing system low enough numbers systems keep up. many places US things true fall.

It also depends people taking seriously. Around live everyone thinks it‚Äôs liberal hoax masks government brainwashing dangerous. feel like royally screwed society. get covid? I'm curious people healthcare workers attending parties getting blunt - something better nothing, goal partial reopenings put band-aid economic damage nearly bad medical damage long term.

There perfect solutions, people use restaurants way use stadium, economic impact letting restaurants make enough money survive shutter pretty substantial. 

TLDR: let perfection get way progress. fucked done needs order stop virus. 40 minutes train journey Waterloo. gf fucking infuriated every time walk town, cos least 100 people, maybe good day we'll see 3 masks counting own.

Compromises history tended get bit violent jokes aside, hard restart what's necessary. data suggest get twice you‚Äôre saying know won‚Äôt cause long term difficulties people? Chronic fatigue? Auto immune? years? know sure? [The town Exactly, there‚Äôs lot problems country current situation Exactly.

Everyone pretend like already everyone else it.

But instead get people proclaiming "" DONT "" even without taking test pretending even slight change daily lives save someone else's life greatest insult they've ever received. Florida Gov = mayor Jaws wouldn‚Äôt they? They‚Äôre limiting capacity selling tickets. anything, could probably charge more...supply demand. 

People complain Disney increases ticket prices, fill parks, demand there. That‚Äôs hoping for. Social distancing best thing ever happened introverted self Doesnt surprise me. Heard lots noise Trump moving make polling poor places minorities really difficult  really. can't whole population stay indoors 2 weeks. Doctors still take care patients, aged care workers still take care elderly, people still need get food, people still need supply food, essential services maintained. even single person 2 weeks (highly likely) process begins again.  think front page two days ago. don‚Äôt think many people realize bad things Mexico. Universal basic income solves issue. can‚Äôt - child get it, doesn‚Äôt even make sense Everyone's talking mask. I'm wondering trump 2 dozen members staff including military personnel wandering around Walter Reed medical center.  1% get tiny taste like rest us. got rapid test got tested regular swan reading negatives super unreliable.

Rapid test got back 20 mins... swab 7 days 2005, Jorge E. Hirsch UCSD published paper PNAS put forward h-index metric measuring comparing overall scientific productivity individual scientists.

So, h-index 20, means 20 papers least 20 citations. also means pretty well science! Hirsch reckons 20 years research, h index 20 good, 40 outstanding, 60 truly exceptional.

**Fauci many levels exceptional** I‚Äôm California week avoid gym? * American, never lived anywhere Europe (several countries here).

Ok assumption part apologise. However points really \*facepalm\*

* giving China example efficiently dealing pandemic, evidence far, far, anything lying, manipulating, obfuscating data, generally trying cover anything related actions regarding virus.

I think mind focused China. NEVER STATED CHINA DEALING EFFICIENTLY pandemic. Please read. typed **When whole damn point America dealt pandemic called first-world superpower done.** can't understand it, can't teach read, leave interpret however like.

* getting information from? lying you. insight countries dealt pandemic. UK 44k deaths. Italy 35k deaths. France 30k deaths. Spain 28k deaths. Smaller countries, yes, everything *right*, according you, still insane amounts deaths. Now, countries ""opening"" back up, guess what? numbers rising again, like magic.

I think issue can't read. typed - **There many countries (with much less resources) dealing better US.** clear America dealing pandemic worst compared rest world according reported numbers (but knowing troll probably say numbers fake can't anything ""OFFICIAL"" numbers \*shrugs\*) , really know shit smoking. key word point **BETTER**, NEVER SAID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

* must live bubble. Politicians every country blaming China, even France, home country, Romania. outspoken Americans are, polarized politically Americans are.

Ok explains it. live bubble. happen live Singapore, friends Asia, think China deal right way start attempts silence people outbreak, attempted cover government rest world. However, see BLAMING China help response anyway. said **POLITICIANs**, using cover mis steps dealing virus. Singapore's government never said started blaming anyone unfortunate calamity befallen world (albeit maybe due strong ties China), dealt pandemic best could (not great).

* Again, America. found someone better picture world right you, immediately assumed American. dared point China Eden. America fucked major time, denying that. trying make look like China example correctly dealing situation insane, mark someone uninformed.

Again, apologise assumption, definitely sound like one Americans judging statements fact can't read comprehend sentences. **Because dared point China Eden.** never said China Eden. **But trying make look like China example correctly dealing situation insane, mark someone uninformed.** never said China example correctly dealing situation. know I'm actually talking someone thats supposedly informed he/she can't even read understand simple sentences.

* suspect problems uninformed. Imagine wishing death upon people. surprised find puppet account tries make China shine, like many others around here.

**I suspect problems uninformed.** suspect problems smaller arguably, since can't even read. able read world good. **Imagine wishing death upon people.** Well, I'm stating fact, natural selection happen whether want not. **I surprised find puppet account tries make China shine, like many others around here.** get even PRAISED China anyway, ok.

I'm smartest tool toolshed, think seriously need go back school learn read. can't read, can't respond effectively. said vote November. Oh wow whole 1%! Don‚Äôt tell whole 0.01% died next! called hoax? keeps wearing mask followers same

you may well added ""and monkeys fly his, my, butt"" Cue hamfisted Chinese industry metaphor. Isn‚Äôt country makes people pay healthcare people notoriously don‚Äôt go hospitals treatment. aren‚Äôt listening new people, simply finding people say want hear.

Jared‚Äôs job simply find ways put taxpayer money friendly pockets. words, stupid people refuse social distance right thing. Yeah know that. even take scientific study. wonder % society break - anyone knowledge subject idea? Working memory basically buffer space. allows read end paragraph making conclusion. 

If low working memory, can't that, instead making conclusion end sentence meaning paragraph. revise next sentence gives new, different contrary info. make new conclusion, move third sentence. start again. *stasi would like know location* big news- government knowingly spreading coronavirus intentionally suppressing information would help us make informed choices. Wait minute.....that's Lone Ranger wear his!! someone please tell conservative ""patriots"" acceptable wear face mask people stop dying?

The China study showed airborne, droplets got blown HVAC

There incidents confirmed able reasonably suggest airborne apartment. Hong Kong apartment turned ventilation subsequent outbreaks estates Hong Kong China didnt support airborne theory common touch points elevators instead like princess cruise, infected proximity airborne would suggest

We treat airborne far evidence suggest except certain circumstances like intubation aersolization procedures one observational study restaurant. mean spread public transit Asia airborne significant transmission vector? masks they're wearing Asia much prevent airborne transmission.

We can't pretend airborne mean need negative pressure rooms different precautions tremendous waste resources negatively affect delivery care precautions

""I care, wear mask"". different contagious? math based worst case scenario, us catch it. far tell, contagious makes lower long term risk can‚Äôt develop immunity motor vehicle accidents. numbers likely stay similar every year result, know infectious diseases tend wane prominence time due immunity building them.

I understand cognitive bias towards comfortable well-understood risks unknown risks. Even result likely worse, prefer known risks. isn‚Äôt logical, way brain works. experiment test subject picks different types rocks. One type rock means subject get shocked, one means shocked, one random shocks not. measured stress. rocks stressful touch, counter-intuitively, ones 50 percent chance shocking you, ones would definitely shock you. Even though objectively, worst rocks pick ones would shock you. cognitive bias leads inflated fear covid-19.

Sunk cost fallacy also another cognitive bias clouds judgement. stayed losing war Afghanistan long. 

But right one thing. places country ICUs risk overwhelmed, emergency measures need taken. country, hospitals slower usual due soft shutdowns hospitals make way C-19 patients many cases never came. like amputating leg reduce risk breaking it.  [Why America greatest country weeks ago, Trump actually said thinks people wearing masks show disapprove him. *made it* dramatic continuously refusing wear mask months‚Äîeven visiting medical facilities‚Äîand using propaganda tool ‚Äúenemies.‚Äù Schools gonna filled soon...

I‚Äôm saying young healthy, going bars socially distancing ok. saying quite stupid, people may first think. Yup definitely viable theory... release virus one big cities... Wishful thinking. evidence going fizzle summer, people really wanted believe would. guys destroying yourselves, know.

Hard lockdown, freeze movement, grocery stores only, things slowing down.

That never happen here, people ignorant personal freedoms, free speech, government control type shit. People think Bill Gates going microchip us government, something.

Americans self-absorbed, entitled luxuries become normalized years, impatient opinionated buy hard lockdown here, ever. They're not.  Trump already already bought like 300m doses Oxford vaccine. Nurses shaved heads Wuhan 

I dunno I'd wash hair convenient chart leaves spike 7 day rolling avg end. Deaths going past 7 days. 31 71. Due antiviral properties, it‚Äôs least effective point. also it‚Äôs expensive hard administer really given ICU patients. problem testing later ramp up, actually need ramp faster faster, vicious cycle.

Some states already seeing astronomical rises cause mortality.New York saw somewhere around 2000 weekly deaths last 5 years saw double cause includes deaths aren‚Äôt related COVID, deaths directly caused COVID, deaths indirectly caused COVID. many actual symptoms? many new hospitalizations? many deaths? 

New cases terrible metric testing ramps up. Lol, doesnt mean still wont bad side affects.  Patients assessed mean 60.3 (SD, 13.6) days onset first COVID-19 symptom; time evaluation, 18 (12.6%) completely free COVID-19‚Äìrelated symptom, 32% 1 2 symptoms 55% 3 more.

Anyone anything recent informative regarding hair problem? lot people like wash hair every day, considering wearing cap, able present good reason workplace want get away this. 

IMO, strands grand aerodynamic resistance droplets landing person's body (if theory even holds water), smooth, non-porous, meaning virus survive quite while. sweat air movement, could maybe transmit without needing direct physical contact.

Sorry sorry. using combat roach traps stuffing harris Roach tablets every nook cranny find. find roach look area put another tablet down. far finding dead ones occasional alive one. worse weeks ago found 6. Sweden highest infection death rates Europe. anyone argue ‚Äústrategy‚Äù even remotely successful? still lot people really take seriously.

We also lot people could probably ever afford go Disney normal circumstances never time work able work remotely time.

Great combination we're trying limit travel interactions. strikes. Check ""number excess deaths"" click ""update dashboard""

51k lowest possible end range ignores confirmed number. unlikely right count.

119k number associate ""all deaths involving covid"", also lines middle excess deaths year. looking reasons lower count,

It makes much sense take numbers given reasonable estimates within range look smallest possible number, take fact come reason dismiss everything else. question DeSantis is: Trump let know he's going cum, blast face it? Thanks I‚Äôll Vegas 2 weeks...again. course think job fake could certainly bet it? I‚Äôll go whole net worth. feeling won‚Äôt accept. Maybe peer review comments yours. R estimates merely estimates rather precise values, *is based deaths data*. result, current R value estimates byproduct assumptions result measurable data. 

 

The emphasis original. Texas: 93k tests / million, 16.4% positivity rate (John Hopkins 7 day moving average).

Victoria, Australia: 169.7k tests / million, 0.34% positivity rate (all-time).

I honest, expected worse. Glad put local perspective. Take care! Great chatting stay safe. Everybody keeps saying 'the hospitals over-run', never actually see reports *from hospitals* saying ""we're over-run."" thing *ever* see regarding hospital utilization 'we can't procedures, we're sending staff home.' That's okay, difficult figure what's even real anymore days. everyone gets new new normal declassified virus national requirement instead. still way go, trying get soon possible. Antibodies=/=only source immunity sort thing excess deaths way estimate total deaths.

Individual cases messy. Imagine someone cancer getting COVID... beating it, dying week later cancer?

Did die COVID cancer? That's misleading futile question sense.

The correct question is: would lived COVID?  That's long story that's pretty easily googleable. rumors new breakout new strain Kazakh. Chinese social media network full kind talk right now. Definitely don‚Äôt look different disney fan sites, then. Wow. 

So, 4 greater 11, Americans idiots even though you‚Äôre one willfully misinterpreting headline, you‚Äôre also ignoring tens thousands years human evolution sick people tend spread viruses people-that-don‚Äôt-appear-sick (by whichever label want apply). 

Got it. 

I need converse anymore. 

I‚Äôd wish good health, I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôd argue means. Aaaah feck  Well get 40 percent hit herd immunity But, universally wearing masks, image ""blow up"" like places. Slightly different definition Alabama. Fauci, WHO, CDC.  Covid known cause clots tested know. would post something like without source? part problem. I‚Äôve heard great things Sedona Phoenix too! several friends living around parts.

Looks like Arizona comes [48th college readiness. I‚Äôm sure Arizona kind extreme case, along border all, feels like it‚Äôs decent extrapolation expect Utah‚Äôs system applied different demographic makeup.

I‚Äôm also big believer parental involvement plays critical role education. definitely educated Utah successful academically, guess I‚Äôm concerned don‚Äôt necessarily get attention investment need, delves cultural aspects Mormonism me. New Yorkers built different large part president's 'job' leading example. He's specifically taking mask knows public watching. owns large part blame many Americans refuse wear mask. 

By taking cameras becomes intentionally malicious. college students *may* party drink, shut compromise education students learn? would students labs research online? answer that, you‚Äôll sold online school idea. billions humans live countries proven basically control spread virus. None nations via permanent shelter-in-place.

Step back hypotheticals take look countries getting results, terms public health economy. can't deny success possible China, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, Australia, Finland, Norway, Germany, basically speak. wild ride, thanks sharing story! can't fix stupid. Part wonders get here, another part knows always like worse since dawn humanity cave dwelling era. Yea, check news last month: [China's new coronavirus outbreak sees Beijing adopt 'wartime' **36** new cases.

Sounds crazy, huh? bunch cowards. try reading plain English comments instead making terrible, seemingly bad-faith assumptions putting words mouth like asshole; I‚Äôve clear simple language attempt help seem dead set ignoring I‚Äôm saying. paper happy horse shit don‚Äôt fully understand impact cells let alone quantify effect way. don‚Äôt understand well enough make assertions them. understand antibodies, understand rather well. That‚Äôs they‚Äôre metric use determine whether person needs get vaccine booster not. observation cells B cells less impactful observations antibodies don‚Äôt understanding make predictions basis data study... data clearly impacted politics behind Sweden‚Äôs choice take ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù route playing stupid choice everyone thought would March. 

So you, person clearly lacks medical science background physical science background matter, making assertions conclusions you‚Äôve gleaned paper... it‚Äôs misinformation. contributing collective misunderstanding virus dangerous behaviors borne misunderstanding. 


You keep stupid conclusions yourself. QED. guys getting UI??? perspective. early June, U.S. reporting around 20K new cases per day. Today, Florida reporting 15,300. It‚Äôs said transmission surfaces minimal several months. sudden it‚Äôs become aerosol, which, definition, means particles droplets microns droplets stay suspended air, infusing nitrogen oxygen. means indoor air circulation becomes important take consideration. Walmart open, governor‚Äôs mansion feels like troll sort  probably form NDA. immoral unethical sure, whole idea gonna good economy likely even true. hell real driving factor here?

While every large powerful country throughout history propaganda feed masses - half-truths comforting lies justify perpetuate political system - many, most, leaders USA actually believe it. problem sub, entirely many people willing regurgitate false conclusions without understanding data even science. People keep posting Swedish paper last month finding COVID patients T-cells people repost without understanding *of course would expect people generate T-cells response infection, still don‚Äôt data suggesting reactivating protection COVID.* fear mongering? Research often targets narrow issues, discuss broader context. fear feel reading article based assumptions broader context, assumptions make understood science works practice.

Plus, ironically enough, read cells five seconds, get we're seeing tons articles antibody levels, fewer cells.

Of course care this, wanted first person pretend understand cells get thee internet points. Damn brain russian make another pun, betsar can't think Good one, got person good. New Yorkers make desert, call peace. protesters wore masks. Mine took 7 15 minutes here. state fucking rioting competent testing measures. That's virtually every health official/guidance 6 month old virus, observations. enough time longitudinal studies ""Get gettin's good!"" extent maybe. hospitalizations really started rapidly increasing week half ago, deaths take reported. Give another week, numbers won‚Äôt good. Cause can't, conditions, know well work/harm. Found imprisoned. FTFY. Look post history, he's either real shitty troll joking. Praying Mexico! compare Covid Scarlet Fever, main, major differences worse? sub full people want live like forever There‚Äôs lot unpack there... kind wealth time disparity big problem covid. clearly died multiple organ failure covid though.


^^^*sarcasmbtw* possibility? certainly safer grand scheme things actually gonna set country back much one year school skipped, especially online classes still offered can‚Äôt online classes exactly? Maybe it‚Äôs me, growing teachers simply read slides elaborated them. teachers record upload remotely, what‚Äôs difference? issue can‚Äôt focus threat teacher catching slacking isn‚Äôt there? Genuinely curious, don‚Äôt get believe shit everyone keeps posting landlords needing rent money pay mortgage. No, don't. fucking stupid. landlord, sort savings.

sure, landlords can't absorb months payments. agree people evicted right now, know landlords mortgage payments make much reserves. combo mildly inconvenience, people liking told do, ""team sports"" mentality, since right many republicans mentality ""if democrats i'm it"", bunch deep seated psychological stuff - wear mask concession real scary problem, folks can't confront that. go minimizing issue way verify that. I'm saying wrong, could completely true. existing research it? made point headline factually complete true

But wasn't. headline missed fact UK many deaths Sweden locked down, deaths per capita rapidly dropped Sweden, point Sweden highest deaths per capita.

It also missed point US' deaths per capita Sweden until, reopened hastily instead chose pursue Sweden's ""herd immunity"" strategy default.

That graph showed actually confirms lockdowns work better lockdown good margin. There's big gapon info could gotten long term checks. Watch backtrack now. always loved masks. Masks great. Vote pls need mess country divide people more. Daddy Putin wants civil war. not. That‚Äôs frightening itself! we‚Äôre seeing bad 9 days ago. wish better faster method. high end O2 meters (used lot mountaineering). Worst got 98%. Wife hit 96% one point.

As note, cheap meters tend read low first. Often rise time computer gets better handle waveform. It‚Äôs best figure baseline healthy. cheap one read 96% normal operations. masks help filter hot garbage, like filter..   Waldron DeSantis, Florida. ""allowed test negative virus: Hungarians, two negative tests 48 hours apart case foreigners.""
And that's lose mix politics science. queen/king \*\*\* I‚Äôd guess see massive upticks deaths week based that. Oh, state. NEITHER party would know us. course. virus avoids clusters people support political causes.

Just odds spreading infection outdoors lower mean odds zero. dim. Sponsored part by: Arizona standard issue American territories. Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, hell, even Washington DC issues actually represented government controls them.

A lot territories, also including two *states*, Alaska Hawaii got lucky, held previous military advantages. Guam Asian oversight, Hawaii keep Japan back, Samoa spot farther pacific, Alaska darn Russians, Puerto Rico keep eye Cuba. agree should. people report forgetting wallet masks. That's point. freedom go Walmart without wallet without mask store sell anything reasons. still choice people reporting anybody that. article thread says failing wear mask considered second degree misdemeanor certain counties Ohio. $750 fine. That's ridiculous. like listening celebs. perspective. U.S. Daily avg new cases early June around 20K. Today, Floriday hits 15,300. swear looked like typo saw it. America encompass 'western civilization.' America major decline. Western civilization not. Doesn‚Äôt outdoors make big difference History affirms correct reaction pandemic overreaction. people always second guess later say ‚Äúwas really necessary?‚Äù sucks, need strong logical leader make case... something don‚Äôt exactly lot right now. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è logic hold scientifically? well-established experts outdoor activity much less risky indoor dining, even without social distancing.

Here's even chart showing relatively safe.

So no, outdoor dining yet likely lead 

But social activity zero risk infection. People need stop looking social behavior pandemic binary. Meijers michigan enforcing masks i'm American honestly Irish government putting new arrivals surging hot zones separate military barracks fenced barbed wire whole month they're absolutely sure travelers covid free. We've seen Asia flare ups largely due repatriated nationals living abroad come home &amp; isolated completely long enough duration.  attitude anyway ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never forgive Japanese‚Äù google. could insist tell concentration camps China imprisons people work, instead research. think take long. Looking excess deaths give pretty decent indication already.

And mean, maybe people going dive unearthing exact numbers, care excess death numbers 2% actual count. unlikely we're going state number deaths anything precise integer times power 10 (e.g. 300 000 2 000 000). Sarcasm noted, cigarettes block COVID, it‚Äôll nice thing they‚Äôve ever done me. see new record hit every day past week, lol. wouldn‚Äôt it? point, knowing problem could addressed long ago gotten control business could mostly back normal, got lose respect patience population repeatedly votes conservatives, take precautions, gets results hurt them, again, decade decade, well anybody would go park.

The problem spreads others, assholes keep problem contained may even worst affected cause. Sorry, assumption reinfection then. I'm talking misrepresentation author's conclusion get lost weeds here. think know point response beside since we've already discussed this. yes, that's Japan ok base. national security low, low cost paying stay occasionally forgetting dead raped citizens.

But idea they're crucial way Japan's prosperity is...absurd.  Weird weeks ago incredibly rare. it. Don‚Äôt friends malignant idiots. vast majority cases spread via indoor events like churches parties facilities like restaurants bars. think avoid places exercise care masks hand sanitizer/washing, you‚Äôll safe statistically. That's fault. people masks matter train absolutely him. 

It's really easy prove exact person responsible wore mask suddenly tons jumping ship position. can't trot experiment like large population inadequate safety efficacy results. complaining. making fun people complaining.

Then told jealous jealousy makes look bad. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è yet research found among things.

\---Even test positive antibody test, still found Covid specific Cells.

\---They behave like cells working vaccines

\--- suspect cells likely level immunity even antibodies left.

\---T-cells usually last longer confer longer immunity antibodies B cells.

&amp;#x200B;

 yes know cells play role long term immunity. cell immunity without antibodies. Considering people reinfected despite millions confirmed cases 6 months think safe say immunity beyond couple months. It‚Äôs relative though, passes mild/minor symptoms often horrible long lasting. mention ticking health time bomb undiagnosed physical damage recovered asymptotic mild case population. Silly, homicidal; po-tay-to, po-tah-to. virus killed them. immunocompromised person died Covid, would say Covid killed them. real consequences things, things would extremely rare. Fine assholes throw prison assault. ton cops willing beat people reason. Well, here's reason beat people over. Incubation 5-14 days there's 40% false negative rate get tested 4 days. Even show symptoms, there's 20% false negative rate get tested 3 days. I'm you, anything better nothing. think they're even ""anything"". heard contact tracing all. mom looking contact tracing job. think they'd openings. can't find one. feels like we're nothing. scrubbed clean traces related paperwork long gone would pointless anyway. There's clearly response long lasts unknown. Immunity endemic human coronavirus (one cause colds) brief; one's long term immune system stop reinfection. 

The long-term response endemic human coronavirus also obviously stop development COVID SARS-2 specific antibodies, virtually every person them. think figure 90% population response least three. far exceeds threshold transmission would become hard COVID, herd immunity. COVID impaired all.

Reinfection SARS-2 leading second, detectable COVID wait return epidemic initial pass areas. would flat unethical test otherwise. 

The seronegagive thing means need using sensitive test, person brief antibodies. Studies known positives vaccine development problem finding least antibodies. Vaccine development particular; we'd know material number ""infections"" showed antibody response all. someone who‚Äôs applied bunch jobs I‚Äôd love know well. Keep hearing whining enough tracers they‚Äôre barely hiring! I‚Äôm Florida too, people look like I‚Äôm crazy wearing mask. Omg I'm sorry r/likeus long economy okay!

/s Yea fucked up. heed warning signs Italy Spain France. Everyone saying 2 weeks UK. guess stupid ""ah we'll see maybe happen us"" still think think there's lot come us yet. Slavery bad, USA hold slavery bit longer countries, let's pretend like slavery USA issue, pro-slave country ever. Every powerful nation utilizing slaves long time USA came along, thereafter well. thereafter, mean USA formed, necessarily thereafter USA abolished slavery, though, also true mostly poorer / developing nations ever since USA abolished slaves... sex slaves West... let's even pretend slavery honestly lol... less centralized now, people slavery today point history (pure numbers, per capita). I'm really glad triggered hard. Lol.

As rest nonsense post? Pure comedy. Thanks. Oh FUCK sake, someone stupid? education system US excluded teaching common sense?? Yeah reasonable statistical proxy, though scaled number flights. 

Having time axis would interesting too, assume numbers Europe gone quite bit. don‚Äôt like phrase ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù.

Nothing situation normal. Wearing mask isn‚Äôt normal, social distancing isn‚Äôt normal. that‚Äôs takes stop virus isn‚Äôt normal. Deaths coming. Every serious scientist seems certain that. States already seeing tents patients less capable staff. level care push deaths understand logic here. BLM, right? bit like watching Jackass: first time someone gets battered bruised cringe go ""*Ooof, hurt, right?!?*"" time they're busting faces pavement umpteenth time however, struggle think ""*You dumb, dumb motherfucker, earth expect?*"" 
 
I know sizable chunk population trying best keep others safe, tragic see many people die senseless, agonizing deaths isolation (due nothing stupidity selfishness) longer absolute master class idiocy continues, harder keep empathetic. draining. think both. government fault locking effectively building testing capacity, leagues also fault recklessly going ahead plans knowing government incompetent.

Then last month husband, another co-worker people job tested positive. went quarantine sister's house husband weathered home alone. co-worker hospitalized June spent five days unconscious ventilator.

now gets back work doped anti-anxiety medications keeps forgetting job years.

I'm convinced denial fear. know mother's life stake give can't face issue. lot people trouble it. is:

Also, trump even spell AIDS? fantastic time live Phoenix, AZ... 99 left go ! freedom!!!!! Wow completely backwards.

The higher % positive tests, less testing doing. testing people quite sure illness.

The lower % positive tests, testing doing. testing people even certain illness.

It's much better lower % positive tests. would worked maybe month ago. amount spread still think shutdowns least areas inevitable. want open fucking border week half. Fuck that. normally contact MP I've contacted every politician I've voted say do, voting anyone next election. Australia got covid right massive bushfire. right minds think summer kill covid19? Lol. That's right. mean clear truth. reason something worth knowing reinforces fact contact tracing effective virus long national governments provide sufficient resources contact tracing infrastructure. also confirms said weeks ago asymptomatic spread.

We reputation uphold.

-A Floridian confirm. plane rides COVID. Oregon wearing masks. I‚Äôm happy that. I‚Äôm curious though everyone wear at?
And noses covered too? 

I‚Äôm embarrassed American right now. Everyone circle takes seriously too. It‚Äôs odd National health care/=/a good coronavirus response.

Look UK. saying makes response worse either.

Edit: Lol downvoted Bernie/M4A circlejerk reasonably stating fact part: ""Is percentage heavy corona cases higher diseases? numbers? find \[sic\]"" need new job. Mine asking us come back office already it‚Äôs necessary access leadership collaboration.

Considering NY/NJ ground zero could go wrong didn‚Äôt prepared correctly. draw line moving average graph, longer decreasing nationwide. stopped decreasing mid-June looks like starting go up.

Also, states increasing death toll exceedingly showing excess deaths beyond explained Covid-19 reported deaths. 4 months ago Democrats telling us wear automod broken? Maybe people avoid cough sneeze? Thank you. Please safe vigilant rest us. Tears disappointment we‚Äôre fucking stupid tears sadness many cases think restrictions end life go back relatively normal end effective treatment greatly reduces mortality instead vaccine?

 ‚ÄúMost spread happens people don‚Äôt currently know infected‚Äù. - odds drop 0 15,000 don‚Äôt get plane all. IQ based correlation. use metrics establish success, mental disabilities. IQ can't establish intelligence useless establish things better established metrics.

Nobody academia use IQ anymore, even widely used before; journalism bubble speaking popularized term.

Study speaking subjects, completely misinformed. Wouldn‚Äôt want Princesses set good example kids wear masks? Although, would difficult kids see smiles, get that. Honestly, good point. Probably something keep mind. 

Lots people horrified North Korea also recognize there‚Äôs nothing help aside get house order. Correct, known fact.  electorate says protect freedom really mean protect profit. Thinking perspective reveals lot seemingly disproportionate response threats. Probably medical facility ostensibly large supplies narcotics? Same, appears end sight us working home. know sooner, easier saves money/time long run. do, :( DO

STOP BULLY need to. Huge groups people congregated ignoring social distancing protest. right yes, article says lower cognitive ability linked non compliance social distancing rules. I'm simply stating facts. I'm actually quite bit research Texas v California implications staggering according study, levels HCQ sufficient preventing Covid replicating lungs. knew before, HCQ prevent people getting Covid. However still study found HCQ cut death rates half treated early enough. think testing treatment reducing fatality rate needed. I've heard early fall, obviously anyone would able get immediately. likely given healthcare workers first.

I doubts vaccine work US, though. Sure, likely work me, doubt we'll achieve herd immunity antivaxxers country. Maybe achieve herd immunity among themselves, they'd feel validated I'm disgusted even thinking that. Ya know hope death toll covid reach ww2 levels America.

Can China please send better troll. one sucks) think important rational face disease, get swept catch-phrases sound bites hear politicians talking heads. illuminate I'm talking about, I'm going use comment. one guilty this, needed example Makes wonder New York

This example whataboutism. point brought ""X happening place,"" response say, ""what X-like thing happening Z place?"" engaging whataboutism.

This would appropriate there's relative comparison made. example, someone say, ""Arizona worse response COVID-19 state,"" responded examples think New York's response worse, would on-topic response.

But here, deflecting attention topic hand Arizona currently COVID-19 caseload compared Europe 60 times got idea easy death labeled covid death?

You heard somewhere without serious research topic simply repeating it. accuracy data is, shockingly, primary focus data science going tracking pandemic, hard find papers topic. [The CDC summarizes number papers techniques excess deaths would good familiarize data making naive claims based hear entertainment/news programs via social media. Canada 90% people (anecdotal) wearing masks even numbers plummet.

We passed bunch local laws requiring masks time go inside, yet still see almost everyone wearing outside too.

It sucks huge pain, we‚Äôve almost beat thing it‚Äôs worth it. Everyone seems everyone else‚Äôs sake.

I‚Äôm heart Toronto fwiw. [because source info? author article get this? would nice look detailed data. Many older 'muricans believe weed bad, gateway drug, blah blah. No, Canada didn‚Äôt actually ‚Äúlock down‚Äù per se. lockdowns refer actual quarantine cannot leave, like China. South Korea sure, China? Might want reconsider one. People aren‚Äôt dying cos takes 2 weeks die British technique negotiations... appear clueless outrageous last moment side throws desparation ""better nothing"" deals, try claw much options available.

I see working EU though. Arizona conservatives colors, explain outbreaks Delaware, Michigan, Colorado? angry white liberals?  Who? Technically Phoenix harbor think ships get I‚Äôm not. legitimately insane think CPS would take people‚Äôs kids aren‚Äôt wearing masks. That‚Äôs works. clinical trial lasted 18 months (not Covid related). 3 week clinical trial extremely sketch. hate break you, we're completely fucked long term well. possible, wait scalable Imperial College vaccine first Saving next round drop close election time. no, bribe, vote ok. data question number anti-mask tweets sent state. think better source info Twitter itself? wouldn‚Äôt call government‚Äôs failing preventing murders. 


But argument failing respond crime reported‚Äîthat, agree, would government‚Äôs fault. FrEEd0m! pay people stay home

Shit, going work food chain, clean water, take shit away. lie fact. Bout time arse hat . italy killing 1000 day Arizona less 100 cases. idiot. fucking shit, know COVID-19 is. said they're probably shitty people since they're opposed wearing masks. understand people acting pandemic. take away kids something like that.

Or take away people's cars speeding? litter, ever, never allowed outside again.

Grow up, kid. Actually, local church leaders gave instructions wear masks. this, now, they're committing apostasy and, yes, care that. wonder made Obama different? *stroking chin.jpg* New York got hit hard think many left believe hoax/bad cold/etc. anymore. burying bodies Central Park en masse using refrigerated trucks morgues full.

Once seen shit backyard hard conspiracy theory fuckwad that's making places like Florida Texas bad right now.

My fear going take NYC happening country idiots take seriously.

Edit: wrong, see posts later specifics, mass burials occur, thought. quite understand sentiment here. heavily argued reddit protests across america correlate spreading corona. 2 things true nearly outdoor protests - wear masts wore incorrectly, absolutely social distancing.

Why correlation then? Probably occurred outside. Disney shows stricter precautions areas. 1. &lt;20% wearing masks incorrectly. 2. social distancing. everything outdoors.

Personally think Disney would fine Florida wasnt hotspot right now. least metrics moon anybody strongly considering game plan fall/winter?

 thought pessimist said would lull summer hit hard fall, seem proven wrong worst way possible. disease itself, looming evictions pushed back real plan help unemployed renters. firmly believe civil unrest start popping people nothing left lose, especially bigger cities.  funny kids generally pretty good wearing masks explain why. always negotiations Eurasia Yes. also concerning read current information regarding effects covid-19 people (i.e. blood clots, neurological symptoms). fact teachers, staff, students facing death, illness, post-illness medical conditions eye-opening enough. Entertaining idea returning month's time absolutely insane. NeW ZeaLaNd LeSs PeoPlE tHaTs EaSy tHeM.  dont need mandate tell wear mask. need common sense. live texas,and gov. stupid. stopped wearing mask outside house past 4 months. Well ya see, capitalism like gun power tool car.

It requires regulation, actually makes things _more_ safe, nobody needs education works, works, take care it, go wrong keep eye it, makes BIG STRONG MAN. /s Yep don‚Äôt feel bad all. person definitely infected therefore likely got someone killed somewhere line. Fuck guy, he‚Äôs murderer deserved got. feed troll. wondering... make senses numbers going due availability testing vs month ago? difference interventio. think need look deaths.

We 30 days since beginning ‚Äòsecond‚Äô outbreaks.

Deaths lagged less 30 days infection spikes earlier. 

You trace infections deaths easily first last 30 days deaths keep going even infections continue rise.

I think early say deaths spike back substantially week important.

If doesn‚Äôt spike week sure would 40 days increasing infections. 

I agree though scary part effects patients survive. Maybe put aloe fist first. 100 % agree. New York control praise response disservice 30k lives lost. 

People downing states keep perspective New York 5 times number deaths Texas Florida. Even using per capita per million argument 5 times greater also. went Kroger 2 hours ago actually saw employee pull mask lick fingers, help pull papers apart counting. Half employees masks nose, couple completely off, hurried put back walked by. Can‚Äôt report whole store....ü§Ø  suspect apply many things decade.  People shouldn‚Äôt allowed throw around money get want. Says rich guy always throws around money get wants... president mean? really blame belongs. Holy fuck ok? level paranoia really unhealthy.

Do think countries also fake death records? 

You realize many people work hospitals practically impossible would Taiwan, NZ Finland whatever hide actually lots cases.

You literally created imaginary works inside head prefer anything hear huge number sources. 

Do realize close mentally ill? that‚Äôs reported numbers. Arizona max testing capacity. People wait entire day line get test end leaving run computer stops working. even wait 2 weeks get results. Probably face, knows him. Imperial College Oxford‚Äôs vaccine used. Imperial College‚Äôs vaccine highly scalable aims produce 40 millions doses UK early next year, enough everyone He's making fools supporters....so much know what's real what's not. He's gaslighting them.  American idiot refused mask intra-European flight relative on. Police called, everyone sit packed hot unventilated plane hour idiot luggage removed.

Foreign countries relied US military protection since post war better start kicking us building defense programs brains Please keep constant contact her. it‚Äôs understandable hospitals that, remember virus incredibly unpredictable. patients report manageable symptoms day worsen considerably night. report feel better 2 days get incredibly ill another 2 days goes cycle like every relapse gets stronger. keep contact isn‚Äôt tired talk. virus ravaging hometown right now. saddest stories hear people live alone. mild symptoms told self isolate. symptoms worsen one finds seriously nothing done. It‚Äôs heart breaking. I‚Äôve idiots argue saying ‚ÄúWell, many cases test much everybody else.‚Äù dumbass is. Man here‚Äôs hoping would get virus. No, know statements incorrect largely remain correct: wearing mask protects others *from* infected. not, time, understand much virus spreads asymptomatically.

Even now, beginning understand masks may confer protection uninfected. 

 please, would like see evidence admission knew said anything science-based. 

Moreover, right: medical workers need PPE already run N95 masks Amazon, etc. referring complications, spread. yes, latest February clear going global.

There's immunity measurable antibodies. fade time. issue memory B cells. long created, body quickly produce antibodies needed. Quick, cover everything Arizona iced tea distract rona 137k deaths deaths attributed covid. Comparing average death rates, actual death rate probably even higher I‚Äôm assuming 1 3 things: 1. Typo Florida Governor 2. Typo Orlando Mayor 3. Florida messed anyways maybe it‚Äôs correct. much complicated that. testing countries, like Canada instance, lot tests even month ago, fact death rates gone **is good news** can't speculate future death rates yet. far hospitals go, know United States really depends specific areas hit. Yes, get worse next couple months. course will. We've already seen play Italy NYC, better treatments now, help.

Like New Orleans, bury one person one vault barely big enough one coffin. can't reopen vault year day last burial. someone buried July 1, 2020 another family member dies needs hurried July 2, 2021 would need buried somewhere else then. people say NY well politics.

It huge success, Coronavirus Disney. Well yeah Disney writes laws, course usually break them.

My wording meant, Disney stopped legally otherwise (illegally). worries, like lawyers would sue saw someone post video like princess parade something. None ""characters"" wear mask. staff behind mask though. made sad them. agree, cases far unheard of. know enough distribution yet. Lack testing covering deaths help.

We certainly know enough issue blanket statement ""if 3 weeks since symptoms, feel free go party."" [Lead time bias likely play People getting diagnosed earlier taking longer worst symptoms hit. Death trailing indicator, like unemployment recession. literally one worst indicators whether things reopen. Itll like Brazil curve NY curve. Instead quick explosion 1000 deaths day slowdown we'll see long depressing curve 200-400 deaths per day. Based current R value itll take 10% infected least past peak.

It's written constitution president's (and vice president's) term ends January 20, regardless whether there's election. 12th amendment states president chosen electoral college, house representatives chooses president. house currently controlled democrats, would risky bet Trump make.

Trump huge knowledge pandemics, best words, bestest people. He's learned much last months C 19 found masks started wearing one"" mask he's prepared open country best way ever.  Bowl O' Frice like him, actually looks good mask. Since cares image, keep wearing maybe even advertise minions... [Despite months shutdown meant reduce pressure health care system give US time prepare, production personal protective equipment, includes N95 masks, medical gowns, medical gloves, never adjusted meet massive demand caused pandemic. time, reopening many states meant businesses, like outpatient medical offices construction firms, search N95 masks too. Meanwhile, recent surge Covid-19 cases followed reopening almost certainly leading greater need protective equipment hospitals, especially places currently experiencing massive outbreaks, like Florida Cant wait Biden win november dont hear virus anymore  historically 10% civilization disposable still way go  heard US reached 100,000 deaths still employed. two months ago, alongside stories New York bulldozing people mass graves every state still wide open people partying like nothing going on. radio silence infection rates retirement homes wiped last 6 weeks people say they're 132k saying number least 3 weeks now. I'm betting real number dead much higher. I'm sorry people can't math. feel pain.  explains see 99.999999999995% Australians social distancing wearing face mask...

So fault... they're STUPID. things experts advise like inviting friend Covid dinner party. Pence says lot things. One favorites "" pandemic, bunch little pandemics."" Astounding stupidity. Tommorow might ""You avoid breathing, America."" knows? Deaths caught recent surges. Also, infections seeing much spread New York's surge awhile back. Much appreciated. post often see quickly flame wars start, I've got bit anxiety do. Especially we're dealing pandemic topic.

Our institutions page hurt massively too. Especially since ran Epidemic Drill like weeks months prior actual pandemic. 10 days acting like WTO. They're two separate yet equally important groups key word Separate. They've got responsibilities things worry inform public on. Yet economic standing determines outcomes things much can't rock boat even bail water that's sinking it. 

A young girl claimed medical condition told need mask came store day. maybe mid 20's? ""It's flu."" ""This ridiculous."" 
My response ""500,000 corpses pretty ridiculous yeah."" left store saying worth time. told nice day. 

I'm growing uncertain working this, especially cases up-ticking. One best friends convinced take time before. things changed though. mom already lost job know dad's last next year. We're okay financially moment, feel intensely responsible stabilizing family little can. get 2nd wave possible 3rd wave I'm seriously worried country make this. mention Fall Winter Flu Season intersecting this. whole event shown many cracks little actually care expertise professionalism. Again, all, there's many considered comfortable. Well, experiment indeed. sure wonderful, tho. fighting government relief. I'm already 1 step ahead reasonable estimate, yes. 137.4k deaths though.

edit: nvm dumb dumb Interesting Sweden 5526 deaths, Lombardia (an Italian region similar amount people) 17000. 

I honestly wonder Sweden managed keep deaths low without hard lockdown, compared Lombardia First thought saw pick need psa, covid likes chunky style humans. We're testing dead people. test dead person, going deaths!

As far empires go, nobody US talking breaking apart. We‚Äôre talking election.

Edit: changed 350 330.  Sorry 20 million phantom Americans. guess parade therefore six feet crowds. sounds infuriating. many politicians seems ""campaign mode"" allllll time time actually govern anymore. even per 100 tests still showing positive Always continued easing social distancing mandates United Kingdom projected [over 700 deaths per day  can‚Äôt possibly understand someone feels lose loved one knowingly went get infected ended dying due believing conspiracy theory. say people morons, don‚Äôt get designed fucking President encouraged happen.

FTFY vaccine already ordered produced assumption successful (cant remember one think Oxford one). naive think can't get something approved whenever want. 

All I'm saying check back October. I'll give upvote I'm wrong. I'm trying careful can. get it, hopefully bad point time medical people learned enough help Ok using completely unsubstantiated claim 2.2m infected, 5 times current known amount, that‚Äôs 26% infected. no, using made number even get us close. judge word choices, said said meant it.

I wondering since much misreporting. saw article week Texas something like 5000 ""pneumonia"" deaths Feb June. Whereas previous 20 years average timespan 1000. clear lot pneumonia deaths probably Covid deaths. sad reality. change gonna come death dying everyday. Right skip news depending live see sign virus minus mask wearing folk. Like global warming, school prison pipeline... People aren‚Äôt going give shit. People America nothing lose. death count 130k people don‚Äôt care. sick death American Apathy, however are. think anyone say sure. I'm speaking fact countries Europe managed beat infection almost fully opened now, close mask use all. certainly think masks help. least stormtroopers save. EU hit herd immunity peaked well testing ubiquitous US #*FUCK ADMINISTRATION 

#,,l,,(-_-),,l,, well president said new democratic hoax, immediately made republican core value. downplayed every opportunity entirety pandemic. So, meanwhile, crazies creating links 5g, bill gates, forced vaccinations microchips, basically 2020 contrails added virulence social media nothing masks, I'm UK one wears mask here. think nationwide protests meant lockdown good idea. #1!!! Would happen? Almost certainly not.

But first thought emergency room want comply hospital's rules concerning ongoing pandemic, belligerent violent hospital staff it, probably happen. Wait, what? Flight aware shows air Canada flight Toronto arriving Orlando later today.  What's that? multi-generational housing, lack housing lack access health care, underlying conditions, less access healthcare, need work outside home common among poor countries well? color works best?

Either Trump wins cronies cash massively shit economy, Biden wins right cries shit economy 4 years. feel that. remind looking numbers, people affected black Latino communities. everyone who‚Äôs dying got block party. caught helping set homeless shelter early days brother caught nurse NYC. 

Having seen stuff does, I‚Äôm confident saying nobody deserves die suffer way. even assholes. Doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean lot sympathy them, don‚Äôt cheer on. would ultimately say way anyway. Lmao fuckin funny. Dumbasses Go away seriously go away know refused wear mask. looks constantly pissed wearing lol. would thought didn‚Äôt need invade America bring down. put situation required unite.

Interstellar lied us... New York biggest protests country yet infection rates stayed relatively low.

Almost like outside wearing mask bad anti-mask mouth breathing moron gathers tightly packed groups inside arenas listen conman yell windmills. appreciate concern. really (not snarky). honestly think making decision personal choice.

What said infected need wear one, were, &amp; save masks medical workers needed them. 

He admitted mistaken changed position new information surfaced. general public could also change mind new facts surface. diseases contagious able naturally reach herd immunity.

Even covid, diseases naturally spread much faster nobody immune. higher number population immune (and still know long immune getting it) disease spread get slower restructuring mean layman's terms?

But whaddabout, whaddabout whaddabout....

Oh, Cuomo politician, maybe lockdowns wrecked economy,

No, global pandemic killed nearly 570k people sickened millions wrecked entire world's economy. People like ensuring recovery possible time soon.

Lockdowns best chance (after failed implement mandatory testing contact tracing emerged spread here) halt spread virus prevent long term economic depression continue experience long virus allowed spread unchecked people like incapable understanding virus can't intimidated care you, Trump merry band morons want falsely project maybe there‚Äôs fact virus going absolutely nowhere there‚Äôs cure vaccine.

That's correct. people like you.


 realize brainwashed mind probably forgot this, supposed shut 2 weeks ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù

Its sad people like psychologically deranged believe ability utilize critical thinking basic logic ""intellect=brainwashing""

Again, flattening curve intent, worked awhile. ultimately failed people like inept unwilling following guidelines following current guidelines designed around fact people like get back normal let burn way population

Or could start executing self-absorbed sociopaths like refuse follow guidelines willingly want utilize virus biological weapon commit mass murder Americans susceptible virus go back normal life trolling bars women drunk say sanctimonious redditor saving lives, many times mask flu season?

A: flu rhinovirus, coronavirus certainly Sars-Cov-2. expect understand there's difference demonstrated much less complex principles incomprehensible you.

B: get vaccine soon available every year. guidelines require. 
While assume never gotten flu shot instead go around telling people get one they're idiots letting nurse stab needle instead accept flu allow burn population wills. 

Or wrong that, believe flu shots complete utter many times go work sick? 

Again, never. I'm asshole would risk coworkers' health save sick leave day I'd rather bar work like I'd bet many times texted driving?

Zero. *drive* I'm behind wheel. safely possible everyone else shares road. I've never accident gotten ticket life. 

But questions seeming confidence ""gotchas"" says lot you, upbringing associate worthless specimens humanity believe callous disregard others universal trait everyone guilty of. Michigan here, pretty sure we‚Äòre pothole capitol. one show waze. America oligarchy. politicians power ones wealthy approve of.

Navarro understands deaths lagged variable, he's enjoying time limelight much speak anything contradicts administration's false narrative. actually die once. live everyday. still. town name propos. Duh? GG Disney Oh right even though number tested people millions assumed actual number sick people much higher account makes real fatality rate around half percent best case scenario? seems really low though.

Damn Texas people care get coronavirus then, it‚Äôll late, they‚Äôre riddled pre existing conditions  *John Cornyn entered chat* Well that's actually getting closer true every day. Since roughly 90% cases asymptomatic, means 2.2 million people probably already gotten infected NYC. densely populated city America raw numbers even impressive. meaningless context. can't believe rare see numbers like presented proportion. insurance company Reddit? Yes.

And got downvoted saying New Yorkers hold government responsible happened April.

Do realize making point?

New York reactive proactive. criticism. point bad New York was, yeah, duh man. That's I'm saying. wild New York loves politicians really let shit get hand. 5 states account 42% cases 45% deaths. 

New York, California, Texas, Florida, New Jersey. 

To that's honestly part problem. hard people state take seriously closest outbreak like 9 hour drive away. 

In contrast state responsible .005% cases country people basically saying I'm ruining states economy fuckers can't close should. 

I'm saying right wrong, think helping feel what's happening states successfully brainwashed media. Dont forget, get vaccine Trump presidency, vaccine likely get price-gouged hell administration (probably going ""stockpile""/steal like nation's PPE sell highest bidder, fucking messed shit was) nobody truly afford unless they're wealthy, also hard everyone losing jobs quarantines, meaning also lose insurance.

Hopefully I'm wrong, one thing Trump consistently good lowering bar much mess things up. We're going virus long time lot things dont get fixed asap, cuz way they've going, dont think even existence vaccine stop spread completely States. almost seven times smaller, cases still growing UK's dropping precipitously months? It‚Äôs amazing eased this. sent us home March state announced closing government offices 2 weeks, coworkers saying would probably longer. assumed maybe month 2. Within days started expecting May. couple weeks later read something said mid-June, remember feeling absolute dread date. slowly I‚Äôve lowered expectations. don‚Äôt even know things go back normal (or semi-normal), I‚Äôm holding breath.

UGH THATS 40 YEARS BS Actually interestingly positive stat US Case Fatality Rate take almost pair US State EU member nation similar % positive tests (Spain Michigan, Virginia Netherlands, NY France), CFR always lower US.

The implication seems US hospitals are, I'm action, better. obesity seem lean way would give US higher CFR.

Of course 50% lower CFR courtesy hospitals help end 10x cases general government incompetence wider healthcare system. I've read half 5526 deaths Sweden elderly homes.

But subreddit keen actual numerical facts, seems. Seriously.

But still can‚Äôt get clear picture ultimate plan is, beyond vague ‚Äúone world government‚Äù. Bill Gates Cobra Commander? 

That‚Äôs part don‚Äôt get: would Bill Gates want sit Iron Throne? He‚Äôs got tons cash every need already met. purpose would enslaving world be? says choose sources says either Trump China really sweet all, Even required people it.
There public mandates still plenty assholes refusing wear them. maddening thing shifting goalposts. 

I want point every dumbass meme shared March crossed rubicon literally every single benchmark thus far ""Well least X happen!"" they've thrown far.

I wonder trump library filled children‚Äôs books. clarify, EU minus UK 45,000 dead. 

As continental, also starting measure EU way... makes uncomfortable because, historically, Africa chosen frequent place test medicine countries limited ability say no.

And then, drugs make past safety trials, sell drugs every country. African countries, poor purchase them, left nothing. Except, often, horrible side effects death.

Vaccine trials often use strains prevalent white European populations, African countries.[And pharma companies advocating stripping away health care rights African human year alone, two European vaccine researchers openly suggested vaccines tested Africans safety.

There's reason profitable companies seek poorly regulated countries testing really wish, once, Africa could gain vaccine without human experimentation. Puny god Typos led fun misunderstandings science-based local groups.

My, my, my, I'm bitten twice shy baby I'm surprised news racism something u know media likes stuff Europe actually subsidised countries stop producing goods.

Yep. Agricultural policy particular menace society. Actually paying farmers grow food, might compete sell lower prices imports, despite transportation cost imports. Utter Germany, country economic troubles 2000s EU helped quite bit, I'm mistaken

You bit mistaken that. Germany time considered ""[the sick man mostly social benefits, low taxes, financial cost reunification. Germany paid fines EU that, Schroeder government built [Agenda get country back track.

The Agenda 2010 Gesundheitsreform (health care changes) widely despised time, still are, SPD party never leading member national coalition since then. despite fact current pandemic response is, unlike one GFC, yet focused austerity.

Germany longer focused austerity order deal getting pretty good interest rates borrowed money too, lot huge scale lenders lot trust countries also need borrow, Germany helping fund EU health resources.

Internally, Germany also increased monthly pensions decreased VAT tax rates put money people's pocket encouraging spending. country exports Germans would normally consume? benefit too.

I'm probably sounding like I'm lecturing, I'm fucking tired economists last 15 years (or more), telling us we're wrong, turns probably exactly needed done. isnt advocating mask usage now? Pretty sure kidding  Vaccines take 10 - 15 years normal circumstances. COVID problem *every* medical organization, research institute, drug company devoting 100 percent resources solving.

I think 6 months reasonable timeframe initial launch vaccine, mass distribution next spring/summer.

We'll see who's right though! Funny enough, become xenophobic dicktator he's always wanted would smashing success. Travel bans, close borders, close briefly, sell bunch Trump masks, bask joy weilding much power people getting things call, celebrate controlling virus I'm also wondering this. absolutely baffling people subreddit circle jerk Cuomo absolute worst response pandemic numbers. Get hit first (in US) makes things harder, everyone goes around saying ""Why can't Florida like NY!"" makes cringe. want follow path NY did. Herd immunity way forward honestly wish easy, legitimate way. countries want us haha. 

but really im sure would qualify work another country, like skills arent particularly sought after... looking though, Australia New Zealand need people. looking moving another state aligns values either way it'll take years seeing going, years fast enough. 

I know seems like people deserve get, kinda agree. even massive stupidity, one deserves die poor leadership misinformation deceminated directly people ""supposed"" keep us safe. know theres really way stop now, small miracle, theres way thought I'd least check.

I renter 10 years. paid every month rent per contract signed. expect neither more, less tenants. Perhaps different ""big city"", covid unemployed renters receiving money per month working. would difficult feel empathy decision pay agreed upon rent agreed upon housing perhaps set something aside future months know means so.

Perhaps too, suffer deficiency imagination cannot envision job considered essential still exists, done remotely, pays better unemployment plus $600 week. unless job meets criteria, able pay rent normal far.

And perhaps, seen many tenants( locally, mine) advocating rent boycotts eviction moratorium watched spend increased income frivolity rather pay rent.

I think stay home forever, safe. gRanDMa. Understanding American response makes sense consider ritual sacrifice economy. made joke every Republican practically chanting ""But economy?

I American, never lived anywhere Europe (several countries point saying China this, China covered up? whole damn point America dealt pandemic called first-world superpower done.

You're giving China example efficiently dealing pandemic, evidence far, far, anything lying, manipulating, obfuscating data, generally trying cover anything related actions regarding many countries (with much less resources) dealing better US (practically everyone single one except Brazil) see people moaning China caused pandemic, China faking numbers.

Where getting information from? lying insight countries dealt pandemic.

The UK 44k deaths. Italy 35k deaths. France 30k deaths. Spain 28k deaths.

Smaller countries, yes, everything *right*, according you, still insane amounts deaths.

Now, countries ""opening"" back up, guess what? numbers rising again, like god damn Americans try blame China every single second ignore (or seem ignore) criminal mishandling pandemic great government.

You must live bubble. Politicians every country blaming China, even France, home country, Romania. outspoken Americans are, polarized politically Americans heavens sake. DEAL problem hand. Blame come after. moment world sees, pathetic country cannot deal problem despite power resources, resorts blaming people failures (like half retarded population). 

Again, America. found someone better picture world right you, immediately assumed American. dared point China Eden.

America fucked major time, denying that.

But trying make look like China example correctly dealing situation insane, mark someone bless America. (Natural selection may actually help guys here)

I suspect problems uninformed.

Imagine wishing death upon people.

My school may even start year mandating masks. It‚Äôs joke. economy would better shape, rollbacks shutdowns, hospitals brink collapse immune compromised stuck home still spending would feel safer getting spending. nyc like 45 mta workers died first 2 months. flu said ""Kansas plumber fixes sink"", would follow sink fixer plumber Kansas?

Removing child his/her parents incredibly traumatic, limited cases genuine harm (physical abuse, neglect, etc). wearing mask isn‚Äôt that. 

To entirely honest feels like people advocating spiteful don‚Äôt care kid long adult ‚Äúgets coming them‚Äù. keep seeing articles T-cells better indicator immunity antibodies (which tested for), gives hope. think still might cautious though data comes out. going active least short while. 40 months much different 280. Yeah, I'm Christian, maybe mother earth wants tell us: fuck let alone! regulated supervised meant build immunity towards viruses. People covid parties actual idiots think hoax Biden work trump work him? Yes, BAD USA.
PS : POTUS IDIOT. üëéWith Republican Party. even MAGA mask.

what scrub. Colleges can‚Äôt take hit even one semester lost dorm revenues. financially way overextended already, despite sky high tuition-rates, blow massive sums money facilities administrative growth.

They‚Äôre opening financial necessity- that‚Äôs it. seems like ruinously bad idea. know one school going allow every student return. They‚Äôre planning separate housing people test positive. They‚Äôre planning sending home within 24 hours testing positive live close enough, quarantine housing doesn‚Äôt overflow, expose parents grandparents. They‚Äôre planning virus spreading widely.

From looks like, next peak cases going hit like fucking truck. Online learning ideal, done semester it, it‚Äôs good enough. keep working towards degree. absolutely justification opening institution function adequately remotely. reason create massive nexuses spread. reason anything right besides keeping economy collapsing caring vulnerable. tests turning fewer results, suggesting discrepancy per capita testing rates? Maybe, guess, true, EU would testing negative cases insane rate sheer bad luck. think that's what's going on. think US simply far cases. Case numbers deflated lot much testing.
If test more, you‚Äôll catch more. test less, you‚Äôll catch less.
Deaths much harder hide. joke even make sense. pretty reasonable somebody say they're vegan Thanksgiving.

""Want turkey?""

""Oh, thanks.""

""What come on, why, Thanksgiving!""

""I eat meat, I'm vegan""

""Lol stupid vegoons always tell everybody they're vegoon"" part lol Dont get excited... almost guarantee US goes taking world them. Blow dry vs. blow job.

Alright, maybe I'm little slow, linked poll article 2018 questions relating headline obviously Covid since 2018. someome help here?


Edit: downloaded source definitely study published 2018 completely unrelated Covid. [Link](http://www.apnorc.org/PDFs/Divinity-AP-NORC%20May%202020/AP-NORC%20Divinity%20School%20Press%20Release%20May%202020%20%20FINAL.pdf)



What missing here? author link random source headline claim? mis-link source material? I'm completely confused. Right thing can't really restrict travel states. outbreak one state inevitably spread another one, especially many Americans flaunting stay home restrictions. example, outbreak NYC spread throughout Northeast specifically many people fled city headed home, taking virus them. According Pew, Trump's approval rating Israel 79% second highest world behind Philippines. Stephen Miller Kushner basically run show foreign policy, letting Israel whatever pleases continuing receive billions billions aide US taxpayers. Educate yourself. Also, people sub *mostly* freedumb. handful still comparatively normal(though, seem fatigued monotony pandemic life, feel much stimulation, opinion). feel concerned them. make sure someone like majority type around carrying gun. We‚Äôre number one! We‚Äôre number one! We‚Äôre number one! We‚Äôre number one! 1% CONFIRMED tested cases. ACTUAL infected number 5x-10x greater that. means herd immunity would most, probably 7 15 times away. There's still lot know though that's really rough estimate.

Best case would people already innate T-cell cross-immunity, need reach fraction 70%.

Not holding breath outcome though... uh... unsure would improve degrade ""situation"" mean, like go that's repeatedly? bet finger would good enough know. butthole talking about. sees lot shit ( pun intended) bet ready see that. play axis scales it‚Äôs flt Positivity rate too. I‚Äôm tired CNN‚Äôs dumbass map showing percent increases cases. Hi tencent, you‚Äôre despicable, kk havfun bye! like mess is, Trump politicized much people would rather die go gospel. seriously cult way people worship him. impossible reach them. Say little dont get message. Say much tune say youre reacting. simply made minds choose selfish regardless situation. Exactly.

Not usually happens. less deadly strain takes spread less noticed. People looking reasons offended.  think Disney open issue video. fucking asshole complies now? fucking late point maga mask basically thing. 

It's crazy people celebrate heritage flag stands pro slave labor camp movement lasted 5 years. flag represents. dunno better call vaccine tho! absolutely political failure. like that. Ohio shut later one proactive states.

Be careful parents, guys. must positive himself? even bachelors degree, able get money back school. Random antibody testing NY state 14% like 2 months ago. 

22% NYC Today, feels like circumstance / spin / justification (the public tends embrace slogans justify risk they're taking). REAL problem they're ones taking risk. NONE people making decisions live consequences decisions. culture ""acceptable losses"".  

Grabbing today's headlines CEO forcing Disneyland open up, Trump's opening schools August (there's thousand upon thousands examples could list). Every example same, expose family risks they'd force upon employees/general public.  

It really big problem. extreme wealth comes absolute mobility. Every country option them. hell breaks loose, airplane ride away safety. general public part locked live. escape them. 

If CEO work front line employees put risk (especially record breaking positive test results), probably opening doors. many WH would guts 1980 look AIDS right face say, ""alright let's get work.""

Keep going guys. 2018, Arizona population 7,158,000. those, 275,000, 3.8% illegal immigrants. Arizona currently 120,000 verified Coronavirus cases, 1.8% population. illegal status far likely note seek medical aid, they'd revealed country illegally would likely deported. 

I unable find numbers specific EU Europe. 2017, population Europe 511,800,000. those, 3,900,000-4,800,000 estimated illegal immigrants, fair, we'll go highest number. would 0.94% population. Europe approximately 1,851,859 verified Coronavirus cases, 0.36% population.

People take variables consideration looking statistics. Here's one. dad one, someone making them. also many data points *don‚Äôt* support this. data points don‚Äôt cease exist whenever article like comes out. Wear. A. Damn. Mask. 

I‚Äôm sorry guys going vent here. went home MI CA month (my mother major surgery needed help) practically one wearing mask. Mind you, family works medical field well aware dangerous virus is. heard million conspiracy theories friends back home masks don‚Äôt work, numbers inflated, hospitals getting paid deaths reported COVID, etc. worst part grew friends church saying ‚Äúwell God protect us.‚Äù He.

God help us.  [Here](http://edsuom.com/covid19/Florida.png) plot showing trend Florida. exactly ‚Äúout control‚Äù looks like. Likely half million cases FL August. Yeah, easier compare Trump.

Trump literally morning, ""I've never masks.""

Yes, said that. Sounds pretty scientific guy. Wear mask paste-brained goober. told online friend store work decided stop enforcing state wide mandatory mask orders many employees assaulted people refused comply.

Please send thoughts prayers. Depends treatment works. something taken outpatient prevents cases becoming severe ideally safe enough need positive test prescription easy inexpensive scale maybe. I‚Äôm sure drug stops hospitalized patients dying, significant progress, would remove restrictions. think that‚Äôs lot ask antiviral though, I‚Äôm optimistic vaccine. Masks most? ü§î don‚Äôt think scary, certainly people get long lasting immunity, albeit rare. people caught swine flu also. Astrazeneca pumping doses Oxford vaccine now? Definitely, one going report that. Media report given numbers. fact USA tests = publicity = panic. People ‚Äúpositive‚Äù coronavirus symptoms. Tests 40% effective (correct).

Lol! actually true testing slightly higher rate / capita canada is. However positive rate/ test much lower orders magnitude. Refuse. Yeah.

Good luck family dying. I'm really glad idiots like actually ones suffering deaths once. Exactly. fall every time. u honestly rescue moment? realistic, majority population ridiculous. wear mask even they're told to, amount good meaning individuals going change them. hope see Trump wearing one copy him, though doubtful.

Even laws imposed, they'll ignored. I've previously studied viruses briefly pandemics. Everyone keeps talking about, ""stay home Halloween cancelled"" keep telling everyone know assume/mentally prepare next year cancelled. mean end 2020, mean next year July/August 2021. Pandemics last 1-2 years. We're what...4 months in? Unless something drastic happens November, we're stuck foreseeable future. Dewine started good, let's revisit year dust settles. ""Sorry Timmy. reopened schools cleaners left used Disney World. Also, teachers dead brought high school sophomores teach elementary students.""

The sad thing is, even election don‚Äôt trust who‚Äôs likely coming in. trust Biden Trump, sure. still don‚Äôt like it. read something yesterday reddit; Another four years Trump like getting shot head, four years Biden like getting shot foot. suck, ones better guess.

There‚Äôs another way US stands nations isn‚Äôt related Coronavirus, it‚Äôll show head point. 

It‚Äôs actually something I‚Äôm pretty concerned about. military steps oversees transition (in event election isn‚Äôt honored), great. 

If don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm like 60/40 we‚Äôre kind terrible, violent upheaval addition virus. 

I truly hope doesn‚Äôt come that. heard family member Kroger Murray enforcing. local butcher shop went yesterday enforcing. went CVS yesterday, pharmacy places, enforcement. Louisiana outdone! manager blaming HRT maddening irresponsible. That‚Äôs like saying cisgender woman died COVID birth control pills, cisgender man treatment low testosterone. OK really weird moved Phoenix Houston Houston DEFINITELY Austin... Fucken NOBODY wearing mask state re-opened.

When got Phoenix like 3 4 weeks later Texas began re-opening bars restaurants, thought everyone Phoenix reacting seeing many people wearing masks. guess got normalized Texas kind fell victim social behavior whatever stopped wearing myself.

In Phoenix though, definitely New Mexico well, astounding many people wearing masks. perplexing Arizona high infection rate compared Texas rest nation. wear mask sensitive ninny. that, carry spares car I'm selfish. clue whether sarcasm all, it‚Äôs funny af passed stage 1 3 lot change month, 15,000 new cases Florida today. get apocalyptic healthcare system.

June 22nd governor allowed local government pass mask ordinances/orders. June 30th governor started ""unopening"" state banned gatherings 50 people. Please patient, rewarded spike deaths soon enough. also point despite laws orders, majority population gray hair Arizona never stopped wearing masks, thus majority cases reported younger people decided go eat clubbing May 15th (and parties 4th).  live country insurance tied job, like choosing life life. Isolation other, except emergency workers, way shut virus. everybody isolated, 4-6 weeks, life might get back normal. huge, necessary sacrifice. wish gold gift savage post was. lowly upvote, anyway. think people situation feel abandoned abject refusal public health authorities government even consider mental health impacts policies, whether people already mental health problems, mental health problems logical consequences broad shutdown strategies.

Look Italy herd immunity won‚Äôt solve covid-19 problems without proper vaccine. assume kinda alternative dead grandparent whatever. It‚Äôs almost though virus vaccine cure going long haul, really accept get back normal instead masking locking forever.

Crazy, huh?   Disney fandom people worst strain Karen. People don‚Äôt cough sneeze likely transmit infections. That's terrible...can stay anyone else responsible calms stay safe?

I‚Äôm genuinely glad Canada isn‚Äôt state we‚Äôre in. live PNW, particular love appreciation guys, folks know. read vaccine developed Russians passed pre clinical trials remember outbreak sirens going constantly day long. brutal time EMTs. need army volunteers state staff, claim know logisitical mire would be. I'm saying good thing, complicated situation lot bad choices. 
  
I know Arizona plans do. know fantastic solution came would interesting see, cursory search looks like they're thing keeping nursing homes separation PPE: said week ago would go 15,000 billion needles? 330M people US. 45% instead choose harm 55%? Yeah that‚Äôs saw another report too. one said 11.25. confusing. Oh sorry, call rookies boots probies lol Nothing last month accurate. need wait. Ironic guys love shit talk America using American website.... governor tried extend safer home order Republican lawmakers decided they‚Äôd already given much power letting sit office play pens hamstrung even second order gets control need approval take minimum two weeks decide actually attend meetings. Usually gavel leave, go TV say awful governor don‚Äôt want another republican again? Post July 4th party related testing numbers start coming in. single day, Florida 1.5 times total number cases Australia total thus far. Similar population sizes.
It seems like Victoria NSW trying help reduce gap though. Organized stupidity........on display. Good point. high levels uncertainty making hard people know way jump. since educators across country expected work funding before, less, usually ability buy expensive software help course design, hire recent college students help instead letting drive UberEats pittance. solutions there, require creativity funding highest levels, seems short supply. COVID deniers: well that's testing more...*insert Batman slapping Robin meme person feels like mask shopped study, protests, they'd go bars restaurants? think highest daily count period, Florida. New York's peak day according worldometer 11,600. really think military least would shit together. Something like ripping members could dramatically affect ability job. consider top threat operations. say ""we bother them"" (at least recent podcasts). stance wearing masks, know effective are, let mask-wearing lure public false sense security. Many (but all) papers touting masks solution pure garbage - peer-reviewed, even written experts disease transmission bio-aerosols. We've hit herd immunity things, like measles, due vaccines. soon anti-vaxxers started lost areas suddenly comes measles outbreaks again. English Exceptionalism finest. would hope staff least wear masks. Personally think taken sticker. Going hospital breathing air real risk anyways. could grabbed sticker baby wipe worn it. sticker makes job hospital staff easier. Shame service worker lying screening process, probably pissed yet another person want comply common sense rules designed ease burden already on-edge hospital staff. nobody blame yourself. fair, 1% tested positive, probably 'achieved' like 4-6% infection. 

So getting 70% (if that's even right herd immunity number) mean 14x current cases deaths, 2 million dead. 

And lots non-Covid deaths completely overwhelmed hospitals.  mean... everyone's life equally worthless, yes, valuable.  genuinely hard guys look anything new cases? know media exactly helping garbage reporting come on.

They reported 140k tests today, like double usually report. 50% increase new cases doubling testing right expect.

They've stabilized like 2 weeks now. trump admin isnt 100% blame. population simply isnt following common sence iv look places control.  15.5 Honestly wouldn‚Äôt surprised wearing get potential voters side November. That‚Äôs lot believable dipshit believing adhering advice experts. Here's actual stats June 2019 compared June 2020:

Murder: 30 39 (Up 31%)

Rape: 138 109 (Down 21%)

Robbery: 1153 948 (Down 18%)

Assault: 1953 1948 (Steady)

Burglary: 817 1783 (Up 118%)

Grand Larceny: 3744 2317 (Down 38%)

G.L.A.: 462 696 (Up 51%)

Total Crime: 8297 7839 (Down 5%)

Year date Hate Crimes also 38% shooting incidences 130% June compared June 2019. 

For context, although murder NYC 30% June 2020 (and 21% overall first 6 months year) take figures grain salt. Why?

Here's number murders every year 2010-2019 order: 534, 515, 414, 332, 328, 352, 335, 292, 289, 318.

If current numbers hold would 362 murders year. increase last year outside typical range 2010s. 

So murder rate increasing continuation slight increase murder rate seen 2019 historically low decreasing murder rate trend throughout 2010s.

Overall, shootings burglaries slightly less crimes overall. gives complete picture what's happening NY pandemic. British civil servants expected make back office least January. action leaders allowing virus holocaust occur citizens. Especially advance knowledge science compared 1918 spanish flu. 
For called advanced country acting pretty ignorant stupid. People relaxing masks Catskills much worse. also still things right keeping bars closed, people work home also still that. think people NYC work home easily many parts country.

I still worried we're going spike think get bad was. won‚Äôt happen unless Trump calls it. 

Which early November. Democrat majority states. mean tested deaths. idea many total deaths? way find out? announced two days ago 1% America gotten COVID. 

Not even Sweden one highest per capita death rates never closed close herd Dems find anyone creepy Joe though. include bonus deaths?  terrible news headline implies.

positive test rate went 11 percent. 

consider: July 8th found nearly 9K positives 52K tests.

today found 15K positives 143K tests.

After war independence ended 1783 United States created congress abolished importation slaves 1808. United States allowed importation slaves 25 years. Compare hundreds years British, French Spanish legalized importing slaves Africa.

* Public gathering 5 persons forbidden long family
* Masks mandatory stores, doctors offices, etc.
* Churches, schools, non-essential public buildings closed

The measures also quite widely accepted voted unanimously national parliament. Cool, Florida Arizona, California, soon Georgia, Louisiana. REKT One consolation probably feel half. Actually, countries EU testing US. (and getting much lower postive rate tests) much less cases walking around. would happy political side equally penalising political side's preferred behaviour? sides lawyers think reasonable excuses. know that. said compare apples oranges official case numbers different meanings. Although, numbers could actually 10 times higher estimates. Still far herd immunity, much life yet lost. Lenin ten years exile Siberia. Four months?

I‚Äôd argue first major steps Holocaust taken November 9th, 1938, event called *Kristallnacht* happened 30,000 Jews arrested *Sturmabteilung* shipped concentration camps.

I‚Äôd even go far say Holocaust began January 30, 1933 Adolf Hitler appointed German chancellor. 

I would highly advise go think long hard pointless point you‚Äôre trying make is. Interesting math IFR estimated .4%. Guess you‚Äôre ignorant understand CFR meaningless. I've thought lot statements situation progressed, really think I've wrong. Experiencing quarantine bad - I'll admit might underestimated short term job losses, certainly incompetent handling US government.

My main points remain coronavirus threaten humanity. cut double digit % points numbers. economic consequences slightly greater thought? Sure, mind admitting that, consequences still mainly economic - though readily admit little comfort family deceased, believe also initially said.

I also admit slightly underestimated collateral damage busy hospitals, often run capacity good day. However, still hold firm amount deaths astronomic. Far high many countries, doubt, dealing something recover generation two. like hospital completely overrun. miss opportunity shit Trump, I'll quickly say handling surprisingly incompetent, even him.

So overall feel fairly vindicated, though 100% correct. I'll say maybe 90% correct, give take % points. could pretend expected every part this, mind honest. spirit, would bet quarantines countries? I'd forced make split second decision sent comment, honestly quite know. try careful, denied possibility. Might underestimated chance step 10-20%? I'll concede that, sure, think would said tiny chance happening.

There's much say, I'll end there. I'm saying it'll easy.

I'm saying road map contain infectious diseases something live with. I‚Äôm confused none performers wearing masks. anyone insight, would greatly appreciated! gets sadder realize many people politicizing refuse wear mask inconvenient them. people YouTube surely know ‚Äúprofessionals!‚Äù /s think cfs since Jan March. also two weird illnesses.

Massive brain fog. get work done. Grumpy. Short termper. Finally 'woke up' two weeks ago largely better since. omnipotent. one time, people wearing masks would take away hospital use, kind like idiots hoarding toilet paper beans. 

If real life, would say slowly, imagine I'm saying super slowly:

Science changes. Nowadays fucking wear mask. Iran would agree American peoples handling unbelievable. live Surrey, boarder town Washington State.  wonder Americans get much international news Canadians know bad handling comparison rest world. embarrassed.  Instead they're embarrassed wear mask. also think understand math doubling stupidity multiple times. like Trump, Abbott slowly relinquishing control local goverments. many local goverments enforcing mask orders. 4 months late. Oh please don‚Äôt get wrong; Biden 1,000% wore better. Trump human filth responsible thousands upon thousands COVID deaths completely avoidable. That‚Äôs unfortunate, there‚Äôs plenty online instruction awesome. Absolutely. 


I'm saying one things can't let (you, him, her, they, whoever) in. Ah yes, sorry thought talking blood part.

Yes, certainly possible. Infact, speculated influenza virus evolved way help RNA viruses. Also can't #2 said interview day would wear mask. likely combo hospital leadership begging staff 8n advance, staff trying convince good reelection, maybe slow internal realization bad fucked covid response really hurting ego bad public / international perception.

Instead, probably take one day time keep following recommended health safety precautions. Meanwhile believe science took seriously beginning cases per day still going down.  much better treatment strategies now. Back March put everyone Vents terrible idea. also much much better protecting obvious vulnerable populations (ie nursing homes/assisted living) ~1/2 Americans willing learn

Ftfy case rate towns versus US towns lol Evidently, population Arizona totally lacking common sense. Mask? No? Distancing? No? people get there. Oh, western spirit; I'm tough, nobody's going tell do. people, governor John Q citizen, WAKE UP. SOMETHING WRONG! becoming suicidal behavior!  mean really matters hospitalizations deaths, yes. That‚Äôs say people shouldn‚Äôt taking precautions people aren‚Äôt getting hospitalized causing people hospitalized numbers exceed capacity it‚Äôs really issue.   long America going virus?

It's going around awhile. Even developed vaccine tomorrow, could instantly administer every single American instantly would still around least another year large population people refuse vaccine. Honestly kind impressed. fucking blind demand come table make plan reopen. Fuck keep Americans choose loopholes. want drive Alaska sure. 10k deposit 2 days collect Alaskan border. show couple articles. credible backing. It‚Äôs body count though. agree point think overall long term damage culture worse say Bush even Nixon. Trump definitely shitstain bad internationally say bad Bush regards domestically? He‚Äôs probably worse. took country already cracked past internal issues stuck little hands crack ripped right back open. embolding repressed silent racism, acceptance foreign interference elections, stepping bounds executive branch, handling protests pandemic. perverted redefined presidency. Even 4 years done long lasting damage either unfixable grueling undo. Especially comes cult. 

He may gone foreign country waged pointless war profit body count seas high Bush (and know Bushes terrible things carrying generations also. 

But Trump fighting war. even claims wartime president now. He‚Äôs speaking virus ‚Äúfighting‚Äù current vantage point see declaring war country profiting destruction. 

Last time looked Trump 130k+ deaths hands. Greatest President ever! /s

*edit* argument stance worst president modern times. founding fathers Washington crap. monsters too. taught sugar coated past. DeSantis bad. make Cuomo good. Cuomo bad, thousands died him. Yet heralded hero test negative cases exist. virus equally distributed throughout tested populations.

Imagine EU 200 people 20 cases. 100 tests catch 10 cases.

Now imagine USA 150 people 50 cases. 100 tests catch 40 cases.

More tests per capita show cases per capita. Ramping testing EU going reveal cases per capita that's simply reality.

So real world. justification thought need protest greater need parties activities. Whether agree immaterial. protestors, saw video learned least three incidents police misconduct told staying home, absolutely vital spread message soon possible, 12 months pandemic might over. Again, don‚Äôt agree it‚Äôs hypocritical see one expeditious need desire put over. would really cool concept threw AR glasses something simulate lasers, explosions, health packs, etc. spicy dill pickle? U.S. set world records

Does breaking World Record counts setting New world record? also probably also assumed Trump dumb is, least dumb enough mess keep us pandemic mid-july are. Winning original comment said, obviously nothing state. way parents bought home $40k anywhere near Phoenix. Home prices start low end $250k anything within 60 minutes Phoenix. knows, maybe wealthy country buy worlds entire stocks keep themselves.

Like US done best drug found far treat it... Really? know might super hard I'll try go nice slow. Go google ok? bar type ""37 year old port Clinton"". Hit enter (that's found keyboard). Pick articles like. based account. doesn‚Äôt want upset trump thinks he‚Äôll reward forcing state pretend like virus doesn‚Äôt exist literally major article yesterday T-cells providing immunity thst posted here. crazy many non scientists jumping antibody train antibodies arent thing providing immunity hate argument. Testing magically create COVID cases. rise cases bc spreading. spreading, would test many people see much lower case numbers.

Some people critical thinking skills. Run around house pickle mouth? take least Christ like action possibly can.

-these people #MAGA. # 1  don‚Äôt luxury working home, multiple generations one household, less resources don‚Äôt need tell heritage thank invigorating history lesson need.

Besides persons point flawed talking one instance immigrants fleeing Europe using generalization. known fact thousands Jewish escapees welcomed america, family included. eyes can't redeem himself. made money told truth. Brain damage? Good gods we're already retarded enough. cities did, others nearly high. yelling, cheering, coughing, singing, eating etc. also social distancing protest crowds. think pretty safe outdoor crowds. Disney mask policy well social distancing overall seems even safer protests. Pfft, everyone knows Manitoba. powehouse cell, right? China 60k dead never brushed ""far ideal"". abject failure. Yet expect government competently manage second wave deal Brexit. deluded. say america fail. U guys continue consume internally roll along. world roll along together without u well. 

In fact, sounds like exactly u want. got u wanted. Good job! Keep numbers up, u continue get u want. i'm happy u! America might actually reach herd immunity states pace. don‚Äôt mean positive way since way hospitals handle amount patients. You‚Äôre right, reddit going ride train November. making Trump look bad, nobody honestly cares virus. Deaths per day going since March, it‚Äôs getting better better every day, we‚Äôre testing more. Imagine worn mask encouraged 'followers' take virus seriously March. Misinformation^ Lol really think mask going help much lol People eyes. 

I know would love China bad this, government lies something mean lies everything

And many cases China something ""opinion"" on. objective number.

You might opinion trustworthiness Chinese government, zero basis ""opinion"" many cases are.

I suspect Korea Japan mostly ignore official numbers China due diligence. manage beat it? least reduce symptoms? Jesus Christ, asshole. THIS. Prescott day un-fucking real many people wearing mask! like 2018!  fact hotspots areas large minority populations? Clearly doesn‚Äôt jive old white conservative narrative? people going wear wearing whole time. say take entire state Arizona put somewhere else along Florida. Maybe blessing disguise. walk dog past day care every day (Florida) single staff member kid wear masks. Wow. Thank this. Well said. Masks aren‚Äôt going shit point. county needs locked completely 2 months least. Ditto son still going so... cannot imagine live country consider education non-essential. Every first world country made opening schools priority (at least elementary) first phases. Food hates lately, found still deep hatred it. forest nearby, go walk, refreshing. Go weird hour bad weather avoid people. non countries testing effectively south Korea, serious gamble. Maricopa county make like 99.999999% population though? M. Bison hardest difficulty w/ turbo I'd find exact quote, even Fauci said general public need masks, said someone feeling sick wear mask prevent spread. learned minor symptom/asymptomatic spread, makes sense everyone wear mask.

Prior COVID, think many Americans realized saw someone another country wearing mask street, usually protect themselves, protect others. whole mask debate shown concept protecting others hard one grasp.

Finally, think Dr. Fauci got caught fast moving sound bite culture now. little time nuance single statements pulled long interviews. Science never ending process know changes learn - ok that. great example HCQ. showed promise early on, subsequent studies showed work, could cause harm. But, still people hung early studies instead adjusting think. BLOOD BLOOD GOD!!!! Cabin fever boredom, another option. live New York? clearly relaxing here. Masks still pretty common, ubiquitous, people gathering together. Even heard bunch people going bars (I guess illegally) opened recently‚Äîwhich would happened 2 months ago. Main reason Deaths previously dominant North East outbreak mitigated, situation sun belt gathered speed.

In addition that, treatment virus better, cases caught testing, sooner.

Deaths US longer continuing decrease. surging too. think worst part COULD okay now. everyone taken even basic steps. Wearing mask near 0 effort even wore bad substitute like scarf, would enough minimise effects. Anyone vote. Oregon ever hear people pissed entitlement disinformation surrounding COVID-19, sadly it‚Äôs south suffer consequences. issue DeSantis done absolutely nothing. taking exact approach Trump. Blames everything everyone else sitting hands. don‚Äôt want lead get f*ck out. GOP literally become death cult. Like chemo cancer. great, (hopefully) gets rid what's killing us - work getting healthy Chemo. survive. Let say civil manner 
#I dislike Bernd fascist friends due fact virus already ran rampant city time protests began. NY still death rate 166 per 100k, 2nd country behind NJ. 

AZ 28/100k. Treatment improving younger patients catching it. think playing much cases exist, whether test not. many areas high percent positive rate indicating testing still inadequate, we're actually kinda cherry picking severe cases again. Hospitalization rates fatality rates telling.

The rate reported cases lower. Treatment playing big factor. example, NY's peak, starting realize clotting factor, something treatable many patients reduce effects since. Deaths trail reported cases month. drop dead 5 minutes testing positive. live Arizona, wife works hospital affected area. see it, die long protracted fight ventilator used last resort. Currently majority cases young healthy people going good time masks made mandatory couple weeks ago. Yeah stones petition Canadian government phased reopening border. Hell no!!! really hope there‚Äôs commission established determine USA completely dropped ball here, prevent screw like ever happening again.  happened china nothing excuse america culpability. entire rest world warning, regardless whether feel like enough. countries took seriously. america not. Death freedom. Ironic many levels. Live free die Hollywood slogan, doing. =[ know, I'm mask person, feel trump destroyed mentality credibility Republican Party, can't believe stuff comes mouth, please remember, minority, trump lost popular vote trying take many supporters leaves November. Hopefully trumpets discover another area try colonize, hate brown people Canada better watch out.
Edited:wording Texas two steps ahead I'm professional data scientist master's degree Math William Mary. Please come educate statistics.

That's surprising, since apparently understand disease causes complications &lt;1% patients spell doom millions people US population gets it. Sounds right. 2.17 deaths per million (USA) vs 0.37 deaths per million (Canada) July 12, 2020 Individual deaths yes, total excess deaths hard hide. former I'd rather see studies after-effects virus, range serious mild one knows long last. ever present ""They drug patient put ventilators. ventilators drugs really killing them!"" data leading COVID-19 vaccine candidate Oxford University suggest may like flu vaccine smallpox jab, reducing severity symptoms preventing infection.""

I.e. even vaccine would still get infected would infect others - would make symptoms hopefully bad.

That's bad news anybody wanting take vaccine - getting vaccinations help stop spread virus. state denial virus first place. would likely sue people reporting ones actually spreading it. nearly 300 cases Melbourne today

People freaking out, back full lockdown people wearing masks even though mandatory There's plenty top quality healthcare, easy stay home.

If rich.

Guess sorted everyone else? mean, California locked anyone else. fact, Bay Area first lock everything down. New York late party probably could saved lot lives shut everything soon Bay Area did.

In fact, cases rising here, Bay Area actually kind success story. basically ground zero Coronavirus, first confirmed community transmission case too, see huge outbreak New York did.

Now there's lot worry people getting fatigued safety measures. sure Biden actually wants open schools? Theres alot money made cutting school budgets virtual learning. Weve already seen Democratic governors like Cuomo talk brick mortar schools outdated. Almost every operational emergency medicine course I've showed video footage station fire. Fuck assholes. Covid 19 isn‚Äôt political - even trump wearing mask now, stfu get board saving country. sucks must hemorrhaging money parks closed likely difficult financial position begin overleveraged Fox acquisition. But, things important money. Correct, testing way more.  Maybe start headlines guys getting covid dying. would good next step.  Yep, figured that. I'm wondering things change next year time things start opening again, people decide monitor number cases stay inside go without mask, play politically, people react long periods without social events, etc. I've never lived time many unknowns, making crazy. US also shutdowns new cases family gatherings. Exactly. book Factfulness many great examples kind.  statement ""this fair shocks people action"" justifies lying, that's valid reason spreading misleading information. Comparing peak one wave trough another misleading. lie, dig data see significance people gonna that.

Arizona's tough time it, fault, agree. blame China deaths camp. Got  License plate car/bike/truck So, science says wear mask outside, middle woods? You‚Äôre probably correct. :/ susceptible conspiracy theories propaganda isn‚Äôt unique people underlying conditions either, that‚Äôs snazzy idea lets mock people internet. freely admit I‚Äôm biased work adjacent PPE compliance know exactly little otherwise educated intelligent people refuse/forget wear safety glasses like.  I‚Äôm worried too. Makes wonder New York forced nursing homes take covid patients. elderly people risk, expose that? 

Since I‚Äôm topic, got idea easy death labeled covid death? Pretty easy. need covid system dead. literally two requirements label death covid-death. doesn‚Äôt matter killed car crash, shot police, jumped building... covid system died, even asymptomatic, died covid. isn‚Äôt speculation, really health officials US defined thousands covid deaths. Now, knowing that, think there‚Äôs chance death rate inflated make virus seem worse really is?

Edited spelling grammar. Arizona National average testing, testing reason New York world worst right (it isn't).

Sort tests per probably, good hearted idiots likely mixed vile, hateful, corrupt. Poor DeSantis act like capable experiencing empathy

I think going work tho... thought new slogan ""keep American great"" population Europe 60 times desert? That's what's weird me. anything we‚Äôre slowing sheer number new cases casing run tests. state hasn‚Äôt even seen massive outbreak, we‚Äôre issues getting supplies testing kits states around us setting off. live nyc, ""taking seriously"" explanation. Subway bus ridership 2.4 million per day. Cases increased all. explanation immunity. They're also likely Conspiracy Fucking Guessers (sorry, stupid shit worth called theory even hypothesis). counted, happen? /S

Oh empty houses, yeah, Bob Marie died emotional distress due lockdown mask rules. Masks bad, lockdown bad, freedom freedom! /S üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ hope disingenuous obvious stroke caused COVID-19 blood clots.

I've seen many people dismiss deaths like attributable COVID-19 despite fact died otherwise. Many people die pre-existing conditions due COVID-19 accelerating effects completely compromising overall health. Irish need ban travelers US, Americans shouldn‚Äôt allowed leave US pandemic dealt with. Perhaps way get lot anti maskers board. nice knowin ya, everyone totally agree. everything controlled, keep legally closed already good step. Let‚Äôs clear though idea it‚Äôs permanent long term, there‚Äôs huge difference. I‚Äôve lung-related issue took around 6 months feel normal energy again. completely drained quite time. *did* heal though. Lung issues take while. 

I‚Äôm trying minimize it, experienced something like myself, tell 13 years later feel like never happened. Even year after, felt way. virus new know side effects permanent long term. replace soon yes-man cheerlead reopening back school Hey, insult muppets like that! They're way cooler thing office moment. Yeah, haven‚Äôt opened one Florida. OKC Tulsa Lawton yet mandated masks. Norman Stillwater has. Arizona western Florida. people, mentality. Less humidity.  think context much cases ratio testing cases. danger ventilator usage that's finite. Regardless tests, infection symptoms what's dangerous.

There's 4 levels affliction. 
1 - symptoms 
2 - 2 weeks flu 
3 - 60 days. Sometimes hospital 
4 - Ventilator usage 

2,3 4 happen regardless tests figures recorded. numbers help shape progress.

What know statistically 3 4 smaller percentage population.

I personally know 2 people antibodies. type 1 person O- blood type type 2 person O+ blood type. type 2 person got March.  know type 3 person.

So question cases per million, severity these? going get regardless. people high risk need stay F home they're not. folks sub love dogpile America way fetishized disaster pandemic. It‚Äôs part theatrics it. Meanwhile, nobody‚Äôs making fun Brazil that‚Äôs ghoulish thing anyone. Science says otherwise. course cough goes airborne. Driving job yesterday, located westchester, saw 2 florida plates 2 Ncarolina plates. Smh really hope crackdown, like states NY license plates. Good, fuck him. Let's honest: avoidable Trump endorsed April. Instead Fox, Trump, etc. pushed BS. US catastrophically bad situation honestly see way solve moment.

It could worked US would shut beginning everyone would wear masks, economy would taken hit country would already successfully reopened would minimized economic damage.

But no, guys commit measures economy already badly damaged, 140k already died even would shut would still see tens hundreds thousands deaths completely destroying economy cost many additional lifes.

It's really shitty around, matter on. feel really bad responsible Americans fucked government irresponsible citizens. know playing wide variety music makes better player? like play? Honestly want know. true, Arizona National average Sponsors, that‚Äôs got mean bubonic plague eventually died down... I've really never understood people focus deaths, real way showing virus supressed decrease daily cases (or lack case US places)

obviously deaths always awful, really show well country terms suppressing virus Amen actually find masks make people aware society's new extended bubble. Win win.  Flattening curve meant hospitals take control treat cases go zero.   no, let ppl carry shit virus isn‚Äôt real. loved ones start dropping dead get extremely sick, they‚Äôll wake hell up. tried gluten free diet gut? Actually, party get coronavirus. spread thing purpose petty vindication ‚Äúsee? one got it/no one died/it‚Äôs bad‚Äù.

Sure. People don‚Äôt deserve die one mistake. I‚Äôd also argue pretty egregious mistake tons warning signs everywhere. Both. constantly touching mask pose risk yourself. properly worn properly maintained mask provide protection wearer around them. Kind low bar wearing mask big deal. idiot wish make big deal it. sides play part making mask wearing political issue. Yikes. one badly.

Ok, far good, mostly places ‚Äúpeaked‚Äù virus new. 

This non-sensical, maybe care expand that? think coronavirus got start everywhere world January 1st? No, spreads, takes ‚Äúpeaking‚Äù opinion

It's opinion, beating record daily deaths every day last 5 days stats insanely different US countries nothing population.

We're talking past other, even disagree this. March 20th, would saying EU terrible job Arizona's public health system amazing? planet big place, took couple months virus spread communities every single area world. happening simultaneously. That's point I'm making. Comparing Arizona's numbers today EU pointless comparing March 20th, would make EU look bad Arizona look great. present rate death that‚Äôs loss nine million Americans. How'd get it? Threaten stop McDonalds didn't? U.S. 1 4 confirmed cases, c'mon guys. Canada 10 times less people less confirmed cases deaths. I'd love see guys improve enough trading us restart way border opened get shit together. already border city Windsor hotspot due large amount Windsorites working Detroit, across tunnel. basically exponential almost

noone could known. People dont realize employees actually quite lucky, since income. Without Disney reopening many would $$. everyone got approved PUA PUA also ends two weeks.

Cant expect people put food table roof head, cant work.

If government providing Universal Income like countries did, would support everything closed down, however case.

I one cannot work, places closed, arent hiring (budget cuts). got denied PUA idea hell Im paying rent August. wish could work right now.

Everyone screams ""CLOSE CLOSE CLOSE!"" dont look bigger picture many people cant sit ass day Sticking evil libz priceless. /s Arizona people see take mask talk 

A fellow co worker walked one foot front took talk. told can‚Äôt couldn‚Äôt understand it‚Äôs important Buh buh but... PER CAPITA!!! uncommon, unheard viral infections. people develop diabetes strong virus infection, regardless virus. main idea, IIRC, they're already pre disposed diabetes, overworked immune system infection finally triggers it. didn‚Äôt wish deaths. don‚Äôt sympathy. dude dies crashing motorcycle going 120. Lmao top post says ‚ÄúI need remind people sub you‚Äôre crazy supporting president...‚Äù like couldn‚Äôt make up. real number infected probably much much higher. Girlfriend, ya. Fun fact, used married Gavin fucking Newsom (democrat Governor California) like 2006. Found someone knows *fucking nothing* covid.

Did know catch it, even asymptomatic, still cause lung kidney damage? potentially long lasting. life-cycle

Lol what? rate, soon later, US citizens better part European Union back rule England. Thank you. seen heard much recently contraction rate mask wearer. informative read. Sigh. stupidity. they‚Äôre dying hospital rationalize minimize generally say stupid shit. Look testing! There's testing... EU. absolute number tests lower positivity rate lower, us Europeans tests per positive case US. let trump scam believing discrepancy case numbers way explainable discrepancy number tests performed. closed: bars. all. Oh, reduced restaurant capacity. 

Worst crisis political leadership century automoderator let us discuss that. someone dementia could replace with....   realise guys haven‚Äôt peak first wave yet right ? EU way guys slowed climb nowhere near peak yet unfortunately. can‚Äôt call ‚Äú peak ‚Äú beating new case records daily I‚Äôm making excuses us objectively untrue? LOL Glad you‚Äôve felt safer :) Young people get older people sick, still take hospital beds, Florida fast running of. too.  I'll surprised make first sip video without reaction half crowded... Maybe mean one thing House Democrats demanded without concession, return $25 billion border wall funding, Trump walked away from, 3 years ago, siccing ICE them? Yes. Ted Cruz voted relief Sandy. must also Midwest lol FYI click it, see Texas. much much larger testing infrastructure tracking commitment quarantine isolation do. saw ND app. Pasting verbatim -

Well, real sweeping communities. total case numbers death counts incomplete, work have, looking 5% death rate, pretty high, unlikely seeing world wide. population DuPage county 922K, roughly 100 times known infected people. average 0.5% death rate people seem claim also seeing reality, 100k people county infected, catching 1 10 infections. either testing slow virus much widespread, well, 0.5% number true context. average. think Manitoba gone... 10 days without new cases? we're sparsely populated exception rule. Man, almost bright tear reason. Thank you. guessing served. haven‚Äôt respect have. not. Thanks enlightenment buddy. want like grow up. Oh well. leave voice mail? fascinating Netflix documentary watch couple years we‚Äôre indoors due next pandemic. seriously suggesting nuke EU.

Lmao

E: wow sarcasm work apparently got done saying confused shithead. official campaign slogan Keep America Great. ‚ÄúDude know‚Äù -Jesus really, evolutionary pressure generally towards less deadly dead people can't spread. People think know better doctors scientists treat get covid instead taking away someone‚Äòs hospital bed becauz muh freedoms! seriously, sad.  pandemic 9/11... something transcended politics, affected every class citizen, needed actually leader, force hard choices, would secured legacy history. Well, secure legacy... president pretended disaster occurring afraid would make look bad. company measures place well next year. 

We're going back office limited numbers soon, one day week people zero days week high risk employees situation re-evaluated January 2021. Day late....dollar short...Per usual President shit talker.........talk shit something....then days later exact thing shit talking about....SMH...it‚Äôs late donnie. Part wonders non pandemic politicized everyone followed safety precautions where'd today. 

It sucks seeing states like Arizona like this, mean kind expected universal precautions taken dealing highly communicable sickness. city put mandate mask usage. $50 fine dont wear one. like night day everyone started wearing masks. chief police said cite anyone wearing one. mayor backed decision....everyone back wearing one. No, many morons states. mind numbing dense argument is. 

I would like word Boris one. ...okay, take one *those* folks. joking around. I'm hoping latter. Considering little testing, saying everyone needs test test, actively denying tests telling people self monitor, would inclined believe situation far worse official status says. 


That US undercounting deaths cases reported since April/May: example. 


This quite common actually, countries report fewer actual, mostly optics simply testing keep numbers low.

But yeah probably I'm paranoid cases disappear, go away end summer. That's viruses work...Moron. They're starting find evidence Covid-19 leave lasting lung BRAIN DAMAGE!

Imagine US already comparatively poor healthcare social support systems hundreds thousands extra disabled individuals.

The future's looking bleak fake news media taking staunch freedumb wear it, not, context. west Phoenix. Mexicans stay. know 7 people died past two weeks. happened fast. work Amazon come contact positive people least week. Work 2 3 new cases every week. feels inevitable I'll get it. hope hit hard give anyone thought wearing onion belt? Human-to-human conceded January 21.
Outbreak known well December 31. little part NY state, even big time Trump lovers wearing masks. ton confusion need one

It's really confusing flowchart:

Are public enclosed space? Yes wear mask. mask wee bit bigger covered whole head. Two weeks! Two weeks! Two weeks! I'm Utah. shop Harmon's masks required enter. felt safe. nice. Lack PPE high case numbers making Russians feel desperate. Perhaps Putin trying give people hope (and also hopefully prevent backlash people get desperate enough). trust man successfully use toilet exit it. read article? ‚Äúcovid 19‚Äù party. heard these? People get together see tests positive virus first compare Arizona EU? Japan? mayor town Indiana signed executive order trying get people wear masks inside. People going crazy Facebook now. FREEDOM!!!!! Absolute moron. happens spend long echo chamber. response Covid far ideal, especially first weeks... almost unhinged... vaccine point next year, normality return, UK recession (like everyone else) recover totally fine. Somewhere = White House .  Never said conspiracy. saying blaming disproportionate amount damage right. think 500-700k/day infected hundreds thousands even tested, theory infected people everywhere. feel differently guy mayor Atlanta tested positive? photographed without mask. hear anyone calling idiot. accidentally throw bowling balls time time, get knocked out, wake functioning brain. 

Sorry, felt like writing that. trying total dick, deniers make worse. uniquely American thing. see spikes parts world. (Anecdotal) know zero people went bought firearms cause pandemic. Lol exactly lot spread also due system failure. healthcare

Bingo We‚Äôre still like number 10 per capita deaths shutdowns. Important distinction make. States quick lift restrictions numbers started slow. Things didnt even really start go states racing reopen like would win biggly first. doesnt matter kind gathering shouldnt happening asking problems. scary thing even given pandemic real tangible threat data numbers still can't it. whole world recognized threat. still can't help community. rot anti-intellectualism fear republican party showing dangerous actually deal something real serious. Can't put fucking mask help thy neighbor. Fuck you.

If can't bring participate cooperative society around pandemic threat, ever. Well, hard believe since nowadays many people around world looks US aspirational goal like used be. US leaving international institutions, like WHO, left right.

The US might still powerful, definitely leading world used be. ever spoken Texas Republican? Every sentence pure hypocritical. stroke healthy pre-existing conditions form fashion. something diagnosed. pre-existing condition. tragic healthy sense body 100%. may able run marathon something going give early life. friend heart attack age 27 thing. nuke em article says ‚Äúalledges‚Äù meaning that‚Äôs even 100 percent confirmed. people probably treat party joke satire. dude died article states thought wouldn‚Äôt get it, wasn‚Äôt actively trying to. idiotic something someone could easily redeemed for. flash forward 60 years, old man different talking mistake made 20 year old attending covid party would want old man dead? No, person. wouldn‚Äôt want old man dead indeed nothing celebrate. young would plenty time change. difference texting driving going party coronavirus. Perfect picture... look dr eyes... 

Bless dr F Little. Late start fire. always burning since world's turning. producing numbers? Come Little. Late smoking cigarette telling go doctor wearing mask. It‚Äôs testament fellow New Yorkers, especially city. proud city, gained even hope, even watching rest country spiral. remained smart, vigilant, strong. Keep up, hope feels great. article states Britain third hardest hit country.... find strange though like deaths keep going down? tens thousands protesters congregating large crowds across country.

Of course there's new cases.

What would like know new cases - many asymptomatic?  know 30 people point tested positive. asymptomatic. Obviously that's sample group 30, make question headlines seeing.

Especially since we've somehow politicized illness. It‚Äôs testament fellow New Yorkers, especially city. proud city, gained even hope, even watching rest country spiral. remained smart, vigilant, strong. Keep up, hope feels great. Delete duplicate post government gave us $1200 10 weeks ago expected keep us home.

They expect keep us home. never intent. expected calm discontent government handling situation. literally least could do. *Someone work died Covid, first thing everyone asks old he, going help dismiss it. (Late 40s early 50s.)*

People try find excuse dismiss virulence virus. Truth told everyone 22 healthy. even 22 year olds healthy. people underlying conditions - whether know not. 

Nevermind virus around 6 months people claim expert it. barely know anything virus. latest heard respiratory virus rather organ virus - attacking heart, kidneys, brain, lungs, knows else. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs frustrating this. could worn mask beginning. followers would still love him. It‚Äôs like ignoring masks advantageous him. 

He delayed wearing doubling previous claims covid wasn‚Äôt big deal. Letting ego get way making right decision people you‚Äôre charge literally opposite textbook good leadership. Even ignore stupid stuff that‚Äôs going one, he‚Äôs fundamentally bad leader. I'm anti masker, I'm interested changing behavior punishing people. sadist wish - I'm sure find compatible company every level government. Smaller reported US numbers* best shot ending COVID-19 pandemic society develop ""herd immunity,"" term used tipping point enough population immune pathogen longer Widespread deployment coronavirus vaccine could get us there, still know (or even if) we'll one option wait enough people catch recover COVID-19 ‚Äî point, coronavirus antibodies blood grant natural immunity based new study Spain, second option reaching herd immunity may longer table coronavirus survivors' antibodies disappear.

Ebola virus eradicated vaccine something we've learned control containing hot spots. varying degrees success. 

If countries active cases shut long enough reduce active cases zero, increased ability detect virus communities (e.g. sewage testing example) virus would longer endemic communities.

And would matter containing outbreak. could help us least identify country that's home vector. /r/BrandNewSentence Whether herd immunity possible not, I'd like think global civilization human beings could handle pandemic slightly better bunch cows would. also people may spread whilst still pre-symptomatic  important number, looking make much sense. Maybe. police don‚Äôt really exist protect people criminals protect criminals people. Vigilantism tends respond disproportionately nature crime. Exactly caught COVID-19 three weeks ago. must grocery store work home member family leaves house. People don‚Äôt wear masks shit it.

Herd impunity. really true lot people get tested. Look Stockholm London. 20% herd immunity. course mean tested 20% London.

I‚Äôm ok it. long don‚Äôt see stars bars Woo actually really easy bankrupt casino planned poorly. 

Casinos huge overhead, they're big buildings, means big mortgages/leases/property taxes, require ton staff almost hours day. So, order cover overhead need lot customers coming in, playing games, buying overpriced food drinks, generally wasting money establishment. 

What means, need lot customers every casino city, essentially need tourism support one two. Las Vegas survives tons tourism, Macau. Atlantic City tourism enough local money support big casino, little multiple. 

Trump set casinos Atlantic city, spouting big plan turn city around, completely failed to. attract tourists, enough incoming money cover costs joints went under. 

It big, incredibly dumb risk, backfired spectacularly. looks better now. always hard say. Locking def saved lives, federal NY go 1st?

Some things nursing homes questionable. Netherlands model United States. re-opened schools less 1 new case per 100,000 residents. 

They opened phases, starting younger kids delayed middle high school reopening. 

They operating hybrid model kids go school half day time. 

The Netherlands wide scale testing adequate contract tracing

Face mask required everywhere people actually wear them.

I can't recall exact number kids classroom think capped 15 students per class.

If US meet conditions it, exactly feel safe, I'd feel risk low enough justify in-person schooling. US close meeting conditions, know closely watching news I'm Texas ICU's overburdened. 

But things change August, indication will, likely results closer Israel, also less 1 new case per 100,000 real safety measures I've seen people Trump 2020 masks walking around grocery store. much merchandizing opportunity seems, Trump-branded PPE seems completely opposite platform. cdc estimate 12 cases every 1 confirmed Thanks, likewise! mean cynic genuinely think capable - pulling shit together. may seen this: 


This system produces politicians leaders get public that's rotten too. seems we're seeing first hand system cannot better. hoax no, overblown yes. Oh yeah he's actually getting custom red mask made unveiling Lenin Statue Lafayette Square.

Not gonna lie though, mask isn‚Äôt bad look him. Makes actually look like proper world leader. he‚Äôd act like it. numbers likely substantial undercount complete death toll, since death counting takes time many states weeks months behind Good see bot remove political trash subs like this. Right. let's open schools.. hip hip hooray!!! numbers shouldn‚Äôt counted ‚ÄúCovid deaths‚Äù, though. Covid deaths deaths Covid. got true, tactic ""look me, nothing see there"" goto thing does.

Haha look weak stupid makes look /s dont live Michigan. I'm explaining places matter happens. 

Gov. Wolf made masks required. Even state police wearing masks .  Aww, god. little cream sauce it. Supposed 70%  definitely seen trump 2020 masks! says supported either?? Badum chhhhhh real number people infected probably WAY higher don‚Äôt know anyone ever expected herd-immunity.

I'm sorry society creates conditions victims prosecuted abusers protected. looks cool badass! Kind like Scorpion. followers feel cool shit wearing too. Man, sure wish looked good @POTUS. Yes, can‚Äôt speak whole state. say somewhere aren‚Äôt? absolutely speak city. don‚Äôt go lot places, talked LOT people, mask wearers anti-maskers. People saying there‚Äôs nothing anyone do. following. Employees probably closer 50%. Franchise stores better local, corporate offices set rules, even there, employees refused managers didn‚Äôt feel like fighting. time, fewer fewer. Costco 100%. place town know never heard exceptions, boy people pissed right off. Walmart probably second consistent employees, many masks right (around necks, head, etc.). Local grocery stores hit miss. 

Yes, salons barbershops stayed closed shutdown. opened, complied masks weren‚Äôt 100%, though require strictly fine. Even complainers. salons promoting, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt require masks!‚Äù Even required, PR. one policing it. closed, many people house calls anyway. known one anything. Plenty didn‚Äôt anything, know three women stylist come house. So, shop closed, going orders. sort hush hush. also, ‚ÄúI know she‚Äôd love business.....‚Äù may well open, see wanted please customers. 

Same restaurants. closed inside curnside pickup, mask wearing board. opened, everyone trying get people out. want employees draw fraction people coming limited capacity. restaurants strict employees. masks customers required moving around, everyone knew strict, wasn‚Äôt that. Again, local spots often no. I‚Äôm sure cost reason. spots, local franchise super strict. FB group restaurants people would like,‚ÄùDM places don‚Äôt require masks.‚Äù publicly would like, ‚ÄúTheir employees actually wearing masks faces!‚Äù way drew different crowds. liked masks safe places go didn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt bothered..

My point isn‚Äôt went places, friends coworkers did. left masks weren‚Äôt required, giving tips ‚Äúsafer‚Äù places go. like, ‚ÄúHey, go here, don‚Äôt wear masks.‚Äù Like ‚Äúlittle tip ya freedoms!‚Äú know? live here.

And honest, guess don‚Äôt want police spending time anyway. Let idiots idiots get line hospital, guess. sucks infect others willful ignorance. right. Dammit.  Sorts Conservative.. mean Controversial. Finally well-being country important pride Yes, houses still catch fire, people still heart attacks, pipes still burst, robberies still occur, domestic violence still happens, etc etc etc etc Cue conspiracy theorists saying libs made it, mean anything Right, that's huge gap information data. Honestly way things heading might never ever accurate good enough data really sort out. Probably need data controlled countries decent sense. think alone speaks level failure US. I'll probably wait November. virus traveling time, now? We're fucked. Nice see someone knows secret. I‚Äôve always found last three weeks January ideal tome go. PogChamp  Questions:

1. Trump make public statement, recommending ordering people wear masks.
2. DeSantis issue statewide mask order Florida?
3. states still need mask orders? What‚Äôs logic original shutdown reopening. Clearly it‚Äôs much worse control now. remember county still zero cases. remember country hit 100,000 total. new numbers insane, hard even look them. think little fingers would able stay away spotlight long. (d)eaths though Wow! MAGA - Masks Great No, downgrade compatible today's international market. need something new fix bugs, bring back past ones. thinking making Trump 2020 masks would great way get morons actually wear them. must say, it‚Äôs lovely little break look smarmy fucking face. Nothing do. told offer mask nothing else. aren‚Äôt allowed refuse service. I‚Äôm probably wrong doesn‚Äôt mask look little off? Like looks higher quality video almost like edited on?Are videos pictures mask? relationship really taken beating throughout this. girlfriend isn‚Äôt quite ‚Äúbad‚Äù it, doesn‚Äôt take thing seriously. think it‚Äôs least partially fact she‚Äôs essential worker going work whole time, entire family. think people like that, it‚Äôs harder real appreciation magnitude what‚Äôs happening. lives never really changed much throughout this, lives know. world kinda going like usual them. really need step outside try see different perspective one life offering them, that‚Äôs always easy do. 

Like day, told coworker tested positive Covid. asked gonna do, said closed place deep cleaned weekend. like... doesn‚Äôt really help somebody caught dude comes back Monday rest you. didn‚Äôt seem care. wonderful day Canada, therefor course, world. read anti-mask FB group day masks mass witchcraft induction. worry long term. going see massive rates lung failure (or knows else) 30 years ‚Äúcovid kids‚Äù? Every day bigger mess. county Florida doubling every 8 days üòØ Couple states lots cases rn swing states lol also evidence herd immunity covid 19 natural occuring process 

Antibody levels seem show get herd immunity letting go population

Vaccine seems way reach herd immunity going back normal eradicated country stay home border controls batshit insane stupid Well fucking hard it, said 135,000 dead Americans.  people don‚Äôt need validation news source confirm intelligence, exposed every day

Lmao

""I need newspaper telling what's what. walk around trailer park ask Jimbo truth"" could made ton money selling MAGA masks, would rather start conservative death cult. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! None cult give shit. They're acceptable casualties eyes. first town first positive test person 4th July event like 100's people weekend. Wonder people take semi seriously not. know 20+ people coronavirus. website full people huffing farts basements scared case number refuse acknowledge recovered number, real much seem refuse believe it. 

When case number goes up, fatalities obviously go along recoveries. case numbers spike beyond system's ability handle it, casualty rate increases people unable receive care. fact people survive irrelevant, still pointless deaths soon spike reason along lasting organ damage. many people *do* die consider serious enough blithely make jokes basement! Tape windows! giant fart cloud covid gonna get ya!

My brother asthma mother elderly. Unfortunately, no. Maybe 2 pound dumbbells I‚Äôm curls part, I‚Äôm starting scratch. I‚Äôm barely able get 20 push-ups knees 40 squats. It‚Äôs sad. Trump openly mocks military problem selling highest bidder. knew Russia bounties nothing.  business around injured military last thing need get covid19 staff. Ahh that's shame.. great ground footage BLM protests country. look majority cases are, see (R)etards are. thing is, even vaccine becomes ineffective cause virus mutated, able tweak make effective said mutate strain strains. focus safety trials much cause already done them, meaning able push faster next mutation. meaning even fail first try cause virus mutated, successful next try getting vaccine mutate. Sounds incredibly low, especially less 2% die it. That's like, 2% 1%... dunno math that's small.

I feel like headline mistake makes dumbasses like go ""Oh wow, basically nothing"" perspective: Vermont son got results 2 days- primary care doctor ordered test thru community hospital. primary care doctor thus allowed testing pop-up site. results took 4 days.  apparently significant increase covid driven protests 20k+ people squeezed together, yelling/screaming outside. 

It looks like impossible spread outside. Quite low mortality low along lines existing common flu strain, lower similar covid type strains - clearly virulent. 

More anything enough accurate data may actually never enough quality data. giving anti-science crowd much ammunition. anti-vax people to. Even pro-science people feel like can‚Äôt trust CDC anymore. r/leopardsatemyface thugs run around tearing statues abolitionists. Because, y'know... stupidity. 

*And* drugs, I'm sure. Sounds like you‚Äôre taking safety seriously inconveniences you. Shame didnt. life decided care someone Keep safe good luck. Fauci deserves person year, hopefully dedication pandemic helping America gets recognized soon. must medical order  in, public health order even power ignore. *""I'm favor masks. I've favor masks longer anyone else think. liberal conspiracy try convince conservatives wear masks, want us go church open schools. conspiracy win election November. fooled Democrats, wear mask. That's always say saying.""*  Sounds right.

Patients lingering symptoms seem pointing 90-100 day window. I've heard time frame cited times.

I wish could get formalized studies this, however. Mild moderate cases make them, seem largely ignored many studies. Real Americans put choke hold viruses tell them, ""stop replicating get test results!"" Starting wonder may early March. Headache, loss taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, abdominal discomfort. Lasted week far main symptoms fine. stayed home even slept separate room wife catch anything. never issues. never fever aches anything. Taste smell returned week too.  Yes base enough win unless gets level ""the country overrun pandemic"". simply high enough economic health outcomes current state. Part states, I'm pretty sure people traveling right kids flying summer visitation could released guidelines instead pretending exist. Hero Texas State allows Mail Votes?

Because way pandemic spreading control there, might well burn ballots they're going allowed vote locations closed. Wow, he's right, look stupid wearing thing.  best textbooks saying it! Many cities Florida not. Source get age, sensible politicians trying right thing age group. adherence ideology reality willingness lie his, party's goals, render unfit office.

There younger pols spouting lies is. 

Whatever age, vote anti-science willfully ignorant seemily determined increase spread covid idiots. May make three suggestions? almost every state new england higher death rate spain, italy UK mortality rate lagging indicator. statistics consider hospitalization rate, ICU usage rate, ventilator usage rate. statistics excellent predictor mortality rate weeks. workplace isn‚Äôt even letting us back office there‚Äôs vaccine. US always want # 1 world. Bravo! Well done, sir. took four months, he's finally done it. report symptoms asymptomatic person? Saying concerns medical workers influenced statement admitting lying.

Here [video Nothing says lie. Welcome asshole club everyone. everyone make sure tell he‚Äôs good boy listening doctor. Yes double surgical masks better 1. Also standard lots medical workers n95 surgical top really say wear masks surgeon general Fauci switched motives said wear them? first criticize terrible things he's done, I'll applaud finally getting right, even months late. Bottom line shit save lives.  People within conservative circles generally smart enough see past FUD media foisting us. read CDC reports weekly, that's enough.

You try it. nice think while. exactly problem non testing late results. People known chance covid-19 going business infecting people waiting test results 3 10 days. covid-19 mess compared much world. Put cone maff. 1/4 US public oh look. done March A) claim forced Democrats

B) we've always believed masks help virus. liberals said form control. Thanks providing point view. hope anything regret case get downvote bombed. 
I'll add ^^^  /s  They‚Äôre social distancing disney Note self: make masks animal theme. little elephant trunk hanging off, rhino tusk, dog nose w/ tongue. Look that, capitalism physicians official organization penned letter. That's definitely health officials saying ok go protest. exactly point making. based upvotes, quite manage understand. guess know correlation mean applies 100% people.  Yep, weak request Texans wear masks ‚Äúat least tried.‚Äù I'm laughing hard legitimately hurts. I'm also flashbacks ill good old private Catholic school lol

Cheers üòÇüòÇüòÇ  Covid related, one things I've combat classroom students put porn star names Kahoot. I'll make delete it, always ask why, fully knowing answer. need come good excuse next time happens. Ahh yes, hello Nope, bars aren‚Äôt getting money foreseeable future. much ‚Äústupid‚Äù there. go run light jog fresh air tv off. base going even confused Sorry :-/ Flights still operating countries, they'll deny entry PR citizen found couple days ago freaked schools. internal CDC report said safe fully open schools infection rate longer rising, falling. even measures (15 fewer kids per classroom, cohorting keep kids contained class daily basis, etc). 

The NY Times published couple days ago, sent White House end June.

Trump want CDC telling people safe fully reopen schools fall went ballistic. complete faith S.K. government get outbreaks control... wish could say USA. dumb still afraid this? True. two unreported concussions high school helped form coaching discipline safety injury prevention first. Helps players lot long run avoided lot season injuries past. What‚Äôs really scary WI residents WI Supreme Court nullified governor‚Äôs state emergency extension. power usually rests executive branch, WI saw fit remove that. sure emergency declared, since Gov must work state legislature.

Just don‚Äôt bring IL please thanks. hospital, wore strong PPE, except goggles. got home eyes burned 5 days. bad every news article keeps telling us ""POC"" disproportionately getting COVID, dying COVID. ""POC"" (i.e., black people) vote Democrat.

But hey... ""party science"", *you* explain BLM protests *aren't* source increased infection, especially compared ""open economy"" protests. can't wait hear tap-dancing...  took need distraction. Namely Roger Stone. Probably told allowed without mask. I‚Äôve always used site, others similar. Admittedly, recent weeks IFR dropped 5% month ago. think testing definitely improved. Imagine many lives could saved he'd done day 1, instead boost election odds. Thank you!

I'm keeping fingers crossed next week. doubt data, flu flu season. colder. Breathing problems worse winter overall. 

I hope data still right gets colder. want save lives turn A/C indoors Florida public spaces use fans. A/C causing spike. removes humidity viruses hate humidity. course Fall coming means reduced humidity everywhere. Check snapchat map stories... Also shows protesters mainly wearing masks  1300 health professionals signed letter stated ‚ÄùAs public health advocates condemn gatherings risky Covid-19 transmission.‚Äú

That‚Äôs close saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine‚Äù gets you‚Äôre advocating stalking harassing people minding business? Mind business Karen! Lol, yup. Human sauce is. Absolute truth abnormal number people dying, covid Horse barn door that. Proactive, nice work They're dying meet  weird people claiming North East want argue use A/C South. don't. use mine super hot nights uncomfortable sleep 85+ degrees home. know people acting defensive weird it. worked well enough could get enough hands could seriously end Covid 19. sound like Sweden know love  Yes. 6 feet really enough went reports Feb/March would much like 6 feet! employees. state tourists know till return home. sad news worthy, months now. Media genius Disneyworld also requiring masks mostly outdoors. sure? look data Austin September even chart. Peak around December. Oh, know will. Already family member nearly die. dumbasses got voted for. Ivanka coughed ""daddy laptime"". Speed fine. We‚Äôve done 70,000 tests since February. population 1.34 million reference. Also forget lot patients die causes, like car accident, counted COVID victims COVID found system fact, even nothing death.

This mainly true larger case areas, like New York, hospital gets money COVID cases non.

But serious factor consider nonetheless. news media posts stories like saying rest Republican leadership pulled rug him. He's national Repub left still resistant advocate face mask wearing. However, still, sections base rabidly it. example, I'd bet Fox News applaud this, OANN ignore pretend never happened. ~30% population equate masks tyranny

Which shows insanely stupid STATE: Hey guys, we'd really like everyone wear mask, public health. We're going fine anything, we'd really like help, businesses refuse service mask. again, going go jail THEM: TYRANNY!!! Anyone remember Alien encounter attraction? pre show little alien Skippy got zapped one side other, ended getting fried right asked volunteers... guess congratulations you‚Äôre volunteers great experiment Would people 'famous' momentarily featured *The Atlantic*, chance?

Wait... sorry... *no* one lies sick are, *especially* something superficial mention national magazine.

Every time mother-in-law told ""the *worst* cold *ever*"", believed her. Sincerely, people lie health. What‚Äôs going Oregon. anything opening yet? I‚Äôm Seattle King County phase two. think state 355 new cases yesterday. black mask also turn orange Also, BLM protests outside COVID-19 harder time spreading. Can‚Äôt throw patients knows he‚Äôs full shit. problem supporters don‚Äôt. amazes many bad coaches are. It‚Äôs insane coaches treat water breaks like reward human right don‚Äôt know use ice baths cool players get sick.

I respect smart coaches. fake tough guy bullshit always grated me. Besides, scariest coach ever dealt softball coach. cut players bad ad reporter, threw away stuff. like damn, I‚Äôm printing that, that‚Äôs mean lol. He'd never admit mistake, he'd definitely say, ""I always masks, know, masks great thing, best masks. started wearing masks, nobody wore them, know that?"" Surely turn things around now! always get beds, tents, ect, need staff. Paramedics skills intubate, work vents, push meds, surgical airways, chest tubes, without Drs direct order. work written protocols, protocols could easily adjusted. plan worst may come paramedics stay working ICU ERs, volunteers bringing ambulances, buses, personal vehicles ect. someone needs life saving treatment house, might able hold basic first aid skills volunteers make all. That‚Äôs least amount harm may actions cities take. worst case, best action IMO MADE CHY-NA Wait Fox actually consider *not* part mainstream media, also calling America's ""Most watched news channel""? What's saddest thing breaking news helping me... 5-7 days Someone probably told wore people would stop talking Roger Stone. people flying get Covid Disneyworld? Vote. Him. OUT!

Vote EVERYONE like OUT!

thank you. thousands us get test order get surgery...knowing (hoping) negative...and drives number tested/number positive. 

The letter got testing center said something like, ""Because tested doctor must suspected positive. So, act positive."" 

I stay inside two days surgery even though wife wanted go ride something. risk it. gluten four weeks felt awful. helps population state Maine you‚Äôre bit smaller size Texas much. frozen things long time ago. figured something else out. We're world hurt. much nearly complimentary enough TRUMP!!! Amazon months Photo op fight get it. It‚Äôs legit family trying get grandpa dementia something sane. something improve time, heart damaged permanently? Correct. whole point reduce ‚ÄúR‚Äù value ‚Äú1‚Äù effectively stop rapid spread disease. Exponential spread disease terrifying thing look numbers. Everything looks fine suddenly ‚Äúit‚Äôs really fine‚Äù nothing it. Kawasaki Disease asshole (Sen. Cornyn), absolutely unacceptable reach 1% U.S. getting infected. Every country without populist least wrote masters thesis suspected could case people started reporting long term effects.

You want take chances virus. Protect yourself, loved ones, community. fuck. expect this, really darkened day.

Think cheese guy sin city... ugly motherfucker. understand trying say. saying left all, left far left enough? former completely untrue. Well Michigan thread. Michigan, Gov Whitler actually shit. I'm telling already happening they're stopping people doors multiple businesses went today last week. 

And parroting police wearing masks absurd. ordered wear identified job. conspiracy. accepted job risk order keep accountable everything else you. anyway let courts fight out. Might buy us time. know honestly. work today. healthcare corporation enslaves directly contracted Disney guest temp screenings. personally know details Disney handling reopening parks themselves, could probably find out. jointed corporations are, I'll learn eventually. 


Nothing improve unified response. like broken arm. cast cure bone. support arm heals own. Lockdowns, mask mandates, etc. going cure pandemic. Time will. time arm casted, person going need lot help. Likewise, public need significant support pandemic control contact tracing properly implemented national scale. However, United States system support people outside passing series spontaneous stimulus packages get argued time. such, seeing fallout: evictions, job loss, economic depression. like hoping someone help activities daily living get then, ever happens, rather visiting nurse home health aide regularly coming help cast come off. 


There anything Disney, non-essential business, stop spread pandemic outside shutting down. non-essential business reopens contribute rise cases. Disney attempting *minimize much contribute* spread.  cases don‚Äôt test! studies going vaccines like TB see protective effect either totally preventing least ensuring people mild case coronavirus.

I hope turns true would allow lot people get least partial protection faster brand new vaccine. know make it, facilities already making normal use, unsafe give vaccinate. THANK MUCH! appreciate it! worth noting places need negative test boarding upon entry. Obviously perfect system it‚Äôs something. would hug 2020 hard got virus.

When wake realize destroy chances average people tactic? left lose election again, guarantee it. I‚Äôm reading lot contradicting material long term immunity COVID19. say recovered individuals maintain immunity form antibodies years. Others show low even absence antibodies despite firm tested diagnosis infected recovering it. 

The disease giving varied set results - affecting lungs, never affecting lungs, affecting many organs, many showing symptoms mild symptoms. 

You could fine, kinda sick, sick, die. possibilities. due damage live virus caused infection period rather process creating antibodies? Yeah, we‚Äôre 4 months in? point gets missed lot ^^^ well said Hopefully finally put end medical community pretending ME/CFS psychosomatic disorder.

We need serious research field ... Looks like even Florida scares him. can't wait see media spins favor. mean right wing channels fox news.  used site help us determine park go when. pretty useful!

I‚Äôve ever gotten pick eye life gnat flew kid. Critical thinking mandatory course  remember taking grade 11. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs many course syllabus  again. Critical thinking breeds bad consumers sorry hear - got shingles vaccine soon heard it, even though I'm little 'recommended' age studies I've seen IFR somewhere .4% .6%. That's significantly higher .1%, nearly terrifying media portrays, vast majority deaths elderly. millennial younger gets .1% IFR range. 

The fact killed close 140k US lot people. US also loses 40k every year opioid epidemic, hits much younger demographic. death good, obviously, preventable death much worse, perspective necessary politics thing gotten control. believe social repercussions media's handling right *and* left going outlast disease. 

We've needed facts hard information media clear direction leaders. Instead we've gotten shit. news agencies god damn useless we're entering new sort dystopia. Manufacturing consent taken extreme. One percent 3,290,000 people. Two percent 65,800. 2% died Twice max number people normally die flu died less six months, including hottest time year typical flu. still deal full pandemic US plus flu winter.

What numbers support looking OK? Trump masks like opposite princess Diana kids aids. Um Puerto Rico America. Hijacking comment, important find Cordyceps made properly. Fruiting Bodies, Hot Water Extract measured Beta-D-Glucans key things looking for.... Example would  MAGA masks exist... thought Disney World opened ago murica rights! /s Thank following through! make better drinks home anyway. Drinks bar like box chocolates, ya know?

Also, like martinis extra dirty, order dirty bar get less booze drink. home, make half strong, drink twice many, pay double it. tiles? Like upset bled tiles offering semblance sympathy help. Awwwww poor thing could breathe?! Also, false pretenses. lie means know telling truth. Ah ok gotcha. someone going address real threat. Tuberculosis killing people CV. shutdown need TB shutdown nazi Republicans tell, there's real ""left"" US. ""Anybody, right now, yesterday, anybody needs test, gets test. They're there. test. And, tests beautiful. Anybody needs test, gets already settle this? Long live Confederacy! Situation really, *really* bad Mexico :( someone Texas, went full stupid, I'm sorry. I'm also scared shitless we're starting look exactly like New York coming April. week ending July 4, CDC reported ‚ÄúAmong 186 hospitalized children information underlying conditions, 51.6% least one reported underlying medical condition. commonly reported obesity, asthma, neurologic conditions.‚Äù banned restricted places Georgia (country). Laura Jane Grace said Twitter: ""I‚Äôm sure imagine hell worse Disney World, Orlando, Florida, July, middle plague""...so true. many close tested positive....more know probably. wear mask one focus Ghislain Maxwell, Roger Stone, Russias soldier bounty, ya, thats ticket. AC 24/7

Its almost personal preference thing...

You assume everyone likes indoor temperature management preferences like you? That‚Äôs stupid simplistic way look it, culture oppressive minorities everywhere (especially US THO) need sorry. feel like collectively NYC went pretty traumatic experience lot us trouble watching rest US cusp were. new type anxiety watching hospitals fill states senseless. wonder gone hospital trouble breathing moving. I'm close woodhull obviously ended calling 911, idea damage done body. keep playing covid effects stress? reason people saw bad scary completely unable connect could happen live. 

A lot people I've talking lately much reliving early days sorting now. watch again. I've seen lot people saying, stuff like low level crimes jail. sure correct. Here, CO, released man prison, covid excuses, low level offender. Next week arrested murdering woman young 20s.  imagining half-full rollercoaster people arms crossed mouths shut surgical masks dangerously close flying faces landing somebody's funnel cake. 

This seems like GREAT idea. Way fun. likely goes every country Yeh thought that. takes time deaths catch up.

NYC shut 5,000 cases/day. Texas, Arizona Florida going potentially collapse anarchy. waiting infected die. maybe figures Andrew Cuomo sent Covid positive patients nursing homes.

Or maybe lockdowns wrecked economy, without functioning economy none exalted scientists would able get funding (oh wait, government save us forever).

Or maybe there‚Äôs fact virus going absolutely nowhere there‚Äôs cure vaccine. realize brainwashed mind probably forgot this, supposed shut 2 weeks ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù. eliminate virus message seems morphed into. 

So, either continue lockdowns mask mandates forever, get back normal let burn way population. Yes people die, could even me. People die every single day. Somehow human race managed survive.

I‚Äôm curious. sanctimonious redditor saving lives, many times mask flu season? many times go work sick? many times texted driving?  Hmm? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

*manipulating, necessarily right thing. really think depends generation upbringing. mother father hippies. uncle aunt not. sets polar opposite right now. 69% go herd immunity! Giggity. college announced three employees tested positive COVID week, two hospital. fall semester hasn‚Äôt even started yet. Deaths infections also reported government officials. Men weaker immune systems average, less surprise.  


The double edged sword general women likely get auto-immune diseases. followers must confused right now. Thoughts prayers. (I know it‚Äôs shitty say I‚Äôm really really tired idiocy. Actions - case, inaction - create consequences.) Hope decent life insurance. top five states new deaths Florida, California, Arizona, Texas New Jersey.

It‚Äôs invisible virus. OMG BILL GATES BRAINWASHED DEAR LEADER! must‚Äôve micro chipped 5G!!! Someone call OAN... Hospital administrators might well want see COVID-19 attached discharge summary death certificate. Why? straightforward, garden-variety pneumonia person admitted hospital ‚Äì¬†if they're Medicare ‚Äì typically, diagnosis-related group lump sum payment would $5,000.

Scott Jensen, R-Minn., physician Minnesota, interviewed by¬†""The Ingraham Angle""¬†host Laura Ingraham April 8 Fox News claimed hospitals get paid Medicare patients listed COVID-19 get three times much money need ventilator. Aka nationwide lockdown Yeah. Sadly era signed /s. probably many people view millions dead big deal. (And million lifetime health complications). cool. stepped bro, commend that: definitely proud. 

I'm planning voting mail coerced spouse arguing keeps poll workers safer. (Really hoping states come around mail-voting.)

Training Zoom interesting. Hopefully old-timer call something novel show day election. Stay Safe.  doubly important democratic process. Anecdotal mask wearing nonexistent Netherlands (except public transport) got hold pandemic. It‚Äôs part puzzle. That's good point. friends whose kids reverse; 3yo worried mask on, speaking (closed) picture window. Great contribution. much average American know anywhere else World? Absolutely nothing. guys barely know anything Canada Mexico, neighbours. Meanwhile rest world educated several different countries, opens mind, makes less racist, tolerant, etc. That‚Äôs one example. Americans know America &amp; American propaganda, leading insane amount patriotism, around dumbassary didn‚Äôt say could things. point viruses things one knows one capable long term it‚Äôs new. Could be. good. Someone else posted text article. :) way too.soon 100% accurate number. 

There need investigations reporting official death tolls almost certainly estimates based comparison average death rates previous years. Yeah probably poor wording, mystery happened meant lamenting kind way believe so. kids I'm sure think it, honest. However, legitimately bad say getting over-played, happens kids going school give parents, grandparents, etc.? parents likely go work spread work places. teachers? teachers catch students, happens? come school sick infect kids?

If Covid played nefarious reason, pandora's box sure. I've hearing 20 30 year olds dying disease, affecting elderly. True, cuz I'm stupid.

üòÖ  Sweden okish. 

We can‚Äôt shut again, it‚Äôll lead complete economic ruin isn‚Äôt worth Great website COVID info. Almost good site 17 year old kid put together. giving evil company company, giving Facebook traffic. habits harming world leave daughter. I‚Äôve heard herd immunity may ever happen antibodies fade within weeks some. lmao stuck 137,000 confirmed deaths month half bro. I'm sure today's number would lot higher adequate diagnosis protect eau claire! love town!

edit: blame MN. wore one Ford plant May well though rich get richer every bit of
it. That's naive interpretation seasonal influence.  UV HV/AC systems made back so... thats brainer think problem somewhat expensive maintain troublesome maintain typical 1% like take care of.... anecdotal know two people tested positive. One got results 8 days, wait 11. county, too. still pay testing, lots people might infected getting tested. Week week rapidly rising. believe huge public hangings future. la Nuremberg Trials. going get numbers years account ""pneumonia"" deaths deaths caused unavailable hospital bed and/or people willing go hospital risk getting covid died result lack treatment.

These actual deaths much much higher know today course, we'll people calling numbers ""Fake"" good good econometrician able design model able find this. goddamned hell people? 8 Even still need job you? see adds Facebook company‚Äôs making them. focus mostly liberals feelings. don‚Äôt even think conservatives making feel like I'm Grand canyon, I'm repeatedly watching tourists drive edge horror. signs everywhere warning cliff's edge people ignoring driving right by. like watching cult people, screaming top lungs, flipping plunging deaths. try stop aggressive sure get.

It's fucking insane watching exact story play Pandemic, politicians still bumbling around ignoring it. Well, least made far. Wonder we'll around watch world burn rest way down... nuts. mean, eventually, hit point reaches everyone flaunting health guidelines. slow able reach (as many) people taking seriously. far that? still get mild infection protect yourself. point measures decrease risk getting exposed larger dose virus keep virus getting lungs. Smaller doses contained upper respiratory tract. Text link below: 

‚ÄúAlthough known human coronaviruses infect many cell types, mainly cause respiratory infections. difference four cause common colds easily attack upper respiratory tract, whereas MERS-CoV SARS-CoV difficulty gaining hold there, successful infecting cells lungs.

SARS-CoV-2, unfortunately, efficiently. gives two places get foothold, says Shu-Yuan Xiao, pathologist University Chicago, Illinois. neighbour‚Äôs cough sends ten viral particles way might enough start infection throat, hair-like cilia found likely job clear invaders. neighbour closer coughs 100 particles towards you, virus might able get way lungs, says Ha, Americans fucking obsessed money. true. first amendment rights staying inside much possible social distancing (along wearing masks) needs happen. course masks help, prevent catching virus contagious one. Youre way behind talking points herd immunity people now? exploding cases US due shitty leadership Trump. countries hit nearly hard lead morons. Maybe update different times? Worldometer updates end day GMT, CDC probably eastern central time. Leave Zeus this, man. elect first time. People need see actual number 1% lot see think it‚Äôs 1% that‚Äôs big deal people get flu every year.  could‚Äôve told Poor little dudes. convinced one grandparents going die within next year. done nothing praise places still reopening. They've talked go eat told masks bad health. 80s. pretty sure going grandpa goes grandma get relatively mild (at least worse flu) case still double ""just flu"", maybe ""God reason everything. painful watching people love stubborn childish everything might actually kill now.

The fact tabloids passed news factual, social media enables echo chamber it, big problem country. literally killing people now. Within week. Fuck mean. made calculated bet virus , far bet wrong . remember , president put optics science health American people . administration well aware implications choices making . Keep head up! Hopefully affect much all. went quarantine fun. would suggest lot water/powerade. Also, force eat even 0 appetite, make big difference. worried oxygen levels would suggest getting one finger pulse meters. like 30-50 bucks great peace mind us.


edit: spelling 134k deaths, would put actual total US covid cases around 20 million... least 1 20 americans already virus. Welp, doubling buckling down. Better snatch oximeter fly shelves. wrong guy?!? Oh right!! death cult, death cult, forgot that.... begs question: legislators, despite info, continued mislead public safest practice political gain, resulting illness &amp; death, could face class-action suits/mass torts/whatever-it‚Äôs-called group litigates? not?

  maybe Nuremberg crimes-against-humanity-style reckoning? Probably USA supposed lead example much better infrastructure (you'd think) deal pandemic, also considered 1st world country Brazil India 3rd world developing countries. 
 
But hey, good job pulling similar numbers two developing nations equipped handle pandemic. one fucking cares said March knew next nothing. Dismissing experts fucking dangerous.  positive count GGO, fibrous stripe thickening adjacent pleura gradually decreased, GGO fibrous stripe showed obvious resolution first week third week discharge, it‚Äôs hard stop everyone act. Wow, new disinformation narrative gold. guys really going that? We've finished telling disinformation shills deaths rising yet reporting lag. deaths climbing going deaths actually rising reporting lag.

Pure gold. kidding, don‚Äôt forget - try mentally go someplace else. Thanks, yes exactly looking for. Cheers! Lol everything America politics. New Jersey New York suffered catastrophic failures due nursing home policy yet one wants talk it. sounds lot realistic .26%  positive count GGO, fibrous stripe thickening adjacent pleura gradually decreased, GGO fibrous stripe showed obvious resolution first week third week discharge, lungs clear scar tissue. scary. said hey goodbye romance yeah
Goodbye friends you
Goodbye past
I guess we'll meet, we'll meet end selling Trump branded campaign masks probably worst fro them. They're dependent help upkeep household. know Hyderabad finally said transient help needs stay put they're super carriers. middle class aunt never cleaned life. me? don‚Äôt wanna stuck here.

Family members likely morbidities, lot genetic.They're likely similar immune systems presumably they've exposed stuff. Etc. rip? Like, saying I'm dumb reading would help less dumb? agree there. pre, post infection? I'm gonna go pre. I've watching since Jan 23 reported news 32 dead 50 million quarantined China. Week 100 million. 
Blind Freddy knows 23 dead. every country reported various reasons. Italians knew grandma going die better die bed amongst loved ones. 
What got country managed handling dead. respect Italians military take bodies away night parade. happened Ecuador makes know never want go there. cannot treat grandma's body respect tourists chance. McMaster wants reopen schools next month. Ridiculous. Texas, Florida Georgia current hotspots (and also think California Arizona)  Yikes. There‚Äôs arguing people like that. It‚Äôs sick many Americans would rather risk spreading disease mildly inconvenienced wearing mask staying home.

When laughed isolating, thought was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hurting anyone staying home. potentially hurting people so.‚Äù good people understand exponential spread... Ironically Americans become diseased travellers one else wants country. That‚Äôs fucking awesome! Search specifically reddit, know I've seen it. Well, US sure aiming that. infection rates brought control soon, we'll see 10% infected. point become almost impossible getting infected.

And keep mind, action taken now, takes two weeks show effect numbers. assuming current growth rate continues like this, \~80k new cases per day two weeks, another million people got virus. three weeks we'll 95k new cases per day another 600k cases.... course, assumes data get accurate. we've learned multiple sources data several states publish reliable data China Russia. likely worse see. Meanwhile could afford foot bill us get treated. \*Fuck Chinese *government* :D  Community colleges city offered online classes since 1998! 90% online fall (and pandemic ends/ subsides). certain welding nursing classes need held person held. also believe tuition waved vast majority attendees.

Edit: summer classes free tuition, tuition expensive begin with. chinese.

You believe word, say even questions.

\-they covered outbreak since november

\- silenced whistleblower early dec

\- letting infected people travel around world closing air-travel china

\-reject help us countries

\-controlled mislead people

\- spreading fake news origin virus

(first blame Italy, US, doesnt stick, started blaming black people, version stick, saw countless videos china, example: didnt provide medical care blacks, one ..)

(remember claims said chinese state television) 

\- epidemic curve absolute joke, flat lines big ccp meeting Xi, big guys, search that, meeting everything fine instant. lot lung damage involves scar tissue Usa number 1! case, YOLO! Source? checked every person color US? irritates people spread virus health care workers put risk take care privileged politicians refused listen science Doctors.

Even worse likely given priority status everyone else hospitals end including taking precautions wearing masks-- masks magical cloak invincibility... one part many steps lower risk infection. Yet cant wont able foreseeable future. passport useless. Thats confuses most. must (minimum) dozens people telling multiple times day hurt chances enforce basic common sense i.e. masks, shutdowns, testing etc. side board fun... /s conclude false positive? Except received need double lung transplants this. Way early say lung damage reversed within weeks recovery months this. Like damn insecure little turd then. Yes do. enough cover mouth nose like winter morning. I‚Äôm 10 11.  make clear role police things like this. Defund police doesn‚Äôt mean abolish. means reconfigure public safety officers without weapons. 

Nuance. Rising how? Positive test rate fluctuates b/w .8 1.3% day. flatlined. Yes it‚Äôs like people testing positive going Disney World. also people recovered expired. Imagine mask says ‚ÄúMake America Great Again.‚Äù would made shit ton money conservatives maybe would start wearing really need way people able sell, swap, American citizenship. know people would happily trade places you. Win / Win Sure, that's something affects whether someone lives dies

There evidence won‚Äôt grow new eyeballs months

Do get people? shitty fucking logic. make statement disease says there‚Äôs proof ‚Äúx‚Äù months, virus months old therefore longer study technically impossible. doesn‚Äôt mean anybody listen that. listen happens viruses/coronaviruses, get immunity them.

How ""thousand carriers"" shit job spreading virus?

Maybe can't deal possibility good government cooperative populace better job countries. Maybe helps justify shitty response nations think everyone inevitable.

Because not, NZ place beating this.  ignored footnotes page get hes saying similar issue. numbers, holding anything head. Give food order ticket still look like 5 times making order. cant process way make orders (though sense time also fucked effects effective ordering food is), dont remember details want double check mental voice hasnt replaced mild wings hot boneless. mind hasnt given mental image breaded eggplant rather veal patty. 
I know ""order operations"" process something visual. Like I'd understand wings boneless boneless listed first ticket sauce option. Something circled often ignored rather emphasized. 

Its definitely applicable numbers. things dont stay present head try move onto next step applying them, I'd trouble Information visually front me. find ways around it, like plates represent order. Putin wear mask, actually Bolsonaro fucker not. make sure deathbed pray God either keep 100 day comes. Herd immunity comes vaccines, happen naturally. half months actually shutdowns daily briefings president (useless briefings least acknowledged virus). federal plans even acknowledge virus, states opening back forcing people back work, unemployment benefits running end July, eviction loan forgiveness running soon, third country refusing wear masks freedom. going long war absolutely routed first battle. proved lier üôÑ Well good news get flag back think peoples general feelings kids thos disease bit misguided. 

We know contracting later complications already unheard see bad illness childhood lead fatal severe illness later life. Meanwhile, Round Rock ISD (North Austin) sent notice public school teachers telling unless immunocompromised, required come work August. Otherwise fired  pros call power cycle...sounds much elaborate. top five states new deaths Florida, California, Arizona, Texas New Jersey. (Georgia almost #6).

Yeah that's...that's pretty much said... yet meet confirmed republican taking seriously Make America Infected Again! Never use community showers without sandals.. Also powerful... John Hopkins considered reliable source numbers. Worldometer bit weird methodology. hampered states following CDC reporting guidelines cases, deliberately, keep numbers lower.

(For example fmany states refuse report suspected coronavirus deaths, matter obvious was. could die lungs full fluid living fortnight room someone corona Florida officially that's coronavirus death test died). New York 0.1% global population. 5.6% global deaths corona. needs investigations. anything, seems like Summer made infectious. even teachers. administration staff, cafeteria staff janitors would high risk. used janitor. would want clean school full kids pandemic. even worse kids likely blame whoever first least think first. punning ""deer fucking"", mate. OANN That‚Äôs great thing girlfriends, don‚Äôt like current one don‚Äôt keep her. looks like mask white house seal it. kinda state/government seal. wonder plain old cotten mask. doubt president would get anything less N95. wonder wrap em keep public seeing. Dr. Oz said YouTube it‚Äôs flu fuck libtards, let‚Äôs party. /r/COVID19positive might helpful :) Ugh like $5k Disney essential service like grocery stores! also welcome essentials like WWE NBA open arms beautiful state. 

- Florida now... he‚Äôs trying open border.

Nope, stays closed shit figured out. us sitting home unemployed bored, us water park. allowed ignorance problem. slight clarification - 1% population OFFICIALLY virus. real percentage estimated higher (including people virus whatever reason get tested). Based real mortality rate (c. 0.65%). everybody get infected approx 2-3 million would die (assuming virus drastically mutate discover new treatments).  want tell died? also it, lucky?

Lucky strong word it. death rate seems follow pattern killing people relatively low life expectancies. 

Look live world viruses, sometimes viruses kill people. always sad people die. I'm stoked world, designed way charge, that's world live in. reorganize society way pretend live aa world viruses silly. coronavirus isn‚Äôt deadly humorously high death rate.

It high death rate? sure? killed .03% us population. think reasonable .03% population might die natural causes 6 month period? know fact know everyone it. Every day confirmed cases testing. can't accurately tell percent people infects kills bc many people recorded. care hundred thousand plus died.

It's always sad people die live country 350,000,000 people huge blow society reduced 349,900,000. People die. sucks, never fun, always sad, happens. percent population die every year? According you? can't 0. moment society needs average 2.2 babies per household maintain population. 

But seem suggesting, masks social distancing policies seem suggest, WAY 'BEAT' VIRUS MAKE SURE PEOPLE POSSIBLE COME CONTACT IT. inane. viruses work. make argument flattening curve rational think we're past now. 

What happens kid gets chicken pox? way society 'beat' virus making least 51% population immune it. kill virus. 

But goal make sure people possible get it, treat like cattle, tell lock develop artificial immunity (ie vaccine) virus decides disappear. want treated like cattle feel safe, welcome it, give out. let consent. 

I'm okay living world viruses. I'm okay fact make decisions often wash hands always inherent risk coming contact microorganisms. I'm sorry hear due respect that's problem. 

I really hate religion, right? feel unsafe presence religious people, I'm offended see display scene murder jewelry worship it. people books tell proven willing kill apostates unbelievers. get control behavior, tell can't feel unsafe. problem hate ideologies, I've right tell do. 

The goal preventing infection stupid, principle wrong, results catastrophic. My.heslth responsibility, treat epidemic way treated swine flu AIDS epidemic. Make sure keep healthy tell anyone fair question. Covid virus cannot infect mucus membrane, need specific receptor bind enter one cells. imagine cells lots tiny houses little doors locks them, Covid virus one key: protein spike unlock ACE2 receptor, none other. find ACE2 receptor, enter cell, hijack it, start multiplying, take body. ACE2 receptors located cells inside mouth nose, lot located airways. touch mouth virus get in, stays oral chamber maybe bind one receptors eat food, chances pretty good food bolus would envelop virus particle never touch mucus membrane all, gets washed saliva, unlikely linger mouth long enough find ACE2 receptor bind to. 

The warning surfaces little date, scientists believe vast majority infections happen inhale virus droplets directly airway, i.e. talking someone wearing mask. abundance ACE2 receptors means lungs easy targets virus. found confirmed cases people got infected touching surface face, though possible cases. general, food safer touching, inhalation far riskier both. Hahahah... maybe also counting cows sheep. :p No, Lysogenic seen animal viruses well. Retrovirus RNA virus converts RNA cDNA (examples HIV lymphoma viruses). Herpes Virus family inserts DNA neuronal cells (that's get flairups future) making Lysogenic.  campaign selling MAGA masks.

Strange, hearing lectures BLM protests riots broke out. I'm pretty sure EC failed duty 2016. proud 32k people lost? exactly say New York government great job. think anyone 60 considered ""elderly"".

How 60 considered elderly? also lose senior discounts? Yeah hear 30 yr old died? apparently told Dr thought made big mistake. Well, duh wish true Seriously agree go anywhere next two weeks. can‚Äôt fire everybody... Opening schools death sentence parents. Rapid tests horribly inaccurate. PCR tests accurate, take lot longer. Even discounting time takes collect sample drop lab, PCR machine takes hour prep batch 90 samples, 4 hours run tests. labs multiple machines multiple techs people accession receiving working tandem, ultimate limitation many PCR machines (and soon, it'll also many reagents have, we're rapidly burning supplies built things calmed down.)

TL;DR: need test locations machines process tests, period. Someone give kind silver lining here: like, tell 40% deaths fat cartel capos something. old dude pulled gun today kid frozen yogurt place trying enforce mask policy.  fact blame everybody enough money rent, everybody lives tiny Midwestern town, able pick move one money middle pandemic. jobs towns even could move there. absolute lack empathy renters. feel sorry anyone associated you. rough plan. factored long test study takes long would need pump production up.

There rules developing vaccine.

Edit: elaborate. first two studies showed people developed antibodies injected vaccine. third study 30.000 people show antibodies stop getting sick. take 4-5 months, hence finished earliest December.

If results promising way pre produce vaccine ready ASAP. Florida isn‚Äôt destination travel hub? thanks letting know  Film.

Simply true. Please provide infected people travel around world closing air-travel china

Meanwhile, US still letting people fly around world 3 million infected. China authority stop foreign nationals leaving country. accuse China kidnapping help us countries

Wrong, China accepted PPEs many countires, Even allowing visits didnt provide medical care blacks,

I live pretty small town Wisconsin, bars virtually cases popping up. county health commission posting positive cases visited. mind numbing every one bar, bar serves food. even people went symptoms. 

I watched IRL streamer California going bars, bars using loopholes open. made people order order food like every two people. Apparently classified bar anymore, streamer friends acting like regular bar inside, four hours. Masks off, loud close conversation, touching faces, etc. clusterfuck point. also funding. Teachers literally get made fun little make, going attract best brightest way. told single anecdote, really enough info go average experience 325 million Americans. (The particular town live could corrupt af, instance. across board see teacher salaries public education US pitifully low.)  virus, gorillas, freeze death.  way testing everyone makes sense going test everyone daily. Otherwise bunch data points representing snapshot various points time can't take action on. completely, could made bank instead politicized wearing mask he's fucking moron.

Also food swallowed thus exposed stomach acids, breathed in. people take proving point way, way, way far What? Trump make many comments nothing would go away. See long list examples provided above. What‚Äôs difference? even plugged in? Brits Swedes pushing that. least UK believe changed course Boris caught himself. I‚Äôm sure yolo reason wear mask haha DAMN TIME! Let's get mask mandate across country, shit getting control. going sniff covid testing supplies there? Well tell one Chicago  General Kenobi No, ninja masks work better. fact wear hide identity well PPE. ~300/million US. 

We also number 1 total deaths Corona.. hooray... Either or: ""If wear mask, get infected poors"" bet that. fires anyone contradicts slightest, point remain parrots entourage. are, underreported case load estimated 30 800% (let's midpoint 500%), pneumonia deaths 300% YoY.

So ratio 1:1, yes spread quickly thought (how quickly matter great debate), yes people probably died thought (ibid), likely spread undetected killed undetected.

It's still super serious, silent mass murderer makes sense. senator needs get ousted.

Medical scientific researchers Already shown cases children get transmit CoV.

It's like OLDer generations deniers ('Muh rights/freedum!') insist everything CoV hoax.

Maybe get deniers together CoV parties see real not.  they? thought Hong Kong protests game new laws enforced. people belong prison damage chaos causing. assure government step deal people want that.  says people wearing masks stops saying things like ‚Äúmasks double edged sword‚Äù Comment deleted user Let's try mandating masking up

We missed window mask March CDC Surgeon General still lying us.

There excuses. Mask everyone outside home see much helps.

We still fumbling bumbling way figuring mandatory. Trump wore mask today unknown reason - maybe resigning disgrace. Heh even blind squirrel finds nut every then. ......but *Maybe?.....* YOLUD

You live dead well said. I'm definitely reporting shady reckless neighbors this. hate say this, mother NEVER wears mask. want to, take thing seriously. article becoming less deadly abd youth getting people clung that. ""You'll look like poor wear mask. Everyone say, 'can't afford mask'..."" ""And told stop testing""- guy leads whole operation Later on, figured restaurant Wuhan patrons caught front horizontally blowing AC unit.

The diagram something like:

   B C &lt;-- [  ] (AC Unit blowing nice cool COVID swim lanes)
  E F G H ---------------------

Table B infected person. Almost everyone table caught it, someone table C close person table B still caught it, even though unit blowing air opposite way.

No patrons tables restaurant staff caught it, however. Let‚Äôs forget siblings different schools/daycares get go home, mix more, go back prospective schools! California course is.  Truthfulness goes tRump like oil goes water. honestly think china this, accident (wetmarket). add up. think north Korea, Russia, iran, one culprit. really accident. explanation given think natural jump animal seems logical. think focus we're gonna deal this. We'll plenty time blame later, unless leader's get us killed. No. held responsible continuation awful system. one give shit slaver ancestors 300 years ago. exercising soverign right citizen give tacit agreement current system. complain EC like slaves complain masters; way say almost feel like something power over, true slave indeed fact citizen democratic republic. sounds interesting. source? wonder asymptomatic people don‚Äôt develop antibodies virus can‚Äôt meaningfully interact cells. damaged cells means minimal immune response means antibodies, right? Anti-vaxxers reporting in! /s also even 5% Spain it, we've shown 25% covid well. currently live 13¬∞ latitude longer NYC.... 6 Januarys enough send safer, comfortable place. Depends, anti vaxer, flat earther, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take freedom away telling put mask on‚Äù trump voter?

If answer question would accept wear mask, I‚Äôd happy help unfortunately,I don‚Äôt get choose lol ‚ÄúDr. Fauci good bedside manner public wrong everything ever interacted on,‚Äù Navarro said. ‚ÄúNow Fauci saying falling mortality rate doesn‚Äôt matter single important statistic help guide pace economic reopening. ask listen Dr. Fauci‚Äôs advice, answer caution.‚Äù

Hmm, would trust economist (Note: I'm actually economist, guess interpret statistical model best them, T-cells? Antibodies? Fauci knows 100 economists combined behavior infectious diseases) career scientist hundreds hundreds paper infectious diseases authored co-authored? Besides Navarro economist conversant using lagged data deaths extremely lagged.

Right appears sidelined experienced voice listening Navarro economist, Jared whose sole qualification married Ivanka, Birx given semblance scientific objectivity, Giroir seems like decent military guy head. real president would established scientific task force elite infectious disease doctors (like Fauci) epidemiologists put charge, bunch family members political hacks. understand that, really think state like Texas see 1700% increase deaths next 4-6 months? That‚Äôs kind stuff would happen ‚Äòcatch up‚Äô deaths per capita NY. Add 60% humidity 100+ temperature.

The one thing give Disney extensive mosquito elimination program works. Yo lifeguard looking cool hell. Petition build wall around florida SEE OFTEN. Like wtf. shutting state borders probably unconstitutional.

Frankly speaking fuck constitution, fuck President, fuck all. Northeastern independence solution. ""merry christmas ye fookin coont"" -god Let's hope never learn well described world war. would huge worked smart countries arent taking us Covid mutates, U.S. responsible new strain. think I've finally found something worth getting arrested for, Floridawoman style. wouldn‚Äôt pay dime online education. consider lowering tuition salaries. Online instruction little value. Even deaths stay 700 day, unrealistic, US double total deaths quarter million dead end year. Breaking news: dumb people act dumb #HOLD UP. 

Digging bodies helps how? Sounds like way spread disease.


What cremating NEWLY dead hurridly? ass backwards expend labor digging folks up. also highly disre-fucking-spectful. UGH! ü§ê friend‚Äôs coworker tested positive symptoms. got tested go back work shutdown, would idea it. Trash get another one. ""Boss, gentleman tested negative second test positive first one. do? Third one?""

""No, things expensive Dave. flip coin something."" I‚Äôm Republican I‚Äôve taking seriously. 

Governor Hogan Governor DeWine taken seriously.

I admit loud embarrassing segment party not. hate them. They‚Äôre back lurking r/conservative recuperate looney echo chamber. You‚Äôre right... reading this, boy really want frozen yogurt. 

Everything else aside, nothing surprises anymore. Trump compromised Deep State years look distribution. suspect one *very* long tail (as actual time till recovery vary significantly person person, may take long time good portion people recover).

Anecdotally, know three people got it. One person died. ""back normal"" (but 50 pounds lighter) less week. third person got March still recovering. Deaths 1000 guys overreacting. /s true. I‚Äôm trying take every precaution. Thank you. hope too. Wondering difficult expensive would modify air conditioning systems - example, restaurants bars - duct outdoor air (instead recirculating indoor air) HEPA filters would either result pulmonary embolism stroke. .1% what? cases, deaths? think far ahead American culture fed stuff like ""live now"" , ""instant gratification"" , ""can't live fear"", ""rather die feet, live knees"", overexaggeration orwellian nightmare. 


And fair truth depending situation context. law life rule live by. However, lot Americans view get Mexico build wall. goal prevent deaths dont open schools. Correct, main issue isn‚Äôt ethical way getting herd immunity hospitals capacity death rate likely skyrocket result, creating many needless deaths.  story really helpful personally better understand reasonable risks were. Many experts interviewed high risk high value, trust taking things seriously. Even Dr. Fauci okay socializing friends outside patio safe distance. 

Basically- never careful, perhaps extreme end cautious could safely introduce small amount socialization without taking much risk.

All said, answer question joy continuing piano lessons practice remotely. started lessons person last summer adult since March moved sessions video call. Surprisingly, video/remote lessons worked great I've made lots progress time practice!

I hope find ways get this! Thanks part. TECHNICALLY didn't. Canadian rules strongly discourage implement punishments for. one blocking anyone border provinces.

Cuomo saying also can't stop people say border Constitution. implement 2 week self isolation come in.

It might seem like big difference we're talking legal semantics, y'know is. study replying says wrong. Trump care. expendable long stays power. Oh look, pardoned traitor. Oh look, betrayed us Russia (again). Coronavirus? problem, plebes. Probably higher US countries people scared go doctor get financially disemboweled. Netherlands terrace popular area. Everything spaced 1.5 metres apart plastic barriers key places. Aside that, outside terraces, pretty much normal again. mask tram ride home it. imagine going many months crisis and, everywhere else world returning normal, situation worse started. take years. also counting people asymptomatic never got tested USA 2? bigger issue delay Texas. Two days ago reported death May 24 th there's lag. sure reason one, morgue trucks already place expecting lot.

You're right though, math order magnitude. Hopefully texas see 1500 death days period theory well, told mask stay out, care are. Brother lives there. talked minutes ago like, ""Hey, wearing masks there?"" Nope - work, grocery stores, anywhere. ""believe"" them. hell lot better off. Imagine Democrats put aside hatred president minute put earnest attempt work him. Pelosi crew hadn‚Äôt encouraging travel early Trump restricted flights

He waited whole month restrict flights China, hardly Democrats Fauci hadn‚Äôt lied masks early on. Imagine China front world dangerous new virus was. Imagine states followed guidelines declining cases opening. There‚Äôs million what-ifs could put us better position went differently didn‚Äôt. biggest issue now, people still politicizing *cough cough* masks, it‚Äôs going kill people make things lot worse. 

None excuses administration ignoring problem Italy countries getting swamped. mention tweets urging protestors ""liberate"" states lockdowns. Truth is, folks still taken issue seriously largely blame anti-mask hysteria led pandemic lasting longer pandemic opened eyes anything it‚Äôs faith people able put aside petty bullshit real crisis hits completely eroded. 

That requires competent leader capable bringing people together, trait know president gets lion‚Äôs share blame. Make mistake anything I‚Äôve said above, dude narcissistic asshole actively ignoring evidence would make look bad blood hands far I‚Äôm concerned. doesn‚Äôt excuse people bullshit. still people running around acting like masks issue constitution freedom.

You 265 posts former subreddit, *know* would still support him. Great point. Still scary AF. took wife last year Orlando (Universal) late July 10th anniversary. bad honestly (and I'm Canadian) hindsight gotten married September. fair, think people realize they're signaling molecules versus magic serum. Ya, Ontario seem knocking door going double digit daily cases steady downward trend 

We want fucked know distribution is. Many people reddit complain they've suffering months. anomalies, 2-3 standard deviations mean like 5-8 weeks 3 weeks? Florida joined us. couple states could unfortunately  Yeah think people miss huge sub-group baby boomers super liberal. mom one. siblings? much. Can‚Äôt hurt careful. Electrolytes vitamins potassium! Can‚Äôt forget one! hope start feeling better. don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre looking cells ‚Äî antibodies leave USA, like even live country like 50% population science facts? lmao can't say I'm surprised people stupid, amount people definitely unsettling. niece tested positive well couple friends. One teenagers previously exposed didn‚Äôt tell anyone. 
 lives parents nobody else got it. worst performing states controlled democrats - ""left wing"", I'm sure point is, since that's also mask wearing tribe. mask wearing tribe performed worst (no fault masks). Point is, argument flies face statistics.

You want admit made issue political, 1/2 fault people like understand importance mask wearing royal assholes people don't. Turns talk insult people listen countries well followed guidelines.

Maybe, countries followed guidelines well. multi-factor problem simplifying push politics. Rumor went hospital get tests done. Thats closed press.



Edit: reason people seem think test could get done coronavirus test, means ct scan, MRI, pet, etc. Oh you‚Äôre right, context makes sense. That‚Äôs terrible symptomatic didn‚Äôt let daycare know :( Didn‚Äôt establish early like 3% worst-case scenario? think may seeing worst-case scenario. what‚Äôs more, I‚Äôm even surprised.  Soft reset didn‚Äôt work. Need stick paper clip tiny hole. every country earth could done nothing 8 days earlier? Also Well that's unfortunate, budgeting barely complicated equation wrote, loan/interest calculation complex. People practicing least much. Yuuup always counter-measure. gotta plan 5 steps ahead. impossible status everything (or size /representation) .

OK, impossible wrong mindset, 'exasperating' lol  might make feel better think stupid/slow people disagree politics, VAST majority anti-mask, anti-social distancing idiots actually otherwise intelligent reasonably well educated.

The study replying says opposite. got beaten telling obey rules (including buying tickets). guys (Americans) making masks ""just"" fuckers want obey rules. Kids matter political bargaining chips people advocating opening schools. However South Korea willing accept temporary measures infringe personal rights privacies sake country. US, measures would (and have) result outcries MUH PHREEDUMZ MUH PRIVACEEZ endless quoting Benjamin Franklin line.

That said, South Korea (mostly) life going (mostly) normal - enjoying freedom US full panic mode complaining muh phreedumz Yeah, make sense. Dig old bodies put new ones in...so going old ones? Move somewhere else cremate them?

Why recently deceased instead save extra step disrespectfully digging old remains? good luck developing effective vaccine really case. called ""a closed channel"". going hear want. true narcissist thinks know everything surround ""yes men/women"" there's objection. Ban Floridians Texans. tend pieces garbage anyhoo  137,392 deaths.... Could false positive could recovered (thus testing negative) hadn‚Äôt yet fully ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù  marry? heard Alain de Botton. interesting ideas constitutes good marriage fuck up. Woooo numba 1! FUCKING TIME, TOOK 7 MONTHS cure flu. cure covid-19. won‚Äôt. know took case, two negative tests negative antibody test usual ""proof"". statistically unlikely first place. overestimate well Covid spreads households. Also, wearing mask went living people also wear public?

In places mask compliance, scenario extremely unlikely, point even worth worrying about. need look rate spread countries contact tracing show scenario little paranoia. fucking hard? all. far kids surviving know yet long term effects virus. Also parents often ignore warnings cautious around kid end admitted themselves.  Eventually every incompetent leader forced right thing fucking time! Stupid question but, videos madness hospitals America? months ago werent nearly many cases, videos trucks full bodies, hallways hospitals full covid patients, mass graves NYC, etcetcetc.

&amp;#x200B;

Now twice bad there's videos found anywhere? going on? Shouldnt internet flooded kind videos? sure would helpful proof people dont believe real not. mean, half people don‚Äôt wear masks, needed mandated mask order, heavy penalties reopening following social distancing guidelines secret shoppers enforcing mean? There's currently average [over confirmed deaths per day US, number rapidly growing following exponential growth daily confirmed cases past month (7 day average grew 65 one day, 722 deaths far today vs 265 deaths last Saturday). Based current growth, hit 1000 deaths day one week. don‚Äôt get either, see plenty dumbasses enjoy little plague paradise.

They‚Äôll returning infections images. hitting paywall :( we're headed 350k dead miracle stop virus today

So gonna million dead end year. Last Saturday slightly misleading since 4th July weekend overall trend still clearly up. [Masks may protect wearer coronavirus originally thought, new research I've already told boyfriend even want go theaters time year bad things getting. 

I really hope get stupid people power soon. least need people office wear masks public. already know spreads quickly. fact number infected **might be** lot higher know **good news.** Vote fucks out. Anyone said COVID hoax refused wear mask barred getting meds. FL governor many state officials STILL Denying CoV effects spread.

They booted office put trial incompetence! Lone ranger gained quite bit weight Even COVID fiasco America 100% elect Trump again, majority Americans either selfish, stupid both.

I lived Australia awhile kick every day pursuing sponsorship extend visa.  articles gloves purpose keep contamination room contamination. even doctors wear gloves often touch glasses mask face. 

Washing hands often, using antibac suffice. Although admit I'm using gloves gas pump. Thanks this. think part what‚Äôs confused mouth connected nasal lung passages, air might inhaled mouth (meaning particles mouth might transfer). think part point even virus particle food isn‚Äôt likely *inhaled* like particles air. agree reading surface transfer risk lower originally communicated. would reasonable say touching surfaces touching mouth pretty low risk?

Anyone going Florida mind right Disney parks get pretty hot summer? solutions involve putting children position cause deaths family members. hope talking protesters. Wish could upvote more. need try harder everything heard everywhere else shithole. really Yeah seem counter intuitive.. grocery stores similar places seem like would breeding grounds.   There‚Äôs person wwe least twice. fucking disgusting many people still vote asshole November. know, one judge future gone person graduation 2020. date going walk disgust. employer turn down. kids feel shame. they're making close minimum wage, extra unemployment end month. They're getting money it.

That's terrible minimum wage is.   think mean, wearing mask reduces risk 65% prevents droplets flying around. yeah he's smart man, entirely transactional, moral compass, dont expect super villain plans counter plans. rate long-term disability. 

A lot people dismissing because, hey, vast majority people survive it. everyone survives goes right back normal. infections, best infections. talk lot people tell most! couldn‚Äôt agree Dr. Fauci make huge mistake lying masks beginning. Even seeming good reason.

Very regrettable. sad headline 5 months virus started Health wealth Yeah. bunch people left went closed states hang came back. Pffft Well, sloppy second woman, ya???

I commented own, every store, business residence go normally. summer, AC on.

You walk business say 77F day, AC on. happen. people know nobody who's tough case. see often enough even sub - ""I know four people even bad cold.""

B-b-but school district's administrators said children can't catch human disease! TIL children humans too! (/S) misleading. Cuyahoga county. mean, good them, hoping Uncle DeWine maning up.

I'm going places legally open compliance state rules live place strict regulations around reopening. go show morally superior hiding fear forever. Almost one know live cares. verbally attacked saying thankful local schools going require staff students wear masks.

People testing positive continue go around parks stores without masks precautions think it‚Äôs hoax. virus done good job pointing many idiots truly among us Spanish flu. Went away years. part problem might internal too.

Not ""might be"", is. know people live NJ traveling state fun games COVID layoff vacations. know people states going Jersey shore same. I'm taking gives point lol thinking IKEA Saturday no, Disney July worse. still talking 4 million deaths aim herd immunity solution.

Yeah, ugly doubt. probably higher since think immunity lasts 1 - 3 years. could imagine little waves outbreaks every year killing people time. 

I hope early vaccines work well. wipe like Smallpox world return ‚Äúold normal‚Äù next pandemic, may 20 years now. getting better better making cures then.

On bright side though, Trump followers believe hardly deaths suppose it‚Äôs good news even though it‚Äôs ripping like wildfire, it‚Äôs non deadly strain, awesome. JOKE Huh? always assumed guys smart. back to

 exactly info asked for, appreciate gathering together. Stay safe healthy. I've noticed Yeehaw states straight refuse wear masks. me, NY east coast masks plenty. people need take seriously Northeast corridor success. waited feds (always mistake regardless admin) got fucked local elected officials instead guy already hated lol. absolutely fucking bonkers still know many people said ‚Äúeh Hillary‚Äôs bad.‚Äù White House criticizing scientist *checks notes* changing opinion information available...? 

I don‚Äôt understand administration. Dr. Fauci isn‚Äôt medical god, he‚Äôs human passionately devoted entire life medicine. He‚Äôs going make mistakes.

 managed find alcohol hand sanitizer weeks ago. Stocked up. steal Oxford vaccine helps speed trials. Would probably impact anything else do. Right he's screaming wind. People talk need adults room, count much adults ignored toddlers running show.  Yes, believe so. Someone posted article protests this. Praying useless Fuck people wear masks. fuck federal government lackluster response since start pandemic. woman die. seems like Nurgle thing. don't.

Most people comply mandates. fact data.

And compliance increases community traumatized contagious deadly virus. data that, too.

We also showing people support social distancing, lockdowns, masks. 

It requires faith look data. seems well though, (terrible us) I'm doubting ever mutate less dangerous.. Given us intelligence seemed tried warn Trump january gave serious warnings first weeks february contain almost late nobody reacted, dont think much blame, operate chinese numbers, frankly reluctant declare pandemic given huge implications move has.

But US alone blame, countries reacted fast enough, UK even nit properly react rest Europe literally ""burning"" UK would different continent.

But totally new situation, pandemic since 1918, people forget lessons learned past next generation gets steering wheels. Agreed. tried find source information well started using ammunition people saying big deal.

I can't find anything. hundredth time, shaped like common flat washer! Losing kids would worse dying. 1 3 American kids either overweight obese making susceptible serious symptoms agree. vaccine isn‚Äôt coming next year, figure social activities way normalize wearing masks distancing best can. What‚Äôs saying? enemy good perfect. perfect. There‚Äôs risk everywhere. Making seem like indoors outdoors mask without social distancing bad mask means many want give bother it. mean, already know exactly they‚Äôre going find there: nothing.

I saw another article made clear goal quell conspiracy theories. They‚Äôre going quell conspiracy theories making fucking obvious plan quell conspiracy theories. 

Basically, ‚Äúwe going prove didn‚Äôt come lab/wasn‚Äôt engineered.‚Äù yeah, know expect find PLAN find. way science. think someone tell Florida competition. Deaths across board treatment changed.

/r/Coronavirus/comments/hpupus/comment/fxugkxl?context=1 WH right like fucking conspiracy theorists denying 911 Sandy Hook, disgusting know face kids sleep night. us flight attendants. Sigh. /r/news ban coronavirus articles?

Curious rarely article there, think coronavirus thing US news subreddits. Gotcha, appreciate it. see mention time stamps Jolene can‚Äôt actually find time stamps. *must* missing something. Florida #1 üòé 7 day rolling average arid-Rona 3,400 today‚Äôs reporting. guy thinks virus dosnt replicate children words thinks wants fuck adults  thought virus stay alive surface couple days good normal.  wonder could predicted would happen they‚Äôve opened beaches way soon everyone partying there? 

Who could imagined? Shocked!!! one science deniers fuck, doubt would ever that. much agree that... probably won‚Äôt. [Wonder dude Trump retweeted **Why experts consider fast food/takeout safe coronavirus, say contracted touching mouth touching contaminated surface? Whats difference?** SARS fizzled out, Ebola close one general people became complacent many diseases got killed decades vaccines. anti vaccine movement supported silent crowd stopped taking vaccines vaccinating children bother, measles long gone anyway etc. conservative friend thinks great, thinks herd immunity reached sooner insane. It‚Äôs 24-48 hours live, tested often want. happened, you‚Äôd think USA would come top pandemic. Crazy fast world changes... heard kinda like snow globe, floating space.

Sounds legit. believe Gorbachev said Chernobyl one biggest reasons fall Soviet Union Total daily cases today India 28k, testing 280k. 10% positive rate. still see lot rhetoric India's testing lacking. Frankly, know think. China, India, Germany *United States* already using group testing. people support lockdowns comply masks.

So people require bleeding support common sense measures. Nah it‚Äôs over. Obviously totally reasonable position. doesn‚Äôt seem anywhere near majority feel outside Reddit. even 'scientific' term? far know, standard test kit distinguishing whether patient asymtomatic mildly symptomatic.

And studies showing even 'asymtomatic' patients may underlying lung damage. 'asymptomatic' may mean patients aware symptoms, quite subjective cognitive notion. Yeah we‚Äôre going win tooüòÇ That's go back excess status, especially write one cause death, sympathize anyone saying writing COVID little bullshit - person might actually terminal cancer.

All thise becomes irrelevant say US x% population die cancer sigma 0.0y% every year, year difference z%, 18 sigmas away baseline.

Statistics discipline that's actually pretty rugged. give pretty comfortable numbers deaths, though we'll deal people said response COVID killed (despite course examples elsewhere far harder lockdowns create excess deaths). Lol, hope realize isn‚Äôt good method argumentation.  Arizona huge amount retirees, aka old people

Median age AZ 38
Median age US 38.2

Another point actually socially distancing. forced wear masks actually social distancing. Restaurants open, tables 1,5 meter apart, limitations per many people inside etc. stand line stand 1,5m apart.

With many current cases slowly reopening, piecie piece. mask nothing. masks really. Decreases 33%, increases 50% Asymptomatic comprising anywhere 17-30% infected doesn‚Äôt strike relatively rare. tribute, though.... He's super germaphobic. loves bubble Hold up, name Tex? Thank you! dock SKY HARBOR yup...Texas well skewing numbers earlier on. good news deaths declining, sure turn bad news. SECRET=ZERO TESTS   /s watch vietnam american

Someone somewhere looked me.

I dont believe god, luck escaping america, im starting believe...... Yeah. It's... really problematic super unethical. 

The article written persuasively argument really was, ""My patient got reinfected pretend like immune once.""

And think could written responsibly. Though mild cases even asymptomatic cases seem suffer long-term effects much hospitalized (but intubated) patients. Intubated patients course whole story. Trump finally decided wear mask republicans praising him. like little kid praise learning tie shoes own. That's braindead 'leaders"" republicans always elect Nope, tv money, literally nothing else. zero need open NBA middle covid worldwide-hotspot. Americans refusing swallow news disregarding progress made places, making bullshit claims american exceptionalism instead admitting problems. read comments can't believe see seems like obvious solution. coordinated nation wide six week stay-at-home order. Freeze rent, freeze utility deadlines never charge period ""lockdown"". Also make sure every household enough money stock whatever food/necessities need. would suck would hard impossible i'm sure one would regret stopped spread virus. open schools, open stores whatever come on, take care problem first. Radical problems require radical solutions. Staff bring Mickey Mouse costume work sanitize nightly washing hot wash leaving dry. sharing costumes, kids! 

Or alternatively wear disposable one. taking 7 day average 2 weeks ago, hope figure dumb.

Nothing crazy, definitely something see :) Unfortunately always considered bad way back WW2, even WW2 Americans exactly loved everywhere went (usually ""thank you...Can leave now?). next. lowers immune system

This literally lie.

[Generally testosterone immunosuppressive effect estrogen immunoenhancing effect immune system. Estrogen shown regulate immune response impairing negative selection high affinity auto-reactive B cells, modulating B cell function leading Th2 response (21, 22). Estrogen influences physiological functions via ERs expressed brain, gut epithelial cells, lymphoid tissue cells well immune cells (23, 24).

As cardiovascular issues, [the study failed account cardiovascular health factors, smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity rates, physical activity, etc...

They failed compare like trans women like cis women, like trans men like cis men. findings could easily imply ""trans individuals likely exhibit poor cardiovascular health practices like smoking excessive alcohol consumption"", rather than, ""MtF hormones make likely suffer cardiovascular issues"". former interpretation would surprising, given trans people often turn alcohol, food, etc... deal additional stresses trans brings first place.

Now, say transgender hormone therapy cannot effect cardiovascular health. rather common knowledge steroidal hormone treatment, reason, impact heart. known birth control, post-menopausal hormone treatment, etc..., nothing new. trans women currently stopping HRT COVID-19 pandemic, every cis woman birth control post-menopausal hormone therapy. Doctors factor risks deciding prescribe medication, overwhelmingly, benefits seen outweigh risks.

This medicine works. medication zero side effects, doctors always making judgements whether particular treatment modality harm good. cases, hormone therapy worth small increase cardiovascular health.

Sort like venomous snake distinctive markings another species snake imitates lacks venom. 

Take coral snake, example. species mimic red-and-black color scheme order make predators avoid them. fact, mimics outnumber actual coral snakes. Coral snake encounters are, context, ""rare,"" relatively speaking.

You're still moron go pet coral snake mimic wild, since I'm assuming snake expert. (Maybe worst possible analogy.)

In case, take category ""snakes red black"" rather category ""coral snakes"" deciding danger noodles scary, determining something venomous mimic fly either really difficult impossible people.

So reasonable classify people ""has symptoms"" ""doesn't symptoms,"" since easily observable traits. ""Presymptomatic"" vs. ""asymptomatic"" not. correcting false information ‚Äúdickish,‚Äù proudly dick.

In Europe, basically any. I'm sure there's single decent-sized European metro area straddles border 2 countries. Even minor metros straddle countries (like Basel), there's nearly many people moving border US. Moving across borders still kind pain.

Well gonna sound outlandish bc americans completely cucked, lot places government things majority citizens agree with, respond striking, blocking infrastructure, generally making society grind halt resolution. Meanwhile we're calling governor retarded internet throwing hands air like we've done demonstrates clearly give fuck.

I would pull trash barrel long hilly dirt road grandmother. I'd exhausted feet. less energy *she* age 80.

It felt like bad dream. attempted describe generally caring family, dismissed ""all [my] head."" weird. could hikes. Bike rides would last block. 26 years old otherwise great health.

Then one day finally made connection bread sandwich giving lifelong chronic heartburn. threw sandwich away switched tacos. 

My energy came back within 2 weeks I've never lost it. Attempted multiple times eat wheat always causes instant horrible heartburn.

The point this?

If Coronavirus cause lasting fatigue, *do want* virus. pants want thier planet back everything stay safe. They‚Äôll shutting soon, becomes agonizingly obvious murdering thousands. dude, same. blame him? need keep people deserve honest intellectual life one, make sure people like remain accustomed prevaricating. make easy. billionaire bet I‚Äôd lot optimistic too. nobody held Italy accountable? Like A-holes knew spreading virus countries shut down. Italy directly responsible NY situation also brain problem seems appear even mild cases. remember correctly something like 1 3 patients experience those. asthma too, wearing mask doesnt make things worse. excuse really bad. can't imagine getting mad ignorant.

I thought ignorance bliss. sad. don‚Äôt care now, it‚Äôs health emergency, wear mask  know think clever pointing out. fits narrative explanation wrong nuanced takes time. 

If rapid rise cases, lower death rate deaths lag new cases. Also, CFR inflated early pandemic couldn‚Äôt find positive cases, testing death rate going down.

The facts virus kills 0.50%-1.00% catch it, 3% hospitalized, significant amount people long term health effects yet quantified. took trump literally said heat kill it, opened risk hope (not guided specific science) would seasonal like flu.

It wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm trying get family leave Florida next months. would get fuck there. took mean room something like hotel know hotels converted coronavirus care centers mild/moderate cases India. Attendant seems mean care sitter, someone hired stay someone able care themselves. often Healthcare work backgrounds.   Japan well, poster child ""masks need foolish Americans!"" seem slipping controlling this.

Can anyone offer insight why? Japanese folk pretty notoriously compliant laws, also already culture normalized mask use reduce spread disease. too!!  Ughhhh :( Oof, that's 26k / day -- average. think election year also driving terrible decisions Litterally everything &amp; anything conspiracy you‚Äôre deranged enough.  that‚Äôs perceive it. However according countries, ok start schools APs? Becuase Florida reporting COVID deaths pneumonia Aren‚Äôt still studies immunity? read get antibodies don‚Äôt last forever. Yes, american liberals live fantasyland evil world invented Trump GOP. US corporate plutocracy decades now. parties subservient billionaires. briefly hospitalized ""mild"" case. Still breathing issues four months later.

I would highly suggest overestimating disease rather underestimating it. Flying coronavirus looks much like view living room couch. Oh, wait that's b/c I'm avoiding air travel like plague. lockdown followed well one even telling people wear masks least officially. entirely put blame stupid mop headed cunt number 10. Mexico undercounting deaths far anywhere US Europe. Excess deaths crisis way 2x reported numbers. 

Mexico already surpassed Italy per capita excess deaths, going go way, way beyond that.

It's - Mexico's situation far worse. OH. MY. GOD. Someone get direct line president! I‚Äôve keeping overflow pantry staples since April ‚Äî overhoarding backup stuff case certain supply chains get dicey. I‚Äôm making spaghetti might buy 2 packages pasta 2 cans tomatoes put duplicates away, etc. Can‚Äôt hurt, it‚Äôs nothing wouldn‚Äôt consume anyway finally ends. mean linear algebra 101. make model using bunch randomly chosen functions also able RMSE &lt;2% past 11 weeks. That's accurately model real system, set spanning R_n definition (over R_n). start trying use weights ""model"" future, things fall apart.

It's there's limitation model epidemiologist, fundamentally think doing. Models built predictive power; curve fitting weird set basis vectors happens work okay.  That's around half Canada's total active covid cases. PER DAY. understand head hospitals start bottom well right?

Or youre insanely ignorant talking ass topic know lightly about.

[Houstons hospital leader confident overcome mean. Houstons still elective surgeries. 

You dont elective surgeries dont icu beds. Assuming R0 1.3 (which optimistic), expecting \~79,000 deaths *in Florida alone* herd immunity sets in. It'll take less year get (it'll one year 15,000 cases/day, that's going go up.) November expect deaths Florida.

If R0 (as sources estimate), multiply numbers 3. hospital system collapses -- almost certainly will, soon -- multiply numbers 10, going happened Italy.

We serious trouble. Everybody that. even skipping phases, like chinese vaccine going applied military without phase 3 closely follow talking points mass media, wonder? Maybe I'll start shopping downtown. sounds awesome. Well good them. Wonder Disney World close again. evident politicized mask debate. People stupid think logically. Jesus h christ, Noah get fucking boat Texas too. Approximately 5500 pnumonia compared 10 year average around 1100. sad. like juggling knives shocked get stabbed.

This pretty much led every revolution history, yet technology culture barred common folk ability revolt wanted to.  old enough able go? that's option. may isolate family return. tough call. far bugs every reason wear mask America political/religious reason. ( saying politics/religion bad, soo scary fall onto beliefs/faith rather whats happening)

Just like Japan handle it. culture, get sick wear mask prevent illnesses spreading colleagues.

In America, reason sign silence what? still dont answer keep asking. It‚Äôs like wearing clothes.

The reason im ranting workplace keep running issue. 
- Social Distancing sign person secure mental issues. 
- Asking someone put mask infringing rights freedom speech PRIVATE PROPERTY 
- cant breath, let us help curb side pick up. infringed rights shop.

It keeps looping back scary selfishness motivated wanting change damn thing behavior plans. shortsightedness + selfish overinflated ego. Phase 1. Putin tells scientists come cure

Phase 2. Scientists tell Putin one

Phase 3. Putin declare cure perfection injection ~~Soviet~~ Russian people commence! 

[Or  people still think world class healthcare?

I know that's TV man told me. online classes? want homeschool you? 


If they're still working, maybe spring tutor?  People saying it‚Äôs perfect plan. best plan. vaccine developers injected themselves? also gone nearly gone. :-/ Restaurants serve alcohol utilized bars, basically. They‚Äôre trying let still serve food normal dinner hours cut drunken bar transmission. think understand cult works.

Even millions die, somebody else's fault. Never Christ Returned's. Like 30% people North Country put mask damn nose. driving nuts. publishing opinion piece pandemic over. Lol, completely faking numbers. Millions migrants came Hotspots like Delhi Mumbai yet 900 death lol enjoyed time out. never felt unsafe.

Damn. almost like testing well. kinda we're using % positive, forgotten already.

% positive due amount testing changes when:

1. Testing requirements changed 
2. supply exceeds demand (downward)

I see reason believe either things happening.  would New Yorkers going Florida July? Especially people starting get tested earlier they'll longer lead time bias wow, looked up. seems rare theres lots treatments available. guess another media spin.

What said irrelevant morbidly obese three comorbidities: lupus, diabetes asthma. normal.  It'd mean USA Brazil approach would better Europe's without vaccine coming  there's fewer deaths reported, looks like president/governor/mayor better job handling actually did. 

If target specifically death toll total infected, it'll look like even lower % dead places, also gives impression handled better places. know Florida lagging testing also reporting deaths. numbers likely much larger. likely see huge spike next 2 6 weeks even Florida closed today.

What happened something needs discussed media. need see people's eyes open fact people numbers, human beings.

I also think that, safe over, AIDS-quilt style memorial died. Even vaccine, we'll still lose people, one vaccine enough. Florida tested 142k. clicking, googled Florida Mask Requirement. Disturbingly, found [this indicates states made masks mandatory general public. 

My country run idiots... He‚Äôs definitely geek, though help eradicate polio created essential lab method virology, practical well. Apparently exactly like merch store.  I've posted before, people said helpful, I'm posting again: 

When people say vaccine rushed normally takes many years develop vaccines, correct forget history. early vaccines like smallpox rabies easy doctor could work months make rudimentary vaccine. Jenner (smallpox) Pauster (rabies) succeeded basically first attempt, despite 18th century knowledge. hard problems left over, like HIV, hard low hanging fruits picked centuries ago. Covid brand new virus, could easy smallpox hard HIV, far looks like got lucky going one easier ones (at least, way easier SARS1, animals suffered massive allergic reactions first vaccine candidate. animal experiment part Covid vaccine went really well.) vaccines talk recent years takes decades research toughest nuts crack, typical disease world.

Modern vaccines created way safety verified first, efficacy second. first batch Covid vaccine candidates already passed safety trials, side effects typical redness injection site arm soreness. I'd feel comfortable receiving first vaccines potential long term complications type vaccine extremely rare (one type influenza vaccine weakly linked type facial nerve problem, one type H1N1 vaccine linked sleep disorders, long term issues heard of). Live vaccine much risky, would hesitant get rushed live vaccine, Covid dangerous one trying make live vaccine it, especially looks like safe options going work. Unfortunately, people referring hold almost levers power government right now. lose shit, tend get...shooty. Italy also done much better job controlling cases US, I'd less reluctant support reopening schools would US, currently reporting 70k cases day, plus whole 1% entire population infected easy fix, increase federal minimum wage every year keep rise inflation.

This way power wont shift companies stay balanced companies people. going change regardless virus. wave that's wash us building many states. locked March/April months low numbers, people, unfortunately, became convinced Democratic ploy nothing flu, even that. time, numbers increasing exponentially day. But, minds hard change entrenched one position. Sadly, things full swing full speed ahead...Into wall? cliff? knows. bizarre thing ever actually believed could occur lifetime. stupid. Even non EU countries closely connected EU agreed ban travelers countries lot coronavirus cases. third countries list, Member States Schengen Associated countries temporarily suspending non-essential travel third countries EU+ area, meaning certain categories travellers could authorised entry. **The ‚ÄúEU+ area‚Äù includes 30 countries: 26 27 EU Member States well four Schengen Associated States: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway Switzerland.** Ireland currently apply travel restriction.

Ireland stands One man claimed believes COVID-19 situation However, others said they'll absolutely following 14-day self-quarantine advice.

And makes sounds like quarantine advice one follow like it. true? enforced supervised? 142k. US military complex dumb toned funds spent useful amenities. said, certain groups Asians America well-liked around world smarter civilised people developed nations. NBA continue reason Disneyworld open; Disney finished doesn‚Äôt.

It relies *heavily* theme parks ESPN make money. basketball down, ESPN. 

And weren‚Äôt safe financial position begin quarantine hit. reported 142k tests today. 142,000.

New York, highest, capacity 20,000

The percent positive *LOWER* TODAY last 2 weeks. Yet every single moron thread give flying fuck actual data. Master's Statistics. You? got married. Permanent citizen. Til death us part. we're talking present. NY hit far hardest, nobody saw coming, due density, NYC international city. realized happening, NY fought hard get today, great place, relatively. Florida *doing* FAR worse NY, even NY worse point past Wrong. bad math combine bad math even worse logic come conclusion big deal.

15,000 0.07% total FL population, 0.0007%. that's many people ""have covid today"" that's many people found positive today. 233,000 people FL covid today (active cases) 1% population state. factor thousand. That's literally least likely possibility many reasons.

Arizona Texas starting real pain suffering seen hospital occupancy death rates increasing exactly following pattern MA, NJ, NY.

FL state seem follow way (so far). Yeah they‚Äôll replace Fauci someone trumps bidding correct. 

But let's change ""never get to"" ""choose to"". hard go holiday. Fuck - cellphones video chat. can‚Äôt even fathom taking long process. PA got mine 2 days. Honest question, country tried help us? must see leadership shit putting teir citizens danger profit. sure anyone outside US could do, UN usually step world leader lets citizens die like this? decided own.  I'd bet half see kids hours week, half know kids safe afford keep someone home shelter place. soon allowed businesses make people go back offices.

Birx Fauci worked together since 80s. wish they'd resign speak openly That's thing though. believe travel air needs happen. Virtually none essential. mean, asymptomatic transmission not, presymptomatic transmission effectively thing evidence supports overwhelming.

Since know asymptomatic cases, less common, exist, practical distinction exists not? Asymptomatic may turn presymptomatic meantime, fighting presymptomatic transmission. Also keeping bars closed indoor restaurants. worry us staying vigilant fall things get colder harder hang outside worry people returning. fly couple weeks ago. high anxiety trip, really can't find fault airports airline handled things. Best avoid possible, thought people running things get credit deserve best job can. DeFuckis still thinks good here. He‚Äôs prime example oxygen thief looks like survey, superintendent later clarified meant planning purposes intended sound like ultimatum, offered four choices:

1. intend request accomodation medically diagnosed health condition puts high risk
2. intend request leave Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA Act)
3. intend request leave Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
4. intend resign position

‚ÄúIf indicate intend report work, representative Benefits HR contact soon assist leave process resignation,‚Äù survey reads. count day get results back dye took test wonder? friend mine Florida posted wanting hang people gets back? Hell nooo .... see parent's viewpoint too. going watch kids parents work? going financially handle one parent quitting job? much realistically think younger kids going learn online classes? kids internet laptops? kids going get extra supports need like speech therapy special education services? parents planning kids everything shuts nice outside? 

I saying open schools. lot people commenting kids experiencing issues Good one üòÇ US soldiers keep up, South Korea Japan might side China kick US military. good news either way Netherlands exact policy months, never done better, done scarcity available tests. testing everyone wants adequate testing regime. testing someone who's already almost dying achieve lot (it gives certainty), show early rise cases (people sick already get extremely sick often).

A lot testing one ways controlling virus future. things include early regional lockdowns, sewage testing, GP reporting, corona app etc. tools toolbox fight virus.

So yes there's point testing acquittance. gives certainty case adds case statistics (making statistics accurate, actually usable). I'm saying testing magic bullet, certainly help fight coronavirus, one easiest methods wield fight COVID-19. sure lot countries test severe cases? Netherlands one worst came testing, even testing everyone wants now. UK, Germany Belgium testing **a lot** now. 

And asking otherwise healthy people get test, people sick potentially coronavirus (but one stopping getting one without symptoms, always lie, almost one wants stick shoved nose nothing) tested. RIVM (Dutch CDC) estimated summer times would 30,000 people tested daily everyone potential COVID-19 symptom gets test (doesn't mean it, prediction using values what's normally happening summer). &lt;10,000 people show every day. 

So trying test everyone shows symptoms, catch virus early immediate contact tracing keep active infections low possible prevent spread, detect potential outbreak early give people certainty symptoms. 

Ugh answer mess, least hope understood trying say haha! ""Once Electoral College decided on, several delegates (Mason, Butler, Morris, Wilson, Madison) openly recognized ability protect election process cabal, corruption, intrigue, faction. delegates, including James Wilson James Madison, preferred popular election executive.[18][19] Madison acknowledged popular vote would ideal, would difficult get consensus proposal given prevalence slavery South:

This difficult. simply requires throwing money problem, we've seen government literally make appear thin air whenever wants.

You shut non-essential business, let everyone work online so, stop large gatherings. put freeze credit card/loan/rent/etc. payments evictions, put freeze grocery prices, pay people enough money every month they're able make there's vaccine things safe. Something like $2,000/month per person. 

Billionaires profiteered $200+ billion time. mention billions free money ""loans"" businesses. got $1,200 check. need take time support American people families, **not** corporations, shareholders, CEOs. 

The economy come back. 3+ million dead people never will. 3 million people important Q3 Q4 profits.  Ok again, proportion matters, need certain amount anti bodies/t cells/ B cells protected, higher viral load higher number anti bodies needed protected. significant case reasons 1) monkeys got half dose since safety test many immunity cells. 2) booster shot would make immune response stronger 2-5 fold cases, monkeys lacked said booster. 3) monkeys directly challenged viral load 400X concentrated anyone would encounter naturally.

So, Japanese, lockdown, told part (mask stay home), eliminate problem Japan, legally, can't hard lockdown. worked well. lifted. Now, I'm going comment politics (a huge election last week, etc), but, mostly, Tokyo can't afford another lockdown. chances another slim.

So, without lockdown place, businesses could open. Friends could go bar together, go host clubs, sing karaoke, etc. activities common? Enclosed spaces without masks. enclosed spaces without masks dangerous takes one asymptomatic person too, people exposed.

So what's happening that, everything reopened people social again, people, young people, exposed. want social lives back, activities spreading virus.

The lack large spread, non cluster tracking also causing issues. prefectures reporting new cases last week known origin people traveling following precautions. Kagawa prefecture reported cancer patient left prefecture socially isolated wearing mask (still living home, treatment hospital), contracted it. showed signs tested, whoever caught either asymptomatic minor symptoms get test all.

So there's spread amongst people social again, there's spread people can't get tested they're clusters, asymptomatic spread. 

And, Japan officials treating like virus over, summer heat, people started wearing masks. everyone, lot still do, happening. 

Cherry top Japanese government going start financially helping domestic tourism covering percentage tourism costs people apply, thus encouraging domestic travel within country. That‚Äôs fire way thinking. bad president bad business man ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Yes right, still put numbers 1%. guesses would around 3% deaths/closed cases. 

Another question, deaths compared total cases closed cases, mean active cases still variable outcome? specifically tells stupid asses put fucking mask.

Put faces, help asses. have. I'd rather take bullet kneecaps choose go anywhere except work instead.

Listen, think it'd best wore mask possible, especially public transportation take it. 

That said, think deserve praise quoted. way responsible loads people living 2019. unlike EU, US right semblance political unity constitution one things still capable holding country together. thought closed stuff really hope natural selection work people, unfortunately, they're putting innocent people risk. weird mundane thing get riled over. honestly don‚Äôt understand anti-mask crowd.

Asymptomatic people, never develop symptoms, major vector spreading disease. (They still spread it, though!)

Presymptomatic people, currently symptoms go symptoms, account almost half cases themselves.

America everything wrong shows intention change. small minority take virus seriously anymore.  previously looked history Amway (I'd argue one largest, longest-running scams US history-- father law founder), I'd agree. fits perfectly. personally do? keep thinking back Italy 70k cases total adding like 1k-2k day going 'oh god doomed!'

Mr ""I take responsibility"" so, true. non peer reviewed pre-print paper states making rough approximations try compare 2 options (middle seat full vs empty). take mean paper comparison purposes doesn‚Äôt really correctly show danger flying.

**Reading entire 13 pages important news: numbers produced based bunch approximations. didn‚Äôt actually count people got infected COVID airplanes.** don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong post paper, don‚Äôt interpret actual measured risk. researcher using little data available try roughly approximate much risk filling middle seats creates.

2) mask must worn without exception (medical, religious, financial)

Unfortunately happen... significant left US Canada today move stuff lease up. never worried traveling another country. could US let get bad almost every nation control understand: children less likely catch COVID, totally safe stick thousands building recycled air 7 hours day. children less likely catch it, means they'll totally fine.

*edit: apparently need /s people able pick dripping sarcasm Summary Dr. Griffins comments:
He talks fast don‚Äôt get sometimes

1. He‚Äôs pulmonologist he‚Äôs working say retire comes back NYC everyone expects. Doctors overwhelmed. Daniel wants stick it. went medicine.

2. Questions clinicians ask
a. cases rising deaths?
Fauci twiv next week. Younger people infected. Mean 60 40. younger people get infected death rate lower. better managing cases - delay intubation, probing, steroids right time. Anticoagulants make huge difference. Avoid cocktail started. 

Investigation NY nursing homes. happen? March 22 pause order - sooner. March 25- governor advised Covid cases returned, made order. refunded May 10. disaster. Testing much better now. Florida good job nursing.
Governor resisting pressure allow return PCR positive. 

Question athlete - can‚Äôt workout PCR positive, can‚Äôt return nursing home PCR positive.

Deaths lag. expects 1000 again.

b. Testing - problems getting supplies. Delays getting results. 8 days places NYC. Commercial labs doubling time results.

c. Herd immunity, reinfection. Daniel readmitted patient positive March. better. got sick. tested PCR positive again. patient high antibodies plasma donor. low antibodies. similar case Washington, DC. sicker second time.

Starting worry like coronavirus long term immunity. Doctors reassuring people protected. may happen. Daniel worried. tough thing common coronavirus gives immunity reinfected multiple times milder cases second infection.

How know it‚Äôs recrudescence? don‚Äôt know. need sequence samples. huge effect, trials. NYC areas herd immunity, don‚Äôt know.

d. cell. Need studies.

e. Opening schools. Need reopen safely. Requires testing. learning. least half spread presymptomatic course asymptomatic spread without knowing.

3. Range neurological issues. Daniel seeing week 3 robust antibody response. Delusions. Saw throughout patients. Brain fog. Strokes saw, even outpatients. Delirium, psychosis. 

Not related virus brain. It‚Äôs immune response virus. Immune thromboembolic.

4. Story patients Queens 68%. don‚Äôt know protected. big issue mean winter. Queens devastated, hope immunity. need study. Hope it‚Äôs like SARS -1. get protective T-cell B-cell increase.

We know year happen. Let‚Äôs hope doesn‚Äôt happen vaccine immunity. virus ability affect immune response. 

5. Emails - 
a. 4 year old - Covid wasn‚Äôt supposed Pennsylvania February. symptoms MIS-C. way tell now? it‚Äôs antibody mediated, serology might avenue use. know present January. kid get follow like Kawasaki disease.

b. Daniel said serology starts trending down. correct? Yes, 40% people become sero negative. Slope goes groups.

c. Ivermectin - used South America, think? interesting. outside control studies. sure science work. studies. Ehhh happening New York too. idea US know Australia closed state borders. need permit go one state another.

The coordination American states would challenging given number states well political division/ approach handling covid. I'm reddit dummy reads lots lots science stuff actually smart people. 


My understanding outdoor transmission remains extremely rare. difficult become infected small, passing contact virus. generally needs lot virus built air gets body concentration mucosal immune response can't handle immediately.  outside, hard build concentration unless standing face face prolonged conversation. 


It's like peeing pool versus peeing ocean. terms population urban/suburban, something like 3/4s living within 50 miles NYC (Long Island, Westchester, Rockland, etc).

Source: native New Yorker Thanks! Yup, nothing we're talking about. Also, ignored circumstantial part. black man would get convicted body found exchanged heated words victim, physical evidence placing scene.

The statistic referenced nothing crimes committed, black people likely get convicted, likely commit crime. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* America. crazy! treat teachers babysitters, security guards, martyrs, etc. Jesus Christ definitely would.  Seems large variance, I've friends get results 2 days long 6 tampa area I'm holding two things right now.

1. America elects new president implements federal mandates authorizes relief packages make unjustifiable American break public health orders.
2. #1 happen, Trump complete 180 listens Fauci public health/science officers proper steps take (and actually implements them). OK. That's kind rational brain thinking, half took flipped out. Ha. Thank giving sane response!!!! Yes may part it, can't attribute whole thing protests. also holidays, reopenings, abysmal leadership, people general refusing distance wear masks. outside gatherings SEEM less problematic indoor, disingenuous say protests. Rule 4 sub, politics, can't even begin answer question let alone provide complete answer. National Records Scotland data shows extra 873 home March 16 June 29 compared five-year average period.  575 fewer cancer deaths normal hospitals

So actually overall \~300 excess deaths cancer (note: *excess* deaths, total deaths cancer). others I'ld dig follows bit more.

Edit: yo arrive 11am

Hmm, see problem.

(I beach since February, even normal times, go morning riffraff still asleep.) That's super bug is.

It fatal Ebola per infection, killing far people total Ebola ever has. Ebola strikes fast hard much less capacity spread. Belongs r/dataisterrifying

Edit - course exists shows COVID data. FML Eh Ohio shortages shelves fully stocked partially true, made incorrect statements. Firstly yes likely pretty normally antibody titers wane initial wave infection drop zero (I think current antibody tests great quantitating protective titer point possible). B cells (which produce antibodies cells) differentiate two different types cells activation. Memory B cells, reactivated upon secondary infection quickly produce strong antibodies. plasma cells, live bone marrow typically long times constantly pump antibodies. transition point infection short lived long lived plasma cells may account transient drop antibody titers long lived cells get going.

On cell side two types. CD4 cells, act helpers antibody responses provide signals B cells produce antibodies. CD8 cells, directly kill infected cells. develop memory cells respond faster upon secondary infection.

When think immunity second infection, first think antibodies plasma cells since directly neutralize virus fast without additional reactivation immune response. fail though would activate second level response memory B cells CD4/CD8 cells make new antibodies (from B cells) kill infected cells (from cells). memory cells allow response happen matter days instead week like initial response.

Holy shit joking M-M-M-MUH FREEDUMBS!!! Americans afflicted two epidemics - disease body disease mind. germany stay home

The ~30% Americans pathologically selfish make kind policy impossible here. First all, way state handling right horrid. Every state look NY see devastating affects virus needed done. Second, due way they‚Äôve approached pandemic (with deception denial) would never trust info linked state governor mayor done everything distort numbers obvious since pandemic control STILL haven‚Äôt locked hard. Third, days ago scientist large earned CDC recognize virus fact airborne (which like viruses case) mandates week ago based outdated data. plenty articles stating outside isn‚Äôt truly safe, hence, everyone wearing face masks. Fourth, plenty places around world saw major decreases seeing spikes handled way are.

 Oxford best chance deliver year end lot happen bw p3 trials beginning next couple months.  Late April Actually. There's place risk going zero unless live padded room rest life. that's case, one allowed outdoors indoors around people reason...see ridiculous sounds? Perfect enemy good; we're going able prevent every single case occurring trying so. countries working preventing outbreaks measures work. Countries--Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore--that efficiently contract trace found outbreaks stem almost constantly indoor enclosed spaces that's focus needs be. 

But want call countries liars, guest. Man must suck 3 months behind news that's proven false. Hell, they‚Äôre still active, it‚Äôs sadly frowned upon now. fookin Disney, I'm sure could print cartoon mouths masks. Gargling high pitch voice: ""a little green envy, you?

If America looks bad overall ""what per capita"".

If America looks bad per capita ""oh compare countries states""

Newsflash son. Comparing EU countries US states even work favour. NY deaths per capita EU nation. goes new Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut Rhode capita definitely useful, really appropriate directly compare per capita rates nations one 100x total population and/or land mass.

Additionally, results likely take ""several days"" could well get results 14 day self-isolation period. also apparently point confusion nurse husband spoke said need self-isolate, wear mask maintain social distancing whereas nurse spoke checked doctor said need self-isolate (which planning anyway).

Long story short, whole thing mess. mean yes testing 70k people per day. CDC said actual number infected 10x confirmed. NY testing capturing cases There‚Äôs 8 billion people. million day would take years get every, yes, totally possible.

Edited trillion billion know people talk wanting take rushed vaccine?

Also, husband CEO Amway (the king pyramid scams). didn‚Äôt believe March masked ASAP. know PPE works, know N95s work. know airborne droplet precautions since countries already implemented (China since January), already knew virus aerosolized. 

I knew anyone said anything anti-masking gen pop need mask DANGEROUS misinformation order save PPE (politicians) internally already knew hell coming way. TSA managing?

Let's say antibodies last long hoped. means may revaccinate like currently influenza. ideal something world live comes that. start showing symptoms like 2-3 days in, almost 14 days in. 

This means 4th July infections starting pop up.  Wasnt always case? Holyfuckingshit.

Airlines hear you. Airlines don‚Äôt care. Hey, harsh. mouse indifferent death. Reconcile deaths, find worldometer. Uh huh. basically reopened bars restaurants taking week off. vigilant early made sacrifices somehow people decided meant would never spread here.  FYI, [this posted /r/dallas. sad. People need begin proactively working physical health anticipation contracting virus.

Guys obese. I‚Äôm hating. place defined tourism pretty isolated? Land lakes florida here.

Too dancing grave supposed dead rednecks....It's even touching trailer parks rural areas areas associate politics dislike.

The cities destroyed this..economically people wise. Tampa bad fucking ambulances 24:7 every 5 minutes. rural area live people cutting grass working home. work Fowler seen atleast 6 people collapse need ambulance walking university mall parking lot since friday. work shut permanently working home. seen several people laying side walls broad daylight lifeless 

This stop. Full shut immediately. Desantis needs go. killing people mostly color.

We barely 1% infected. gets 20 25% hospital workers probably wont even come work. job entertain magical thinking. don‚Äôt think Florida lock again. It‚Äôs going keep going we‚Äôre infected dead vaccine. need 10 times many deaths beat new york Yes thread schools dems planning reopen gop states. I'm dem way. supporting truth instead partisan hatred like person responding to. Right. here. deathly afraid getting plane, might consider it. unsure best. cells nothing base type strategy on. clothing requirements encroachment rights, mask is? walk main street completely naked I'll get arrested probably register sex offender. encroaching rights too? welcome apocalypse, assholes heroes, nice day, want reincarnate another earth.... kids school get away longer. Plus Summer beach towns infinitely fun Winter. lot towns ghost towns October March. Every single person government supports sort smear campaign action omission ashamed held accountable future. 

You trying discredit medical expert comfortable giving political narrative want given. getting people killed. Shame you. 

This absolute insanity. doesn‚Äôt matter fall politically, recognize is. It‚Äôs absolute sham. Hey it‚Äôs old pre existing health conditions? would hope Florida would better health system 3+ months watch NY &amp; countries around world adapt learn manage COVID patients better. That's big factor people choose forget. NY &amp; rest world deaths piling everyone basically throwing shit wall treatment wise seeing stuck.

Regardless, makes Florida terrible right part, world KNOWS drastically slows spread. Mask wearing, social distancing, limiting/closing stuff like bars/clubs/indoor dining/gyms, reducing staff best businesses ability, etc. Florida doing? point, ""suggesting"" wearing masks, finally closing bars weeks allowing operate, insisting schools fully open, Disney open. anybody go ""well look numbers"" say Florida anything right fucking hilarious.  Let see... April, May, June, July.

That's long time take single action. Maybe next 4 months, come plan actually manage infections.

I would really like parents visit granddaughter, America everyone's no-fly list. True true. thank putting bullets. We‚Äôd saving since father got laid off. never time money go, grandparents getting older afraid we‚Äôd never get go family. Unfortunately Tommy lost fight virus grandfather currently ventilator. Covid destroyed family nobody even warned us could happen... wouldn‚Äôt gone knew risks, everyone said safe say anyway. fact, saying NOW. People like reason America raging dumpster fire. backbone. never let supporters forget America. Texas 2 weeks ago believe. point shouldnt assuming actually survey teachers. Many people teachers subreddit pointed frustrations many teachers still want go back. need numbers instead assuming Salon, gold standard scientific research internet study didn‚Äôt look vaccines... even read it? Jesus Christ tragic thing even shocking anymore There's one, Yeah terrifying. means July 4th numbers even yet. Knowing this, entire state no-holds-bared lockdown?! He's lucky he's getting Rensesivir. anyone else think covid deaths marked inaccurately? Like guy probably died something else injected covid arrived hospitals. think could pay go Chili's we're pandemic. little nothing even live Cuba difference US Europe European countries fully independent shut travel countries. mechanism shutting internal travel within US. Back March/April, Northeastern states infecting rest country. Now, South West infecting back. see Covid-19 ever controlled manner! US simply far big deal single entity, different parts country infected different rates. really feel needs internal borders right now, state/region was/is highly infected cut places many infections. Think China back January. locked Hubei province prevented people inside traveling out, that's temporary internal border. can't solve big problem without first breaking smaller problems manageable proportions attack. amazing mask refusing Karens Kevins suddenly discover *can* survive wearing mask, refusing means boarding plane? almost like strict enough mask wearing policy effective. T-cells trigger production antibodies? person protect families. state help you, fed govt help you, protect yourself.

Honestly, be.  Exactly, showing higher number know persuade people obviously use head rely others research.. that's call people sheep.. news tomorrow could say there's one case one death people would like ""oh God gone go now"" Florida isnt competition want imagine point articles get folks stop thinking ‚Äúwell we‚Äôll rely herd immunity.‚Äù essentially don‚Äôt want anything little changes minds. whether article changes another story, it‚Äôs complicated. annual passholder, frustrating situation. Disney extend annual pass' expiration date amount time parks closed, they're open again, expiration date ticking away. stay Disney resort currently, limited park reservations 3 days, park hopping allowed currently. never stay Disney property limitations, ones mention, annoying pass expiration date ticking away. 

We'd rather visit anytime soon what's going on, especially big limitations place. wish would've extended expiration dates bit given limitations. Content warning: Edgelord think chiba using excuse shut protest control citizens. 300K Dead, 400K Dead, maybe 500K, I'm really looking forward fall combo flu season coronavirus going national debacle. guess going look two data points ... like Norway, Denmark think Austria (?). Impose strict fines breaking rules ü§∑ ohhh yea definitely saw headlines today. guess saw headline regarding LA epicenter California US I'm waiting months see trials early administration combination zinc, guess studies never come. Instead get conclusions based administration terminally ill COVID patients. Based current policies Delta southwest seem care American United. sure others. know bridge. located late little. Twenty students rotating every hour... [This school district largest city Texas.

I‚Äôm city, outlying district.

This insane. Fauci good work. doesn‚Äôt set policy; recommend based science data. president authority approve/set national guidelines. HHS purview executive branch. important people infected wear them... yet idea many actually infected many show symptoms testing incredibly limited... see problem statement? full context actually worse. 

And say, ""But knew anything virus!"" don't. enough data China countries easily spread high percentage non symptom carriers. literal months figure thing out. Either grossly incompetent straight lied American public protect colleagues. that, well established masks reduce spread respiratory illnesses... basic concept new anyone world medicine. I‚Äôm surprised Floridians still care enough go get tests. guess meantime we'll stay focused treatments, like Dexamethasone, last heard pretty okay. I‚Äôm seeing reports Miami 30 probably right. Howdy, Dowdy. Highest Covid-19 cases single day yet still see cars plates piling rentals onto beaches, local bar &amp; grilles packed high heaven maskless crowds partying live music, county commissioner straight closing anything.

We already children counties transported PICU severe covid symptoms hospitalizations starting rise. 

And yet idiots zip code still spouting masks work, need get back work. 

I'm scared children. parents complete idiot sandwiches. 

At point, I'm considering grocery shopping city limits since mayor mandated mandatory masks everyone steep fines anyone violating order. many businesses voluntarily shuttered doors went back take-out/delivery only. 

But area. Forget that, gotta protect muh freedoms. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  exactly ‚Äúperson like me‚Äù? Someone wants see America get 100 year pandemic? Someone understands fights better fit later, put politics aside order see action save many Americans?

Cool. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm ‚Äúthe reason America dumpster fire‚Äù. 

Actually, I‚Äôm American either. look south see multiple variations American idiots. blindly follow moronic president making stupid decisions - blinded hatred they‚Äôre willing put lives risk *slightly* walks back anti-trump narrative they‚Äôre obsessed with. people level idiot. You‚Äôre latter. People good physical health, zero serious health conditions died virus, people poor physical health least one pre existing medical condition survived virus. virus discriminate thing helps social distancing, wearing mask, washing hands staying fuck home. can't excuse past ineptitude already killed thousands finally right thing. That's game. Lower bar much bare minimum touted intellectual victory. ""I respect Dr. Fauci lot, Dr. Fauci 100 percent right also necessarily, admits that, whole national interest mind. looks narrow public health point view,"" Giroir said.

He looks public health point view job. Sorry repost. thought interesting point huge financial burden Covid family, even family member full health recovery. Forest Fires: discredit Earth Science. 
virus: discredit Medical Science. 
Russian meme warfare: discredit INTELLIGENCE.

One answer problem. Obey Trump! way see it, schools Florida reopen things bad, teachers likely going get infected, America means crippling medical debt best case scenario. understand would horrible, think losing job better alternative. live state vote truly doesn‚Äôt matter never bothered. 

I‚Äôll voting year wear hazmat suit isolate 14 days after. It‚Äôs first time I‚Äôve felt vote mattered- even it‚Äôs symbolic, want world know part fix problem. probably right. No. It‚Äôs people like think stop vs trying evolve. Right. guy Mars. true. say Japan, ""they're sending best"".  Trump GOP crew going wish away ownership pandemic response blaming others lethargy incompetence.

They much like someone seeing house catch fire decides, ""I'll watch see goes out,"" doesn't, goes berserk Fire Department.

edited word ardent trump hater, thinking better late never. love people figure game system. attack Trump starting wear mask. pathetically late, right: better never starting. We'll wait see continues.

But **will not** stand continued gaslighting American public world. shit needs called out. clearly masks months. intransigence cost lives. unfortunately covid-free country anymore, national shame, Kabukicho. 2 weeks funding get, afterwards enough money keep furloughed workers paid longer. People homeless starving shutdown beyond timeframe. Or, live Europe Canada, little dollars. Trans individuals, least United States, quite well informed risks HRT bring. one goes therapist recommendation HRT, risks brought therapy upon referral endocrinologist. one goes Informed Consent, provider ensure individual understands risks starting HRT. [Here Informed Consent described Dr. Man. want cry. love guys. safe. Please. testing taking long. Upto 8-10 days. sad. I‚Äôm sorry need rant...
If anyone knows report places crazy risky business northeastern Florida. Major gas stations even soap disinfectant social distancing. Sent mandatory Fashion Masks, medical use employees won‚Äôt enforce masks customers. Stupid neoprene foam mask! It‚Äôs useless. drowning here. getting hand! [38] them! Interesting, good eye. get accurate numbers categories?  also wonder many Disneyworld visitors traveling state. I‚Äôm guessing won‚Äôt count Florida‚Äôs numbers capacity contact tracing visitors? live south. see people regulating posting ""jokes"" want kill democrats. scary. post things public social media. care people see majority people circle feel way do. It‚Äôs people like ensure it‚Äôs *not* with.  can't ban interstate travel? Australia I‚Äôd gladly runs day two means normalcy again. Money, money , money.,, many cases Florida California too.

-	Trump. Probably.  Daniel said husband able articulate words, way communicate showing affection. ""There's comfort comes him, holding hand,"" said. ""That's able love I'm able comfort now. see settling that, noticed last night relaxed getting ready bed.""

This made cry. wish would able love like that. I've seen disney world president parks. Employees like tries care. Bob chapek hand total prick. I‚Äôve heard since start June, still major spike deaths. read intewebs, must true /s like Fox NEws reported this. title almost same, tacked ""while world see cases spike"", trying downplay America dropping ball ability test... wtf meant do, shut down? Sure CA bit proactive, statewide action started day NY's did. 

The real failure Fed's approach testing -- initially wanted develop would let states others get approved. course ended fucking up. guess trump wanted control info flow given hoax rhetoric, led virus spreading far action taken. 

We people coming planes Italy, showing symptoms day later, sent home went hospital b/c CDC authorizing testing people a) exposure confirmed case b) travel history China. Even Italy lockdowns place, still could get tested based travel history Italy. Worse still, know community spread already happening weeks yet none suspected cases met federal guidelines test. hospitals choice, testing option CDC facilities (which took almost week way) b/c rules trump admin initially put place. 'china flu' them, come china, it. fucking wrong were.

Cuomo issued shutdown order March 20th, point ~7000 confirmed cases ~50 deaths *in total*. week prior first death count ~500 cases. numbers piled 48hrs pulled trigger. late? course hindsight, simply data b/c testing situation terrible. 

Now compare today. Florida 10,360 new new cases 95 new deaths *yesterday alone* (*edit: apparently 15,000 new cases today*). desantis statewide shutdown?

And course followed cuomo said, acknowledges past mistakes one accountable them. %positive high it‚Äôs easier... deserve get. brought upon themselves. bad others sense put jeopardy. lot sunshine days India. Even prescription glasses use fieldwork sunglasses. Sounds like need read news south border.  Even cartels protecting people. agree hate, anger, absolute fury them, may die willful ignorance.

But allow hate destroy family. deserve it.

They deserve pity. deserve time handle grief loved one private, grief may die actions.

They deserve grieve peace. deserve abject hatred. monstrous.

The loss him, actions, shamefully horrendous. Yes, family **SHOULD FEEL SHAME COMPLICIT.** ***NOT***, though, anger actions directed them, fault. made decision free will.

Yes, condemn actions. I'm going spew vitriol far wide. That's behavior divide us even more. need one people fight this. Let join fighting save us all. Let spread message shame far wide. Yes, hate them, destroy sense hatred, sense injured pride.

Yes, justified anger, lord better them. made horrible, horrible decision. Let deal consequences private. face legal consequences, let face heads bowed full shame. 

Your decisions may saved life, somehow make better them. led astray, went along gleefully. Give chance come back. need ever, now.

Allow opportunity speak ignorance, done. Openly hating suppress message shame, suppress horrible, terrible experience they've created, may die actions. 

Let spread message shame, others like might come back path, rest people fighting this, fight together! already compromised. likely virus running rampant America's military, reflects treated general populace.

There news Okinawans angry AF US brought infected troops island. way get tested referring demand capacity (and factoring risk, etc) half country hates Trump passion christ would listen. Many many many people go bankrupt medical bills. absolutely clueless. would like, link follow Florida's covid grew Dana Point, Ca back late 80‚Äôs. ( think every 80‚Äôs teen movie yeah school) 5‚Äô7 220lbs. One three fat kids school. two played football. tormented daily, ended dropping out. shocked many obese kids high school near house, would another kid school. Interesting insight. makes sense want make numbers look better.  Yeah, long functions diverse enough mostly span R_n. Fourier series, randomly chosen, example concept. canonical ""introduction linear algebra"" example want learn more.

I see logistic-ish added sin term try model day-of-week effects. make sense data science perspective, makes fit look better. 

The proper way would sort deconvolution (we know kernel, related day week probably estimate pretty well) take 7-day moving average. blips holiday weekends stuff in-exact anyway. 35 years old South Florida. Yeah likely Where?? Japanese many foreign friends assure Japanese treat nonwhite/Asian foreigners way worse white foreigners, one stereotype ""Asian americans"" supposed be. Interesting. I've trying two weeks urgent cares CVS offer tested turned away due overwhelming demand since low risk group, pre-existing conditions, symptoms. coworker say waited 8 hours get tested week difficulty getting tested along large inaccuracy kits, see little motivation get tested unless required get time work. see value macro level science. fatigue since Feb rather one less thing day. 

I simply assumed positive since experienced symptoms. also pretend everyone else different strain try protect playing safe. context, italy 578 deaths/million Florida 200 deaths/million. Hurr durr narcolepsy, fast vaccine unsafe hurr durr flu, bill gates wants profits hurr durr.

Don't think Americans smarter us. larger population idiots total Ak-47s illegal. I've owned couple. Aks, way, automatic weapons. sold States semiautomatic.

In addition, automatic weapons illegal own. There's process involved getting class 3, Americans automatic weapons, legally. happen Europe.

It initial outbreak Italy India. heard reports since February China rare. Even Europe. US seems lot prevalent. higher numbers schools closed. barely testing anyone schools closed. tens thousands new cases probably every day then. Thats get tens thousands dying weeks later - I‚Äôm trying find email saw posted regional teachers group easy ways contact trace cellphone data without impacting privacy *at all* \- like literally zero impact.

It works app sends random numbers nearby phones, phones record numbers they've received. Then, someone tested positive, tell app, sends message database ""these numbers correspond someone tested positive"", people's apps access database 'heard' number tested positive, inform user.

No way figure number belonged who, yet still contact tracing.

Note also add limitations like ""have close one another 3 minutes (separate, consecutive numbers)"" things like that, avoid low chance infection passing someone street keeping 2 meter distance, still counting person sat next public transport five minutes. #It child abuse let minor get fat woman's kids are. üò§

Black Lives Matter

It criminal! 4 surviving children. obese. üò≠ Objectively so. one listen felon- want stir pot. People shitting Brazil plenty. Bolsanaro gets absolutely roasted macho man bullshit around covid. Slashdot. name haven‚Äôt heard long time Right.

Probably coincidence. changed ""crowded outdoor events"" ''protests"" changing entire meaning statement like disingenuous weasel are.

The protestors mostly wearing masks. little fact purposely omitted. popular though. heard ticket get $100. people much money throw away? thought schools facilities closed April? Biological, economic psychological warfare best, 100 years shown history books greatest takeover human history without using traditional weapons. deaths really increasing (they aren't) what? means Covid far less lethal thought. that's good thing. Brilliant work guys Look yourself. mean arizona almost twice many people New Zealand, regardless many people also stated epicenter college called arizona state university. whole city college town mentality spreads nearby cities, towns, counties. mostly young college kids couldnt care less virus.

Personally, still rocking Lone Ranger Mask Paywall want know can't find salt free canned tomatoes anywhere. 

Did everyone decide start making spaghetti sauce scratch sudden??? pray Florida ü§™  Americans well culture... \*billion Try like 34.99 breathed sick person's breath minimum claiming you‚Äôre handling better everyone? archived copy incoming Yes, makes sense realize America stupidity habit. God. There's rona Space Mountain! banking vaccine make ""safe"" that's problem right may never vaccine. Wife got tested yesterday Midwest. Total shitshow. Nurse mask chin, 3pm 2 tests left. sites closed day. 5-7 days results. 

It sucks federal leadership needed doesn‚Äôt come, really sucks choice. positive person could dead 7 days false negatives still high, I‚Äôd get ‚Äúshe‚Äôs negative Covid‚Äù message time goddamn funeral. 


Reminder: 12 (or more?) countries recorded first cases us functionally zero community spread. Don‚Äôt give bullshit big America is, takes courage sacrifice beat thing, leaders pushing people hit Disney World. 1918 people literally starved get food pandemic reason. http://archive.is/f2krd know good, kind people here. patients helps get shift everything us Orlando right now, can't help feel damn exhausted.   worry, us got it. Surely two headlines mutually exclusive, right? RIGHT?! Nicely done, guys. Keep way. 

-fellow Canadian  Arizona got call health department saying tested positive 4 days test

I still haven‚Äôt received actual test result online profile visit though it‚Äôs month

All data delayed would work way service people allowed stay home. poor getting selected dumbass rich safe castles. located?

There absolutely reports like countries months, including China beginning. He‚Äôs point every week. Whatever he‚Äôs seeing clinically, weeks less, see posted news articles. simply incorrect, though. 

If person obese heart attack, stroke, goes ketoacidosis due diabetes, etc - sure, obese killed them. 

But obese person gets COVID-19 still died due virus, obesity contributing factor. 

Would say people diseases impact immune systems died diseases rather covid? Probably not. Trying hammer point home 'omg obese bad' fine, disingenuous try pretend COVID-19 ultimately killed them. thing video shows clearly much CO2 must building inside mask mask interfering God's perfect breathing system. also noticed holding gun also shows constitutional rights infringed. also looked really hot itchy. wearing mask inside. think touched face. Plus bacteria, something. You‚Äôre far off, UN defeated Charlie Chaplin UN-Nazi‚Äôd world. Well first all, thank getting back me, appreciate offer modest upvote token appreciation. 

It's funny feel vindicated feel vindicated time. think anywhere near 90% correct saying months ago. 

I appreciate admit underestimating overflow hospitals. I'd appreciate could also address number deaths comparison seasonal flu. 

You said probably won‚Äôt kill seasonal flu, takes 400,000 every year.

But global deaths already hit 600k that's short months disease circulating globally despite lockdowns throughout world people wearing masks social distancing....all things people typically flu season. 

Another thing said EARTH give inkling fuck disease

Which responded really care give fuck not. promise soon will.

You laughing disease back then. still laughing? think fair say effects economic. Sure global economy taken huge hit far that. Life changed. know life has. office work closed months remain closed rest year. remote employee. can't travel abroad places world....we've banned. restaurant movie theater concert months. able watch sports months stopped playing games. Real estate city 15% economic factor also result people leaving city going countryside. 

Would say life changed all? someone know thing yet? deaths (I hope not!). know two people lost parent thing...very sad. Meanwhile parents leave house 3 months account high risk (and everything closed). depressed feel many years life left losing time could enjoying themselves. retired years ago. truth know lot people depressed. virus absolutely horrible world...I think overstating impact back originally chatted. make double here. This! Remember okay go good time Disneyland okay burn community. disconnect reinfections possible reinfections norm. Pretty big disconnect there. still (perhaps willfully point) forgetting patients. 

That's pretty high bar media pretty much means nobody scientist gets say anything COVID. know politicians anyway nurse chime experiences? Extreme stupidity still possible. must reason Trump rushed take dementia test. really ‚Äúradical left‚Äù asking doubt would complied. Testing doesn‚Äôt much number deaths. Anyone suspected covid-19 hospital would tested whether overall testing numbers big small. Don‚Äôt testing? Paywall Jade Helm fools yet? very. letting child psychology guide policies? Continued lockdowns going seriously devastate kids‚Äô mental health. We‚Äôre screwing youngest people virus almost kills elderly. Direct link can't make up. Wishing speedy recovery better health, hoping husband able remain good health! Hmm party thinks masks Satan ""That might become dominant strain really moved Europe Americas certainly see Arizona,"" mutated strain virus one researchers first identified April dominant strain Arizona seems originated Europe. Researchers initially thought strain infectious strains, merely dominant due chance.

It's strain swept Europe. different strain took Wuhan. (above quote article).

From read, D614G mutation deadly. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs safe make assumption yet. what‚Äôs gonna happen next week Sure... employer pay us quarantine results come back negative. could miss week pay use week paid vacation. wants risk can't afford risk it? right. growing learning disability smaller classes teachers aids. great much older normal teachers. would help tutor also help kids behavioral issues physical disabilities. Like grandmas school. kids depended :( never release stuff gets filter. Ah well :) told society basically can‚Äôt function reality situation.

Unfortunately virus really care Omg going people already embrace herd immunity ideology counting follow tests. test positive twice count 2 cases. Abbott straight let mayors personally rescinded plans working places hotspots. Honestly waiting see bad Abbott let get letting mayors go back working. another one: Italy's largest increase March 22. day, Italy 6500 new cases. Italy 60 million people, Florida 21. Everywhereville, USA published yesterday, paper linked bottom. brains rewired short memory- April hospitals Miami threatening overwhelmed would expected mandatory city wide lockdowns deploying FEMA response teams- shrugging hoping go away own. 

As country behaving like mentally ill patient manic episode. Definitely cold knocks weeks, hope stay good health stay safe! literally resigned attacked industry over, pushing measures guess mind, people can't redeem themselves

Most posted sounds contrived, like written guy's public relations consultant.

Still, yes, could potentially redeem himself. Maybe missed part already stated he'd need order accomplish that? Tell lives modestly now, donates book proceeds, gave money back earned lying, etc., he's still living like king, actually lesson others here... enough fools accept apology keep blood money, questions asked?

As stands now, unmoved story surrounding awakening tears brought eyes. Anyone read newspapers back knew healthcare crisis, people descending onto free, open-air clinics, that. guess money making suffering, though, allowed ignore actually forced see eyes? make admirable. Less loathsome, yes, admirable, no. Hospital ships useless stories saw. even begin speak everyone. 
Facile commentary, Dan ü§Ø
As MANY college educated people (nurses, entrepreneurs) losing houses due pandemic

Covid changed TON.
You done NOTHING facilitate positive change
Get bent ! Giant turkey leg, churros, side covid please. 18.99 plus tax sir using CPAP cleaner UV santiize everyday things leave house

So, better Might uncomfortable hear obese going statistically kill near certainty decades earlier virus whatever death rate number want.

This science data. mega obese take decades life. UP's positivity rate 3%. clearly see data! think they‚Äôre trying stop late night bars/partying. Even Cuba wouldn‚Äôt want it. I've scarlet fever sounds like covid worse, high fever (they kept covering ice) got rash private areas (hospital took pics) fine 5 days. Sick fuck/ tired / achy etc. 11 decades ago. lasting issues left hospital. College student here, I'm going back school virus mess over. know first hand bad people takes one person ruin things. trust school aged people regarding virus. Thank information! hope wife stay good health! Weird happening US. Even covidpositive subreddit people US. 

Over cleared virus give dexamethasone 5-10 day course fixes chronic inflammation. Multiple people know prolonged symptoms recovered normal. willingness gamble wear mask public move things it‚Äôs hard Many Europeans too. Nowhere world remaining lockdown indefinitely nowhere planning to. success stories start end opened smart.

Florida's strategy strategy sense Vichy France strategy. something properly designed save economy, capitulation. wear mask right? social distance properly...go early morning late night one there... foolish comment observation. wrong... Professor Raciniello geek sense humor. mean, sparrows getting some, eat lot shit get fed. Disney *executives* wanted this, employees ‚ÄúIm voting trump!! don‚Äôt want socialized communist healthcare. Canadians come across US border healthcare bad.‚Äù 

-my mother care lays guidelines, *teachers* feel safe *parents* feel like concerns adequately addressed, Trump issues edicts threats cares teachers kids simply show up. We'll see massive non-compliance. Given resurgence cases, might well attempting herd immunity ala Sweden rock solid testing, social distancing, mask wearing protocols *strictly enforced*. US literally got Mexico.... guess NBA postpone cancel within 10 days. Look what‚Äôs happening college campuses ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù football workouts. Infected player rates doubling every days. college athletic season fall. mean get young people suffering education that's going major disaster shit going spread like FUCK schools prolong whole thing, even expect Corona 2022 point half ass it. numbers posted cumulative, past. Look numbers actually coming today. past weeks, what's happening NOW. happened previously Ah well tell what's wrong information article correct myself. probably drank bleach, give break. fault lying wearing masks. Fauci: **Right United States, people walking around LaPook:¬†You‚Äôre sure it? people listening really closely Fauci:¬†‚Ä¶**There‚Äôs reason walking around mask.**

March 2020

Dr.Fauci 60 minutes interview Yeah, intellectually dishonest compare NY's April numbers current FL numbers. run money buy tinfoil wear head? Well first confirms already know: people get infections, immune systems react. course less symptomatic patients robust immune response, that‚Äôs they‚Äôre less symptomatic. study lacks data science make conclusions one way another effective cells far providing immunity infection‚Äî know sure need antibodies. study doesn‚Äôt examine follow patients responsible samples looked at. Combine fact Sweden vested political interest supporting strategy shut despite relative underperformance compared neighboring countries one question motives behind attempting publish piece. 

Meanwhile, we‚Äôve got redditors posting drawing conclusions without scientific literacy understand what‚Äôs going end false narrative makes way around internet encourages risky behavior. Risky behavior magnifies intensity prolongs duration pandemic US creates cascade events magnify intensity prolong duration negative economic effects (we‚Äôre talking YEARS maybe even decade more!), may exceed threshold ability come back. potential become greatest disaster US history killing people civil war causing economic destruction Great Depression. think millions people never came back Great Recession 2008... *12 years ago.* 

So yeah, paper people flinging around like kind evidence everything going okay part problem need go away. follow comedy purposes Wow, never thought police blotter would pure comedy gold, Floridaman:

-Trump's fragile ego insecurity True true. followers exactly says, even little bit late better late never. I‚Äôm favor taking appropriate pandemic control measures, I‚Äôd like assurances people engineered clusterfuck described article going things differently (and how) fired agreeing let charge things again. Sometimes lose battle win war shocked too. There‚Äôs drive-in testing everywhere - need symptoms doctor referral it‚Äôs free. Agree. 40% conservative number Gotta kind stupid go church middle this. ‡≤†_‡≤†

If everyone agreed wearing mask, new records several times week. 

The percentage testing positives increased well number tests. 

Asymptomatic cases still spread.

Italy slashed daily new cases almost nothing, growing quickly. post science sub COVID-19 dont think sway alot them. Desantis didnt lock first time getting sued it, may happen form class action suit get anything done. thing fix control virus state (florida) full lockdown. Hey, guess US exported Japan? Coronavirus via outbreaks military bases. Japanese pissed it. imagine. Many countries got control, evidence science based approach overwhelming. anything spreading Mexico. Ny flattening now, like countries got hit earlier. Florida got hit later. Comparing current rates huge apples oranges comparison. 

What data say deaths overall though? shows lot, lot deaths NY state. Tens thousands more. States like florida incredibly low death rates comparison. hey, continue smug. month ago, best friend intended going Florida next weekend visit friend &amp; get enjoy nice beach. talked since watching growth lack fucks given Florida month, Cuomo put quarantine place asked one weekend worth 2 weeks working. made smart choice thankfully. 10% consider antibodies 30% consider people beat tcells based Swedish tcell study. I'm getting deja vu Well there‚Äôs time place it.. unless ‚Äúyou're hospital, especially particular setting, talking lot soldiers people cases got operating table‚Äù still don‚Äôt need one.


/s...? crazy part there's really persistent rumor government over-reporting COVID deaths. Got tested Bulgaria, knew results next day.

That April. Let‚Äôs goooo takes incredibly long time produce many doses, efficacy large scale likely enough vaccine rushed much. Keep mind never single vaccine effective coronavirus, mention developed vaccine strain virus even sure still exist time distributed. Strains mutate, even vaccines developed previous strains help cases short term, enough warrant full reopening even everyone got vaccine. Oxford vaccine currently efficacy testing, know anything results come back. Vaccines always taken minimum multiple years successfully develop, makes think we've able make much progress much less time type virus we've never successfully made vaccine for, amount virologists working it? There's always backlog every weekend Bro dog leash wait till chips implanted brain We‚Äôre numbers recent surges? question asked? wanted go back general massive infection rates locally?  really vague numbers probably represent opinions current situation. Valid. troops represent Justice All. taught read getting Masters Statistics That‚Äôs I‚Äôm hoping well Modern commercial airplanes high efficiency ventilation systems fully exchange indoor air outdoor air every 20 minutes filters kill viruses. Much safer environment small shop recirculates air. Whatever tell get rest idiots wear one. gets people actually wear it, honestly point cares politics 

We can't go back time make goon 4 months ago show leadership example, maybe opens doors better path lies much team must double-take actually tells truth.  That‚Äôs I‚Äôve trying say! US government going hold vaccine profit billion two, giving vaccine going back normal economic activity would profit tens billions. We‚Äôll definitely second wave. Thanks southern states! It‚Äôs simple situation Mexico. large number people within country, can‚Äôt go somewhere quarantine/social distance.  lot Mexicans need work daily longer means income. 


The government definitely blame though. places like Spain get like 25% use, absolute tops. people suck technology ~~if~~ **when** reopening causes big outbreak among students teachers, including fatalities...

FTFY. We're already inundated cases come Mexico.  schools definitely money. I'd like money back gave scientology Catholic Church. could used update school infrastructure least give chance opening safelyb areas lower infection rates. studies differentiate asymptomatic pre symptomatic.

For example: tested diamond princess passengers/crew (which great test case controlled environment, closely monitored, universally tested) half time illness run course, 18% truly asymptomatic, went develop say that's accurate approximation asymptomatic rate mass population tests illness run course. yikes. least body producing antibodies........ data exist show amount tests taking place state confirm rise positives aren‚Äôt correlated increase testing?

So NYC still testing 10K per day negative would serve prove Trumps point wrong right? worse part tests limited number, people waited line hours find site ran tests. test sites get 100 tests day. 40-50 cars close day. heard BBC Rwanda using group testing too. [NEW HIGH SCORE](http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Nick-Swardson-Being-Sarcastic-About-His-High-Score-In-Grandmas-Boy.gif) gaslighting carnival sideshow administration.

The supporter administration brainwashed followers Charles Manson. Hes never given straight answers held consistent point views. pretty simple. Mandate masks. uncomfortable, one likes wearing people wear dont to. October 2020 2021 hate think totals going 9 days current stats reflection conditions around 2 weeks ago (9 days get results + days time exposure time symptoms/getting tested). Especially considering Florida still much anything re-opening Disney Land... thought saying it‚Äôs nothing concerned about. agree 100%. Kids getting take care away need could require hospitalization/medical care. Sorry misinterpreted question ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è exactly - &amp; contact tracers come in. since it'll slower spread saw March, easily implement interventions necessary avoid widespread infections. long people cooperate w/ contact tracers, wear masks, continue social distance, pretty good spot fall. can't say rest country #winning Obesity deadly many ways understand socioeconomic issues contribute it.

As income rises diet becomes better. 

I'm going say feel family hope everyone else safe. Back late March knew guy coughing Thursday. Stayed home work Friday felt bad. Sunday went emergency room bad fever, gave flu test strep test, negative, send home. stays home Monday, still fever, cough hard time breathing.

Tuesday text ask something, responds.

Tuesday afternoon boss tells passed away COVID. Said heart attack. Dude 30s obese.

Little hard believe. Lol nba going make fucking millions dollars playoffs alone there, sounds like economy everyone stay home, everyone stay home year(s).

Well, they‚Äôll get left behind new normal. clinging dying industries like bars, restaurants, live music traditional higher education get dragged kicking screaming socially distant future. didn‚Äôt ban lightbulbs protect candle-makers, reject NAFTA protect factory workers; similarly, we‚Äôre going turn back pivot Zoom appease bar-goers ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù snobs refuse adapt. mention elderly underlying health problems impacted straining health infrastructure. Someone take child/Ren dr/hospital, upping chances passing on/ getting it...ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Oh poor thing...who hurt you? swear, alive right diagnosis slowly die stress... Honestly let one. It‚Äôs greater good Disney? Universal? Beaches? visit grandma? daily ICU death numbers r/capitalism_in_decay  Yeah typing whole post deleting instead posting regular thing cases go markets rally, way around. think vaccine explain public well tested was, safe is, etc. we‚Äôll reach 70% public taking it. Right it‚Äôs mystery allow couples tested negative travel? go everyone? matter they're positive tested? Betsy Devoss absolute worst. cannot answer single question asked interview punts accountability local school districts. one people loves title takes keep it. needs gone, simple that. disaster education system. Republicans Congress blood hands, refusing help states budgets appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Poor kids. Even virus may kill children high rates, may cause lasting debilitating effects.

We need know virus even consider reopening schools. I'm scared August/September. website sell masks cartoon mouths noses! preordered thinking quality would decent- huge disney fan family members anything they've gotten, anything bought trips, always good quality. NOPE. reviews like 1.5 ‚òÜ people receiving them. cut correctly. also changed website information masks never updated anyone. allow cancel orders. MAD. closer person next me, likely air exhale hits recirculated. 
I don‚Äôt risk potentially sick stranger sitting right next several consecutive hours shops visit may happen anyone one airlines don‚Äôt middle seats open. live state making people quarantine visit Florida? so, goes back work contact local health department say Florida quarantined 14 days. Also people get sick work also file claim OSHA. Jacksonville still go ?  wanted Epcot Center epicenter  lol fuck else nba supposed do, stop playing season two lose billions dollars would cancel next season maybe next two due players owners renegotiate new cba? fuck dude wanna watch basketball dont give fuck ethics ... virus mask ‚Äî instead person‚Äôs face inside mouth, nose, lungs.

**Because** mask.

And he‚Äôs worried touching mask picking nose going lead **more** infections?

How make even slightest bit sense? Fuuuuuck you. read herd immunity Wikipedia makes expert. That's describe it. HUGE hope pandemics? Queensland University project want research line. fingers crossed - success hopefully stop pandemic gets going. Pretty sure he's incapable level self reflection. cases, forget cases. daily cases Italy could ever hope have. beach Florida even enjoyable summer though. There's beaches NY. February Let‚Äôs call one. Instead let‚Äôs make Champion masks.

Please?

For greater good? Dem-controlled states generally handling virus much better though, rather midst snowballing pandemic like Republican states? also stop masks vanishing stock hospitals could actually stock. still lack trumps dumbfucj pay-to-play justice system would let ton people get away slap wrist though.

Significant fines least good deterrent poor middle class population. rich get away whatever want. :( China months. WTF know? /s exactly prepare hospital shutting chemo? realized obesity increases risk complications, right? makes okay die though. 15K daily cases reported 1% non-residents. chunk 99% Florida Man stage evolution. 

But agree DeSantis, 100%. everyone else yeah, bad belgium. Reporting suspected cases too. /s NC. woman wife knows husband get sick fever forth, clearly covid. Three days fever started hospital three days dead. Since died bother finish test. pre-existing conditions chronic illness 50's. shit literally nightmare fuel everyone acting like big deal. unsafe. It‚Äôs also unsafe without air conditioning temperatures 100 degrees. fact people risk dying coronavirus (elderly, pre-existing conditions) also risk dying heat stroke. cooling centers even come risk. Good time quit probably half damned job economy has.

Being forced work conditions matter job huge red flag. I‚Äôm sorry fellow Texans, tried can‚Äôt beat Florida. /s hope brought assault charges. Found KKK racist! DING DING DING! pleased point, wanna say. Fuck guy people like him. Remember 10,000 cases day record ~~Pepperidge Farms~~ voters remember. America stuck hands death cult right now. literally one psychotic things I've ever seen life. wake every day like cold-sweats unnerving. one flat? mean ""ARIZONIANS"" freak. Part reason testing historical use. Another reason used greater access quality information would allow people make informed decisions policies support, I'm pretty sure that's basically non-existent days.

The main reason, however, can't manage can't measure. Maybe Florida run morons. Maybe White House totally vacant. Still, people FEMA, CDC, staffing hospitals, researching spread mechanics, etc. would benefit data.

We still understand pretty fundamental things disease, important gather whatever data regardless politicians do.

Just look: Trump finally put damn mask on. happened without pretty clear data showing 1) still problem 2) wearing mask affords protection person wearing it. That's proof even vacuous, self-indulgent, illiterate fool totally unaffected data. also classic pimp situations, since prostitution legal lot social organizations help getting that. working girls self employed use business models like described . Completely different forced prostitution mostly foreign girls, drug prostitution brothels Flatrate, pay prostitutes set wage. implying Trump followers retarded detached reality snowflakes need pampered? 

How dare you! Treat like human beings. deserve right wrong. issue point kinda ""have"" start that. Obviously mean within reason -- attending hosting party people still wildly irresponsible risky thing do. inviting friend two dinner drinks necessary risk lot people rn, included. opinion pretty low risk parties smart safe.

At point people need get homes see friends family. think majority humans realistically isolate relegate social interactions internet months time. Especially social people live alone are/have responsible.

Not accusing obviously, lot introverted redditors sub miss component. India's curve Worldometers alarming. looks like exponential increase doubling time around 3 weeks. time things appear slow couple days, offering faint hope things may stabilize, new record set. can't even foresee plateau might be. India four times population US. Even current death toll 23,000 17 per million, less 5% US per capita. India reach horrific number deaths without even breaking sweat. agree, need him. slow aspects, unfortunately that‚Äôs probably administration works in.
I hope things change Singapore quite competent (but still well bottom half SE Asia - Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia Myanmar done lot better) dealing COVID 0.05% number needs put context. vast majority cases among low end foreign workers housed ghetto-like dormitories young healthy. mostly involved construction, cleaning jobs locals allowed enter country start work without proper health checks eliminate serious health conditions. also almost 50 years old. also similar situation Qatar mortality rate also low. 

With normal population profile, death rate would 0.05% even Singapore know health system top notch lived decade before. Welcome Epcot Epicenter visit hotspots around world. hope What's stunning think consistently choose wrong choice, inevitably unerringly always chooses wrong thing. exactly mean? knew back human human infection possible? ELI5 I'm saying CA stumbled late.

But Arizona clearly worse shape (per capita). disagree? Sounds like great time re-open schools! /s Personal question. sister showing symptoms quite sick. mom spent whole night last night taking care her. mom risk (high blood pressure, smoker, etc.) Im pretty worried now, mom gets shes done. anybody please give advice go done ensure mom stays safe contract it. Thank you. fuck arrive conclusion? main demo Arizona Native Americans? really know ""they"" case morons citizens Arizona, seeing rona care race are, neither lol think facts settled later, followers take lead start wearing masks might actually time reduce upcoming deaths ""Pretty please risk life health stock tank. Thanks much."" it, though? Stubborn people wearing masks got bad first place. absolutely zero forgiveness left gullible morons. Part hoped Trump would stick guns. Maybe goes like soccer season Europe: spectators, tests game, teams isolation, team gets positive cases play two weeks. Ahh reddit. epitome ‚Äúunoriginal edgy teenagers think they‚Äôre original‚Äù. super famous family India. father one successful stars ever. son alright, daughter law probably top 3 Bollywood actresses time.

Non-essential travel banned though. countries policy highly discouraged traveling towns/cities anything work. But.

NY IIRC think post megathread. parents want schools open daycare purposes, kids summer they‚Äôre work?‚Äù

A lot families know use summer camps. many day camps exist fit need (Many educational. sports themed. Others fun.)

In area (South Carolina) many close. many parents want schools open five days week (mostly need work) often point *daycares summer camps close one got sick, schools need open full time!!*  need logic environmental workplace injury long term.

Oh lung cancer 20 years asbestos removal also smoked young? Well well nobody knows they! Barack years, things definitely took turn. republican presidencies, growing apprehensions towards white conservative types, whereas groups Asians States always seen better people western nations fawned result. seeing slow death American Empire. smaller less power America bring better world. hear man. got bunch people life hook, line sinker dude. like said, conned. 

The thing Trump really good marketing selling. mean, buy shit him. sell rubes. that, he's completely useless. getting kind redundant. Every day going biggest one day increase. Let's see pleased is, little tommy ICU 2 weeks going Disneyworld tearfully mommy Good Morning America.

Mommy: never would gone think safe. Disney people told safe, governor told safe,......waaaaaaaahhhhhhhh maaaaaaah pooor little tommy, full life..........baaaaaawwwwwwllllllllll

Great PR move!  Yup, us ‚Äúextras‚Äù like uploading read aloud videos risk disciplinary action districts. America #1!! Yeah, kind plan could followed. someone seen something like coming. Sad every person, every age going something related this. Chin &amp; life gets much harder consider practice mental reserve &amp; tenacity!!! Nowhere say wearing mask. wore mask everyone else wore mask doubt would spread 71 people. Eh that‚Äôs supply demand thing. Wearing mask selfless act protect people may never meet know. folks don‚Äôt wear mask simply say right wear one wearing one infringes freedom. selfish mindset feel logic seen folks political ideology topics. Fuck. silencing? eliminating? like I'm advocating driving cars protestors. 

I'm fiscal conservative, I'm pro 2a. could never support candidate like Trump support kids cages, sex trafficking, etc. supporters fascists deserve whatever brings demise. Right, that‚Äôs deleted first comment said damage permanent. smokers fully damaged lungs (9 months) much higher risk diseases. Calling it. comes. next days: ""I'm taking incredibly seriously. seriously Fauci told wear masks! I'm wearing them! Fauci done none would ever happened that's I'm calling resignation gross incompetence. I'm gonna say 'Yer Fired!'"" Literally right watched YouTube video general saying this. ridiculous... real?

NY \~800 new cases yesterday. Florida 15k new cases. That's NY ***ever had*** one day entirety pandemic. NY record 12k, lockdowns. Florida ***still not*** locked extent! record numbers happened NY two weeks lockdown FL still locked even beating records, math. you! Relax dude‚Äî missed sarcasm flare New cases important metric percentage turn hospitalizations deaths. new cases, hospitalizations deaths. Yup greed selfishness America finally showing true colors. Honestly think start end country. matter time countries want nothing us. guys could build wall we'd appreciate Canadian border. Trump pay it. Good point. Would make surreal flight everyone wearing respirator masks. Good burn. check well cleaned plate ate perfectly clean wrinkled tissues behind head. least he's stylish phone, tablet laptop time. think anyone arguing this

They absolutely are. plenty people believe research center Wuhan actually bioweapons engineering location coronavirus purposefully created rather accidental cross-contamination. Teachers town asked choose whether want online teacher coming school year want hybrid online, person teacher. online-only teachers assigned teach kid - chosen online-only instruction him.  April 10th: Fauci lie: ""We'll top-out around 60,000 deaths total entire thing.""

We 400,000 active cases then.A blind howler monkey could seen, knew happened China, would far that. 


Lie: went say we'd top-out around 120,000 deaths total. 


Fraud. like AIDS crisis. definitely agree. tests shit though takes weeks get result. People isolating tested can't afford they're selfish so, get positive test back already went infected tens people. vicious cycle Gta hate third world countries rip populations.. oh wait that's America days. Good job guys! make people support mask wearing look bad. Economic? don‚Äôt agree priority reasonable point view look at. 

Re-election? shouldn‚Äôt priority bet it‚Äôs point view WH looks really strongly

Edit: love downvotes even suggesting it‚Äôs possible people (which don‚Äôt even include me) could different priority yourself. ever came mind gets called racist xenophobic he's indeed exactly that? That‚Äôs even close ‚Äúupdate wills.‚Äù Don‚Äôt know understand concept, testing means cases. isn‚Äôt ‚Äútrumps idiot!!!‚Äù Thing. It‚Äôs true. test WAY country. Using positive cases argument ignorant. mean NHL build outdoor ice rink like 2 weeks Dwayne Johnson haul huge ass gym every movie shoot does, see impossible put together handful regulation courts practice facilities given time they've had. know votes we're seeing long term effects across board levels covid severity. Granted long term effects nasty, still effects non-the-less. Politicians still gerrymander districts suit needs, however. electoral system broken ground-up. Texas, several friends family move *deep* South. in, tiny little towns even gas station *deep*.

Without fail, every single one gotten angrier violent political discourse. Like you, also see/hear lot making declarations wanting murder/mutilate/rape/assault people Nancy Pelosi, AOC, Joe Biden.

Most people fairly normal left. understand it. Well done, floridians. Good job. another rally, please. Invite cadet bone spurs. Californian here. Santa Barbara County facing wait times appointments two weeks test results take week. 

I‚Äôm saying we‚Äôre realm Florida, we‚Äôre ‚Äúall bag chips‚Äù. 

Our governor also [gave $1 BN contract ‚Äúhidden‚Äù performance standards $495 MM prepayment. mask $3.30 contract, astonishing we‚Äôre looking contract millions units. [two months behind wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs ‚Äúpay play‚Äù, Newsom‚Äôs campaign received donations BYD.

Edit add: Looks like Newsom told Assembly $1.4 BN won‚Äôt enough we‚Äôll need billions PPE. Meanwhile, there‚Äôs [PPE maker America (albeit Texas, barely America) line that‚Äôs sitting idle lack commitment governmental agencies. I‚Äôve seen movie... Resident Russia Lab leaks conspiracy? Bio weapons lie? Strange. think ""fumble"" right word. think ""own goal"", closer. clear current administration done everything power make epidemic worse, kill many people possible. charitable, might trying minimize political costs, ignorant human medical costs. effect same. It‚Äôs extremely silly hill try die on. I‚Äôm waiting COVID pant dance next. great wars left fight simpletons decided going theirs. üòÇ Well, UK phase 3 already shown 6 6 monkeys got infected despite vaccination don‚Äôt hope much. president. vote House Montana worth 3/4 Californian's. vote senator worth 20x Californian's. whole system silly. Almost 45 percent deaths comes Capital city. Sweden great Stockholm stats would pretty low really don‚Äôt know enough say involved newsom trump jr butthead seems strange leap. Newsom dashing n seems sane whereas jr known racist lion poaching treasonous bit filth.. hope keep
Partying hamptons without masks tbh .. think ‚Äòelites‚Äô get better it‚Äôs way they‚Äôll ever feel
The humility reality needed change.  hate phrase underestimates *both* diseases. Covid much worse (seasonal) flu *and* flu serious illness well.  Need details. Fake news. hoax. flu bro. Arrest bill gates, 5g towers! News flash: Everybody dies. yeah, actually public?

(i mean ""open face"" characters)?

because Jack Sparrow w/o mask would city rules.. maybe Disney even put ones out.. ""second floor"".. selfies. ...dude that‚Äôs past 3-4 days. Yesterday terrible dream thought maybe dreams wasn‚Äôt remembering. say nightmares? choice suspect. 145,000 tests I‚Äôm seeing everywhere. Oof, bad typo half Americans fuked then. Right? counter argument this. Americans obese. Yes coronavirus suddenly contagious enough march. 

Hmmm weird entire world deal completely separate coronavirus wore masks entire time? 

So weird South Korea Taiwan masks implemented since day 1 look doing. 


So weird using masks respiratory illness... incredibly fucking weird huh? Don‚Äôt forget lot people want armed security guards. nah ""hush"" stupid troll. expectations low article well sourced. Believe want. I'm trying change mind. That's need centrally controlled quarantine home quarantine. incident one examples taught China lesson.

Nevertheless need lose hope. Although superspreader event nearly cause entire city Harbin (capital Heilongjiang, population million) lockdown, end suppressed district level closed management citywide lockdown. STI sounds harder certain ways. easier know sex people kinda awkward revealing info ......... hate humans. DoD policy months mask must worn times US military installations may conceivably within 6 feet another person. enforcing everyone too, active duty. Retirees can't set foot commissarry without mask face. Woah really sad post history. sound like horrible awful person. hope get help  That's exactly we're doing, we're minority. Last time public grocery shopping March 16th. Since then, we've ordering Amazon Fresh. Sure, miss typical brands food sometimes hard find certain things but, i'll fucking take it. can't find work home, mom's business still closed still paying $2,000 month rent space. 

It's honestly pretty bad us here. worry though, others, boating days Disney World! tested positive Florida today, I‚Äôm one 15,000! üò©  Bob Iger leading ‚ÄúI‚Äôm loved great‚Äù charge socially responsible?! Can‚Äôt, gotta pump profits! Whoa whoa whoa 70k cases deaths. Hahah New Zealand called racist xenophobic. president it, they'd call every name book, done anyway. Yes. Exactly.

When declare things facts they're not, also erodes public trust. know what? would wear mask thinking viral loads intubation. could potentially save you, loved ones , stress, pain, inconvenience watching and|or enduring horrific uffering expense truly nasty sickness. 

Not everyone‚Äôs immune system same, different ages test results apply everyone. 

I say put inconvenience potentially enjoy many good years without Covid side effects ever long time. Oh lol

I unfortunately unaware reference didn‚Äôt know asshole liking basketball ..and article didnt mention all. picture would seem perfectly healthy 29 year old died due virus, simply case want get lot unmasked idiots country want give me...  I‚Äôm direct hospital employee, even they‚Äôre sporadically never testing employees facilities south Florida. support trauma surgeries transport donor tissue. don‚Äôt even qualify first responder. It‚Äôs funny honestly terms crowdedness tight closed spaces skyscrapers population density, NYC seen massive spikes protests. never happened. that's mask discipline. us will, clearly us look back all. think point matter time see stories superspreader events Disney, guests contracting virus Disney dying, PR nightmares. Disney could give shit many people die altar Mouse keep profits flowing, *do* care bad PR. course, fact they've rushed headlong reopening suggests they've probably already done math figured they'll still come ahead. usually do. Tampa resident well. I‚Äôm genuinely scared things heading. Stay safe neighbor. takes takes time die this.. hard comprehend?

They averaged ~35 deaths/day 5/15-7/1, adding ~1000 cases/day near beginning say 6/15. seeing deaths creep spike infections began, 3 weeks seems entirely reasonable.

If CFR around 3.5% holds, they‚Äôre terrible summer. 15k confirmed today, won‚Äôt even hear 500 people die new infections week early August. 

That CFR might bit lower since they‚Äôre testing average age infection going down, even 2% (meaning miss half cases mortality 1%) still looking 300 deaths today alone nearly 1100 previous 7 days. High low risk death worth it. hospitalisations understand it.

Does guy read actual news listen Alex Jones? ICUs many regions Texas full, handful beds available. Texas Medical Center filled baseline ICU beds surge capacity. Hospitals turning people away emergency rooms nowhere put new patients one care them.

My apologies Ireland take ignorant citizens. joke referring Chernobyl. Christianity. No, seriously. lot tied directly young-earth anti-science christian fundamentalists (evangelical christians) seem out-sized influence republican party. 

* Climate change? way, impossible earth 4000 years old. 
* Stem cell research? uses aborted fetus cells can't condone that. 
* Evolution? could happen 4000 years? 
* Creationism instead science school classes? I'm sorry, separation church state again?

It's major fucking problem. underlines major distrust science many Americans directly contributed 100,000+ dead Americans. think under-express furious whole thing made me. could use federal funds hire teachers decrease class sizes enable social distancing, convert community buildings schools (enable social distancing), retro-fit school ventilation systems, something control pandemic dangerous. 

I could think dozens ideas federal government could make schools safer send everyone back school now, changes schools usually operate, change pandemic case numbers. Scientist works COVID (and cells) here. important. Loss antibodies mean complete loss immunity. means antibody levels dropped threshold detection ELISA assay, expect antibodies diseases.

A realistic scenario antibodies drop threshold, possibly quickly light infections, probably sort immune response generated reactive memory cells well memory B cells quickly ramp production upon re-exposure SARS-CoV-2.

So, much like swine flu, previous flu epidemic conferred immunity older generations, keep level resistance time. would look like? Hard say, especially given COVID tends manifest worst symptoms due overly enthusiastic immune response late stages people can't manage reign early on. However, I'd guess good news. Probably means reinfection sort possible, might look like mild cold even vulnerable. Maybe shorter. Maybe less contagious. small fraction people, maybe bad, depending immune response, I'd guess tiny minority.

The implications huge here. may mean number infected (or effectively immune) far higher counted even antibody assays. However, may also totally inconsequential fluke derived lab assay used test this. Certainly points away idea lifelong immunity. COVID-19 going us long time. However, equilibrates seasonal pattern 2-3 years, would likely end massive restrictions now. like vaccine would mean indefinite shutdown, likely restrictions nursing homes hospitals long time. I'd expect doctors working least surgical masks quite while. science points COVID stay. Also remember much science much worked out. public really used seeing data raw, wait someone like Fauci re-iterate specific point confidence go particular path. want give health insurance. lose job then, its.. oh woe  discrediting him. setting scapegoat next surge whatever else happens leading election. certainly wasn‚Äôt Harvey. Houstonian could tell that. positive attempts trying contain COVID credited Linda Hidalgo, county judge, who‚Äôs way city lately. every hospital actually overrun? dont think even close we? Let preface saying Disney wrong reopen Disneyworld right now. 100% agree. 

But I've little confused getting much shit Universal, Sea World, Bush Gardens, Six Flags, etc open while. 

Disney wrong open, best - closed sooner, opened later, better protocols, etc...and get heat, still. could seriously see Fauci grab Cuomo running mate; hop 60 minutes announce running pres... win. think US public would rather Fauci/Cuomo options. 

Current pres approval = 37%

Fauci Approval = 72% last saw. sure? LA County COVID19 website contradicts statement. day testing available, next day testing currently available Bellflower Monterey Forum Inglewood testing site closest showing available appointments couple days now. Screenshot below. (Recent, taken time comment sustainable, especially pending eviction crisis. Hospitals *never* see recoup money keep billing people. many cases people charged north thousand dollars covid test United States auspices ""free"". common all, medical insurance loopholes hospitals/test facilities use people get profit. kissing trump's ass downplaying virus much possible point.

You don‚Äôt need lot dishes, one mug, 3 glasses, 3 bowls, plate, 1 set silverware, 2 knives, 2 cutting boards, big spoon, spatula, strainer, measuring cups/spoons, big frying pan, little frying pan, big pot little pot. put hooks wall hang pots cooking utensils mug save cupboard space. also hang EVERYTHING walls, clothes, scissors, headphones, reusable grocery bag, purse, sunglasses, masks, hole punch, notebooks, hung walls.

any questions? It‚Äôll even less test results lagging 7 10 days deaths keep coming interim  see lot old people lot fat people, don‚Äôt see lot old fat people. Dang, hope feel better soon! know got it? Good catch Armenia. I‚Äôll change that. Today's good day learn something new yourself. open Disney. Lmao. Florida joke new York times page tracking Bro nations top doctor CDC lied american public wearing masks respiratory illness pandemic cool it. 

I hope primary doctor follows Fauci's lead lies mom cancer treatment, lies son asthma, lies lupus lies ever get coronavirus. 

Don't put shit others ready deal yourself. I've saying month friends family. summer going blood bath.  Source? forgot part people wanted teachers armed stop school shootings also. may lying numbers they've given. journalist given ""900 total cases..."" that's report. things OK everyone wore mask?

&amp;#x200B;

Or place going full anti-mask Karens infected Covid? New York City densest city America higher population european countries.

NYC deaths cases Wuhan that's stupidly unacceptable.

Don't mistake low standards objective truth. lost war. Fuck. results 9 day time delay... proud call NY home. Despite obvious issues challenges early NY rose it
And isn‚Äôt politics leadership whatever
It‚Äôs people respected weight situation despite desire give kept it
Work home
Wear masks
Keep distance
Patience...

It maybe get worse gets better patience key. shorten much time ‚Äúworse‚Äù period Yeah got it. Thanks much. Hope news outlets pick up, state pro-schools it‚Äôs disgusting. Nobody values teachers‚Äô lives around here.  Let's stop pretending simple issue. millions parents work essential jobs (hospital workers, food production, etc) society need working. millions might work essential jobs, still need provide families. everyone lucky enough job work home.

Like millions parents depend upon schools educate children also provide childcare work. parents supposed schools open? viable alternative?

This virus going around long time. Best case get vaccine early 2021 - assuming effective one found. meantime? government can't afford pay everyone stay home even could survive one going work (we can't). simple phrase ""tax rich"" work - putting everthing else aside simply enough rich people make work. far federal government spent 4 TRILLION dollars this. annual federal budget (all money given social security benefits, welfare, defense spending, Medicare spending, NASA, education, etc). Double everyone's taxes (rich, poor, middle - class, businesses) come enough pay already spent!

We middle pandemic. possible make things safe. best make safe possible. sucks. want protect everyone - especially children. federal government straight people. going open schools completely safe, to. focus needs make safe possible.

The goal reduce number social interactions. online options use it. 20 kids class, 5 able go online - 20 (and families) safer. Check temperatures entering buildings. Encourage parents others work allow family members friends let kids online school house. Think reduce class sizes. libraries government buildings empty right - small class sizes there? millions people work right - guess good many would able supervise /assist kids online classes.

EDIT - ask wish vote please leave comment saying why. know lost that's actually funnier (kinda), makes think.. Well, I've taught HS students March June part shit show.

Students different internet technology abilities, many intrinsically motivated, childcare responsibilities parents could work, everything asynchronous means podcasts, videos etc. 

All classes project based rely equipment there, robotics robots, science labs etc.

Those classes aligned 'book learning' fair much better work handed in, late, misunderstood, students missing zooms etc. Limited consequences enforce 'you get zero this' since also students fault they're suddenly home. 

It's going work like college expectation 'adult' paying education better get together. 

That's even starting formative early grades, nightmare getting 6 year old shit kindergarten. read, write, count, basic math etc. concerned he's kid learns best groups many age. Let alone social skill development. 

Most parents I've talked experience. 

I teach online, adapt best behind whole year maybe bit much, students 100% make good progress.

We're probably going hybrid 2 3 model theory home /online school stuff non replicatable things find fair. long involves masks class size limitations. state bad cases, may thing differently Florida. Even hopeless, masks closures still slow new infections keep many hospital beds available possible.

Also, true, props contact tracers able figure out. Hopefully least able mitigate infections stemming cluster Lol üòÇ see Jefferson flags bumper stickers ever California Arizona less populous state Florida matter, supporters abandoning he's mask slave, rather admitting wrong. really like masks New York statewide shutdown 7000 cases 50 deaths *in total*. it, want go NY did... sure testing, means able make smarter decisions (and also Cuomo isnt blame, flying blind still took decisive action seeing states today).

NY feels immensely better, still significantly higher new cases per million places europe reopened (and seem okay far). Really wish could another 3wks hard lockdown actually nip back meaningful reopen, guess pointless since dragged states' recklessness regardless. 

Such national failure.

edit: many contact tracers florida have? many take handle 15,000 new cases day?

edit2: per below, apparently best 2,300 tracers FL... jesus christ. NY state infected wear mask, mask protect wearer (much), protects wearer. protect neee respirator N95 better. 80 deaths 8000. bad remember looking again. scanned article given trump leaked 2005 read more. 

Let's see last 7 years let Mueller go back work follow money outside scope investigation. He's asking bare minimum governor let him.  lol.  140k dead already...

so dumb. Here's deal; people like Fauci unless told highness.

Some people like way Fauci handled masks early on; people still like him. seen one ""misstep"".

Those dislike one, focus one thing... cause feel much material. Masks help, enough? need lockdown, least semi lockdown.  upvoted, it‚Äôs nice keep folks informed help others out. Coverings work except wasn‚Äôt cities March. 

Asking people North Dakota wear masks March would make difference. 

Lockdowns cities started early ended early didn‚Äôt implement masks right time.

Does America apply LA NYC FL? think Florida's new strategy let everyone get Covid, everyone antibody. even need vaccine anymore point. Guys 50 IQ play, 200 IQ play. need sorry. That's 100% true. states teachers clear less 32k taxes. messed up. suppose that‚Äôs probably true. equate folks believe plandemic video. think 95% want lab looked would argue accidental release zoonotic virus (possibly tampered surveillance public health purposes).

No one wanted this. US forces: carrying Corona virus around world. Yay! We're thinking next fiscal quarter further, guess. Dr Rick Bright nothing changed. needs start war distraction effect. every single one gotten angrier violent political discourse. 

Yeah, cut family friends that. really believe need anti-psychotics point. can't talk politics without screaming threatening violence. making declarations wanting murder/mutilate/rape/assault people 

I see shit time. Absolutely worst , complete moron. I‚Äôm sure first comment went, doesn‚Äôt seem way North Florida. Unless people completely disregarding they‚Äôre supposed doing, wouldn‚Äôt surprise me, unfortunately. u/chrismittty Also: PUBLIC HEALTH ECONOMY ANYTHING *BUT* SEPARATE RIGHT NOW.

Like, government ignore virus wants name ""duh ee-con-oh-mee"". change fact millions people going refuse buy anything food necessities they're shit-scared catching/spreading virus. say adopt, mean adopt stance of.

Anyway, 

 peer-reviewed duplicated research **SARS-2** ‚Äî published late March/early April ‚Äî showed SARS2 coronavirus could spread asymptomatically.

We rule Israel two people elevator one time. obviously wear mask ($125 fine otherwise) Sadly 100% truth. think goes even that. Negligence understatement. God bless teacher's, health care professionals, worker's people world. Sometimes think bad dream, I'll wake over, never happens gets worse day. Orange face need's removed office stat. Someone needs take reins, we're deep deep trouble. excessive well today Sunday expect death lags since deaths often quite low sundays. also bear mind deaths we're seeing got infected say weeks ago now. would better look 7 day average cases say 2-4 weeks ago Florida. deaths 15k cases become apparent end month early August. Covid patients die within days take weeks

Also depends age getting infected. younger people getting infected death rate high whereas elderly getting infected expect horrific death toll lot comments seem miss overwhelming majority Americans overweight obese. 2030, projected MORBIDLY obese #1 weight category. We're coming point fit makes unicorn. think saw counties, 30% tested positive vs nyc 3%. great news.  How? logical conclusion.

You replied comment cited two (...) **largest increases** number COVID-19 cases (...) home large numbers **minorities**

And **growing fastest** counties large **communities color**

And reply statistics **they** care.

When posted comment sure refering to.

It either colored community, since preventing spread disease people said community: wWearing masks, avoiding crowds, disinfecting door handles, tables seats, providing elderly, etc.

Or, ""they"" might refer establishment, white people, man behind curtain, Soros jews regular, lizardpeople, whatever.

The third possibility lame excuse, meant people Arizona, admit color nothing it, even admit peope Arizona know that, makes sense include here.

As see, blaming colored community makes sense, possibilites make sense.

So proven either racist moron :) video going one case studies professors business schools 20 years future assign example bad marketing.  mention lots people died preventable non-covid health problems hospitals overwhelmed, covid-19. nah... historically essential business ;) Suspicious Disney branded version virus called DisMag-2020. shape Mickey Mouse's head get 5% next purchase tickets $5 Disney park Florida. Literally *no one* knows actual number. 

Apart efforts mischaracterise deaths might happening various places control optics, truth never final figure years later pandemic, consistent fact know going *higher* current figures, usually large margin. trump banned china travel, Democrats called literally hitler laughed notion. Now, benefit hindsight, demanding stop air travel period. 

Yes, whole country punted initial virus response. pretty well established point. Nobody disagreeing that. fact. yes, non-essential(using actual definition essential) air travel US stopped time york huge international airport. states international airports too. Atlanta, LA, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, international, busier JFK

Ok, none cities(minus LA) well known tourist spots NYC is. None cities density issues NYC has. Atlanta, Dallas, LA really winter deal like NYC does, meaning indoor gatherings easier way virus spread. 

This brings back ending point/question prior comment. people feel need disregard, go even far trash, positive actions US leaders put position put first place? federal government telling states handle COVID already started spreading, time preparation, PPE gathering, etc, workplace equivalent boss telling time project, give you. tell due last week, started yet, help all. Dude love brunch also want world open wait order in. apparently can't going extend everyone matter Trump willing let us die anyways? Reading comments like go along lines ‚Äúwe research don‚Äôt blindly follow orders‚Äù would funny serious. type people Bill Burr makes fun podcast always thought exaggerated comedy purposes. even delayed testing. they‚Äôve sick 1-2 weeks you‚Äôre list people trace massive.

Fucking christ, I'm one deciding conditions lead greater risk Nah give much credit. asks himself, who's talking right saying? virus another thing causes bad people say bad things him. difference time tweeting ""white power"" make crisis go away like every political crisis last 4 years. response nothing click bait. extremely unhealthy... got sick... died. thing 18y old 'completely healthy boy' died per news. diabetes... healthy. trifecta health problems. actual article (from 2015) look history phylogeny virus. 

First recognized DNA SARS (human corona) 2008, similar Bat corona virus SHC014-CoV. 

They took bat corona brand altered infect mouse order study basic effects immune response. Mouse models regularly used research. model learned spike protein key. spike 14 points bind ACE receptors. 7 points varied bat human viruses. 5 important actual binding. 

So took SARS-CoV backbone inserted whole Bat corona virus spike. used mouse models study immune responses try find vaccine. 

This seemed work. got lot antibodies. worked much better predicted model. figured spike important infection. tested human cells see could cross species did. worked humans civets (weasel family). 

So, yes. human interference altering virus backbone spike combinations. 

However, SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) come this. Covid 88% bat-SL-CoVZC45. different strain. spike uniquely placed. notable tags DNA sequence like CRISPR, editing tool, would use. Read this: can‚Äôt believe r actually even considering this.

/s They‚Äôve pre-produced some, nowhere near enough vaccinate whole UK. Iirc aiming 2 million doses time supposed approval thing Group Testing depends grouping, risk false negatives go route non-adaptive group testing mom unemployed shit get real stop $600 checks 2 weeks. mom owns store within gym gym technically open, we've heard people going gym even though kids covid i'm practically begging mom go back yet. i'm plain old unemployed lol working family decided keep right cut everyone else loose. 

What do? personal, suggestions wfh jobs? Yeah thinking too. Like, Sunday usually day numbers lowest, yet records set lot places. Yeah, may backlog, still high numbers backlogs + delays testing also exist time being.

As now, we're 48,000 cases U.S (Worldometer says 52,000 though), that's still numbers California continuing come well 15-20 states reporting yet. May surpass 60,000 end today. asked immunity denier was, think person answered question you. people suggesting evidence immunity virus. Think meant ventilators Absolutely agreed. run numbers see what's going on. I've actually heard excuses people take seriously princess though. cross-dressing badass. I'm curious well Cuomo happened, that's what. Sure best governor way handling pandemic amazing. pushed social distancing wearing masks, also fear monger gave facts NY needed get numbers down. Please follow rules human communication stop passing nonsense make head information. Better thought fool open mouth remove doubt. turkey asymptomatic carriers? going anything incredibly negative effect. Take away thing people use escape mass anger.

Edit: word friend nurse Palm Beach county says ICU overrun, she‚Äôs assigned 5-6 patients night tripling patients rooms. Patients mid50s + literally plague, yes Yes, alcohol withdrawal patients often need ICU beds normal ones, even would less them, could much worse healthcare system Yep, crickets. Crickets lucky. please follow rules sub civil stay home blankets rest life since you‚Äôre terrified outside world. let rest us live lives.

P.S. vaccine end year. That‚Äôs thing: lot cancer patients, can‚Äôt just, ‚Äútake break,‚Äù treatment. Postponing cancer treatment even couple weeks hospitals overflowing difference life death. Even matter days make difference cancer treatments. 

There many unseen victims pandemic. UK pretty bad March, still (albeit lighter) lockdown 4 months later.

Only feel safer venture out. Scotland means wearing mask shops public transport. Right........

I hear answer one........ No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, means mean that. Like dad survived double cancer 40 years smoking...I tell weekly matter go out. risk. large chunk country though. hope people research go click bait society today. stop terrible messaging understand cases underlying conditions. fall category probably need take extra precaution. thing using support dumb fucking narrative using hyperbole. obviously thing gives better chance set preparations give best chances. contract virus, cannot die it, simple enough understand?. Preparing avoid catching virus whole best option have, especially people absolutely nothing underlying health problems. focusing health means absolutely fucking shit unless mask, social distance, avoid non essential activities quarantine. jump crowd 100 people without mask, blood pressure going stop contracting virus. People good/great physical health zero health conditions died virus. pro-mask messaging, people tend forget masks stop epidemic. gonna happen elections too. They're gonna ""lose"" votes. think misunderstood saying. i'm saying heat kill virus Lol, know you‚Äôre facetious, it‚Äôs lot that. US spent coronavirus four years worth defense budget. live current hotspots like Texas / Florida people still walking around without masks? There's reason believe vaccine literally impossible antibodies stick around long infection idiot making claims like this, utterly irresponsible. wildly variable thing. people couple symptoms. depends organs/system latches onto. Like big percentage country has. heard first time. agree you. fairly stable virus genetically too. suspect currently seeing continue get know, right? keep thinking line Contagion: one know there's problem everyone knows there's problem (to prevent panic). 

I'm half expecting ppl learn eventually a) asymptomatic cases actually pre-symptomatic mostly b) true closed case mortality much higher previously reported (on long enough timeline...)

Like words true picture bad emerge huge number people it, late, even behavioral changes like masks distancing can't save us Hm... Fuck. Whoever wrote tweet sounds oddly excited seminar I've gotten story ulcerative colitis train marathon anti-science party take stand everything. people don‚Äôt acknowledge global warming evolution experts kind.

They‚Äôve successfully turned science belief simply deny wholesale. Take advantage indeed. heard. people intentionally added party one person positive covid . still, many compared now.
I‚Äôd argue ever infected traveling various international airports, makes somehow setting within hours exposure extremely unlikely. many, positive test result hand stay home, get fired. Let's start there.  Wait, wouldn‚Äôt fill hospital beds long time alcoholics get delirium quitting cold turkey? patient often need beds, ICU ones... Coronavirus absolutely low CFR young people country. data there, it‚Äôs well established. Look New York. There‚Äôs need say things like ‚Äúnot likely country‚Äù data. Arizona 110 degrees right getting butt fucked. logic denied. Ah, got it. Thank Yea fuck that. dying nothing. It‚Äôs furthering research cure helping anyone. It‚Äôs sadly sacrificing purely political means. horrible tragedy keeps getting worse. idiots violently resist people get hurt killed, cause idiots riot. Pick poison. stage I'm cheering virus. daughter blew fluffy dead dandy lion made wish, asked wished said big germ go away. Also importantly, matter people dying COVID specifically? excess deaths year, beyond reasonable margin fluctuation, reasonably blamed pandemic poor handling pandemic opinion. Fun fact. USSR completely evacuated area around nuclear power plant built new city everybody evacutaed.

In US get told victims fault disaster happens deal it. Big shout Disney Corporation forcing employees go back work absolutely unsafe conditions. many dead employees churro money worth, rat fucks? remember period time quite well. good information yet serious long term many symptoms could even younger cases. thought rapidly fatal pneumonia really bad among elderly. know there's kind clotting organ damage involved.

Not excuse him, also bet hammering behind stage crashing markets.  true... also: thing yet. Yesterday 188 new cases corona Italy according worldmetre vs 15000 Florida. Italy hell, luckily seem better place. hope I'm wrong, statistics tell tale certain percentage dying many Florida? hope best, really believe happen. live NYC. could probably ask done stop virus.

Everyone wear masks indoors.

People keeping distance outdoors.

You step literally urgent care neighborhood get free COVID test (takes 15 minutes results come within 2 days)

Anyone work home still working home.

Schools closed since mid-march.

No indoor dining, bars, movie theaters. You‚Äôre saying 1m couldn‚Äôt would‚Äôve given someone else, consider 300k went lockdown gave 1m it‚Äôs entirely reasonable. unmitigated r0 thought around 5.7 (per cdc.. there‚Äôs varying numbers let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 3). start 100 people, reach 1m new 8 generations (or 40 days assume 5 days infection transmission).. still stay 2m cumulatively Prepared advance???? US 6 months this, Trump still denies serious problem, even cases spiking right front him. said fuck wearing mask home.
I say again. climate like whole Europe Northern U.S. distinct four seasons hope everyone comes votes force fall. lot assholes getting vote. Remember infections US early March. 

How DETECTED infections US had. CDC fucked test kits, basically testing done. Fully understand. know multiple families trying budget home school year. conform stereotype. would invariably involve one parent going part time working. don‚Äôt data indicating people getting sick fast food. could wrong simply data, right looks like transmission happens due airborne contamination/droplets, contact surfaces. still wash hands well, though. Nothing like taking vacation country right middle global pandemic hey. Probably reach 70k today expect reach higher levels sometime next week make 20k private school I'm high risk. üò¨ Immunocompromised human America I'm heavily considering beginning research leaving country Trump gets reelected. probably pan grandma born Ireland paperwork.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* negative, true. probably best call ahead wherever might plan going get tested ask handle things. Realistically, going anywhere, especially somewhere indoors potentially infected people going be, going put risk coming contact virus. However, places testing rules place people coming get tested. 


If personally concerned would probably call primary physician first. clinics around people believe they've exposed call ahead take extra precautions avoid contact patients seeking test. step hi-hat might be. I'm going crash cymbal. work face mask AR-670-1, otherwise uniform scary graphs realise left axis actually go way zero, really 5 times much, really completely screwed... right, much know news. Thank telling this. I'm glad Italy managed control virus, I'm even proud it, course economic impact lockdown going grim everywhere. Tourism important contribution economy, summer many travellers. one way hope pull through.

I think problem America much stupidity, rather paranoia. Paranoia irrational fear something, psychiatric sense word. deep state, pizzagate, Q Anon... conspiracies become infective virus, paranoid thinking becomes normalized. Eventually bound come back bite you.

And way, actually politicians hear conspiracies believe Bill Gates wants kill vaccines. hope going spread well. downvoted.  Pick whatever death rate believe virus .1%, 1% 3% etc. 

You still astronomically higher chance statistically early death due obesity chance complications would vs virus. 

Fauci company even call fat major risk don‚Äôt understand gets upset this. I‚Äôm assuming fat people. air exchange system works aircraft flying. work ground, recirculated air go filter though. believe Texas, Florida Arizona located? that's i'm sharing comments daily discussion post separate post  There‚Äôs proof current ‚Äúintermediate thesis‚Äù. current theory went However single pangolin identified antibodies virus. 

There‚Äôs debate China experimenting human transmission coronaviruses. Chinese labs published papers explaining evolved bat coronaviruses infect human cells! 

My question certain one theory other? There‚Äôs proof either theory. can‚Äôt automatically discount one other. Quick! See anyone patent sun not, let‚Äôs patent it!


-some CEO, somewhere No, first term start..., prison. Congrats Canadian. Thank governor leadership. parents could possibly infect teachers via children, vice versa. Next thing know teachers parents COVID DeVos can‚Äôt 
 Understand happened. Maybe pandemic wake call people take health seriously would explain countries like India South East countries completely devastated virus. BCG part immunisation schedules. one want invade country... already leper colony contained! -taps head.

&amp;#x200B;

The US spreading global security means turning colonized countries leper colonies. perfect. folks got burned club take fire home kill friends family though. soon knew spreading outside china done it. Certainly anything lying American pubic effective masks anything prevent Chinese buying masks. Trump shipped china 18 tons PPE needed. even trying anything sensible. **YOU** power make personal determination wear mask **and** help conserve medical PPE. 

Fauci said much. 

And, agreed, Fauci set federal guidelines, approved later.

Hope helps. nice day. 143,000 extra retesting negative people.

Someone said someone r/FloridaCoronavirus No, companies require people positive get two negative tests return work. state tries count negative test new test, positives skew positivity rate. 

 Link comment: 

 calculates total testing yesterday today subtracting 2,576,813-2,423,992=99,003. divide 15,300/99,003=0.1545 15.5% shown excel sheet. many people died New York?  Yes make difference. Honestly dense can't understand setting narrative ""don't wear mask, useless"" fucking dangerous global pandemic. 

Look state America. see cases spiking enough people wearing masks? 

It's almost words meaning words nations top doctor mean even more. 

It's hilarious originally said: asking people north Dakota wear masks would make difference. 

Because orginally told wear masks shit situation people north Dakota required wear masks effect enough people wearing masks fauci told people üòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠üò≠

Oh irony. I'm ashamed country It‚Äôs probably delayed data. [this site want accurate video shot, know? (E.g. house party, street party, etc...) 

I ask 10pm curfew businesses allow socializing closed except restaurants outdoor dining look underneath charts CDC weekly reports, numbers previous weeks listed, change data specific week continues come in. I've seen data racial COVID stats change data far back 4 weeks (2020 week 22) No, means treat every person meet, person infected. Wear mask, insist wear theirs, stay 2 meters apart other.   Love health friend wife! Please update ‚ù§Ô∏è kid isn‚Äôt sick? Again, parents can‚Äôt stay home jobs? realize kids learning online like would classroom? realize kids need social interaction properly develop, don‚Äôt grow bunch reddit neckbeards thinking virus survival rate end world?

But no. thing matters Covid. Covid 24/7. Nah that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs Florida reports tests previous day instead reporting tests come in. actually positives yesterday presumably, tomorrow see positives today one going change behavior wore mask hospital.

Even anti mask crowd willing wear hospitals. talking California Cali city Colombia? Aww lost 2 letters.. ok? Trump give shit economy, stock market good stock market = good economy elections. 

The economy fucked, 38% country defaulting rent, stock market record levels. That's cares about. Yes say 86 deaths reported today deaths may happened even week ago. I've seen numbers change 18 days later, week number seems pretty stable. Covid-19 novel direct study required make conclusions. Extrapolating past viruses make conclusions new ones dangerous thankfully science works. 

I‚Äôm curious, know know, wearing mask? folks get angry threaten cognitive dissonance. creates stress anxiety, expressed anger hostility. Also shit-scared knowing next paycheck may coming from, when. I've cut family costs couple hundred bucks month stretch savings out. Moved family home, rent. going out, buying non-essentials, cooking everything scratch beans rice veggies, meat condiment. long time, without money coming in, may to. good economy. California seceed US. (And planning it, let know ahead time move there). ...and nurses doctors basically keystone players make economy work. good luck. guy arsehole population 21 million. need say divided state everything? Many people lamenting younger generations lazy, entitled, ‚Äúunable understand sacrifice means.‚Äù honestly think younger generations kind turn. This. sister gf teachers Texas. terrifying knowing many outraged paying work home lives teachers, kids, others work district like janitorial maintenance staff. hypocrisy whining getting outraged lose paycheck work home ridiculous. Even crazier then, should‚Äôve much better handle pyrotechnics 2000s.

Fuck great white Nope. Face mask use respiratory virus transmission studied reason SARS MERSA outbreak wore masks... reason cough directly someone sick feel well.

Fauci spoke 60 minute interview, never said spoke behalf national guidelines. Still speaking still lie. Sounds like super covid they're scared. Newsom's good work completely squandered lack response new outbreak. 

The strategy always flatten curve, slowly reopen local shutdowns control outbreaks. dont follow plan stayed open beginning! meaningless essential seems people know. work home essential. insignificant minority Americans believe individual ~~rights~~ wants important safety others. call toxic patriotism. Americans going absolutely fucked upcoming months, hope avoid getting sick long enough I‚Äôll able get vaccine. yeah might replaced someone brief Trump months refuses criticize president's lies Oh good point, depends good home state‚Äôs contact tracing is. Maybe NY sufficient tracing Took 7 broward County Gotcha, thank you.  disagree, said much worse night, basically called anyone left subversive trying destroy America. speech right fascist. replace word America Italy Germany liberal communist jew one would trouble believing came fascist dictator. government leaders think going go? hasn‚Äôt Florida, Texas Arizona shut down. way even slows everyone stays home month again. dominating world 2020 Covid Games!      
Florida gold medal performance.   
California Texas weak second third respectively. Sad. company closed office till 2021 billions gave churches, TAX EXEMPT. money given people struggling, fucking church. Gotta love capitalism ,especially now. fucking greedy money hungry,psychopathic company!! Profits people folks American way! literally made comment did. individual morbidly obese, underlying health condition. Simply ""having lungs"" long-term goal here? Pretending virus exist short sighted even political strategy. death count hits multiple thousands day hospitals flooded, going get away saying hoax.

Well maybe Republicans fooled, polls show independents tricked. know things bad month they're aware much Trump fucked up. Somewhere inbetween, really. deaths also come reasonably quickly. Others take 4-6 weeks. Blame Utah public education system, garbage. Also state prides anti-intellectualism days week. used live there, scenery great rest... much. 

I checked Facebook page, luckily nobody know taking part. 

Utah beautifully fucked state. Miami county population 2.7 million.

LA county, population 10 million. Almost 4 times big. Natural selection....

In long term, unintelligent old people dying positive economy. weekend numbers usually Sundays. 

Of course 330 reported deaths US past three four Sundays fewer 300 deaths. find whole thing people trying figure whether really ""from COVID"" totally infuriatingly missing point.

Suppose had, e.g., elderly relative died preventable issue usual checkup hospital overwhelmed pandemic could suppressed weeks earlier. sure I'd mad, even they'd never molecule coronavirus within mile body. Ya, stonks honestly brought tears eyes. Flattening curve, vertically. oh sure another outbreak easily start I've got faith NY keeping control states Texas Florida like Florida Texas Arizona, though. severe ""cases"" happening there? government actively trying kill us one gives fuck rural areas ny pretty red people still generally using masks public. I'm happy dumb politicization virus taken completely. Zack shampoo head use soap bar  That's crappy article full misinformation. bad enough Oxford directly responded article. 


It completely ignores fact monkeys got 1/2 vaccine dose bombarded insanely high levels virus. Significantly higher viral load anyone could ever encounter real life. still protected pneumonia lung damage. That's win.  one, thinks knows knows nothing. read paper. incorrect. bullshit people told years let Trump happen haven‚Äôt run math, reason won‚Äôt soon(?) 50,000 day? hope never ! got Birx pass propaganda adjust maps sell party line downplaying virus, everyone caught stopped trusting her. They're mad replace Fauci public's mind. Fauci told truth, tbh, held back ""politics.""  sees result: sky-high cases end sight. he's advising shut-downs, demonize refuse shut want open schools. Look Florida Texas ask sane person would think schools open. Instead actually closing stop infections, blame Fauci go golfing. feel America country believes God? yet Disney still open?! üò≥  that‚Äôs wonderful live together together right now.

Fools believe learned expertise lot fools superspreaders. 

From political standpoint, incredibly dumb. Going popular medical expert plague dumb. Going *popular* public figure opponent election *really* dumb. asking people choose popular person. Even lower popular person's popularity, focused attention candidate ballot. guys four months, really less two months internal party defections start death spiral. Seems government wants get herd immunity fast possible. week saw Starbucks intends close 450 locations open 300 focusing take drive through. daughters company announced longer jobs openings based locations meaning relocate position top 500 fortune company. Means already know vaccine nice conversation reality going live virus like flu. time see drug companies making millions treating us get virus end long term issues. Already see commercials playing. Go NY White House seeks discredit Fauci amid coronavirus surge

Personally, think Fauci could good Trump's thumb. Trump say anything wants. he's at, Fauchi can't. 

Of course, anyone whose organization takes federal funding may get funding cut displeasing Trump. Maybe Fauci's threatened feel leave ""task force."" lot people support policies though mean, 2001 sucked pretty hard us around nyc time...

This year shaping level suck nationally/globally. Lol Yup. Give Bible pair bootstraps. Let's go disney land husband get DeVos need incorporate **systems thinking** simply considering components individually.

California, example, adamant trying ""one-size fits all"" solution, allowing county operate independently. happened people flocked locked-down counties (i.e. Riverside) open ones (i.e. San Diego) brought infections them. Damn Lol, Trumpkins say darndest things. 1) masking. wear mask every time enter store/any indoor facility. I‚Äôm masking country/province state emergency. masking provinces state emergency (see Manitoba case 12 days) /post Covid-19 (you may recall comments mandatory masking flu season ‚Äúit may save one life‚Äù). US much State Emergency therefore wearing masks.

2) it‚Äôs re-writing history. Yeah, know said. it‚Äôs maximizing mask take rates. Like, want maximum number people wearing masks not? Letting Trump show base masks ‚Äúin‚Äù that. 

Like, want people wearing masks not? seems like would rather people wear masks helps 2020 democratic election hopes.....

Why take effing win? Considering virus killed nearly 50x many people 9/11, ten times combined death toll 9/11 wars Iraq Afghanistan, I'd say best defense funding generation. Right, thanks making point me. Good. Scotland, Ireland, and...

(Did see original comment purely sarcasm?) Nobody said forever, schools aren‚Äôt daycare. kid sick keep home, don‚Äôt put others. guess boomers choosing die corona? Wouldn‚Äôt good thing vaccine effective? didn‚Äôt mutate majority population can‚Äôt catch it, wouldn‚Äôt go away eventually? middle January.

I wish people would take virus seriously. fair went soon. 200 new cases per million everyday across country high 500 new cases every day areas, valid safety measures implemented. New cases need shrink drastically even consider person schooling. God hate state reality, probably passed guys weeks ago. stopped keeping track. think people got positive today died 6 hours later you‚Äôre special kind stupid.

but fuckin thing legit made people sick.

What get sick? 

What one older family member dies? 

Do care all? makes sense. using testing anything now. point raising it?  Future analysis everything happening last months interesting sure. one example data set, week 4/18, looks like (based '17-'19 average) taking official tally COVID-19 related deaths, there's still almost 5,000 deaths average was.

It seems much likely deaths people go hospital time, concern COVID-19, related COVID-19, reported such. Taking official COVID-19 related stuff, that's till almost 9% '17-'19 average. expert death rates, seems unusually high, likely statistically significant. living comfortably 6 months expenses cash bank. barely scraping without emergency fund. Even talking family Dr, get mine within day two. times though mine leaves open slots day case someone needs come something that's emergent enough warrant ER visit.

I dont get 5 weeks see dr. Even without family doctor, walk clinics. say fact Jury still unresolved cases can‚Äôt push opposite direction either. number would wrong 4% based that. That's great idea!! I've heard gonna pass everyone know. Oh well. Let's send nose picking butt digging kids back school. Yes, know complain mask play jokes cough others especially sub teachers.  saw pictures people disney world. Everyone actually masks correctly. much risk? I'm obviously going go, I'm curious become epicenter. say ‚ÄúALL died‚Äù.. üò≥ even makes sense? People gone months. surfaces super safe. would say no. think would take uber. Maybe people like sister to, probably mostly people riskier think riding 3 ft car away someone safe. uber driver driving people around. would say high risk situation. Take bus far away people. Haha. Send witch doctor, who'll treat making fetish dead bat pangolin poo burning incense. how‚Äôs reopening Disney going? New York put infected people BACK nursing homes?

I tested day got I'll tested get out. I'm also checking temperature every day. Lol imagining odd movie ride elevator? Possibly. snot hands?  ah... no. Believe not, say masks nearly effective told stupid think. simple ""muh put somethin front face stop disease, eh?"". particles small enough, go right mask, especially cloth masks.

Here's study shows masks almost useless, take account, added dangers wearing masks makes likely harm good. keep pretending case, keep pretending called ""experts"" news politicians spout garbage looking best interests, really aren't. sooner understand that, sooner stop assuming people use masks common mask like, lie say protect COVID say dangers, act like moral high around people wear masks problem, asymptomatic cases extremely unlikely mandatory mask usage become thing stop blue moon case asymptomatic spread, (sort of) good argument making masks mandatory.  depressing thing propagandist piece weak reportage CBS affiliate.

The irony conservatives calling people sheep, believe nonsense like lol 10 mins ago neighbor went tirade saying don‚Äôt work know cause medical field. Mind field many years thinks 100% coup attempt get rid Trump freedom... People want believe US bad China. I've even people argue it. fact call Trump names evident enough lmao  Please use word ""Draconian"". Trump-speak ""I wanna economy!"" makes seem like prison. people like prison. stay home. Shall ""State Quarantine""? People? Thanks. plenty Covid NYC then, didn‚Äôt enough test kits show it. They're 50s. that's fine (if super smart) living them, living them. put original post lol mean 60% New York reaaaally accurate chose test? wonder Gary Larson decided start back last week Ok Trumper. Go lick doorknob. Despite immunity high numbers still reservoirs virus maybe people like Mary. Unless vaccination others get sick. used think empire (the US) could fall like previous empires. Thought happen easily we'll immigrants coming keep tech biotech industry. looks like going crippled economy can't recover unchecked pandemic rest world moves on. won‚Äôt see single positive report unless Biden wins. fear miraculously go away. wait November people shut this. Generally yes, exceptions. deadbolting people homes one point. Trump even disapproves Trumps handling Coronavirus. Maybe consider voting Joe, Donnie. FL expand testing rapidly avoid hitting ceiling. Otherwise they‚Äòll keep getting something like 15-20k new cases prevalence rises unseen. cause GOP finally take seriously ? Oh dang. Yeah 60,000+ Sunday good sign. U.S continues approximately 65,000+ cases day going forward, they'll getting 1 million new cases every 15 days. took 28 days go 2 million 3 million cases U.S, could take half time go 3 million 4 million. 

That's exponential growth folks Fake paper money delusion. metals haha looks like horror story   ... I‚Äôve never actually stopped consider whether child size coffins thing. seems so... morbid, idk regular size coffin would work well smaller ones probably cost special ordered. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è feel blessed I‚Äôve never think child coffin  Public health priority government. Things like economy, jobs, national defense....

But Covid problem world it‚Äôs worst thing ever. Got it. I'm teacher I'd love schools reopened, new cases fall 10 per million so. Right area 400 new cases per million, Germany 2.5 new cases per million, Netherlands 5 new cases per million.

WE want schools reopen, cannot done without getting handle virus first. competent elected officials? true  am, teacher Florida, getting ready fully reopen school 3 weeks. Stay it. focus working days sleeping nights. Eat healthy possible drink enough water. hard times it'll end soon enough.

Much love, stay strong, thank you!!!! genuinely can't understand still blindly reopening. Disney seems hilariously packed best circumstances. Yep. I'm person relies plane get work. I've cut commuting every 6-8 weeks every weeks without flying can't get work live another country. nigh impossible find job locally right due many things I'm kind stuck. well. Thing is, I'm also graduating. y'know what? I'd still rather complicit death others. husband works contractor military, currently Japan. Covid-19 test negative result boarding plane. landed quarantined 2 weeks. tested wait negative result allowed leave quarantine go base/boat. Six feet apart smell musky ass pull ya mask every 15 secs talk nuts. Nowhere world achieved anywhere near herd immunity disease infectious, certainly NY. sounds like listening people using motivated reasoning want stock portfolio crash. aren‚Äôt people Florida protect others.... don‚Äôt realize hand it‚Äôs gotten? Nope, never tested positive virus. never ‚Äústrain‚Äù virus found her.  fact wear masks anyway alone prove anything specific covid-19


Oh really? study face masks respiratory virus transmission 2009 disagrees. anti-mask huh? said prove anything covid-19... like effective anything...

WEAR FUCKING MASK. went dahn jaunt iggle none yinz we‚Äôre wearing face mask dahntown. Bunch jagoffs /s. friend girl got results 4 days they‚Äôre Ocala lasting immunity disease mean vaccines impossible. often short term vs long term antibodies thing, intense disease lead short term antibodies. trick form vaccine let bodies build long term antibodies. We've done plenty others. i'd rather trust Fauci random redditor think they're expert. really never pyrotechnics tiny ass club. believe told gig too. totally irresponsible. Also, Rock good song. fire (anyone wanna guess when?) can't stop giving advice could stop Dr. Oz Dr. Drew so. 

And can't stop listening him. firing make martyr discredit aministration. testing isolating results. absolutely procedure Canada. Anyone test - even without symptoms - concerned enough even without symptoms exposure self-isolating get results AREN‚ÄôT potentially spreading around. heck guys testing way grocery store work? countries banned intercity travel (with exception) constant ""you can't America"" alternative widespread misery death really makes think America's system way past expiration. Fucking shame. RIP. need properly discipline soldier harms civilian, like would US. order that, put someone charge base enforce laws. Create better coordination communication local authorities MPs base ensure military courts adequate resources investigate prosecute misconduct. civilian review board works conjunction local cops MPs bad idea either. Personally also think local authorities jurisdiction prosecute US soldiers sexual assault, homicide attempted homicide occurs Japanese soil. biggest looser study deeply flawed. way calculated people ""damaged metabolism"" normal weight people would qualify well.

If loose huge amounts weight number calories body needs drops lot since less body fuel.

But comes people finished Biggest Loser show went back old eating habits thus inevitably back old weight.

Using study 14 participants stupid. family care leave extended future semesters case vaccine January...or till late next year? He'd right said opposite said  Wait, fuck?

Fucking *seriously?*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fucking beside stupidity south. Oh Jesus. I'm hoping least good may come this, hope sacrifices vain. lot us lose pension strike, pay social security either. literally law charge testing. They've also testing shit ton lowest positive rate two weeks. media tell correct wasting time explaining New York fail someone totally ignorant. whole post makes clear need treat characterization thinking like advocating notion quote. lalalala-I-can't-hear-you method problem solving. Discredit White House one hired advice take it. listen lying sack waste known hunchgut. incredibly exceptional time adapt safest students staff. Masks work airborne respiratory virus people! wonder fanboy. Somehow, using mask solution keeping distance others create faith-based invisible barrier save us all. 

Also, take much searching correct ignorance WHO's mask advice. choice recommend population world wear masks public whether symptoms saying masks work. 

The fail recommend masks, told public use masks. Telling public use masks telling ""masks effective unless..."".

‚ÄúIf repository symptoms fever, cough runny nose, **you need wear a¬†mask**,‚Äù Dr. April Baller, public health specialist WHO, says video world health body‚Äôs website posted March. ‚ÄúMasks **should used** health care workers, caretakers people sick symptoms fever cough.‚Äù  

As idiotic reckless advice was, also released guidance lunatic fringe spreading anti-mask nonsense masks useless covid even dangerous.

But please, let facts rain faith-based parade. Yep, responding correctly well crisis nets people positive reputation.

That went window United States president spent first several months claiming big deal, would disappear own, etc. 

I'm jealous. government run morons. family Tricare Prime cost me, bring on, COVID! (j/k still dont want shit). o7. upvote. Dems going save us.

NY would‚Äôve worse testing scientists medical professionals started seeing months ago becoming clear pervasive thought. (Americans) shocking proportion literally fucking obstinate dumb live...
(From certain perspectives)
I know else call face all.  Wow, incredibly dense.

Obesity self inflicted issue spread people, unlike COVID. Wearing mask actually quite simple mental faculties toddler.  sometimes take 6 weeks see family doctor, go walk clinic day need to. semi-urgent go ER, people within 4 hours. shortage family docs area, options.

Eta: parking $6, although lately gates up, parking free itll spread shelters? MAGA masks, anyone? can't ban interstate travel either.

What's stop state's national guard blocking highways going state couple weeks?

You think there'll war it? COVID problem.... Sample size ? 1 *House owner partially incinerated house tries discredit firefighters amid wildfires surge* need somewhat affordable UVC lightbulb containing mercury.

Less-scary sounding: uncoated compact fluorescent. completely missed sarcasm, sorry mate.

EDIT: obvious though, may want consider adding /s future, people post ridiculous shit completely seriously seem bulk young people (we hear about) dying morbidly obese. like little fat like 30-40 pounds overweight like 100+ overweight.

Edit: Downvote away trend news stories pretty consistent. Trump ban travel China. banned foreigners traveling states China, citizens allowed back without testing quarantine requirement. time Trump reacted, instead ignoring downplaying seriousness, infected people flying countries. Covid doesn‚Äôt job, medical bills finish off... ‚ÄúHow differentiate real news desperate stock market pumps‚Äù I‚Äôm sure understand dichotomy attributing me. discussing lab leak theory- would hypothesize existence bat virus, found nature, isolated, studied lab accidentally infected someone began spreading public. virus may tampered via gain-of-function research increase transmissibility humans. agree insufficient evidence link pangolins SARS-CoV-2 all, read. 

I see reason evidence whatsoever believe virus engineered sort weapon might intentionally released mankind. also see evidence sort virus created scratch (no zoonotic source) sheer scientific prowess. discounting sheer implausibility, though course nothing *100%* ruled out. 

(Note: also entirely open possibility zoonotic spillover occurred naturally wild well- case could bat virus, could virus, could animal virus, don‚Äôt know. ) using conference rooms hallways temporary beds here... Link? E X P N E N L WINNING Thank wearing mask. yes unfortunately direct study required learn novel viruses behave. use past data similar viruses make hypothesis inform study design that‚Äôs pretty much it.

For it‚Äôs worth, you‚Äôre probably nice guy tone combative makes hard civil conversation. thought.  Oh, good point! posted article earlier there's outbreak COVID county New York, they've traced travel back Georgia.

So maybe one states good contact tracing northeast catch it. I‚Äôm SE Texas produce I‚Äôve gotten delivered fantastic. one delivery guy pick rotten lettuce celery, I‚Äôve amazing produce. Pisses government banning live venues. hard it? Melbourne they've started getting 200+ cases day pretty much instantly everything closing again.

North Dakota bad almost 100 day confirmed community transmission different countries still locked down. Come guys... think, here, context US. especially since states right next NM close experiencing exponential growth hospitalizations, doctor would say science behind mask use context. science said debatable. isn‚Äôt. 

You guys great job New Zealand! Keep up! see saying, New England city life seem anticipate lifestyle future can't exist without rural work. 

Where think food comes from? rural farms meat-packing areas open working city workers stayed home spreading virus Washington, already started food shortages mass slaughter farm animals workers sick continue provide people. Midwest, South, California provides food table.

Without rural areas, cities would starve. highly educated boast, come news you. Acting city people best people astoundingly short-sighted ignorant approach situation hand. look rural people less educated, decided pursue art degrees whatever higher education could name, would put food table?

I'm nursing student two Bachelor's, now, graduate degree way. see lot people scoffing poor, often poor built made possible succeed sweat. little respect people advantages go amiss. They're ignorant poor choice.

Also, I've lived Boston Western Mass. rural areas liberal rural areas South, Boston one racist cities country. Northeast liberal accepting anywhere else country. ‚Äúexperts‚Äù ‚Äúscientists‚Äù said lock two weeks ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù. 

You realize second order destruction full lockdown full month would‚Äôve done right? cares, Covid thing matters. 'but economy!' argument drives mad.

It's ""but economy!"", ""but rich people!"". Everyone else chess pawn. matter many die. Texas TEA released ""plan"" last week, many districts however not. believe referring virus burning since infected enough people reach herd immunity. That's good point. simple. think school person fall remote learning. two options. many people dngaf here. maddening.  spent two god damn months 425sqft apartment, ever leaving pick weekly groceries. seen friends since February. people know same.

These days leave house often, go art studio tenant, go bike ride. Occasionally I'll get coffee outdoor shop, stay drink it.

We did, continue do, fucking part rest country can't bothered wear god damn mask. February China 40 minute turnaround covid tests. hell going US?! like intentionally fucking us up. Luckily candidate promises that. Oh wait... Yep, stuff crazy expensive top shit. wouldn‚Äôt doubt it. morbidly obese already makes difficult breathe without lungs messed up. Idk you‚Äôve ever seen someone weighs 350+lbs lay back don‚Äôt usually long. C'mon dude. Mistakes made left right beginning pandemic one knew hell going on. Using criticize successful turnaround beyond stupid. Agreed, that's responding to.  definitely able impose tougher restrictions dependent base. particular lodging small point allowing mission essential reservations. I've many people pissed telling can't stay unless orders. ""How X base able make leisure reservations can't? Hmmm???"" think somehow caught trying lie say shit. people say make sense, others said discriminating retirees/veterans, crazy amount people trying straight lie us orders. fucking frustrating. too, stay safe. I'll victories can. point, second wave comes, instead preventing it, control second wave, minimize impact. forget vitamin deficiency (not magic cure deficiency means BAD time) - fat people likely deficient, old people likely deficient, brown people likely deficient.

A fat brown dude working 12 hour shifts hospital almost CERTAINLY vitamin deficient. would expect pay grand fly NY LA maybe half Boston Chicago. putin Russia, phases ~~complete~~ end Particularly [SARS-CoV-2 directly kill CD4+ CD8+ leading common symptom/sign intresting graphic US school (normaly) It‚Äôs like everyone thinks immune skyrocketing blames governor everything. action prevented spread actions everyone recent reopening, rude awakening. anyone know people getting tested display symptoms get tested? playing ball means people interacting closely social situations that's going happen good amount people allowed together extra familial groups. We're social animals physical interaction innately ingrained us.

You see things like violence go dense communities many signals ease potential conflicts, ""hugging, hand shakes, smiles"" discouraged. 

There many small sociological impacts happening radar due larger focus things need stop spread Covid. Things we'd much better equipped take note well funded educational system non-divided political sphere. many months shortness breath weak muscles, think may recovered 95% physical abilities stricken COVID-19 January. would liken symptoms recovering mild case polio. 

Now able hike many 9 miles single stretch, I'm dealing unusual soreness thighs. lung capacity much better, nut compromised compared infection. XRay CT scans clear ""unremarkable"". 

Note: taking Vitimin catching COVID-19 blood tests show low, may saved me. take much higher dose 5,000 iu daily.

It predicted half planet's population would perish. one time, visualize disaster, today, we're watching unfold real time. We're literally watching US collapse right everyone plays Pyro TF2 we're good. Trying top time record. true Mackenzie! Probably lobbyists too. Oh look. Another idiot. I'm epidemiologist theory yes, virus mutate, infected develop immunity ok. RNA viruses historically known mutate though see unfortunately. ""get money"" point view. Reopen everything restart profits corporate coffers, force people back work throw unemployment cut taxes rich friends even already has. You‚Äôre downvoted advisors don‚Äôt decide federal policy. president does. It‚Äôs administration, anyone else‚Äôs. folks scapegoating Fauci crap way, *way* base. went ""Ayyyyy ohhhh dis stupida"" ""omg okokok""
Florida won't. unless bribe deep fried battered sticks butter smothered gravy. guarantee happened they'd best numbers time. economy reopen... Period. death toll would far far high. People ignore friends dying go work anyway. ready see five go ten percent Americans dead year? That's worst possible outcome unless people moderate behavior happen Officially, 21.5M Florida residents. However, lots vacation homes. compute per capita statistics, 21.5M right denominator? need include sizeable part-time Floridians?

Also, dear Florida, funny anymore. I'm half imagining sending letter like...""so strongly advise attending. already know Florida?"" Thank you, wife already debating whether hand notice RN, take break, kinda mulling own, little research, think bring tonight. puts smile face shows matter live, still many valuable educators country despite constraints complexities remote learning able show compassion understanding students parents. strive flexible possible know new way learning challenge everyone. I‚Äôm happy daughter‚Äôs teacher able help daughter received credit properly deserved putting hard work. Probably best to. sick, rest one important things body needs fight illness. Exercising good immune system long-term actually ill.  Yes. little perspective helps. Everyone thread makes sound like fat guaranteed death sentence covid isn‚Äôt. 

Source: nurse works covid unit. Ehh 1 6 becomes infected like Mississippi liable change tune real quick South Carolina well CFR. 950 deaths, far 1.7% 56,485 positive tests cases. However, 1,472 hospitalized cases 188 ventilators add 2610 deaths high risk cases potential 4.6% deaths national average. Sad face emoji. 

God , hope catch virus. let's put frown face! dude. honestly, fine here. timeline tho. 

Presymtomatic/asymptomatic covid spread wasn‚Äôt confirmed early April. That‚Äôs social mitigation became feasible. common WHO/CDC/HHS recommendation worldwide till primarily social distancing. 

And Fauci determine federal policy. CDC HHS, matter. They‚Äôre part Executive Branch answer president. role advise; president sets federal policy. Non-American here. What's stopping Federal government compelling Florida wear masks? Trump? symptoms strep probably get tested strep. something want leave untreated. would imagine doctor could test Covid time. Extrapolating past viruses make conclusions new ones dangerous thankfully science works. 

Do think everytime find new virus discovery start scratch? Lol also think reinvent wheel anytime make car? 

Dude that's exactly research learning works. called coronavirus comes family corona ""crown"" viruses. There's tons learn viruses studying family. 

Bro ever gotten flu vaccine life? There's hundreds thousands strains pick deadliest one vaccine absolutely count using data viruses flu. 

Have ever taken math class? extrapolate earlier information concepts. multiplication without first learning count? 

Same logic applies biotech. tell STEM major minor.

I've wearing mask outdoors since march first lockdown took place. watched come china Europe US. 

If wear masks reduce transmission, wear masks too. virus simply transmit mouth American. literally never stepped foot inside public school, say matter? Yep... I‚Äôm Philly suburbs it‚Äôs frustrating. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs 90% mask wearing. Social distancing still followed part. 

Every time state releases new case numbers, Allegheny county responsible least 25-30% new cases. Welcome NM, diseased thieves act like ancestors. somehow killing innocent, unarmed individuals disease interpreted superior. would vague. vague. 


I mentioned two specific things. High blood pressure uncontrollable diabetes. DeVos‚Äôs wet dream Depends context. Im New Zealand head doctor explicit would enforce manadatory mask use. Why? science masks doesnt work infection rate never risen level necessary use masks. stage harm good. low levels masks necessary infection rate reached US epidimiologists says ""science behind masks"" doesnt work would absolutley challenge that. Everything bigger Texas... Florida Man again! confirmed spread air conditioning systems? even thought look one. cause medical field.

I'm gonna guess CNA medical assistant. plenty people trying right thing, dont currently power structure government cant much November :/

I wish ability hold referendums like UK get President fuck outta dodge. Oh boy I'm sorry hear governor‚Äôs behavior treated criminal? cut Florida rest nation? aid mind prevent travel from. actually isn‚Äôt true. eat fewer calories you‚Äôll lose weight first six months you‚Äôre obese body slow metabolism gain back lost weight believes obese state correct state wants defend weight. order keep weight you‚Äôll need constantly reduce much eat battling feeling tired lowered metabolism. That‚Äôs people go diets tend lose weight quickly vast majority people gain weight back 2 year mark.

If want public example true look folks [Biggest Loser TV show. vast majority people regained weight folks tried incredibly best way deal obesity prevent people becoming obese begin with. you‚Äôre already obese problem body believes it‚Äôs supposed unhealthy weight everything keep weight on. Calories calories works great first six months body heavily clamps metabolism thinks it‚Äôs starving. calories burned rest tank, feel tired becomes extremely extremely difficult active keep actively burned calories up. It‚Äôs entirely impossible, people religiously push exercising habits time constantly pushing calories manage eventually reset body‚Äôs weight set point. means 10 people stick diet start exercising keep so, 1 every 10 manage keep weight year 2.

FYI, I‚Äôm doc who‚Äôs focusing learning obesity treat it. You‚Äôre making sound like obese people lazy slobs eat endlessly. reality you‚Äôre obese body lot shitty things make nearly impossible reverse without intervention. Hmmm bot like something said uncivil all. curse word towards you....I'll remove repost. work I'll PM response you. that's die can't get covid test pass - atypical pneumonia. 200+ known influenza strains change much. Unfortunately, would likely die tried immunize time. Thus, year vaccine 3-4 different likely strains it. Wisconsin surging then? type title ""Ultraspreader - man China spreads millions people months."" Except eating habits. Eat less, avoid processed sugars, exercise, lose weight. Ok, I‚Äôm running energy keep talking this. I‚Äôm going end saying this: aiming ZERO exposure virus. small amount virus exposure make us sick, like single hair tiny amount virus it. risk getting high initial dose virus, resulting high viral load nobody‚Äôs getting washing hair grocery shopping. Guidelines need actually add vaue recommended. haven‚Äôt shown recommended health professionals.

I‚Äôm out. Lol go right ahead. want masked rest life sense moral superiority, go it. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get plenty Instagram likes one self inflicted

And yet United States obese country earth, higher heart disease rates people die heart disease anywhere else (psst...heart disease kills people yearly Covid). diabetic country earth.

Don‚Äôt care fellow Americans, fellow human beings? call write politicians demanding unhealthy foods banned least heavily taxed. Shut fast food chains flatten curve obesity epidemic. #eatathome It‚Äôs really matter opinion, nobody making definitive statements. opinion COVID immunity situation could lot worse think seems be. Yup dad wait 9 days. also drive 80 miles get tested appointment bc everything around testing Walmart sports stadiums people social distancing That's problem... even reopen every restaurant... risk dying multinational post record quarter even get benefit from...

Americans tend think ""white people"" whole, that's clearly big simplification case Europe, even union trying build common culture via programs like Erasmus.   context, I'm expat living Malaysia one first countries get case outside China. active cases 64 total deaths 122.

People saying start schools others think means *no schooling* all. 

Others say need start schools up, mean safety measures online need to.

There many unclear points messaging here.  think even that. think pure stupid negligence, covering asses pretending kind plan.

It's like got leak house. ignored - plumbers expensive, would shut water temporarily, maybe stop own? leak gets worse. Ooof, going cost even money fix, take longer. Let's put bucket it. Hmmm, bucket overflowed pipe leaking three places. going REALLY expensive fix! basement, cares basement gets wet, can't shut water, get thirsty use toilet plumber arrive?

So basement flooded water pouring pipe like faucet we're paying water plumber, also electrician foundations expert need, say ""well we'll shut water half, that's enough right? we'll hire plumber. fixed day, we'll turn water back full, need water!""

And on. problem gets worse, fix gets expensive, house gets ruined, chucklefucks sit roof whole thing sinks saying ""Well, look water perspective!""

Even rich people benefitting this. may live master bedroom we're basement, we're damn house.   referred Trump's Razor:

After careful consideration possibilities, Donald J Trump almost always choose worst course action. Question lawyers there.

They're fine damn democrats really going hoax right? /s People need accept living virus awhile. Mask wearing social distancing really tools right now. can‚Äôt hide house keep schools closed two years. needs level societal risk.

edit: autocorrect ‚ò†Ô∏èüéâ: state subreddit ICU lower April/March cause therapies advanced now, thanks work guys studied medicine 10y+ treated corrupted motherfuckers mass. result sacrifice lives patients, first treated mothrfucking covid. don‚Äôt know someone responsible this, hope burns hell. Good point üò¨üò¨üò¨ understand every fucking thing perfectly. I'm arguing notion better health would help ability survive, saying best option. one people control underlying health problems another preventative solutions scientifically give best odds survivability. Probably young kids college aged individuals spreading amongst able fight off, keeping distance elderly? playing game extending unemployment. economy right cruising extra payments. hoping people forced go back work risk lives right election. tout ‚ÄúGreatest increase greatest jobs ever!!‚Äù likely ton people little money angry. predicting lies past that.

Wow. never stop &amp; think educates them. think school exists without teachers students. tell parents ask really thinking demand schools fully open. Yes?

Covid deaths coronavirus causing this, reaction virus. Good fucking point. looooooooove shift blame people issues. We‚Äôre fucking abusive relationship government. Well above. I'd bet true number 500million+. consider third world countries like India regions like Middle East, Africa, tiny fraction tests modernized nation's infectiousness disease along long adds up. visited Okinawa lived Japan. time ever felt uncomfortable Japan around American servicemen. fact, BIL (Navy) specifically told stay away bars assholes go to. Hubby chill ass bar 2 servicemen walked vibe totally changed. unreal. Nothing crazy happened stay long took BIL's advice. wish, Mayor Governor worried revenue backlash another shutdown.  OP‚Äôs story anecdotal, statistics nutrition fitness don‚Äôt lie. need look bodies more. pretty obvious plague god punishing meattards examine caused people died look like Dudes going able take stairs months least. yesterday. Jfc. even open *know* they'll end closing? May, approximately 20% NYC residents tested positive antibodies. That‚Äôs herd immunity. exactly provide childcare? opening places children go day - maybe educate there? know like school? 

The federal government resources provide food shelter large percentage population. country does. many bars, certain state federal leaders trying force crowded schools together they‚Äôll spend long periods together often mingling hallways cafeterias well classrooms. mean, 100 percent effective vaccine anything? 

 Let‚Äôs real here. Probably closer 1 billion making death rate infentismally low worth even worrying going real honest Stop posturing bullshit trump somehow fighting virus. words didn‚Äôt think threat, obviously taking opportunity ban foreigners obvious extension ongoing battles China. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs secret trump motivated anti-China, anti-covid. 

This obvious fact banned Chinese nationals coming here, Americans could travel back pleased. That‚Äôs action control virus looks like. We're killing it! ....Literally. Fundraiser Lol. issue isn‚Äôt lack control power, denial. federal government actually addressed COVID, might better spot.

The ‚Äúok states, handle yourself‚Äù approach administration resulted haphazard policies. 'But muh economy' bad one 150 per day one family members. feel like every time wakes up, someone tell ""You can't make things worse"" every time, answers ""Watch me"" It‚Äôs much line way school districts presently run. MBA, less Head Teacher. adult human data nodes supposed get smaller human data nodes correct position Excel graph end quarter.

School much, much different place (Gen X) kid, although teachers try keep warm personal can. also avoid bothering management petty concerns possible. might think Sweden nothing virus declining anyway (only Swedish bad news seems reported abroad little rambling ""off chest"")


Sweden still limit 50 people event. big amusement parks closed. Concerts performances closed limited 50 people. (BLM protests 50 hence quite peacefully slowly dissolved police)


Social distancing big thing. mandatory keep 1m (3ft) distance groups restaurants. mandatory every shopkeeper enable social distancing. shops floor marks clear plastic screen separating cashier customers.


People still work home can. Avoid public transportation seat cannot booked. Avoid seeing people ones regularly meet. Avoid making new friends. (Risk groups stricter guidelines)


Twice week people charge (officials health crisis management) press conference (live stream YouTube) literally beg Swedes keep following recommendations, keep good work, endure relax. also answer questions journalists.


Thank reading sorry wall text. That's one reason. Another massive population migrating neighboring regions. relief workers need PPE risk. Hospitals down, instead using field hospitals COVID used replace hospitals functioning. Shelters traditionally packed facilities (like stadiums), awful. 

On top that, massive human nature issues. ""Massive migrant populations bringing disease"" usually hot-button republican areas. People duress give shit different sets state laws regarding masks social distancing, need policed. 

Economically speaking, cash spare emergency relief point. Sure, federal government greenlight stuff, levels lack available capital, people left desolate it.

COVID strained _everything_. room stretch without things snapping. WEAR MASK, silly. that‚Äôs irrelevant. discussion never me. 

That said, ad hominem isn‚Äôt convincing argument. anything better, I‚Äôm confident would used now. :(

And misrepresented study aside, coronavirus isn‚Äôt flu, although I‚Äôm confident know already, too. And, again, ad hominem doesn‚Äôt change that.

Have good day. correct. Realistically class sizes larger 20! Maybe take week returns monitor situation. switch jobs? Seriously, sounds super dangerous. bring back mason-dixon instead slavery science vs Jesus. keep Trump, too. Bread milk, milk bread! TOILET PAPER Probably best send Corpus Christi service south Texas (CC San Antonio) there. Houston needs reopen NRG Covid hospital let national guard run it. Oh, I'm sure heart attack actually caused brain get oxygen. believe result complication COVID19.  pretty good here. Yes find plenty people tons stories people flipping refuse wear one can't shop groceries. 


I prefer stories have, public shaming yelling people masks.


Sadly, almost opposite many places. somewhere enforcing masks social distancing, even business mandated to, always one group Bubba's Karen's loudly bitching it. lesson exponential growth. virus starts slow eventually cases slowly creep point control pretty much late US still base Japan? Wow. disturbing... Good luck everybody wants play guinea pig, especially new RNA vaccine. Heaven forbid law change adapt modern times... impact one. one fucking person difference 0 cases 11k.  looks super cool. haven‚Äôt seen person, fianc√© knows chef restaurant got tour opened said it‚Äôs huge. There‚Äôs lot outside space. pandemic I‚Äôll check out, hopefully hype die won‚Äôt crowded.  America never stops amaze shutdowns like cutting leg avoid risk breaking it. wonder excess deaths Covid-19 death count. tip iceberg. Yeah, 2020 definently ""experiment"" sure. Well mask know hates smearing makeup, something happened

I'm assclown personally Nope! like 80¬∞ whole time parents can't work home all? friend recently divorced can't work home. trying figure school two children (2nd 3rd grade) day, send dad (also able work home) work 4-9 M-F every weekend get 40 hours. That's madness. Many people situation schools open, forced send children unsafe schools. me, handle seeing people knew fun live seemingly great lives without me. made feel worthless, like nobody would care dead. Also, started couple major fights good friends politics. 2010! Australian here, locked closed everything (I lost bar), done everything opening. government set aside billions help keep jobs pay lost theirs. half put aside used. almost stop spread covid, economy goes back normal faster.  long exists super majority White.

Heck... saw digging mass grave big enough thousand bodies, right road me. Yeah, disguised new sewer line, **official** story. lot still think hoax. Several deaths today people believed Trump/Fox virus real.   (a) people directly responsible health measures local state officials

(b) functioning democracy, elected officials get deposed, certainly jailed, bad policy decisions

(c) much Trump way would probably make things better, bringing administrations actually making important decisions (notably mayor governor NY) middle crisis would lead chaos certainly make things worse came view pandemic, yes, did. New cases found following counties:

I know wear doctors know told this. beautiful. Thanks linking it! finally found smudge-proof bronzer Covid deaths reported around world Keep train rolling! Choo choo! It‚Äôs wonderful alright. in, we‚Äôll *wonder* eff thinking decided it. Covid-19: Oh boy, go infecting people again! brave, strong. Old people immunocompromised people. :( Oh cmon, they're 40% last week. /s well atleast finally listening imagine could done start?! money India worst hit said done. Also... let's keep kids school day virus run wild, mutate another strain predominately kills young people like 1918 flu. could possibly go wrong?  1. hope enjoy ICU. /s There's direct evidence viral infections protests Houston cities. Unfortunately, DeBlasio prevented contact tracers NYC asking protest attendance. That, handwringing epidemiologists NYT article tell need know protests' role infection.

2. legitimate valuable causes. people care them, large crowds protests signal ignore pandemic control measures, enabled latest surge infections around country.

3. Demonstration large groups way affect change. effective thing could raise money organizations lobby changes want, raise money campaign officials candidates support changes desire. could engage discussions social media, start podcast discussing issues, write op-eds start organization works change. Standing group street corner sign fun sexy; oftentimes even effective way make change. Hasn‚Äôt happened around trump yet don‚Äôt really expect to. People keep giving wants. mean, ridiculed Biden wearing since day 1. get brownie points finally putting one photo op. Utah, prefer encourage people right thing rather issuing mandates demanding compliance

Do think anyone going buy bullshit? Utah closest thing theocracy US, strongly prefer mandating encouraging. don‚Äôt want people wear masks, that‚Äôs won‚Äôt mandate it. Yep. long short it:

We fucked up.  That's Americans need welded inside point deaths get way hand.  remember somewhere around .8 .9, sure saw though. 

Either way, still way high.

Edit: apparently .7 according interwebs, know Lindsey Graham enters chat room universal mask wearing solution drop cases. blaming factors? People third world countries information cdc wear mask helps USA has. Yeah tests totally kicking ass at? even online? schooling better schooling. no! bad consumer! Family Ireland. Im Irish national living London past 6 years. hoping see family soon, due 14 day quarantine way anybody travelling UK, can't afford miss equivalent month work. 

However, cousin mine visited Kerry London. Got 4th, temperature taken before/after/during flight, wear mask, question asked staying. affirm needed quarantine whatsoever point, needed stay inside.

They got back yesterday, issues getting back, told quarantine either. Gate empty Stansted way in, walked gate practically car went home. 

Although I've read precautions Ireland putting place (which fantastic), seem rules put practice reality. Damn right elected officials.  Hmm thanks taking time reply, actually reassuring. 

I‚Äôd feel terrible son contracted died- I‚Äôd never live I‚Äôd lose shit. teen starting senior high school year fall.

Management able replace them, especially new hires maligned going interest group. This..*unified front*...could method bargaining safe work conditions equitable pay structures. 

I get people need money, money vs extreme sickness possible death coworkers *as well hundreds thousands children*. Money ain't worth it. July anyone wants wear mask wearing one. problem people don‚Äôt want wear one. Wearing mask learned behavior reinforced becomes second nature, like wearing seatbelt. 

Since masks ‚Äúwear want‚Äù thing small % population wore them. people weren‚Äôt wearing making fun people were. people NEED wear people associate wearing mask made fun refuse wear them. 
Check r/NFL‚Äôs draft day post great example people making fun Giant‚Äôs GM wearing mask wearing masks go out? fair, Covid *wasn‚Äôt* immediate threat US January.

Seems Florida 100% decided economy important keeping however many people die Covid, alive. NBA crowd without?  point social gatherings (including funerals) spread disease. 

There funerals held 3-4 people lived deceased, suppose. Yup. Birx lost respect tried explain away Presidents disinfectant comments. wonder protests effecting this, know they're still going even media covering much anymore Sorry probably added sarcasm. irritated carelessness shown Charlotte. feel like people wear masks grocery store public places, go family BBQ friends take mask off. state, spread small family gatherings. get it‚Äôs hard stay strong family telling it‚Äôs fine take off, better. trust one. fucking idiot mental health facility? yes. last week went take toddler 15 month shots well baby visit. first appointment day monday. went asked receptionist ok bring wasnt wearing mask, medical assistant...the medical assistiant complaining feeling good. turned around left... mask mandated tx btw...i agonizing taking shots wait appropriate time different practice (shes 18 months btw putting beginning pandemic)... quick run health food store produce things. im ok going enforce masks part.

Pockets people self isolating would closer 0, using subway working living people it. Plus testing people symptoms. Given criteria surprised numbers high lots places virus affected idiots... don‚Äôt buy ‚Äúyoung children can‚Äôt get sick‚Äù thing. Plenty children died this.

Actually, children without pre-existing conditions died (3 15,230 confirmed Covid-19 deaths New York May 13 0-17 age group without pre-existing conditions - source: Worldsmeters.info). comparison, 59 kids age group killed car accidents new York 2017 (so roughly 5 per month). suppose strongly oppose putting children car?

They also seem likely spread infected sending school much risk people like believe. Like said, reopening schools (with social distancing increased hygiene measures place) Europe hardly influence numbers.

The alternative case (worse education, loss family income, financial insecurity) also carries certain risks, like everything do. Contractor here. bases mandates soldiers wear masks. time seen soldier actually wearing one general room. Coronavirus good news: anyone anything specific? see us going cases starting freak like March/April. I‚Äôm school teacher scared go back. Way go Florida!!! lead way!! Us dumbasses Texas aren‚Äôt far behind tho, better keep up! article gives sources getting data. live Florida, people tested (including medical field working Covid patients) gone 6+ weeks without able get results results. Yet daily statistics continue reported major media outlets. Actually yeah, go work sick. starting wear mask. Why? I'm interested killing others.

The difference going McDonald's clogging arteries virus virus discriminate. one self inflicted harms person themselves.

You attitude death millions people. Sicko. USA. Breaking records everyday. blas√© attitude health worker, someone supposed know better, makes shocking. mention pregnant... good lord. Deaths aren‚Äôt metric matters. virus leading permanent lung damage instance, well patient complaints ongoing extreme fatigue pain months bodies rid virus. Solely based fact 1% chance meeting person virus, guarantee someone Disney virus, fact, guarantee multiple somebodies virus given moment Disney.

And that's without asymptomatic patients. She‚Äôs wrong. Schools open up. It‚Äôs educational fiasco expect level education socialization home parent can‚Äôt also work. kids‚Äô school figured out. schools figure too. 

It depends crowded classes are. could A/B schedules, morning/afternoon, 6 days 3 3 out. remote. in. Open doors windows, reduce classroom changes, eliminate assemblies, classes outside possible. It‚Äôs magic. edited‚Äî spoke essential workers speaking frontline essential workers luxury staying home.

And yes, everyone presents threat health, whether wearing mask not. risk extremely increases person wearing mask even start yelling ‚Äòrights‚Äô wear mask.  COVID sure highlighted many anti-science folks there. It‚Äôs okay, armed children protect armed teachers ! That's disingenuous best. conflating vocal, loud minority Republican imbeciles parents simply cannot anymore, people simply cannot afford work anymore, etc.

Yes lot people idiots think conspiracy ""not bad, like flu"" hell lot people simply can't cope point. MUST work homeless. good day, say random Tuesday year ago, number Americans one full paycheck away homelessness millions, we've reached breaking point. saw Florida rest country now? want infecting me. prime minister Germany pointing days ago.

You say viable solution, explain dozens countries far poorer US implemented longer lockdowns, committed providing help average citizens, near bad situation are? b*tch sucks sooooo much. Another truly terrible human TrVmp admini$tration. asked someone last year wear masks outside they‚Äôd say course not, what‚Äôs point lmao 10,000 one day, couple days ago. 11,000 one day, yesterday. it‚Äôs 15,000 one day??????

36,000 cases 3 days???

Florida needs get damn shit together. know, live there. Yep. Disney getting even single positive word on. I‚Äôd say ‚ÄúDarwin awards‚Äù it‚Äôs fair they‚Äôre clearly going ones affected piss poor judgement decision making. willing make gamble?

Please advised opinion largely based experiences Europe, people generally take quite seriously recommended especially mandatory precautions followed pretty well.

I kids forgive something happened could prevented. worried schools reopened, also reassured measures taken minimize risk.

When schools opened live, opened gradually part-time keep ""contact bubbles"" classes separated. Every time previous step cause decline number infections stop, relaxed restrictions bit more. Reopening school cause rise cases here. Face masks recently became mandatory stores public places distancing hard impossible. 

Stay safe!  do. love casseroles Midwest early March, 5 weeks **after** Chinese locked Wuhan surrounding areas, mention **after** Italians locked entire Lombardy surrounding areas. something like 60+ million people lockdown. would Fauci think ok go cruise? also bet hammering behind stage crashing markets.

Unless evidence, wild speculation. fair, options. starters, state-level decision-making. Florida (and know everywhere), Mayors taken mask ordinances. also city ordinances, business-specific rules, individual decision making.

At end day, people causing free will. personal freedom they're bitching wanting. can, ourselves, also choose participate idiocy healthier it.

Personally masks, like commenter said seems thing brought halt measures too. ^(you can't **trotsky*** experiment like large population inadequate safety efficacy results.) I'm Republican denier I'm advocating people stay home quarantine, social distance wear masks essential activities? Fuck. swear soon get hands keyboard, logic reasoning fly right window. gentleman get virus fat, got taking care completely irredeemable human beings yourself. know science also proves? Dont contract virus 100% chance dying it. Also information I'm far left political spectrum means keep attempting failing push unsubstantiated narrative. arguing better health help. I'm saying incredibly obvious 'advice'.

Not obvious enough look up- downvotes. whole comment chain sparked someone going ‚Äúthe virus discriminate‚Äù, obviously load bollocks.

People downvoted pointing mortality rate lower young non-obese.

I‚Äôm arguing Florida Texas shouldn‚Äôt use masks. every American went diet, would probably helpful social distancing lol. thought thing. Screw United States America guess. can't even understand needs create division. realize second order destruction full lockdown full month would‚Äôve done right?

A things worth noting:

-Around time DeSantis signed executive order protecting nursing home patients, mayor New York attempting court tourism encouraging people see plays, governor New York signed order demanding nursing home patients tested positive sent back facilities, increasing risk vulnerable populations.

-The states New York Florida extremely similar population sizes, Florida much higher percentage population (roughly one five) susceptible age demographic (65+). spite this, Florida 1/10th deaths age demographic.


-Roughly half Covid19 deaths occur nursing homes America Europe. reducing death rate important you, focusing nursing home policy logical place start. 


-Most new infections happening Democrat districts among younger populations. 


(Also, remember protests weeks back? Think might played role?)

Edit: downvote without rebuttal. Imagine shock. POS  Lol Incredible. also 100k tests, dropping percentage positive 15%. (I exact figures front pardon inexactness)

15,300 new cases 15% positive real nightmare. hope positive cases otherwise healthy lower risk individuals. live Louisiana. folks live NOLA took 20 days (14 business days) get thier results.  I'm considering creating multi-factorial model new detected cases percent positive predict total new cases. New cases underrepresent total cases everyone gets tested testing gets overwhelmed. Positive percent random sample people symptoms far likely get tested. 

Both variables combined give much better estimate happening looking either individually. 

We enough death data fairly good estimate IFR% estimate past total new cases train model to. understand lag deaths new cases. 

I want reinvent wheel. anybody done already? feel would handy.

For instance would able compare Florida 15k new cases 15% positive NY previously 10k new cases 50% positive. really know worse, feel like we've got enough data combine numbers better understand mean. end I'm hoping equation along lines 

c1 x [percent positive] + c2 x [new cases] = [estimated total cases]. They've also reached highest numbers test results tests administered. positivity rate continuously climbing. Today's actually one lower positivity rates past week, read correctly, 11.25%. number primarily driven quantity testing (over 135K today, 140K returned yesterday).

RIP. I‚Äôm sorry false information chose believe ended costing greatly. It‚Äôs sad. don‚Äôt think OP picked right thread start conversation, also think you‚Äôre misinterpreting he‚Äôs saying.

This nurse didn‚Äôt catch Covid obese. caught treating Covid patients. obesity significantly raise odds dying Covid severe complications. It‚Äôs possible happen young, healthy, thin person, too, it‚Äôs statistically much likely happen obese person.

We need taking precautions. means social distancing, washing hands, wearing masks stop spread. also means taking better care health we‚Äôre better position survive get sick.  don‚Äôt google terms see come miss days even reached 100,000 cases crazy talk going spread like wildfire world. üò≠ Hahahahha literally commented another thread asking lady got medical degree MLM course. hate MLMs.

Mankind may doomed phenomenon combined internet bringing age misinformation. Achilles heel democracy majority morons, getting dangerous close that, may unable recover become true majority. Yep. kind reaction too. super bummed cancel annual St Pete trip year. Thanks making feel little bit better that!  Fever caused cytokines, is, immune response. immune response last much longer viral infection, especially ARDS/pneumonia. prevailing theory severe cases go state hyperinflammation possibly cytokine storm, virus essentially cleared prior that. Less intense cases may experiencing residual flare ups responses tissue damage, correct saying unsolved mystery now.

The spike protein really confer anything extremely special virus seen coronaviridae. least point I'd disregard know viruses. also worry much MHC downregulation, especially since seem enter state chronic infection. may evading immune response time, body appears able clear virus, even probably relies NK cells immune mechanisms finding viral peptides MHC option.

Overall, can't say I've terribly surprised virus. Terrified times, surprised. Unless start recognize signs chronic infection, we're looking cytokine storm hyperinflammation, things personally studied years. quite deadly, recoverable beat it. That's say can't develop permanent damage. long evidence chronic infection (and far), think many things pathophysiology appear follow traditional dogma disease behavior.

tl;dr think extraordinary virus, deadly contagious one. Certainly funky things, nothing warrants ""forget everything know viruses"" response scientists. One care insofar humans, people actually psychopaths. behavior endangers everyone comes contact them. Gotta get tuition money...then die....NO REFUNDS! That's funny.

So might actually looking 1 10 people meet America. Yeah, really. Maybe 0.5 %, since know 10x cases basically asymptomatic, spreading essentially unchecked manner. 

I don‚Äôt think even total lockdown three months would enough now, you‚Äôve got couple months exponential growth pretty much locked in, damage second lockdown would also catastrophe. 

So choice evils.

It‚Äôs possibly late prevent full herd immunity ‚Äòattempt‚Äô USA whether want not. hope works, cos there‚Äôs gonna dark months ahead.

It didn‚Äôt like btw. Real recognize real us good immune responses flu descendants Spanish Flu people didn‚Äôt died, plague. high portion people European descent genes help fight instances wasn‚Äôt really ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù way it‚Äôs discussed news. plain old natural selection. 

Like COVID think type blood worse. Maybe herd immunity would make super rare.

But past examples basically part massive wave death. Hopefully section supporters wear start wearing them. would surprised K-12 schooling become almost fully online within next 10-20 years.

""prove China superpower leadership, authority, organization get rid virus testing, shutdowns, contact tracing.""

I buy this, think anyone could imagined America would handled badly. quite risk infect country chance countries would fuck bad.

Also realise yes China bounce back, impossible China self sustaining, need rest world operational function properly. makes zero sense done purpose. Zero.

Edit. ""THEN create vaccine dominate everyone financially.""

Also China already said vaccine global common good, dominating anyone financially this. 3000 dollar escape reality escape see masks every US state dozens tv stations air several hours news each.

In Miami-Dade, Broward, Orange counties, three counties hurt worst (so far) DeSantis policies, many voted DeSantis.

The rural areas Florida voted DeSantis felt much pain (relatively) COVID-19 (yet). really, really annoying much power governor Florida represents minority voters. I've met Hungarians would fit mold perfectly. cis guy randomly died testosterone balls.

Like think they're injecting people HRT? Mercury? Yep. I‚Äôve come opinion don‚Äôt need politicians. big changes come up, put ballot let popular vote decide. Nothing gets done federal government except stalling shit out. Let CDC remain federally funded, speak without control anyone something like this. Let military run military, leader don‚Äôt understand enough, assume promoted within. Let Supreme Court stand alone, without partisan control. politicians state absolutely nothing make mess. city mayor? Yes. need county state? Let city mayors county form council. course speak act together cities state, separate, disjointed groups? group looking one direction. they‚Äôre taking payouts working behalf rich.

I know rant many holes, giant nightmare pandemic, absolutely risk reward president. much power, much push, much damage. minus checks balances promised. Street riders?

Oof. friend college admissions counselor, specific purpose within office travel internationally recruit international students. far college given idea international students come fall still job, yeah, inability travel internationally going hurt lot people. They're ""special"" states mostly. Still nowhere near 100,000 tests. Ya countries freedumb quibble deniers claim greater 99% survival. unless truly getting better identifying even minimal symptoms hard time getting reasonable estimate.

And we're it.....death count could low too. spread expected actual mortality assuming ""official"" covid deaths accurate.

World wide still seeing 3% CFR. 

They also completely forget survival rate written stone tablet Jeebus...or whoever

A multimillionaire afford hospital likely survive. least likely Joe Medicaid. Joe Medicaid really Schmidt's Creek town's hospital ICU beds full.

Statistics exact branch math. No, statistics truly lie liars selectively use statistics (with deference Mark Twain).

But statistics implies complete information. think do. least complete diseases like influenza. Well, except COVID-19 infect people private school too. Remember fears e h p n e l s? Yet, folks opposed A.C.A. operating states overrun COVID doctors choose receives care not. Thank you! Private gatherings huge driver this. mentioned Reddit need stop going family barbecues summer **people acted like said disown family**. visit people one time. Outside. possibility getting 17 family members sick horrible outcome compared getting sick visiting one person couple. many stories hear graduation parties infect entire family several people hospitalized? 

People stubborn give anything voluntarily. literally would make illegal visit mom order make sure host graduation party.

People want freedom act like children. limits much freedom give 11yo child. people acted like adults choose strong measures harsh enforcement vs letting people die. Keep mind traffic accidents still happen bad time need hospitalization. Compared four last Sunday. increase moving average nearly twelve 62. Following trend line deaths would put us around 400 desserts today we'll hit first 1k+ day Tuesday around 1200..

Edit - desserts swypo deaths, find funny stay. Authoritarians gonna authoritarian Yeah workers protested open, wonder many complain they're sick. right. can't selfish, right? RIGHT???? Still tells awful entire education system is. sure students expected learning right things many years schooling many more. Guys, joking. Stop downvotes I'd love see graph much delay-corrected estimate final numbers diverge, historical data regarding estimates. Perhaps start taking weekly screenshots.

Regarding lifting lockdowns, get much on/off decision. selectively, e.g. including particular cities counties regarding particular measures. could conclude measures effective, e.g. keeping schools closed, not, applying entire countries. 

Regarding deaths youngest age bracket, interesting small consistent decline past years. Pneumonia particular Florida cases per day NYC peak. drug tests cannabis? seats remain empty. well tbf playing bubble, one leave getting tested regularly. lot safer bubble part country.  #pardonthevirus would anyone want pretend American? going say time recall DiSantis, can‚Äôt recall Governor. stuck another 2 1/2 years

Meanwhile anti-mask protests kind wonder someone know got covid gotten this, still recovering. got around March, even though healthy 40 year old ended hospital. don‚Äôt remember neeeded ventilated anything definitely sick. got even testing negative still could think clearly, wouldn‚Äôt make much sense talking, trouble remembering basic things. Even now, still extremely run part probably stuck bed week, it‚Äôs scary. used run 5+ miles everyday, struggles get function normally. read time ago Covid-19 HIV like features (like infecting T-lymphocytes). Maybe could vector attacking again? I'm also Florida. week, I've seen hardly anyone wearing masks makes terrified go take care things (go pharmacy doctors) say week sightly better terms seeing folks wear masks little more.

I hate governor right though many local leaders enough. I've done research. sure think believe wearing mask helps help. never mentioned anything that. trust Fauci. make things worse unusually cold year, timing all. actually people government structured. mean makes sense. One person get several people sick knowing sick. feel like numbers would multiply. think people posted /r/dataisbeautiful back. ""Lowest since March"" pretty low bar. governor Florida officials disregarded safety people favor opening economy receive harshest punishment! Complete failure protect citizens!! losing friendship cost nothing, would say try, takes mounting peer pressure people change behaviour, sometimes every little push adds up. would know? Keep mind New York shut 2 weeks prior peak. Meanwhile, Florida re-opened disney world... American mean believe country superior every one, mean continue support current administration running ground, means loving country make sure best everyone. American fail see faults flaws. Yea that's great point 4th I've several close friends self quarantining contracted virus...

2/3 roommates went boat fishing trip yesterday together...to fair theh left straight dock still mind blown lack care situation. Thank link. spreads, people get it, others become infected. can't assume fixed rate growth. feel like point living anymore. COVID never get control America. point going college?

There's great amount delusion this. I've also never felt like anti-capitalist now. university might survive financially open. open. expense endangering everyone's lives. exact sort situation state federal government step help economic burden needing close.

The hospital census also obviously full, discharging 400-500+ patients per day otherwise. Anyone think go home going home. Serious question: US test soldiers deployment countries? mean, White House staff visitors get tested *all time.* number presented close reality possible. Every single death tragedy.

Or think laws made cater whatever group threatens violence? sounds like one super terrific society. can‚Äôt wait Bill defrag hard drive. Deaths usually actually lag month, sometimes even more. People dying today probably got infected 3-4 weeks ago. initial intuition self isolation August, back February everyone work scoffed me. current intuition wfh, masks, social distancing here, official sense, next 2-5 years. really depends lot election goes development treatment/vaccine. 

For personally, part really sucks impact daughter born start April.

Common question

Do masks protect coronavirus disease?

Face masks protect COVID-19. much important wash hands properly avoid touching face eyes. Specific types face masks protect health professionals looking people virus. I‚Äôve never masks, believe time place.""

I take thinks belong hospital, malls grocery stores? Also, forget financial impact.  \~100,000 Florida's desperately ramping testing. MASK CASKET honestly word stupidity doesnt justice least florida time absolutely retarded, there‚Äôs link two correlation data. Correlation causation. Maybe covid caused happen doesn‚Äôt mean related. actually said likes makes look like Lone Ranger. Unemployment 15%. Quarantines effect months. You‚Äôre describing essential workers.

Rut Row time... wonder sheep follow? tell he's brilliant stable genius even considering power move like wearing mask shame also saw, David Muir last night, dancers line something looked like jumping jacks singing without masks, course.. yeah going go well. continue increase leadership absent. I'm somewhat confused relatively low death/1mil rate US. lower UK example? European countries higher death/1mil population less overall infections. explained testing rates?

	Per 1 million population:
	USA 
	Cases 10209
	Deaths 416
	Tests 126804

	UK
	Cases 4265
	Deaths 660
	Tests 173531

	Spain
	Cases 6438
	Deaths 607
	Tests 122651 I'm right now. 105 degrees, maybe 1:10 wearing masks, I've almost rear ended 3 times read article? deliberately silent day-to-day data, numbers getting better.

They publishing ""last 7 days"" data people would think over: ""a misleading impression coronavirus threat past, could encourage people behave recklessly"".

The numbers fine, Spain counting previous 7 days instead day day, make sure people get idea over.

If brit too, please note entire continent laughing lot. He's like Texas-produced textbook. Florida open fuck. live like there's nothing going on, wild Uh......I mean it‚Äôs probably time panic. hospitals fill people start dying home  Angry conservative whites.

lol way prove rate possible Florida going bad NY was, crazy due differences population density fact Florida months clear indications would happen take decisive action know that‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying.

When Florida becomes overwhelmed, Arizona, texas states like Cali Alabama far behind states way. exactly going travel places help states far behind?

I'm UK I'm worried guys. someone runs business spent lot time setting protections staff ultimately guests. incredibly disheartening see people view pandemic here.

I cant even thoughtfully write anything Arizona that's absolutely stupid here. leaders failed us. person smart, people stupid. guys *really* want over, you?

That's today. would take President tell it‚Äôs serious put mask, god forbid something save lives rather please voting base. cost they're shifting employees? hope boss man reimburses chair.

I understand grieving friendly virus give shit that. I‚Äôll probably get tested day get home self monitor. outbreak going comments like tend look like minimizing situation even that's intention.

I believe Dr. Michael Osterholm podcast said countries managing well positive rate something like 1-2 per 100k. 10%+ still awful even less awful days before. Compared what? Disneyworld open longer shows. It‚Äôs nothing.

Now understand people pay price go? not, go take Econ class. people described get vaccine? mean? DeSantis shown remarkable leadership! one else could built quickly many express exit ramps God‚Äôs waiting room. /s video posted flock Karens that. planned, choreographed sequence. insanely stupid.

Oh gotcha, true  Wrong numbers: diagnose people walking phenomena  organize. Fat chance happen, we're fucking divided here. Seriously. could argue missed signs China China lied. could also argue missed signs Italy Spain continent. god damn it, pandemic HERE, US soil, NYC like 3 months ago!! Yet still missed opportunities.

Look I'm wearing mask. Right? mom keeps trying get drive 500 miles see her, several friends mine taken vacations driven. don‚Äôt get it. Listen, lied every day. Like dang time. Mostly people indifferent actual malice. People high-level positions actually lie you. Accept that.

Fauci lying prevent bum rush masks based reason. given happened toilet paper, hand sanitizer, Lysol wipes, yeast, paper towels, microwave meals, canned veggies, bleach, 100 commercial products *he absolutely right so*. absolutely nothing suggest people would somehow seen need restraint area. People bought much fuckmothering hand sanitizer started converting breweries bolster production. way people stripped shelves deprived medical personnel needed support.

But really drill this: everyone sucked. thousands doctors, hundreds researchers, decade half policy acting barricade something like this. systematically disassembled firings, funding reallocations, project closures.

You mad Fauci lied, mad Fauci lie, enact triage entire country. can't accept led dreadful algebra necessity. live marine corps base. They‚Äôre requiring masks worn public places, don‚Äôt wear gym chow halls...and still huge PTs formations one caring social distancing etc. Congestive heart failure.

Yeah, sounds like realistic scenario, especially days intervention limited. understand youngest adults might feel invincible (although excuse lack regard older people), cannot fathom pandemic people 30s older also feeling invincible.

So bad all.  residuals difference observed values predicted values. good model show residuals scattered randomly around horizontal axis residual plot without patterns. example, see quadratic pattern residual plot, means current model appropriate non-linear model may better fit.

What concerns OP‚Äôs result overfitting. OP addressed using AIC, model many variables may still bad thing. addition, sure sin tanh functions fit predicting number total cases (maybe modeling zigzag pattern new cases due weekends initial curve flattening?) functions cannot well-explained many variables catch everything, usually means model sake fitting observed data Tulsa. want soldiers recognize start demanding fucking explanations.....

Unless happen 80+ years old diabetes kidney issues, chance dying serious complications slim. Well looks better...let's try face mask next time Last saw, CDC estimating 0.26% mortality rate, i.e., 26 people 10,000 *who contract virus* die. Essentially, believe 10x many people actually virus tested positive... 10 Million infected, 260,000 dead, 0.26% mortality rate.

Digging number shows well 1% people 80 (who account half total deaths), drops significantly lower people 70 80 (responsible 1/4 deaths), drops *again* significantly (below 0.26% average) people 60 70 (accounting another 1/8th total deaths), falls nearly zero people 60 (who total make remaining 1/8th total deaths).

At average rate, everybody entire country got it, would mean 900 thousand deaths. those, 675 thousand would elderly, i.e., 70 years old.

But hey... delaying deaths hundred thousand seniors *plenty* reason destroy economy, right? mean... it'll probably recover generation two... (Assuming one sneezes) Yes does, said initially would used limited number children.

It worked UK. That's it. wager bet, I‚Äôm pretty sure Trump would prefer flaunt pardon power soothe fragile ego. I‚Äôd also bet exhaustive behest senior staff agree drop Friday night news dump, really microcosm entire ‚Äúreign.‚Äù I'll happy admit I'm wrong provide link video, ss. take look online, find one.

Look, despise guy, mainly facts truth kind important me. Debbie Downer tell 4chan, Simpsons. varies wildly depending amount damage done cytokine storm. Recovery take 6+ months. Wonder NHL MLB testing queues country. seems might benefit identifying outwardly affected virus. asymptomatic people labeled pre would suggest symptoms coming, never do. Look pneumonia deaths. Covid deaths falsely reported deaths fudge numbers. someone please legally anything it?  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* reason numbers low changed way report numbers. read started chaging reporting right protests downplay impact.

Edit: changed way count presumptive cases. also count separate positive test new case. Even person. doesn't, far undercounting cases deaths. 

IFR probably generally within range 1% spread broadly across age demographics. sun belt overwhelmed enough hospitals next could much higher side range. 

""99% survival rate"" may roughly true, here's really means: potentially millions dead US. Already 0.28% NY dead months. population, infected. Towns Bergamo 1.56% population died two months. survivors, many still suffering damage.

Most US infected, we've still seen well 137k deaths last four months.   sure, average 50k tests per day, 99k today 

Not big jump see anything hearing that.

Still good though appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* ‚ÄúGet shit together Indonesia!‚Äù

SLC far best place I've mask wearing. I've basically every state except Maine Florida since covid started. SLC everybody mask went Walmart truckstop staying at. (I'm trucker).

California expected great....and wasn't. worse southern states. think lot cases, freshmen want ""college experience,"" realize going get whether universities open back not. 

It's sad, already lost best part senior year - final weeks parties, social events. something tells today's young people future's ""walked school uphill ways snow"" generation, much patience whiners. sites visit best click Yesterday's result since Today's usually complete, sort New Cases.

I guess Mississippi bad others mentioned, still great. starting see July 4th weekend data now, going increase cases everywhere. recent study puts asymptomatic people cause nearly half infections country. changing landscape know much. accept humility strive make best situation beyond me. Americans misunderstanding rights. rights, right thing entirely different. Often, overlap, like right now.  Thanks! 

I mostly wondered making catchy song means official communication anywhere else idea. Dirty 530 slashdot old tried true what-used-to-be news aggregator website.  reddit hug death, websites got slashdotted. equally valuable though, old foagie precedent would overwhelmingly agree  late thing reddit going ability completely cut political content following it. It‚Äôs hard cut completely possible. Facebook it‚Äôs face cause friends. Highest death rate? blind see what's happen southern states? Like wow... completely delusional. Better question CEO going golf course everyday. Downvoted asking question. Woo lad. think need read wrote little closer. I'm attacking state, pockets Arizona casually racist white people I've ever encountered. Fox News basically religion among people parents' retirement community.  currently one highest exponential growth rates world COVID it.

(I typed bed 5pm Sunday) Thank much!

It really unfortunate chose disclose results participants. help boost participation rate, skew data toward people suspected may sick. Holy shit. else say this? shattering records still fuck fight virus governmental level. seems like people care thousands lives lost due virus. know systemic racism US. think they've already got bigger problem tackle people virus shed asymptomatic presymptomatic? article indicate that. would normally agree rural America much worse health urban America.

They gonna MASSIVE death toll, Trump‚Äôs base.

As result, think actually lose. really think people keep thinking behind. are, would equally behind.

Don't touch I'm real live wire crazy two days Florida new cases Japan start thing. Florida total population 21M.

Of course we're still figuring means, immunity virus guarantee.  Worth also noting we're 41st 50 states comes tests per capita... we're fucked know likely. pointed before, we've got several thousand _definitely mysterious_ pneumonia deaths standard past 30 years so... things far worse numbers telling us It‚Äôs entirely possible. 5/20, 20% NYC antibodies- roughly 2m people got within 75 day period.

The people flocking Disney aren‚Äôt wholly Floridians place hot spot every asshole thinks virus cancelled coming vacation thanks DeSantis.

I flew IL FL 2 weeks ago. plane almost full, half people masks worn incorrectly. weren‚Äôt Floridians returning home, vacationers.

If Floridian blame, it‚Äôs mostly DeSantis. care showing characters‚Äô faces performers‚Äô safety. guess figured they‚Äôd safe enough they‚Äôre kept separate guests. Nevermind performers could infect other. sounds safe. understand Texas surging. living safely taking precautions. /S gonna happen. still slipping through. Gotta catch em all. boo'd said, boo'd is.

Same thing Trump Leftists, they'll boo even he's right (which like 80% time he's dude informed smart people). cotton masks sufficient considering admits aerosol transmission? bought Amazon, three layers thin cotton.

They fine general use. live NYC 0 issues wearing simple cotton bandana general outdoor/grocery store/subway use. switch surgical mask indoors prolonged period time. 

I would use n95 respirator I'm somewhere like airplane cabin setting would exposed lot people indoors. spreads spreads suffering great, changes people's behavior. That's... that's endgame, without federal coordination. That's it.  Think need give due rights infected coronavirus. http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_reports_latest.pdf

are even looking data all? hope recovers quickly! equate seeing movie attending covid party. Thank informing opinion worthless.

Have good day. cell data doesn‚Äôt support hypothesis people infected COVID develop protection it. 70k cases Daily did, sooo... Wondering too. Can't find anything online, tho see various people claiming something close. thing think multi-stage vaccine. Ulster county here. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs 95% mask compliant inside stores. I‚Äôm disappointed California‚Äôs progress regress. Additionally Europe way denser making spreading super easy. course makes sense, thoughts, best luck speedy recovery.  Interesting. probably shouldn‚Äôt said Canada then.

I could take video right Toronto you‚Äôd impressed masks. coronavirus doesn‚Äôt kill makes entire body weaker illnesses field day you... 

Not good Let's go Disney World celebrate !!! - Natural selection finest !!! Yes, social aspect seems often ignored here. folks enjoyed lockdown, 99% co-workers, including myself, damned miserable. Universal masks social distancing get-go would solved many problems.  we'd leader ""everyone page"" message....it's sad. economic death spiral, joblessness, illness deaths...all numbers could mitigated get vaccine out. enough make cry. it'll likely mess years, decade. Putin smiling somewhere.

I sure glad this, brings solace. Putin probably quite concerned hold power though, covid raging russia. Russia heavily manipulates media, still reporting 200 deaths day half population. said meat processing plants originally asshat. said ways procure food. could even grow vegetables!!! Whoa! Crazy concept right? dont ship anywhere grow yourself, fucking diseased taint licker.  Stop hoping DeSantis mask mandate, won't. person protect families. state help you, fed govt help you, protect yourself.

We nation missed chance contain this. hoax, ploy, flu. 

Get Facebook, open eyes see yourself, shit hit fan. Kanye, answer  here... there‚Äôs 80 us one gives shit masks, meetings, etc. working home 2 times week feel like I‚Äôm pushing CEO doesn‚Äôt believe agree. Correlation causation. 

I would think loss jobs probably relevant. thing got statement is, ""I'm White developed first-world country, make sense Malaysia better us.""

Get ethnocentrism probably racism. many believe Florida worse NYC was.  personally believe yet much better testing.  believe period thought 10% cases officially diagnosed. assume much better now. rate catch soon. Cuomo leading nation wide COVID response. need consistent set rules whole country. State state governance works almost everything America built work pandemic. need federal level mandates. totally agree, honestly believe taking child away worthy punishment? fine? ticket? 14 day house arrest? Lets go straight taking child away right? thats insane. People would rather cruel unusual punishment create actual solution punishment fits crime. turn away people time without mask, im gonna call CPS child taken away. cases, yes, although may also transfer ossuary. Good job NY. Sadly, 2 words you: Fall. School. can't tell 15k today cases earlier week least ONE people tested positive going Disney could correct go federal guidelines? Sounds like could stopped hundreds deaths think anyone count students

Literally employer prefer someone 2019 degree someone ""COVID degree."" ~~i understand means implies though. give test to? trend signify?~~

thanks edit discharged ER oxygen tanks advised worsen, come back. Testing 6k less average 

Folks Arizona reporting takes weeks get test results back Florida new China ""can't trust data!"" No, that's restructuring works.

Also realize company typically entity. could hundred prosperous companies one that's floundering. one floundering company could still file bankruptcy despite almost rest portfolio making record breaking money. chance re-write legibly? call ambulance stroke? described company exactly. Eventually put us rotations decreed must wear mask desk. think kicked someone's puppy way acting. ordered one, thank mean ? implying voted oaf? seems kind strange plan stopped working still want change it. would apply government individual sport leagues conferences florida hand... :/ read FL 15K daily cases. read AZ 2K thought ""Well that's bad"".

So yeah, we're getting numb Yes, think unfortunately people need firsthand experience snap BS mindset understand really marching into... afraid late then... seeing outcomes mild cases Arizona due effects 110+ heat. virus weakened extreme heat, studies proven that. majority cases stay mild.

Also, patients recovering faster. Viruses hard time extreme heat humans do, more.

I COVID don‚Äôt long lasting effects. health issues people saying this, one critical cases. wasn‚Äôt. 

I still wear balaclava face got out, still socially distance go out. go work supplies. still responsible interactions.

Wear mask. Brooklyn saw 2 town people luggage get Lyft masks....please keep vigilance. used live there, shocking me. AZ filled chest puffing types instantly jump ""my rights!"" bandwagon thinking masks liberal ploy. proud listen common sense. mother consistently wore mask, often said many people around also 1945 like tend look like minimizing situation even that's intention.

I think error 10%+ still awful even less awful days before

its going take time results show up. Fl close bars June 26th, would expect see impact one. Much information study needed....but least possibility noise data. I‚Äôm Vancouver Island minimal mask wearing, everybody stayed home like 2 months fortunately there‚Äôs around 3 new cases week point. astounding though see coming long time ago. good kill voters?? DeSantis needs punched throat thrown office point. incompetent fuck Let's go Disney! I'm even American shit makes mad. would ANYONE choose go fucking Disney World time? people really self-centered? fuck even open first place? many questions... could wrong reporting lags. People realize reporting deaths lags. Right, vegetables process ship right? Maybe look big picture friend. De Blasio kept bars open. saw happened Italy still delayed.

There outbreak town near NYC everyone commutes city, bit take sign spreading city itself.

There ample evidence ignored, crazy people still defend Cuomo objectively highest death rate get it. went back office 3 weeks ago. go office shut door. different home. somehow better?

Excuse like focus positives. There‚Äôs far much negativity going right now, focus upsides.

In cases daily reported deaths dropped half yesterday‚Äôs reported deaths. Half! That‚Äôs huge! 

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll focus real fact Death reporting usually light weekends due administrative hurdles, Sunday Monday reports cover weekends always bit light, that‚Äôs focusing negatives again, one won‚Äôt succumb negativity.

No casualties, injuries, damage property. 

I'd say thats pretty damn peaceful. 

Also protests supposed intimidating, werent they'd easy ignore. whole point show large mass people supporting something whatever theyre supporting youre thats pretty damn intimidating. 

Finally clarify support either protests. support protests principal thats another matter. perfect for-profit healthcare system.

People think ""Don't bring politics X"" naive idiots play right hands dirtiest political fighters.

EVERYTHING political, long laws govern daily lives. 

Politics guide school opening decisions. scientists counteract business political machines want ignore science.

If give wiggle room, politicians, public large ignore it. **C**all 
**A**nd 
**R**eport 
**E**pidemic 
**N**egligence  think still significant drop death rate cases going bit, long rate deaths increasing significantly slower rate cases increasing. 

So...

definitely early told so. *of a* sudden

Sorry Pretty sure she‚Äôs always mouth breather, based arguments üòÇ getting using masks best things jobs economy getting open quicker. Keeping people healthy save ton medical costs bankruptcies emotional trauma well.

[Everyone wearing face masks could save America $1 trillion GDP loss] Right seemes say mild asymptomatic symptoms chances incredibly low. statement initially factually incorrect due language used. like USA moment? businesses closed? people showing concern, people distancing wearing masks? Canada people stopped, still maintain moderately good distancing. That's thinking. complete bubble safer us. We'll see. organized saying this. Ohio 55k cases close amount death florida 225k cases. Florida must amazing Dr‚Äôs also testing WAAAAYYYY people March. March, catching severe cases, catching mild stay home cases plus asymptomatics via contact tracing. C'mon man, take modicum personal responsibility shitty life choices. lot us telling everybody US would end moving towards Swedish strategy.


It's originally planned ALWAYS GOING HAPPEN. seeing lot people wearing them. excuse leader seen wild wearing one. Surely lot supporters look him.... call surely early order happened yanking? Well, Disneyland open

Edit: Disney World Disneyland headline doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúasymptomatic people [be] spreading infections‚Äù. 

It says ‚ÄúAsymptomatic **and presymptomatic** people transmit COVID-19 infections‚Äù. hope contagious virus ""Years get vaccine""? 

you find vaccine safe, works, manufacture distribute it. goign dive knowing long term safety effectiveness, still going take long time manufacture billions doses. guy wrong literally every interaction I've him. Ignore him. would interpret this? another option mentioned comment, vaccine part? slashdot == news nerds; stuff matters would still mean skipping phase. Flattened? data source seen on? husband uses [this one. we‚Äôre pre diabetic before? Asking relative Exponential growth üòÇüòÇüòÇ sure commander chief likes low numbers testing. even help can't go anywhere escape since seems like everywhere badly. worse others.


Not live New York. Rates incredibly low. Neighboring states, like NJ, south eastern PA (Philadelphia), Mass, Connecticut, DC... Everything fine. also allowed building without mask, bars restaurants allowed serve indoors, people actively practice social distancing, governors basing guidelines advice public health leadership.

Compare South... Florida, instance, posted 10% positive test rate (!!!), also allowing Disney World open.

I told friend thinking relocating, time. works remotely go anywhere, landlords desperate tenants willing accommodate anything, like 6 month leases whatever. 

No reason keep living death trap leadership equipped deal going on. ‚ÄúbUt He‚ÄôS ReAl sCiEnTiSt‚Äù

Yes that‚Äôs experiment simple anyone understand don‚Äôt believe him... Apparently get post-COVID shit even asymptomatic. Yes. It‚Äôs rare. Didn‚Äôt read paper information? not, wtf using stay informed? 

Your feelings? 

Enough anti-science bent sub. Jesus. Florida Sweden Nordic coubtries 8? Wow states 4. bad feeling this. son graduated (class 2020) we‚Äôre wait year (or more?) there‚Äôs handle virus vaccine starting college. I‚Äôd rather safe sorry. Good luck stay healthy! ü§ûüèª sounds like family. There's 5 us. got extremely sick early March, fine april May, bed ridden June. us. wife recovered June 1 sickness. feel desaturate everyday now. buy herd immunity put coins it. Georgia didnt let public get tested 4/20, there's probably lots people sick April got sick June/July can't confirm reinfection testing available first sickness. going take third infection healthcare document 2 them. say September I'll violently ill again, then, reinfection common masks. Agreed completely consumer economy whether tourism, hospitality, sports, music, arts, culture, food etc

UBI May way forward ridiculous place reading Florida numbers today seems low. long Florida continues shattering records dumb governors feel good totally brain dead policies.

Covid-19 longer killing us. virus stupidity finally totally come incubation link testing metrics Arizona. Looks like might plateau total tests, also percentage positive tests seems leveling See, I'd way rather manage computer. Timestamps, logs, screenshots, shared drives... fucking accountability! problem arises look hard data determine when/where/who responsible. masks infringement rights, pants, shirts, even shoes? different masks makes people angry, yet problem pants shirts shoes?

Honest question - could someone kindly explain I'm missing question seems obvious me? Yes. Even though concept contact tracking important worthwhile, almost certainty liberties taken GOOD. covid. 

It happened patriot act. would million deaths day doubters budge little. They‚Äôre going believe anything yeah people could weakness, heard gonna check people regularly. hope works out. Oh god, got nothing? stats death dont indicate died purely covid nitwit, means tested positive died. slice wrist open bleed covid they'll count covid death. That's point. point thing spreading like wildfire mortality rate trending STATS SHOW, cares spreads?
It's easy feel smart ignore every hole poke argument. Holy shit. 6-foot recommendation mask without. forgetting summer heat Florida, everywhere else Sun Belt. Everyone inside air conditioning. got BS mechanical engineering Cornell. invented hydraulic resonance suppressor tube used 747's. moral anything hinky going body, get tested. Covid symptoms anything everything unusual. Probably another Putin‚Äôs propaganda initiatives. What's net worth? money made trying screw people U.S. can't even afford *insulin need survive*, give back? Something tells he's still okay..... gets make *even money* writing books revealing information gained acting like greedy sociopath. nothing admire here. Tell lives modestly, donates book proceeds excess median annual salary something like that, maybe I'll start change mind.

So people defending him, what, exactly, lesson want rest us take away this? ""It's okay selfish jerk, long say sorry later!"" standards really sunk low?  Chile low death rate too. Turned deaths counted right people started complaining lead minister health replaced 7k deaths 11k count probable deaths too. Might case too. knows. gotten reaction tell people wear mask around parents siblings/their spouses. ""But wearing mask around family?...they're family."" Um I'm pretty sure virus know I'm related people. Since none us know live house makes sense wear mask. Seven day rolling average deaths gone 48 last week 73 (52% growth) one week. saying report, even suspicious official numbers cannot cover bad trends now. Almost State going lockdown again. anybody tries guarantee last long. 

That over. Especially Fed Unemployment running 2 weeks city State survive lockdown again. Effective maybe, safe nope. Nothing 100%. Everything talking statistical probabilities. low humidity aerosol viral particles build even outside stay air hours enough infected people become dangerously dense outside. Indoor air movement, also much human density public areas combined aerosol transmission (air conditioning lowers humidity allowing particles stay aloft) dangerous. 

Btw, notice science gets voted thread. Politics get voted up. Yep. US lot people feel symptoms, get tested. lot return positive states. Europe, lot people feel COVID symptoms, thus lot tests done. get tested (mostly symptoms) come back negative. shows virus almost disappeared Europe. we've seen time time virus need lot flair up, can't lower guard virus. I‚Äôm getting mail-in ballot, to, would walk COVID positive person coughing directly face, meant got vote.

This shit joke, president needs outed. virus EASY beat. Unfortunately, nearly impossible beat given society economies currently structured. truth is, one willing modify either things save lives. 

It's like climate change... solvable problem (or least was), one really wants necessary. fucking time  think I'm confrontational, I've got real bad news son referring immunocompromised humans? 

Then that's *you.* we're talking statistics I'm pretty sure understood we're talking overall statistics. 

&amp;#x200B;

If immunocompromised mention post, otherwise seems like worried small statistic. links available? I'd love look those. 0 328.2 million. idiots think joke Germany well. I'm glad government give shit though made masks mandatory places like supermarkets.

Turns hopes, thoughts prayers, well wishes don‚Äôt change biology science. would guessed? Imagine spike summer schools closed months... wanting students go back classrooms again. initial death rates US high begin US failed detect majority cases.

Presently official mortality rate around 4-5% 130k deaths 3 million.

But CDC admitted number infected actually closer 20 million. 

So real death rate around 1/10 that, aligning East Asia seeing. Indeed, best performing country regard - Singapore, like 20 deaths 40,000 mortality rate 0.05%.

So what‚Äôs going happen America infect remaining 280 million citizens haven‚Äôt gotten Covid yet. US isn‚Äôt Singapore hospitals overflow, 0.5% higher die.

Total death toll thus probably hit 1.4-2.8 million, every war entire history US combined. ok ....dudette public walk hospital? public. Right. always break legs after. üòÇ  JFK meddled Afghanistan's elections. Agree things bad US. negate bad Mexico. Thanks complete response thought legitimate question since lingering effects seem commonly seen among widespread viruses like flu, although clearly community disagrees. appreciate taking time reply. heads up...beware feeding claim healthcare worker FL somehow time post 50-100 times day hours end awful CA is.

Funny though wife works dental office lockdown started office closed grabbed handful surgical masks figured we'd need shopping w.e. actually thought handful masks basically we'd need. like three boxes kitchen one setup like paper towel dispenser bathroom ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Florida also weeks behind , deaths seeing reported today actually end June reported verified. verification process takes weeks. article really seem clear mention manufacturing California Vancouver, may right. 3 countries something common people saying Florida ""fudging"" numbers.

What GA? Deaths decline.

Don't say Republicans.

NC Democratic Governor---their cases hospitalizations steadily increasing TWO MONTHS.

Deaths budged.

So NC hiding deaths too? upvoted? Simply doomerism? 

We weren‚Äôt testing March. NY 100 times better spot right was. think author‚Äôs actual opinion case almost certainly confirms reinfection possible subsequent reinfections may worse. That‚Äôs issue with.

We debate whether used word ‚Äúconclusion‚Äù original comment, shown explained great detail think flawed article. position, made clear, people aware it‚Äôs clear patient tested positive twice. Authorities far unable trace source infection 13 38 new confirmed cases Unfortunately, desserts people infected fellow citizens careless. long hit 30K? actually one uplifting thing Duceys last presser (although came Dr. Christ). Totally common sense practically way maximize care provided. actual number though? lot untested cases getting diagnosed death Leukemia places like Florida. urge control uptick data prevent change business political agendas. People don‚Äôt want panic. money base pumps economy makes complaints seem small. 

From strictly economic outlook. 

Things complicated course.

Edit: Pumps local economy. comment Japan pays US rent. rent money would magically go local businesses US left. local businesses Okinawa recieve revenue stationed base. lot businesses would close. USA get shit together. Kick Orange joke president Office something. force someone least Competence handle situation better him. Even pro Trump people recognize shitshow help anybody. context, entire country Italy 13,000 remaining active cases \*in total\* people talking ass, troops PCSing new station whether seas 2 weeks quarentine test base base basis. seas stations test show symptoms quarentine. 

Dont talk shit push political view fucks.


EDIT:Since said must come back add travel 0% exposure (government travel like military planes) outside world may required quarentine stateside. Regardless overseas dont think get it.

Unfortunately, japan pays usa.  meh, matter  Fall Winter indeed catastrophe way worse Spring. seems pawn game chess literally representation foot soldier. Soldiers pawns. Thats meaning word. That‚Äôs exactly they‚Äôre signing for. CDC always weeks behind. release excess deaths excel format.

[Here puts easy view graph. 

Florida approximately 500 excess deaths per week 2 weeks ago. 2020 exciting time alive. Trump promised vaccine / autumn 2020. Better days coming, chile. I'm back work flying Atlanta San Diego every week. Looking getting extended stay place San Diego cut travel exposure, got signed yet.

Not ideal wish choice matter. Really dont want get Covid. post lie, title completely contradicts actual study. 

This reason people call sub biggest spreader covid misinformation world. Probably parallel ‚Äò6 feet under‚Äô... AZ population 7 (7.28)  many many people ability think less him......i know can't. Thank you! live post-sarcasm world. Onion gone business flat earthers roam land plenty. Leave empty added level distance comfort. Way crammed are. Firstly, bad things americans done Okinawa recent history? military scandals?

Secondly, good time launch attack lol? I'm looking Iran. Really? what's hate for? Disney actually better theme parks? :') Ockham‚Äôs razor says first test falsely positive. really need data draw conclusion near one doctor advocates. game athletes get chronic fatigue syndrome result covid IIRC, also due fear everyone stuck home 30+ days, allowed go store certain date. stocked prior, could wake next day order truly remain home next however many days. Assumption: everyone wearing mask HAHAHAHAHAHA,

This 'merica, rest world. Get shotty math here. dont think airlines require masks. funniest part whole thing quickly people use feel superior others. last time checked healthy skepticism rather following Uncle like sheep immensely healthy. listen idea, can't comprehend maybe wrong. know people saying results taking long. Myself, others know waited 30min test results. also seen believe strand going transmittable mutated going around EU, I'll see find article.

Edit: article transmittable, possibly less deadly could lucky happens Florida stays Florida. Anyone evicts someone right POS. believe shit everyone keeps posting landlords needing rent money pay mortgage. No, don't. fucking stupid. landlord, sort savings. something breaks rent house, landlord responsible fixing it. also responsible taxes house. Rent house also stable income. People lose jobs, stop paying it, go months without tenant. 

Anyone makes seem like landlord living paycheck paycheck full shit. majority ones know another job. Rent extra money them. subtract one day next get number readily available (I'm assuming somewhere dive deep enough).

i understand math though. crazy considering Japan culture respect, accountability, humility, USA culture of, ""I'm queen living best life can't tell do!"" Strike anyway, idea teacher‚Äôs strike even illegal fucking nuts, especially considering poorly treated. know long people telling expect spike deaths? Since April yet correlation cases deaths low meaning many people dying get it. going comments thread underrated hahaha think expected cater needs/interests something politician them. Coal miners thought he'd get jobs back, racists thought he'd get rid brown people, scorched earthers wanted government failing fail could replaced something new. 

So, anyone thought Trump would anything anyone's self interest trumps self interest lying themselves.  paid attention behavior, fairly obvious empathy cared zilch anyone except self. Lets zombie apocalypses start Plus reporting tends drop weekend- Monday see another spike. 100k next.

At point Trump forced either start something step down? complete inaction complacency top cannot continue... living science fiction dystopia.

THINK CHILDREN wisconsin? lot ppl wearing mask dane county though. actually seen stories younger heavily muscled guy really bad outcomes made wonder steroids negative effect. One factor - Florida state income tax. earns money people spending, staying hotels, eating out. state shuts extensively, tax revenue drops damn near zero. Two specialists Chinese capital weekend talk terms bigger mission origins Much depend much access investigators given data laboratory Wuhan, observers say got downvoted saying got twice. Tests available first illness. Never sick longer 4 days life entire family damn near hospitalized twice 3 months. also see opposite side. guess different experiences since us live different places probably different exposure media. considering that, feel tjat media coverage vaccines often falls excessive optimimism, even uncertain wether vaccine short term ever. creating fake hopes cruel opinion, ina situation like one, also irresponsible lol, never gets old countries troops stationed countries :D. there's reason furious first place, guess... 

but yeah, corona too. don‚Äôt know Arizona attest happened mother-in-law lives California Inland Empire area. is, however, otherwise fine home week point symptoms. would still mean skipping phase! ain't testing safety, running phase 3! would claim deaths made fake media. people hopeless. numbers seem line up, talking recent things group hospitals think. study show damage (milder) asymptomatic people. Oh mean like Secretary Education, Betsy DeVos? Wow legit COVID. wonder orders given... That's logic Orwell would proud of. Whatever, long gets Benidorm's bars open time guess brit too, please note entire continent laughing lot.

Lovely. Though given continentals' penchant mass death left unsupervised, guess I'm surprised fun anyone (not person whose comment I'm replying to, apologies hijacking it)on anti-mask advocating businesses schools open soon possible: fuck you.

I fall category would like double ""fuck you"" wish hearty fuck people. even exceeds New York's daily cases peak April.

And quite worrisome see [those videos admittedly sick streamers Disney showing long lines social distancing.

Seriously, people. political party They‚Äôll volunteers different countries, probably Thailand. It‚Äôs almost like lack nationwide stay-at-home order mandatory mask-wearing order president caused huge lack cohesion resulted countless lives lost unnecessarily.  two words mean thing. Anyone medical field tells otherwise come review immediately. 

They knowingly passing false information. Failure extend unemployment benefits eviction protection that... That's still reason spread false information asymptomatic transmission. reason widespread proactive testing either type case found time. Quite lucky. shared space wanted us come back. suddenly space me. choice tho. Basically either go start lookin elsewhere. ""I slash wrist open bleed out, Covid they'll count Covid death.""

No won't.

Here comes conspiracy nonsense.

Record Covid deaths, hospitalizations, cases...Maybe soon, able see reality. poke holes paper bag. That‚Äôs AMC going bankrupt right? don‚Äôt think understand buisness work. Even making movies movie theatre would still open. still pay rent fire employees. Even movie industry never same. Shutting things doesn‚Äôt mean everyone stops paying anything bills go away. Gotta open schools though, go Walmart thirty minutes, kids safe school. /s feel inevitable NY sees another surge. Mar style something nonetheless. many stupid state people come ruin read something nose wires masks 5G antennas mind control. So, apparently limit craziness. sorry millions paid billions hard earned $$$ corrupt, broken system could care less whether received treatment not. sorry ill &amp; left screwed w bills made lose homes. sorry millions families affected decades people couldn‚Äôt afford cost mental healthcare. sorry people w chronic conditions refused insurance it‚Äôs ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù people. sorry making much profit company...

Rethink allegiance big companies, kind. Vote people want change testing drastically slow weekends? Gonna fucked next week Florida like ( probably next 2-3 weeks since want reopen schools). feel like video something supposed load black box... (on mobile).  Couldn‚Äôt agree more.

And dan Patrick news saying he‚Äôs done listening medical pros keep wrong. means, let know dan Patrick radio host thinks this. initial comment took issue conclusion nobody develops immunity based 1 case. conclusion pointed exist.

Edit: also pointed based 1 case. key difference coronavirus actually TON asymptomatic spreaders. idea spreading germs. exactly everyone needs wear mask.

New evidence shows wearing mask also protects person wearing extent. 

If drinking driving necessarily mean hurt someone either. wearing seatbelt mean something bad necessarily happen. Smoking inside restaurant necessarily immediately harm everyone inside. public health measures preventative. 

You absolutely spreading coronavirus know (which accounts actually large percentage spread). one way deal make every single person wear mask. Given also slightly protects person wearing it, optimal way stop spread disease. 

And, look countries successful squashing virus....everyone wore mask. either re-open economy...OR could always shut everything relax restrictions wearing masks (which started). can't ways. delusional, especially science prove it. Yeah. None true. ‚Äúfour legs good, two legs bad...‚Äù

Reading comment taking sip water probably wasn‚Äôt best idea ü§£ I‚Äôm sure made laugh hard Thank you! Ive played safe despite work never chancing policies. Last week fox news blaming Democrats politicizing mask. trump wearing one. Republicans changing political strategy. next two weeks interesting made up. proof contracting virus. conjecture. Show data regarding infection rates among women men middle east. assume every household unmasked men spreading virus around. Back claim least one shred data. ""President wears mask hospital pandemic."" news, yet, lmao people already capitalized this. he‚Äôs going get treated wearing mask distraction perfect cover story. True. Happy cake day though. wore visit hospital, that's all. There's always going rebound vaccine appears pull Tom Parker.

Sell MAGA masks sell Trump's moron masks. Lmao. Check shadows. tell picture taken roughly 2-3pm. Second, check line right side picture. Anyone common sense tell 6 feet all.   anyone still trusts Fauci weren‚Äôt paying attention till late March. Good ol louis Yep would definitely class wacko conspiracy theory. wide-walk edit when? good know, pathetic point history even news-worthy. wearing months ago. Fricken tool. northeast basically everyone hospital gets tested regardless. wonder visiting hospital, wore context. Yay..sounds great.. go America... stop testing simply surrender! espouse kind crap need removed position authority. simply mindset can‚Äôt defeat virus might well bury heads sand go life normal!

None spineless individuals fit serve leadership capacity crisis. Frankly, feel providing ‚Äúaid enemy‚Äù war...and imprisoned treason!

I know radically extreme position, going casualties these,people continue spouting ideas this. get serious start putting ‚Äúteeth‚Äù behind advisories recommendations, going continue struggling virus.

I don‚Äôt support Chinese record human rights means, seems evident extremely tight quarantines enforced military effective relatively short term. 

Two three months lockdown pain ass people, rid enemy part. U.S., six weeks mostly ‚Äúhonor system‚Äù lockdown (which many completely disregarded) reopening damn near everything! Bars? Movie theaters? Indoor dining? hell think going happen?

That comment made laugh outloud. Psychiatrist here. isn‚Äôt quite accurate. profession something called ‚ÄúGoldwater Rule‚Äù says cannot ethically diagnose people personally examined patients (such celebrities). psychology colleagues ethical rule, believe principle still applies diagnosis made without actual examination held true proper. 

Specifically Trump though, there‚Äôs something extremely interesting (to me, least.) don‚Äôt think ANYONE (even Trump himself) would argue displays many narcissistic ‚Äútraits.‚Äù guy writes name giant gold letters chance gets haha. actual diagnosis personality disorder (and mental health disorders) requires checking list symptoms. 

Diagnosis requires symptoms result distress impairment key areas life. example, I‚Äôve seen narcissistic patients get fired work divorced ostracized friends family difficult.

First importantly, capable getting elected highest office land, held position almost full term now, despite strong attempts opposing party remove power. seem like impairment me. held ~95%+ approval rate among members party (i haven‚Äôt looked lately, still high?). Partisanship aside, people share political beliefs seem think bang job. get divorced once, current marriage lasted quite time, part family, especially immediate family seem love him. Many former associates people who‚Äôve met reported positive experiences. Even Hillary Clinton, asked name something admired opponent debate, named children credit name, again, really scream ‚Äúimpairment‚Äù usual clinical sense. 

Now, maybe course exam would learn something wild as: Melania blackmailed stay way marriage actually shambles, kids hate it‚Äôs show cameras, etc. *comfirmable* public evidence I‚Äôve never seen enough evidence makes think Trump would meet criteria impairment. super interesting he‚Äôs got HUGE narcissistic **traits**. 

But aside, ONE diagnose Trump accurately without clinical exam. Anyone telling otherwise, acting a) unethically IMO, b) political manner, clinical manner. Victoria's moved!

Oh justify europe already full lockdown mode US still didnt budge(italy ""shockingly"" approaching 10k cases day, something multiple states hitting now) reality trying lie everyone here, manipulating data show opposite truth.

But yes vast amount cases caught testing either due mild symptoms lack available tests. Even rate infection 10x higher catching would mean 10% US infected. rate going wont br long 90% infected. think happen people show hospital once? really is. keep moving goal post there‚Äôs enough evidence already

So 1% = currently infected 3,258,400 individuals....hmmm, let‚Äôs simple multiplication. apologize ahead time find advanced arithmetic confusing! Don‚Äôt hate ‚Äòword problems‚Äô?

We ‚Äúonly‚Äù need another 69% - 69 x 3,258,400 = 224,829,600 cases!

Look Daily Deaths graph there. uptick started week ago bet continue rise. Still first wave Nope majority college students NY opposing this. clearly tell huge spike would begin happens. Mask alone would protect you. Social distancing would next impossible. Specially class changes.

The people want schools reopen parents young children. Maybe haven‚Äôt seen evidence yet. 

And common sense would say virus doesn‚Äôt replicate enough give fever symptoms, could long term damage time? Thin people die too.  agree with? tests person counted? they're positive keep testing case number go up? they're negative keep testing test positivity rate go down? sub EXTREMELY privileged.

""How else supposed know dangerous ones are?"" So, read still sounds like pneumonia deaths uncounted covid deaths, much reported.

If 1,762 covid deaths 5,185 pneumonia deaths, numbers mean 1762 pneumonia covid. number flu others remainder pneumonia only.

So that's 3423 deaths left (assuming 1 1 covid pneumonia reporting) , 900 need left 2523.

Would normally attribute 2523 pneumonia deaths yearly different diseases? number deduced looking non consolidated previous year data? 

And there's Dr Fauci saying numbers low either way reasons. Wonder much longer states (TX, CA, FL) pretend path exists end second months-long lockdown.

Dead people pay taxes fucked economies either way America, here's idea: STOP TRYING PUT TIMEFRAME IT! 1 week, 2 weeks, 14 days, 1 month, on. shut re-open numbers near eliminated. Stop leading people this. Yes, right-wing lose shit, time bullshit now. miserable existence please prove actually care health well people  Full lockdowns coming Florida?

Jeebus. don‚Äôt racist count based income call ""Trans Broken Arm Syndrome"", i.e. people blame every single one health problems HRT, including broken arm.

In case, irony anything, [the data point androgens (testosterone) possibly playing role exacerbating symptoms visiting everything lab? places like florida reporting deaths occured back may play Battleship Betsey's yachts. blown away firm letting travel air back clients... started allowing folks visit clients locally drive client, airline travel table firm-wide September earliest. live medium sized city Ontario. 2 hospitals here. made field hospital back March (could early April.

Seems big likely full scope buffoon Governments fail protect citizens shouldn‚Äòt get federal funds Oh boy better? ?????? even mean? supposed hibernate like summer? know people countries got spread control could things, right?

Jealousy good look, friend. I'm sorry countries figured manage COVID send kids back school Americans worry they're sending kids enclosed death traps, like due school shootings happen America. remember 11 years old bored. hahahah Bill raised us better this. quit wearing masks even state said to. even bought masks pocket offer, met rude remarks. stressed making money dipping savings soon. conflicted leaving hanging, care me. Also proud city state. vast majority still taking seriously - stores require masks, trust subways buses, we're living life caution (but returning kind normal). 7pm clap thing since end May. hope don‚Äôt get complacent.

Back entire world criticizing violating human rights, much. actually might true. texas school release survey 60% wanting return. school NY 90%. I've heard similar schools Tennessee well. teachers shouldnt making decision either scientists unless stats otherwise every release story I've seen made clear teachers want work home (because many teachers realize doesnt work all) can't ""profit"" - ""profit"" VA. That's mean shady, means there's money it. Scroll Daily New Cases graph click 7 day moving average button. see prior today number new cases day plateaued recent run up. way cases come waves likely related timing government reporting rather actual date sickness.  Yep super glad live here. It‚Äôs scary working healthcare pandemic, bad state control. one professor taking class wants us return. physical chemistry considered difficult class makes sense want person. However, excuse lives. People wondering stock still going cases increases like crazy. think Florida set good example reason. economy move forward confidently. Even COVID19 infect everyone, stop economy fear. Brave stupidity. never said keep colleges closed. meant better stay online clear. agree labs re-open need sterile environment. NY? Look CUNY page many people openly oppose person classes. Canadian here. amused all. Scared guys, honest. leadership US failed citizens. We're bombarded news agencies showing Americans downplaying seriousness virus making seem like right thinks hoax. 80%+ Canadians want open borders. Yep. one Trump sign see area suburban Boston totally vandalized. worries plus reports prolonged recovery times - can't imagine bad it'd immunity wears many made full recovery last round. agree too. people like said best way really shielding elderly vulnerable.

Most either nonsense (shutting schools) anything backfire (people WAYYYY much faith masks. giving people way much security.

""We've opened Disney yesterday, anti-mask movement thrives schools scheduled reopen soon, questions?""

""No questions easy, I'm tired winning"" like pregnant women get additional $500 children stimulus, took opening wallets GOP say unborn babies humans rights would granted such... fucking hypocrites. Prisontime plz

Anti mask people bioterrorists NY took measures lock down. Besides counties, FL doesn‚Äôt care. mandatory masks, curfew, lockdowns. go eat restaurant go theme park right wanted to, never saw level irresponsibility peak NY. anyone data exactly people get from? mean Disney opened 2 days ago. many people getting ""hair cuts""? testing? need details.

Testing would great also knew people distancing wearing masks. Let's get full picture, learn. Obvious troll obvious ""no subject could infected virus, dead. vaccine works"" completely true. example Finland tested feeling like dying, symptoms, told isolate home. actually good way it, much get diagnosis.  think disappointed invagination also. guys think we‚Äôll normal Christmas year? 
Today‚Äôs record completely shattered confidence. planning fly families really don‚Äôt know. US isn‚Äôt actively fighting war labeled us it‚Äôs people, new enemy fight. New York/New Jersey started months ago. seniors started dying nursing homes, wanted death certificate changed list state residence instead state nursing home in. one real tossup nursing home years die. new study showing thing already seen many times. Antibody levels drop time. again, article confuses immunity antibodies, mention many, many components immune system body use mount response.  reason eu low numbers basically stopped testing program appreciate kind words. 

I hope turns around, mental response anything getting high fucking pure anger (unless whining getting fuck).

I plan on, least, talking while. Sadly, first time him. don‚Äôt think rape encouraged economics compared slightest..... part? impressed affordable was. Munich somewhere close mountains safe. simple trip grocery store risky. ever. virus lurking around almost every corner. wish everyone would take seriously. 

I see outdoor restraunts jammed people, nobody wearing masks. outside mean risk goes zero. outside sitting hour surrounded bunch fucking assholes without masks, real surprise sooner later. see point putting two category number looks impressive, sorry. leader believes science. 

I still work get positive test. would get fired didn‚Äôt.

I feel bad contact tracer would handed case considering job sell beer 300 places week restaurants, liquor stores, bars grocery stores. stats accurate without consistent testing? increase testing, you‚Äôll increase number? What's point? Let put way... life I've ever seen black crows. leads conclusion crows black.

But bring crow white, change fact crows seen black... change conclusion *all* crows black.

A single data point overturn lifetime's worth observations alter conclusion. called ""falsification"".

What saying equivalent ""but crows seen black, therefore crows black single data point meaningless."" Contact tracer says ‚Äúfamilies [...] unable get food quarantine neither access delivery services nearby friends relatives shop them‚Äù. thought interesting. Glad see bigger areas complying. Small towns I‚Äôve surreal. friends started report businesses. couple stores sign saying staff medical issues prevent wearing masks. Japanese pay US base, Trump recently started asking 4x price.

I'm anxious second wave Pretty sure already covered ""protest"", I'm constitutional scholar.

Mitch's #1 priority scares me, hope allowed pass 5 year blanket immunity. passes lot extra people suffer die. cells suggest long term immunity antibodies lack grace candor asked educate others speaks playing logical fallacy bingo? 1) may want reconsider shitty question sounds talking someone living it. kill yourself?

2) surprised. there's one key human trait adaptability. tested teaches really value, hold onto even give lot. changes make keep highest priorities sight? mother got nursing training US Air-force. said Marines arrived anywhere, ‚Äúyou order extra rape kits.‚Äù Florida: want open schools florida! 

Florida, days later: 15000 cases today don‚Äôt unless absolutely necessary, it‚Äôs mask I‚Äôm out. majority shopping done curbside pickup. It‚Äôs crazy I‚Äôve Walmart mall year. sure that... 

As far understand, infectious period stops normally sick covid-19 patients virus fully goes away.

Lessening lethality carry risk people even less careful - ""know probably die it"" different approach virus easily also spread around. would like see poll shows majority college students want colleges stay closed. There‚Äôs proof opening colleges would cause huge surge, follow proper safety measures, masks. problem online classes many things can‚Äôt done online. would labs online? would research online? would support hybrid model college students return campus things done online done online things can‚Äôt aren‚Äôt. Pre-symptomatic people spread virus quite easily. never develop symptoms don't. aren‚Äôt two options... that‚Äôs framework assessing new drug therapies. adding strain states acting stupid. lot harder keep numbers low everywhere else one get confirmation infections know sacrifice full quarantine.

Thanks guys. Thanks whoole lot. Yup. saw people r/nyc ""arguing"" protests cause covid. they're also talking bbqs, people jogging, beach. hell one group outside different other? also got downvoted saying everyone mask. saw protest NYC. I'm making stuff up. sure mask all, end all, standing group couple hundred people.

I saw people saying ""there proof protests increase covid."" Sorry, 1) tracers allowed ask protest attendance 2) proof, think pro-protest media mayor would publicize it?! 

I mean, type people freaking someone ""exposed"" covid pool Ozarks - even mean got it. want talk hypothetical future cases, real cases. Wow, thanks that. aware time lag extreme. sounds, then, like could *two months* time unlucky person tests positive appears death statistics. Since elsewhere read critical patients often spending 3 4 weeks ICU.

Gosh, nightmare whole thing is. Hope people don‚Äôt bring them. Ireland doesn‚Äôt deserve Florida‚Äôs border closed like yesterday. Travel ban to/from state except essential goods. Come Arizona, attack freedumbs.  agree much that. don‚Äôt really understand deaths us take seriously are. uncle hospital ventilator don‚Äôt need die understand aren‚Äôt taking virus seriously enough. see 15k one day one state enough change going this. much old saying of: ""ask country you, instead ask country."" phrase coined party idiots currently reopening southern United States causing first outbreak outbreak ended yet.

I want schools reopen point. want able sit casual dinner family point.

It‚Äôs reminder aren‚Äôt yet.  stfu buy bill give needy rich, sick, ... link sent shows decline deaths last weeks. looking at? Bottom left graph shows flat deaths followed slight decline last weeks. 10,0000 lives seems high price politically correct imo. China screaming world virus dangerous. US chose listen, look us. look graphs, like worldometer, update graphs retroactively, test June get added today's count? think #'s, Florida might forced shut again.. holy shit commuted stone's sentence. mad due man convicted criminal. face corruption way expect Brazil, Turkey, Russia. US. it‚Äôs really weird. People getting it, hospitalized, getting better sent home testing negative. get symptoms test positive, get re-admitted hospital. Sometimes second time worse first them. could antibodies aren‚Äôt lasting, virus never went away somehow goes dormant. countries mentioned three EU. Japan schools shut time Sweden. countries seeing overall rise community spread, let's pretend sat asses nothing. Plus, mask usage normal Japan. known since march Except US 25% worldwide infections deaths instead less 2%. post makes sense whatsoever.   

So stop wearing masks practicing good hand hygiene, social distancing people need interact public, need childcare, need see doctor?   

If 100% mask wearing, good hand hygiene, social distancing we‚Äôll significantly lower infection rates making activity safer.  

Face it, we‚Äôll wearing masks 2022, 2023, takes 1 knucklehead something stupid poof we‚Äôre right back started. DeSantis needs go prison. wanted people least 6 ft away shit started. honestly gets worse. ALSO terrible hygiene regards showering.

I‚Äôm NY, flattened curve month two ago Bc LAW wear masks everywhere state. numbers low comparatively March April. friends visited North Carolina Florida said body adhering mask rules, social distancing. Iv never happier live state competent leadership. (Yes know probably get another spike, I‚Äôm grateful it‚Äôs handled way far) America number one! agree, I'm tired rhetoric we've used regarding 4 years now. I'm done bringing recognition anything greatest failure history country. Individual states putting proper measures absolute cluster fuck, leadership even prime concern. 

First foremost, citizens stop pedants wear masks, instead thinking right prior. wasn't, now. Anyone thinking mask freedom pandemic liability. killing old assholes!

Wait... peak deaths UK particularly higher worst hit Europe, death rates come much slowly many EU countries. due fact relaxations restrictions introduced based actual rates infection community, countries Europe relaxing restrictions (with much lower infection rates per capita) time want left behind, combined deliberately weak messaging government political gameplaying prioritise job one unelected advisor public health. lockdown much ease gradually crumble; significant plan, constant muddying messages much nobody really knows what's going on. government already started blaming deaths people following guidelines despite government responsible developing guidelines clarity, contradicted medical advice, vague unenforceable.

Our death rates present averaging barely entirety EU obviously vastly larger population, surprised EU goes us shortly overall EU response better implemented. We're massively risk country compared US South America right now, we're continuing lag behind Europe quality response despite resources much better. Lagging behind Europe forced listen Conservative politicians tell us 'world-beating' we're seems excellent preparation many years post-Brexit life going like. need keep canada's border closed long time. know come harsh unempathetic, sounds like father contracted virus due social distancing...

People end facing consequences individual actions regardless family blames. virus indifferent.

It's July, February. point people exercise personal responsiblity. look sort ""don't blame child sins father."" Walt dead gone legacy acknowledged, Disney today judged actions, founder. goes Fanta, Hugo Boss, etc. Aye that's looking for, thank you! it? really? like politicians heard wave thought themselves, ""that's nearly enough suffering."" blaming Mexico South... LOL. Tbh people attend things allowed take hospital beds. typo, apologies Congratulations, New York! glad hear this.... Deaths matter differentiating active cases vs antibodies present. think see deaths skyrocketing proportion cases? may misrepresentation, useful one. Yes, terms controlling spread every delay means many infected people know positive. 

So combine fact actual quarantine, understand way US testing may give numbers track spread, going stop spread virus. bullshit people die preexisting conditions get it, fucks tell us ""we going get anyway"" uh, no. plan people gunning us getting infected? Haha YES meta Would put amount energy downplaying condoms AIDS pandemic?

Yep. Hence, ‚Äúabstinence only‚Äù sex ed schools. Ok, explains stuff. wondering death curve seems erratric compared case curve. could tests ground now. bound spike number positives. testing, great testing, people saying seeing many positive tests testing BEST, mean could get lower results would mean would test less. Masks help, fake PLANDEMIC, like spraying water fake fire, need. back testing, job numbers? blacks , people tell sir good blacks, Kanye running you? Unfortunately, don‚Äôt get look countries models pick choose best parts countries system jam ours. virus laugh destroy us. 

We need testing tracing kids go back.

We need lower positivity rate. hear Arizona‚Äôs rate much entirety Europe? 

We need parents families complete idiots day-to-day, doesn‚Äôt seem possible. 

We need wait. Maybe sit hands months look resuming in-person schooling. could eliminate summer break next year get us back track. 

How many students adults allowed die failed school reopening? answer ZERO. Mandate masks, hand fines feed needy money. sounds like sweet career path, friend! MS broad degree went depth undergrad degree, option focus, focused human sexuality personality disorders; lots interesting overlap attachment styles, sexual practices, cluster B personality traits. greatly beneficial working inpatient population. 

I much experience working kids, I'll say this: Kids usually pretty alright. parents frustrating. Without masks, also identified security camera. Now, left make law allows found fined. less cases EU? I'm talking sheer numbers. politics, media, propaganda. numbers. think? More, less, exactly same? yeah, super great us part stay healthy safe feeling desperately caged shitty country can't get out. super rad. f*ck 'mericans, amirite? whole fsmily could die change literally said that, yes. Nobody blaming kids Unless they're Middle East.  health minister said country something? Silver lining less people pull lever Trump November. Wonder many 147 London Title click-bait. tested 3,000 people contact COVID try measure accuracy tracking tracing. Lowe number goal, incredible good new Korea. implies silent carriers slipping cracks. 

This nothing inability us develop antibodies virus, indication vaccine work. Read article. Yeah, everyone totally believes seeing anti-science nonsense above. Lmao. Yeah, stage got control rather letting spread. I've gone going work sometimes never. TX employer even telling us cases find anymore, rumor 5-6 department recent weeks. straight wanna go outside city.

And yeah returning summer...my guess 2021 rate. Problem may get sick infecting vulnerable people...  USA! USA! USA! Number #1!!! excuse make? explained where, people wore masks Paris. line space mountain! Hold tho.. I'm bit younger him, enough younger ever acceptable life, alright it. poor choice costume. (From American perspective.. maybe cool Canada 25 years ago) Cherry picking one two studies say death rate 0.02% (same, maybe less bad flu). Also, idea herd immunity occurs quickly magically. one's complicated, heck I'll fill in.

First, idea 20% need immunity herd immunity occur since mostly certain set highly socially mobile people mostly spread disease.

Second, stupid analysis correlates high deaths harsh lockdowns. Implying lockdowns matter maybe even caused deaths. poorly interpreted data used argue COVID thing irrespective policy lockdowns ""naturally tapers off"".

How? Maybe people infected think T-cell immunity? Maybe... well there's new excuse every week.

They expect virus peak maybe 5-20% population infected naturally decline, policies needed. 0.02% dead. best thing let run course, keep economy alive, pray one unlucky ones, protect elderly (all reason spread quickly), social distance little, mostly, live fear!! Hence masks unecessary, unhelpful fearful too.

And anyone says corona bad lying media jerk trying harm Trump.

....

Now, political attitudes attitudes media - admit - somewhat justified. even like Fauci protecting big bux pharma solutions admit lab accident angle.

But, overall narrative conservatives bought constructed array cherry picked facts fallacies. also convenient means confront normalcy bias. hold breath moment virus go away.

Any response willful harm, meant hurt economy Trump reason. Maybe Chinese scam. knows... Likely employment related Thank you, donald EU would still #1 UK brexit. reason triggers you. might lower cognitive ability. Another way look current case count U.S. officially reached 1% infection population. 69 times reach theoretical herd immunity. bad. end, right. Wow, Trump wear mask drink glass water one hand?!? ***finally*** see elected president.

/s

Side note, totally see forgetting he's wearing mask attempting drink water it. may able each, bet can't time! arrived Walter Reed read Riot Act

It's military hospital he's commander chief, wonder could even go. think combo #1 (Stone distraction) maybe finally realizes shit getting worse, worse gets worse looks reelection, seen mask actually help. realize ""leadership"" way worried money health even lives? can't believe people OK that. hear you. may lot Canadian culture critics operating American ""space"" today. months ago outbreak mostly around NYC, new infections happening across number cities multiple states. hospitals places like Texas Florida nowhere near busy ones New York where.

Yet Yes quite surprisingly aggressive! Well, don‚Äôt let get down. agree didnt make point clear, isnt thing constantly heard every expert gathering groups people leads infections? seems nearly everyone replied made assumption saying protests leading cause infections wanted say one factors contributing them. 

Quite honestly, thread getting exhausting me, last reply Brexit guess?  10 year old eats carrot first time. God remember lockdown first started wife talking we'll prob good summer. ignorant youth Stupidity become greatest weapon used Republican party.

Literally, get together say make constituency stupid, feel smart. Damn man. I‚Äôm Texas surprised. least Florida gods work make sure state handles worse. read r/trump subreddit ok cases Europe Europe population faaaar lower.

Hmmm, corrected now. I‚Äôve already seen one wild. They‚Äôre there.  RemindMe! 6 months already ran experiment shit last 2 months.... know feels; sometimes speaking worst thing one career. Kudos Dr. Fauci putting people first. Eh dangerous sentiment. kid reckless skate board? Sorry kid reckless, set leg. Like second pick choose reason gets health care dangerous things happen. probably hyperbolic (I hope) express dangerous sentiments without qualifying even little, cause ppl might agree, that's get bad policy like, ""if can't afford health care deserve it"" (the current Republican stance) testing 10x live CFS among ton things (Lupus, something gut trying get dx'd beyond blanket IBS, fibromyalgia, chronic migraines, narcolepsy, etc...)

You learn ""live"" entirely change life. run business instead regular job (engineering) least bring little money disability fucking hard get on, restrictive, gave years trying. days wake hours need something, especially since can't afford meds anymore, time get woken going.

Brain fog intense. Forgetting things time one depressing things cope with. feel like losing mind.

People rough wakeup, definitely happy that... hope maybe gets us ""disabled"" category least little respect, maybe leads work done better/more affordable healthcare. Thanks reply! There‚Äôs good answer question. Sometimes life every possibility sucks. Send kids back school, schools inevitably explode Covid, forced shut anyway month in. That‚Äôs going happen. might well prepare it.

The funny thing 100% correct. Kids need school, schools can‚Äôt stay shut forever, it‚Äôs hard working parents. Yes, right. However none matters. doesn‚Äôt matter logical argument right are. virus doesn‚Äôt give shit this. doesn‚Äôt give shit working parents. doesn‚Äôt give shit American politics. doesn‚Äôt give shit importance kids school. point human arguments useless virus simply doesn‚Äôt care.

The thing would helped would US would taken virus seriously decent leadership tackle head-on get control. However, missed opportunity spiraling control. no, don‚Äôt good answers good choices. screwed.  I'd like see big survey asking people whether job allows work home response data broken race/ethnicity &amp; household income Yeah, saw videos. saw drone footage.

Laughs Texan call C suggesting every suffering incompetence, poverty malice reported cases reported lower? Plus UK really reporting many new cases right? Deaths always lagging long tail.

Months ago told masks work know that's true. acted outdoors indoors rate spread know that's true. Yet people still want believe it; different believing masks work? based science denial, except one side coat falsehood veneer fake virtue. required lot people it! Except there's [growing antibodies virus last long, puts herd immunity table. 

You might immune months reinfected that. people sacrifice many lives admitting messed up. There, fixed you.

Throw away get new one business kick mesh masks it, right boot I'm blaming conspiracy theorist brother family  Jokes you. Facebook makes account ""Liberals say bad now""

Projecting, know that's **exactly** would do. campaign slogan 4 years ago...so obviously they've failed. idea they're still playing. People paid actual money see them? party wasn‚Äôt get coronavirus, idiots thought they‚Äôd fine get it. People shouldn‚Äôt celebrate deaths others stupid. Mike Tyson redeemed society‚Äôs eyes fucking rape, yet don‚Äôt think young dude wanting go party chance redemption? TIL San Diego republican... Yeah that's bad Friday Texas new death toll included woman died May   They‚Äôre also mass producing right we‚Äôll amount case turns real thing. Heaven forbid set good example Completely agree, like friends across pond, majority UK wear masks challenges rights freedom, that's here. It' said, us Brits culturally similar (if ask me). 

While stubborn people refuse wear masks group large quantities. **vast** majority blame go government uncertain nearly every Covid decision faced. recent **maybe** wearing masks shops, hilariously bad fact still letting flights without kind quarantine structure place solid 2-3 months lockdown.

Though woods means yet, curve flattened glimmer good news amongst this, lot us Britain, England particular, really questioning far along progress would acted faster decisive along way. British way thinking indecisive everything, Boris really needed balls stricter many things long ago. I'd rather keep Americans country least 2 years. wearing masks outside July Florida. I'm glad they're requiring masks, thanks. sounds miserable. good nothing family came Oregon Washington Arizona. Needless say, I'm thoroughly side family. 

Who knows many people narcissistic aunt infected. telework catches things like StarLink get developed might pipe dream long. dieeeeee mean, China faced shitton stuff like (SARS, H1N1, those), probably protocol installed ready moment's notice.

""Alright boys, eggheads lab confirmed got new pathogen running about. know drill; barb wire perimeter around listed district, man come in, man go out. move!""

In fact, East Asia prepared handle sort thing level, near it. Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, handled excellently (give take couple mishaps, locked quick). country Malaysia handled pretty poorly turnover gov't, replacement immediately put together bill complete national lockdown military deployed enforce it. we're cruising single digit case per day, estimating zero per day soon enough.

Until second wave, is. we're much prepared now. Fewer Cool. think videos disinfect mask, via steam microwave.

RZ badass masks, too: Deaths starting quickly rise weeks spike new cases hospitals affected areas getting overwhelmed. Given delay new case reported someone dying COVID-19, number daily deaths going rising rapidly next weeks staying high next month two.

That said, doubt Trump wearing mask public health reasons, least directly. Trump's numbers regards handling COVID-19 really plummeted past weeks that, accompanying rise cases (so reason people question handling), probably lead staff finally convincing wear mask public. 

It's totally absurd, absolutely praising him, start consistently wearing mask public, probably significant positive public health move made since start pandemic. would consider it‚Äôs much trouble need another hand washing. Good point. missed read it. 

I‚Äôve attached link triage think there's difference, though, thinking somebody hero sad death.

We can't ignore fact organized misinformation campaign around wearing masks. mad people fall it, point actively wish deaths. Isaac Asimov said: Anti-intellectualism¬†has constant thread winding way political cultural life, nurtured false notion democracy means 'my ignorance good knowledge. Duh get cases faster get herd immunity. get herd immunity people start dying nobody die.

Which 70,000 new cases day, 140K dead, running medical supplies across country, one area.  

Flu season starts 10 weeks, 10 weeks. COVID flu running together full tilt, real party, especially schools starting September, college students traveling across country return back college, problem. October we'll probably 100,000 120,000 new COVID cases day, flu season starts. 

Average flu cases per year 28.5 Million, per CDC, 446,000 hospitalizations 37,000 deaths. Imagine panic 10% country gets flu, think COVID overreact. 

I bet getting flu COVID time especially deadly. 

By time hit November, hospitals overrun, PPE's, limited medical supplies, death rate skyrocket.  Regardless bad gets country willing enter back shutdown again, we've picked course action we'll need see though. time next year, we'll probably 500,000 dead, lucky, we'll probably need endure additional 18 months. 

Oh wait, vaccine going save us? vaccine least 24 months. 

Trump right, eventually fade away, 2022, 2023 we'll 1-3 Million Americans dead.

Korea maybe, definitely Japan. wuhan,and fact days see foreigners street get nervous,many wear mask correctly. Life peaceful now. always flattening, even R0 bigger 1, run test capacity issues. That‚Äôs population already much increased risk mortality though. 3% pretty good, it‚Äôs significant. effective Florida report biggest number cases single day state Sunday less? it. problem negatively affects personally. Even then, lot find ways talk around it. Yup. trying back up, here. :) middle aged morons revolting against? goes heads decide hill literally want die on? really curious.

RemindMe! 16 days Oh, mistake. Boom European countries' borders closed (Sweden's still are), limiting peoples movement, vast majority Swedes practice social distancing despite government initially telling high importance, Swedes saw happening European countries followed behaviour.
Moreover, virus declined presence throughout Europe result many reasons US even initiated.

Why keep referring Sweden example? Letting virus thing US cause deaths many peoples braindead fucks who, day, think hoax keep travelling states.

Every single post referring Sweden downvoted. either dense beyond comprehension ignorant heck continue believe US follow Swedes government's initial response. know. See complete response: literally resigned industry continuously attacked exposed industry over, advocated ACA criticizing industry advocated Medicare All. U.S. can't even afford insulin need survive, give back?

Not say insurance companies flaws, insulin bigger problem pharmaceutical companies, Potter also pushed pointed Medicare along regulations control prices would prevent people defending him, what, exactly, lesson want rest us take away this? ""It's okay selfish jerk, long say sorry later!"" standards really sunk low?

Hang on, saying guy resigned continuously pushed industry witnessing impact otter employed Humana Kentucky moved Connecticut work CIGNA 1993. began journey towards resigning becoming consumer advocate July 2007 saw free clinic run Remote Area Medical rural saw appalled him. Hundreds desperate people, without medical insurance, descended clinic hills. People queued long lines basic medical procedures carried free charge. driven 200 miles Georgia. Many treated open air.

He literally resigned attacked industry over, pushing measures country.

Now, covid hotspot, seems batshit insane obvious US would getting highest number cases, reason provide.
Considering cases per 1 million, US surpassed much, much smaller countries.

Or Harambe wings depends arnt getting tested.

I feel someone showing symptoms, reason go would sick go. think lot people laying home dying COVID reported? feel like anyone else showing symptoms getting tested probably OK/manageable home. surprised many people would prefer recover personal home public hospital. vaccine may still possible. likely require booster shots possibility getting yearly even every 6 months that. That‚Äôs incorrect. Testing positive COVID 2 times necessarily mean infected 2 times, could mean immune system didn‚Äôt fully get rid first time. fact reinfection, that‚Äôs 1 possible explanation patient tested positive twice. Uh, T-cells one heavily researched components immune system. enormous component AIDS research went understanding function (and destruction via HIV). gave us orders magnitude new knowledge thanks decades research. specific reference new coronavirus, less well studied studies take time. even know French. He'd probably suggest people stop swallowing water way it'll keep count low. real nice number. Maybe take initiative GTFO. there's Congressional hearing matter, he'd earn forgiveness testified. Thank you! I‚Äôll read study shared time. Saved later :)

Thanks again! I‚Äôm always happy provide education need itüëç flying disease back states. federal government paid everyone stay home work 4-6 weeks, used time implement nationwide testing, tracing, isolation program (which would create lot jobs!), developed clear, consistent messaging importance wearing masks social distancing outdoors (instead saying covid nbd like Trump constantly does,) things would look different. Yes masks personal responsibility one major issues country use idea personal responsibility let government hook protecting ultra-rich leaving average person lurch. agree people don‚Äôt wear masks uninformed, selfish, both. doesn‚Äôt mean deserve die. federal government‚Äôs failure provide financial relief implement nationwide testing/tracing/isolation, combined propaganda encourages people disregard safety measures go life normal, what‚Äôs driving difference America rest world. government responding. low compared states?

Meaning, people surviving? numbers 15000 know about. Lots there. Sure, Jan. You‚Äôre definitely super important poker dude. Definitely. really showed ironclad logic. Estimates easy, real solid figures hard. say estimates reason. getting nervous 230 new cases 0.7% positive test rate Victoria (Australia). Coming gives much better sense security situation. probably varies greatly state. called back work (Texas) got results since two weeks since potentially exposed. employer treating virus like seasonal flu even though hospitals filling 30 miles away.

I‚Äôm impressed fit single set parameters, even though states differing policies affecting epidemiological parameters time. Given increases cases driving uniform set policies across states terms mask mandates potentially lockdowns, think model affected? US speed running heard immunity. think main park. believe outdoor animal park. Well saying seem odd. However, would talk care provider meantime treat covid19. hope find solution this! insanity. stayed home months could learn virus spreads help keep hospitals getting overrun. open soon numbers start going up.

Like yeah shit it‚Äôs supposed better last year‚Äôs well every iPhone ever made, including first one. It‚Äôs hard make best iPhone ever make one every fucking year. can't serious. There's least one big glaring difference. last weeks. No, going take researchers using cause mortality data estimate undercount. Cool story, explain tiny ass state like Arizona terrible rates coronavirus spread despite 1) tiny 2) rural hole. Okinawa would make money tourism us bases weren‚Äôt there. True. 

USA great standpoint researched. One major component T-cells, analogized ‚Äúcalling fire department,"" comparison antibodies (""using fire extinguisher‚Äù).  Yea gf said thing didn‚Äôt want say thing everyone else feel guys.. arizona checking in. Try stay safe there!  know, know, Sun worthless rag. seem [source since NY department health seems stopped posting data (if I'm wrong, please point posting it).

Basically, certain neighborhoods NYC almost certainly herd immunity, showing immunity. breaks way expect, poor neighborhoods show high rates, rich neighborhoods show low rates. 

Since rich afford maintain social distancing measures, poor already herd immunity, doubt NYC see another significant spike, even return school. Never attribute stupidity attribute malice. (My razor opposes Hanlon's stupid razor). downvote truthful statement? Let‚Äôs see shakes out, far better shape. horrible policies major states significantly contributed death rate (nursing home policy). New York nursing homes alone 40% deaths us, it‚Äôs changed may significant issues deaths. Ooh remember last time performed without following rules? would gain lying whistleblowing?

One could argue he's get attention, book deals, interviews, etc whistleblowing also puts giant target symbol you, ex-coworkers still industry also public screwed over. reason think sheer ignorance. Sorry hear buddy. y'all think got infected? Perfect time open Disneyland üëå Extremely unlikely. Trump would tried sell Louisiana back French. Exponential growth either beaten completely all. time loosen up, end right back were. Jesus fuck line keeps getting repeated don‚Äôt know coming from, Fox News? 

We don‚Äôt understand B cells cells well. don‚Äôt know quantify effect immunity. understand antibodies quantify effect. standard use measure immunity literally every disease. insane suddenly pretend aren‚Äôt important mysterious immune cells protect us place. It‚Äôs concept that‚Äôs extended well beyond ‚Äúoptimism‚Äù ignorance. understand people scared don‚Äôt want imagine isn‚Äôt something seasonal right REAL SCIENCE REAL SCIENTISTS understand likely conclusion. 

Optimism doesn‚Äôt change scientific method.  Nurses wuhan direct close contact coronavirus patients. There‚Äôs reason believe you‚Äôll direct close contact grocery store. Uv kills every living cells Katrina mishandled local authorities, federal response there. I'm sorry say partner can't bubble. I'm saying parents suck social distancing, hug see outside. really extreme person says can't see partner, popular opinion.  case fatality rate 

1500/85000 1.7%.


Nobody ever come close catching 100% cases means catching minority cases. much? know.

Wake Forest large antibody monitoring study. take number people seroconvert (ie many NEW people making detectable antibodies) use 2 week delay NC operating around 0.1% fatality probably don‚Äôt live hot spot then. AZ, ICUs full. That‚Äôs 80% capacity added March. even manifest new beds, can‚Äôt really conjure critical care staff. ICU nurses seeing 3 even 4 patients per shift, typically that‚Äôs 2:1 critical care. Even Med Surge 7-8 per shift 5. Hospitals begging travel staff come state like New York did, best luck.

Morgues almost capacity well, hospitals already inquired refrigerated trucks.

Many hospitals activated emergency overflow plans. children‚Äôs hospital COVID19 ward set adults.

If mean ‚Äúoverrun‚Äù like medical system completely breaks down? No. it‚Äôs gotten point need non COVID19 critical care, could get triaged.

Now imagine that, except didn‚Äôt economic shut let virus run wild? actual Americans. vote couple elections affect country whole. No, you‚Äôre absolutely right. industry decides reopen right certainly doesn‚Äôt care setting good example. Especially considering potential facilitate massive amount spread. It‚Äôs bummer. Yes, know know post merited sort response. Remind 6 weeks. wait open schools! worst part is, lot Canadians seem bought lies, too. people know still think Canadian doctors going US droves, last decade, actually way around. Texan, yes does. Smh might actually help author way confident conclusion relies 1 data point.""

Doesn't really make sense original context post. conclusion **based on** 1 reinfection, fact reinfection conclusion itself. deaths studies showing antibodies last months. really hope you‚Äôre right share optimism, I‚Äôm staying cautious Per capita still pretty tremendous! :-p  things equal, guaranteed healthcare decent social safety net lead better outcomes. people get tested virus, properly treated illness takes bad turn them, ability stay home required time manage virus without losing everything, lead better outcomes country things.

This, coupled poor management pandemic, U.S. already deaths per capita E.U. still trending upwards, much E.U. past worst (for now) appears plans place handle second wave.

Healthcare government funded, even single payer, deal pandemic, universal, effective coverage much is. make financial choice rather health choice, individual level, allow people make simpler decision reduce spread. Unfortunately, like show. need informed disinclined become informed many reasons. DO. mass murdering don‚Äôt even care. 
 
The blithering stupidity Americans full display world go history laughingstock this, rightly so.

I'm even gonna bother addressing ""like flu"" portion, spread throughout world, varying climates... connect dots? lmao Unfiltered water gives diarrhea totally understand need able see. methods people found prevent glasses fogging up. Probably best one I've come across using surgical tape along top mask create seal along top. key seems getting tight seal along top. anti-fogging solutions available say washing glasses soapy water helps, seem limited success. anti-fogging solutions appear junk others pretty legit. Remote school issues id rather see someone proactive find something works see school town reopen without masks, distancing, air circulation rooms cause one person gets it, everyone exposed

They least could cut non essential classes shorten day

For job drive school parking lot every day see 50 people leave weight room football practice distancing masks. reference, 50 people graduating per year average school. Even state locked town still went life usual weeks Couple false positive covid tests, may vaccine 2022 Also living Florida! (Southeastern) 

When go store bf, it‚Äôs like half people wear masks. scatter bugs either wearing mask incorrectly, all. look damn ‚Äòone-way‚Äô signs floors‚Äîhad instance Publix evening family four‚Äînon mask wearers‚Äî proceeded mosey aisle wrong direction. BF looked face coverings on, ignored us. 

There even ‚Äòtumbleweed masks‚Äô parking lot. mean don‚Äôt know people that. Progress days like nothing happening &amp; get heated politely tell 6feet wear damn mask. 

I hate governor, government, country! I‚Äôm scared, whole thing change outlook future indefinitely! us aren‚Äôt dumb state, bad news people always outplay good matter what.

edited: rephrasing We're already there. Last 3 days records. 119 deaths Thursday, 93 Friday, 95 Saturday. previous high 83 back April. Hey, like Puerto Rico full Americans!

\-Trump everyone ok losing home, able feed kids someone else's grandma.  Yeah that‚Äôs gonna suck, least it‚Äôll cold fuck won‚Äôt wanna leave house anyway honestly shocked seeing number people wearing masks could counted 1 2 hands got groceries earlier. 

This church let say that, least around here, type people refuse wear masks tend religious conservative groups sample size could shit, still, much better like. 

Walmart selling masks $1 door lot people wearing getting turned away. Hopefully kind attitude keeps up. feel u ;( High school. 20 students small room, 6+ hours day. Hormones.

I searched for...um...fun...whoa rabbit hole crazy... got really sick back february. Pretty sure wife brought school kid coughing lungs class. disinfected desk, I'm sure inhaled anyhow. 3 urgent care visits, pediatrician visit, one ambulance, helicopter ride bigger hospital son got proper care. Schools reopening whatsoever. Parents treat school daycare. know fact send kids sick school think get away it. shut Newsom? Well, assuming estimates accurate (which far foregone conclusion based method) notice lockdowns lifted Rt curve angled back June almost back 1.  minimum better nothing. pain feel foot like? I've spot feels like sunburn time touched 7 months now. doctor say much try diaper rash cream, help. Sure, can't use countries make point US...

It's obvious US would getting highest number cases deaths, given fact one populous countries world. populous is, longer it'll take control infection. Thisisfine.jpg always thought DeVos would impass get next election. Never she'd ruin US. legal kill fuckers self defense get close you. would hang assholes governor. Finally found good use death penalty. Depends Oxford's vaccine gets approved doses already made get distributed

Same Moderna mean, I'm pretty pumped cold house right now. 93 degrees outside. Lol.

Is HVAC rarity trailer park? parents taking ton precautions

If families taking precautions, think fine. I'm big advocate social/quarantine bubble idea. requires lot trust, great alternative people need align another household. mean, people like living separate partners, else supposed do? hang there‚Äôs hurricane nuking solve two problems. we're going mini shut downs every month next year?

*That's way less painful shutting completely months /s* they‚Äôre saving disney corona, duh! give federal funds paramilitary groups murder civilians brilliant scientist enough. effected public health leader needs apt playing politics well. Fauci standing President time, seek high profile going TV time, relationship President might better. 

Look big picture. impactful? Appearing stand Trump news? getting President act advice? sense, scarf lady, Birx, better job. least gets room impacting policy, rather Fauci talking outside. Dude, live here. NYC 8 million people. Situations like exceptions, norm. [I find input rather useful. go spread wisdom everyone come contact with. changed world. Pat dumb shit. believe this... multimillion dollar company that's losing money 9ff parks? Oh yeah totally gonna look health well-being others. protests please? Try stay topic know tough garbage narratives push focus. Enough people got infected already NJ distancing R0 well 1. thing NY.

The deaths per million states indicate huge number infections compared state US, even what‚Äôs happening Fl, Tx, Ca, Az, etc  One case never negative test positive tests doesn‚Äôt pick Vuitton straps? Things gotten worst. 

The last two test early May line testing site used. take 10 minutes. 

I rolled up. nose violated. way. we'll slaves succeed? hugged parents still see regularly. Outdoors. can't visit indoors thing. parents taking ton precautions, dad still goes grocery store every day reason, mom hugs grandkids, super careful. 

There always extreme people subs found that's majority. Depends area Rochester. I'd say half people see near home wear masks they're walking. work almost nobody wears mask except one area building absolutely required.

Inside stores I've seen almost 100% people masks I've also seen people pull talk. Nothing, general we‚Äôre well. cases went 3,000 day March less 200 amount testing. Right Arizona looking like us worst. Lots people dumb wearing masks seems like general people understand risk trying combat it. course people state welcome come, resident population seems handling pretty well along rest New England. Hard take '''scientist''' seriously believes gender spectrum. dad‚Äôs navy base told last night along base first confirmed cases. Marines stationed Okinawa going beach get togethers acting like it‚Äôs fucking Florida. goddamn 4th July party crying loud Keep mind like dozen testing sites they‚Äôre still slammed like this. bright side testing free still, lines tough. We‚Äôve converting parks, stadiums, convention centers testing sites it‚Äôs still tough I‚Äôm living Florida. Help me!!! seems excessive. cite source advice? Yeah Brixton. number people also pretty much 6 months ago Haha can't wait see numbers Disney reopening Winning biggly 

*coughs american* sure know read graph... 1952 cases, 22.3% positive, 10 deaths, 2 diagnoses Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Children Probably want make sure vaccine works safe humans pushing mass production. think agree Russia may exactly worry saying working vaccine. went multiple phases vaccine testing month? That's crack pipe dream. Oh poor family, heart hurts them... That‚Äôs unfortunate.. full lockdown 2 month, things likely normal. let herd immunity vaccines race top. Majority population underlying condition called obesity. CoVid may low cfr young people countries, likely country.

Sure young people irresponsible, kids, can't blame alone grown ass leaders criminally incompetent. seems yes. Good hear something positive midst happening south west convinced someone willing write number teacher/staff deaths ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù open economy.

Why acting like anything ordinary? 

Before go want stress think reopen schools.

We accept lives collateral damage sorts things, accept lives collateral damage able drive, accept lives collateral damage able consume alcohol, hell accept lives collateral damage (trying) keep government much access private lives.

If told 8 months ago ""coronavirus kill 5,000 Americans either shut country save 5,000 Americans let happen"" I'm willing bet vast majority people would said quick prayer one 5k wasnt friend loved one said let happen. 

We constantly trade lives freedom every day new thing. reasonable people realized numbers big time. course, arithmatic, resources - course, claim case numbers high testing more, also argue death numbers low suppressing reporting plainly lying, give sources corroborate stand. work numbers have. - 

Total cases = 3,387,470
Recovered = 1,505,671 (92%)
Deaths = 137,631 (8%)

Simply put, finally person declared done COVID, one dozen go home, 6 ft under. 

More data - Lol People going live lives, choose partake. expect people lose years youth this, odds spreading outdoor setting extremely minimal. Katrina affected mainly African-American communities, partly explains Bush administration paying much attention time. Covid hand, affecting *all* communities, include White-Americans. Bush administration would ball. cant get virus already *\*taps forehead\** I‚Äôm sure, could probably call hospital see set up, call pizza place delivers area. testify healthcare workers love eat! would appreciated. I‚Äôm Tucson, order food quite bit. Getting time eat another story! Gotcha. compare three case studies virus primarily airborne, instead primarily droplets, people side room infected. existing pattern compatible call center employees spreading chain via speech droplets. Note saw little spread floors (0.3% swabbed). know HVAC systems work Korea, air conditioning easily spread rooms seen examples infections rooms next super spreader events now.

If look Chinese restaurant tour bus study, looks like airborne spread happens artificial air currents continuous blowing infectious particles human source room you, extended period time. ran HVAC different room, would likely diluted cause infection. Imagine dude constantly peeing. stuck hot tub, bad, upstream big river, bad. HVAC pretty wide river, scientists think need acquire hundreds viral particles risk infection become significant. Unless infectious person devote entire night coughing air intake (usually roof) would think risks low. always issue told do. dont like that. lat line that, dont that, allowed this, forbidden that&lt;. 


But european, maybe americans take different way. Wow! school opening lawsuit that.

How long school? School districts really showing true character even ones call ""school families"". build wall make florida pay it? would get hotel? Wasn‚Äôt study showed recovered people, often ones severe illness, get spikes reinfection quite time? It‚Äôs diminishing graph smaller smaller spikes. people don‚Äôt get sick again, end testing positive.  even needs said really painful think about. can't even fix that, countries want us visit now. really horrible sinking feeling this. think teachers students fall covid-19 someone sees sense- government, obviously Agreed. I‚Äôm providing context Hong Kong might worried.

The US never/will never able implement contact tracing scheme like HK can‚Äôt use cellphone data. 

If look Hong Kong‚Äôs reported cases, tell building case whether are/were hospitalized. US also can‚Äôt HIPAA privacy rule. No, that's wide mark. fact, false. EU testing one either.

I'm really loving online classes right now. Much freedom go pace, lectures pre-recorded, profs respond emails quickly, waste time gas sit uncomfortably mask listening muffled lecture.

Especially happen. 15,000.....nope, high enough masks...Christ. None even close moving forward.

Pfizer Moderna ones even prepared Phase 3. None started. would take least 1-2 months show efficacy Phase 3 start.

Both Pfizer Moderna mRNA vaccines new technology never proven work let alone gotten approval.

Pfizer ability produce Moderna simply even close.


So Oxford fails odds vaccine year fall maybe 1% would late year best.


Nobody else even 6 months away showing efficacy. 


Oxford fails US reaching herd immunity vaccine comes.

Yeah, nice easy protect distant borders also pretty easy protect \*against\*. Isolationism works ways. Remember people shocked numbers images Italy beginning pandemic? happening much worse us (USA Brazil) people seem care much anymore. shock totally gone. frustrating thing people need wear masks stay couple metres apart month yet....no, that's much. many die well time many, many suffer permanent damage reduce life expectancy. case wear mask forever, necessary untill rate infection brought control. kinda hope opposite. wanna see deep rabbit hole Arizona Florida Texas go. place earth it, shithole counties? mean partly geography (are towns nearest neighbors 1,000 yards away spiking like nyc?), actually much basic reality happens here: everything *is* close together; people roommates lot time live close quarters; sheer amount people travel NJ/NY; sheer amount people live first place.

It's like Cuomo, etc., simply worst response. Obviously flawed, absolutely extenuating circumstances. confirm rise selfishness last decade largely behind successive conservative governments UK, nationalist Brexit movement. real. essentially endless amount shit ways stay touch people. Plus, still hang outdoors people. one denying (at least left criticize Russia narrative) foreign countries may egged pre-existing tensions something material gain US going shitter it‚Äôs putting outrage foreign entity distracts fact vulnerable kind thing doing.

We could get mad foreign entity stirring shit, could look country realize fire growing since long russia added sparks extreme amount anger effort placed foreign interference ignores many pre-existing issues allowed effect. yOuRe hOpInG wOrSt Deaths reported occur. get death certificates say covid know political gets. see daily death counts, also reported deaths potentially weeks ago. lag also getting worse. read Arizona doctor says death certificates signed 2 weeks ago, still reported counts mention countries stopped testing virus long time ago - Coinciding ""drop reported cases"" - 

There's vast number places either recording trying pretend corona deaths falling. France, instance fewest tests per capita *any* major western country, factor two (sort tests German, confirm.

DOCTOR, I'd watching levels consideration whether go hospital. body still getting enough oxygen, feel shitty, ""okay"".... again, understanding. wish health!! dirty test tubes good place virus mutate, least something. 

I still understand come virus RNA remnants remains around surfaces something like 14 days 77f / 25c remain recovered patients months 97.7f / 36.5c remnant broken longer recombine. is...all alittle sickening think about. Honesty virus COVID-19 Endemic species means like common cold, HIV, HPV, tuberculosis malaria diseases entire world face. 

COVID-19 permanent fixture lives Globally available vaccine made, humanity need make sure COVID-19 goes way Polio smallpox, took ~~decades~~ centuries get smallpox eradicated. smallpox vaccine, introduced Edward Jenner 1796 last known natural case Somalia 1977. 

That took stop smallpox polio still around 2018, 33 cases wild polio 104 cases vaccine-derived polio.This 350,000 wild cases 1988.  


   http://polioeradication.org/ based data it‚Äôs highly unlikely. mean 5 top ten infected states northeast. Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York city (which counted separately State New York). US number one! Look much efficient are! school reopens: ‚ÄúSome may die, sacrifice willing make.‚Äù americans complaining numbers cannot compared now? can't compare actions new zealand uruguay countries better they're We're horrible arizona.. well,.... see... scares death toll probably severely underestimated. There's big disparity countries count Corona deaths. count deaths confirmed cases hospitals. lot people dying outside hospitals nursing homes home counted statistics. 

The US currently pretty good mortality rates compared European countries. disparity explained better inclusive abed high quality health care US? statistics? Arizona produce anything besides golf courses retirement homes? basically talking ass.  think true rate infection US much much higher 7x. However hard judge without randomized testing. ontario seeing 0.5% positive rate testing, NY 1% Florida 20% issues confirmed numbers accurate go make best estimate. can't make numbers willy nilly. Pretty sure cases per million hard concept anti-vaxxers anti-mask wearers understand Obviously EU hides hundreds thousands cases, like China /s literally need create bunch Facebook groups promote ideas sow division hatred among American citizens *watch* themselves.

Have ever seen Inception? literally concept talk movie. enter someone's dream implant idea head manifest real world, make *believe* idea. per day

Cases per person per day

Ftfy It‚Äôs won‚Äôt allow spike happen, people going come tourism eventually, governor said 12k people hot spot states coming airports day. think comes proper tracking recording, plus improved treatments. also think ever consistent way determine coronavirus deaths accurate lot testing still is. LOL bachelor's science engineering make scientist anymore taking high school courses field does.

Source: BSc, bunch university friends recently graduated/are going graduate either soon BScs. You‚Äôre complete moron. honestly think happened spiking right started testing? testing 10x less time, running unchecked months. estimated 20% state population (6 million) already covid. governor slaughtered thousands nursing homes making mandatory readmit covid positive patients. Lee pretending Ny good job, though

The curve flattened follows parabolic pattern New York, states, european countries, regardless lockdown measures. looser restrictions follow curve, Europe. research see yourself, choose uneducated, don‚Äôt give shit either way. 

You compare curves previous pandemics history well, you‚Äôd like reference. go brainwashed news, call.

Typical ignorant college-aged braindead fuck spamming bullshit reddit. older ~~'muricans~~ **people** believe weed bad, gateway drug, blah blah

My parents also brainwashed even America (but they, like naturalized 'muricans), parents Indian. sad treachery villainry Nixon administration gotten well (as world blindly followed US declaring war drugs).

What saddens India literally origin cannabis indica. people using herbal medicine centuries term ""Aryuvedic medicine"".""

All takes someone power sociopathy gaslight world thinking smoking weed makes heroin addict. Great- think dosent spread don‚Äôt test? look number imported cases South Korea origin, paints clear picture

China: 19

Europe: 503

America: 636

Despite China people either Europe America, account tiny fraction imported cases. clear indication number actual cases China much smaller Europe/America he's right. suvivors event 40's, funny part pearl harbor plenty nazis active u.s. quite frowned upon u.s. learned atrocities. gaining herd immunity, also works.

To get herd immunity need 85-95% population immunity. gain naturally, even 1% mortality rate would mean *millions* dead. 

Not viable without vaccine. One percent 3.29 million still 32,000 people num nuts. article good summary COVID19 likely man-made likely evolved SARS super frustrating me. go meetings public space around 20 people... we're ""distanced"" extent we're somewhat rural area - actually ask us take masks everyone heard. though wear walk room meet in, we're sitting without masks 90 minutes couple times month. feels completely pointless wear mask one else is, since (from understanding) much protect wearer, instead contains virus point origin. Good. get faster everyone get back living normal life. live fear home next 5 years hoping vaccine. think safe say majority americans give fuck Arizcorona anymore. Sad, too. liked place!

Thats way country gotta persuasive swaying masses.

Many already partisan dont believe local federal governments now, generally ignorant first point. /thread 139K dead climbing   Putin laughing sleep every night last three half years. got hair cut stylist first time since February. wore mask course, she. telling unreasonable customers dealing with.

Britain, USA Brasil common? talking USA general Herd Immunity.

From nation funded BBC.

UK's chief scientific advisor suggests acquiring herd immunity definite way combat Covid19. Many us raised believe trust government.

This states require entering college students taken specific courses attending. Critical Thinking / PHIL101 typically one people need learn evaluate truth value information receive. ""information age"" particularly imperative people learn.

Should taught high school tbh. compassion man who's willful ignorance got killed likely got others sick.

What pity. bet large misinformation lost. Lost big time, likely around him. compassion reserve suffer fault own, suffering completely fault. know parents ones wearing masks kids carriers.

I said comment I‚Äôm emotionally unstable. laid lockdowns, able cope situation stable. It‚Äôs simply possible cope everything total shitshow. people think die second get thing? I'm starting think that's people believe....

We 11-12 week decline cases started spike early June. *Of course we'll also 11-12 week decline deaths well!* seeing death impact June‚Äôs initial spike cases.

Last week's spike deaths result last week's spike cases. result early June's initial spike cases long decline.

Most people denying thing downplaying understand simple math. die immediately. Deaths lag behind cases. Last week first indicator deaths going follow ever-growing spike cases started early June. exactly seen growing cases decreasing deaths past month. Watch flip average finger subs modding Covid stupidity something common. can't cure them.  ‚ÄúLess deadly‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean come good condition though.

People make statements like that, sadly, mean it. look up:  /s = sarcasm. Glad read post. take weeks months someone COVID-19 die. may take time process count death. people also die homes counted later. NY NJ still seeing decent number deaths within past couple weeks even low case count. Deaths slow. 

The death lag slower even tests take process.  Genuinely wild said response perfect think I'm conceding argument. main point, anyway, complete denial distinction cities impact dumb. sports leagues came plans workable. think accounted government population would take ""Fuck it"" attitude towards reducing numbers. real issue forged ahead also took ""we come far fuck it"" attitude well. mean hospitalizations deaths scarier metric imo hospitals capacity shit really hit fan... worst disaster since Spanish flu least history USA ain't longshot.

A 100% failure lead federal government many state governments well. Left us defenseless twisting wind deadly virus assaults, kills mains people life.  Dude I‚Äôm also Texas got crazy mystery virus end August 2019. Doctors didn‚Äôt know was, eventually got better two weeks. 

I felt really really bad. I‚Äôve flu before, way worse. remember sweating couch unable anything. 

Luckily, don‚Äôt think long term complications, weeks sucked. I‚Äôm sorry hear lingering effects. Fully agree here.

Hilarious people shit Disney Disney. Meanwhile Universal open month already lol. mean yea though. US tests per capita country world. thing exponential derivative exponential. far lower mortality rate, important number cases. leaders feel shame. past 4 years show this. Maybe November, holding breath. stunning number dumbasses combined election tampering outright fraud surprised decade two regime go (perhaps Trump helm, problem he). Nothing all. protesters wear masks, mostly prevent identification, masks also saved thier lives. Duh.

Unlike fucking drunken partying asshats think BBQ beer thier frats bros immunise them. feel ya loving heat (although 122 - 140 degrees F convert might get bit much unless dry heat, lol!!). 

Where it‚Äôs pretty much 60-70 year long...except ‚Äúsummer‚Äù weather, happens OCTOBER. Bay Area weird. Lol Peak dystopian Hey future. still twat. I‚Äôm asking see us idol, I‚Äôm definitely making excuses ‚Äúpatriot‚Äù crowd also can‚Äôt stand them.

Yeah, we're really bad UK. Like really, really bad.

But US much worse. climbing. yearly protest there. Okinawa Japanese would go want experience rape violent crimes. millions people need work still pay bills 

What exactly think Europe like? know people still work right? Yet somehow got testing many times every country EU.

Well that's true lmfao wrote comment last time article posted explained asymptomatic transmission rare, whereas pre-symptomatic transmission not. Sign up!

Go scan Wikipedia Foundations Geopolitics come back Fucking Christ literal toddlers smarter parents. cannot figure whether person presymptomatic asymptomatic he/she tested positive shows symptoms. don‚Äôt die right away covid? 13 days disease and/or weeks related complications Death reporting lag. deaths causing rate creep occurred 2 weeks ago. Look articles individual states.

New Jersey particular: article says stress it‚Äôs deaths confirmed aren‚Äôt happened last 24 hours. read another article can‚Äôt find right Florida take 2 weeks death report show statistics. 

The rise deaths expected, weren‚Äôt quite aware collectively actual numbers wouldn‚Äôt reflect reality long supposed million deaths.

*If absolutely nothing done.* forgot second part. Oh, worry, we're working it! read article areas surrounding NYC. home prices risen ~30% last couple months. People want work city feel need to. We're speedrunning shit boi Yeah, people elect stupid people run things. die. Ohio, USA. 

I've recently reconnected ex friends constantly saying she'd rather die wear mask public. fashion, fuck look like. voted Trump tells anything. 

 Ohio counties already make mandatory wear mask public. plans moving Tennessee soon, like going different. really understand Republican mindset says masks freedoms. Keep mind virus floats air like 30 minutes class room dangerous bunch people wearing mask just...crazy. Crazy. picture failure. Man, sobering thought though.

Because even live countries handled things properly. specter stretched risk American-borne second wave honestly rather terrifying. sure economy would survive another shut-down, lower-class near breaking point is. cases tied deaths....hello? Doesn‚Äôt take much. Remember 100% agree sentiment. wear mask, virus transmittable without symptoms, strong possibility transmitted others.  Yes bad. people move things, moved Spanish Flu, moved multiple world wars, they‚Äôll move Coronavirus. US worse UK, they‚Äôll also fine year. doesn‚Äôt mean deaths aren‚Äôt tragic, also doesn‚Äôt mean either country going collapse whatever mess think (or possibly want to). don‚Äôt mindlessly praise government, don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going usher apocalypse either. UK carry much before, it‚Äôs one largest economies world, that‚Äôs going change foreseeable future. fucking cult disgusting. also shut develop rigorous testing tracing control outbreaks. can't that. know cases coming from, large community spread, therefore cannot controlled. now. UK 1/5 population US 45,000 deaths compared US‚Äô 135,000; difference U.K. almost recovered started gradually remove restrictions *because it‚Äôs safe so* whereas US‚Äô infection rate growing vastly daily; whilst U.K. deal pandemic poorly first, would shocked US didn‚Äôt much much higher proportional total 4 weeks now. Trash source dawg really need stop using conventional wisdom thought true back March.

the virus spreads via water droplets virus expelled person person B's respiratory tract.

is risk fomites? really worried what's going happen flu cold season come back full force fall winter thing die then

I've pored articles various news sources seem quote WSJ article referred to. almost cases, headlines actually misleading (wrongly claiming Trump said that). possible thats remember literally said people choose wear masks like him

Maybe 5-10% population naturally immune lucky, since exposure doesn‚Äôt seem create immunity, stop? Well, repeated infections never stomping completely, eventually majority population could end dead. mention, it‚Äôs virus, single strand DNA, replicating trillion billion times throughout process, it‚Äôs going errors replication, mutations, knows virus grows original 5-10% immune mutated strains ... yea. Well since going going online masters program happy agree this.

there people throwing corona parties since day one.

one funny anecdote, girlfriends moms sister husband strickt anti vaxxers wanted leave state Bavaria, since strictest measure begin with. anyway Berlin looking apartments, cleverly took masks public transport, got asked to. put back since law, got waved sarcastically driver.

and linked irrelevant video.

Is title?? Literally article:

"" US - country hardest hit coronavirus - Saturday posted 66,000 new cases, daily record ""

We hit 70k+ Friday. 66k ""Saturday Record"" state don‚Äôt mind asking fuckin bring please? 2nd wave start?  3 year old fell broke arm last month climbing stuff basement. ER, children‚Äôs hospital required wear masks. several selfies 2 us, wearing masks. fucking 3 year old wear mask 2 hours time, getting X-rays, examined, cast applied, everyone else too. lifelong shit-health smoker mom COPD pacemaker wears one she‚Äôs too. barely talk without coughing, wears mask too.  fucking excuses. People really think every time person tests positive it‚Äôs added total. Even it‚Äôs second third test. However not. numbers reflect individual cases. positive tests. Substantial excess mortality seems start [during week (starting March 23), seem odd looking [confirmed Around 250 people die per day Sweden normal circumstances, covid deaths likely missed.

If look hard enough, always gonna able find something looks ""odd"" though. Applying Occam's razor remembering we've strategy that's stood enough world press write months, seems highly unlikely got [this (and [this month later) pure chance though, zooming bit.

Johan Carlson vested interest coming excuses too, earlier tried dump blame onto elderly care.

I really get people's enthusiasm defending Tegnell pals, given track record far endless series mispredictions. Feels like building altar least competent coworker...

Maybe philosophy thing people. Even Tegnell said [would've added got though. think point, Americans do? mean vaccine within 5 years fantasy need actual plan stop people dying interim. stroke healthy

Dying stupidity either poor sucker got Faux News'd right grave like yesterday. 


Edit: Kinda want one T-Shirt now. I'm professional data scientist master's degree Math William Mary. Please come educate statistics. pissing wind dude. okay. trust suck take deep breath new cases turn excess deaths over. History written winners. Okay due people able recognize sarcasm:

This virus likes Republicans Republicans hate science LOVE making everything political, even masks, personally can't see anything shocking that. solution burn propaganda machinery ground Covid parties describe though. Read article, people think hoax, actually Covid spread whatever insane thought pattern invalidity Covid.

These uneducated, stupid, willfully ignorant people, acting recklessly. people trying get catch it, like described pox party. I'm completely anti-these anti-science fucks. Fuck fuck wearing one public.

Anyway, understand chance become deadly less chance become less deadly. least quick reading thoughtful posts reddit came conclusion.

Regardless, put fucking mask fucking idiots. Liberal snowflake!!! Afraid kung-flu virus!!! LOL. Hoax President.  [A ship Jewish immigrants rejected actually shocked Americans see numbers, go shouting streets we're number one. problem testing later ramp up, actually need ramp faster faster, vicious cycle. outrun early epidemic, physically scale capacity enormous numbers compared running behind. Many countries lower per capita testing numbers US still ok.

Now US herculean task scaling outrun epidemic late stage.

Oh EU woods yet....not long shot. EU still registering 5k new positives daily basis worrying thing:

The Balkan region starting get hit. Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, North Macedonia...all rising trend curves wobbly health care infrastructure feeding land under? someone explain record cases, deaths **way** compared couple months ago?

I know there's lot reporting done now. still, make complete sense me. (I'm doubting virus thinking liberal hoax, bit confused) getting 8% mortality rate? like 1% confirmed cases, would put 0.2% 1 5 confirmed. believe every single case identified lol oh lord Im worried short term ramifications: case numbers, deaths, economy. I'm *terrified* longterm ramifications. We're going look back period see greatest public health failing therefore national security failing lives.

We see 9/11 first responders dying 20 years later due cancers carcinogens breathed dust particles. limited certain number victims/people certain place certain time disaster. 

This going 1000x worse. across country/globe. contagious. long timespan. Congratulations! COVID didnt kill 2020! Let's see next decades hold health.

 population going suffer terribly long time this. economy national security permanently handicapped. Florida 30k cases incoming  sincerely interested, could politely asked link. Instead say pull ass. reasonable people gonna think wouldn‚Äôt believe anyway trolling. 

You created negative response. step back take equation re-read wrote. Don‚Äôt sense bit aggressiveness negativity?

Just trying help here. great Sunday.  Well, messages God area religious thing, they.

It goes back ""Don't eat apples."" got argument someone said (paraphrasing) ‚Äúolder people lived lives,‚Äù somehow older makes remainder life objectively worth less someone younger. 

There people actually don‚Äôt care lot people dying, simply dying older. Fucking scum, ask me. Every person‚Äôs life valuable, couldn‚Äôt believe actually make argument. Ehhh that‚Äôs true. People acting like it‚Äôs people states never took serious begin with. They‚Äôve acted like jump. Deserve? No. want sympathy I‚Äôm dumpster. boat. company done. Pretty good job this, every return work date pushed forward. first chance they‚Äôll consider early September.

I feel fortunate role could transition seamlessly WFH, it‚Äôs ‚Äúwait out‚Äù family. whose employment affected, irate everyone didn‚Äôt take seriously first place. still even sure long immunity last you‚Äôve exposed

Well, saying 2-3 months short lived. guess plain fucked means vaccine work.   Now? ""Screw you, got mine"" prosperity gospel look me. I'm actually wearing goddamn mask properly NM competent state level response. Take tribes lock 50% cases go away, making us top 3 categories. 

We experiencing surge reclosing bars indoor dining. 

But starting see thw limitations good state level response. AZ TX blowing up. many border towns states, NM hospitals closest ones used going to. Many live / work across border. NMs go AZ TX work vice-versa, negating measures. sink levels. full 20% current cases state residents, people travel state work (or play, sigh..). exploding, puts natural lower limit well do, unfortunately. USA 60x population country (Scotland), yesterday USA 10,000x cases.

It scary see worry average Americans would able figure Manitoba first place, completely safe. Everyone afraid dying I'm afraid hospital bills. (There's tab Europe whole) Russian stuff fake news dnc hack site well

There's evidence love you! Economic Shutdown 2 - Greatest Depression

""No one's ever created depression big mine. large, powerful.."" 

I'm another shutdown, would ensure mass numbers defaults. We're depression already, market realized yet new moronic traders / investors keep buying whilst elite de-risk massively inflated valuations, Federal Reserve buying new government bonds massive deficit spending thing keeping things feeling ""ok"" right soon run out.

Commercial real estate collapse, hopefully residential real estate too, millennials deserve chance get homes fair valuations.

If USA proper shut begin could gotten away short, deep recession, instead it'll massive debt default deleveraging event two shut downs. better get right time though, countries correctly leaving USA behind, economically speaking.

I've said start, way relatively ok economic outcomes highly effective, strict response. better controlled virus becomes, robust expedited economic recovery be. Yep need Sorry hear friend. Make daily phone calls her. Even starts turn corner, keep daily calls going least week that. Encourage go back ER another sudden crash. Wtf man mother that‚Äôs scary :/ say Trump supporting friends reply with:

""The numbers inflated faking it. political stunt Dems. Watch election go away."" fact understand germ theory disease makes extremely unlikely ever achieve herd immunity. It‚Äôs based SARS vaccine made years ago. modified combat spike protein COVID-19. believe Moderna vaccine similar farther along. ask me, Oxford vaccine one want. It‚Äôs developed pharmaceutical company.

Also Moderna vaccine caused negative side effects concerning. doses likely won‚Äôt receive vaccinated. That's fir breaking quarantine. Can't even go public mask period. Yeah I‚Äôm NC feel isolated. Nobody know taking seriously. One friends telling great last month been, got tattoo piercing started dating (and therefore fucking) someone new. it‚Äôs like okay glad you‚Äôre happy guess don‚Äôt actually give fuck?? good weak means absolutely nothing considering high risk father pandemic. feel alone do. fucking sucks seems spam accounts do. Either post /r/FreeKarma4U similar. Innocent? know, fact, spread Covid others?

They put toilet paper rack next dumpsters grave people wipe shitting it. remember, though, UK includes deaths weeks ago daily statistics. 40 people actually died yesterday, many deaths counted yesterday June.

By comparison, Spain add people died three days announcement figures. 3.2 million people.  There‚Äôs nobody feel worse normal people trapped states politicized mask wearing. I‚Äôm two early hot spots, heart breaking watch south south west society take warnings granted. 100k dead east coast people head far asses took zero lessons American dead. heart goes family time. sorry you‚Äôre environment. Best luck. started making masks MAGA export USA.

I would saved lot people made money. said Ebola eradicated vaccine provides good model containment... position act vector, otherwise put anyone else danger, fine - wear mask. If, likely, go shops, doctor's, work, come close contact people, putting people unnecessarily danger. independent community, rather benefit it, would hope feel sort concern wellbeing others.

I curious though wear mask? send one tweet day wearing mask. Thats brother two unconfirmed cases testing available non risk groups got Probably people form non US origins woke missed sarcasm. (or unintended sarcasm? would know) Jesus protect stupidity... thoughts, exactly. Yeah, hospital excuse. think testing base would say it. What's source numbers? anyone even know ""everything else done properly"" even is, given dearth evidence? Let alone whether rules abided? cock-sure confidence people's assertions thing baffling sometimes. Yup Chinese new year everyone travels see family ThEyRe mUcH tEsTiNg People still mentality kids can't get virus.  Isn‚Äôt breaking rule #4 subreddit? Seems sort liberal hothead circlejerk vaccine, atleast 2021 imagine. seems indication herd immunity far. deep another full lockdown, thats would take get control.  Agreed. There's literally reason virus mutate weaker. There's environmental pressure so. spreading fine without weaker. seems mirror trends TSLA share price. SInce correlation *always* implies causation, I'm wondering Musk suspiciously large factories tunnels.

&amp;#x200B;

*This conspiracy bullshit brought History Channel* super long, seems. give vaccinations people 50 hits much worse.
 say, think shingles, get doctor ASAP start treatment. made whole experience much easier. Everyone telling horrendously painful would mild incessant itching skin, rash size iPad. feel quite lucky part.

Interestingly, doctor said patients 30s presenting shingles stress factors, unproven theory don‚Äôt get boosters immune system older generations raised us, kids younger us chicken pox vaccine.  Whatever rant irrelevant quarantining infected canadas futures looking bright, everyones debt theres 2 million canadians working federal assistance rn hospitals empty. upvotes? with..... anything? jesus. cares know, there's god damn thing election.

That's correct. There's nothing *willing* wait four months vote. relevant thread idea happening yet? I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs like actually nearly tied wealth thought was? It‚Äôs super weird em virus disproportionately effects specifically black Brown Latino people. It‚Äôs crazy tends happen far right populist leaders. Sorry break news, called developed free world done far worse percentage population good bit developed world. 

Oh yeah, buy numbers, must false, can't low - suppressing numbers domestically - welcome USA! plus side: X good music high school! would pick random grouping Europe? cherry picking badly hit areas.

EU whole meaningfully people US given existing entity formed create convincing COVID stats, obviously cherry picked. fast going explode here? That's many people. Utah makes Florida look sane. what‚Äôs wrong America bad US is, UK 50% deaths per capita (only Belgium more), less ""worst hit""?

Of course, UK greatly reduced cases (by strong lockdown, ending), whereas US piling new cases like there's tomorrow, US certainly catch figure. American, would add zeroes 2 you. I'm really sure mean. statistics back claim? thing react disproportionately something's inherent nature? Maybe something incorrectly autocorrected throwing Lol!!! Dr. Henry represents public health side...and remaining sides take advice educated medicine....or 'her' instance. going move goalposts again? conversation Arizona numbers vs EU. chart US vs EU. We‚Äôve already agreed US terrible job managing pandemic. You‚Äôre still missing point‚Äî you‚Äôre comparing Arizona‚Äôs peak EU‚Äôs trough. look NY numbers look lot like EU numbers went first wave couple weeks apart other. listen bullshit. vote matter. Voting gives mandate.

Do waste time. vote. 0% voter turnout way country ever changes, facebook population stomach revolution. Kind regretting user name picked couple years ago. No, Trump's Ego Altar fact. Even capitalist horrified desicions. Hey I'm 25 too, race ya! George Soros paid trans yet?? lol zero respect 

‚Äúexperimenting‚Äù people lives literally state says you‚Äôll you‚Äôll like it!

Or option 4 resign virus control low positivity, batch many tests together, since seldom get positive. That's China recently tested 1.5 million day. That's Trump. could imposter. Trump would never weak show like that. President reset starters might help. Fauci getting old trump tiny finger wag. top 1% guess! thing US taught us exactly going take.  time wait elections. Essentially nothing pandemic response change January even take months get back track mention done fuck prepare vaccine deployment.

Americans crossroads. wait election process complete despite Constitution worth paper written administration reclaim birthright take back country force. much health worth? I'd fly hazmat suit. Maybe they‚Äôre still shipped China I've gotten mildly annoyed way people repeat words like sheep. actually pretty interesting. 6 feet thing. Europe 2 meters. Ok, maybe that's close enough 6 feet, clearly particles spread beyond 6 feet significant chunk time. 6 feet help, far perfect (though one follows 6 feet anyway).

Social distancing gets repeated again. ""global pandemic."" feels redundant. know dictionary definitions allow pandemic mean across continent, example, whole world, global term already. fact, Hungarian example, word pandemic literally world-epidemic. English course, people repeat hear. Clearly people know difference unless they're good Greek roots, sticking ""global"" front serve purpose.

People repeat ""lockdown"" ""quarantine"" internet kind cool new hashtag something. Americans pretty much idea lockdown actually means. still remember videos Italy back March. never that, let alone China-style lockdown.

Pretty much one actually thinks. looked instagram crossfit gym area got shut second time due pandemic, they're workouts park 30-person groups social distancing (and masks). one coaches gym owners dies, single person care. Honestly, frightened. Maybe death, happens see hospital bill. shutdown essential point. I'm interested solution actually solve problem. Northeast probably sealed point. ruin success story? Look happened Louisiana. wifes super high risk. masked ""Mask help"" infamous speech. tv got flabbergasted turned wife said, ""well that's complete bullshit, tell help, stock up"" would approximately 4,000,000 cases folks. ‚ÄúNobody could seen coming.‚Äù Dr Fauci one revered respected physicians United States.

I'm working school system that's looking options opening up.

I feel like read somewhere someone recommended opening K-5 spreading schools. anyone know who/where?  Yah. banking it, still cautious. remember time thinking weirdest illness I‚Äôve ever had. little. late. Wrong would expect chance running someone covid Disney like 1 20 rather 1 100. People willing go Disney probably engaging risky behaviour like going bars, refusing masks grocery store etc.

I go restaraunts, bars, malls, crowded beaches. people need buy groceries. probably ones wearing masks.

So try give wide berth shop every two weeks lunchtime store empty. Evidence mounting COVID vascular disease presents respiratory symptoms, hope narrative gains traction stop making comparisons influenza.  want good person consider they're short sighted still human beings lessons learn, contract covid19 learn them.

I consider good person, genie offered end corporate kapitalism, cost hundred (or even 50,000) upper-class assholes died Covid‚Äì19, would take it. economic system ongoing violence time end it. US healthcare dead number 70,000 per year. Millions people unnecessarily imprisoned bunch rich fucks private prison industry (which fucking exist) need ""inputs"". people burning planet running country ground experience misfortune, cheer. done self-inflicted disease, better.

As student history, I'm nervous violence think last resort. possible, I'd rather solve corporate problem legal, electoral, nonviolent means. view is: nonviolence possible, violence necessary. reservations violence collateral damage legitimacy movement compassion *ancien regime* (which I, frankly, space heart for). strong willed woman. hope beats shit COVID ""some""

Lol That‚Äôs 90% rides Disney That‚Äôs main reason think major point needs addressed much don‚Äôt know. recently kids getting Kawasaki disease linked Covid, never heard happened that. there‚Äôs starting proof long term implications lung/brain health. kids get virus it‚Äôs asymptomatic, could still cause damage major organs still developing children That's states stance too. I'm breif contact every single elementary student school daily. Idk they're going staff like me. guess I'll time conversations try keep babies away. Ughh. Thank you, finally Someone reckless moronic idiotic...a donkey-brained person, will.

But seriously, nice way saying someone stupid. Last 7 days‚Äô average 723 per day 586, much cute little theory. Math always wins good news since indicates virus much less deadly feared? Lol bro on? I‚Äôm even talking BK specifically. familiar concept work living? It‚Äôs pretty common situation people settle shitty jobs put food table... Correct accounts. Many said low, New York Spain came incident fatality rates least 1.2%, however, remember fatality fluid depending many things like age distribution infected, many nursing home outbreaks, whether hospitals get overwhelmed etc. CDC assuming perfect protection nursing homes (which possible harsh nursing home lockdown) 0.65 achievable, 0.26 possible recent progress medical treatment. assuming states currently crisis run hospital beds. Thanks link, seems like Texas thing whole US metro area completely skewed dominated data along. even rest country, like rural areas much trouble virus. also first post alluded ""greatest city world"" uhh sure pivot here. Cool story bro. Nice lie end btw. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre paragon road safety. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve never even much glanced phone gone even 1 mph speed limit. I‚Äôm totally sure you‚Äôve never gone work sick. Ever.

Let us worship altar u/Ecwfrk. that's really sensible person saying.

There genuine cases person takes long time recover (which unheard severe viral infections generally mean person still infectious), we're talking purely *statistics*, safe count someone recovered got diagnosed three weeks ago die.

If anything, number people take longer recover probably smaller number people recover quickly (either mild case they're diagnosed later stage infection). anything, three weeks erring side caution probably undercounts number recoveries. time summer! Perfect!.... repost winter They're reporting heavily unknowns lifelong issues may deal surviving covid. I'd rather severely reduced lung cognitive capacity rest life. news, 4000 extra people going get Coronavirus going Walt Disney World... don‚Äôt care political views are. wearing mask endangering people‚Äôs lives, especially must deal consequences recklessness (healthcare workers). supporting wrong side. endangering people.

fines community service common punishment minor crimes like misdemeanors. case aligning punishment consequences reckless actions. I'd worried possible issues surviving thing. Thankfully, everyone excellent healthcare. people believe everything message God. always look meaning something convince it‚Äôs there, whatever want be. Exactly... it‚Äôs big one, fridges won‚Äôt matter. it‚Äôs usually is, easily capacity. fridges for? really don‚Äôt buy explanation, sense people live Tampa Bay believe. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I‚Äôm instructor college courses. slowly moving online try figure logistics Fall semester. It‚Äôs real mess way person classes safe. someone slowly recovering, let tell them: boring cabin fever exactly beg get it. virus joke people understand gravity situation... excellent thing politicians debate next elections. Looking forward parties put forth plans, instead poking holes opponents. Oh man, baaad. They're also really stupid doubt even conscious thoughts. like emotional reactions crazy much money talks country. context ‚Äúimmigrants‚Äù means ‚Äúbrown people‚Äù don‚Äôt actually care status (many Hispanics Arizona American generations), it‚Äôs coded racism. They‚Äôre actually looking discuss immigration policy think there‚Äôs many brown people. medical tourism point point hypocrisy opinions people going countries better lives. Nothing wrong medical tourism immigration (other current government‚Äôs policies medicine immigration beyond backwards) appreciate detailed reply, quote I'm referring to. interview one rallys blowing air spreading hate usual. literally said people choose wear masks like him. bizarre level ignorance narcissism really ever seen anyone institutionalized.
 
I know reply intentionally misleading,  unaware said.  second, thanks misguided incorrect attempt. not, man says 'i hope covid seasonal like respiratory viruses' think I'm playing semantics claiming equal saying virus hoax? Taking ""I HOPE"" sentence changes dramatically whoever edited knew left solely make Trump's take appear even worse already was. bad, correct, never claimed Trump handled well never lied right. Trump underestimated, downright wrong about, oversimplified Covid continues so. 

&amp;#x200B;

All ever said man claim Covid hoax. I'm 100% correct, want fight even though think technically agree everything said.  


You asked henpeck another quotes, I'll keep going list number two.  ‚ÄúWe pretty much shut coming China.‚Äù  


Talking Hannity Feb 2 Super Bowl travel ban China happened 2 days earlier, Trump says ""Well, we've pretty much shut down, coming China. tremendous relationship China... we‚Äôre offering tremendous¬†help. can‚Äôt thousands people coming may problem, coronavirus. So, we're gonna see happens, shut down, yes.""  


""We've shut **it** down,"" virus, ""coming in"", via travel ban enacted 2 days made statement. Go ahead say semantics, context meaning. mean he's never said virus defeated we've won, specific quote misinformation. Fuck that. employees grocery store at? fucking selfish. Unless 65 lived untill seen discounts gunna get! Hang there! I‚Äôm relieved ‚Äúboot chug‚Äù didn‚Äôt mean butt stuff. work lawncare away home. limit interaction customers, much. fuck find place piss grab extra water. plan hunker winter avoid much public humanly possible off-season starts.

I'm fortunate live RI work MA, overall risk low. doesnt make less nervous angry mess. brother works grocery store much exposed am. cant even imagine stress put medical workers. issue CPS I've told this. radar, radar. parents clearly idiots, children punished that. Almost like without centralized vision, there's chaos? Well...I would like conservative number, america may decide double end result own. might want wait weeks talking deaths though. Funniest shit I've ever seen. Got UV smoke? ‚ÄúYou *can* always count *Americans* *do right thing* tried everything else"".

\- Churchill Let burn. There's much brain damage though Well they‚Äôre good job boosting number recovered patients. Best way get recoveries infect people first place! Let try again! 

We getting close. disappointed America elected truly thought enough systems place things get bad. wrong. cracks showing, even pandemic, felt entirely hopeless future country. assumed re-election happening. However, think people middle see bad pandemic race stuff truly now. long people actually go vote, feel like enough sentiment shifted. conversely think getting former supporters (who see he‚Äôs bad country) hate B simply vote help. don‚Äôt mean vote all, skip selecting B ballot. Last time vote independent vote T. time, could vote B.  Roger, Roger. Please elaborate. UK handled poorly. 

The US handled poorly, actively try increase numbers Covid parties, mask denialism, fake medical treatments, racist finger pointing, government took active part stealing medical supplies hospitals could sell corporate cronies would turn sell back government would hand states need via auction-like competitive environment (""states need"" apply liberal states).

I'd also love sources would start actually reporting ""number positive tests per X tests"" figures, way normalized every single country, never hear someone say completely moronic statement again.

If you‚Äôre worried, could get tested arriving South Carolina. path overtake New York within month something drastic isn‚Äôt done.  I'll preface saying I'm mostly looking severance question, that's basically knowledge is. said

The severance issue starts Texas Feds saying individual mandate ACA, says people must health insurance, unconstitutional Congress passed Tax Cuts Jobs Act (TCJA) 2017. argue mandate deemed constitutional Congress' taxing power, Commerce Clause power SCOTUS NFIB v Sebelius. Now, TCJA changed penalty mandate health insurance 0, effectively taking teeth. But, passing TCJA, Congress take mandate ACA, changed effectiveness. California seriously arguing mandate constitutional, severed rest ACA. 

In law, severance refers removal portion law private contract provision later adjudicated invalid. contracts contain severance clause allows invalidated article removed without affecting rest contract. Laws sometimes severance provisions, ACA anything specific individual mandate. Congressional findings, show Congress' intent law meant achieve. 

Both parties' arguments basicly hinging Congressional intent: 2010 Congress' intent prevail, 2017 Congress' (that passed TCJA) intent reign? California House argue 2017 intent keep ACA fully operational, remove individual mandate tax penalty (or incentive, bullshit distinction, imo). Texas Feds argue 2010 Congress passed ACA intended mandate essential entirety ACA. argue without mandate two closely related provisions, ACA fundamentally different piece law Congress intended. So, Texas argues, individual mandate essential ACA, cannot severed it. since district court already decided mandate unconstitutional, entire ACA must also invalidated mandate cannot severed. 

If one inseverable part lawn invalid, whole law cannot stand rule. purposefully given opinion want color anybody else's. wanted inform objectively could. make clear (I'm still lying bed tbf) let know I'll try computer later.

Otherwise, wear mask stupid eventually end... imagine Disney doesn‚Äôt want look like they‚Äôre breaking character, even this. read statistics ? wait cases per hundred, 3.3 million cases, US reached 1% infection rate. Unfortunately, think track CDC's ""worst case"" scenario anywhere 20-60% infected millions dead over. That's opinion, morons refusing wear masks, likely outcome.  conservatives fighting long time contain education ‚Äúevolution blasphemy sex marriage kill you‚Äù they‚Äôve pretty successful far dont want wear mask reasons.

 know say this. mean, denial. wrong. Deaths rising going 1000 day first time next week so.

And re: deaths counted, yes ways measuring going count cases inaccurately whole, US, deaths certainly undercounted. ashamed list, c'mon Washington State WTF! ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) Looks like there's mixed information it.

Quick anecdote - parents moved South Carolina. called two days ago. father greeting neighbor returned New York, without mask.

So yeah. Maybe there's shaky evidence happened. Maybe happen. believe point, proven happened. People get it. Basically we're fucked band set venue fire performing. surprised. Zero leadership national level.

The US developed country. There‚Äôs reason surging cases developed countries getting control.

The ineptitude trump administration almost criminal Sorry, I'd seen three Utah threads today Mormons... bad.

There lack morons state well. :) try telling rookie firefighters well! Will? They've already blaming BLM protests last month, despite evidence indicating otherwise. True, still many people covid deniers end getting sick. get sick. Others mild symptoms long term complications. Additional statistics:¬†


Arizona population:¬†7.279¬†million

Positive cases: 122,467

Percentage: 1.68% Arizona infected COVID-19.

Deaths: 2237 population: 446 million

Positive Cases: 1,292,813

Percentage: 0.29% EU infected COVID-19.

Deaths: 140,953 No. Reported cases meaningless. 
Watch deaths want know going on. 
30% US deaths still New York. 
 
To compare countries actual matters deaths per capita per +1% progress herd-immunity. 
 
NPI also cost life. year lock-down would kill 100k's. 
For example, Arizona achieves herd-immunity three months takes Europe four years Arizona end lot better long-run. Coughing spitting would dumb way end unexpected knee surgery. people blame this. China epicenter countries banned Chinees people (including US). America's epicenter countries ban people countries. really hypocrit. matter helping, matter putting (the safety of) people first (does ring bells?).

Edit: based small list specific misconceptions, I'm assuming, now, irony lmao  based recent study showing lack antibodies short period time, knows herd immunity would even work case covid. I'm really surprised this. thought Europe wide ban. think bitten they'd twice shy. Yes overall surely good sign. Trump absolutely nullified effectiveness potential federal response responsible tens thousands deaths.

But Democrat White House now, think Florida, Texas, Arizona would anything differently? They'd screaming tyranny probably would opened sooner ""pwn libs"". bigger Trump, large part America politicized science, we're seeing deadly results that. F Texas right, asking taking empathetic stance Arizonans, conservatives. Plenty us conservative deaths chaos Intoxicated employees safety issue. People get killed work time. Even accident incident turns drug-related insurance company wants make sure. Otherwise customers fellow employees end pitch pay million dollars Jimmy's meth problem.  birthdays July 4th wanted celebrate went dinner. examples? position masks early huge fuckup regardless PPE supply. I‚Äôm aware anything recent CDC. expected. data isn‚Äôt support anything like official number. Even 0.26% cite wasn‚Äôt official number, best estimate time models. 

To find infection fatality rate, need reliably know number infections number deaths. number deaths well known. Based number excess deaths baseline, actual number COVID-19 deaths US probably 30% higher official figures. infection data is, course, vastly worse. It‚Äôs likely true number infections 10x higher official case numbers.

If search something like ‚ÄúCOVID infection fatality rate,‚Äù you‚Äôll find lot recent scientific estimates number. lack data, estimates vary wildly. You‚Äôll find estimate well 1%, estimate well 0.5%. ones I‚Äôve turned fall within 0.5-1% range gave.  Getting big britches trying figure shit out....

Seriously though grateful dead rising grave.....0 I'm denying anything.

I'm saying US government failed multiple levels includes federal response state response.

And New York could done better proactive.

And I'm wrong. hospitals filled due Covid. death rates increasing. due testing.  Hint: Bill Barr don‚Äôt care voters anymore. democratic process plan stay power. point, people dying elderly, poor, POC‚Äì people whose infections fine dandy Trump admin. almost seems worth flee country wait out. it‚Äôs gotten bad one wants us. make anti mask people feel like they‚Äôre trapped sinking ship? agree everything said justification it. ""experts"" saying illogical things people every right question them. get pass evidence position authority, especially authority lied people first and, despite evidence, [told wear reasoning needed save masks healthcare professionals change fact lied need overcome ignorance distrust. honest masks start people would much less skeptical now. 

That said, there's tons evidence coming many different sources saying thing: masks work.  Words meaning. Airborne transmission respiratory droplet transmission. 
It's matter scale, transmission droplets means there's limit far spread. Gravity pulls droplets ground. airborne transmission stay suspended air spread stay air longer time. would also mean flimsy mask limited use, air would slip open gap mask user. Similarly would also leave mask gap user coughing breathing.

There's (not much moment) evidence points direction might airborne transmission well, yet concluded. 

What write meant masks. Read is, trying make distinction actually know rumours tells us (even though rumours might later proven correct). supposed get married yesterday, moved November optimistically went April. That's already looking like go sort small gathering. No, think people understand difference, it‚Äôs hard tell person asymptomatic presymptomatic it‚Äôs late, essence treat everyone pre No, didn‚Äôt really want haircut, it‚Äôs good see you‚Äôre swallowing you‚Äôre told without question. 

Kind explains support masks lockdowns. really asking ""how allowed"" rather ""why done something like now?"" fucking embarrassment, plain simple. meant countries US vaccine. exactly. scheduled people cannot congregate ahead time. also full scale would've past... groups characters, bands, etc, parade around Magic Kingdom. I've seen several live streams YouTube.

The band, particular, struck problematic. one tubists, example, COVID-19, seems like playing tuba large crowd would superspreader event. pretty mind-boggling. Euro fucking disaster, say someone lives Eurozone Country. 

I know Reddit people believe US Ethno State Bernie still win!1!1!1 reality US Dollar accepted global currency. freedom I'm fucking scared go anywhere!

So personally feel uncomfortable, everyone else entire planet well? know rant China covers Covid numbers? People said China report 5% true numbers.

Those ignorant denials, fuelled Trump propaganda. hard evidence China massively faked numbers. understandable, even people like Trump initially struggle grasp catastrophically bad administration's response covid look elsewhere answers. Yes, local Chinese leaders initially denial extent outbreak, also describe early response outbreak many countries, even though countries prior knowledge danger involved? different? would call Trump's early statements?

Us westerners like think China nasty, inept, corrupt dictatorship, there's truth that, know look progress China nation made last 30 years conclude smart, competent people power making lot wise, informed decisions.

In many parts China, gates apartment complexes communities welded shut one entrance could monitored. Police every street corner make sure people public distanced, wearing masks, good reason out. places allowed one person per household leave house every three days groceries, places completely banned residents leaving rely deliveries (many parts China excellent delivery services). Major roads (motorways/interstates) leading cities blockaded, smaller towns even destroyed roads. 

Crucially, China deployed armies medical workers equipped supplies hotspots, alleviating capacity issues nationwide coordination effort. Meanwhile US, Trump left states fend themselves, people going churches, parties theme parks, beaches packed, large crowds protesting, masks ""too inconvenient"", ""anti freedom"" politicised. Taking consideration, would expect China US' outcomes remotely similar? Conspiracists lack cognitive barrier real imaginary events.

Essentially, anything imagine value anything else they've ever heard of. Serious question: eating ramen form worship pure blasphemy? need know (I might fault too). continental numbers largely fraudulent, look tests per million places carried dystopian AF. Ugh. v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489 (1999), landmark case[1]¬†in the¬†Supreme Court United States¬†discussed whether constitutional¬†right travel¬†from one state another.[2]¬†The case reaffirmation principle citizens select¬†states¬†and way round.[3] Exactly, idiots think voting Biden office going erase virus fix problems lmao.

Those mere trials, child. tested defensive capabilities. tested offensive capabilities. kraut know weakness: weapons powered bullets.

By time saying stores already pretty much sold out, iirc. 

I'm saying government mess up. I'm simply issue term ""lying."" Trump lied. Fauci not. made statement based knew time. He's admitted wrong. everyone run around saying ""Fauci LiAR"" shoulders largest part blame anti-maskers Trump talking point yet another deflection. lot people know CA taken trips AZ party looser restrictions last weeks.

That's got proud of. openly elected officials forgotten refuse job ensure safety populace act best interest placate loud voices room. almost they're nothing intentionally. refuse right thing lynch pin me. country divided since, what, Vietnam? vote useless governors administration, screwed coming former conservative turned independent. Screw party lines. Vote right people job. Period. really want start theory crafting looking around, level ineptitude response crisis country suicidal leaders subtly facilitating it. I'm hopeless. american claim us bigger eu. Go read paper yourself. supports wrote. He's also guy kept saying masks effective bother them. agree he's good resource smart, mask stance really irks me.  Massachusetts 8th cases state country though... got $100 allowance home desk/chair.... ""Watch PB split"" - Florida remember 'operation Jade Helm' conspiracy theories? half expecting right wing theory coronavirus excuse FEMA execute coup. near impossible now. think something else.

Cause way convincing country go back full lockdown again. way congress going say another trillion keep people alive. way something huge going pass fix problem long term way.

The power effectively lockdown wasted federal government job tell states lock down, wear masks use social distancing. failed left states. made worse leadership country making political acting like mob boss.

There power say let's again. enough people would follow that. It'd worthless.

So need half assed measure now. options that. states done well increasing cases. Allow cops pull state plates. work state need proof. traveling states. Enforce masks social distancing.

That least let states control maintain that. states get shit together.

A full restart ain't happening. Cracking would help. Since cops overpaid go get something fill quotas jaywalking, go active plazas places business enforce masks. Write tickets shit fill quotas.

That's best half assed restart. Lockdown nationwide ain't happening without troops every state making shit worse, restart. say unsubstantiated. Antibody testing new york points 20% entire state already infected people can‚Äôt stay home, like food workers, teachers, kids medical personnel. lot spread also due system failure. healthcare, cannot afford bills without going back work, government gave us $1200 10 weeks ago expected keep us home. 

I think one biggest differences, people mention enough. Masks whatever, Canada getting everything control people wearing masks anyway, government assistance allowing people stay home....while perfect, really helped slow spread. 
At one point read google data showed half people going out. Anecdotally, 1.5 hour commute work 45 minutes. 

This mask thing kind overblown, social distancing hygiene think way important, many Canadians took shit seriously, affored opportunity stay home, either via work home, government assistance. 

Argue long term effects CERB program, permanently lost jobs will, strictly terms COVID...those things really helped. way around? 'China 30 times imported cases Europe/America' 

 response probably be: 'This indication China lying' argumentative, truth. Go read paper yourself. Asymptomatic transmission around 3 6 percent, exactly line Maria VK said weeks ago. seen massive success NY regional approach. regions bars indoor dining open 8 weeks now. Almost every business back person increase. reason: one goes areas. tourism travel. Fuck that. Shit really bad months. He‚Äôs optics. Probably realizes giving shit going cost momentum attempt re-elected avoid potential jail time he‚Äôs longer untouchable. 

He doesn‚Äôt give shit anyone own. Whatever continually viewed lens. hasn‚Äôt earned anything else. can‚Äôt decide give shit many people died and/or financially destroyed. know anything long-term yet, survivors definitely paint nasty picture short-term recovery.

Sad say, little late. Wild West government citizens completely disregarded university‚Äôs research. 

‚ÄúThe findings study suggest face mask wearing general public implemented nationwide without delay, even masks homemade relative low quality. measure could contribute greatly controlling COVID-19 pandemic, benefit greatest conjunction interventions reduce community transmission, social distancing.‚Äù - May 1, people downvoted disagree, instead voting, help understand. want intelligent, respectful debate disagreement Im sure wanna inherit it....because seems like countries taking america apart like Rome.... Happening anyone it'll happen me!

What right infringed upon mask ordinances? limit ability free speech.

Mask ordinances project everyone's right free speech allows people continue living thus speaking, writing, expressing yourself. 

Not wearing mask free speech, wiping blood someone free speech. harmful, dangerous, presents great safety concerns. think ""If someone jumps cliff gonna jump too"" scenario applies here. ignorance, willful domestic terrorism. Okay, logic every 1 case catch testing miss 9 others..., 10% US actually infected. current infection rates continue americans got corona virus. death toll would 10X now. 1.37 MILLION americans would died.  Arizona one stupid states one live love UAE. guess solve problems AC burning fossil fuels including Italy? wish world leaders would speak happening States. Shaming leader might thing makes try get control. endangering rest world much. leaders practically committing genocide via virus us. sounds hyperbolic feels. Probably 20 younger. guess Reddit though think tell someone age suffering stress anxiety 50/50 chance winding vent. sub really circle jerk fear.  nearly enough. place = broken page. time = right now. I'm US military temporarily living UK.

I'm glad family instead home. UK *amazing* COVID-19 response, miles ahead America. Makes sad basically seeing home country crumble afar.  Free dumb

FTFY  Another thing, everyone visits White House get tested test positive, self quarantine test negative, meeting. knows needs do, he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt care citizens. government would pay people stay home shut could backpedal. Instead we're opposite. I'm convinced matter many get sick die, money matters US that's it. also week behind analyzing tests. Historically we've averaging 10% tests taking week processed. past week 30-50% week ago. We've two days 5k+ cases (based test date) June 29 &amp; 30. still tests analyzed anything recent that. Based rough calculations sitting somewhere around [80-100k tests yet flat ridiculous. new record high 867 Friday May ask state? Thanks someone lives AZ tell it‚Äôs pretty simple, Governor moron. You‚Äôre comparing NY sensible leadership actually trying make difference. Governor first, didn‚Äôt even want close schools March, reason school districts said screw it, we‚Äôre going close whether Governor mandates not. Eventually nearly every district shutdown hand essentially forced shut schools. came time shutdown businesses basically made exceptions pretty much everything, listed ‚Äúpersonal hygiene‚Äù business like salons barbers ‚Äúessential business‚Äù well hundreds golf courses. Basically never really shut all. opened fully Memorial Day, tell weekend people everywhere, bars, restaurants, everywhere masks. cases began really spiking June July he‚Äôs outright shutdown, mandatory mask mandate. week finally conceded put executive order limiting restaurants 50% capacity dine-in. you‚Äôre thinking WTF, yeah that‚Äôs thing, WTF that‚Äôs really you‚Äôre going do? comes masks he‚Äôs put mandate, refuses so, many city mayors putting mandates helped somewhat. 

And might say don‚Äôt rely Gov, smarter. I‚Äôd say sure, yeah, us half us dgaf ruin rest us. So, need actual mandates that‚Äôs thing people respond unfortunately. honest it‚Äôs going get worse. 116 degrees weekend may say great, virus doesn‚Äôt well high temps, might great spreading closed quarters 75 degrees AZ summer that‚Äôs are. Nobody leaves AC except go car. 

tl;dr Governor worst. Biden elected, he's going sign executive order everyone believe science. I'm doctor, I've pretty much come conclusion stick bunch kids poorly ventilated room 6 hours day masks social distance may matter much. 

Again, low prevalence test trace, makes sense. make sense much US right now. Keep closed? even closed properly right now! far Americans still sneaking vacation. One word...Leadership. look Florida. governor refuses acknowledge Covid surging hell-bent opening schools Arizona pride right guys? None paid anything remotely close normal times. crazy. makes feel safer xenophobic pricks, unlike red hats. that‚Äôs last week‚Äôs ice cream tasted funny... Exactly, she‚Äôs opinionated nothing change mind. her, facts prove wrong opinions. plot sow division, spread distrust confusion, help bought ascend positions power. doesn‚Äôt need omnipotent, even good, work. echo-chamber Facebook groups, strategic ads, laundered political donations really need. also play sides well non-political medical conspiracies,they get foreign boost troll farms. 

Whatever effective muddying water. happened long propaganda existed well. It‚Äôs lot easier role social media plays lives. looks weak. /s

I mean many reasons. wearing mask. Dipshit personally responsible many deaths. 100 percent say least one person died pandemic stupidity. Yeah starts pretty low individuals, like $50 something doubt there's going ton enforcement unless people really shits it. Back March personally moved footage Italy, Spain NYC showing overflowing hospitals, people ventilators filling corridors nurses coming across almost desperate. already taking disease seriously videos made threat really clear obvious me.

Is medical personnel scared lose jobs (illegal film hospitals?), bad TX, FL AZ reasons stations show shocking panic inducing reality check footage hospitals? mayor mengene trending nick name them? Sunt satui de? Plaja, iesit parc? Sa fim seriosi - nici 10% nu au raspectat ordonantele militare, se plangeau ca luau amenzi si ca ei nu cred. La noi tara s-a facut oricum ce s-a vrut, cu amenzi sau nu. De aia nu sunt plajele pline..

It‚Äôs sad it‚Äôll prob happen places like Florida. Ditto, May unexpectedly laid off.

Murica #1 baby! degree. know IFR hovers within range 1%. make totally correct point without making totally false one (or multiple ones case), though.

I made point immunity risks millions deaths heavily focused anyone has. Misinformation still quashed discouraged pops up, disagreeing notion obviously wrong. Going full Trumpian defend something *agree* bad, good. get trump saying says ‚Äúif don‚Äôt test coronavirus don‚Äôt many cases‚Äù. I‚Äôm fairly confident countries EU aren‚Äôt testing much US naturally getting higher positives tests. 

I still believe doesn‚Äôt want people get tested looks like complete failure also America shit poor job far handling virus really doesn‚Äôt matter much tests countries gonna somewhere last place  need least keep office!!!!!!

Every conservative death literally buying species better chance survival. Weeping like shedding tears terrorist bomb maker accidentally blowing early. Heart disease #1 cause death United States would take 5 years heart disease deaths equal 1% population. 1% massive number novel disease. 

It would take 50 100 years flu deaths kill equivalent 1% population. Get clue.  Clap clap clap... Deep Heart Texas makes think understand even simplest statistics?

Even do, wilful ignorance thing too. That's good. can't tell many people come local range buy gun use need it. even offer free training decline. consider 32 deaths 60x population good point make. numbers Arizona going next week. This. Shit. Is. Deliberate. 

They want voters scared, less votes = R‚Äôs office Stop using math tell us stupid are!  Americans never going sacrifice one summer greater good. Summer almost weird, ritual-like air here. Becky can't post ""summer vibing"" bikini pics bar, Brett can't jog along waterfront maskless, point life?

I tend think main explanation

Let's forget deaths lag hospitalizations, numbers may look great couple weeks. week ago people still saying ""daily deaths dropping."" much now. Yes is, thank God. lot people don‚Äôt realize though. I‚Äôve tell uninsured friends get tested (and get tested anywhere, shitty public clinic) they‚Äôre shocked. think orange hair grumpy old man defected Nov, US start plan school reopening. long orange hair dude holding office, pretty much fucked. Idk europe still deaths per day US. happen common cold there's one cold virus, dozens? Like body makes antibodies one anything different one? collectively call different viruses ""the common cold"". Almost like New York curve starting January ended already, states hitting curve now. really aren‚Äôt bright. 

If New York testing per capita, they‚Äôd 100k day peak. It‚Äôs estimated 20% state already infected. Stop ignorant jackass. Yay towards less deadly infectious ...

Really, feel bad guys. try pity you, easily lead feeling superior, people everywhere still people, we're generally - people good people. incredibly sad hear deaths, number sick people presumably insurmountable amount debt this. I'm glad speaking Thanks. I'll definitely this! Arizona can‚Äôt get enough STUPID. us favor California, stay fuck away! going miss you, don‚Äôt want here. Yeah, surprised automod remove it. 

But funny people saying Trump 4 months late telling us wear masks 4 months ago. ""experts"" telling us masks ineffective shortage. mean Trump keeps saying death totals disasterous ~~healthy~~ mix people trying get last kicks apocalypse people want demonstrate think hoax/blown proportion. hallmark symptom ME/CFS fatigue (long story, people screwed up), post-exertional malaise (PEM). focus fatigue wrong, ME/CFS feel tired, feel sick, like mix bad cold, hangover jet lag. includes fatigue way acute infection does, extreme lethargy nothing normal tiredness. wide range symptoms, including neurological dysautonomic. I've read hundreds COVID cases much like it. symptoms vary person person fluctuate lot. hard predict sometimes relapse delayed hours days.

PEM basically means much, severe cases brushing teeth, get sicker, symptoms increase last weeks, months, even years. strong relapsing-remitting course. people improve months recover. relapse years later. Unknown whether illness simply unfortunate infection brings back.

But closest experience good old infection. Calling chronic fatigue syndrome insulting calling Parkinson's disease chronic shaking syndrome. flat wrong. people seem milder course could mostly summed fatigue range goes way level disability means dark silent room, alone pain, rest one's life. Without medical support often without form support.

It's terrible disease made much worse medical denial gaslighting. best advice rest standard clinical practice gaslighting, ignoring symptoms exercise, makes illness worse. Medicine screwed completely. Hopefully changes soon already affects way many people, least 20M best estimates. patient community begging help decades medical institutions simply give fig. Ahh yes ole ‚Äúpresident trump blame virus‚Äù nonsense. Get fuck outta hereüòÇ herd immunity achieved humanity , thats push flu vaccinations yearly.

If 95% nurses / techs / doctors / housekeeping hospital get flu shot (and flu shot succesfully predicted one actually ends culrpit) ""herd"" nurses effectively immunized staff patients hospital acquired flu. let republicans forget us. That's do. case anyone doubts statement:

Active cases:

Canada: 27,308 
USA: 1,729,967

Canada population: 37.59 
USA population: 328.2 M

USA Canada population ratio: 8.73 

If USA equal Canada's handling covid, would expect USA 239,398 active covid cases. 1,729,967 active cases, **7.25x** Canada per capita.

And mentioned - going go up. Yesterday, Canada 221 new cases. USA 61,719. **31.99x** Canada had, per capita. dont want old people get corona, let say many old people WANT die. grandmother sick many years pain walks, says would like see husband heaven. painful watching saying this. Anecdotal scientific. Also making random conclusions two different infections one long one without reasoning. Maybe worst article Winning case wondering, Arizona hot hell, virus fine. um ill take UV light thing developing Love it! Great food music scene people live great. motto ""One Human Family"" people really live it. little crime, almost comical. expensive, wages (in best times) nearly meet cost living. Hurricane season another huge negative, summer heat &amp; humidity unbearable. 

Hubs always say lucky ride pandemic here. water 6-7 days week swimming, boating sandbars, paddle boarding; activities get us house completely social distanced. 

When blows over, please come visit!  yep, somebody touched face shit i'd seeing red even really knew happened  it! quit Facebook 8 years ago; mental health definitely improved Well I‚Äôd like say cases per day seem pretty good correlation high population (of idiots mind you) Sure can. gatherings 5 10 people dont live household disobey get fine. Maybe NYC hit peak months ago rest us catching up. Since, know, NYC much densely packed rest country.

Curious, whole world thought jumping cliff would protect eeevil Covid, would it? jump scares design. can't maintain Pareto efficient capitalist society without controlling working class. Class movement terms upward mobility labor assembly detrimental maintenance status quo winners American Casino. 

This surprising American. difference we've hundred years work this. optimistic amongst us might say we're due major systemic changes nations saw first hundred years. Sorry guy damn, remove comma. sarcastic, felt ""so bad testing notice dead people"" giveaway.

So much laughing people using /s suppose.

And yes, obviously, lower percentage positive tests better. felt would come across simple statement except people missed sarcasm pointing Europeans notice someone dead.

Sigh. percents votes. 

That's bad though, Trump got 40% Think much people live apartment, neighborhood, even work office. 

Even 100 death *extra* per day Covid-19 heartbreaking. B-b-but... moar testing! US entered WW II bombing Pearl Harbor Dec 7, 1941 WW II ended Sept 2, 1945 herd immunity never achieved human history

What's this? reach herd immunity without vaccinations? coronavirus era, 1 vote favor stupidity screw whole city don‚Äôt faith that. People still go. Disney shut down, come it‚Äôs open. state jumped 3 - 10 cases day 70-200 cases day almost tied Myrtle Beach. news talking connection two months. Social media filled every single day people still traveling Myrtle Beach. free testing area less 20,000 people week catch people traveled 4th July holiday, almost 4,000 people showed up. overwhelming majority people travelled back .... Myrtle Beach. thing Disney got going might draw many people right expensive is. mean, \*were\* implement strict (Spain Italy style, before) lockdown, there's data suggests it'd take 60 days regain control. Rounding bit Americans morons, we're \*absolute bare minimum\* fucked September. probably longer.  1.5M recovered, 150k dead. basically 10% dying covid get USA.

YEE FUCKING HAW. goddamn hate timeline. kids ? guess right, good job votes mean much. America‚Äôs going great sample study herd immunity though. Spain 5% doesn‚Äôt it, USA going 95%! Sadly, one rather successful. CEOs top executives companies pouring money developing producing vaccine die, we've increased chances survival?

This may come surprise you, there's lot extremely smart, ambitious people conservative also work high places top hospitals pharmaceutical companies United States.

Just clear, company United States produces first effective vaccine able distribute widely, give UK credit, get take ourselves? want make sure we're berating right people here. USA bad, USA can't anything right party line, correct? rate barely creeping up.

We taking single digit percentages well within acceptable margins continued downward trend. 
 
That still doesn‚Äôt explain last time didn‚Äôt take long. 

Unless saying reporting getting slower? brave agree 100% damned sad citizens need instructed government something simple protect one another? would venture guess often people resent government telling too. Cool get volunteers, repurpose EMTs, pay people state. throwing shit fire tinderbox. cannot believe defending something clearly cost many many lives. 


Arizona similar situation right now. put Covid Patients nursing homes? Lives stake, governor Arizona order nursing homes take Covid patients? identify Native American, Red Cliff Chippewa. 

I still stand comment greatest failure. Slavery genocide fucking horrible, (neither exclusive US) willingly letting citizens die ego small can't admit fucking wrong, COVID-19 real whether believe not. ""you - Imma me"" become new mantra.  still wipe everything also. like president power destroying nation, supported party paste-brained voters. Putin certainly smiling, though think anyone else enjoying America's collapse underestimates reach military US collapses failed state. better hope he's REALLY got trump tight choke leash. Florida thought opening Disneyland good idea well. Seems reasonable. I‚Äôm honest Covid 19 Disneyland looked hell lot better overflowing people everywhere Disneyland. Social distancing benefits. Enjoy shithole ‚Äúcountry‚Äù simultaneously collapses. Argentinian here: indeed, 'villas' slums. That's rat.  Anything big rat. Mice get size. Ah good only... Checks calendar.... 4 month pandemic! matter time catch Europe number deaths:  ""but US bigger &lt;insert country handling pandemic can't compare them"" - every dumb fuck MAGA cultist. Even 100,000 cases day would take 9 years get whole population infected. America would need 900,000 cases day infect whole population 1 year.

It's going awhile.   Oh like German Pension system?

Here's problem ""social security"" model.

It relies ever-increasing population fund it.

Contributions saved invested, instead simply redistributed workforce retirees. [There's another word 

This works population pulls baby boom like USA had.  fact baby boomers numerous fertility rate comparatively low leads problems defined benefits far outstripping contributions still working.

So aging population that's going demand social security time be, what, 5 people paying per retiree whole scheme concocted time 15 people paid per retiree?

Germany going baby boom right now.  fertility rate dies years absolutely expect similar crisis 50 years.

And besides this, I'd still rather retirement own.  die pension, can't pass kids. 401(k) hand, will. husband social worker nursing home Florida spent past four months everything power keep residents safe connecting families regular basis. literally meets people outside building show use video calling apps (because spouses children residents older too) facilitates call residents iPad. dozens times day addition regular duties. 

Employees screened daily tested weekly. Opening facilities face face visitation right would cause huge outbreaks multiple deaths. Aah, knew reaction going get China Flu statement...

Sounds quite fascist you, calling somebody subhuman. Congrats ""inclusion"" points. would fit well Auschwitz, handling ""subhumans"".

Or, would prefer company Hutu Power? **MONTHS** federal government essentially crippling certain states' efforts combat virus? happen forget current admin supposed ready this, plan place it, literally responsible states? fuck think government for? fucks sake literally stealing PPE states. It‚Äôs disappointing floating idea fucking US President something sure would work. stupid cunt. Think environmental impact millions people drive cars every day. People get tax credit working home. *and everything fire. Americans don‚Äôt understand want means though. Probably cause EU test well US. testing everyone. greatest testers world. testing huge.

If Korea agrees this, pretty strong endorsement US lying itself, actively hoping China worse despite evidence implying absolutely (though given Chinese government's ability lie impunity, sympathize skepticism).

They could add Taiwan, NZ bunch others.

I expect travel bubbles continue grow merge. Northern Europe one emerging (with Sweden pointedly excluded). Yah necessarily good news borders can‚Äôt closed? constitution actually say that? borders won‚Äôt closed it‚Äôs due bad leadership knowing founding fathers would state America in. Yes freedom important, people living healthy lives alive apart freedom  It‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs old people. one cares them. /s 100% agree way 70k positive test days gonna conintue yield death numbers 1000 day first time since Brexit hope Brits get deserve stay fuck Europe. Hope people taking seriously get healthy. US less deaths EU daily still...     I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs every liberals excuse lol different story. Lmfao bro, 40% small businesses arent coming back lockdowns. Idk live, TONS shit went bankrupt. GNC, chuck e cheese, 24 hour fitness, hertz....just couple right top remember BIG companies. 40%of small companies...you know what, idea talking about.

 pawn ideology, large portion pop wasnt waving Confederate flags demanding wear maks. heard like 5 people got killed chaz. Oh, somebody got killed yesterday saying lives matter, 40 plus day endless protests 'opression'. Spreading virus. Americans say trumps fault lol 

Get head sand, idea what's going sounds it. king rules forever son.  it‚Äôs Internet never know found good Atlantic article might explain despite fact cases higher, seeing vastly smaller death %age April. see plenty trump signs upstate NY.

And normal signs. Effigies, trucks decals, 40 foot flags, etc. Blood O2 gradually lowering, lungs slowly starting accumulate fluid, microclots &amp; systemic inflammation starting kinds different organs :/ 

""don't know exact. Younger you."" either, still people making point. question comparing testing rate looks like? US *ton* testing. don‚Äôt think would make difference obviously wondering. No. overweight. Again...NO physical issues precipitated this. can‚Äôt people take statement face value? bad hot outside. Since UV rays basically kill virus instantly, gave Arizonans Maricopa county false sense security January since AZ first state report coronavirus case (ASU teaching aide returning visiting relatives Wuhan). Since nice outside, everyone outside virus barely spread. east coast, however, cities like NYC still cold, people went inside heating without masks on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cases NYC could significantly slowed March everyone wore masks. However, wearing masks would helped Arizonans time nice out. Arizonans reason wear mask inside, sun can't kill virus. cases rising March, went outside first time since january, appaled see 10% people wearing masks. people wearing people exposed public choice old live alone. sad. selfish actions old cringy Millenials (age 25-40) responsible majority daily positive cases Maricopa county. summer NYC people outside cases near 0, Boomers reap negligence Millenials sowed. get tl;dr Roger Stone situation? tried look up, news flooded stories people condemning Trump hard trace story back far. EU27

They are. stuff help individuals. manage people work people schedule time vote give little leniency lunch duration go vote. could offer work co workers cover go vote. volunteer drive people polls help people get people registered. Peer pressure also works motivate close friends. instructions unclear, dick stuck toaster. send help.  don‚Äôt think many people understand word economy you‚Äôd already see huge effects it‚Äôs done month shut downs. industries may never come back (Movie theatre, arcades, bars, many small businesses). got 1 thing right one cares economy everyone trying figure pay months rent. many people businesses live pay check paycheck miss one that‚Äôs it‚Äôs can‚Äôt keep making money it‚Äôs over. one gonna freeze rent payments pandemic already saw happen. It‚Äôs quick buck it‚Äôs survival people. bucks pay bills. Stimulus checks create inflation even worse economy road.

Edit: going back reading wrote didn‚Äôt really justify claims except shit America opinions. WW2 one biggest economic booms America pretty much got us Great Depression. Instead talked America trying take credit. get EU. We're sorry got really drunk let Trump become president. We'll try get shit together point something probably not. There‚Äôs also spike that‚Äôs hitting near Dover North Rehoboth beach. 

Thats reason spikes even beach house owners Democrat, that‚Äôs point. hate seeing Reddit politicize virus. mean also get lot cases tens millions people go protest middle pandemic...but Republicans fault I'm sure. Japan recent numbers skyrocketing .. +410 cases yesterday r0 1.8 

this headline makes sense. Cute hold trump responsible people think it‚Äôs okay wear mask. words, trump directly responsible deaths thousands Americans. 

Should get needle chair users states likely tweet things.""

What point data implications I'm assuming? even collect it, mention it, post it, discuss it, etc truly meaningless seem agree is? Maybe right, look pretty weak....don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs mask‚Äôs fault tho speech? link source? That's Bill burr said, Joe, iirc dunno, I've noticed mask-usage distancing neighborhood relaxing bit (annoying). trust me, none people tourists. I'm willing bet shelves got heavy.

One hope happens many people die suffer lifelong organ damage collateral damage? 

What economic cost caused super spreaders infecting people?

I hear trying say look bigger picture please. stupid people actions spiral affect rest society. not, I'm saying choice take precautions, take seriously. See original comment, want die I'm going feel sorry hurt hurt take precautions. EU less testing US. Less testing = fewer confirmed cases. don‚Äôt see hard understand all. Yup.

And I'm American. Reminds scene recent HBO show Avenue 5. People allow believe space big hoax. want quarantine marooned ship launch airlock die. witnessing it, others join them, continuing believe hoax. filmed pre-corona. scene hit little close home me. Im aware HIV.

HIV immunosuppressive disease.

When immune system sorts things happen body.

COVID19 also goes hard immune system know long term impacts virus going YET.

It destroys healthy cells.

Going herd immunity COVID19 makes much sense going herd immunity HIV.

It doesn't. comes back intentional dismantling mental health system here. people severe undiagnosed untreated illnesses everywhere here. wish snow birds die. Fuckers can't drive worth shit eu hit it‚Äôs peak couple months ago. deaths mostly long sufferers virus. Arizona middle peak (still rising). Arizona‚Äôs death figures month high.   good news subreddit getting less less tags less upvotes. Hopefully change staring positive news New York No, highest certainly top 5 point valid, however, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying, I‚Äôm saying UK great job I‚Äôm saying reason wearing masks (which thread about) side peak. US still hasn‚Äôt seen peak super hot topic you, UK indeed Europe. 
If wore masks hit peak would less deaths?, maybe, isn‚Äôt now. 
If wanted take lessons UK would didn‚Äôt lock soon enough, carried Europe poor old Italy Spain really struggling, (and think key one) didn‚Äôt look old people - shutting schools stopping people working ignored care homes old people suffered hugely. half deaths care homes. Look old people much greater risk general population.   lock state borders already

The US freedom movement states, borders can't closed. Canada Mexico closed borders Americans except emergency exceptional reasons.  deaths per capita lower Scotland England, then? cases Wales even higher again?

You look things up, know.... Even survive corona virus, U.S. proven weak pitiful act wearing thin cover noses mouths renders us incapable breathing anything.

Invade us bring tear gas. doomed. Perhaps Americans deserve suffer? you‚Äôre stupid little empathy human life, can‚Äôt even wear mask prevent giving people virus don‚Äôt deserve live. guess people die aren‚Äôt ones blame, it‚Äôs mainly young people believing they‚Äôre invincible passing older middle aged people stubborn beliefs like anti-vaccines wear mask. example you‚Äôve set world depressing though, even Brazil‚Äôs president followed belittling virus blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

But fair, compare nordic countries happy results, it. America, fuck yeah? I'm asking legitimate question. need mask I'm isolated myself, since aerosol droplets travel? People town drive around gigantic flags flying trucks. That's said good point haha. toss Fauci lying medical workers, many medical workers lying patients.

Not sure option better honest. almost like gerrymandering, voting access, systemic racism depress turnout. knew? Unfortunately, incredibly difficult many people vote here.

obviously deaths always awful, really show well country terms supressing virus Lmao sweetie say deaths 300% peak? Build wall! really highlights unhealthy sick US psyche political system metastudy hand. lots studies this.

Let‚Äôs fair plenty women also like this. deleted Facebook years ago, teachers work tell parents flipping mask requirements, demanding full ""back normal."" wear shield mask times eat Clif Bar car. might take Immodium pee limit restroom breaks too. We‚Äôre going see additional peaks globally due America‚Äôs response this. There‚Äôs way many countries keep borders closed USA long time. point, nations take risks allow free passage travelling Americans consequences it. Also face busybodies. another passenger flew Texas suggested COVID-19 situation argued: ""I personally know anyone know anyone knows anybody cases read mild - they're younger people now, hospitalisations understand we're getting herd immunity, virus maybe mutating perhaps less virulent form.""

Good you! thing: people different me, unpleasant point organizing whole life around wear little possible. obviously comply regulations live pandemix (despite reasonable doubt effectiveness measure) absolute hell me. really hope people thing ""people gross"" going abuse pandemic push dreams everyone wearing masks forever. imagine virus pleading break, much work That's 1% State population growing. 

Good news is, leaves 60-70 times people need get reach herd immunity! seems growing idea I‚Äôm seeing teachers don‚Äôt want go back they‚Äôre ‚Äúlazy‚Äù

I bet overlap anti-mask, anti-vax, ‚Äúnervous teachers lazy‚Äù groups near 100%. anti-intellectual zealots pox society. One medical people county council meeting area tried explain evolution tests, cases, positives council politicians clearly bonging beers Squee Tobin math class. horribly painful. like, well, fewer tests limit them, percent positive high. test more, percent naturally go down. cases spread people community positive, long you‚Äôre testing limiting, are, percent positive going again.‚Äù council like, ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre agreeing testing more.‚Äù she‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúWell, yes. point testing percent tests coming back positive higher, what‚Äôs alarming.‚Äù another council member like, ‚ÄúBut testing more?‚Äù Like trying confuse them. 

They also harped death rate similarly. tried explain death rate lags, treatments changed, outcomes death.

It exhausting. like thought medical person trying fool spin narrative. Oh okay, makes sense.

Nobody thinks America great job, nobody thinks China great job, great job.

That *only* exposure had. timing spot on. Recently, fomites found lesser sources infection previously thought. get infected yourself, infected person would cough, sneeze, spit something, droplet would enough live virus infectious, you‚Äôd touch it, touch eyes, inside nose, mouth. would enough live virus establish infection body.

When get takeout, put new container throw came in. takes away possibility fomite transmission part.

When eat, swallow live virus, stomach acid kill it. virus can‚Äôt survive digestive tract far know. Cooking food also kills virus.

I guess theory could something like salad large, infectious respiratory droplet food. could maybe inhale droplet bring food mouth, getting respiratory tract choking process. Maybe low risk transmission, merely speculation.

The biggest risk people around pick up, length time linger waiting food crowd, whether others around masked. Serious, fast, extensive contact tracing one keys eradicating virus state - particularly get number new cases per day tractable level. I'd hoped states would recruiting tracers ensure job properly, without screwed.

Given NY 426,807 cases, prevented 4000, scale needed, running process works.

Thank you! im luckily healthy 27 year old, dont fear dying. biggeat fear passed family. went parents house fourth july weekend. parents brother. tested negative though, know takes time show up. feel incredibly guilty. lmao fucking irony wearing KAG mask ü§£ stupid tho Drumph hated Quarantine! whole Quarantine reason!
Now, please ask why. one quite knows the
reason.

It could head screwed right.
It could be, perhaps, tie tight.

But think likely reason all,
May mask two sizes small. Yup, one's get infected bring back local communities. Seems like recipe disaster many people spending week parks. enough incubation time start asymptomatically spreading flight home. Looks like u/amybjp right man, we're gods fans, stop believing, fans anymore.

That's global warming really happening. enough fans. satan's plan along. somebody freeze till vaccine here? looks good North Pacific area Scientists say widespread testing needed get outbreaks new coronavirus control. many regions, there‚Äôs shortage chemicals needed run tests. several countries, health officials started using strategy first proposed Second World War: group testing. testing samples many people once, method save time, chemical reagents money, say India, Germany United States already using group testing.
There many ways conduct group testing, scientists several countries experimenting best method pandemic. ideas largely come field mathematics known group testing, widely used ‚Äî detecting faulty Christmas-tree lights estimating prevalence HIV population. Apparently dance, show time grocery shop without masks on. Trump would never this. He's re-opening pretending everything fine. would go messaging he's trying push Winning fucking hard Sorry that‚Äôs clearly directed you. REALLY never heard someone say general ‚Äúyou‚Äôre idiot if..‚Äù something? It‚Äôs general pointed you.

Man you‚Äôre quite sensitive government skewing hiding numbers all, irresponsible. Americans right know truth. probably wear seatbelts afraid extra ticket get pulled over... Yeah like he/she expect? Cooling centers necessary. I'm sure NY rapid spread March, fact expected Florida blow late March April. 

In May scratching head Florida done well comparison NY. Like many, hoped worst behind us still uneasy. going out, traveling nonsense. numbers seemed promising late May Florida.

Florida's spike tied directly rapid reopening tourism bars, different NY. like final death case numbers, going years data remotely reliable, ever be. Anecdotes, especially single person, aren‚Äôt data. 100% certain Stephen Miller wrote it. 3rd year university semester. much would love class face face, reality right now. would rather inconvenienced hospitalized. Deborah Birx heralded hero caving politics actual page time stamps. posted summary. Basically, two anecdotes patients reinfected sicker second time. doctors mentioned cases symptoms second time haven‚Äôt tested patients. thinks need studies. He‚Äôs worried immunity first infection vaccines. Really? mean true antibodies test. make sites (blood antibodies nose poke actual corona symptoms) take full 7 days 2nd part antibodies got waiting line. like beginning phases this, saying ""2 weeks"" palatable create much fear, outrage hoarding. trickling information sales job people resistant it.

I say shut least month. real time. crazy, 40 upvotes post minutes ago, 0. strange. Went 40 0 almost instantly. Every day Trump wakes ask 

What make even worse headline mention data, still accurate, chat proof it.

You say things headlines subreddit, especially come Sweden: state opinion show partial data support it, without giving complete overview. thought older forms estrogen risk DVT bought lip reading mask clear panel. wear mask anytime I‚Äôm building moving place place well. Southern folks don‚Äôt come here. eat alive. county reported 50 new cases Friday kind perfectly timed everything started reopening around month ago. 

Not saying haven‚Äôt great work, don‚Äôt let guard down. ""He also necessarily, admits that, whole national interest mind. looks narrow public health point view.""

In words: Muh economy. Muh Dow Jones.  What's frightening second shutdown. lot people going get sick die. look 9 days jacksonville (negative luckily) So... asymptomatic transmission rare? Last heard rare, ""pre symptomatic"" transmission common second one ranks eating outside 4 still admits it‚Äôs possible spread contract virus so. also doesn‚Äôt mention specifics wearing mask staying 6 feet away like experts suggest regular routines. 560* medical personnel. 

And 560 people population 28 million ABYSMAL. 

Youre acting military sending 5-7,000 people help us. dont know shit theyre even situation here. sit say

‚ÄúWell nurses say different‚Äù

While citing single houston source contradicting presidents Houston‚Äôs 4 major hospitals saying.

So someone lying- either presidents boards Houston‚Äôs 4 major hospitals, random redditor. opposite, Japan pays tons money US military presence. believe many voting general, 2016 voters election percentage eligible voters still one highest turnouts since 60‚Äôs. genuinely don‚Äôt understand you‚Äôre trying say. Yep. Cousin florida, got tested whiiile back still hasn‚Äôt heard results. I‚Äôm one them, le sigh would argue ckose ties China, conflict interest, that's all... Disneyworld opened yet??? ""Transgender broken arm syndrome""

Your arm's broken? probably hormones.

Spiro makes pee, estradiol makes grow boobs. Neither cause drop dead COVID symptoms. seems totally random. wanted italics get show up.   Terrifying. Loves Unfortunate truth. I'm going grandmother's funeral, refuse risk SO's grandparents' lives flying back home back. shit simply dangerous right now. ‚Äúour system‚Äù, employer. test company wouldn‚Äôt let return negative. Business blog praises business businessing. Lol countries those? Literally warded draconian measures combined efficiency. draconian measures still suck like president nothing actually rallies . tweet. actual news? problem kid getting covid 

It's kid getting 10million kids time misc knocks 10k kids need hospitalization hospitals collapse weak symptom kid getting help   Yeah, I‚Äôm looking regional teaching FB page bc saw posted there. Hang on.   Lol. Active r/conspiracy New Years wish end unbelievable stupidity, greed, selfishness Americans.

I know it‚Äôs ludicrous feel terrible responsible way die. people won‚Äôt educate themselves, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúDarwin awards.‚Äù didn‚Äôt wish virus existence, wishes aren‚Äôt real, it‚Äôs wanted. monkey‚Äôs paw. Yeah Exactly. Dr. Fauci right mortality rate *the important* indicator. Wipes next impossible find, general cleaners bottles available seems though Likely outcome one get reinfected going mild.

If case, herd immunity protect skip vaccinantion. Similarly there's vaccination almost everybody going infected eventually. NBA chose location becuase one places suitable house quarantine/tournament entire NBA, Florida supposed safe. 

If everything goes plan players take things seriously leave park go mess around among surrounding population, probably able go without major issues. Whether players actually another story.  Name website checks out. Americans accepted idea lockdown ""we month problem goes away."" reality, emergency measure avert catastrophic hospital overcrowding.

When problem failed go away, lot people decided much trouble. Huge swaths country want acknowledge virus 4-6 week fix. I'm yelling asking person joking say something 100% knew going happen happening. questioning know lot terribly run studies say one worthless? Hey skank, Schools need stinkin' federal funds. funded local level.

God fast vote retreads. geek

The thing mainstream original star wars trilogy, like, milk. got hit first it‚Äôs pretty much would thought would say Naples Florida. Money money money Well, strain went Italy/Spain/UK deadly there. may less deadly strain Wuhan, say, that's still unclear. appreciate info, helpful! dope ass day! would dead.  everything doesn‚Äôt need fight doing? exactly told good no? documented cases someone infected beyond six feet outdoors? reads like movie villain's evil plan. reaping sowed back 2016 2018. That's awful . think Florida think Florida Karen screaming trader Joe's. Florida people stay home wear mask üò∑. That‚Äôs record number whole country And, course, irony economy tank *anyway*. Even officially ‚Äúopened‚Äù. 

When enough people getting sick/dying, people simply go less less. Folks want die live rest lives damaged lung. Funny works. 

Look Sweden. economy suffered much neighbors. difference lots dead people. internet hoax circulated early June Antifa agitators heading rural white counties, Plumas Bank boarded windows business owners lined Main Street baseball bats.When local teenagers stood front Niles Hotel waving homemade, hard-to-read signs, Gates trading post put bat, crossed street lent thick black Sharpie. Oh, definitely agree everyone here, meant everyone's brainwaves directed thing time might give us boost! ""Hey guys, look, 7 day moving average positivity increased 15.5 close 20%, look one day lower, clearly everything stabilized. Nothing see here."" upvote. 
I'm pretty sure downvoted speaking hard, uncomfortable truth. 


If Fed goes nationwide school reopenings, matter ""if"" we'll see schoolchildren dying COVID ""how many"". Harder? Try impossible. get mad saw /s wow keep getting better better.

but im edgelord. Everyone get it. Everyone rich, followed everyone politics, followed everyone plays sport. live Orlando - confirm fucked. faster get it, faster us over.. fuck it. Pre-Covid = Job.  
Post-Covid = Job.  

Yeah covid took something away, job. push whatever liberals want. It‚Äôs irrelevant is. It‚Äôs emotional gut response like Pavlov‚Äôs dog. think capacity still. I'm suspecting sort backlog here. Honestly 15k cases per day Florida alone leave house. There's high risk catching it. I'm starting meet friends things UK we're posting average 579 cases day (and btw worst Europe). ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Saved click. Yep prostitution seen something forced upon young women. would ship Filipina‚Äôs clubs guys would like ‚Äúthey sluts whores etc etc etc‚Äù.
No, young girls 18-30 either forced financial coercion sleep many guys possible. must say, working STD clinic made much easier avoid places. Barcelona hundreds new infections daily, perfectly safe tourists come. wish competent governments like HK Europe. Appreciate link :)

Yeah think started picking National Geographic published translation Gospel Judas Codex Tchacos back 2006. read parts magazine thinking respect canon, cool supplement piece. Exactly. literally would have. heard plenty anti-condom HIV propaganda Christian groups. Okay, scientifically, much spread associated asymptomatic people? Well, guess good news math, every single person world infected within 17 days, us survive pretty normal winter. Wow guess concept preventive healthcare means nothing ü•¥ Remember, COVID started people. Outbreaks always possible even cases going down... California horrible representation. really think California needs broken up. **Asymptomatic presymptomatic people transmit COVID-19 infections: Study** 

no shit? tried leaving house cant roll bed? 


in news Water Wet.  irony (not sure irony sounds good), Americans tax dollars go towards Healthcare developed nations worse health outcomes. universal healthcare US, US tax decrease quality care increase. article high quality, fact based information .. said 1 percent currently 1% entire population america tested positive coronavirus shit ton. assume 100% america's population wearing mask, means 99% mask wearers CONTRIBUTING spread. hell point fining somebody $750 wearing mask? guilty spreading virus? Also make reddit account purely bash people r/coronavirus? IMO likeliest outcome reinfection extremely rare mild occur flu herd immunity. since Bush Jr.  absolutely incorrect irresponsible claim covid causes ‚Äúpermanent organ damage‚Äù. Please spread misinformation. Please stick scientific sources order confuse false information sub. Wow Dan, could President! Someone tell poor people getting evicted move. You‚Äôre ignoramus. Teacher lupus here- currently seeking employment. 
Even it‚Äôs me, astronomically climbing infection rate state: one students, coworkers, support staff likely die district- statically. 

Even it‚Äôs one- that‚Äôs one many.

I work low income district many students raised grandparents blended families- could take home lose caretakers. 

There also WHOLE list logistical issues schools open one answering us. worth noting testing kits improved since April. access many testing kits time. NY lazy.

That still change data. I'm reading correctly, \~50% symptomatic people? suppose cases can't avoid interacting others (family, acquiring vital supplies, hospitals) cases preventable things presenting symptoms (going work, going bar, going non-vital shopping) ? Thank time ! Side note influenza mutates rather quickly compared coronaviruses general. Modoc little slice Idaho - CDC updated page. 0.65% infection fatality ratio new best estimate.  Laughs Canadian US worst response this... minorities.

More like ignorant vs educated. phenomenal news. I'm definitely worried importing cases, feels like we've earned temporary cautious sigh relief. Day 7 here, results sight. turn around time depends type test lab going to. Identical California. Well, time. I'm honestly surprised took long. class people meetings via shady VoIP services safety home decide best way shove poor people's children overcrowded schools fast possible... malignance. malice, pure simple. sees declining polls, rather spurring take action, thinks ""maybe deserve live hate much."" Sounds like labs backed least deaths happened last week confirmed COVID. realize UK behind Belgium total deaths 660 per million.

About two weeks ago seems masks recommended Sweden. They're 547 deaths per million, soon surpass Italy's 578.

Not Europe, Mexico number South American countries skyrocketing. Chile Peru 350+ deaths per million Ecuador Mexico hitting 250+. I‚Äôm surprised. administration looking scapegoat. tried using China Trump‚Äôs polling Covid still bad. reeks jealousy desperation. People believe 99% fine. 1% must comorbidities, fault. life must go risk worth it. 

My simple argument this. Would take free flight 200 passengers plane every flights 2 people died asphyxiation, 4 people needed breathing tubes 6 people kind organ failure. 8 people lasting neurological problems. 
- Immediate answer way hell! go crowded bar drink... depressing!!! Texas. gotta minimum increments want get anywhere. Yea they're sharing ac units apartment complexes, they're spreading non darwin award recipients Reads like troll r/nyc tbh tired winning yet? Governments world:

PLEASE SAVE US AMERICA!

Please perform ‚Äúhumanitarian intervention‚Äù leaders kill us all. \\*

You put slash front it. case, two slashes could see first slash. Yeah, I'm actually kind torn this.

On one hand, love online teaching, I'm good it, could definitely redesign courses make better fit online. want that, take pride work want prove skeptical students online classes actually good.

On hand, get paid one-and-a-half students' worth tuition teaching 23-student class, getting paid extra redesign course, going lot work.

I think end I'm going wind caring students getting fairly compensated hard work, kind stupid thinking wound job first place. Depends, essential work like care, school, NHS food work, otherwise work home ever possible. they've extended furlough scheme government pays 80% wages employer whether pay remaining 20%. I‚Äôm even going try guess you‚Äôre lol, could near across country. don‚Äôt entirely disagree you‚Äôre saying, think depends people mean saying ‚Äúthey‚Äù. It‚Äôs accurate say Americans deal longer should. It‚Äôs accurate say ‚Äúthey won‚Äôt put masks on‚Äù ‚Äúthey won‚Äôt need to.‚Äù BS point IMHO. spaces hospital people require hospital treatment. city one-in-five people virus, elder care facility could safely operate prepared handle virus. imagine patients sent back initially infected home facilities. place said could safely care covid patient told patients would placed elsewhere DoH, going let ride 2 extra weeks taking hospital bed.

Zero deaths tied decision state disproportionate number deaths elder care facilities portion total deaths. 

This pretty transparently attempt 'gotcha' cuomo, opposed anything substance.

If disagreed policy, think covid+ residents elder care taken hospital, b/c afaik world that.

edit: NY actually *lowest* state terms % deaths associated nursing homes. 20% covid-related deaths NY linked long-term care facilities, versus national average 42%  Obviously great comparison many reasons, certainly shows NY significant problem terms overall situation nursing home residents (albeit context one worst public health crises modern need demographic covid infection data draw reasonable conclusions, nobody does. young people getting infected (parties, beaches, giving fuck etc) less likely die. several cases plague found every year many countries, even USA; China mostly marmots, USA prarie dogs squirrels spreading it. nothing uncommon new. ‚Äúthem‚Äù liberal states pumped number death create fear factor. 

3 states 40% deaths don‚Äôt add up. going get point entire world let us travel deserve it. got confused current one

\#peetapes Trump wanted make political issue.

If fucking balls whatsoever, he‚Äôd criminal trial *very* serious consequences (the kind feet don‚Äôt touch ground) end fucking shit. Motherfuckers. Bet gotta pay foam board pocket too. Canada quarantine symptoms. I've couple tests results came back 2-3 days, quarantine needed waiting. (I need get tested visit retirement home). Apparently new rapid test approved distribution results 90 mins (I think). one point early Florida segmenting people state data. sure changed accuracy anything officials.  It‚Äôs logical theories Americans understand moderation. opened couple things fucking everybody flooded places.  also notions ""i know anybody it"" ""i think could get "" prevalent. 

leadership also questionable. America‚Äôs biggest mistake treating COVID deaths statistics numbers rather sons, daughters, parents, friends. People love parroting oh 10% people get COVID die, 10% child parent suddenly isn‚Äôt statistic anymore 4/9 low moderate risk. relatively safe among social activities scheme things cause second wave. safe isolation? No, even isolation home risk.

Also, specific outdoor dining? can't expected people wear masks eating, I'm sure experts considered making chart. Mods awful get used need keep eye many deaths. saw 45 people died yesterday, Florida. Covid dash 95 years old Bigots care science vs people perfect try best better care science. feel snowball. People got mortgages apartments rent carrying costs need pay pocket. can't find renters pay need break even start putting market. market gets flooded multi-unit buildings, demand rentals, sit price lowers. Carrying costs continue buildings go foreclosure.

Is possible verge another financial melt-down? probably biggest takeaway, too. live south FL, close enough. heartbreaking know Miami-Dade Broward original FL hotspots going back months, still allowed numbers keep rising big way. I'm hoping miracles point.  Dowdy, Tex Dowdy. Literally would care career? career behind him!

But care country call President horrible job! Phobia unreasonable fear. It‚Äôs fucking phobia hundreds reasons fear covid. Reasonable fear healthy. fearless pandemic stupid unhealthy. wish perspective aimed protests, thousands masks many without three weeks major cities, way people congregating Disney. protests equivalent like 30+ Disneys opened time fuck knows

At rate America going might know first! going run restraunts, bars, entertainment establishments everyone masters stem field, wants 100k+ jobs???????? mean virus magically go away keep ignoring pretending exist? Damnit! typically. often life long administrators. Texas fine military wouldn‚Äôt deploying 580 doctors nurses there. Wait til southern folks live come city! people refuse wear masks! want vacation everywhere it‚Äôs disgusting! it‚Äôs not. lower risk vacations people do. don‚Äôt need rude. According Republicans, economic issues cause suicides, Americans pussies.

People death camps fight live, starving people, tortured people. Lepers, people broken bodies, victims every horror, struggle.

But Americans, kill can't go shopping. We're fucking embarrassment. yeah that's true fine, almost never see put way, always absolute statement Trump mention stuff. Oh good medical expert Donald Trump issues efficacy masks. Hopefully told every country control thanks part mask wearing. Devos never wanted fund public schools even pandemic. cares private charter schools. favor vouchers well. would take us back time many horrible ways. Ron DeathSentence HOW?! least fast tracking new results? Russia also well. know Earth flat though, right? best friend got tested three weeks ago still heard nothing. Tampa anyone‚Äôs curious. Right. Disney attracts people EVERYWHERE. locals. diverse demographic bring virus, also take back home towns. know people hurting money, leisure travel especially theme park, seems like really bad idea. dIsNeY wOrLd DoOm Us AlL! No, thankfully! Still quite ill tho Actually read european press, US intelligence tried warn Trump january situation china, could get him.

So course blame. Btw. clearly gave warnings early february countries something contain still time left, mostly ignored except souteastern asia already high alert thanks Sars years before. Florida like 4 months avoid this.

bUt tRumP sAiD fLu. Thank expressing concern mine.

I also agree frustrated horrified deliberately flaunt willful ignorance. They're risking themselves, they're risking family well.

And agree, fact someone die change minds terrible, terrible thing happen.

I'm going withhold compassion, though, they're grieving, horrified decisions. realize they've put hundreds, maybe even thousands risk, due ignorance, absolutely outrages me. taken loved one dying happen, though.

Again, they've lost someone significant community family. can't even imagine guilt, horror, grief they're going through.

There's atonement enough actions. they've lost someone, compassion give allow spread message culpability, deal grief private. 

They deserve monstrous behavior us, deserve pity. believed people inherent reason lie you, perhaps problem runs deeper CEOs full shit. point view vet lots friends brother still in, fuck attitude never stopped research, moratorium grants forced review process make sure scientists making infectious versions SARS MERS.

Eminem still lyrical genius. we‚Äôve known years.  much hate say will, go everyone acting like it‚Äôs it‚Äôs done gone. People overcrowding without mask outside outdoor dining areas , front bars, people attending parties disregarding social distancing rules. I‚Äôve seen 90% people wear mask 20% wearing mask. Literally hotel starting throwing rooftop parties disregard social distancing rules masks. thing offered rapid test shown accurate. manager asked said ‚Äú never guaranteed anyone 100% accurate , here‚Äù second wave, people acting like disappeared thin air won‚Äôt make return. worry, testing we're /s played chicken life lost. many innocent people losing lives due circumstances avoid worry ""covid party"" attendees. snapshot what's actually happening. real numbers always higher. Timeeeee side.....yes - Death probably. Could that, sudden jump like due something reporting process. Florida set record today. 15000 positive cases day. Weird Mexico's outbreak started US outbreak, almost US spread Mexico, nahhhhh. Dem taaaayco eat'n megicans raaaapists, mardeahurs, cootie infyested. death rate hit full swing yet. Mark words starting Tuesday deaths FL 100 200 per day. week likely higher. agree, forced retire April 27 years....I lucky able to. Rape murder. much rape murder impunity. Trump's insane. There's incivil political post... pathetic. No, shouldn't. He's scientific figure public trusts ever-thinning herd opportunistic elites. He's interested political theater, that's people like him. Happy NHL chose Canada getting shot 15000 single day? 
Meanwhile country sitting 2800 total infected research people asymptomatic? know makes people risk, common trends people barely notice it? old people states like FL AZ would flock northeast cause outbreaks there. They're already flowing back. I'm seeing way Florida plates NY usual. There's definitely subset selfish people encouraging interstate spread like this. resented people metastasized FL, resent return. must learned word today Unreal downvoted. Must Chinese communists here. Oh hurts :( Texas one southern state. others. Plural. limited state mask usage mandates. Thing is, mix symptoms easily common cold, situation march.. symptoms, turned cold, 10 days hard quarantine took 5 days get test result 5 days get tested!

I remote worker anyway house garden, affect mildly others become quite uneasy situation. Exactly. long Disney World still open...... Usa sucks. 

Good luck getting tested ohio thought mile sounds like long queue see they're queueing cars! However, guess that's effective way staying 2m apart. Trump sacrificial lamb, one many Clearly sarcastic magic part (unless...IS germs go away? get magicked void?) flu like quotes dipshits know made comparison. nice thing Russia even deal parking nukes Cuba time.  federated system de facto allows give counties decision reopen. Remember Cali large, heterogenous behemoth state, unfortunately politics money gets way many people bitching. Trying keep everyone happy federal support. 99k test last 24 hours surprised this. Mother god, *India* using whole scale?! maths nerds, computer people, budget shortage. need pull methods can.

God help us....the solution problems right there, nobody highest echelons competent order it. think make links. listen whole thing haven‚Äôt looked.  care deaths fellow countrymen? might sociopath! could me, still looks like employee wearing gloves. cant even get propaganda video right, doubts safely practices Every time make case say Newsom could done better job, get downvoted. true NY.

So getting bad NYC definitely tolerated goal many redditers. wondering Florida, Texas, Arizona proactive, lot people think New York success story enjoy hearing otherwise. like 30%? cut half least good news I'd curious know average 'duration stay' hospitals. 'discharge' rates compare say 3 months ago. here? Go back r/nyc Lol, checkout shit Round Rock Cue Greg ""Localized Government Best Unless Blue"" Abbott:

FWIW, many commanders left leaning shelter home orders much possible, negating typical right leaning mindset. Obviously essential jobs can‚Äôt shelter home many operations don‚Äôt stop, might see infections that.. suspect many right leaners taking seriously going work anyways symptoms. 

All say military taking pretty seriously, based experience past months. Obviously YMMV.. assume moment that, average - people likely contact around 3-4 people getting tested. gets bad quickly continually left unchecked Trumpy parts CA always find reason try recall Newsom, Covid they'd dream reason. Let waste time, like Dem dominated electorate going recall him. get bored recall process, they'll go back circle jerking thinking one day secede CA become 'The Great State Jefferson' lol.

We're boned Yeah that‚Äôs exactly trying get at. Guy thinks taking things slow help ADHD students fact it‚Äôll even harder even find motivation ‚Äúgo class‚Äù. Best luck semester.

Edit: it‚Äôs also reason students *do college*. easy watching lectures one‚Äôs time, would blazing coursera online boot camps. Maybe parts Cali, certainly all... Florida learned CCP. dunno recall late January redditor noticed CCP's death data matched 2 3 parameter equation R^2 = 0.9998. impossible data close match simple equation.  early judge Florida's medical services? 

If one month cases reach level NY number death still lower one NY...wouldn't mean Florida better job NY? Considering disease lasts person 2-4 weeks, see 2 million people could catch course 60-70 days million people infected height epidemic? Keep mind, flat rate infection start finish. Look deaths NYC using 7 day average: 

1. March 20th - 15

2. March 30th - 265

3. April 9th - 867

It flat lines +900 15th drop 800 19th. April 30th dropped 417.

The first week april pretty easy imagine million people infected. 10 days 800-1000 people dying every day. NY yesterday: 0.87 deaths per million; 40.7 new cases per million

FL yesterday: 4.42 deaths per million; 482.3 new cases per million

At least NYC, can't eat restaurant. takes middle fucking nowhere reason people go town. selfishness america really astonishing, second china. think DC extra influence virtue capitol city. course could wrong, may one reason consider neutral ground.  percent kids develop this. Around 1 1000? America: *first time?* 2K phony ass shit. artifact testing backlog/saturation actual numbers. 

If capacity would tipping 10K day, easy.  live Louisiana backlash shocking. Facebook I'm seeing people compare John Bel Edwards Hitler alluding beginning steps FEMA concentration camps. nerve compare wearing masks grocery store Holocaust. never said wanted anyone catch virus saw this...no one office wear them. boss sending department wide emails scam get Trump office. surreal. math include potential strain 7/4 spike infections, people dying quicker frequently.

It also means 15k/1500/150 numbers could seem low then. Yeah 77,000 jobs blah blah blah aka 77,000 people intermingling ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù way bigger risk Bc 77,000 essentially forced risk getting sick Bc employer decided open even though virus numbers multiplying every day. 

If one hypothetically infects one person day, that‚Äôs 144,000 288,000 576,000 2-3 days ?

Surprising, considering people flights go immigration many countries easily. June 7 entire USA 18,933 new cases. month days Florida 15,300 new cases. 

With DeSantis willing bare minimum basically performing giant unsanctioned experiment populace FL. finally get see bad things get Covid left unchecked responsibility stopping virus left entirely individuals. Florida clocking 15.5k cases 45 deaths. Arizona claims 2.5k cases 89 deaths. Obviously something isn‚Äôt adding up. says thinks Americans wearing masks show disapprove preventive measure pandemic classic case don‚Äôt give fuck people drag rest us them. Fearless Leader doesn‚Äôt help. Right changed nothing except costing jobs. sound REALLY privileged. going feel landlords go under? fault too? you‚Äôre saying 15,000 insignificant number? whack-job Tokyo 4 days 200 new cases per day already freaking out. Florida opens disney 15k cases. weight absolutely nothing it, nothing whatsoever anyone that's going come around fat shame, would advise didnt I'm going tell you. ""As July 12, total 65,592 **(+1,378)** cases reported Ohio since pandemic began, leading 3,058 **(+22)** deaths 8,842 **(+72)** hospitalizations. presumed recovered 44,663(+562) cases Ohio.""  Woohoo! country FUCKING SUCKS! (along millions others) live physical Hell. Read article smh Meanwhile Federal Government still washes hands anything. point, EU countries cases per capita US. 3 European countries cases per capita: San Marino, Vatican City, Andorra. (They microstates.) 

As far deaths per capita, 8 European countries deaths US, including France, Spain, Italy UK. US climbing rankings quickly. Started vaccine ready fall. Evolved ready end year. ready early *next* year. half way next year... good news. Indiana, I've told 10 business days now. got swabbed, said 2-4 days. changed 5-7 days 10 biz days. Complete utter shitshow! tested July 1st still waiting. bullshit Trump‚Äôs fans fed led believe? We‚Äôre fucked. It‚Äôs ‚Äúover‚Äù, it‚Äôs handled well. vast majority population infected. goes show smart regulations people behaving society whole mind things get lot closer normal without people dying. previous administration stopped research weaponizing Obama administration concerned research could make viruses dangerous, wanted stop review studies see could make germs capable causing disease spreading easily air.

Apparently, Chinese stop similar research. believe China's number neither, believe actions. watching CNN day, saw [how people live Politics aside, action like can't contain virus, know can. American Exceptionalism roofied punch props Individualism. It‚Äôs much hocus pocus. It‚Äôs getting harder see light here. Yup. Next step figure active virus. Lab culture. PCR remnants, little cause concern.

Seriously, there's process already. keep dance again. need determine relapse vs reinfection. even actually relapse either, since symptoms. might intercountry travel EU countries countries, people still work country, even border areas. US think many people even consider state job in, long close enough home. State laws effect, less needing speak entirely different language different country laws. I've never since mononucleosis. never desire midday nap recovered it. mean? Ever since January 22nd ""We totally control"" [Trump wanna put people corny star wars quote. 20 feet job closer mask required. Tennessee? They're obviously fudging death numbers  crowns Disney Coronavirus shaped like mouse ears! Sorry mis-remembered. welcome. Yeah, I'd say similar feeling that. feels like skin burned super sensitive. try follow virologists/epidemiologists. 

There's point arguing sub. 

Although funny enough, swedish study feeds clogged people commenting ""BUT TCELLS"" 

Science going thing, best bet continue social distancing masking figure out. want hospitals places like Houston Miami overloaded airbus Covid patients across country NJ? 

What heck suppose do? definitely canceled. hear even bands coming. Rumor kid rock idk thats true though. important point! would love see Lincoln project folks actually create advertisement. alternate universe scenario stated inoculate people real right-wing BS. 12 (or more?) countries recorded first cases us functionally zero community spread. Don‚Äôt give bullshit big America is, takes courage sacrifice beat thing, leaders pushing people hit Disney World.

Yep. like cause effect. states truly experiencing worst leadership American history. rhetoric telling. don‚Äôt don‚Äôt want live fear want others live fear. live reality don‚Äôt want catch virus. Wearing mask public big deal. It‚Äôs sensible effective way slow spread. Denialists aren‚Äôt challenging shit, they‚Äôre selfish ignorant. anything, pandemic hyped here. Except NDTV. NDTV unbiased? Everyone biased. doesn‚Äôt mean lying numbers. 

All state government numbers also out. Unless suggesting every single political party media lying take word it. 

It‚Äôs much likely reporting know don‚Äôt know much. 

No one throwing journalists out. Don‚Äôt make wild accusations India isn‚Äôt bad want be. Thank correction  worth Israel hard lockdown like Doomers sub root every day result basically shit. Look, end day dining OUTSIDE equivalent dining INSIDE regardless idea is. think didnt see spike tens thousands protestors gathered outside? Apart fairly widespread mask usage, main reason OUTSIDE. massive difference dynamics spread outdoors stop fear mongering embarrassing. wish country apologetic actions right now. Genocide eugenics. There's solutions outside schools implemented food. Maybe pandemic learn adapt situation we're given instead sitting around. Money tight lot people yes children need taken care time done without schools. saying things easy parents unable go work kids home bs excuse cause odds are, schools gonna spread virus rapidly kids, kids spread people live with, leaving even people unable go work filling even hospital beds

There nice paper, people gonna uncomfortable pushed near limits likely that's world handed us survive get mess even faster. everyone works together world get cause that's humans StrongHandDan = Uneducated Mouth-Breathing Troglodyte Drug tests show current intoxication levels. Whatever person may outside work personal time.

Workers Safeway California , cannabis legal still drug tested (including cannabis) 

This often leads people continue drink social acceptability despite much dangerous is. 

Having drugs piss test doesn‚Äôt mean using drugs work, therefore employers business(unless accident likely , , happen alcohol)

This isn‚Äôt really safety, it‚Äôs continuing fraudulent status quo war drugs. Oh shit! didn‚Äôt see anything like that, could get source g?  It‚Äôs scam. friends cousin nurse Atlanta knows nurse Florida said hospitals full getting paid mark people coronavirus infections. removing freedoms money. /s There's secret hit yet. People shouldn‚Äôt shitting Brazilians either. Mocking folks there‚Äôs mass death going ghoulish. 1. Bolton reports tried something‚Äù That's evidence? ...only 13 percent study group free COVID-19 symptoms. contrast, bit half still least three symptoms typical disease.... common symptom fatigue, followed difficulty breathing, joint pain, chest pain. 10 percent still coughing, similar numbers seen sense smell return. large range symptoms also present.

This Italian study 143 covid patients hospitalized ave 13 days tested negative upon release. I'm going go ahead guess policy made leader state country employer. think important accurately place blame. 

For example: work USA employer's policy almost stupid. come contact someone sick tested, would required come mandatory 3 office days week person came contact positive test. last person heard getting tested (Chicagoland area, Illinois) took 5 7 days get results. (There's quick test faster lot less accurate) would go work knowing came contact someone fever. Since 95% cases fever/ symptoms within 5 days, time realized person I've come contact coronavirus symptoms ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è potentially come contact many people work. still get it! I'm going walking around school classrooms...  like company's upper management berates employees increase productivity, instead leave unmotivated, burnt out, jaded. Good leaders provide environment encourages employees work hard. leaders providing environment. ‚Äújumped animal human‚Äù opposed to.. exactly? Don‚Äôt think anyone arguing this- discussion spillover occurred conditions. Yep. It‚Äôs matter time massive economic downturn. economy depends upon people bottom spending money, dependent upon money spend. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm really bored? I‚Äôm one people willing stay home, mental health.‚Äù I've heard would love source article it/ time share it. fucking virus.... guy didn‚Äôt serve obvi go. 

so places 10m inhabitants colleges then?

EDIT : also, US 400m people even round number. 330m people. round number up, get 350m 300m people; nice going pulling 70m people ass. Lmao proven people get infected again? Anybody presenting CT blood results look like COVID pandemic states right COVID. winter anymore. Yes things cause clinical hematological syndrome, they're zebras giraffes, covid is, relatively speaking, roaches ants. nasal swab without doubt much less accurate severe advanced disease clinical diagnosis point. reason require test hide true numbers ""go rules,"" US institutions protect themselves, good patients public. come thread curious HRT effects immune system. immunocompromised ton meds wondered relevant side effects putting trans people higher risk? Someone said blood clots, makes sense.


Obviously manager douche making shit blame anyone themselves, anyone want tell (who spewing transphobic bullshit pretending truth) HRT make likely contract covid-19, article read? better clarification üëçüèª So, saw coming. One way another. Actually positive rate going Nearly 143,000 people tested Saturday Florida 11.25% results coming back positive coronavirus. That‚Äôs Florida‚Äôs lowest rate positive test results since end June people receive tests. Wednesday, percentage people tested positive virus much higher 18.35%. Ah yes, cited Dr. Fauci said, days ago, zero confirmed cases reinfections.

Oh wait, weren't, said zero. applies financial media tbh. obviously true considering incidents ""refugees"" Germany past years. Cool kit locked? get tested corona? test number reflected current number tests administered day prior.

The tests number reported since prior day, total tests administered day before. Admiral Brett Giroir: ""Dr. Fauci 100 percent right also necessarily, admits that, whole national interest mind. looks *very narrow public health point view*""

A point view supposed first priority government, protect citizens... smh grand prize. Point taken exactly point record, NJ deaths still staggeringly high we're going back deaths *March* properly identify COVID deaths. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre downvoted. 1000s tests day also burned special events like nba Orlando, people going flying require low exposure symptoms, etc. lot negative tests aren‚Äôt even people likely positive. gives rate testing much better look, actually obfuscates truth. Especially reports believed positive test results public taking 3-14 days report negative results 1000s VIP swabs coming back 6 hours. obviously skew data analysis look favorable lower positive #s. Real question is, many people referred tests actual doctors healthcare folks, popped folks need certified clean bill health travel/work/etc. surely never find desantis gone. confusing nobody everybody friend .. Never attribute to¬†malice adequately explained stupidity.

[Hanlon's sure you‚Äôre quoting, keep moving goalposts want, Texas still facing pending lockdown disease burden situation still bad enough you‚Äôre asking help DoD addition massive military medical footprint state already enjoys.

You‚Äôre angry, that‚Äôs fine, doesn‚Äôt change facts. Wonder date confirmation submitted confirmed/tested release results patients? it‚Äôs release, they‚Äôre 9-10 days behind. yes, evidently many unfortunately. Well then... sir exempt masks!!!!1111!! great time idiot boss whole family COVID deniers vacation Florida week. They're going bring back infect us work refuse wear masks.  Except LIED beginning masks. He's deep state. Fair point! undoubtedly played huge part; Disney chosen could keep players staff ""bubble"" Disney resorts basketball facilities. 

It's unfortunate best place keep NBA confined one place also happened Florida. subreddit rules say analysis banned ? reference, see [last weeks friends Waukesha County don‚Äôt give fuuuuuuck Florida's deaths starting increase. number going rise, unfortunately. care.

Your sarcasm legit trash like fail English tests. even read response? It‚Äôs also strange Florida oldest population country, believe, would expect Covid death rate higher states. world financial/monetary system &amp; economy fragile handle stress.

Treatment better &amp; deadly &amp; severe feared. 20-25% NYC got infected 2 months? See clearly places government took proven steps fight virus, nearly level problem. government inherently bad, bad government, especially current GOP, clearly is. literally came post watching friend's stories boat lol. Yeah. Would feel obnoxious north east states already put work genetics racial predjudice, think... Nah, fam. stuff two kids single bag. Think much money hospitals could save! would great shareholders! =D making people wear masks, least call ""Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween"" üéÉ  argument. keep saying stupid things. posted actual definition something tried failed define. quit imagining kids end internet, creep. 

You're one imagined 12 yr old. Stop called it. Simple. 98% places. 40-45 far low. Maybe areas, studies put average significantly higher. uh mask came seconds grocery. chances breathed someone‚Äôs covid cloud? paid so. Well schmoozing guy need flattery controls kinds supplies... pregnant nurse work chemo infusion flying family Florida vacation. Oh don‚Äôt worry! ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want much!‚Äù go beach.. üòí live (not US), sometimes tests would completed within hours. NY: 400K Cases, 32K Deaths.

Florida: 255K Cases, 4K Deaths.

Under standards Florida worse? I'm genuinely asking. death per million type statistic? 

From raw numbers Covid cases deaths alone, seems Florida better job? also know French friends blame everything Roma, too? Imagine kids getting dragged family vacation, though. Cansino supposed start phase III testing Canada Dalhousie back May. China ‚Äúcustoms‚Äù held shipment China. :( I'm suddenly seeing swathe comments sites like twitter raising doubt vaccine ever come about.

Based previous attempts vaccines illnesses, exactly odds this, especially considering succesful phases current efforts passed far? South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Germany, Canada, countries fine without sadistically literally locking millions people homes. Two ones mentioned, Germany Canada, might call lockdowns cruel it. I'm supporter lockdowns there's right way there's China did. there's US did. Sweden sub-10% immunity. cases per day decreased since March. 

Type ‚Äúsweden covid cases‚Äù google you‚Äôll see chart. Damn guys really good winning covid race.. flaired Good Propoganda mini-skirts calls Putin. Putin knows worst thing America guides trump making decision saying thing. Nah, completely compromised Personally, I've grown weary left's illusion maintaining ""moral high ground"". Time time Trump supporters avoided reason nuance every turn. voting enough cure disease anti-intellectualism plagued country. level stoop I'm tired waving finger them, begging finally come senses. Oxford already started production, way, running research production side side, evidence comes works, hit distribution immediately, evidence say work throw away. Last checked said tens millions ready dispatch October. British Prime Minister said healthcare workers first, elderly (assuming works well enough them), everyone else. NY 3 months prepare learn treat sick, they‚Äôd less deaths.

The reason FL less deaths thanks learned CA NY months ago. less Coviddy We‚Äôre good thankfully. follow guidelines best can. Wife busy setting online courses even district can‚Äôt provide clear guidelines. It‚Äôs mess since concerned funding lives. late adopt

Fauci doesn‚Äôt power authority ‚Äúadopt‚Äù anything. He‚Äôs pushed lot things administration slow getting behind recommending. It'll generation little sociopaths. fault, it'll still amount that. disney junkie feels poor taste. Well apart JSDF 9th highest budget world 4th powerful conventional military world.... Yeah, remember celebrity noting little president thought black community. Wonder happened him... confirm this. got tested July 6 still waiting. could take year college try find job. Mods... MODS ‚ÄúWe always war East Asia‚Äù Literally reminds Greed plays huge roll. lack foresight. tempted post r/conspiracy. again, pretty busy uncovering Wayfair.com's plot selling missing children via furniture ads. 

And no, forget /s, real theory. Opening paragraph wrong. Third cases/million residents third cases. even that‚Äôs little misleading. broke areas India, Brazil, etc smaller zones I‚Äôm sure areas worse SC too. SC definitely bad least try understand numbers reporting! went business times, y'all got cool music shop high risk excuse bullshit, healthy still get fucked this. Fake opposed staying lending veneer respectability Trump's shitshow? Nah. ""adults room"" argument always crap. Name *one single time* one adults actually made difference really mattered. Fauci effective agent current position, countering Trump's worst impulses advocating good policy, setting all-time records daily confirmed cases right now. He's stooge, ignored disrespected. Trump clearly give shit say, think fired him? he's good PR. that's *all* point. Wolf hasn‚Äôt gave thoughts fall sports yet bro Maybe! Nothing get even started getting better midway January. Trump president then, uniquely terrible system let's lose stay power almost 3 months.

It'll total mess likely even control Trump replaced. Plague rat! ever stood line? started bleak, New York one bright spots recently pandemic! Good Job New York! even close. Florida Texas ICUs collapsing forget also going back school. Fine business allow people without masks. shut down. Hey Florida. wear mask. bad health. Covid19 real. believe anything. fly. Try it. Jump nearest building. mean jump nearest building. Jumping buildings bad you. United States truly fucked. Holy fuck. job's coronavirus response telling ""update will"" I'd walk spot. I'd rather homeless sacrifice capitalist gods. 

These people soldiers firefighters, sign put lives line. make them? Yup, coworker mine suspected covid case (was refused testing beginning US outbreak young) presumed positive.

After got covid, ended extremely nasty case strep throat. one positive of. immune system likely weak properly fight off. 50s fairly healthy besides leg pain issues long hours working. missed ""not"", live FL; issue entire US. state setting records regularly too; really small compared Florida put hold 20 minutes releasing it. unfortunately people call virus hoax unironically, irony easily lost make obvious. See podcast setails:, however:

""African scientists developed reliable, quick cheap testing method could used worldwide basis mass testing programmes.

The method, produces highly accurate results, built around mathematical algorithms developed African Institute Mathematical Sciences Kigali. speak Neil Turok founded institute, Leon Mutesa Professor human genetics government coronavirus task force, Wilfred Ndifon, mathematical biologist devised algorithm."" Wow, so, it‚Äôs likely 15,000 last week‚Äôs number. growth rate, would likely closer 25,000 per day. 

What‚Äôs terrifying death rate following similar path, delayed 3.5 weeks. this, new cases deaths stabilized roughly 900 33 couple months. 

If Florida since grown 25,000, that‚Äôs 27x rise. deaths trail, Fla would around 900 deaths per day early August. 

Also, growth today‚Äôs death rate 900 would happen toward end 3.5 weeks, policy Florida unlikely get serious catastrophic September already impossible prevent. Sounds like took Benadryl make sleepy dizzy maybe? Disney expedition. tough (and importantly, contagious) you. Point is, might COVID, hurrah? guess? banned late night alcohol sales? Like major issue? think typo. 90+32 122 :) Florida enters chat r/sUbSiFeLlFoR   10% cases happened last 5 days. said team, players. allowed onto campus, guests self-quarantine week, quarantine tested least every day three days either home market outside NBA's campus Orlando. Anyone tests positive period allowed enter NBA campus.

But prison. It'll work one fucks up, we're talking months hundreds, maybe thousands, people team, guests, service workers. I'm hoping best, I'm expecting season finish. true giant failure. Good news! crisis really pulling back curtain, it? Yeah I've even seen official health department statements making mistake. surprising. Sending blender carry counting cash, fucking criminals. Even Trump loses, he'll still stay power 6 months, toll January 20th. That's 150,000 dead Americans.

""Go vote"" works many situations, one. pick slogans faster payoff. I'd really curious reporter reporting park weekend going? mean, that's new stance.

There's faction country responds school shootings complete refusal explore new gun laws proposes arm teachers conceivable solution stomach. people think police schools helps even though Parkland police ran hid instead helping Supreme Court long held police immediately render aid situation. 

The people support always willing sacrifice teachers.

Heck, they're willing sacrifice sake eCoNoMy pushed keep things open insane outbreaks states. excuse this? Eh yes did? weeks ago testing capacity got speed demand lol. beginning Sweden using test trace method quickly realised infection spread way capacity. lead changing strategy mitigation instead. Seriously try act like informed ridiculing article anyone actually know happen look like complete idiot. Again. fail see point. 

So clear, position don‚Äôt understand matters, lie say asymptomatic spread isn‚Äôt rare? 

No. 

Absolutely not. 

Not going happen. Sorry. Scientific accuracy always. Anything post hill gets instantly deleted, weird. Captain obvious- nothing see folks official number currently 133,000

For reason double number head wrote this... thinking 260K deaths. 30% (very) *roughly* 100K.

I stand don‚Äôt trust scientists?

Not implicitly, no. Scientists people, people biases. think 'science' spouting misinformation suits purposes, treating religion human endeavor. highly charged, political topic... *will* produce biases within scientific community whether acknowledge not.

I'm sure could easily find examples something claims 'scientific' pick apart believe (surely find website espouses ""creation science"", example). simple assert 'because *science*, must true' really great position take. I've seen 'science' flip flop dozens topics lifetime. become problem expand umbrella constitutes 'science' include things psychology sociology. similar disciplines may valid areas study, would hardly consider 'science'. general scientific consensus come originate lab. said that; independent scientists, even US military says likely naturally occurring virus.

There's point looking direction better, promising avenues pursue.

Science says follow evidence. evidence pointing away labs. science.

Conspiracy points labs source. science waste time, money, resources. that‚Äôs old school smosh food battle reference many people got reading article don‚Äôt know matches headline. know transmission occurred elevator surfaces? whole building A/C unit &amp; that‚Äôs virus transmitted? Distance learning safer likely cheaper option lot districts. really feel staff guaranteed work laid time being, putting many lives risk sake normalcy. There's teacher sub shortage country is. can't imagine happen outbreak starts schools. takes one person. Unfortunately, states going find money continue operate deficit hope November turns right. fair hold schools hostage like this. one works restaurant bar spending much rent studio can't really get by, give studio move roommates. unreasonable everyone able afford place.

Without that, point argument?

As far understand, asymptomatic aspect COVOD-19 least understood, talking like hard rock science. isn‚Äôt part reopening plan, part normal benefits program. government enough BS own, don‚Äôt need exaggerate it.

Yes, ultra rare underlying condition ""Having lungs"" study done April, didn‚Äôt know much spreads. much better hypothesis today, know now, aerosols and/or sneeze infected woman left probably small elevator infected everyone. You‚Äôre trying edgy raise great point- many died NY took appropriate steps fix it. Southern states watching happen aren‚Äôt enough stop it. blueprint intent watching people die instead.

Or, know, get back work can‚Äôt stay home kids forever. Covid-pocalypse crowd never seems consider things.


But yeah! Keep going! Covid problem counts right now! Except week 4th july everyone streamed PA camps fast cars could take them. was...well gobsmacked. take account daily counts reset midnight GMT.

My partner cut years ago much happier without Disney craze have. like act exactly like expected movie life go would huge mental breakdown. 

I'm talking things like forgetting pickles. Really dumb things. failure handling covid19. symptom real failure.

***The real failure country without leadership***. took one major calamity expose complete leadership vacuum exists Washington. get leadership, US unprepared national emergency, matter is. proof positive shit like masks social distancing powerful tools world's arsenal COVID moment yet everyone page. done shit start probably could semi-normal summer! 

Way fucking go NYC Cuomo who, nothing else, say part world's fight thing. Dumb (band) dumber (crowd). idea degree true, it‚Äôs happening reverse too. 


I personally met someone hospital put someone covid death car crash killed them, autopsy tested covid. 


Higher covid deaths means PPE allocation hospitals, causing something arms race. 


Again, *no idea* much skews data deaths don‚Äôt know prevalent practice is. wonder. two-week / two-week cycle thing sounds like good idea. don‚Äôt remember 

Check again. It‚Äôs included actual reporting time, including interview transcripts, parts keep quoting. last heard, effective dosages hydroxychloroquine kill covid19 pretty close poison-and-disable patient medicine dose.   Basically, don‚Äôt take outside hospital. know way out. future America look like them. they're flailing wailing.

If can't handle are, northeast US great. New England great. politics fine, even Republicans still kind rational, there's enough social cohesion pride stuff like bend Covid curve. We're highly educated wealthy northern Europe. Schools good. Winter rough hey 4 months so.

Otoh anyone ever says ""for intensive purposes"" downvote person oblivion. mean downvote once. People florida city aren‚Äôt wearing masks grocery store literally want scream every single one haven‚Äòt locked whole state mind-blowing. outbreak going stop?

There sweeping regulation nationwide mail ballots. state even decided send unsolicited mail ballots forms citizens. ripe rigging. Best stop everyone claims Trump used rig favor.

Mail ballots around elderly handicapped outside US. That's fair even many going uncounted. Nothing virus obvious. 

For instance, France studies suggested prophylactic nicotine patches may improve odds. Thank you!! Shut damn county Newsome.  don‚Äôt mean sort bad way, simply interesting take... India one perfect case death graphs I‚Äôve ever seen. barely deviation growth absolutely consistent. don‚Äôt know lying stats what, can‚Äôt imagine seeing lore perfect graph anything. Go check out, except one random day, graph almost smooth line. Coronavirus isn‚Äôt one virus either. What's going Florida huh? mild strain corona. miracle drugs state got. 

Mostly Florida pretty aggressive locking nursing homes, vulnerable population. 40% deaths us nursing homes, Florida approach, troubling families, effective keeping deaths lower.

The difference come demographics infection. median age cases trending 60ish 40 going result better outcomes.

But think accurate say daily deaths rising. seem going me. getting it. highest risk circumstance eating doors less 6 feet STILL relatively low risk comes social situations COVID.

Also note CDC guidelines fails differentiate indoor outdoor seating, problem. know point risks indoor outdoor seating same. reason indoor dining yet allowed NYC. learned ECE189 spring UCLA! wear one. Bro /s

If people might follow example cautious. Maybe even admit background support arrogance. Nobody smug, you‚Äôre definitely ass. People literally happy worst bad pandemic hard hit state. sure you‚Äôre getting triggered that, ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Recent studies show protect too, reducing risk getting 65%. cautious one-third people around think virus hoax wear mask? Let's pretend we're total control exposure risk here. Huh? non-stop stories entire sunbelt, including California. Texas Arizona arguably bad worse Florida, southern California right behind.

Like Texas, Florida currently GOP governor legislature.

Unlike Texas, Florida already mail-in ballots option anyone years. Texas elderly meet criteria mailed ballot. Taking care needy important skill. schools teach this? immune system never fucks around, feel like shit get sick. blunt, utilitarian - Minimum wage workers quickly replaced get sick, nurses doctors cannot. ...because he's public health expert?  New Yorker, really pisses off. plenty time anticipate prepare imminent, knew way virus time arrived, are. ""This page thinks themselves""

Thats problem right sister spewing bullshit ""not judging people time"". Um, what? Fuck going putting others risk lol what? Judging them? I'm criticizing them, i'm angry them, fuck ""judging"" them. happy deleted facebook ago too, although still see idiots social media that's fault.

Glad i'm one still stuck home since March. going work working home? 3 7 percent, 17 30. That's asymptomatic presymptomatic together exactly come conclusion bunch people alcohol withdrawal going lighten burden Healthcare system.... actually opposite though, people refuse wear masks end spreading virus getting others sick. wait -20 Florida would like word. Diabetes fake, bro. eau d'shit Miller's brand about. Probably going work well Obama-Gate. entire contry see happening soonish. Another thing read supposedly trying skew numbers states reopen, sure true is. Mickey Donald demand blood sacrifice.  imagine trumps ass tho ü§¢ care.

Running breathe dying. help? data public yet? really it‚Äôs getting frustrating. state‚Äôs cases exploding people still refusing take care others. Life take long get back normal dumbasses like Chapter 1: Wuhan

Chapter 2: Italy

Chapter 3: Toilet paper

Chapter 4: New York

Chapter 5: Brazil

Chapter 6: Lockdowns ending

Chapter 7: ever fuck happen USA Covid brown person. know super vague remember US around mil cases, reported 1000 - 2000 joined online community/support groups discuss ongoing symptoms COVID. Factor could another 2000 - 4000 reporting ongoing symptoms anywhere 3000 - 6000 / million ongoing health issues. Super rough ballpark estimate, think issue know enough yet. people certainly exist there. testing backlog probably catching Still higher numbers schools closed.

Like Cuomo said, we‚Äôve climbed mountain Sir Edmund Hillary‚Äôs words best, getting top half journey.

We still climbing journey still deadly.

EDIT: Yes, totally understand volume testing versus then. Guess I‚Äôm really saying aren‚Äôt woods yet. yesterday reported ONE kid daycare center (near Syracuse) ended resulting 17 people getting sick. Florida here.

We hit 15k cases today. Disney World open.

With lovely people like makes Americans go ""I travel across land, searching far wide""? effing pandemic!? 

When Ireland spike cases, allowed leave 2 kilometer area around house. US goes road trips, takes flights, etc. get it. Limit effing mobility! Scheisse hardest hit areas, areas people needed go out, half tested positive already. Right aren‚Äôt even reopened yet, New Jersey asked even loans continue partial shutdown, struggling super hard sustain longer. Eventually near complete reopen come around 1k cases daily financial prospect keep getting dire state. cases likely go well again, US culture overall higher risk tolerance, likely can‚Äôt stop surge either. Also certainly can‚Äôt afford current partial shutdown much longer, cases stayed around 500-1k going further. runaway disaster. completely avoidable. leaders- starting top way local level- who‚Äôve downplaying virus knew coming, months prepare, nothing. need removed. remember VOTE time comes. stating facts, problem feeling lectured. cant get everything open cases exploding.

But ""leader"" mean ""controlling wealth,"" I'd say maybe vatican Putin. followed sub super closely, maybe there, sort estimate % people persistent problems initial recovery? assume that's extremely difficult measure moment, definitely feel like there's ton confirmation bias people reddit saying they're using inhaler etc., I'm hard time parsing extreme is. long immunity period Even Florida small miracle catching 1 5 cases would around 500k per week. June probably 5-10% infected. end July well 20% least.


If pattern holds elsewhere virus begin decline within weeks. 15300 today NY numbers still overall worse state. would say NY done well means. literally don‚Äôt know answer yet.  could well right. could wrong. could immunity lasts couple months. don‚Äôt know, determined know, need operate entirely possible. actually say yet? going feed ‚Äúmy oxygen‚Äù crowd though.

Oh gosh, something went totally wrong response duplicated different response. Sorry, I‚Äôm old. re-write it:

The test number reflected current number tests administered day prior. positive case results tests administered 7-10 days ago processed.

Nothing going increase compliance across USofA team mascots, cheerleaders, professional wrestlers, Disney characters, start wearing masks...this stuff fodder script writers TV shows like Simpsons. Can't test there's demand. Netherlands test lot beginning. since June 1st people allowed get test whatever reason. prepared 30,000 tests day, never really reached 10,000 tests day, there's really demand higher amount testing. barriers testing. positivity rate keeps falling, sitting around 0,5% currently. exactly. extreme method stopped covid track. way. New Zealand's method extreme, also succeeded.

The reason USA fked right becuz country politically divisive. Plurality voting system fked whole country turn multi-party system working together working other. everything one party thinks right thing immediately seen ""conspiracy discredit party"".

Also, total lack leadership downplay disease, confusing messages gov scientists beginning contributed state country right now. accounts todays case count vs past week two, said. ""For weeks now"" ambigous I'll admit.

Last week:

9929 cases

70k tests

Today:

15299 cases

143k tests

That's todays numbers. They're awful, worse 1 week ago, matter much want believe it. Never. Never stop caring. Soviet Russia.....yeah, whatever. even possible? property taxes already really low TN? could easily close $1000 increase per year lot places. People work... get wrong, taxes need collected continue functionality government surely better ways that... might stupid strategy 

It‚Äôs stupid strategy. takes die it.

They averaged ~35 deaths/day 5/15-7/1, adding ~1000 cases/day near beginning say 6/15. seeing deaths creep spike infections, 3 weeks seems entirely reasonable.

Updated Sunday, 12 July 2020 - 13:21

To ""surprise"" people charge La Torrasa nursing home, several elderly tested positive latest PCR tests already suffered Covid-19 weeks months before

The eight elderly people La Torrassa residence L'Hospitalet de Llobregat (Barcelona) tested positive COVID PCR asymptomatic five already passed disease months before, according tests carried people admitted centre.

The residence belongs foundation La Torrassa Serveis la Depend√®ncia manager, Pedro Ardite, explained Efe arranged administration 80% places.

The residence, explained manager, center considered ""green"", case COVID-19, worker same, lives neighborhood La Torrassa, reported feel well symptoms coronavirus.

From moment on, center adopted safety protocols, contacted Health services, prohibited visits began perform PCR tests inmates workers.

When tested elderly, detected eight positive cases, ""surprise"" charge centre five ""repositionings"", is, people who, weeks months before, passed IDOC positive PCR 15 days tested negative tested positive again.

Moreover, five cases three new ones asymptomatic, present ""even tenths fever"".

As two workers tested positive, one one given notice, resident La Torrassa - outbreak disease - other, also symptoms, vacation 19 days contact sick residents.

They gone street

Pedro Ardite explained that, since elderly sick people asymptomatic, knew COVID six gone street, alone relatives, walk, two not.

The residence closed since first alarm given, sick isolated person charge assures PIDs necessary material.

Visits allowed, families, especially whose elderly COVID, informed email, mobile phone application telephone calls.

Translated (free version) ridiculous number clinical trials vaccine candidates running now. They‚Äôre moving slowly, either...

no, moving slowly reality vaccine measure effectiveness safety time. vaccine protects 3 months going yield much benefit. Better nothing going fixed end year. obviously don‚Äôt understand data. NY running around 1% positive. tested entire population single day you‚Äôd get 200,000 positives, severe lack understanding you‚Äôd freak out. 

Number tests percent positives absolutely critical pieces data. Nobody saying FL well right now, it‚Äôs trying analytical realistic rather hysterical fearmongering. No, lives others, blame him. I'm ideal scenario, yes. Everyone would forced get literal force necessary. I'm policy maker. Sorry happened you. got fired area‚Äôs grocery stores ran food told boss needed try get food family (a friend card restaurant surplus store took shopping) okayed night fired next day. Tried telling irresponsible couldn‚Äôt relied on. back April north east, hit especially hard. work hot spot. stupid. 

I never missed day work that. Joke though, ended making amount pandemic insurance haven‚Äôt gotten sick. Although guess we‚Äôll see laughing two weeks 600 ends. mean finally fell ‚Äúhoax‚Äù? southern states economically decimated, shame given poorly run they've already been. *mostly. They're still sneaking Exactly. people Bumfuck, Texas much lower risk. major urban areas huge full people country/world, population density means much faster spread. one size fits solution; urban areas need power impose restrictions appropriate situation. 15,000 new people coronavirus reported today Florida, state eager supress data minimize bad headlines. think Florida willingly putting higher numbers needs , especially Disney opens, bridge Everglades sell people. true number higher. can't think anything American sending children contract virus protect profits. really, Einstein phrase ‚Äúfar likely‚Äù conveys high level confidence me. author doesn‚Äôt enough data high level confidence reinfection. It‚Äôs inappropriate write subject high level confidence.

The excerpt provided actually initial comment based on. know author acknowledges they‚Äôre 100% dead set reinfection, appreciate that. problem author‚Äôs assertion reinfection far likely cause patient testing positive twice. Wow! Sunday too. Quick open schools GOP convention. thats jsut death rate. forget potential long lasting effects virus. Also becomes seasonal immunity repeat every year top regular flu.. really. Daily case increases reliant testing numbers. find significant positive case ratio. number positives rising faster testing, problem. currently majority states. quite frankly recipe disaster.

While deaths dropping, little reported RECOVERY rates. Death RATE dropping proportion cases. Thats good, result huge effort healthcare workers. Deaths proportion RESOLVED CASES isnt changing. be? people supported hospital, cured. may indicate simply pushing deaths, 3-4 weeks onset earlier 1-2 weeks. Better, gives time solve patients individual issues, means stockpiling fuel future bonfire, removing fuel curing patients.

So important numbers watch ratios, raw numbers: ratio positive total tests, ratio CUMULATIVE hospitalizations total cases. rates tell us disease progressing.  rate beds occupied tells us close Armageddon.

Oh, FYI, US WHOLE, majority states numbers heading cliff. Barring drastic change attitudes, im starting think may late stop. states looking worst disaster history. Point taken. worries. I'm prickly. Got stared hostile manner one anti masker today. Specifically, 17.9% infections asymptomatic (5), found presymptomatic stage asymptomatic infections account 48% 3.4% transmission, respectively (Fig. 1A). Considering greater asymptomatic proportion 30.8% reported another empirical study (6), presymptomatic phase asymptomatic infections account 47% 6.6% transmission, respectively (Fig. 1B).

Asymptomatic transmission is, far know, relatively rare. Pre-symptomatic transmission not. whatever idiot on, totally pointless.

he rotten putrid inside, even virus wants enter grotesque body. 851 888 surge... Punish getting infected virus?  Utah‚Äôs cost living national average: don‚Äôt believe Wikipedia article linked provides argument fact public school funding lacking. mean, adequate? Maybe look college readiness rather graduation rates. states top 10 article worst college readiness metrics entire country. Minnesota - 32nd college readiness
5. Alaska - 43rd
9. Iowa - 41st
10. Utah - 34th

To me, college Utah felt like catch-up vs. states prepared students, even higher education attainment numbers within state (if you‚Äôre attending UVU, SLCC, U) seem skewed regard. end covering would considered high school level material states first years college Utah. We've two days 5k+ cases based test administered date. soon labs catch up. prob 80-100k tests queue right processing. Safer yes, Covid raging county bubble highly likely brought in.

The housekeeping, kitchen, maintenance staff service bubble quarantined. weakness. Every governor attempted put measures place publicly condemned POTUS. Facebook feed immediately turned bunch physicists masks became thing. Never heard word microns mentioned many times (and actual physicist). India fascist, authoritarian Hindu nationalist government. Anyone believes thing say fucking moron. Duh. THANKS, REGAN

(and thanks REGAN, gun control laws, designed keep minorities owning weapons)  strain FL appears contagious that

There scientific consensus thay strain materially different point coronaviruses mutate slower rate flu viruses, wluld also expect materially different strain point.

Be careful people keep posting articles trying push idea. People going super rude here. deleted post minutes ago extremely rude two people were. you, would call hotel ask they‚Äôre hosting covid19 nurses patients are. Ask extra precautions they‚Äôre taking ensure everyone‚Äôs safety Heath. Make decision based that. trip unnecessary would advise reconsider. it‚Äôs something necessary extra careful. Wear mask filter. Buy hand sanitizer wipes minimize contact people objects much possible. Floriduh fucked. knows voting idiots get killed. means 15000 people actually contracted virus week two ago that. spent last couple days test spreading it.
And means 10 days 1500 need admitted 20 days 150 die. 
The maths pretty simple, albeit depressing. Seriously?

Fucking Netflix tracks location, Angry Birds tracked locations. weather app does. 

Google Apple know everywhere already

But fucking problem?

Unbelievable ignorance March? Fuck you, Mr. President. renewed lockdown, CM well known record lying suppressing journalism successive failures. Jesus Christ aren‚Äôt locking ? Yup, anyways lol. Might rethinking near future. I'm saying wrong gotta realize state reviews things different. NJ, reported 50 deaths July 8th half deaths June even earlier. reported state conspiracy theory. deaths occur, like cases, reporting gets worse. look delay CDC experiencing delays reporting well, I've read still 30k deaths occured last 3 months. Conspiracy nuts say keep death rates Florida reviewing every death certificate lag going keep getting worse. subreddit replete bunch layman also doom-and-gloomers want sensationalist possible. Seriously, even ‚ÄúGood News‚Äù flairs top comments essentially ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that, know world ending never vaccine.‚Äù want preserve mental health pandemic, stay sub. think would reasonable request doesn‚Äôt seem requested don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre page qualifies ‚Äúevidence‚Äù.

Your anecdote got twice *potential* data point. doesn‚Äôt carry weight case thoroughly studied. 

If expert deep dive situation publish something saying reinfected, experience would considered evidence subreddit. According military spouse sister, they‚Äôre exempt state quarantining get home, even abroad. Many commanders requiring anyway, thankfully.

It would surprise also exempt testing go abroad, although you‚Äôd think host nation would something say that. Takes 7 days Santa Barbara county California. Got tested yesterday told. see long really takes. 

What‚Äôs scary got tested 2 months ago took 24 hours. testing gotten worse time gone on. would thought.

I hope asympamatic spreading next week. Virus spread, politics guide schools, doctors say. 

No shit, everyone IQ's 60 say. consequential Floridaman.  Tragically, actually need award else fuckwit cult start wearing them. Fuck.

I feel like we're praising way 3 year old for.using potty.

Putting mask POINT TIME like putting rubber right soon starts going labor. Fuckin idiot rumors things Ghislaine Maxwell world leaders true...we‚Äôre getting wild ride anytime soon, even pandemic ends 2021. 

Imagine things like 15% unemployment, foreclosures, ex-presidents getting arrested sex crimes. revolution. Hes wearing masks, television seen governor? fucking way. lockdowns city-based he'll probably try overrule those. know people feeling sick tested exposure, tested positive feel better need two negative tests go back work.

But even sick line ridiculous. know sick person could it. wont fake hits close home, bro  They‚Äôre literally going give people disability this. Watch.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs psychotic think they‚Äôre crippling country purpose. there‚Äôs significant enough wealth gap country, becomes wonderland rich. Everything done America right done deliberately*, widen gap/eradicate middle class. 
And unfortunately 50% population falls it...at certain point admit country deserves it.

The thing that‚Äôs resulted progress/change wide spread riots evidently. think changes police funding would happened weren‚Äôt tons things getting destroyed attracting attention it. 

When rioting solution serious glaring issue educated person see, know don‚Äôt live first world country anymore.

They‚Äôd start throwing shit place, least demonstrate true civil disobedience form keep schools open people aren‚Äôt gonna lots people die. No, it‚Äôs luxury, it‚Äôs necessity achieved everyone got fucking program wore mask, testing adequate, people stayed away other. 

FFS can‚Äôt like, ‚ÄúI wanna risk health millions barely-tested vaccine‚Äù disease isn‚Äôt Nipah.

**‚ÄúFirst, harm‚Äù**

Even Ebola Virus vaccines went every stage. She'll gone November moment soon. mask later feel unsure feel pretty safe,‚Äù said Salutatorian Raegan Boettcher, Troy Buchanan High School.

You go event without mask. exposed soon walk gain sense self preservation later brought mask.

Explain low bar class name salutatorian. Sometimes gotta plug it. Cold reset. think he‚Äôs basically saying since results taking long process. positives see today actually attributed tests given two weeks ago.

If someone went get tested today wouldn‚Äôt see results another weeks. Indicating probably people infected reported.

It‚Äôs kinda hard accurate time process tests takes longer viruses incubation infection period.

I guess also adds it‚Äôs bit difficult separate number tests given number positives percent unless report infections:completed tests infections:all tests given state. mmmmm think ""Karens"" people complaining people playground sports playing neighborhood kids, ones talking freedom c u You‚Äôre 100% correct 6‚Äô rule social distance implementation utterly arbitrary. perfect laboratory-scenario completely dead air ppi ‚Äúcovid aerosol‚Äù 6‚Äô rule still remains completely arbitrary fact exposed microns ppi covid regardless indoor air movement. It‚Äôs pseudo-intellectuals think 6‚Äô magic number, can‚Äôt argue retention-to-reiteration rate statistical analytics low need time go Google find sources ends accumulation ‚Äústatistics‚Äù bear relevance physical environment would find real world many factors play. That‚Äôs turn politics. It‚Äôs easier argue. state driving pensions ground, expect around time need it. Also, pay 2200 deductible, 5500 pocket max 'great' healthcare, addition saving retirement meager state wages. Japan Sweden either those... fine. thought de ja vu found [the article study author Q &amp; A. problem- find one friends well. Otherwise access one either. Yes That‚Äôs felt tldr bullets necessary. Still middle seats open definitely help vs packed plane, even pre covid times prefer rub elbows germs strangers possible:) First,the cdc report specify parameters per 100k figure. Check page 10 report I‚Äôve said.

Next, bringing article third time doesn‚Äôt exactly improve case. It‚Äôs fucking riddle. plenty undiagnosed cases. That‚Äôs best exemplified New York, 405k confirmed cases 32k deaths. Covid high death rate. 

So you‚Äôre right, means illness infectious flu based R0 data, least twice deadly (given last seasonal flu 35 million cases 60k dead), causing hospitals fill capacity states don‚Äôt mandate masks social distancing. Florida, Arizona, Texas principally. there‚Äôs still people heart attacks cancer emergencies, can‚Äôt receive care die too. 


And you‚Äôre still gonna care mask joke coughing? Man you‚Äôre rude awakening, rate it‚Äôs you, it‚Äôll one family members, friends. Let‚Äôs check back year, see did. UK try tactic wimping shutting everything down? lol, funny still list non-residents separately they've trying exclude make number look better since April. taking 1% total cases, help much now. love 38 new infections ‚Äúgetting hand‚Äù them. Maybe we‚Äôd mentality, wouldn‚Äôt living shit storm right now. disagreeing that. presenting data. Per capita means shouldn‚Äôt matter population is. says (Asymptomatic + Presymptomatic) Symptomatic.

You're arguing says (Asymptomatic Symptomatic) also (Presymptomatic Symptomatic).

If say ""(9 + 4) greater 11"" I'm implying 9 greater 11 4 greater 11. TBH think Governor, Cuomo included, expecting let Federal Gov't. reasonable expectation Feds would take charge pandemic response. took realize states really ""on own"" NY first worst affected figure everything real time help previous experience guide. right hand column positive rate, averaged could inside air conditioned homes, that's excuse. god damned age internet, give guy fucking platform already. Also long ass list 1995 http://www.uchinanchu.org/history/list_of_crimes.htm bought house pool past fall. still social distancing, making store trips unless it‚Äôs necessary, limited social circle children. friends couldn‚Äôt get bars, gyms, travels Florida places restaurants quick enough (no masks) lockdowns lifted. I‚Äôve tell few, asked.. couldn‚Äôt come gave zero fucks explaining why. I‚Äôm trying mean, I‚Äôm trying get sick die. think mainstream media covers anything positive pertaining covid. That's problem. need look stock marketing investing websites look working vaccine, happens framework ""invest stock price takes off."" also apply cells? entire world criticizing violating human rights

The US politicized lockdowns heavily meant enact similar measures home, they're fucked. 

NZ fucking they're covid free now. mean know happens, there's something else feels feels weird, off, even lightest symptoms feels different. odd feeling literally best descriptor. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lie here? like look cases per 1M people stat too.  charities help pay bills. lot got federal money form government. Thanks info. unbelievable find strangers reddit state health department give fuck that.

The fewer people going public schools larger market share is. study shows slightly half infections come pre-symptomatic (mainly) asymptomatic people, ‚Äúmost‚Äù lower proportion would guessed. going public, visiting friends, etc. probably without mask showing symptoms consistent virus? get symptoms sometimes tough identify, people may choose work financial necessity, preventing household transmission difficult, study seems suggest irresponsible people there. Phylogenetic bracketing Occam‚Äôs razor would suggest COVID immunity similar closest relatives SARS MERS, produce fairly solid immunity. Note COVID closely related Coronaviruses cause colds.

This similar figured non-Avian dinosaurs closely related birds feathers. Yeah that's smarter way it. sense get smaller firm could get ugly revenue long, smart right now. 

Hoping get place San Diego stay cut travel altogether months. Vietnam locked 150 cases. China locked 500 cases. Italy locked 5000 cases. America locked Northeast Northwest. Meanwhile cases continued spread South. South infect North Northern states legally allowed ban Southerners entering Northerners vacationing South.

The entire shitshow could prevented New England Cascadia allowed secede. manager making trans thing opposed worker's rights issue. really hope so, see, work Toronto. reflexively downvoted article. Breaking point incoming. Almost teachers know *want* back classroom‚Äîonline education joke. 

That said, recognize isn‚Äôt worth risk pandemic raging unchecked many areas. think argue people believe virus would get China continents infect many. Kind like SARS virus years ago killed people outside Asia. reached Italy deaths skyrocket way thinking really stopped worldwide. Yes was. asked risks travel pandemic. I'll believe say, India lacks testing capability number tracking capability China possesses, we've already seen many cases countries under-reporting enough testing. people die pneumonia faraway village testing capability information person's death reaches central authorities many weeks later (if all), going add overall tally?

I hope that's case, likely India many poor countries undercounting cases. Aye man I‚Äôll first line itüòÇ hope others close total number new cases entire US months ago. Ffff... October surprised order food order drink bar. got back morning taken June 27th (Fort Lauderdale) Chyeah, saw coming.

I don‚Äôt even personally believe came lab think that‚Äôs BS. Newsom blood hands. r u srs Unfortunately reports hospitals capacity, followed many tents stadiums rate going.

Testing serious issue. Going surge blind ‚Äúworst case scenario‚Äù researchers scientists (notice left Gov leaders) data base true recommendations on, opening/closing schools, lockdowns cities/states, reopening, etc. etc.

The first lockdown prevent exact situation diving head-first into. Leadership failed us every single level. ignored science. ignored warnings scientists researchers warned coming go all-in ok ramping testing, PPE, contact tracing, developing strict plans follow, etc.

And so... are. Facing warned ‚Äúcould‚Äù happen year back March. probably designed make transition longer shut smoother people freak. like telling kid car we'll 10 minutes it'll more. everyone needs treatment, there's definitely do. 
 
Case point, NY thing. Shutdowns announced 2 week increments even though everyone room knew it'll longer. possible, unlikely, patient single infection lasted three months. Covid-19 patients (now dubbed ‚Äúlong haulers‚Äù) appear suffer persistent infections symptoms.
I believe far likely patient fully recovered first infection, caught Covid-19 second time exposed young adult family member virus. unable get antibody test first infection, know whether immune system mounted effective antibody response opinion, patient‚Äôs experience serves warning sign several fronts.
First, trajectory moderate initial infection followed severe reinfection suggests novel coronavirus might share tendencies viruses dengue fever, suffer severe illness time contract disease.

It‚Äôs good author includes words like ‚Äúmight‚Äù, opinion author thinks smoking gun, especially clear first excerpt cited. That's correlation biological male (your DNA represents male) taking female hormones. lowers immune system cause cardiovascular issues. definitely want hormone therapy coronavirus outbreak. finding virus causes vascular disease want put extra stress circulatory system pandemic.

Correcting hormone imbalance creating hormone imbalance. I'd rather HOA lawless neighbors whatever want impunity. I'm talking people water lawns, assholes stuff disturbs peace. exponential growth babyyyy Oh silly American Exactly. Seriously. People think little hand sanitizer standing six feet back someone store preventing deaths. Give break. really happened disease ran course. people crediting politicians success failure beyond me. would expect deaths peak areas country obesity epidemic, nothing who's charge. simple factor average intelligence Americans, become [in whiney voice] *toooooo haaaard*. thumbnail pisses off. hope fauci isn‚Äôt afraid fucking power tripping idiot know 20-member church group Houston going NY two weeks. Donny 2 strokes. 

The brain kind. needs new $40milion dollar yacht guys, don‚Äôt greedy. /s chosen go much farther, compliance takes nosedive. 

Imagine trying tell people keep 10 15 feet distance other? would next impossible public settings. unfortunately, people realize that, many would likely opt abandon distancing altogether rather try get close guidelines possible. elevated BMI. great shape. 

I longer defend statement her. opt pick apart need go inward. GA least me, got tested July 2 haven‚Äôt gotten result yet. New York city lol. quite rural. Notice didnt downvote posts like child lol. cocky reddit douche ima put place.

If snippet text book would teach student damn fucking thing. dumb. Dont say anything gonna pretentious douchebag. Yeah, anyone set halfway decent looking website, scrape filler content together throw wild-ass, unsubstantiated content fuel whatever fire want days. knows one pretty easy sniff literally one click. never said things repair broken leg, something brain/neurological/subconscious mind, self-hypnosis &amp; NLP definitely help. 
 
Sometimes stressful events(like fighting new virus cytokine storm) put brain/nervous system mental trauma body(immune system) gets stuck hightened alert state. cases doctors helpful, hurt explore alternative solutions like self-hypnosis &amp; NLP. 
 
Look videos ""spontaneous recovery"" YouTube. people recovered chronic pain using self-hypnosis. can't imagine look excess deaths explicitly remove COVID-19 puts excess deaths associated COVID-19 67k-140k

Maybe could link talking about.

But seems ""COVID-19 pneumonia, excluding influenza pneumonia"" accurate number (according CDC). almost like purposefully obfuscating data everyone take 119k number run it. Covid mean died it. 119k number ""Deaths confirmed presumed COVID-19"". wonder we're still sending kids back school month, cuz not. r/theydidthemath many fearmongers sub, wonder echo chamber. Yea police still don‚Äôt wear masks. went ones DC. Police, secret service, ATF, DEA, DHS went open faced those. shit ton people height them. 

It‚Äôs kind funny mayor tells everyone wear masks, city police don‚Äôt lol. Man love season 2020 mental state wears thin days...who's getting table payments here. mean, let's stop pretending like case. company supposed bring electricity Puerto Rico Hurricanes. company supposed provide PPE early days pandemic (and provided mini soda bottles instead test tubes), raiding PPP this? I've enough :( mom. it‚Äôs great terrible  us planes right now, small measure comfort even though probably doesnt help much.

Airlines requiring masks far know Delta middle seat empty thing. probably starting to. first get ill enough go hospital would starting get results. numbers yet. people aware it‚Äôs clear patient tested positive twice. 

That's true... ""reinfection"" one possible reasons, means people much cautious *their* conclusion ""herd immunity"" fallback position, else fail.

That doctor clearly stating article, proved ""reinfection"" possible, safer assume is.

Hope best, plan worst. called ""precautionary principle"". developed country rolling saying ‚Äúwell fuck let‚Äôs roll rampant keep paying people $10 hour risk lives‚Äù

We don‚Äôt know long term impacts virus health age group - anecdotal reports neurological symptoms go well beyond 1-3 weeks sick for. 

What happens everyone supposed go work get sick there‚Äôs room hospital? numbers seeing right not. Good. At. All. NY LOCKED 10,000 cases per day still ramped 18,000 plateauing - deaths still took weeks stop rising. 

What‚Äôs good economy people aren‚Äôt willing go spend? good small business running gets someone family killed?

Our handling virus bullet point Q2 financial reports attitudes actions back led us making record breaking case numbers 5 months pandemic. angel investor shell corporation help seed money called TotallyNotDonnyAndJared Inc  I'm interested read waivers say. feel like they're probably glanced ""by clicking accept accept terms agreement"" kind thing purchasing tickets online person. Well well, coincidence... literally nobody gained defense infection that'd pretty obvious now.  

I know many assume nothing thing diffusing air probably good thing means breath travel far, primary mechanism behind masks blocking droplets rather air? doesn‚Äôt affect opinion article, stand behind critique 100% better evidence comes topic. person trans anything? Even elderly adults also teachers? actually saying? bioinforic? I‚Äôm you! friends small gatherings went OBX last weekend. Haha beer 2 neighbors, driveway, 10 feet apart. Idk everyone thinks it‚Äôs safe. re-open doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs safe means room ICU. Russia, vaccine shoots you. Narcissistic rage HOPEFULLY, population people included 15,000 total skew younger hospitalization death rates high. 

That said, we‚Äôre still tough spot. It‚Äôs 38 new infections. things considered, that‚Äôs good masks likely contributed low number. Somebody please explain people wearing fucking mask? best going save life worse cause slight inconvenience. nonconformist? Florida truly fucked friends ex-husband Michigan wears shirt says governor idiot. know real idiot is. great NY! meant Florida, Arizona, Texas processes put place USA stop virus based droplet. cotton masks 6' rule based upon theory droplet transmission. problem already saying transmission surfaces minimal admission primarily aerosol. Fauci reversed aerosol.  trum said testing capacities limited Lol hot take probably accurate. pay taxes then. like idea. nuke Florida maybe covid mutate become sentient say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired playing easy mode‚Äù switch whatever hard mode country they‚Äôll Dark Souls it. correct. 4.2% account people currently COVID recovered died yet.

Enjoy day, bored me.

Just know lord Jesus loves you, he'll always heart. classify outbreak? tinfoil

I theory movie never box office hit purpose. producers, maybe studio something. point.

I think went straight video might misremembering that. Exactly! kept protocol looking number cases instead time frames would much better position. 

It's frustrating. 

And, no, seem care much overall health citizens. baffling healthy citizens basis healthy economy thing people want look at. habe quarantine know result? germany stay home 2-4 days take test done SARS, MERS, HIV, Ebola, Zika, H1N1 recent microbiotic foes proven easy vaccinate for. I'm aware zero widely-circulated vaccines amongst diverse recent crop viruses. 

An case HIV, global priority many decades üòï attest FL's lackadaisical attitude toward pandemic. one taking seriously. extortion crime humanity. Playing summer American Boner Jam. south carolina stupid people, lot people wearing masks, trying practice social distancing usually still close, numerous idiots holding massive parties, wearing masks, saw yesterday; woman took mask sneeze put back on... Oh shit!!! may glitched glitched Matrix!! Exactly. Wait see numbers look like next Saturday. predict 35k/day Florida within 2 weeks. Florida trying win ‚Äúwho coronavirus cases‚Äù game Actually idea Guam post. Funny, Guam nearer Philippines Japan US. 

Further readings shows following:-

""After World War II, Guam Organic Act 1950 established Guam unincorporated organized territory United States, provided structure island's civilian government, granted people U.S. citizenship. Governor Guam federally appointed 1968, Guam Elective Governor Act provided office's popular election.[19]:242 Since Guam U.S. state, U.S. citizens residing Guam allowed vote president congressional representative non-voting member.[5] do, however, get vote party delegates presidential primaries. ""

Sounds like people Guam less rights actual Americans. that?  kind shitty thing, politician really can't win things like happen. wish would hillary, agree political candidates really know death toll would lower. 6 European countries deaths per capita US, 5 US states deaths per capita  we, grocery store employees, try tell cant come without mask get beaten shot. Miss rona ain't gonna nowhere long long long long long time üëÅüëÑüëÅ GA? Deaths decline

I dunno numbers looking deaths GA [up since last week  Nice see Disney finally admitting it‚Äôs really money, magic. Why? Coronaviruses known conferring long term immunity.

Why certain one different? evidence have? U even go shop. takes one case infect thousands Old driver take lol Triage deaths would certainly awful. agree.

The thing even NYC never reached level. hospitals overall NYC never ran resources.


NYC's hospitalizations actually peaked late MARCH (30th 31st remember). media acting like NYC midst chaos April already peaked declining. 


No State come anywhere closest capacity issues. Arizona maybe ""worst"" even regards ICU beds still around 10% flat 2 weeks now. include 15% surge capacity.


Outside NYC nobody really come even remotely close issues ""running beds"". much worse year get New York full New Yorkers. Florida full Floridamen. looks better mask. Truly. level greed stupidity unreal point. way short term profits going even come close covering economic fallout gets bad signs say will. immoral unethical sure, whole idea gonna good economy likely even true. hell real driving factor here? Saying community spread east west coast, like saying Europe spread Italy. technically true, look published numbers, still wrong. Yes, east west coast hit earlier harder. that's economic power centers US people much mobile long distances. reason rest US saw cases late tests available were, working. took US end April actually get testing level par rest world (and still lower end).

So whole data US produced mid April severely underestimate real extension spread, point data China believable. That's people looking early, worldwide spread looking genomics data. much easier tell virus went through, many people it. best all: fact. data tells us, virus entered US least 3 different paths: China west coast, China east coast, China UK east coast. hard say exactly virus entered US, guessing mutation data, somewhen early January mid February. second half February, several strains mutated US found way France Spain spread UK, Germany countries. multiple strains came Atlantic virus must spend either considerable time US infected many people (both promote number mutations).

From data, early cases Europe, one could even conclude US infections back early December, get caught, nobody knew yet. unlike Europe, taking biopsies later analysis expensive US done regularly. (this know first cases Europe must November/December) ESL? You‚Äôre conflating critique unfounded conclusion another unfounded conclusion. data paper support conclusion immunity COVID-19. It‚Äôs observation serum immune cells that‚Äôs well understood.

In immunology rely antibody titers assess vaccine efficacy. There‚Äôs reason that. Absolutely. Bad news good news, say. remember listening news local protests 90s... Im wondering yesterdays 100k outlier terms much test thats going forward. 

If drop back 50-60k, I'm guessing we'll see 20-25% daily Understandable, honest. woman never worked public schools day life. probably 10 nannies raise children. hell tell someone else best child? Woo number one!!!! Asking reddit boycott Marvel lost cause. college highest risk? people don‚Äôt comply wear mask, it‚Äôd spread sure, among young people statistically less risk. older professors hopefully teach homes professors maintain considerable distance students. Cafeteria workers also maintain distance, wear masks, make food put without ever touching students‚Äô hands. 

The issue schools. won‚Äôt able force elementary school kids wear masks day, come contact teachers guardians (of older) every single day. majority college students live alone college students, whereas almost elementary, middle, high school students live guardian significantly older them. 

If US reopening Disney World, bars, casinos, least form in-person education actually positive impact future. they‚Äôre bringing home ‚Äúcomplimentary parting gift remember stay‚Äù? concerns aside...It baffles people willing pay full price half experience

Full price wish. forgetting COVID fees.  Sweet summer child. list growing decade. 

This even 10% bodily failures play result this. Turns breathing circulation important.  Link CUNY page. Visited site can‚Äôt find it. think colleges open many things students need open. Many grad students need open. Students pursuing undergraduate research project need open. Students taking classes labs practicals crucial part need open. see many people calling complete shutdown colleges don‚Äôt even consider many students need open access crucial facilities, research labs. Sweden‚Äôs case counts deaths plummeting even without herd immunity. Collapse. Speaking kroger employee, didnt even keep ""Hero Pay"" extra 2 dollars giving us def wont hire security. Kroger one last implement extra $2 hour first take back MAY. MAY. Places like target implemented permanent $15 hour. pandemic really showing true colors companies really gives least little bit shit. Florida Florida Walt Nazi surprised face here. could kept control. Instead opened up.

Schools aren‚Äôt going owning up. said makes complaints look small... think immense pressure reopen. Florida‚Äôs unemployment system broken long time ago wasn‚Äôt even really solvent mass unemployment. Florida wanted 80,000 employees Disney furloughed system ASAP. Plus, Florida residents still reporting getting paid yet, randomly getting kicked go back process. Disney likely getting pressure reopen employees too, need steady paycheck Florida safety net failed them. know someone going Disney next week, worry, they're driving they're afraid covid flight üôÑüôÑ I'll counter doubling masks wearing face shield. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope one got inspired week off. 13. Argument still holds. US flipped 13 untraceable cases, wouldn‚Äôt right now. Thank much. lost dad 18, mom left. makes mad think putting life danger 9th grade drop-out MUCH smarter damn scientists. ""The COVID-19 pandemic brought multiple levels stress people's lives across country world. People worried families becoming ill, dealing economic emotional issues, societal problems potential loneliness isolation,"" said Ankur Kalra, M.D., Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Sections Invasive Interventional Cardiology Regional Cardiovascular Medicine, led study. ""The stress physical effects bodies hearts, evidenced increasing diagnoses stress cardiomyopathy experiencing.""

Makes sense. stressful fuckin times. thought first, trying figure earth anyone could claim *coughing* would side effect hormone therapy. mean, eventually going cause massive civil unrest people start beating shit assholes. mean Utah group organizes covid 19 hotspots. Cases lag actual incidents 1-3 weeks due onset symptoms testing delays.

Hospitalizations lag cases two weeks so.

Deaths lag hospitalization two weeks so.

The numbers Florida report months astonishing. Maybe 25k cases day, record hospitalizations every single day (more come go months end), deaths could hit 250 day more. depends lab processing results. 8-10 days standard Florida keys. Enjoy new rides, like It‚Äôs much smaller world sure visit Blood Clot Center too! stats say % New York City already infected?

Is possible already reached ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù least point majority already infected it‚Äôs likely numbers go up? (Aka party goers people deliberately break rules got infected) anyone explain covid testing works?

I heard don‚Äôt test actually says covid test check symptoms make assumptions based compare them? Honestly terrible mental health, though I‚Äôd agree right it‚Äôs bit worse mentally. closing outdoor areas like hiking trails natural swimming areas even though don‚Äôt contribute spread much lockdown frustrated ways try maintain mental health. Also, lockdown, felt like stay way go cases getting control. I‚Äôm point I‚Äôd ok second shutdown feels like terrible mental health situation either way.  time people nonewnormal sub shame teachers concerns ""entitled"" etc. say ""go teachers sub shame yourself"". going misanthrop shit... visit people one time.

This actually pushed sensible countries, see it, even sub, visiting anyone treated like kind criminal act. grow lot family gatherings mother black sheep family. grow socializing friend groups prefer spend one-on-one time people, telling big party anything me. 

But see people talking hugged parents months they've taking precautions, makes sense me. one brought protests right. one wants admit. get saying. Doctor confirmed reinfection: also seeing lot 1st hand accounts reinfection /r/Coronaviruspositive Yes are. I‚Äôm teacher admin sent us video make class dividers using foam board. mandatory masks, reduction class size. I‚Äôve district 8 years, 9 August. didn‚Äôt think could lawsuit doctor paperwork early FMLA. number. They'll watch fox News tell America fewest cases world, they'll call information fake news. Czech, wear facemask everywhere outside home two three months....

Do want people wear masks? Make mandatory. support heavy fines. Enforce vigorously. comply, americans well. forced comply, although borderline obsessed freedom. choice.

But know... never vote people made mandatory. emotions towards pushed strictly negative. choice, lsot control life. forget forgive that.

So yes, comply. love afterwards, speak. u/GlobalTravelR, got coronavirus, going now?  Honestly, flu (which im still hopign get), Id fill bottle saliva spray everywhere go. Elevators, ramps, staircases, items grocery store, etc That's it, I'm boycotting Amway. Well would purchasing overpriced low quality items. Houston primary mission control missions. completely missed point making. wasn‚Äôt asking traveling. asking specifically risks staying hotel. Even hypothetically. You‚Äôre clearly unfit answer question move along. That's unfortunate. really useful test. gives people confirmation, gives idea prevalent virus community. I'd guess European countries this, hope do.
But work Finland? know take action test? test differently? family U.S .:, say since January..one awful flu , felt like glass lungs , high temp 103 3 days..
Told flu ..and found newspaper January..Big Story Coby Bryan ..little side column Covid ..lol. .
Oh well..ü§û radiolab episode Six feet chosen studies done flu default distance recommend coronavirus hit. love is? üò≠  So... people wear masks everywhere practice social distancing... eating drinking without mask social distancing ok? No, logic doesn‚Äôt hold scientifically. Yes, outside safer, it‚Äôs completely safe. even close. know what, absolutely correct reasoning. Plus police officers attacking executing people *huge* aspect chaos. You‚Äôve changed mind. Bush would handled COVID better.  true. point future scientists look sky see galaxies. wrongly conclude galaxy galaxy entirety universe. evidence dark energy Big Bang existed. way prevent write ensure knowledge never lost gone forever.  Unless forced long exposure someone indoors, N95 bit overkill. Plus really need leave supply chain health care workers. cloth (cotton, polyester) mask sufficient around also wearing one. Im San Diego, got tested month ago literally got results online chart within five hours.

Yesterday said they're actually reducing testing nationwide supply shortages. even hit hard, seems like massive step backwards. idiot governors going ruin states got control. Everyone family Florida. There's way stays contained. would insanely frustrating scientist day age. title thread ""is safe go outside covid 19"". remember protests people OUTSIDE thousands. upstate NY *really* northeast tho? I'll ignore childish insult treat like adult sake discussion. We'll see deserve it. would directly contradict research showing large protests contribute Covid spread. per capita EU US? cages built previous administration. march towards fascism bi-partisan. Uh, no? chop Florida let float away..? whole state? mild symptoms meet second wave, might remove belief totally agree nobody likes told do. makes sense may justify initial reluctance wear masks overwhelming evidence proving efficacy masks, thier excuse now? Yeah well. shitty based memes U die covid without misc  expound this? following you. (Not arguing.) Covid kill them. Greetings Florida... see public freak horse balloon Disney Turn FBI ISIS training videos  Well sets 'feared life' ambience self defense hopefully obvious one morons eventually gets shot themselves. That's deserve. Guns used stop covid all. Well mean that? little evidence reinfection possible think safe say would eventually possible. Also NYC's great numbers helped fact least fifth citizens immune (according antibody tests). lot question t-cell immunity antibodies percent needed herd immunity know bad it'll get certainly possible. stole buddy, thanks shoutout! Exactly. can, mean should. Good job zero fucks go folks circle run around wonder dont want see them.
Hello supposed go year. Would first time going ever age 36 sons first time going, he‚Äôs 5 :( 

Totally worth risk though we‚Äôll keep saving money. Maybe save enough visit Japan day Trump Administration already disregarded constitution many times, what's one right? Fair enough. read Cells sounds like research much progress.

I still think huge gamble think natural herd immunity would work, least know right now.

I'm glad live Canada least managed reasonably well. DeVos go teach person class kids starting August NY herd immunity. Florida want looking 100-200 thousand deaths. Realistically though Florida porous complex many people places catch vulnerable outbreaks local hospital overflow long time.

Flattening curve opening smart better economy shooting herd immunity. guarantee it.

If Florida's plan, practically speaking exact thing plan.  vaccine could happen two months friend ""..State X.. largest single-day increase COVID-19 cases state far.""

Journalism become copy paste, it'll continue like there's sign virus' spread stopping time soon. Somewhere, Greg Abbott calling Ron DeSantis thanking feel bad Disney park employees. Imagine amount anti-maskers going throw temper tantrums poor 18 year old ride operators park hosts going deal shit. corona carrier sure. stupidity almost certainly led idiot taking precautions possibly infected. Even he's infected corona, he's confirmed infected extreme stupidity bordering retartedness. loss Ireland either way. Still waiting Mother's Day spike South Korea ? maybe.

Japan? definitely not. China definitely open Japan still hundreds new cases every day.

It funny people deeply shit , view happening distorted. People blame Trump definitely isn‚Äôt helping. got sneak attacked Italy Italy even reported cases. Border closing absolutely would happened later whatever pandemic response Hillary would nullified NY. would one termed like Trump meaning far deadlier 2nd wave would likely taken place Trump president 2nd run. way lucky 2016. Wtf that‚Äôs awful. america psychosis put much confidence rationality humans, think purpose, people die virus, almost like murder right? ever okay? Several european countries legalized regulated sex-work takes place brothels, Germany, countries legalized regulated brothels still legal outside that. Maybe shouldn‚Äôt fund government taxes since fail protect us wear masks smiles painted on, what's problem? Okay trumper Young people fine. message isn‚Äôt them. So, long losing kids/teens ratio loss teachers, problem, right? /s good first step. needs jailed fraud set example. kidding, 3 year old wore mask doctor complaints all. adults straight temper tantrums masks. Immunity proof going happen. impossible research. That's getting vague studies, can.

They studies based mechanisms understand seen previously.

Edit: look language components immune system body use mount response.

You're technically correct, however:

Florida (7/12)- 15,299 cases (**142,981 tests**) 

New York (4/15)- 11,571 cases (**26,869 tests**) vaccine spring, don‚Äôt get another two three years can‚Äôt manufacture freaking needles... think give up. quaratined never contact players.

I find opposite generally true.

It would seem wears one ut needed.

If around 10-15 random people would wear mask? lets say around 10-15 people around regularly. constantly tested. always wear masks. Social distancing practice. What's point wearing mask posturing? beat NY's high. I‚Äôm OC told 3-5 days, Kaiser, sure infrastructure gives better processing times what. One friends Riverside County tested 2nd still waiting results. state wants Disney open collect tax revenue. Yes, destroy country people get idiots US. work nicely. area picking ny. havent store since end February clue people wearing not. went doctors office everyone one. see lot people parties masks, going together see cases picking area. live upstate. like common sense point? State worker here. Ive noticed push get everyone back office.  supervisor made clear someone high power doesnt like people working safely effectively home.  Boomer cant handle it... can't wait he's office world's problems suddenly solved coronavirus mysteriously stops reported much states, liberals ones gloating ""great"" america like back 2009... One problem ""per capita"" numbers smaller EU nations would appropriate compare single US states even large US cities.

A small nation look pristine ""wave"" hits, look horrible after. nation 3 million people one cities outbreak, would similar impact national per capita rate situation 100 cities similar size US outbreaks once.

Per capita definitely useful, really appropriate directly compare per capita rates nations one 100x total population and/or land mass. Different effects come play, similar numbers may actually reflect different circumstances. Better ‚ÄúGoofenwald‚Äù.

2-14 days symptoms manifest. 
1-3 days see get worse (I hear they're telling people wait
2 days get test results. hear that's optimistic
1-2 weeks late, gets worse, go hospital 
1-2 months later die

If younger healthier infection, it'll take longer die.

Happy Thanksgiving Merry Christmas, everyone! scary thing could sealed re-election made millions MAGA MASKS. he's fuckin stupid. Dude, even ""welcome back"" shirts sale people going nuts.

America always need enemy, China, Russia. economy tanks, China abused trade intellectual property. jackshit leader got elected, Russia's evil plots. 

Americans cope reality adversaries responsible failure. tell people Republican party die out, meant. 

I would rather people live *learn* mistakes. study seems accurate. true. Ireland still open U.S tourists.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* IFR still hold hospitals overrun? Like IFR absolutely nothing help anyone everyone got time? you‚Äôre country like Japan cases reason American base new cases popping ü§î Feb. 29, CDC Jesus said need change behavior yet. idea he's 4-6 months late ridiculous. March/early April, asking people stop wearing masks trending social media. [it‚Äôs already working [Here](http://edsuom.com/covid19/Arizona.png) plot ‚Äúmultiple growth regime‚Äù model number reported cases, fitted New York Times dataset Arizona yesterday. haven‚Äôt updated today takes couple hours 20 states counties I‚Äôm tracking, picture clear enough: likely 200,000 reported cases AZ end month.

Considering CDC director‚Äôs recent assessment ten times many actual cases reported cases, means *one fourth* Arizona‚Äôs population may wind infected summer.

So much winning. never go full asymptote. Holy shit. knew going happen didn‚Äôt think would happen soon. know economy needs open can‚Äôt force economy open people scared &amp; don‚Äôt trust governments handling virus. Can‚Äôt close again, bills pay. Unless government going start handing money actual people choice.

I one going become homeless virus low mortality, unless you‚Äôre nursing home. I'm going go limb guess taking insurance away people born medical conditions bad. 8% cases required hospitalization though?  little brother thirty year old disc golfer lives home parents texts like fucking 12 year old, denies covid/masks.

Well, certainly blowing stereotype water, he? What's reddit account name? Stupid stupid 
And boy stupid follow rise far delay deaths 2 weeks ago reflects *infections* occurred 5-6 weeks ago things weren‚Äôt making anything noticeable blip increases cases. (Florida reported fewer 700 cases June 1 compared daily 10k we‚Äôre seeing now).

Reporting isn‚Äôt exactly slower now, it‚Äôs we‚Äôre catching infections earlier increased testing. one point testing reserved sickest death reporting came much sooner distorted view numbers ‚Äúshould‚Äù look. catch infections numbers week two they‚Äôll potentially hospitalized instead they‚Äôre hospital. said morons, Mormons. Meanwhile 70,000 people per day infected basic measure prevent transmission almost entirely. that's *confirmed* cases. We're exponential growth curve again. 

The people go Walmart without mask given current circumstances almost surely refuse vaccine. delusional man. March 23, Rt dropped 59%, whilst still clearly downward trend.

Then March 23 March 26 (not 29th), Rt dropped another 8.3% get 1.

Are really going tell lockdown reason 8.3% drop? Even though noticeable change path Rt curve?

You're pushing agenda look chart come conclusion without lockdown, UK gone 1. Yes, agree. many people think hoax, ‚Äúexcess deaths‚Äù nothing concerned about, crazy. sub getting depressed, maybe it‚Äôs time unsub. Fortunately MN okay relative rest America. keep worrying family, wondering end. Americans general need brain damage.  Japan, here. Japan virtually cases relative us, literally proof. pure ignorance. I'm furious Japan. worry Although doesn‚Äôt affect you, anti-vaxxers shouldn‚Äôt choice. important part vaccines, similar importance isolation due Covid, protecting can‚Äôt protect themselves. People weakened immune systems CAN‚ÄôT get vaccinated, get sick they‚Äôre serious risk dying. goal vaccinate many possible prevent spread disease keep people like safe. Anti-vaxxers choice. selfish pieces shit. see.

So again, whole world said jumping cliff would protect eeevil Covid, would it? really take look responses comments. One guy said he‚Äôd eating popcorn watching mom die we‚Äôre Americans. She‚Äôs doctor, way. sibling rivalry you‚Äôre from? people follow Trump massively emboldened election office, result happened interference Russia ran, first hacking parties' communications (but leaking Democrats, likely using Republican information leverage Republican leaders), running disinformation campaign social media.

Trump slim margin (and win popular vote period) completely facilitated enemy state long-standing plan something like this. I'm sure else say it, past that. school year start? amount infections even puppet governors change plans. Like thousands people die day number keeps increasing. (that probably starts weeks) person probably get covid day live streamed everything showing symptoms. People take several days develop them. increase testing get similar increase cases. Shows really aren‚Äôt catching lot cases point. knows true numbers are... Living Arizona sickens me. rather, hope everything doesn‚Äôt sicken me. Even monumental increase cases still people refusing wear masks. Mohave county Colorado river several lakes, we‚Äôve seen huge influx visitors California, started memorial day. weeks numbers exploded. city finally weekend closed beaches access boat ramps ‚Äì ‚Äì Friday Saturday Sundays, everything‚Äôs open rest week.

Meanwhile local Hatebook groups it‚Äôs finding ways get beaches ramps. Restaurants supposed half capacity see parking lots full virus ever arrived. truly shit show.

Edit: Oh lockdown, county sheriff publicly announced would enforcing it. Yep, stupid. things pop mind could work...

a) flights bad states. Phoenix Boston? Fuck that. Atlanta NYC? Fuck too. flights halted new cases / million drop 150.   
b) reserving hotel night, credit card address needs safe state. not, hotel room you.     
c) fact, work visa/mastercard/amex disable credit cards home addresses Arizona, Georgia, Texas, Cali etc working states healthy number cases.


Easy logic would be:

If % positive 10% new cases / 150, 100% shut states lower numbers.

50 - 150 positive rate 10% still penalty box, maybe flights allowed. bring COVID test slip though. fly, get hotel room use credit card again.

Below 50 positive cases per million per day positive rate 3% safe bubble travel.

Sure, want drive Arizona Boston relatives, can't stop you, would surely drop 99% travelers sheer fucking inconvenience. Wear mask, idiot.  Thanks Desantis bet someone told linked COVID-19 erectile dysfunction something actually cares getting. made statement based knew time

No didn't, knew time masks actually protected individuals contracting respitory diseases. known years years COVID. health professionals wear first shoulders largest part blame anti-maskers Trump talking point yet another deflection

He absolutely shoulder largest blame. sure current administration put corner lie American public tell ""they work, please buy US government failing miserably ensuring healthcare workers PPE need.""

But lie still lie, statement *did* help sow distrust expert opinion. mean particularly fault, change said. Guys....please stop go erroneous comma. typo, I‚Äôm aware can‚Äôt make go away. Stop messaging comma. Thanks. really work/take many years/cost millions lives Dude, that's like new cases Russia, UK EU put together. Florida. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  helping others aren‚Äôt communism.  
Fair point, testing capacity greatly expanded since then, point basically DeSantis want seem admit problem troublesome Yeah, talking comments saying Americans wear mask. Ayo????????? Yall remember late Mac Miller used say. SOMEBODY SOMETHING!!!! mean, heard you‚Äôre island sale. Gotta spruce curb appeal. Hope enough paper towels clean ocean. know sounds crazy thing mask deniers listen forced them.. Yes. This. Let's bother facts thoroughly substantiated scientific research. support comic book induced theories. Definitely seems mindset. Ahh yes whattaboutism, perfect response! Trump's actions forgiven! Genius! Nevertheless, comparing Lombardia Sweden, Italy implemented complete hard lockdown, awful amount deaths. either something went terribly wrong Lombardia Sweden something right. Pants masks off! sure burn 1 million die Really, link data? aware. testing though. Don‚Äôt look ones. Also note according John‚Äôs Hopkins university, US leads world testing per capita, cases could appear higher even countries worse.

But maybe right, maybe places far worse here, don‚Äôt know Masks aren‚Äôt gonna keep getting it, it‚Äôs going keep spreading it. would made difference whether wore mask. honestly get covered more. China already vaccinating army shot they're fairly confident in, even though made way entire vetting process.

Somebody /r/COVID19 said epidemiologists public policy officials staying silent major vaccine progress they're afraid good news cause widespread relaxing social distancing, lead influx cases vaccine deployed.

IDK, kind get that. I'm tired common perception we're nowhere near end this, fact we're getting fairly close beginning end. 

I'd surprised things look like 2019 one year now. think going look like weeks! exponential growth we're talking Florida done much anything clamp things. point even know Florida anything curb growth virus. 

Seriously, looking Florida's numbers utterly terrifying. leader So, let get straight.

You citing people wrong time, try prove were...wrong? I'm sure trying prove. 

You seem want drag politics this. 

He late, along anyone else listen January. schools like exactly time prepare? Headline August 28, 2020: ‚ÄúNew hotspots emerge across US direct connection travelers went Disney World. Florida Gov insists infected outside Florida urges citizens go crowded bars.‚Äù big house I‚Äôve stomach issues since say maybe 8 so. like run bathroom panic issues digestive issues around. Bowl stuff, cramps, heartburn, acid made life miserable. thought normal everyone issues often too. got older got worse mid 20s got really really bad. Discovered like 28 went paleo diet gluten dairy body like. Except cheese. never stuck it. 36 pandemic new terrible eczema past 2 years finally gone back strict diet. Easier stuck home. 

Lost 50lbs (this time good needed loss) major stomach, cognitive, new skin issues. I‚Äôm pretty much eating rice chicken :( 

But feel like different person. great way. get sick early feb still last effects that. believe Covid. Tumblr leaking. 


If yall wondering good part people vote republican. Yet also highly unlikely get number? guess millions non-chinese citizens living splendid job providing intelligence saw ""their eyes"" respective countries outbreak first begun! Thanks virus successfully contained!  Currently live here. 
At stores mandate see masks time (mostly)
But around apartment always see people bringing guests hang out. Big groups 5-10 people. 
Mostly young. upsetting believe they‚Äôll fine. Percentages don‚Äôt matter many people die long term health issues lack social distancing. How's vaccine SARS 1 doing?
Oh one 20 years.
What makes think magically create vaccine SARS 2? Sounds potentially correlated age. never said anything degree. argument isnt ideology, refusal wear masks. associated rest argument head. Im also pointing effort save businesses well money went well ppl didnt realy need it. Tom Brady also got millions. dont seem grasp system keep business alive abused. Furthermore ignorant presumptive dont seems realize lockdown blame everything likely return people dont wear masks. SNP policy, lest forget think Canada able avoid second wave long as:

1) travelers Canada quarantine 14 days (and enforced) 
2) US/Canada land border stays closed non-essential travel. 

We'd better very, conservative lifting those. think anti-science bias USA. think fair statement first world countries expected embrace science research. going US little disappointing regarding this. 

A science-based culture requires education. say educated people US, far truth......there many highly educated highly intelligent people US......but......lack education critical thinking looked upon like countries, think. 

And course, many people may disagree. that's fine. Bud Federal government laughing stock world right now. can‚Äôt even fight frigging virus. Quit watching Fox News ffs primaries primary elections occurred states already showed case. people really pissed current state government willing go vote it. Hey listen Caulk Soccer handle little soccer handle little covid. Rona Ron doubling ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs waiting room.‚Äù

We leadership. everything keep loved ones safe. won‚Äôt get help decision makers. first thought reading title: fucking kidding me?! He's *wearing mask.*

Second thought: Somebody reminded hospitals lots ""real"" germs could get sick. probably he's worried COVID.  Poor guy looks done shit pic. go might opportunity encourage engage less risky behaviors. Tennessee well. ridiculous. another new record!? USA! USA! USA! number 1 said that? Here's thing:

Trump personification evil. every way lives life. sins constantly, could never decent human being. office insult America rest world, well major security risk. needs office, replaces inconsequential. There's way worse. Total inaction would better dumpster fire presidency. USA! USA! USA! Nobody pandemics like us. Nobody! ones mostly wearing masks? fucking talking about? unlikely? actually happened. something wrong you? Even election.

This pandemic likely second wave emerging right around December, time crowded day-before-Thanksgiving NYE barcrawls crowded malls stores Black Friday shopping.


I know expect working, mass-produced, affordable vaccine, see happening next summer.


In meantime, red hat people increasingly sad going leader-picking event, absolutely apoplectic idol loses. nationwide response lasts months various false ideas ""liberal revanchism"" starts spreading pro-truhmp groups. Exponential growth happens faster everyone thinks. clean backyard trying come cookout! clean think did. fucking dare Disney visited solely locals. People cram airplanes fly there. drive, stop gas stations restaurants way across country. NY, CT, NJ, governors coordinating. CT even better NY stats. NJ well too, deaths going people saying adding cases people probably died covid they're actually going wrong direction hopefully. think Hillary president would overall much lower death count, republicans would lambasting (much smaller) death count. Imagine alternate-universe 2020 campaign ad- ‚ÄúClinton asleep wheel catastrophe 3x larger 9/11. let 10,000 Americans die watch. need effective leader stop COVID tracks, someone take charge make right calls instead puppet unelected group unknown scientists. make America great again, Trump 2020.‚Äù anybody vote person voted for?  They're still wanted ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø can't compare Sweden small densely populated region Italy. spread massive small region locked down.

As said, makes much sense Sweden compare comparable countries Nordic region.

It looks very, bad Sweden surely see they've made huge shameful mistakes. Yea amazing! Never heard antibodies going away month cases virus hasnt mutated! almost like absolute bullshit! shit keeps getting stacked ontop put fear people. 

Is virus real? course. killing people? Certainly. majority hospitals overwhelemed? even close. keep hearing bullshit rhetoric social distance wear masks protect neighbor. actual reality illness kills old risk people. Young people dying outliers, happens EVERY disease. world acts like dealing Ebola thats case. home delivery amazon, risk stay home. Simple that.

Please tell vaccine going effective antibodies dont last month? Im even close antivaxx thats case incredibly ineffective. hear 2 conflicting sides, 1 antibodies dont last 2 vaccine give antibodies save you! one it? cant trust anything read anymore, even research. become game think less liar? Mile long lines look good Don‚Äôt worry DeSantis control 
/s I'm IT. plenty people younger boomers idea things either... usually people like ""politician resign"" trite reactive stance take DeSantis shown completely incapable leading crisis, crisis completely beyond capacity. step branch covidians

Perfect. forget many blacks say wear masks want shot 'robbers' Karen's call police them. real concern them. FWIW, I'm glad upstate spared worst far. control states. ask, why? Idk trolling 12 year old good luck whatever message trying spread.   Sounds like mindset argues Chicago gun free zone yet somehow guns. That's shingles works. Shingles chicken pox virus (which never leaves system getting it) flaring back unknown reason. get chicken pox first get shingles. I‚Äôve come accept likely won‚Äôt leaving state long, long time much insanity going elsewhere US. It‚Äôs sad see, especially given bad got NY, many parts country don‚Äôt seemed learned *anything* it.  Theres need ""think"". idiots saying said bringing numbers heavily skewed shredded look good think, thats problem. Im sure deep know wrong, maybe honestly, many idiots still denying crippling US, ironically hurting country leap defend enthusiastically social media. I‚Äôm sorry, that‚Äôs awful. severe neutropenia going chemo cold landed hospital nearly week. can‚Äôt imagine going right now. asked two neighbors long time gun owners help educate her. target shot 500+ rounds knows clean gun early June last spoke her. virus while. political point numbers supposedly inflated liberal hospital employees themselves. 

Last night heard government flying Mexicans Arizona hospitals black helicopters fill space make numbers look good, released told find way home... course means going take money welfare system illegal immigrant now.

How fucked America believing shit? 2/3 god. Angry white conservatives infiltrated city, see still slow things lot.

Does constitution guarantee air transit?

Does guarantee allowed stay hotel?

Does guarantee credit card working states?

We LOT probably drop travel 99% without getting even near constitutional right. false account. 200k people got pneumonia year folks, bad bout pneumonia... Nothing see... COVID liberal lefts controlling attitude ... cost coworker, friends grandparents, nurses doctors, bunch *numbers*! Totally worth could‚Äôve made impact March. 100k Japanese nationals living China, I'm sure better idea situation sure got voted, education vital foundation healthy society start kids. fact America value education much say do, rushed open entertainment venues instead preparing send kids back school safely.  never actually diagnosed COVID? Natural Selection. fight elements, build homes protect us, vehicles move around faster, tools jobs efficiently, end stupidity. Lack education problem. applies everyone. White rural conservatives passed racist outdated ideologies generation generation cycle continues. Poor inner city minorities robbed chance educated funding communities general systemic racism we've seen full unapologetic display. know ""macrosegragation"" word lot people grow bubbles never rarely interacting people different ethnicities. guess that's see people walking around proudly dropping n-bombs even they're filmed. embarrassing know share country lot people also don¬¥t know ramifications it...a lot people seem long term health issues apparently

so yeah.

it¬¥s nightmare. teachers use private instant message conversation abuse children. Again, profanity personal attacks. even read comments made discussion others would learn something? fucking sad pathetic probably bit late redeem now. people need hear far bullshit listen. counties regions controlled spread? cause many problems Okinawa I‚Äôm surprised they‚Äôre still allowed Japan. Japanese unhappy relatively COVID-free country negligently infected walking coronavirus hotbeds US soldiers, walk area stationed in, interact locals, sometimes even rent flats quarantines, without military command allowing local government access information regarding coming out, might confirmed carrying COVID-19. spreading virus community, Okinawa already seen deaths it. looking someone blame???? daily avalanche heartbreak lately. None needed happen again! chew something.

That got laugh here! want google something quick, google ""did floyd protests spike corana virus cases"" tell find. Instead proudly, loudly parroting incorrectness, fix it. Unless course one guys spouts scientific finding conservative views (read: mostly it) deep state conspiracies. Naturally since like, 50 idiots showed lockdown protests most, also spike it. morons protesting rights literally cause others harm, governments reccomendations. Ironically enough, arguing STILL MONTHS LATER liberty potentially end someone elses life disease. guy started chain sounds dumb anyone else claiming protests spiked this. ~~meek~~ introverts shall inherit earth. Lub Dub name half-ogre barbarian DnD campaign, thanks extra laugh. best description ""trickle economics"" I've seen Reddit. can't seem find it, gist is:

It used called ""horse-and-sparrow"" theory. idea overfeed horse, undigested oats pass digestive tract mostly whole sparrows pick horse's feces eat oats. modern America, horse overfed, turns around ravenously devours feces try keep sparrows getting any. sound like write manifesto go shoot church....  everyone Texas religiously wore masks, line would flatten 2-3 weeks, I'd think.

Look trends. Look non-lock down.

Ponder. help people know people minor flu. experience ranges feeling nothing excruciating, isolated death. people see painful side, may sober realize mask least worries.

So many, now, huge sunk cost belief though. Hard say go.

To state obvious: better leadership needed. Almost like New York flattened curve-- followed CDC guidelines stated infection rates 14-day decline--before opening back responsibly unlike many states south currently experiencing massive surge.

Just quit behind. embarrassing yourself. waiting countries made adequate response COVID start opening borders other. point, US, Brazil others essentially banned every country world. happens, Trump threaten legal action ? Ngl going it‚Äôs half crowded doesn‚Äôt sound bad I'm saddened hear sorry.

This virus wildly unpredictable terrifying.

My sister law heavily pregnant (3rd trimester), theory shielding. though, terrified catch shopping without mask (she says 'no one else wears see point').

It keeps awake worrying it/her safety, brushes threat nonchalantly 28, eyes risk. Deaths don‚Äôt matter, quarterly profits do.

/s normalization obesity

when everyone fat obese, considered ""out place"" risky thing. also scare crap Well, we've collecting data 6 months. confident hard assertions rates we've observed bigger set recovered patients, longer time. mean, researcher asks, ""How well recovered patients 18 months infection?"" obviously, it'll years answer. Sometimes good science slow. [Perineum kooks never go away find new weird shit doing. non-visitors? visitors spread virus them. Can't state sue Disney negligence? agree. sucks, like wish could find another job pays better, pandemic I‚Äôm grateful job all. Yup saw two parents pushing newborn car seat grocery store. neglectful, one could stayed home baby freaking ordered groceries online calling Arizona Florida #2 bit stretch Right, case fatality ratio still much lower AZ Europe.

Doesn‚Äôt make whole difference, makes much different story.  yep wanna finally jump pirates ride sit little desert island scene skelton stuck wall sword drink..... issue go work. work retail I'm currently helping set entire new store new city. 16+ us work fairly confined spaces, break room 10x20ft room, masks required break. heavy manual labor, required wear mask it, many us remove occasionally actually breath. Imagine trying workout mask 11 hours day that's do. 

Arguably, simply setting new store time issue masks happen. But, need money. pay rent. buy food. can't work home. can't stay indoors. get extra $2/hr, I'm 22, I'm overweight. seasonal allergies, ever get worried allergies growing severe, I'm basically point going doctor get tested would mean loosing least 2 weeks pay. can't get evicted lose apartment. 

If makes jerk, honestly. hate state affairs currently, know I'm alone there. I'm really sure else people like could do... highest 10000?

Yikes, thats massive jump Guess guilt getting him.

He's exposing insurance companies working single payer well 10 years now. He's regular Thom Hartmann's show. like interview ""the guilt getting him."" Weve heatwave ontario last week. feel like could die I'm wearing mask long time. know do? try go dont need like responsible citizen. feel like canadians different mindset Americans. seem focused personal freedoms seem focused community responsibility. Yes so.... ? changes nothing. closer 6 times, due exponential growth. agree public good. virus discriminate. 

Just extending ""lack correlation protests spread"" Disney's reopening. people yelling close quarters outside correlate spread, neither Disney's context. know college students interact people outside age group, right? spend hours time rooms faculty members, old. spend time interacting academic advisors, housing advisors, parking reps, librarians, food servers, financial aid representatives, cleaning staff, security, name few. 

Then mingling, students go see parents. pay visit aunt cousin. go community. Even argue young people less likely personally experience negative effects, unnecessary exposure others enough give person pause.

Things taught online fall be, thus freeing space things can't taught way socially distanced. man island. Depending person, might backfire encourage even reckless spite.
