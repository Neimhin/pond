0,2021-02-18," Idk comments get downvoted. It’s like people think facing reality fear mongering. think really look one dose people who've tested positive (and feeling are, although they're usually cautious decisions foreign counterparts) . There's lot emerging research indicating prior infection acts prime first dose acts booster, second dose giving meaningful increase antibody levels. Read Worst X-Man Ever storyline make feel better proves ridiculously disproportionate response been. 20M years life lost heart disease, cancer stroke every year US alone. Yea get that, honestly knows, may even still wear mask Disney. mask mandates stay forever. CDC bound tell everyone don’t mask public anymore point. US mainly came tracing, still near nonexistent. Also everyone isolated, whereas US there’s national system place there’s stopping it, except waiting majority population get vaccinated.

And asymptomatic spread likely isn’t factor would pop contacts test well, cases they’ve having. Please god CDC says median age someone dying Covid 78 years old. serious butchering data get 16 years lost life per death. Masks stay, Less flu, less colds, less sick days. need every advantage get catch China. Better vaccinate everyone wants vaccine single booster given else lockdowns thing past  feel that... rather feel almost nothing, time. don’t accept would reduce numbers meaningful way. Anyone thinks shortage soldiers America either doesn’t know they’re talking about, think it’s excuse recruit children. 

As showed earlier stopped recruiting children there’d still 150,000 new recruits every year.

That’s call strawman. You’re putting forward stuff don’t agree ask defend it. can’t defend less soldiers already surplus.

And I’m done, you’re going keep going circles won’t answer false dichotomy loaded strawman questions. Man, year city had, dont understand even possibility Ted Wheeler run reelection. Many officials shit bed 2020 stands alone. 66.7 full shit lying themselves. absolutely stunned lack compassion fellow countrymen stuck overseas. gross.

Oh.  could also see happening. never know. I’m hoping someone Disney hook credibility comment. Came say thing! Good news! ive never taken flu shot life honestly barely catch colds. im good Haha. I'm trying dispute it, shopping cart place sell whiteys.... Also live sister. upstairs like fucking gentleman. Except countries well aren’t islands, countries poorly islands. feel ends leading slippery slope ""If refuse vaccine can't keep job/go someplace/etc."" Love analogy. sums perfectly. country locked year, costs 350k quality years life. people die, mean cost life. Every single person gave year cost real year coming back. like plot one James Franco Seth Rogen comedies. Well, presumably bit complicated that... I'm sure there's going lots testing dosing, timing, whether replace boost initial formulation, etc. Also, going hard sell grants extra 5-10% protection mild disease knocks badly second shot does. fine high enough. Covid positive, knew jeopardized every single life plane. us depressed after. title bit misleading. gonna depressed anyway. Australia NZ cut borders rest world pretty much immediately still closed till day that's one reasons lockdown extremely successful course much stricter. give example Melbourne Australia pretty bad covid prevented rhe rest Australia suffering well closing interstate travel putting Melbourne hard lockdown meant cases escape Melbourne. 

I think current rabdom pop new cases cases escaping mandatory hotel quarantine anyone coming country. Whilst new arrivals isolated general public still interactions hotel staff border officers airport etc. course small chance end covid cases escaping  Feeling gratitude seeing comment. wish way collective share gratitude intentions. Thank  testing regimes vaccines different efficacy figures directly comparable. AZ trial PCR tested trial participants regularly. Pfizer trial PCRed people reported symptoms. disease third cases asymptomatic that's big difference.

The best vaccine one already got arm. UK stopped saying can't get worse, always seems understand concern think disproven virus contagious via surface transmission. found love life covid, I'm depressed still realized work lonely even covid, way am. fucking sucks. 1 3 adults *admit to* depressed anxious. issue undermining trust science population current, populist government. Last fall, country seen thousands deaths worst death rate since WWII, medias full articles Covid flu cold issues overblown. even brought various celebrities cause spread disinformation minimized danger. week various people dispute, ridicule, ignore worst health disaster since 1945. Czech statistics clearly placed death toll matching worst weeks WWII fighting Czech territory (Czech demographics reconstructed back 1869) due Covid, message fell deaf ears government population. point unstoppable. checked county data Covid already whipped 0.25-0.33% population since October. non-existing vaccination plan, country see thousands tens thousands deaths summer. main critic government predicted 40,000 deaths summer. think anyone cares? Nope. Mind you, Disney woke AF Boo, hope you’re wrong. Thanks insight. It’s like reddit votes. one guy downvoted -1, start getting downvoted hell. delete repost comment, see start get upvotes. people suggested Disney World could go maskless early coming summer. However, definitely going case; could see extending mask requirements next year. money pay saying businesses US employees stayed afloat well pandemic? US one lost insurance due losing employment start pandemic? know they've fewer cases deaths per capita?

If talking cumulatively measure saying situation better even worse?  small group people able certain vaccines due number reasons- allergies, organ transplants, severely immunocompromised. almost everyone take vaccine so, creates bubble around people cannot- called ‘herd immunity’. virus can’t keep spreading person person hits wall vaccinated people. 

Now people unwilling vaccinate, people (who would love able take one it’s risky health) aren’t protected. virus keeps jumping gaps wall, antivaxxer groups, people don’t want it. That’s it’s important many people possible get vaccinated, point become forced to. understand people wary vaccine, it’s like thrown together year. It’s researched long time, developed adapted product now. 

I even agree they’re nervous, able wait months see it’s affecting friends family get it, pass vaccine someone wants right now. need take eventually.

Vaccines mandatory. Governments various ways- lose job, lose benefits, get fined, go jail. necessity public health. “talking ethics” led saying military shouldn’t recruit children. led reasonable follow-up “well, decreases numbers - that?” managed dance around probably dozens comments. didn’t want discuss that, shouldn’t replied post. That’s all. Covid tho? Antivaxers would put shame.

Especially Dante Maravillas antivaxxers. put phone minute. think that. Keep mind government's best interest healthy population sick people possible, keep healthcare system intact also keep populace healthy due moral economic reasons. kids pre-school open March 2020 graduation end May.

Then sent Summer Camp 100s kids.

No masks required.

Then August 2020 hit sudden mask required public elementary school.

Many parents upset.

Our superintendent quit school year started. Costs minimum 330 million quality years life lockdown US year. Seems like low number Un.fucking.real. Keep us posted.  read could laugh.
This need, bahahaha  mean dissed everyone 2nd populous city u.s. basically monster. wish could read hysterical responses without immediately falling hole conspiracies nonsense. 

Because definitely tinge paranoia this. Twitter even worse. Charlotte right border lot people York lancaster counties South Carolina work Charlotte get healthcare Charlotte. vaccines work people keep spreading disease let mutate vaccinations finished Astrazeneca/Oxford export bans main factory UK leaving India major supplier. Honestly vaccinating people likely exposed first - particular people likely transmission sources. Grocery store workers, medical staff, teachers, pilots flight, attendants, bus drivers, etc. Get people going close contact others first slow spread, high risk people (some may elderly).  Without masks? Unlikely. Disney announced they’re keeping park reservation system 2023, suggests least measures kept longer others. could see masks staying throughout year bring back live entertainment continue increase capacity. student nurse I've volunteered start vaccinating people week. Every little bit helps! Gamaleya Sinovac, China &amp; Russian based vaccines deliver developing countries. would solve problem. Amazon even care mixing fraudulent stock stock. business selling anything everything. Google business ads. helping sell masks real negative consequences grand scheme. know, wonder there's truth that. US... Maybe stopped offering false hopes constantly move goal posts, focus taking care us rid COVID sad. Maybe done something year ago it'd different.

They media latch try reopen sooner. make last longer. Thats possible, numbers I'm quoting checked week ago, point still signifcantly lower promised government officials, ""experts,"" companies, journalists probably pull head ass. Pfizer Moderna pace? argument you’re arguing disingenuously, directly ignoring valid questions

Well disagree valid question is. Since I’m talking ethics neither asked single question ethics.

Your first comment basically “that’s really strategy.” clearly stated I’m talking strategy. kept going going, never talking original comment was. 


But thanks admitting doing. tested preventing symptomatic cases. stood reason would reduce chance vaccinated person carrying-infecting others, never science behind it. Counting deaths way say increase deaths covid pretty tough conclusion prove based data.

First 4 weeks 2019 - 230,000

First 4 weeks 2020 - 238,000

Next 4 2019 - 232,000

Next 4 2020 - 235,000

Next 5 2019 - 288,000

Next 5 2020 - 299,000

There already deaths comparing period period covid widespread. First mask, wear mask, this, nevermind instead, it’s two masks, tomorrow probably 3 masks 1 shot. First we’ll plenty shots April (well age groups occupations eligible) forgo second dose might true. 

Do see general public fatigued frustrated? 

This absolutely terrible messaging worse leadership. doctor anything can't really say covid impact efficiency vaccine byt I'd say probably not. looks like first dose already gives significant amount immunity could well affected since immunity already. Although I'd still isolate room mates tge second dose enough time give extra protection I'm depressed along working throughout covid like one believes me.

""But everyone rough now!""

I've continuously rough years. Also that's terrible excuse depression important. ask?  think it’s also likely 3 times number people actually Covid (or more). Helps continue create buffers stop spread. Everything's ok sleeping. r/LPT don’t. Retail pharmacies capacity 100M month today. think many pharmacies around you. Including markets Costco Walmart Lol hilarious mean U.S. pushing conspiracy China scientists found origin likely China U.S. smeared scientists ignored scientific findings continues push conspiracy China process stoking racism Asian Americans. U.S. hiding something? Trying hard discredit science. Hey I'm sorry hear financial situation, wishing good health new job soon. Covid Tracker Update: 1,100. 7 day average cases nearly 5,000. 7 day average deaths 178. Read ""2 women 20s deceased"" first wondered good news. wish invisible, least wouldn’t miss much. Yup, join club think want start vaxxing 3-4 million people per day need mass vax sites like stadiums/gyms. That’s drug companies making booster shots. People aren’t going hide home forever. tell people can’t go getting vaccinated, choose get vaccine. personal feeling I’ll comfortable related hospitalizations, cases. one hospital anymore, think open up. COVID never put anyone hospital beginning, nothing ever closes wife teacher last checked gotten shot Take easy next day getting it. arm became super sore day after.  they're expecting lot doses May July...and right we're averaging 1.7 million per day. doses available today, would take least June get used, available today. 5 weeks. Back people genuinely terrified. Nobody called. Kept couple guys emergency services (no heat, leaks). Summer busy around Christmas. Last couple weeks unbelievably dead though info, mentions US trial Inc., privately-held immunotherapy company, today announced received authorization South Africa Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) begin Phase clinical trial hAd5 T-cell vaccine, company’s novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate, administered subcutaneously. vaccine currently tested similar Phase trial U.S., safety concerns identified date. goal creating longer-term protection virus, hAd5-COVID-19 targets mutation-prone outer spike protein (S) stable inner nucleocapsid (N) protein, activating antibodies, memory B cells, T-cells coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).

edited: found US trial best population-wide estimate ifr Covid-19 I've seen \~0.6%. saying already substantial immunity (I've seen 25% bandied population death 0.15% certainly suggests that), gonna high. is, best! Also always open suggestions suggestions improve DD thread :) We're currently making changes hopefully help. check mail too! person immune compromised another health issue makes COVID likely fatal?

Yep given already received vaccine dose, assumed either elderly kind health condition. (Turned asthma.) places (at least NJ) scheduling dedicating second shot schedule. Can’t speak states digging read CDC says unavoidable could wait like six weeks doses don’t know enough viruses know analogy works. don’t either. Trying stay sober hard right now. people addiction even slightest mental illness, boredom absolute worst enemy. 

We take away things cause relapse abundant last year. 

With many people stuck inside right now, hard get bored. Whether working not. Poor rich. unable see family, friends, go fun, causing lot people relapse even overdose die. 

Were watch another wave addiction sweep country yet again. Well said!

I guess frustration comes Pfizer rebate price all, since cost more. end day doses world = lives saved. difficult argue that's bad thing overall.  Yh it'll really depend fast covid mutates quick we're able get poorer countries vaccinated. majority world hwd got access vaccines hopefully slow mutations post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Parents want children back school fed stance unions. Good luck future school bond measures passed this. Great article, thanks sharing! it’s extremely common. People idiotic. enough vaccine get retail pharmacies would far best distribution strategy hope goes well! 2009 team flew PAX Prime staff booth. 

9 us went; 7 us (including me) came home H1N1. :| I'm limbo tired enough sleep, tired anything productive.

Not fun deaths U.S. would also suggest much broader immunity recognized. 1 600 Americans died Covid-19, translates population fatality rate 0.15%. Covid-19 infection fatality rate 0.23%. numbers indicate roughly two-thirds U.S. population infection.

How sound logic? Fauci change mind every 3 days. whole pandemic thing really months huh 🌝 
 
 🚀 Quickest we've ever vaccine. mean reason people thought would nearly impossible get vaccine quick back March usually vaccine development takes years. Infact quick Google search apparently quickest time develop vaccine 4 years. fact pfizer/moderna we've mever even approved mRNA vaccine before. there's one good thing come covid quick we've able develop vaccines. Apparently designed Moderna vaccine weekend incredible. gotten flu shot pharmacy every single year adult life, there's usually pharmacist pharmacy tech full-time qualified professional administers it. Staffing never problem. mother law bf got first shot last week. I'm hoping gf get sooner rather later work retail worked people got it. deaths thankfully. Maybe that's true, sense get public health messengers. difficult say average person takes it, think remotely close mask situation. “there reason suspect do, don’t direct evidence therefore best vaccinated people err side caution now”. 

Fauchi said almost verbatim probably hundreds times point. Thanks, useful advice. know must lot work moderate active subreddit contentious topic lot people's nerves frayed. I'm glad option, really financially possible family. Covid 19...? That's 2020 Right? Typically people go pharmacies lots vaccinations including flu pneumonia vaccine MN.

Is common? 1 3 adults pussies. feel like...I don’t want get first shot without guaranteeing able get second one timely manner? anyone anything say this?  like consequences that? every excess death attributable covid. Looking excess deaths benchmark predict many people died covid dumb. Current J&amp;J results single dose. possible two dose trials might give comparable results. they're not. Stop it. liberals. go figure see phases goes age like that?  first time year I’m happy 46. stands reason get run elephant today, official studies so... Nope. soon vaccines widely available anyone wants them, I’m done masks. probably turned grew rate UK. really sequencing recently Florida using pharmacies distribute vaccine. got second shot today Publix. use invisibility good evil? Sure, it’s really stretching tie back original premise recall government saying COVID would disappear election. infrastructure large scale vaccination already exists PCP offices, literally already staffing there. Pharmacists already overworked basically hired bunch temp workers could cash federal vaccine dollars. I'm saying ""Have"" PCP, use offices distribution pick one closeby. Makes sense creating setup temp workers disappear months, encourages people visit doctor, important given lack preventative care country. Much messaging interpreted average person “vaccines don’t prevent transmission” rather “there reason suspect do, don’t direct evidence therefore best vaccinated people err side caution now”. 

I bunch friends said getting vaccine pointless young healthy doesn’t prevent transmission anyway, it’s like cautious harmless. 

I think it’s similar situation masks year ago. lack direct evidence masks anything prevent transmission particular virus led people recommend people remain skeptical even great studies proved really help. I'm halfway expecting people open trucks masks government supposed deliver year ago. They're like hey guys it! We're distributing masks!!!!! Vaccines 100% effective people able vaccinated due legitimate medical reasons. Tricites Va.
And I'm wary it. I've seen 3 people live fine. 88yo woman, guy mid twenties, older gentleman 50's. acting like common cold. Idk man. I'm indifferent.

My favorite thing nowadays, complaining many white people vaccinated. mean really 😑   2 3 adults lying feeling depressed anxious due covid-19 help people stay safe.

Yes, loose fitting piece regular cloth massive air gaps great filter virus. never science behind it.

The household secondary attack rate asymptomatic cases dramatically lower symptomatic presymptomatic quite ""proving water wet"" would extremely surprising vaccines prevent symptomatic cases decrease transmission. Holy fuck enough everyone related:

**Novavax testing new version COVID-19 vaccine specifically target 

**CureVac UK Government collaborate development vaccines SARS-CoV-2  Where's significant evidence COVID came Chinese lab, Pompeo? nearly year. Republic China... completely independent separate country People's Republic China. shits entire foundational premise up. Vaccines confer different degrees sterilizing immunity effective immunity. former prevents infection latter prevents disease may still lead asymptomatic spread. benevolent overlords take away warning votes. Totally interest see anyone would disagree.  I’ve never seen anyone works grocery store isn’t shelf stocker.

What kind store shop at, eh? Yea like Publix flu vaccine...they give 10$ gift card.  im pharmacist small two person pharmacy ready able provide 1500/day ourselves. Moderna? them, since stored normal temps longer periods. Pfizer, less so, neither Publix pharmacies here, they're given Moderna. J&amp;J distributable anywhere already vaccines. It’s definitely USA exporting. Canada way behind suppliers. 
But, bright side, it’s small country, wouldn’t surprised see situation quickly turn around months global vaccine surge really comes online. There’ll even point USA soon vaccine adult demand. Wouldn’t surprised start exporting sooner later don’t wait Europe. also love kyuss, suggested first. Even US, J&amp;J would major boost allow doctor's offices pharmacies around country, offering effective vaccine right spot wait need follow up. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

If anyone struggling needs someone talk happy chat. one read 'compromised' first time around? 
2020 turned default pessimist ☹️ Sturgeon gotten wanted, independent scotland part eu, Scotland would much worse off. EU’s vaccine programme is, thus far, going terribly.

Is watchdog/committee overseeing issues like this? Exactly. Something better nothing! Delete post please data wrong China provides less funding Bill Gates. Taiwan issue funding, geopolitics. Membership WHA (WHO's decision making assembly) purview assembly itself. Taiwan/China issue seen every international organization, particularly assemblies members deciding membership. Continue wearing mask  possible use UK's delaying protocol test effectiveness strategy? Well.. theres change management since then. Trump's goal 100M end 2020 (based science, something pulled ass), 40M 20M managed 2.1M. failed miserably course time New Year Biden's inauguration Trump doubled ~4M. Meanwhile 1 month taking office daily amount track blow away Biden's goal 100M 100 days, we're already 60M. barring issues may occur along way we're looking 6 months everyone get first dose nothing changes all, we're likely least double speed within next month according article.

Reminding people keep talking too. reminder keep talking economic pain pain Covid. Assuming absolute massive underreporting deaths, somehow people decided share economic pains covid. 

Also want remind never said anything perfectly trucks carrying dead city? frequent reports Hospitals overrun across India? 

A reminder happens massive plenty sources detailing stuff happening one city prove generalisation entire country. Fantastic. intelligent.

All received billions development preparatory works manufacturing distribution. August 2020, eight companies chosen funding $11 billion expedite development preparation manufacturing respective vaccine  surely aware first virus we've encountered right?

And previous vaccines demonstrated ability reduce transmission varying degrees

We also know asymptomatic covid patients less effective spreaders.

So vaccine reduces symptomatic infection 90% almost certainly effect transmission That's they're saying. MPB gets severe age, affects people genetically predisposed.

Amazing brainwashing people. non dominant arm Based past 12 months, here's what's going happen Merkel: Hey... so… know took us little bit long vaccinate finally it. Unfortunately, it’s looking like vaccine gave doesn’t really work new variants. good news: There’s booster available we’ve already convinced Poland Hungary isn’t conspiracy turn gay. bad news: choice extend ‘Lockdown Light’ everyone gets booster.  Germans: Wow really sucks guess [no one could ever seen Anyway we’ve already lockdown 52 months, what’s one more? special line something use make booster appointment?

And scene. Waiting get means going scientific reccomendatkons reduce getting covid importantly, spreading Waiting preferred vaccine anti science prolonging suffering I’m sure skeptics pro lockdown yet ones willing keep spreading it

What bunch stupid nonsense. really gasping arguments here.

There peer reviewed studio find best outcome personally is. Like all. scientific knowledge simply says one vaccine 60% effective others way 90%, logically get one effective top less health risks. 

I sure could find recommendation scientist Germany recommend citizens, would based best whole population based economics much health concerns. 

And even doubt scientist would recommend people outside risk groups get vaccinated weaker product everybody within risks groups get AZ vaccine vaccinated.  2 3 *aren't?!?!?* Despite read Toronto Sun, Canada massive vaccine winner compared rest world. developing world getting unbelievably screwed vaccine nationalism take literally years vaccinate current rate, meanwhile we’re sweating April vs June. wealthy person country

It still concern vaccine stop transmission Covid vaccinated individuals non-vaccinated individuals. concern even greater newer strains set become dominant ones USA.

Of course great production rate increasing. would think maybe Trump administration could used Defense Production Act factories ready roll vaccines approved. course would required competency work ethic forms human qualities.

But are, day late dollar short comes vaccines school systems across country.

If believe Andrew Cuomo held accountable bad decisions cost lives nursing homes believe presidential administrations held account forcing people back work without adequate vaccine protection families. thing. Unenforced laws exist. Well get happy yet. Takes upwards 2 weeks fully protected could rough days ahead. Hopefully minor knowing least way almost fully protected awesome.

Plenty news outlets constantly reporting government. again.

That's funny. Denying independent review journalists without borders agree beliefs? crack up, funny. absolutely deluded. Maybe they're concerned child getting proper education protecting exposure. people young children elderly. dunno increasing reports single shot almost effective two. Covid misinformation cause harm. important job taking heavy handed approach shut misinformation sub. didn’t it, reddit would close place down. crazy. people protest right vaccinated.

Jokes you, I'm even depressed somebody else made joke me. humor hides pain ha ha...:-( Yea bad clickbait tittle. Yep. least one still hope could quickly. know governments let thing go population completely broken obedient. know exact date got vaccinated say December 24th, 2 weeks January 7th would personally consider early January. got big delivery, let’s wait see efficient provinces getting shots arms go begging doses. also little nuanced that. usually separate numbers protection mild/moderate illness, severe illness hospitalization, death. rather report 3 separate numbers, average together, kind frustrating. like vaccine might 70% effective mild illness, 90% serious illness 100% death report ""94%"" something. people care serious outcomes.

Also sometime numbers reported span time like 25 days shot. may 0% effectiveness 1 day 90% effectiveness 25 days reported average 50%. one explanation this.

To nonsense, like saying, team 0 points start game 24 points end game scored average 12 points. people care final simple way look it. I’m vaccinated obviously still can’t go concerts, full events, etc life back normal. 

But feel much safer stores/at work/going dinner etc? Yes sure. linked press release English, need read automatic translation. available German also. It’s quite spring yet. Peak coronavirus season usually March. third coronavirus outbreak 20 years. known SARS-like coronaviruses bats transmitted people either directly intermediate animals. evidence anything else. likely market Wuhan super spreading event, may originated earlier. Anything else propaganda evidence. There’s millions times greater risk dying get COVID vaccine. Don’t ridiculous. see one people favor mask nonsense self esteem issues thus enjoy able hide face public. people feel way. Swedens numbers clearly show abnormally large jump mortality 2020 burden proof claiming otherwise. I've already provided data ""easily explained"" wrongful attributed covid deaths HIGHEST MORTALITY YEAR THEY'VE EVER HAD. killing them? 

EVERY country faking death numbers, covid numbers... basically saying here.

Back claims surprised people call misinformation teach using KN95s school year. found fair amount test videos youtube made feel confident determining whether mask fake. burn tests, aerosol tests water tests do. state’s power failure plunged hospitals crisis, even still reeling coronavirus pandemic. people get is:

- isn’t strict screening behind registrations

- People want vaccines going get them, that’s bad thing. realizing they’re wrong unbanning them. unlikely be. general, viruses become contagious become *less* deadly. Bloomberg link bookmarked, bookmark remembers headline first bookmarked says ""More 3.5 Million Shots Given"". Today headline ""More 193 Million Shots Given"" :). *Times* found alarmism like??? I’m allowed get vaccine (which won’t Spring), I’m going go back living life normally. Good. really dangerous give much power government, lot consequences. let happen again. Hard pass second hand oats.  Honestly think ending now. think sudden decline cases shows virus largely run source. declining areas even vaccines. people vaccinated think put nail coffin. It’s really unfortunate idea taken hold. serious risk single dose vaccines allow disease quickly evolve response limited vs durable immunity, rendering vaccines Source? sounds reasonable. feel like concerts stuff summer done, big season performers would important recover, also warm outside know covid barely spreads outside, let alone warm weather. imagine resistance crumbled watched people get vaccine issues. Beware ides March? Oh care stuff amirite?...psshhh year old dying whocare? AZ single-dose.

Also think extending interval 12 weeks like we're UK definitely best. Drives mad people say there's evidence anything everything know vaccines Covid suggests delay jags better! (And Pfizer Moderna likely 4 week gaps get testing done quickly possible.) I’m arguing outbreak started China, could say October. another way estimating number people infected virus try estimate herd exposure/immunity.

Throughout pandemic reports 5, 6, 10, even 20 times many infections cases. people get never get sick get mildly sick tested go doctor.

If say 5x, 28.5 million cases US would 142 million infections 43% population. Add 10-15% vaccinated we're 50% would explain sudden decline cases past weeks. No. current needles extract liquid problem. It’s needles aren’t long enough reach bottom.

The problem dead volume loss needles syringe. lose liquid every time withdraw dose. Nice strawman wish country Germanys infection rate. :-/ point, numbers low enough (and they’re getting super fast) people need move on. I’m losing another summer, know schools gonna keep masks rest school year, I’ve already trying friends much possible help mental health. gets warmer, move Hey mods... time shut subreddit mouthpiece Covid truthers trying push propaganda. almost bad post-GME WSB. Yeah I'm idiot, let guess, whole sweden idiots well they're banning masks? Get grip article English new vaccine efficacy data Israel? longer needles make worse? longer needles would able bottom vial extract last doses, no? Actually seen 0.23-0.27% published times.

[Across 51 locations,
the median COVID-19 infection fatality rate 0.27% (corrected overall noninstitutionalized IFR IFR steadily dropping throughout pandemic part reasons say, basically first every ""case"" someone seriously ill got testing awareness far cases.

I think people starting realize every ""case"" probably 3-5 infections tracked all. example [Gottlieb thought 30% population infected end would drive IFR even lower, would also put us close herd immunity. Again, harm good, hence sweden starting ban mention millions US jobs depend exports countries covid depressed economies. Longer needle make worse, even dead volume. says Pfizer manual combine vials, there’s risk contamination transfer vaccine one vial another. thing second half tho mate, don’t agree.. kinda funny right, damaging I'm really glad people understanding that. can't let heavy handed type thing happen again, cost simply great. I’ll take vaccine prevents getting sick. Yes definitely Fully agree boy Ben uncomfortable af, harmful anyway physical health it? Yes. it? I'm sure... course you’ll able to. info we’ve seen shows vaccine fully kicks week two second dose, still provides immunity first dose even even safer before. Try let Covid anxiety get you, get vaccine you’ve done part. Yup first shot felt nothing. I’ve heard second one one people getting reaction I’m 16 hours second still nothing  Yup, I'm one needs help see variants They’re pretty decent tend rely incivility rule much. use blanket anything don’t like. 

Also get little power trippy every while. removed one post two months ago. messaged ask exactly wrong. met muted temp banned 3 5 days, don’t remember which. Sweden starting ban useless actually harmful are, harm good protects almost 0 virus makes harder breathe think you’d fine whatever want vaccine

TBH, future, mind wearing surgical mask crowded spaces (bus/trains/crowded markets, etc) regardless may still annoying restrictions.

I continue follow rules. feel this. friends group (and family, really) I'm one able get one. Everyone found magic connection whether school work unnamed clinics happening me. ""find new hobbies yourself"" 

That advice last April. Whenever see words ""ruthless"" ""leverage"" hear alarm bells--and see people talking leveraging proletariat, sends ""red flag,"" ha ha ha. 

I'm favor ""ruthless"" organizations politics kind, know always end. exactly opposite ruthlessness would like see inculcated elite. lot already there--Gates, Buffett--and may come pike. Bernie Sanders set forth exactly could achieved zero cost rich, enough keep country busy decade. feel like it, cause did. confint (1.004-1.972) p value 0.0468, Exactly. Let people take risks willing to, reason force things. risk really people danger covid know anyway. yes USA stop funding WHO, hid seriousness virus let China take charge finding originated. basically let China hide things expense world's population keep money flowing China. darn shame USA funding WHO. make needles longer? combine vials make easier get last doses? seems like huge oversight people design vials people design syringes. This, Daily Beast article article definitely worth read thinking about: another NYT briefing last week titled ""Covid really important rethink messaging public conversations safely socialize vaccinate population come winter. curious decided blown disc blessing? 

Speaking someone bulging disc limits much walk time time long comfortably stand, I'm sure see blessing. What? see difference knowing covid still boarding flight vs knowing covid accidentally infecting someone, may room temperature IQ I'm sure source claim Medically think you’d fine whatever want vaccine! Socially may still annoying restrictions. Focused protection? Give people options depending health? fact we're rolling vaccines, spring coming covid seasonal virus? Totally agree, pejorative connotation. originated 1952 cold war, first world countries us western european countries, second world communist countries third world countries colonized recently got Independence. certainly meant third world countries economically inferior also culturally socially. I'm always suprised still hear now. Pascal Blanchard ( one favorite historians ) said colonization long gone cultural colonization meaning mentality collective subconsciousness still different well oriented way see others. hate terms like ""westerners"" ""easterners"" ""the west"" ""the east"" ""third world countries"" .... moroccan dialect ""Lguwer"" ""nssara"" . longer use terms. citizens world. close zero population immunity seasonal virus act different. 

Seasonality reduces ability spread eliminate it. Normally things like flu decent fraction people immunity Rt falls 1 sometime later winter. 

But new virus introduced even impact seasonality may enough overcome 0-10% population immunity. Protection starts 12 14 days first dose say bad not. body could still needs bad feel ill afterwards. sore arm 24hrs felt since getting 1st shot last Sunday. amazing, like bubble popping.

What looks like something driving spread (and lack spread) virus nothing holidays, masks, lockdowns, etc. Like California severe lockdowns late last year virus went spread anyway, everyone worried holidays making worse cases actually peaked Christmas declining ever since.

I personally think virus spreading nearly unchecked areas half-assed lockdown really lockdown all. seeing exponential spread virus gone year finally dropping approaching herd immunity. wailing gnashing teeth masks lockdowns socially distancing largely meaningless. Maybe partially, covid seasonal virus we're heading towards spring starting take effect. Except reports February-December (leaving people infected January, cases worse month besides December).

At least 100 million Americans likely COVID now, scientists estimating 50% acquired immunity natural being, lockdowns stop COVID. destroyed society nothing. weekend away house thing. pharmacies? That’s basically place get here. Publix, Walmart, Winn-Dixie, Sam’s Club them. Walmart busy giving shots got first dose morning. Due massive grade inflation remote schooling might screwed getting accepted economics program school. accept top 250 applicants, grade cutoff get around 75-77%. end term I’ll likely around 77%, due grade inflation might get in. Last year, transition March, people 77.8% averages didn’t get in. 

I’m really frustrated might get something I’ve wanted achieve long fucking virus, year I’d get in. Fuck student covid. Hence environment fully fucked. least county almost appointments mega sites (we 4) cancelled (as yesterday) earliest next Tuesday that’s maybe. vaccines couldn’t get produced shipped due weather issues across country. numbers week garbage.  I'm sorry hear this. Hang there. Show us findings? I’d like see different sources backing argument making. Different ones around world. source? gotta make sure give babies /s Sorry tax reading paragraphs. overly reductive break complex issues ""REMOTE SCHOOL BAD, OPEN SCHOOL ASAP GOOD"" guess that's level discourse people willing continuing pandemic.

I'd rather get COVID every year continue able favorite things (travel music festivals/concerts). No, vaccines effective J&amp;J already. seems undeniable variants escape J&amp;J quickly Pfizer/Moderna. definitely shorter window protection (from vaccination variants escape vaccine), good reduces transmission thus rate mutation.

Plus, people reject masks flu season COVID ends. Covid think autocorrected “assholes” “amazing”. don’t want give click. 

Did reporting, know, like looking testing numbers trends? think big prevention severe diseases, transmission rate.

The sample size small anyone claim vaccine provides x% transmission virus. article also stated interpreting better, understand people, even vaccinated, [have possibility contracting disease able transmit , reports provider.   expert, data show vaccine protects serious symptoms disease, reducing viral load. However, possibility virus continue transmitted, something requires maintenance safety hygiene care.

Book. get state done 2 mos. Pfizer announced regular cold storage Thoughts double masking? science seems suggest win-win scenario mask wearers anti-makers.

According epidemiologist, double mask (surgical mask cloth mask) virtually level protection mantra mask mandates? ""You right chose, wearing mask protect you, protects others!"".

But article double masking true, masking become legitimate person choice now? Anyone worried catching virus double mask, anyone worried (or want wear mask whatever reason) wear mask all. significant risk wear double mask, risk infections gets placed chose wear one. Hypothetically, given choice, right now, either infected covid living another year like past one, would choose?

Personally, would take covid sure. week two feeling shitty plus small risk serious complications much better full year devoid anything makes life worth living. haven’t seen hard evidence virus decreases chance getting again. fact know Doctors personally multiple times, symptoms reported worse second third infections. That's right. better people power somehow really strict gov control.

However, colleges may opt keep things way are.

I don’t think colleges restriction free next Spring semester earliest. media. European politicians. Specifically macron. don’t get anything less 100% would acceptable? staff students long vaccinated. goalposts. never “safe enough.”  Maybe one second first dose resistance still zero. article says, 15 28 *first shot*, vaccine 85% effective.

Yeah, I've feeling kinda blue last months. second dose extremely important. 

That extra percentage two doses make threshold much lower might make achievable without antivaxxers. Also evidence shown second dose key long term memory cell immunity. great news. that, 66% Pfizer. AZ made headlines Pfizer vaccine plugging away need PR campaign, otherwise demand vaccine going start getting soft.

You tell people fight lines online problems wait weeks get vaccine, tell might help, allow get lockdown, help stopping spread, kids still can't go school, can't go public places, etc. many wonder take it. Even young healthy people died covid. see huge risk avoided matter cost is. read Portuguese relying comments said first 11 residents it, number jumped 17; also adding two test populations together get 355. may correct, posters say. vaccinating that's doing. 95% deaths 65% hospitalizations 55+ year old population. fully expect back working months chance get vaccine deaths hospitalizations fallen cliff due vaccinating elderly. First dose - give everyone sort general immunity COVID-19, ASAP

Second dose - booster shot new variants sometime fall. give earlier risk populations first two weeks likely offer little immunity studied 15-28 days post first dose understanding going vaccinate people second dose going wait way get longer set data.

Wow. say it’s “trend?” Oh wait, *I didn’t.*

I said several times (and repeated it) they’re ticking up. Ticking = small measure.  Yet another article illustrating massive Canadian blunders w/Covid vaccines - written non-Canadian media outlets (CNN + NY Times). Unfortunately Canada rely international press get word horribly leader failed vaccine procurement. false claims attacks targeted vaccine within Europe. UK uptake amazing far - vaccine completely different perceptions. Anyone listens experts knows approved vaccines pretty much job think guess right. video available everyone see. I? no. happen? yes. suggest read bribes China. Wait R number 1 mean then? problem science media tangled together. professional deals data making definitive statements overwhelming evidence gets asked answer question, gives statement like ""We know yet."" ""It may may not"", media runs ""COVID transmission still might possible despite vaccine"" headlines.

On surface headline actually *known* false, framing *very* negative need dive deep actual statements data come understand reality. know rest US, Chicago outdoor mask wearing like 99%.  UW - Madison Wisconsin saying want 75% courses completely person fall. isnt. still carry transmit virus others yet vaccinated. root cause US federal government highly inefficient. lot reasons this, biggest accountability low rates turnover amongst federal workers creating lack diverse thought competence.

I'd rather go another year like last one, assuming hypothetical scenario getting COVID prevent thousands/millions deaths. 

Although I'm risk group COVID I'm concerned possible long-term health impacts virus (lung/heart/brain damage). Well we’re 10 days away March people consider “Dark Winter” over. 

I’m hoping top media coverage calms head March temperatures go up/snow melts. Instituting vaccine passports point prior vaccines available everyone discriminating people they're healthy young. bribe Chinese officials *from Ohio* sounds real believable. Yes, made moronic comment. Enjoy learn it. would prefer overly simplistic polarizing labels like ""anti mask"".

Wanting policy makers strike balance help mitigate negative consequences lockdowns like mental health, education, jobs, business, etc. also controlling spread virus fit label want. like removed posting politics. plenty subreddits post political views. problem. virologist anything, recent science, best understand it.

As data comes out, numbers might change even more, that's good thing! Means they're getting accurate. Wow. I’m pretty optimistic immediate future regards ending pandemic, think tad optimistic. hope I’m wrong though. Lmfaoooo. fucking kidding me? I'll take 10 cases Covid. I'm done bullshit. one wants elected official says grocery store workers get vaccine firemen whatever. They'd lose support firefighter's unions. Grocery store workers individual people unionized, go bottom list. 

Hilariously, can't even bring number waves telling someone they're wave 2 unpopular. Instead, everyone falls waves 1a, 1b, 1c. forget subgroups within waves, especially wave 1b, divided something like 10 categories.

Like, mean? Spring summer last months different different areas.

There also difference vaccine becomes available, everyone wants it. Could weeks months, depends many people actually take it, much TBD. Hahaha deal Chinese factories daily don’t think information compelling enough throwaway clinical trial data. Monitoring cases two weeks sufficient. Behavior amongst vaccinated could likely play big role makes question compared clinical trials monitored post vaccination using placebo arm. top sample size large. Biden says we’re least ten months this, I’m guessing lot schools gonna keep public health measures Christmas they’ll evaluate January March 2022 return normal. Albuterol (and derivatives) probably helps affected covid, I'm guessing regular meds help prevent covid catching/entering first place. mostly gone April.......2026 No, take away travel contact, transmission virus. matter season is. Look happened NYC last Spring Summer. issue season, unprotected contact. recent news Pfizer first dose storage methods affect vaccine distribution social end pandemic? Yeah also curious this. Read papers said main goal vaccine prevent/reduce severe cases, actually give 100% immunity virus. Say catch virus even vaccinated, help decreasing serious hits you? store hundreds millions doses? Probably lot. Pfizer probably made money selling freezers actual vaccines. Again, based combination decades experience vaccines work, hard data now. want dismiss data weak justify policy. problem safe, conservative option seem think is. knew sure depriving people first dose (in favour giving people second dose) would definitely lead people dying. Given data circumstances, wrong choice. Canadian government came ""expert modelling"" today telling everyone even already excruciating measures, may even enough combat variants + third wave. 

Whats frustrating government responded correctly, would good vaccine rollout. 

At point Canadians looking another lost spring/socially distant summer USA,UK, etc, moving on.

It sucks Agreed. would keep everyone safe massive case spikes we'll seeing super bowl.

I'm full crow I'm eating here. it? past month, I've seen lot insightful comments daily thread various places Internet. One really stands me, I'll paraphrase:

If ask barber need haircut, course he's almost certainly going say, 'yes!'

If ask Fauci similar public health authority whether safe stop wearing masks, attend concerts, gather family, etc...well, there's good chance going give green light, EVER. entire freakin' job study infectious disease prevent spread, likely never going okay things. Ask yourself, Fauci ever really okay indoor concerts conferences? public health expert basically nice way calling them, ""professional hypochondriacs.""

No disrespect Fauci intended, way, like simply jobs. wonder, point, numbers low enough hospitalizations/deaths low enough say, ""Thanks time service, Doc - we're moving - without you."" mean, public health experts EVER give blessing resume normality numbers anything ZERO? see thing viruses. instance, US cold flu season starts around equator moves north season changes. kind understandable timeline like emerges:

[No indication Covid-19 virus Wuhan December 2019: intelligence warned November 2019 coronavirus spreading China could 'cataclysmic August 2019, oddly accurate simulation novel virus starts spreading central China: [Crimson I'd prefer believing virus originated wild, timeline seem very...confusing.

Sorry, wanted get chest. I've rough go lately. many think got made? I'm glad tax money paying israel free healthcare, wife pay $800/month. original source precisely added praise

Then perhaps original source linked instead. correct form, could added praise comment, editorialising.

Whilst vaccine obviously effective, editorialisation misrepresent article's content bottom line, misinformation, whether good intent not. ever ever ever ever and...

Measure twice, cut once. jobs, want vaccinated return classrooms. 

Your comment assumes don’t want jobs. do. father thinks way. usually runs winter pub crawl small hometown fundraiser, he's like ""Yeah can't imagine happening year (meaning December 2021), know someone end sick know it"". 

It's low-key kind ""zero-covid"" mentality. population-level, like ""Is chance someone might catch covid event?"" unable get mental hurdle **maybe that's fine everyone vaccinated**. I'm confused, comments make sound like posted solely bait people. clearly sub's rules. sub really gone complete 180 degree turn doom gloom everywhere would consider toxic optimism. Incidence matters too. million people active infections Rt spikes 1.3 that's major crisis. 100 people infected Rt spikes number that's barely detectable. 


And transmission rate highly variable things like holidays high incidence bit like playing Russian roulette regardless current transmission rate is. Agreed. easy take granted good relations we've neighbors. Keep bonds strong help can. little doubt case admin. FDA say since evaluated vaccine. data AZ vaccine 12 weeks, data Pfizer. That’s state is, well. everything open, limited capacity. know common reinfections are? Especially involving B117 B1351?  Shit.

We highly effective vaccines risk elderly vaccinated summer. happens needs stop people need decide comfortable with. originated China, can't originated Maryland vice versa. originated lab can't originated wet market. mutually exclusive truths. 

There may inconclusive evidence, there's nothing wrong admitting ""We lack information make final determination"", change fact there's one actual truth. four lights matter blind person says ""Well can't see we'll never sure"". always four lights. really see Americans ok one dose people gotten 2 doses? 1) people greedy want everyone else got, 2) people damn scared virus trying tell 93% effective intents purposes good 95% isn’t gonna matter people. They’re gonna want “full protection”. makes happy. One things Im looking forward going nyc, favorite city world, eating one tiny chaotic italian restaurants barely walk tables practically bumping elbows stranger. seriously can't wait.  fair, neither I, I've never covid, Im shape. combined covid maybe would bring 2m? Europeans really love told allow governments want vaccines use aren’t similar one. I’m sure conclude it’s better spaced apart based this. 

This vaccine never approved US anyway. FDA won’t much use study. risk kids covid extremely low, lower flu. terms deaths, hospitalizations, reopening, etc., make much difference kids vaccinated. PCR tests produce wild false positives anyway non-diagnostic nature. Attempting Count number people objectively sick reporting daily basis bizarre system governance.

Glad don’t live Ireland... geez Would like explain also editorialise headline? quote 'vaccine praised success' ?


This original source story.

The original source precisely added praise, again, precisely make point 11 cases extremely good news, antivaxx scaremongering. question always been, cases, whether protection single dose sustained whether complete enough prevent mutations may reduce vaccine efficacy.

The Pfizer data cite covers single week results - tells nothing value shot three months.

And AZ data cite 12-week interval small subset - less 3000 people - randomly selected representative sample study participants. Dosage interval tested explicitly - simply re-sliced data reanalyzed attempt back-justify UK decision people’s doses delayed due study design changing fly.

Both hints extended dosage strategy might possible, great reasons expeditiously launch studies investigate possibility. data quality sufficient making public health decisions whole population either case without investigation.

This isn’t board game. world makes health decisions based research, hunches guesses clues. Question Palestinians allowed vaccine. Variants horrible news begin with.

The 1918 pandemic influenza vaccinations, infected killed many people, mutations arose achieved immune escape came back infected everyone again. People back called variants ""seasonal used good news stop mainlining variant fever. That’s headline said submitted it. hope age like milk. hope month curdled foul smelling cases hospitalizations death continued precipitous declines mask mandates already way out. people put this? need dig holes parts world nickel, lithium, copper, iron...

Right China world's industries cajones. did, California voluntarily stayed locked down. person asked anyone else kind feeling blue, said no, personally. Also since live UK restrictions apply know things get back normal rather soon US. also wondering person lived noticed tougher restrictions first hand. okay allowed? Holy optimism. would jump that. think “degree normality” crap really doesn’t help things. think makes people wonder wtf  summer US comes back, rest us keep waiting  living relatively normal life achieving covid results states lock downs? epiforecasts Transmission-preventing efficacy potentially higher symptom-preventing efficacy. There's reasonably strong evidence contagiousness dependent viral load. There's also pretty strong evidence spread largely driven small number ""super spreaders"" rather everyone spreading disease little. vaccine significantly depresses viral load would worst cases, could outsized effect depressing effective R0.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit - speculative course. Transmission-prevention could also lower symptom-prevention efficacy, might push herd-immunity reach.

Oh, mean already stare 8 hours day Zoom video calls work. Welp south africa literally asked India refund AZ vaccines started national strategy J J vaccine better data J J vs SA variant.

So that's one big reason There’s really negative coverage side effects. seems overshadowed thoughts effectiveness groups people. Somehow idea it’s used UK month major incidents considered. see another redditor can’t add. 1400 + 600 equals 2000 btw ema base review FDA. Europe much larger market. review.  think assumption (read: OP might able provide actual data chose to) vaccination.

The problem using one example evidence claim 'prevention transmission' easily reversed examples says otherwise.

I high hope Pfizer provides prevention transmission, bring different retirement home example vaccinated residents tested positive two shots Pfizer (all mild symptoms however, said big news protection severe prioritizing frontline workers

That's quite claim wish backed up. I’m sure they’ll take well “You’re self-protected, still could danger people, especially start using behavioral disinhibition, saying, ‘I'm vaccinated, I'm invulnerable’,” Corey says. “You could acquire Covid silent, infect bunch people lucky vaccinated point time.” -Larry Corey, co-director Covid-19 Prevention Network

He works ""Normal"" ?

Everyone different idea normal is. understand Fauci said would still wearing masks, possibly years. Easy Biden. want things resume well let’s get excited. still 50-60 percent people needed vaccinated see good progress towards normality. employer? Please elaborate. people show Frills employee ID's? apply essential workers fast food too? (they've also working whole time).

If someone works smaller lesser known grocery store/pharmacy/take restaurant/any essential retail, qualify verify businesses employment real fit criteria? 

For people medical history suggests give vaccine earlier, actually much easier manage. Doctors offices given vaccine administered patients fit criteria laid out. family doctor would obviously record medical history obviously set able give vaccines. likely still grey area, certainly easier manage ""if work grocery store, get vaccine.""

I'm curious apply grocery store employees consider essential retail employees right earlier access vaccine? hypothesis sometime late March/early April, time 100M people vaccinated deaths/hospitalizations hit time lows, tier system California completely abolished replaced something far less restrictive focuses hospitalizations covid. purely number-based perspective individuals immunity, preposterous keep things closed April purely based cases. expecting major reopening next two months.  

Furthermore I've stoked hear Pfizer Moderna basically *doubling* starting weeks J&amp;J one-shot vaccine approved 26th! end near!! He’s still double masked keeping 20 feet away anyone even though he’s fully vaccinated chances getting COVID dying almost zero. know it’s messaging thing, point needs switch “you vaccine it’s awesome....you’re safe now...enjoy life again”. infectious, please stop taking things lightly. decline cases strict reaction infectious strains. vaccines rolled stricter lockdowns = cases going Please encourage brigading subs. Thanks. Obviously false.

Simple fact nothing significance ever come Maryland

If China knew world hold common knowledge made accusation CDC updated 59.7m doses administered also promised 2000 dollar stimulus checks. Look went. Yeah think you’re right major shipping hubs. looks like Pfizer goes UPS Louisville Moderna fed ex Memphis. southern cities received several inches snow couple different days week. Neither you. guarantee people align perspective every day, moving away cried too! want family meet baby boy! would clots give away? Developing country? Well can’t always want overestimating economics exact science. qualitative many regards. 7 years economics 2 post graduate degrees (2 countries, 2 languages). One thing learned, economic theory often translates poorly real world economics. 2 theories issue come 2 different outcomes recommendations. pick? one vogue now, one mostly applied 20 years ago, one 100 years ago? Decisions often driven ideological agenda. Therefore, one theory hardly ever objectively trump another. news sells economic theory fact, treat scepticism assume likely another theory recommends opposite. Literally got second shot woo!!! COVID me!!! means I’m designated errand runner household 😂😂😂 Personally, agree - seems makes sense keep schools been. enough people badly want schools reopen, teachers small enough slice population (less 1%) seems easier vaccinate done it.

Vaccine shipments going 10% next week, 1.5M/week California. 300k teachers California. means change reduce current supply vaccines groups, take 4 weeks earmark enough vaccines every teacher state. Berkeley thing Blah blah blah. think so. FDA pretty conservative.

There's different types data. randomized control trial far considered gold standard FDA typically follows gold standard. بقات فسبان اداك اللحاس I'm ignoring that's locally dependent. Dakotas versus Vermont Hawaii different numbers. Hawaii would one people right now. South Dakota would 9. 

What's point using national numbers case lol Sorry, dunno details stuff would routed. even sure vaccines given in, say, Spokane would shipped directly they'd go via Sea-Tac Airport (near Seattle) sent state health department Spokane (~280 miles east). assume shipments vaccines given week would delayed something going several days ago, maybe even close week ago.

Since major shipping companies work hub-and-spoke model, maybe stuff Michigan going sent distribution hub airport another state cancel flights day two? vaccines might also unusual restrictions shipped due low-temperature storage requirements.

BTW, idea FedEx's Memphis hub big deal saw video. reason limit 2 zip codes within county. Eligible eligible even outside zip codes. elderly person one zip code travel farther get vaccine? Sir tqawed sir   Probably depends. find physical evidence clots, easier determine. apparent physical cause, I’m sure determining cause much difficult. says determined safe get vaccine, heart problems aren’t always detected tests. stepfather stress test said perfectly fine three months later scheduled quadruple bypass. Nope. Palestinians Oslo accords supposed vaccinated PA Israel... lol
 
Nah, opinions alright! clue. Maybe people don’t like CA? brother's family like this. would let sister visit outside, mask, negative covid test sister kids, let inside use bathroom. They're definitely ""no going there's 0 risk"" types. expect see children also vaccinated. Fuck that. I’m ditching mask soon vaccines widely available, there’s nothing anyone else it. US answer summer sometime. honestly could see early June July mean partial normal mean basically full normal except maybe masks. Even masks think iffy. Pfizer best vaccine world close We've ""hiding"" behind scientific method since formulated. reason that. get hard non scientific people grasp importance even ""logic"" ""common sense"" cannot used substitute. Unfortunately, does. Florida 4 federally run vaccination sites can't pull doses from. likely second dose needed longer-term immunity. best course action might still second doses, spread time. move second dose three months instead \~3 weeks, protect whole lot people amount time. Nah people would prefer one works. vaccine works significantly better ones likely including Moderna. Yep. Also worth noting, FDA didn’t disagree policy, wasn’t data support it.

Now rewriting inconvenient history. Fauci strongly implied ""risky"" wrong decision. need limit 2 zip codes county. zip codes county also senior citizens need vaccinated.

Let's reset. simply true, data Israel disproves this. imagine PARTIES day. CELEBRATING. That's I'm currently living for

Yeah 2022 fun. Good point. got little worked nothing. Thank you. Oh wonder 8 months. Huh...

Maybe test one 4 years too. wait even deadlier infectious mutations two new ones cropped up. want miss arbitrary deadlines, completely forgetting that

A) global pandemic huuuge influx brainpower money thrown problem 
B) everybody half brain actually takes vaccine themselves, too. Even right-wing politicians take it. Rich people fly b get it. Everybody trying get it... Except morons. 

Which mind tbh. morons increase risk mutations. shut get vaccinated. I'm Portland, got back indoor dining gyms last week. there's push get kids back school person (for like 2 hours day), people still commonly wear masks anytime outside home, there's still tons hygeine theater lives still revolve around covid lot states. whole point deal JNJ build capacity ramp production risk. 20-30 million doses available upon EUA. JNJ admitted failed meet production objectives. They’ve definitely failed meet expectations. sure reading.  wonder complaints seem coming France Germany? UK used far vaccine far longer yet see apparent issues here. Mild side effects normal, Pfizer vaccine them, AZ vaccine them. 

Unfortunately science-illiterate media reports Germany science-illiterate politicians France Germany spread fear prolong pandemic there. 

Fortunately UK extremely high vaccine uptake get whichever highly effective vaccines available. hate assholes, seem like huge one.

I take complement kind. Nah, I’d pissed. CDC reporting 16 million people received second dose morning. I’ve getting 6 doses vial since 1 ml syringes 23 gauge needles. 3 ml, wasn’t happening, would get 5 doses  People much smarter us also created distributed things like Asbestos, Roundup, Thalidomide Agent Orange.

If want people get vaccine, maybe government given pharmaceutical companies complete immunity damage vaccine does. thing MA. Outdoors, times, regardless distance. Generally one patrols outdoors I've certainly never heard anyone ticketed one going check mail.

However, that's legal side. terms social pressure, people around absolutely buy love mandate, get face walking around without mask on. Virtually everyone exercising outside wears one.

It really sucks, doubly live apartment backyard yourself. way get fresh air - ever - abiding rules open window stick head out. I'm sure reason started regulate *that* thought it. argument you’re arguing disingenuously, directly ignoring valid questions, hiding behind “oh logical fallacy!” (from several posts ago) employing many - - own. you’ve continued prove that.

I’m actually arguing view - fact, first words **“I agree you”**. Umm easy say someone isolate. disease old. Sure, may die often many unknowns also many people long term effects. forced work group settings PPE, would feel differently. based measure risk exposure. 75 year old retired lives home much less exposed much less overall risk 55 year old works public PPE social distancing.  Wow hot take. Also incredibly stupid. It’s me, I’m 1 3 adults October? Jeez I'd expect majority offered vaccine everyone highly probable masks unless vaccinations slow significantly I’d hope would. That’s literally designed do. feel you, disgusted government working way let stranded Australians back in. don’t think people talk part enough. professor intro sociology telling incredible develop vaccine year. Slovakia uncontrolled outbreak well overtook Poland per capita infections. daily death toll around 100 right now. government shut reporting site challenged last week several health statisticians presenting incorrect number underestimating/under-reporting infection. Slovenia also uncontrolled outbreak Austria much better. Pretty much entire Central Europe f.ed. Makes sense. Measles vaccine dumb comparison.

Prior COVID, fastest vaccine development 4 years. one created **and tested** 8 months.

The US government knows risky fast-track vaccine, gave pharmaceutical companies full immunity damage may cause. disabled, disfigured killed vaccine literally recourse. mind, groceries workers right behind frontline healthcare provider nursing home residents. group relied last year. That’s...pretty much said. Sort of. said Southeast Asia. understand side-effect base rates say things like ""30 people acid reflux next day!"" that's normal amount people X get it. number zero we'd start investigating vaccines cures acid reflux! gave lot second doses yesterday one mRNA vaccines. wouldn’t surprised people would willing try getting one; anxiety high side effects second one. felt sick day second dose still think worth it, people kind dreading bet would willing risk going without. Already one, let’s add other. Boaster shot means new vaccine.  Best news fast they've able finish booster! TONS doses cancelled rescheduled, next week's numbers way higher week. Here's predictions:

*Daily deaths US double digits (7 day avg): August 2021

*Daily cases US 10,000 (7 day avg): possibly never, virus always going circulate low level, lot immunity population nearly always mild. 

*Walmart officially drops mask policy nationwide: July 2021

*No mask mandates place 50 states: June 2021 possible exceptions (e.g., hospitals, nursing homes, types public transportation, San Francisco). 

*No remaining restrictions place indoor dining entire US: June 2021 possible exceptions. sure experts domain considered option far us.

I’m expert domain. Considering things gets far. need actually *try* things know it’s going go (especially immune system...it’s insanely complicated changes vaccine protocol look minor outside might make enormous difference immune response). Especially mRNA vaccines brand new use humans- don’t historical data base judgements on.

Are serious right now? first comment. entire stance. fault know JROTC actual fact, said could enlist military age 17, response “you join JROTC 13/14.”

Do even understand context? I'm talking joining military. Like dude, going circles. I'm talking efforts made convince children join military. That's age JROTC now, huh?

When someone acting like you, absolutely. never have. You’re one making view me, again.

Well stance recruiting children unethical. arguing day. exactly counter argument? ""While Korber [couldn’t rule new hybrid transmitted human human, still evidence ability."" plans anything like original variant, definitely interesting one listen things get worse. Biden nothing vaccine rollout point. bought come summer. everything far nothing him. talking about? fun! haven’t 10 years since husband got married. wear glasses, hate contacts

Last june job called back, immedietly started looking good cloth mask would keep glasses fog. Eventually, put top mask underneath glasses. held fog up, like you, eyelash thing annoying. Eventually got used big deal Scotland Ireland seem keen Zero Covid. bizarre. hell people thinking? Last survey saw said 33% want vaccine. much herd immunity...  hope so! husband baby girl, turned 6 months (got pregnant pandemic, yea) I’ve dreaming going! hope dreams aren’t crushed lol  Uhhh wife got two doses already. First dose pregnant. cares them? Doctors first line deal sick patients. Next upper management / C-suite since they’ve supporting businesses employ people. 

May popular opinion important points widely reported think need sources. Luckily, replies link many. Again, look yourself, said above, prepared eat crow.  even understand context? know military. never said was. said unethical.

You literally never argued me. literally hadn’t even used word “unethical” (or “ethical,” matter) posted approx 2 minutes post. 

In fact, said could enlist military age 17, response “you join JROTC 13/14.” 

So either responded something irrelevant (because JROTC military thus response illogical) responded way arguing JROTC military. don’t see way interpret Jesus Christ dude I'm done you. either really fucking dumb annoying troll.

Ad-hominem, now, let ask this: arguing idea targeting children military recruitment unethical?

I never have. You’re one making view me, again. US pushing conspiracy theories since last January really stopped despite zero evidence

Escaped lab, eating bats.. crazy conspiracies pushed US govt  Well currently shortage, get done faster replace every current second dose first dose new person. Paramedic Vaccinator thousands people far.  shipment vaccine comes whatever syringe needle system find.  many different types, typically meets criteria 3ml syringe 1 inch needle. ones needle self retracts called vanish points. punctured vials expire 6 hours. Also pre filling syringes. must extracted person sits seat. many reasons, also ensures confidence recipient sees getting. I'd hope 100%!

We're going June, expect masks hope recommended mandated. sec like ""us kids too"" remembered I'm supposedly adult Glad realized young age. O.K. student, showed time, listened half time, gave teachers laughs really take serious. Used time make lot art lol. Got life soon finished.  Americans died last year cancer Covid... lower median age death that. heart disease.

Now, it’s fair compare Covid cancer heart disease several reasons, would belittle threat Covid somewhat, also far, far reasonable comparing Covid deaths sort war. purpose comparison downplay tragedy war order provide emotional inflation dangers Covid. It’s disgusting. Don’t it. Oh irony... look Reddit buying allegations China Thats kind surge want see hurt you?   Sorry bro Citation required Same, got sequestered entire month away family worst panic. Trying remain patient tough get upset. least prioritizing elderly. flu vaccine ranges anywhere 30 60 depending year. There's always outlier years with, that's average. Production issues means fewer doses originally expected approval date, 0. Same! I’ve always used moms name it’s easier. Depends live. places lot distribution capacity. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. common all. Probably, user responding say appointments booked months are. disruption overall system may week so, set back personally longer since lost appointments would due disruption. Unless manage get appointment earlier one months. works closely China. China close allies know already allowing China take charge finding source virus, setback nothing . one reasons US cutoff funding Technically speaking,

China getting much influence internationally. plan increase value currency labor costs manufacturing moved back states backfired started using slave labor. control pipeline India China iran.

Technically speaking, virus great states. china hated before.

If states it, would impressive. 

But doubt it. many leaks would've revealed now. laziness part workers wuhan lab possibly caused nepotism hires, pocketing ppe money, like. Ive telling people damn near month. Unfortunately, labeled fear mongerer wasnt partying like 2019 even though vaccinated. We're fucking close end here, Israel providing mucb real world data. hang tight, people! could help risk people without enforcing hurtful restrictions everyone. called focused protection. Remember 88% deaths risk population, protect cases lead huge amounts death instead herd immunity protect them. perfect strategy far sustainable, less damaging happen think would right thing do. People issue conflating “anti vax” people people like vaccinated, people skeptical new vaccine obvious 9 year difference long term testing. 

Vaccine companies making financially viable repercussions huge red flag. makings scandal 7 years time. Sorry, won’t pressured pigeonholes “anti science” “anti vax” think wealthy, corrupt individuals would happily make money back people’s health. struggle bit - US keeping vaccines right (at least Pfizer supply), definitely it’s right do, Canadian living US, it’s frustrating see Trump vaccine executive order continue (which keeps vaccines manufactured US, inside US). 

Most Canadian social circle isn’t feeling tons goodwill towards US right various reasons (being cut masks beginning pandemic another example - Canada relied US exports), don’t think improve US begins exporting vaccines every willing American vaccinated. least that’s understanding happen.

That said, it’s also saddening see us richer countries really sharing much poorer ones (eg, teenage American Canadian risk factors get vaccine frontline healthcare worker poor country? I’m sure part works). helping vaccinate world wipe virus PLEASE prioritize get every US citizens wants vaccine option one FIRST. variants plot twist everyone waiting people can't let go.

The question variants different. could spread more, less, more, less affected vaccines.

We still answers questions working it. lack understanding slowing speculation worry. Ultimately large trials figure vaccine effectiveness lab tests. 

One lab test shows reduced antibody response variant, thing reduced vaccine effectiveness. even vaccine effectiveness reduced say 90% 80%, could still plenty enough protect people. loss protection usually mild moderate illness.

Also takes variants spread meanwhile population immunity rising. stay ahead it, problem.

But case become problem, vaccine manufacturers working boosters variants FDA working streamlined process could get approved quickly. US would mean almost 20% country “fully vaccinated” (assuming Moderna efficacy 1 dose). while, like week maybe friend pay nanny kids. day, said mind things never went back normal. wife, kids, fancy WFH home, money world. me? I'm nannying lost job, lost prospects, find something keep afloat. struggling. can't help think selfish recognizing well crisis. one's saying that. think take precautions places like care homes lots risk people, without banning visits that's really hurting residents. offer support options shielding vulnerable members society. Meanwhile, everyone gets option live normally we've caused huge damage last decades. Basically, disregard people force everyone sacrifice everything them. happy between, right? are, really, really slowly is. 

There lot problems getting vaccine received decent amount doses hopefully we’re able start vaccinating 2,000 people per day. many mRNA vaccines drawing comparisons from? Oh right... even better, save 2nd dose booster adapted new variants. signed city website first day available (a weeks ago). got email last weekend saying everything transferred state-managed website still place queue. Wednesday night got email link make appointment today.

BTW, I’m Hampton Roads area. They're still high risk contracting disease participate spreading it, low risk actually getting dangerously ill. 

At end day prioritisation trying save many lives possible, keeping pressure hospitals, battling pandemic. makes sense give vaccines order best achieves that, maintaining measures help well. care. internship going back college finish degree 29. big prestigious company, got job done. That's true, thanks disproportionate response worldwide we'll people dying hunger (mostly little children) Covid-19 (mostly elderly). that's *just* hunger, uptick suicides, heart failure (thanks stress fear) even taken account. Holy shit dude, turn news. Stepping outside guaranteed ICU stay. level hyperbole comment ridiculous. Cooler detracting comment though? That. Good you! hit March 23 I'm going start protesting properly, year limits I'm willing sacrafice. I'm UK though everything's gone crazy despite fastest vaccination rollout. Good. gonna take 10 years vaccinate Americans. people fine staying home, watching Netflix collecting paycheck. see (or care) damage lockdown causes less fortunate. similar Emergency Department, initial 1-2 weeks. things rolled out, 75-80% slowly became vaccinated. workers “essential”?  “flatten curve” phase never understood started deeming certain workers essential.

Not really. mean, we're talking businesses shut down. need ice cream parlours, candy stores toy stores remain open, instance, whereas really cannot without grocery stores pharmacies. Even clothing stores kind essential, especially winter. 

I'm software engineer, stopped working work now, consequence would tiny company crashes goes bankrupt, downside would companies would lose money rely do. essential. last job worked software hospitals used, everyone suddenly stopped working, worst-case scenario would literally people dying. So, that's kind essential. course even place, work could done 100% remotely (and way now), really relevant terms vaccines such. New market fake IDs? That’s they’re trying live (Québec) - initially sceptical, often lot stuff wrong way seems like one may worked out. unfalsifyable claim. Ever considered able work put food table going cause families fall apart, something we've directly caused preventable. stop now. Humans social. Trivialise human interaction like essential well-being, one important things life. Living existing thing. think miserable job great people willing read crap every day.

That said remove things well sourced direct quotes miss things obvious trolling overall good job. thats literally throw away dodge realize definition threat fits.

""its political squabble"" previous link proves more.

Just continue twisting reality fit preferences. Really way right center anymore Moderna immunity takes 42 days total. What's point? Lets Stuff like pretty convinced truly much vaccines world fairly far removed Christmas/New Years. Arguably biggest holidays entire year tons people travel gather together. that's naturally cases plummeting people gathering traveling much. Lmao heard explanation, virus spread rapidly warm months last year, straight summer. Texas example saw first large surge cases June September, hottest months year, gets really hot there. think virus seasonal, least wasn't. definitely women, younger 45, wore bonnets, gloves glasses disguise older 65, age cut-off prioritised get COVID-19 vaccine Florida, according Raul Pino, director health department Orange County. Meanwhile, Indiana health department issued warning earlier month called “a substantial lack morality” people lied vaccination site workers addresses, jobs ages. Asked frustrating two women skipped queue, Mr Pino said wasn’t determine next line, referring priority scale set Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Republican.  Already better single-dose AZ JJ vaccines. 

There increasingly compelling evidence supporting offering patients option spread dose interval six weeks, least near term, double rate vaccinations. Bring family member would otherwise wait, return six weeks rather three. Safer, balance, one fully vaccinated one completely unvaccinated. think vaccination roll positive thing, considering vaccines developed less year (usually takes 10) important point potential risks people better informed way risks covid vaccine depending health. problem second half deal reneged upon. Instead passing savings outsourcing workers, workers US made work longer pay.

Maybe line enough people open shipping box go? worry ultra freezer? lot us still trying get pregnant, movies! Turns old style vaccines take significantly longer produce new mRNA vaccines.  Why? easy thing recommend.  nice causing pandemic first place. air dangerous potentially inject? Cdc says long administered within 6 weeks ok. stress, try get new appointment soon possible friend. completely agree. also want add farmer ask don’t forget us along teachers. Without farmers food fill grocery stores. don’t come contact everyday people like grocery employees we’re still working along members society. need much support. depends mean ""over"". May June, virus still around much threat (it never go away completely). Life mostly back normal point. basically healthy 18-65 lumped one group lot places. 65 crowd, supposed moving next tier essential workers people pre-existing click vaccine phases, that's I've seen states. Basically rather making 6 phases, broke 1 multiple parts lump everything together phases 2 3.

There's stockpiling going on. misleading needlessly inflammatory. Starter car! finisher car! Hold.  anyone bring home? Nothing. even make like it’s anything control There's stockpiling going on. misleading.  drop insane. Like 3 weeks ago getting 200k+ cases day, today peak week hit 68k. stockpiling them, using them. secures many different sources. come June, millions sitting storage, that's another thing. They’re either sarcastic baiting. Thankyou America said nothing grocery store workers. Coronavirus refers certain family viruses, cause colds. Covid19 caused one member virus family. also viruses (other coronaviruses) cause colds. 
 
Covid evolve existing cold virus, new virus whose origins known sure, may come bats China. 

All viruses mutate frequently. mutations either make virus less effective (so die out) effect effectiveness virus (so might stick around). currently 10's thousands different know variants covid.

There variants covid scientists think could bit contagious, vaccine might bit less effective on. media likes play dangers variants gets people scared makes likely click articles. 

All vaccines used US currently work well existing variants, cases dropping rapidly US despite presence variants. possible spread variants might cause uptick cases point spring, unlikely anywhere near big uptick saw winter, due increasing rates vaccination natural immunity. parents want kids back school.  really shouldn’t say that. 

A majority Chicago want send kids back. wealthy white minority fires. Yeah don’t think it’s getting much support airtime. There’s stuff concerning people right way ""when keeping real goes wrong"" situation, discuss amongst yourselves. Variants gaining momentum mutations cause much effective spreading. Going limb I’m virologist likelihood coupled another Mutation makes less dangerous likely coupled mutation makes dangerous, doesn’t immediately become common cold. danger contagious variant without change impact individual felt population level people get sick quicker. may actually somewhat normal lifestyle holidays!? really see bad news either. see good news Pfizer data Israel collecting. Disgusting.. Nobody stockpiling anything, sensationalised title talking doses yet produced. low volume year bigger one proper next year. Great news!  come mRNA brand new already clinical trials Zika, influenza rabies? mRNA also used cancer trials immunology treatments?

Is immune system response completely different mRNA vaccines traditional ones? scientists basing assumptions immune systems work, quite well known, 1,000s day dying day? Yep. headline state severity problem. thinking lazy get tests, presented fake results. knowingly got airplane Covid. That's absurd get criminal. Story says women 30s 40s though weather definitely factor. also keeps people stuck inside houses spreading virus, good long term Finding stuff point.   Sounds like Arizona. Biden Harris virtual visit Cardinal’s stadium feel Arizona’s rollout model states. ""good news""? Yo, I’m 100% remember country hit heavy winter weather. wouldn’t surprised slight increase next week days. I’ll agree definitely trending right direction, I’ll take decrease whatever reason. Fuck that, fucking weirdos!! kinda doubt numbers  2nd dose vax appt (Pfizer) scheduled Saturday (at 3 weeks 1st) canceled due limited supply. Local news suggests make sometime March. good info impacts delaying second dose?

— related, saw Look, I'm saying pharmacy can't give vaccines. I'm telling chain pharmacies pharmacists techs basically abused high production quotas give vaccines (which really time course filling prescriptions) disrupts workflow. 

It's convenient you, much them. Makes business money though. Dude, take deep breath calm tits. know triggered, may want take therapist priest something. Learn manage feelings. gives big surge pants They’re holes. you’re worried, water test, fill water. we've also gone 248,000 cases per day January 11th little 73,000 today

more 70% drop less 40 days Holy cow. often hear coke one leaders pollution, click head hearing 1.8 billion day.  There’s reason can’t thing, instead 3-4 weeks it’s 12. first vaccine dose already significant effects, also risk actually get Covid low. Don’t let anxiety win, fear always leads irrationality.

Covid-19 novel mutation Corona virus, causes common cold. specific mutation, cold virus became hyper contagious fatal. cold virus mutates time, specific mutant gave us Covid-19. Covid-19 virus mutates again, changes higher mutation would render virus less effective, rather effective? ""but mah quarantine!"" virus damage mentally physically. Thank God! state placed university employees part tier 1B group 1. current on-site people vaccinated. vaccinated even many high risk people work essential industries. state removed priorty future. Trump one restricted exports vaccine. us depressed anxious *BEFORE* pandemic? aren’t mandatory, it’s ok 👍 Tennessee too. complain mental there's really excuse. Besides wear mask, gather go anywhere. Even I'd surprised masks still commanplace summer. Normal lot Americans going inside store instead pickup, kids starting school person fall, visiting grandma’s house, hanging friends. So, large scale right. individual level, summer could relatively normal many Americans. Nah, we’re like now. Here’s mathematical flaw: joining age 21 ≠ join ROTC.  vaccine safe effective. keeps others safe. I'm gonna honest, I'm Montana people wearing masks anyway. think going change much anything. Maybe I’m defective then. Yeah looney toons taken thread. I’m pointing documented fact vast majority people aren’t aware of, Pfizer hailed blindly saviour. small degree scepticism healthy. Get man. little that?! would answer unrelated question?

Unrelated strawman argument directly related topic suggested. wouldn’t answer before, idea - problem post even follow logic here. said there's methods already use need list idea?

Notice didn’t say anything downsizing military, said use methods...without elaborating. problem. Pretty trivial though. 500k deaths 2020 2019 US. anything, COVID-19 deaths undercounted. always assumed want air going muscle. good way putting it, gonna say there's definitely something know way categorize lmao Puh thought one 100000 something. Seems like lot ppl going mental issues. Meditation day affirmation going sleep helps lot though. practicing often since COVID-19. besides mass gatherings like concerts sporting events, things back normal South Carolina. grateful. don’t get either. sincere honest question. Taiwan wants source BNT vaccine, well , source Shanghai Fosun. 

BioNTech uses partners, ie Pfizer Fosun, conduct clinical trials expand production. Taiwan dictate supply logistic terms here. print lancet think he's violated TOS actually deserves ban per se. best way express much DINGus is.

I'll see now... shit Start charlatan UK believe become dominant time since transmissible advantage UK variant surge testing hotel quarantine. Also study conclude whether vaccine still protects segere symptoms/hospitlisations since ultimately key. still stop hospitlisations even become widespread may mean hospitlisations suddenly increase extremely high levels again. appears case generally, yes. said, look overall mortality US 2020, 500k deaths 2019. ~500k COVID-19 deaths reported far, tells COVID-19 deaths weren’t meaningfully overcounted anything, they’ve undercounted.  context I'm area UK legally allowed meet people indoors since September. previous march-June. yet still worst death rate. I'm happy. really need seek help paranoia. fact getting many upvotes insanely disturbing shows thread highjacked lunatics. Really selfish shortsighted. India China exporting world. US cannot even sacrifice 20 mil doses something? typical arrogant self centered American attitude. really need vaccinate 20-somethings US doctors nurses Africa? 

Stuff like US Americans bad reputation world Tbh probably still around 90 percent effective even variants, would seeing lot cases vaccinated people, previously infected people getting infected new strains. really happening. happens, expected. Thx enlightening me. Perhaps joke honestly furthest depressed I've years. going office feeling pressure attend birthday parties blessing things actually stressing out.

It kind feels like rest world gets experience introverts go lives. know road well, crazy small reddit world sometimes school district Oregon yes. Basically moving forward re-opening slowly starting youngest time get middle high schools, it’ll June they’ll probably say there’s point (which isn’t point!).

In counties I’m sure it’s different mine that’s happening. think problem experts may determined risk low, means many people die. people die. Many teachers would prefer one dead people, lobbying return risk decreased. risks vector virus? highjacked specific group people.  OIC. Thx info. think read vaccines required special needles know why.  1 2 people sleeping  Ok like county 350k clocking 500 Covid deaths 2020. 600 deaths previous time high. Overdoses 10, car accidents 2, suicides 1. Lockdowns we’re par places US beginning middle road that. Stop fucking downvoting ridiculing anxious people asking questions. makes spiral fear. argument stupid. UK government asked AstraZenica manufacture Oxford vacine scared Trump going steel UK funded vacine. needed large enough company UK roots trump buy out, pay bribe.

So understand UK government vacine manufactured distributed AstraZenica facilities upgraded UK government money, understand EU never going priority UK. majority arent going want permanently virtual events. Yeah, kinda expected sort catch. 90 range seemed way good true. Minor League Baseball season *with fans* starting early Mayish, May 5 home team particular. that's sign ending, know is.

Go Lookouts! Honestly daily discussion thread highjacked lockdown skeptics covidiots

I think we've turned corner thread become ridiculous propaganda. already said office. one cares busy fucking everything else up. particles air really stick around long all. Like, order minutes, that. virus also inactivated pretty quickly exposure dry air. People getting sick thing talking face-to-face someone extended periods, people leaving trails covid particles wake touching surfaces. good. south African variant definitely reduces effectiveness Exactly 80% take offer that's still pretty good. number could rise see others take it. hard anti vaxxers maybe want wait abit first line Why? Lots people think that's appropriate sacrifice young person make. wash hands, old people die millions, part. Also wonder J&amp;J AstraZeneca change things. fact matter comes vaccine efficacy variants is, know. long enough.

There's preliminary data shows decreased efficacy variants, starting 95 percent gives absolutely huge cushion. vaccines could falter lot actually becomes problem.  AZ pretty much immune SA variant? (Only 10% effective) would care leaves Vietnam? make sense control gets in? Tests touted major cost families currently Exactly!!! Here's hoping reach *peak* soon.  Great forced trial pop too. Guess we’ll see pays longterm. little label fun participants! QOL measured many Covid deaths around you. Southeast Asia, Vietnam place be. world standards better places. 95% mild disease. excellent even prevents littlest bit symptoms. Vaccinators vaccinate vaccinators. Upvoted making numbers up, even though article correct total, 20,507,518 years life may lost due Covid-19 81 countries included study – average 16 years individual death. total years life lost, 44.9% appears occurred individuals 55 75 years age, 30.2% individuals younger 55, 25% older 75. 

An average 16 years death, 30% total life years lost 55.   Good know, thanks! great vaccine snobbery comes great vaccine jealousy feel you, keep grind, probably won’t bring happiness right now, pays bills, that’s better nothing. get better. Someday. nuanced take agree with. I'm sick masks, can't wait okay wear time, still wearing mask whenever appropriate. 

but way people talk would think they're literally muzzled gestapo. Let fix headline you:

1 **1** adults depressed **and** anxious due COVID-19 


No one wonderfully, lot people good lying (and others) CDC guidance pregnancy? Irrelevant. actually pregnant. 

I'm sure believes perfectly valid reason refusing vaccine. matter whether valid not. matters employer requiring employees get vaccine (which completely legal right) said no. Honestly, think I’d feel better lived different state. stay anxious upset time fact son lost job insurance state doesn’t qualify Medicaid can’t find anyplace hiring provides insurance. I’m constantly afraid he’s gonna get sick injured. already depressed anxious admit, privileged. daughter excelled online school traveling commuting (I've working home), I've managed pay credit card debt things. bad everyone. acknowledge lucky regard. think tax dollars need go toward COVID19 relief lucky. Get damn stimulus passed! would've thought?? question misses. answered. 

Simple that: would choice, would prefer vaccine better protection form covid, light severe. choice, might take get. 

The technique vector virus risks, would prefer another technique choice. 

It comes options. Wait one month better vaccine? would probably consider it. Wait fall? Hard decision. Wait winter? way. 

And think selfish: no, nearly contacts, would hardly spread it. want trade I'm months away even potentially eligible vaccines mate. Pfizer 2nd dose 12 weeks first UK Two doses 21 28 days, 90. considering started trials 10 months ago lot long term data whatever Quebec started January. daft? Well doctors definitely worthy. 

Especially considering would exposed higher viral load treating covid patients I've thinking lot well. I'm like 14 getting vaccine anytime soon, seem pretty weird people like forced get it. given someone else want it? still want get vaccine completely see others would wear mask outside? Hey man, 1000% agree hate zoom I’m expressing fear based I’ve seen people act lately regarding ‘new normal’ got Moderna, fiancee got Pfizer. Every day hear good news one bad news other, hopefully we're pretty protected. I'm still waiting second dose done hers. parents fortunate enough vaccinated well (my dad weeks second dose) we're really looking forward getting back normal, hopefully end year. We've part since vaccine started, way less social people know, even pretty progressive city. nice see parents close friends without worrying killing them.  that’s great ebola vaccine mrna vaccine, i’ll wait proper data related specific technology - i’m totally onboard speeding vaccine creation using brand new technology trade numbers better rock solid 2020 mortality America 18% expected. increase deaths 2019 220 500,000. Typically annual increase 45,000 average. Ever since state emergency declared US, life felt like one long, slow, traumatic event. Especially Texas winter storm. hard optimistic. hard positive. People keep posting misleading headlines banned... know reading hard. also reductive break complex issues ""REMOTE SCHOOL BAD, OPEN SCHOOL GOOD"" stop galaxy brains. Hope feel better soon. Try let personal experience outstrip science. thinking getting Moderna software.

Which one excited about? Pretty sure 94% chance symptoms exposed COVID.

6% chance symptoms.

Basically 0% chance death based trials, long already deaths door seriously compromised immune system. think everyone plane would've died? first detected hard fact, started conjecture. That's it? friend 20 got hospital heart attack caused covid earlier season. Youre right, deadly elderly.  Hmmmm, think happened Ebola, think would happen Covid.

Pretty strange assume unlikely situation enrage yourself. screw many things God bless US logistics. :( TBF crowd also probably predisposed either already contracted point anyways. probably represent much higher rate naturally acquired immunity rest us (at least ones dead) also contributes herd immunity.  fine? Seems like jail time reckless endangerment would appropriate. need differentiate people take three weeks recover people take six months recover. windows way wide freaking about. massive issue, would evident population issue. Actually modified =P logic flawed. low transmission children adult would care teacher vaccinated not? According theory teacher adults like parents need worry. Remember teacher around kids 6 hours day. parents spend twice around kids.

The reality simply guessing whether children good bad spreading virus. virus new certain many things transmission kids kids kids adults one many guessing at. Remember one time claiming kids super spreaders... convenient opening schools good spreading. That's problem flip flopping government experts, change 180 degrees people stop believing anything say whether true not. vaccine mean can't catch spread virus? think thats default expectation emerged even small allotment finalized lawmakers approve legislation indemnifies vaccine maker responsibility event death adverse reaction taking shot. says scientists medical experts ought coordinating supervising Philippine operations combat COVID-19, rather military generals unfamiliar epidemiology, immunology virology currently call shots. Retired General Carlito Galvez, country's vaccine czar, confirmed Philippines already secured 25 million doses Chinese manufacturer Sinovac small consignment due arrive month. Lowering hospitalization death doesn’t end pandemic. Stopping spread ends pandemic. significance median age proven.

However, that's assuming vaccine 100% effective, isn't, 95% effectiveness, still .33×.2+.95×.67=70.25%. hand, people want vaccine might also likely refuse public health guidance thus may already infected higher rates population average, would push non-susceptible number higher.

Weird address anything raised specifically China, since shit slinging rando offering solutions, gg I’m big proponent “vaccine passports” anything international travel, maybe businesses movie theaters, theme parks, restaurants, bars, etc. offer small discounts free bonus items showing proof vaccine (this everyone wants vaccine able get one).

Getting small perk discount, like 5% discount restaurant bar bill free candy bar purchase combo meal movies could incentive someone needs get vaccine. people plan go big entertainment spending COVID dies down, savings bonuses add quickly, enough even money savvy anti-vaxxers may give chance.

Feel confident comfortable I’ve ever felt, certainly wasn’t easy tho. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well done say! Huzzah!! got second dose vaccine today 6 hours ago. Besides sore arm don’t feel anything, hoping I’m lucky don’t get adverse effects. One best friends flu symptoms day second dose cannot imagine believing person's worth employability. disgusting thing say.

I'm going convince care people. I'm going convince elders play vital role communities. different values, would waste time. I’m getting moderna vaccine tomorrow. VA opened vaccine appointments veterans age “essential workers” (pretty much every industry point). Los Angeles county, expect things going well fucking VA figured out.  *Cries non prioritized group* see rule-breaking comments, please report them! Today's daily thread alone thousand comments, need help finding rule-breaking ones :) antidepressants since 16 I'm 43. Mom unlucky ones family everyone else fine never mental illness,. understand never will, grandmother told needed pull bootstraps. Sometimes hard find reason keep going. year bad even antidepressants Dewey guy's fault  💎🙌 Yeah, you’re right say that. like reply says, it’s promising least *some* indication isn’t worst case scenario. point, science comes through, I’m willing hang vaccinated folks get jab myself. Honestly I'm hoping completely vaccinated end July hope it'll least month sooner. DeSantis how? I'm SF think normal life, like crowded bars, back July 4th. Thank response.

The holes look transparent.

How convince masks safe ? PCP. pharmacy. get flu shot there. COVID? need nap, friend. Wow, Serious reduction cases deaths USA
down 300k cases 4500 deaths day, 70k 2500

This plus 57 million vaccination shots.......... looking positive think anyone wants way super hard.  asking people worry ""greater good."" personally find spending time online happy hours/games works me. feel connected good time. suggesting set one up, people would show up. know fear planning something worrying putting end sitting alone. know one ventilator, ask others right, perhaps they're perfectly fine. supply -- getting people issue. set appointment 10 weeks instead 3. staggering additional 7 weeks means 120 million+ people (partially) vaccinated mid-April. 

There minimal attrition relative 3 weeks, matter much almost every adult want vaccine vaccinated mid-April (in US). Thank posting this! Canada implemented much stricter measures since Christmas. 

Canada’s province houses half population announced stay home orders

I don’t think measures changed US Lol. it’s actually efficacy vs control group. unvaccinated group size X, living particular life 100 people tested positive, another vaccinated group exact size, living exact life, would find 4 positives! No. people can't take much longer. getting back normal within next months. Keep mind 1 3 adults US means roughly 50% adults think pandemic real serious. Please elaborate. getting impression mRNA vaccination doesn’t confer immunity?  Stores still too! There’s whole lot “we want look like we’re part taking super seriously” crap unnecessary now.

Nevertheless, keep on.... mind wearing mask right now, look forward wearing Fuck two women hilarious. infinity... beyond! think argument highly at-risk population (especially 65+ LTC) get second dose ASAP maximize death risk reduction. that, numbers game get many people vaccinated quickly possible. 

It's logical position. There's incredibly low risk delaying second dose materially impacts long term efficacy (in fact, modest delay likely IMPROVE long term efficacy). huge risk two month time lag vaccinating enough herd immunity. 

You're trading abstract, hypothetical supported known science risk* massive, clearly defined death reduction. That's irrational position. 

\* Yes, always risk theories mechanisms action wrong. immune science says waiting 8 weeks big deal - actually likely optimal cementing permanent immune response. 3+ months discussion risk.  saw county-level numbers either local health department local news coverage. makes feel better, I’m glad I’m alone b direct evidence applicable. vaccines effective preventing disease reducing spread. Without direct evidence vaccines work, best err side caution messaging. Bay Area here, essentially we’re shut down, many businesses even attempting restore outdoor dining even though it’s legal. fantastic! high enough percentage population gets vaccinated, perhaps even old vulnerable people get vaccinated, looks like society return normal. Vaccine production needs ramped meet demand. repeat, thank God Joe Biden charge deranged, moronic, lazy piece shit. charge point would single digit vaccinations majority stock sold North Korea, Saudi Arabia, probably Sweden. positive. honestly think 2022 safer bet bigger events like this.

This mean second shot useful. is. strongly cements immunity system immune cascade works (and different response cascade initial vaccine response). point is, sickness feel means immune system going drive.

Holding second shot - even 8 week stagger something similar - would vaccine game changer. obvious thing do. Funny. Sounds like someone can’t actually back argument would say.

Doesn’t way, that’s California teacher’s union wants kids, that’s it’s going kids No. 2 months wearing mask Generally yes. science public communication clash it’s bit stupid. Scientists saying “There evidence vaccine stops transmission.” Newspapers print bold implying “Vaccines don’t stop spread!!!PANIC!” 


What scientists actually mean say is: “looking every vaccine history plus early data...yeah- seems like going mostly stop transmission. Probably reduce transmission like 75-95% even catch (which 20x lower chance non-vaxed person)... Buuuttt haven’t actually documented evidence published study, let’s wait see.”


It would unprecedented epidemiology vaccine didn’t reduce transmission all. Well stack covid Texas ice storm. Im feeling pretty fucking low right now. would explain english may strong suit.

UK fairly diverse, tho. So, maybe? What’s wrong that? Pharmacies logical place get vaccine. High school gyms not.  Thank you. like thier trail participants forced quarantine 57 days, lived life normal. think means results trial reflect expect real world. pretty good. Sounds like pussed making prior approval Ironic? US entitled work creating funding making vaccine? teachers unions directly responsible continued closures. advocating closures, blame u Us retail pharmacies ability 100M vaccinations month karma taking hit tho. resisted putting /s there. hilarious think entitled view.

So ironic. Yah, I've convinced mom get vaccine available her, made clear circumstances vaccine J&amp;J  Well, it’s “very contagious via surface transmission”, thanks good luck According CDC, 1.5 mil vaccine doses given today. bad, things considered. God really thought pandemic thing through. madlad it! gaslighting back! think fact know many vaccines help block transmission many viruses count science behind it. 

It’s anti-vaxxer kids don’t get polio, measles, many viruses live country high vaccination rates. Plus epidemiological evidence people SARS-CoV-2 never develop symptoms don’t transmit virus nearly many contacts symptomatic counterparts, think would shocking vaccine prevents 95% symptomatic cases found anything prevent transmission.

This either disinformation wishful thinking. Barely difference UK European AstraZeneca contract: EU signed earlier, Brits got vaccines

There appear much difference contracts pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca signed United Kingdom European Union. That's according comparison two contracts, possible British contract online. appears British subject condition EU. Moreover, Europe signed contract AstraZeneca day earlier. contradicts company previously claimed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

The American news channel CNN reported morning coveted contract tacitly online months. long time, journalists EU policymakers asking UK contract AstraZeneca made public. 

&amp;#x200B;

Indeed, Pascal Soriot, CEO AstraZeneca said interviews contract European Union include contractual obligation supply vaccines, clause act ""to best ability."" is, must make necessary efforts, contain hard obligations fulfill promises.

&amp;#x200B;

The vaccine manufacturer announced late January could deliver 60 percent fewer vaccines EU promised. European Commission criticized reduced delivery due clause. Geert Bourgeois (NV-A) Guy Verhofstadt (Open VLD) also criticized mere effort commitment EU contract recent weeks. blamed Europe negotiating hard enough, unlike British. clause appears British contract. 

&amp;#x200B;

How exactly AstraZeneca's corona vaccine manufacturers work? pros cons? science journalist Koen Wauters explains clearly video:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First come, first served?

The Commission upset suspected AstraZeneca giving British priority. Soriot responded problem lay two separate production lines. British would get vaccines two UK plants EU two plants Netherlands Belgium. top executive believed Europe unlucky latter two factories production problems ahead them. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The newly discovered contract states British receive vaccines five production sites, although locations plants omitted. good chance factories located continental Europe also supplied vaccines UK.

&amp;#x200B;

According Soriot, UK contracted company much earlier, would given faster vaccines. appears Europe already signed contract AstraZeneca day sooner British. Although manufacturer defends reaction Dutch Public Broadcasting (NOS) argument already reached agreement UK May, meant production chain could started earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

The company guaranteed players contracts would hinder execution. remains unclear British received vaccines EU.

Although, working state reasonable mask mandate regulations, probably reduced risk compared average warehouse grocery store worker.

Soviet Union incredibly productive. many people forget country nearly completely destroyed. 20 million dead. agricultural lands damaged etc. able send humans space long pretty amazing. Google vial filling machine. Lots there. work company makes something similar. high speed machines run thousands vials minute. slower speed machine 400 vials/min. quite right. Canadian govt signed deals EU manufacturers vaccine, fear export ban (at time potential 2021) Trump administration. EU facilities trouble ramping production, EU one threatening export bans. literally linked articles genuinely remarkable thing New York Times, US’s prestigious newspaper, devoted considerable resources investigating China didn’t address pandemic even quickly effectively (FAIR.org, 10/14/20, 1/20/21). exposés China’s “missteps” generally boil Beijing taking virus seriously enough January 23, 2020, put entire city Wuhan quarantine—at point virus implicated 17 Times‘ specifying “the United States democracies” group countries China comparing bit red herring. it’s true many US allies weathered pandemic poorly US did, several wealthy countries multi-party political systems far better—including New Zealand, South Korea, Australia, Japan, Iceland, Norway Finland. disparity much “authoritarian” states “democracies,” Times suggests, countries took coronavirus seriously good good enough, China’s coronavirus response obsession New York Times.

US media get hide behind ""but lie, we're reporting people's lies"" act propaganda multipliers. get pretend journalistic integrity manufacture narratives omit key information relative presented (see: Hong Kong's ""wave"" 75 infected day versus NYC suffering 4000 America Russia every nation it.*

Tell US whole gets labelled liars something one elected officials said, like CNN article labels entire Chinese government entirety China. Honestly murky water Seacrests may started lol Fake news That's wickedly overblown point blatant misinformation, stop saying things like that.

In nutshell:

The Pfizer vaccine good 10 days time origin nothing sitting floor original shipping container, remains usable 5 days normal fridge temperatures.

The first 10 days extended 30 days refilling container dry ice every 5 days, starting day 10.

That's it. That's it.

With stable, ""omg cold"" freezers, Pfizer vaccine stored six months.

But we're sitting stuff two weeks we're already something wrong storage conditions nothing Yeah? shit actual injury. YES

We also find every COVID flu death past 10 years, figure people contact with, arrest possibly passed virus causing death. 10% 90% get long covid, sometimes months initial infection. That's 1 chance 5 get hit hard disease point.

And that's know disease *how*, little. .5% lives. know amounts bottle vaccines?

Getting moderna, AZ vaccines obviously help well. Florida mask mandate major counties cities require them, although enforcement done via businesses since they're ones get trouble maskless patrons.

Living FL, indoor mask compliance pretty good, I'd say least 75-80%. Outdoor masking different frankly care someone wear mask they're walking around outside. don't. Calling something hackathon doesnt make cool edgy. bet industrious, able get first one end april. May take hunting, right that's expectation imo. “Calm down” makes problem learn! I'd bet Moderna, J&amp;J goes chain also. get whichever highly effective vaccines available.

This vaccination plan, PM hastily covering tracks.

I'm french get AZ, I'd've preferred pfizer, like doctor would've herself, unfortunately, puts it, race virus time finicky. She'll getting AZ too.

We might get chance swap another vaccine next year, might well get one health agency selected risk group.

And France, vaccinated oesn't mean stop social distancing safety measures. vaccines stopping spread tracks reducing mortality. Supply getting distributed fine. number doses issue. I'm betting supply numbers pushing 20M next week's announcement. That's nearly 3M day. giving 1.7M day. That's bottleneck going forward demand becomes bottleneck. time, calming paradoxically makes irrational fears worse.

There’s reason exposure therapy gold standard anxiety/OCD - learn face fear gradually diminishes anxiety response. reassured makes anxiety worse time telling brain, “hey, actual issue need reassurance over.” post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

My brother-in-law stop ranting China keeps screwing US trade, horrible are, etc., yet **every** holiday son gets gift family shipped via Amazon reputable brands COUOMOXA, Obuby, etc. Mask wearing isn’t protected class. They’re well within rights turn away you’re wearing mask. Evil defends Root cause, root cause!!!! need root cause! then, then, America get busy!!!!  Either read actual paper, understand it, intentionally lying. it?

That methodology used all. many upvotes comments thread obviously, laughably, nonsense. subreddit often echochamber wishful thinking desperation now, far removed key results total YLL YLL ratios YLL distributions relatively robust co-morbidity bias.

Thus, ratio YLL COVID-19 compared causes death robust co-morbidity bias estimate level YLL biases present numerator denominator. 

 life lost COVID-19 81 countries - actual paper. YLL = years life lost. However they’re told act media. Would fine giving vaccines... US vaccinated whole country? imagine that's they'll gladly give countries. Fake quote “But wearing mask!” *takes mask drink coffee like 5 god damned minutes* First bats, meat market, pangolins, Italy, frozen salmon, unc, Spain, frozen meat, Maryland... long anywhere lab focused bat viruses closest epicenter; that's matters.

Tldr: get samples wastewater Wuhan? It’ll probably still officially pandemic designated 2022 possibly even 2023. could take long time low income countries fully vaccinate residents Lmao likelihood, Moderna good. There’s info available Pfizer it’s focus study. Yeah. clearly obviously answer. 

The many virtue signalling ""Yeah! Grocery store workers deserve it! Something something actually respect essential workers!"" posts actually voted top seem flat ignore entire world currently lack supply vaccines. Right much zero sum game every vaccine given healthy young grocery store worker vaccine *not* given 60+ year old way likely die.

It's incredibly easy say ""I think people deserve vaccines right now!"" put fingers ears decide contend fact takes vaccination opportunities away others. They're over. hits 8am China downvotes tend come pouring in. It’s almost like people don’t care minimum wage workers—- shocker really strange England we've administering vaccine months and, yes, side effects (for people), pfizer vaccine; debilitating side effects. So, either we're made sterner stuff Germans, rabbit away somewhere. feel really privileged gotten first vaccine back mid December. believe current President did.*

Link here, way point blame whole nation*

I explicitly referring US media US government. Meanwhile, US disinformation machine spreading bullshit implying Chinese people eats bats. PS: People vote leaders really share responsibility everything elected representatives type consequences would wanna see?*

A official apology can't walked back, US officials explicitly pointing lies spewed previous administration clarifying lies. Newspapers responsible mass spreading lies issuing full retractions front page, open everyone especially readers see.

I literally linked Washington Post, New York Times, Reuters Western media sources spreading particular narratives based falsehoods already. want lies debunked mouths.

And no, get claim US can't blamed previous elected administration said official channels, CNN articles linked literally blames ""Beijing"" China Chinese official said. people like bred long ‘Til MSM scares everyone **deadly new variant** everyone falls line again.

Seriously, we’ve swine flu, ebola, etc. but... something changed time. People obeyed mandates. government knows they’ll again.

I bleak view future. saw PA kid. Asia people internet= Korea, China. case rates higher today start September... got Moderna American. Honestly doesn’t matter though. say so. Like countries, United States government duty citizens first foremost. Given 500,000 people lost lives still averaging around 2,000 people daily basis, see anyone reasonably expect United States share vaccines stage. gather around 60m people jab United States, still bit work vulnerable safeguarded. I'm guessing without public healthcare system place, fair chunk 60m vulnerable.

Your post suggests way 'most world' operates break backs help everyone else own, demonstrably apply corner world. Good, encourage traveling vaccine adoption. Wonder they'll actually implement though cards easy forge every vaccination center digital version easily access. good news thanks ! Grocery store (and retail) workers consistently exposed entire pandemic dont choice, unless want get fired. you? “Our media” Who? Find examples else opinion. examples journalists making arguments company was. someone coming network that’s perspective media journalists. 

Your playing victim card pretty hard. Every nation bad things every nations government officials say stupid harmful things. China America Russia every nation it. grow grow Black white logic using Oxford vaccine won’t stop spread virus though. 1/3 chance getting sick possibly spreading others. That’s good thing especially considering don’t know long term health effects even mild infection could have. don’t blame wanting better vaccine offers better protection. one effective flu vaccine, flu vaccines weakest vaccines have. Nobody thinks that. ....always? consider covid-19 variant coronavirus, ok, tell virologist genetics lmao Look state's ""medical reserve corps"". national program states run/participate in. state make account list qualifications, languages, work experiences, etc. have. focus medical training, though often tap people spots like mentioned. Aaaaaaackshwilllllyyyyyy...this classic sign know an.American political party playing same.game. IM injection? tiny volumes considered, probably not. I’m expert though. know people peripheral IVs tolerate mL air without major issues. Central IVs different matter though. 

Considering you’re injecting vaccine bloodstream, rather muscle, would guess it’s fine?

The key fill syringe accurately enough air take dead volume syringe.

In case, would always err side caution - ie little less air vs much, little vaccine vs little. might still cause wastage vaccine, overall far less original method. coming again. effected slow downs due plants expanded.  Az/Oxford approved soon j&amp;j novavax plant.  new variants require boosters new year better situated react.  


Hard build plants vaccine might work last year.  promised vaccines far let purchases.  could done sure. believe current President did. don’t think he’s office given ridicules things past leader said could take days go list get it. Ether way point blame whole nation it’s government like haven’t blamed China it’s whole government media like using Black White wording. 

What type consequences would wanna see? type could done? Coming President isn’t much vocally call many did. 

Show examples major US media outlets backing supporting trump said truth? think 1 major one rest spent time calling explaining it’s fake. I’m going need see examples several large media company’s backing talking points. 1 media company was. time consequences wanna see? 

And compensations? First prove every single example attacks directly due statements made back president whoever said it. Next take whoever said it. government massive entity made million people. It’s 1 monolith. go find people said hold accountable using black white logic don’t wear buy them, KN95 like $1.20 per mask, $2.25 nearly twice price. they? American political party exact thing towards China. Chinese used vitamin C dissolved saline. used lieu ventilators, since ran ventilators trained personnel. claim patients much better long term. rates infection dropping rate US, lockdown. California really starting piss off. High risk going now. Afain case numbers never really sky rockets came close crushing numbers.  still far better us. province drs long term care homes vaccinated phizer deaths coming from.  rest us waiting turn. I’m estimated 400 000 line.  drs yesterday clinic approved give vaccines said vacinated July august isn’t fast would like it’s horrible. 30 cases per day average city 850000 isn’t great far bad. 

So still really well it’s nice see us made massive change direction headed.  I’ll either. astounding watch afar happening. good news pfizer makes regret taking moderna one commenter say came Lab?*

Some Chinese officials made retorts US government started flinging blatant fake news official channels. media pretended China engaged spreading fake news (see title ""Beijing pushed conspiracy US""), completely omitted fact reason Chinese officials said anything reacting US's bullshit.

Here calling US government disavow previous lies apologize Chinese people. Xi Jinping, CCP, Chinese people racially targeted due years bullshit. 

I wanted US government publicly walk back comments previous administration made confirm full shit along, everyone knew deep down. saying high BMI diabetes prioritized elderly ages, yet always voted.  Lol real. entire world though US would one reject vaccination. Instead it’s full steam ahead Europe struggling now. Lou, keep we'll sitting pretty. would good thing well. Anti-vaxxers scum bags actively sabotage public health. think they've done medical trials before, like twice past thousand years. done figured out. one things Trump never forgiven prioritized. not, prioritize risk factors make susceptible. not, serious ethical questions raised. Whatever anyone thinks goal be, it’s inaccurate say lowering hospitalization death stops pandemic. It’s pandemic long large number people around world sick, even don’t get hospitalized die. Also it’s proven large numbers vaccinated people infected. caring ourselves.  restrictions mandates protecting everyone.  21000 deaths large porting coming private care homes huge failure part. anyone let go laid immediately received 2000$ per month bank accounts. It’s 1400&amp; per month. save lot people financial ruin.  could done lot better. 

Our issue lack facilities manufacturer mRNA vaccines. produce flu vaccine locally. 


There may liked see us suffer majority wanted US really well high case counts deaths isn’t good us. Both. video article, so... Umm? Yea fuckin shit no, see need ""personally responsible"" stop drinking 1.8 billion sodas day.

We aren’t smug really. see many people suffering misinformation lack basic healthcare want guys join rest first world healthcare something never worry decide food/housing medical bill.  rich country easily make change.  

We assholes though insult hockey beavers. paying tens billions research development addition paying vaccines themselves.

The Pfizer/Biontech vaccine entirely self-funded two companies, one German one American. Moderna accepted cash fed. vaccines reliant purchase orders developed countries. government stopped saying so, consequence would still anxiety depression. you, back normal, even lived Florida. may well safe get vaccinated multiple times multiple different types vaccines. also might safe could lead ADE. don’t enough data yet can’t recommend it’s proven safe. could take months, could take years. only. countries trying exchange AZ BioNTech. course, choice

Poland, example, sending AZ Ukraine. This. recently discovered AZ contract UK signed also best effort contract. that, apparently EU actually signed first. it’s _just_ Ursula idiot. way all. 

Thank local govt bringing life halt. blame virus itself. Depression lowers life expectancy average 5 years physically alters brain greatly harms immune system. Thus significantly likely die earlier depression

I’ll throw ass pretending people wanting social interaction boils overthrowing government too. Good night better stop spreading misinformation 100% protection severe disease enough. Problem pandemic self

We need protection lockdown, i.e. protection SA similar strains. AZ fails here. Fatality rate absolute doesn’t change country country. Testing rate does. you’ll get higher fatality rate country tests less heard vaccines 1st grade September... Agreed, except global labour market bit. Every lost ""expensive"" 1st world job got replaced 3 ""cheap"" developing 2nd world jobs. globally job market expanded, cost western blue collar jobs. Globalisation first foremost benefits western elites also developing countries whole. You’re one arguing straw man. says US EU won’t sending vaccines developing countries point future? commitment already made. might happen fast we’d like, happen. absolutely evidence suggest massive nationwide underreporting deaths. Maid cook, former hailing poor state Uttar Pradesh latter hailing Jharkhand received news massive deaths across villages.

Lol wealthy person country full people living less 2 dollars per day claiming maid cook suffering means everything absolutely fine. can't make up. tell one reading article. proposal interisland travel. Right still need quarantine islands, kinda. Go Oahu kauai? Cool? Oahu Kauai? 14 days. definitly inhuman animal killing practices knowledge fur industry kills animals. animals lives treatments worse majority meat eat. 

So frnakely it’s pretty silly decide fur immoral eat meat (I know lots vegetarians don’t either, aminority anti fur people overall.)

I don’t fur think I’m allowed say “those poor minks” McDonald’s chickens living whole lives top other? Twitter banned Trump balls ban Chinese government account spreading fake news propaganda.

This sad world live in. worry, you’ll get shit together eventually.

21k deaths population 37 million people vs 493k deaths population 328 million, math pretty easy pal. Problem though lockdown loinger people get vaccinated. decide open everyone got shot people risk mutations render vaccines ineffective. stupid picky vaccines right least irresponsible wearing mask giving fact even AZ reduces chances transmitting virus. wish media nad politicians would start framing way, shaming anti-maskers kinda trick, compliance mask wearing really high need money, Biden. need vaccine. understand?

Could instead money send 10 millions vaccine Canada? offload bit European vaccine facilities delivering whole World?

America: another 2,700 COVID-19 deaths

r/coronavirus: ""if wear mask socially distance even one day I'm going overthrow government"" 10 millions doses 2020 disappeared. 

My question, got 10 mln doses delivered EU? 

Israel, UK, UAE? Oh Canada. Missed flair. Idk would Good you! helping, also getting invaluable clinical practice. Things like, spot deal nervous people (do ask lot questions? nervous. talk lot? probably nervous. kind inappropriate jokes? probably mega-nervous. silent? semi-nervous), things safe self-protecting manner (even assistant, make sure follow med admin steps checking ID DOB double checking contras, actually administering correctly without SIRVA complications), explain vaccine 2nd shot usually gives heavier reactions layman's terms (1st bad guy coming western town, sheriff kicks ass sends way, 2nd bad guy coming back, whole townsfolk gathers kick ass they're fed shenanigans), etc.

Good luck, fun! took six months start feeling normal again. used cardio walking almost every day go back it. top bad symptoms like shortness breath took 4 months go away, weird symptoms unnerving, and,there many them. Peeling skin fingers. Buzzing/vibrating face. Traveling pains around organs, could tell ones. Pain around eyeballs. Brain fog. could go won't. Anyway, long time now, feel almost normal, still gone back regular walking used do. I've developed anxiety around (so dumb, know) scary able breathe. really reason think safe. question would interfere rather enhance other's actions. 

Just me, reality enough mRNA vaccines moment. pandemic still going strong, need people get protection. waiting multiple month without vaccinated, AZ vaccine bit weaker, larger risk taking much smaller risk wait longer get mRNA booster tiny risk able get that. 
And get wrong, I'll also rather get mRNA shot, would probably accept AZ knowing mRNA ones get available later time point. 3-4? Could tell us precisely? contract secret?

EU billions develops vaccines. BioNTech got money.

Pfizer deliver 10 mln doses EU 2020, deliever lot Israel contract signed paid late 2020.

EU investigate reason.

There abstract Pfizer World. vaccine batches. Israel getting EVERYTHING Europe instead getting US, best ally Israel. US, best ally Israel, forbids export vaccine Israel.

Nip bud Really hope happens west coast fall, would love go Eh, like wrong. worded politely people's delicate sensibilities. back still claiming evidence it’s airborne. vaccine must kept cold help transporting Ok sure. I’m saying COVID couldn’t taste anything either. fair, original comment could given impression complaining lack availability vaccines requirement vaccinated, really point. mean true.

It part vaccination situation frustrating. US populace largely ignores guidelines, cases run rampant, govt completely mismanaged everything. vaccine production, turn around horrible situation quickly.

Meanwhile Canadian govt done better job keeping people afloat COVID helping keep cases down... also made enough purchases lined vaccine per capita country world. problem suppliers make good deals US banned exports.

In year vaccinated anyway matter thr US still broken Healthcare system. dumb. vaccine better vaccine. Take ""inferior"" vaccine offered, later take superior one. need both. Mass sites make appts scheduling easier, since hundreds hour. Plus get economies scale assembly line. tryna guy, but, it’s perception (not sense) taste influenced sense smell. know covid cause loss sense smell, I’m wondering actually causes loss sense taste, perceived way. get appointment? health dept, pharmacy direct sign up, something else? Lol. Yes included, mean ones transmitting. looking relative attack rate, they're looking across entire group. would possible (although unlikely) every single pre-symptomatic person transmitted none asymptomatic people study did. could get results differentiate, real rate likely somewhere equal transmission.

[Household secondary attack rates increased symptomatic index cases (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) asymptomatic index cases (0.7%; 95% CI, attack rates asymptomatic index cases ranged 0% 2.8% (9 studies). Pre-symptomatic secondary attack rates ranged 0.7% 31.8% (10 probably right number virus R0 COVID, whatever.

Also, literally NONE ""sources"" provided showed conditions asymptomatic cases. I'm saying impossible, evidence support it. promised 220m promise changed, correct? fellow Canadians frustratingly docile. Price bit low, 17k least. amount economic damage would caused even close $8500 got. You’re sense taste influenced sense smell. COVID temporarily lost sense smell taste. worst hit country, nations donating U.S. right we're going articles argument Yes. find sad. misunderstanding data. two dose regimen (the version trialed) found vaccine effective 95% *people*. like individual 95% immunity- either one 95% people generate immune response suitable protect symptomatic infection part 5% treatment ineffective.

The second dose two purposes. One, increases likelihood vaccine effective individual. Two, likely prolongs immunity significantly longer. great reasons get second dose.

The side effect questions best discussed doctor. Hey, know probably mean much stranger everything going alright eventually. We're approaching end this, fresh chance. animals get mostly get humans. It’s almost always humans spreading it. voters picked Ted Cruz. fuck cares think? get AZ vaccine wait others become available booster.

We months, possibly even years away option people. boosters haven’t even begun testing yet. listening podcast Russia major player vaccines back days Polio. two-thirds already depressed anxious events (personal societal). Maybe little less two-thirds. adults still all-around happy content. still think many people still wear businesses might still require them. live Orlando stores people volition wear masks. might "" soon"" always hear lack enforcement mandates change much want wear masks still wear them, wear mandate ended, yet numbers going down. Yes. think open April mad rush get Going bar mask misses point experience. Hard me. Science involve lot common sense though. It’s necessary part scientific method. I've heard conflicting info vaccine. stop people able spread vaccinated not? pretty much testing done. get J&amp;J going, pretty much use infrastructure vaccines testing. someone massive anxiety OCD second this. someone asking question doesn’t mean “doom posting”. think fears unfounded reality, calm down. downvoting explanation nothing ease someone’s anxiety. That's weird, definitely supposed observed 15 minutes (or 30 high risk) allergic reactions. 

Not saying pharmacies play role, definitely should! There's lot good reasons give ample supply retail pharmacies, maximum efficiency one though. NACDS claim (100M/month) highly dubious.

Anyway, really matter we're following pharmacy strategy means. fact federal government starting open FEMA run mass vaccination sites also expanding retail pharmacy program. hands deck. That’s impossible. Cats animals carry it, there’s essentially possible way eliminate it, unless want try track every wild stray animal earth injection.  He's talking US Western nations too. would certainly help lot. doctors nurses poor countries know. could use help. CDC publishes weekly allotments state. Believing China. wait stop hearing daily grocery store workers teachers victims exactly vaccines for? Assault requires intent threaten harm threat harm. Crimes generally require mens rea specific reqs. wish people would stop saying “he charged with...” make law seems fit.

This may reckless endangerment, assault. Unless got plane yelled “were covid positive gonna COUGH UP” followed proper protocols beginning, like countries faster, successful recoveries, would already.

What countries ""faster, successful recoveries"" ""out already""? wrong WHO. soon, need national standard ok lift mask mandates like certain positive % something. Right it’s vague. Yeah, that's meant. probably would clearer knew statistics/earth science. yes, paying taking Biden's money NIH allow checks Wuhan virology lab started this. elections consequences, get Aw it’s little funny It’s funny. That’s We’re less month Biden’s Presidency. figured we’d exceed whole “100 doses/100 days thing” we’re going exceed long shot. like ""promised"" immediate $2k checks welcome future baby one $75 per order? like shot. gets hard might perfectly fine use one dose. it’s also plausible won’t fine use one dose

Is really ""equally plausible""? First dose known trigger significant protection somewhere around day 10 lasting least several weeks.. *likely* immunity disappear within next several need actually try things know it’s going go might perfectly fine use one dose. it’s also plausible won’t fine use one dose. That’s decision make blindly expect better coin flip.

This argument cuts ways: Pfitzer Moderna trials lasted ~3 months? know protection lasts longer that? part trial! Yet, somehow assume vaccine continues protect. continue protect first dose?

Is solid scientific argument 2nd dose protection different first-dose-only protection? fear here. Fingers crossed it’s soon! Asymptomatics still included group, they're still responsible spread. Also, important know effective vaccine reducing type Covid infection need least 50% ford herd immunity. Also asymptomatics still [organ [long hauler [blood Covid.

That’s 45mph speed limit. Bake away, toys. me, thing matters number active cases community given day. immune, likely catch covid case numbers rise.

In terms one's risk today, matter much many others immune, unless I'm missing something. one way could matter reasonably certain case numbers way higher last recorded number significant proportion population immune. Amen brother miss friends, movies, cafes, people watching, going park go home crowded, visiting family, everything. Except commutes, maybe 34 44 according article. 

Downvote you! think same, US able export vaccines Canada countries, play diplomacy donations, even allow tourists get vaccine. Great times ahead, hope make it. I'm honestly surprised happen often. get fake ID, claim insurance. thought one would force law enforcement officer wear one people would back Ya vaccine absolutely nothing all. Completely useless protection wears significantly day... 75 let’s say? people get sick die didn’t get booster? Yes. unethical play games people’s lives don’t data. Time tell! differentiate truly asymptomatic cases pre-symptomatic. difference huge. day symptom onset, viral load near peak. Asymptomatic people peak much lower. 

Both asymptomatic pre-symptomatic people less likely quarantining taking extreme precautions, group high viral load (presymptomatic) drives high portion overall transmission. asymptomatic cases lower viral load even conditions less likely transmit. science tells us far.

So person right, saying odds study. Totally. also truckers. people work warehouses. food manufacturers. utilities workers. Garbage pick up. Gasoline stations. Janitors. Police. Farmers ranchers. Medical researchers. ... ""We've tried nothing we're ideas! Oh well, guess suffer another year without seeing family!""

Far high planned supply, although JnJ may increase that. supply support 4M day, even reserved 2nd doses. Zoom classes suck, perspective... students America either full-time partially attending school person, something like parents comfortable kids currently attending classes. I’m comparing states. overall average means places like Texas average entire country. Cases Canada US obviously down, example, almost 60%. (Cases ~15% Canada, 50, btw.) 

It’s never good idea call trend 1 week data. need several weeks get accurate reflection what’s actually happening. 

We look last spring see similar falls illness. knew first couple months winter would bad fall got closer spring. That’s seasonal pandemics work. ... health care workers likely come contact at-risk groups.

They vaccinated strictly protect themselves, work with. Wow that’s deep, I’m going thinking worked POTS? Yes, that’s exactly right! can’t speak small towns, Tampa Bay, mask wearing inside businesses completely normal thing do. Sure, you’ll see stray jerk mask handful nose riders, people know it’s simple ask. 

People volition stores enforce rule. say asthma shit? Seems way harder get caught way especially considering person giving shots gonna realize holding arm 70 year old...wild thought California much pronounced decline past couple weeks. doubting double masking effective, wondering required?

I think late, solution benefits everyone. fun waiting mRNA vaccines, then. I'll disagree there. family necessarily need be, teachers, bus drivers, lunch room workers need fully vaccinated. Whilst link referred article linked AZ vaccine, comments quote direct response transmission retirement home Pfizer used transmission seen. interest discussing AZ vaccine relevant.

I dispute data available Israeli studies, I'm quoting article saying transmission still possible within settings. way therefore useless. No. virus incredibly high survival rate. flu higher IFR COVID people 50. lockdowns completely unacceptable. mask mandates. solution stratified age group. giving Pfizer. They've given az Pfizer far orders vaccine candidates. following fall/winter, enough people vaccinated make virus non-issue :) Much better testing Canada. live, can’t get test even wanted one. gloomy one think reflect following fall/winter. 

You mean well vast majority people vaccinated we'll 100% normal? statistically speaking, grocery store workers young less likely die virus.

It's fucking complicated. Workers left cannon fodder, left prioritising older people medical conditions first Looking way turn masks issue personal risk assessment 11 months isn’t worth 

Why not? I'm proposing better solution issue still First, masks don’t offer 100% protection, better safe sorry 

Yes, obviously, relate point? saying double mask one party less effective single masks two Second, drastically changing protocols point would cause backlash confusion 

Not really drastic change though. basically saying ""we've discovered way masks protect user, longer mandating mask wearing want take personal best option stick works remaining 9-12 months pandemic, that’s everyone wearing masks. 

Right, know working well far. People wearing useless neck gaiters, wearing masks nose, wearing one all. current mandate works theory, 100% participation. proposal works practice gives everyone choice consequences based decision. would expect different? flip side, winter weather preventing people going could help slow transmission. 120,000/180,000 exactly targeting eligibility.

I mean, really tell whole story.

While definitely agree vaccine plans perfect sounds like guy receiving level priority, think bit presumptuous say open all.

That county may higher rate elderly (and high priority individuals) national average. Maybe county higher rate non-acceptance national average. 

Nationally, we've put first vaccinations like 15% people. realm possibility county double national average. So, let's say 30%. we'll say 40% eligible people said no. would put us 50% population already worked through, 30k current phase work. opening everyone, tripled elgible folks. Put light looks like targeted it?

It seem bit crazy area could already worked 50% population, 2/3 population eligible vaccination surprise crazy demographics county would shoved lot people high priority. concerned there's going mandates/laws/fines wearing masks flu season, worry. There's barely political capital/will get action serious pandemic, there's way anyone going seriously push flu season mask mandates.

If upset notion seeing mask public ever again, suggest get perspective. someone sick cold/flu go out, would hope they'd considerate others wear mask. Comparing charts new cases Israel chart new cases UK, UK significant steeper reduction new cases. it’s three!!! EU Union states. US, states EU rights states US. :)

My reply excuse EU ban vaccine export till EU fully vaccinated. 15th birthday March 8th. managed avoid lockdown birthday last year, I’m hoping avoid one year.

It doesn’t even need anything big, I’d like see couple friends grandma something. parents grandparents vaccinated, don’t really see reason not.

I can’t wait get high flintstones vitamins without scrutiny! Publix month now. That’s people getting here. FL DOH also, theory. it’s total mystery actually get appointment. understand it’s essentially lottery system them, knows. don’t know anyone shot them. forgot add every single 65+ person list, 50 million people, overlap working category they're retired.

Even variants eventually produce immune escape vaccine antibodies they'll still going effective severe disease. Immune systems prepped strains. going COVID-21 COVID-22 every bit equally bad starting That's good hear!

I've getting suggestions links lately too! wearing masks another year. matter Biden says. say need wear masks fucking 2040, doesn’t mean that’s reality play out. They're working it. Already 500000 less cases counting. Absolutely, know ‘lockdown’ small part equation. There’s many factors US failed pretty miserably them. We’re 2-3 months away almost everyone access vaccine essential workers April. Protecting vulnerable elderly priority number one would rather gamble limited sample data wit dosing regimen. Lockdowns work...if they're done right. like mask going much wear nose chin. Kuwait also really young population though median age 29. Compare Italy’s 46 US’s 39.  think president told people drink bleach there's nothing discuss. Oh no, didn’t come across argumentative. 

I concerned reinfection since cases started popping summer - didn’t know norm outliers.

Reinfections occur, you’re absolutely right. also seeing longer lasting immunity quite number people well, seen studies. even studies aren’t showing 100% immunity 8 months. 

I’m convinced infection *tends* confer *some* meaningful protection medium-term, question remains, much protection? Watch get downvoted.  used think that, feel lot people actually would want live type society. That’s frustrating. roll bad that, cities, people get vaccines hospital employees. personally know two people hospital admin 100% remote vaccinated. Read sub enough see plenty folks (usually downvoted oblivion). I've also seen subs, like r/politics. actually heard anyone know IRL sentiment GF telling friends basically stating planning another year hardcore distancing, regardless happens. 

It's weird personally understand it, definitely exists ""Sure X horrible thing, remember time horrible thing?"" like excuse behavior.

That’s happening, media spreading crazy conspiracy theory response USA’s media spreading crazy conspiracy theory.

Man think least downgrade regular mask, that’s gotta uncomfortable. cases aren’t really ticking lol. There’s lot fluctuation British Columbia doesn’t report cases every single day, days days don’t. know relatively healthy people mid 30s got month ago live Trump county signed get wastage prevention list local hospital. county got enough doses medical staff 75+ residents many refused cleared entire wait list people actually wanted it.

Meanwhile, nearby city neighboring county, even started vaccinating 65+ teachers made far rollout supply issues.

That's keeps motivated mask distance. think ignore danger virus, *at all*. 

Just decided distance follow rules, mean get make decision people too. Respect choices, even they're *terrible* choices. *so ignorant, purpose, spite me* there's nothing it. people chosen stop distancing they're vaccinated, that's fine, long respect people's choices.

The virus made lab. That's conspiracy theory garbage, know it. Even made lab, what? cares? you? humanity, ability fight virus, people who've lost loved one? Nothing spread hate. Give up.

About - I'm ""anti-lockdown"" ""pro-lockdown"". US, think we've ""lockdown"", we've restrictions, minimal ones that. lockdown like NZ China, think we'd better place (fewer deaths). hand I'm *totally* convinced effective people think. encourage people ""follow rules"" guidelines whatever.

Please assume troll argue conservative subs I'm conservative. I'll get banned eventually. **Can vaccinated people spread virus?**

Any answer get either ""yes"" ""no"" wrong, now. ""maybe, probably not"", going way long time.

In order answer question scientifically, would require ""challenge study"" vaccinated unvaccinated people deliberately exposed virus see transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns deliberate exposure prevent us performing studies humans. reason vaccine trials took long, can't deliberately infect people see need hospitalization die. 

(EDIT: Well, looks like [spoke studies hamsters, results looked pretty bad. able spread it. hamsters greet touching noses like time. Humans really (do you?). similar studies monkeys results look really good.

Also, notice reputable person talking subject always says ""may able spread"", ""maybe"", ""we know if"". that's small chance vaccinated people able spread virus. big chance. Doctors, scientists, regulators careful language subject, would argue they're careful. said, say ""vaccinated people cannot spread virus"", find situations vaccinated people spread virus, would end worse hedge while. least me, way they're framing seems pretty reasonable, put shoes.

That said, seem [saying I've Said saying. Saying Said?

**Additional Thoughts/Cool likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

[Delayed second doses might least though evidence mRNA vaccine trials suggest 6 weeks better least acceptable. problem wait longer second dose, therefore, full protection. says maximum interval doses, [Pfizer says 6 

[A happy may prevent severe [mRNA vaccines 100% SA variant, *doesn't* [mean we'll definitely need mutation analogy:**

The spike protein coded 3,831 base pairs. mean?

Well, like lego sculpture 3,831 words instructions build it, writer super-detailed explaining motion piece.  

In analogy, immune system makes lego pieces (antibodies) attach pair exposed bumps lego sculpture. We'll say 40 pairs exposed example.

A variant instructions change one words. Sometimes photocopier instructions page gets tiny smudge. could really bad sometimes, especially critical word phrase, like ""left"" ""repeat six times"" description particularly detailed lego piece. Color might always matter, size would.

Out 3,831 words, many change much every one 40 spots longer there? probably lot.

But wait, many words change make whole sculpture really different, work sculpture anymore? Really many they're right spots, right? variants suck viruses; rare mistake would make instructions *better*.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty minor.

**Booster questions think about, answers**

(note: there's difference ""boost"" ""booster"" needs understood.)

(also, what's term mixture sequences, heterogenous? doubt term overthinking?)

(also also, I'm convinced we're definitely going need boosters, fun think about.)

Could booster shot replace second dose prime/boost regimen?

Should booster shot use one sequence mRNA (or identical spike proteins), both/multiple?

For future vaccines, sequence/spike prime/boost different? four spikes/sequences, would make sense two each, four each?

How much trust mutation modeling here? anticipate future mutations include them? good enough yet?

Do need give non-booster doses people recovered infection?

Could ""stretch"" doses mRNA booster priming vaccine that's easier manufacture, maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), boost mRNA booster? Could better faster prime current mRNA sequence boost updated ChAdOx1? vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing infection, subsequent variant exposed broaden immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). they'll good broad immunity variety variants, seems likely indication catch spread virus well future. thing happens someone vaccinated exposed new variant. immunity broadened strengthened subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. remember, many people less likely spread virus, pretty unlikely reduced level spread sufficient sustain virus way seen past year. variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing mind changed new information though, take gospel. 

Tips clarifying terms/language/understanding appreciated. miss something could help people? Please let know!

Oh goodness. like read comments something...  But, that's immune system ever worked so, give garbage data. infection first days tells absolutely nothing vaccine's effectiveness, community transmission rates, maybe people's changes behavior post vaccination. Looks like [NYT now.

The best links starred. * U.S., considering hardly anyone ever wore masks past flu seasons, pretty easy rebuttal someone freaks wearing mask future normal flu season ask show pics masked prior 2020. shut pretty quick.

Also, personal experience, biggest tantrums freak outs I've seen public anti-maskers politely asked put mask due policies. seen lot pro-mask types aggressive public, I'm sure happens. think likely scenario lab research coronaviruses bats SARS MERS things China worried next one. probably even isolated Covid-19 local bat population. makes look suspicious, even source outbreak, look like are. 

The way China comes side investigation finds Covid 19 lab certain get blamed pandemic smoking gun dude making pig ate bat whatever. that, smart play block investigation.

EDIT: ""the lab"" mean one China. Maryland lab stuff crazy BS. late pivot two one unfortunately. seem angry. Perhaps something else calm down. making sure people likely get hospitalized actually get fucking vaccine would reduce problem. Young/healthy people unlikely require hospitalization, at-risk populations much likely, millions at-risk people could vaccine already double dose policy.

I say anything order people vaccinated, simply way get enough people vaccinated achieve herd immunity. even evidence single dose ineffective even long term goal.

Why would expect be? long enough long term data. 

The clinical trials based upon two doses, moment robust evidence medium term relates protocol. simply ignorant think drastically reducing chance people likely require hospitalization change equation. Perhaps Pfizer/Moderna stock? Double money better half money, right?

I suggest change situation, R0 close 5 high proportion population needs vaccinated highly effective vaccine get R unity. That's basic mathematics. 

In context, extra effectiveness conferred second dose likely significant. Sat cried reading this. want dance (rescheduled) wedding. ❤️ ignorant world think factories China purely cost. India's labor cost way lower China's much younger population. yet vax centers closing due lack **supply**

(in places frozen over). feeling we’re going best get next door neighbors closest trade partners good condition soon possible. “only” 38 million people good healthcare infrastructure think you’ll able catch fairly quickly soon supply catches up. dont dog fight dont know id say 4/10 people covid. main question whether countries extremely slow vaccine rollout (specifically looking you, Canada...) implement not. think people anti vaxers, probably anti lockdowns saying personally take vaccine lnt anti vax.

Vaccines miracle we're blessed them, said there's point getting vaccine young healthy. Vaccines prevent major cases people heavy complications due covid. stop covid

Most people think vaccines magical solution make world normal again. Nothing ever again, Covid remain atleast 10-20 years need learn live it, way living good? ready live 10 years like this? True barred WTO relegated back decades ago. 

They covered virus economic gain. fuck off. Mr Burns: ""Remember, forever."" good advice, thanks Uh, stops symptomatic cases happening well? insane question... Yes, referring immediately shot, possibly first 48 hours

That's said time get second shot Goes show know everything dead wrong. Also need understand numbers important time goes on. data becomes VALUABLE time progresses. people providing data time study data = better results. see 10 year studies vaccines time. normally study participants data many many years deploying vaccine masses. Covid short term data volatile see fluctuations. Long term data better unfortunately needed protection sooner later. Thats worry risks involved vaccines distributed quickly. basically still testing ""At risk""  Lol imagine started swine flu US, China wanted come investigate origins. Fucking lol would say whatever, clean situation looked like natural inevitability negligence. Lol, added ""everywhere"" thinking I'd get Florida reply. Hope great trip. It’s statistical model estimates many additional people 1 single infection go infect. recently deprecated site still old methodology finding R0 bottom well linking sites see current data. wondering:

* Miami

Yeah..... that. can't wait outdoor dining viable again.

If can't get vaccinated June, want still relatively safe fun friends. I'm listening experts said Israel, highest per capita vaccination rates . Nobody wants sit car 10 hours like Florida. fucking disaster. remember reading swore 30% effective first dose.

Haven't seen one yet. I've seen like bazillion different cynical know there’s pressure get vaccine people, influencing studies?

That's exactly thinking. seems push pretty much everywhere give first dose. almost feels they're trying justify inconsistent numbers show they're higher [original Anecdotally, sister brother law got first shot Pfizer two weeks later got covid.

Yeah, relatives friends got Covid first shot too. yeah, agree. Looks good, would suggest talking advisors estimate true level population immunity natural infection. 

Anywhere 2.5-5.0 amount confirmed cases total infections. 

Also make sure account infected vaccinated double count know voted. opinion entirely reasonable. Canada's issue never in-country distribution, getting vaccines imported all. really change much front. Exactly, you’re buying season exotic fruit/veg it’s obviously going expensive. actually take long hard look much fresh produce costs vs ready made take away food realise lot money saved. Also cooking therapeutic better use time sat front TV eating shit dinner. I'm replying you. ""travel entirely wrong"" ""seasonality entirely wrong"" equally incorrectly. right arguing someone wrong. much depends person's expertise. One widely quoted contrarians NZ actually epidemiologist. sounds credible. turns spent entire career studying effects dietary sugar. point? made comment, felt need ask sources gave First dose, huh? *james franco meme* degree uncertainty studies like this. boy, educaitional system really failed teach basic concepts science one hand Great Power rival bad increases risk major war astronomically. Compared proxy war fought China, Iraq War would look minor comparison.

However foreign power offering criticism give motivation commit improvements American society. Soviet Union going “You Lynch black people” whenever criticized boom Civil Rights movement. I've following Bloomberg counter. No, definitely didn't, yesterday's back normal range. There’s claim specific protection value, it’s “very high” line offered protection.

Before vaccinations, retirement homes ravaged COVID, one resident tested positive , entitle residents also tested resulting getting back positive.

On specific case, first resident caught due routine test, without showing symptoms. resident prior contact anyone outside. infection route start somewhere else. never spread entire population before.

This shows vaccine “extremely high” efficacy , although cannot obviously take hard value it. welcome risk intramuscular injection according nurse gave flu vaccine. air introduced vascular system becomes issue. lie #1, using outdated source:

Israel paying 28$ per shot, source. 

[The EU paying $14.76 per That's 2 times much. correct 2-3 times much EU paid billions development 

That's lie, EU pay billions development size order Israel can't get physically Moderna US 

Stop lying please Israel received Moderna vaccines [on Jan even European, EU Switzerland, production line even started working [Jan doses came US production.

You obviously heated obsession irrational hate towards Israel, facts immaterial you. result advice would nobody wear masks. nobody likes them, give everyone out: ""I'm vaccinated"", everyone stop wearing lie challanged. may outlier got covid immediately second dose pfizer vaccine, three weeks first. symptoms severe though, runny nose, coughing fatigue still able get outside stuff like fishing (at places one else around) talking previously received passive antibody data safety efficacy mRNA COVID-19 vaccines persons received monoclonal antibodies convalescent plasma part COVID-19 treatment.

That previously infected. Unless referring another section. hate teachers? know single teacher's union said want members vaccinated, must continue zoom lessons in. posing statement saying educators slacking past 12 months, basically extended sabbatical. That's like complaining take-out closed restaurant luke-warm steamed, get shots better jobs! Yikes!

As rest it, good luck. two locations bought couple freezers around $10k pop? single medications cost $20k+ month. Obviously pharmacy taking profit, costs exorbitant cost business RX world. Also, we're even getting fact taking profit administering vaccines subsidized US Govt. mention, plenty medications still need types freezers actually expand ability mediations supply now. trials ended, don’t end fall 2022.

I'm going March can't wait. Thank god winter ending soon. mostly stuck inside covid shitty cold temperature absolutely miserable time. Here’s warm weather increasing vaccination rates! guess change closer get fall. rules written stone. problem is, people shitty succumb confirmation bias. CDC says ""you're transmissible vaccinated, return life normal"" two things guaranteed:

1. non-vaccinated people, wanting 2nd class citizens, find dubious reason go back normal also. remember people believe crazy things like flat-earth makes feel good
2. going back. tell millions people go back normal, 0 chance update advice based new evidence. people reject new evidence want go back lockdown. thus, need high confidence release masses go party.

in perfect world, could follow evidence rapidly change behavior directions. live perfect world. someone something right, reasonable, justified.

The strategy right, regardless measure 'risk' believe involved.  irk. I'm assuming Canada too? Ontario? Correct. think ""we know"" thing. Like, test vaccine trials unless people symptomatic, therefore know vaccinated people asymptomatic spreaders, therefore possibility could happen, therefore recommend change nothing know. However, would obviously fly face entire history vaccines. I'm sure people concerned stigma opinion seem major reasoning behind it. give kid apple? Banana? Baby carrots? Pretzels? Raisins?

At least JVAC thought, based data prior vaccines, likely would play out. has, vindicated.

Your question 'benign' described, thats talking about. Oh wow, ground zero this. I'm glad made helping keeping people informed posting here. Fair enough, back January February 2020, symptomatic otherwise ill. ended getting sick cold really really difficult find second appointment. No, asymptomatic last summer .  MIL antibody test last summer negative lied us told us positive (We NYC). trying guilt us seeing them, fil told us next day negative them. So, really trust anything say. Breaking return normalcy US. predictions following commonplace everywhere (with mandatory masks)

1. Outdoor parties (eg. Rooftop bars)
2. Safe indoor parties (20+ people)
3. Indoor concerts events (think Comic con)
4. Packed movie halls/broadway honestly think Indian workers better standards living Chinese workers? LOL mean, mask wearing simple preventative measure probably positive effect reducing spread. time totem people make be. people getting religious it, cross ward away vampires something. Either way, it'll interesting see history looks back this.. especially policies science, lack thereof, behind much it.  Adherance shops public transport looks good area, least. people wear masks walk, give plenty space.

I think right balance. Pushing hard marginal gain makes people push back. want everyone acting way social pressure reinforcement. seen pandemic (we're close), keeping back pocket next China rant. said last summer likely happen. working vaccine, want introduce lot variables, said, ""Okay, know temperature keep stable, let's go work data storing higher temperature later on."" guess 'later on' here. Someone posted article days ago said 92% effective first dose. think 60% trials (sorry, actually probably triple mask safe. saying humanity lose war.

No smoking history, I'll check qualifications. Thank suggestions. yes, boyscouts going volunteer.  Nothing like 12 year olds poking arm! /sarcasm isn’t willpower issue. It’s money issue. nation slaves can’t afford quit lose healthcare.

I think willpower issue, think money plays role; however, think even education issue.

Most people idea healthy meal looks like people know count calories. top that, there's also ""healthy size"" lie many people bought believe, seen repeated people trust. virus sentient thing.

And somehow keeps outsmarting politicians :(  Well point binary thinking lead productive outcomes. wearing mask public selfish, yes. also single driver spread, either. really weird China this? can’t see US inviting foreign investigators country circumstances either. 

This seems like common response super powers. Seriously. Trump charged 400,000 murders Biden charged 100,000. Every single one deaths preventable Jacinda Arden president. guess 6 7 months US. think ball start rolling 2 3 months though. 

...Hopefully doesn’t age like milk. 95% effective making sterile Godawful critical thinking displayed here. benefits? fuck would CDC want drag out?

I've never understood people say evidence UK policy. There's doubt going save lives. remember right late 80s excuse Kroger used closing local stores butchers unionized.  far first time they've done this, repeat whole thing again. Sure there’s still quite bit vaccine administration done, even moved one dose regimen overnight.

Great see there’s evidence approach working well though! Thank you! nothing country address countries vaccine distribution decisions order vaccines.

.... heck? help countries less developed healthcare infrastructure *all time* diseases. people see, aside masks, following restrictions warm weather comes government able keep people going out.

Look happened last summer. Atleast hospital full ICU, means save managed get rid Kroger long time Texas, like roaches started crawling back neighborhoods.  Maybe stop again. No, decision made government agency pressure politicians. administering reduced efficacy vaccine regimen negative consequences, like increasing likelihood mutations reducing recipient’s ability obtain better vaccine later developing immunity vector.

-wall street execs point become worthwhile mass-vaccinate 1 dose follow later? 1 dose cuts serious complications fatalities then?

Canada, Phizer Moderna looking vaccinating 14.5M people end June. extend 2nd dose 3-4 months number becomes entire adult population getting single dose within next 3-4 months. Faster approved vaccines.  entire article posted comments hour left comment Sure. primary principle underpinning modern medicine “do harm”. theoretically could administering vaccines six months ago Phase 2 trials successful pretty good suspicion vaccines would work, (rightfully) didn’t - didn’t controlled studies proving efficacy. countries make pharmaceutical decisions based demonstrated evidence, hunches optimistic guesses.

The UK’s decision administer vaccines off-label dosage regimen could easily promoted additional development harmful strains applying evolutionary pressure virus, protection partial complete. still possibility decision approve lower-efficacy AZ vaccine may actually this.

There overwhelming pressure “do something” cases emergency, without evidence, isn’t always right move - situations like Pandemrix occurred past. One dose one shot. Presymptomatic vs Asymptomatic. 

Asymptomatic people, displaying symptoms life infection, unlikely spread virus.

Presymptomatic people, may display symptoms 3-14 days infected, still spread virus (we believe) badly someone fully symptomatic. 

The reason thing spreads quickly presymptomatic spread. That's lockdowns based on. vaccine ability make asymptomatic infected, unlikely spread. hope helps! North Dakota bad! say, I’m lucky guess lol. got time winter break too. hard get vaccine site can't afford car, top head long think mask mandates stay place become ""recommendations""? telling deal 2 days aches, pain, fever, swollen lymph nodes  Well, know, limited supply moment.

Everyone already access essential workers ages. me. 4 weeks exactly. Anywhere 3-6 weeks found equally effective told, able read myself. Well lot business operate lot places still buy them. called international supply chain. Lockdowns? No. Restrictions? Yea.

Lockdowns used hospital capacity threatened, right now.

Lockdowns cause far many side effects asking people anything besides grocery shop work vaccines absurd. wife got sick flu/covid like respiratory virus. thought one two sure... fever, cough, horrible horrible body aches, fatigue.

Water good too. Developing countries need water. Going second point, also far fewer PPE shortages better practices ventilator use. Yep. Also worth noting, FDA didn’t disagree policy, wasn’t data support it. studies coming various vaccines, hopefully give FDA enough insights suggest delaying 2nd dose (up 12 weeks) OK. summer? feeling lot things open something new tiers abolish entirely. 

Schools already new threshold. outdoor sports. Pretty soon it'll another thing, another thing, yet another thing bypass current tier system, tier system mostly void.

Pretty ready done tiers soon. think ready yet personally, damn tiers hard get through. mean, kinda one people, guess. fear irrationality, parent people saying shit kids adults vaccinated. hermits, one cautious friend groups. But, supposed go packed museum summer put unvaccinated child risk? masking going enough? know kiddos catch often, seems big jump playing outside pod ok to: let's cram trampoline park bunch people. know going struggle seem guidelines follow. fear one going want wear mask vaccinated people wear one also get vaccinated.

Take one step further, there's narrative media ""R*d states vs. bl*e states"" comes COVID really clean. Look deaths per capita state mixed ""r*d states"" ""bl*e states""... importantly, mixed strictness lockdowns. Gottlieb point stressed demand issue sooner think. ""freedom"" pre COVID already gone permanently.

People compliant freedom sight. take sight away hell breaks loose muted 24hours posts positive articles reputable sources removed. post certain sites like foxnews filtered review. sub really shows colors that. username definitely checks effing chance. offense, flat wrong think mandatory masks another year. may make another month current rate things. Whats point?

Is point physically possible poor obese? one saying isn't. 

The point show obesity highly correlated poverty anyone interested solving obesity epidemic needs look root issues, patterns, systemic causes, treat individual moral failing. Remember harmless honest comments deleted though didnt break rules, comments beneath mysteriously downvoted, speaking truth? added article could get posted here- I've tried post things exactly peachy rainbows vaccine got muted article removed. See ya. probably right. mom lives county. told earlier today people pissed traveling 2+ hours get vaccine areas state. 


Fortunately, able set appointments aunts beginning January.  Exactly this. evidence vaccines stop transmission least significantly reduce it, hardly death hospitalization, I’m sorry kiss ass still want wear mask “social distance”. No. notice sub in. matter context want present from. bad. nice day planning differently?  Exactly - anything praising anywhere. without posting prob allowed here. **one two more** people group gotten covid, effectiveness rating would decreased significantly.

Seriously? ridiculous. kind scientist would publish type data? papers actually peer reviewed? I'm guessing not. I'm assuming trial data reliable (or least would hope). THANK YOU. People keep talking CDC says risks known, ignoring CDC also advises pregnant women able get vaccine choose, risks unknown nature vaccine makes unlikely risks (it's live virus pregnant women routinely given vaccines without live virus, vaccine cross nucleus cells, dissolves quickly probably even pass placenta).

But know sure risky? Covid. Pregnant women likely get severe Covid, ventilators, die. fetuses likely born prematurely--and premie survive, mean lifelong complications result. prolonged fever first trimester (like say Covid) cause neurological tube defects miscarriage. Serious question y'all. long willing wear mask for?

For I'm vaccinated mandate place. Unless business I'm going asks to, I'm argue minimum wage employee get paid enough deal it.   specifics mind random accusations? Total, then. No, absolutely not.

First all: giving one shot without evidence dumb. Even evidence says seems like bad idea, unknown months ago.
Now giving one shot might something consider.

Secondly: giving one shot might help virus mutate. dont want virus ""learns"" first shot immune even people got both. may suffering anyone really knows. know people got fine entire time. know people gotten shot suffered without covid days week various reasons. think media reporting adverse effects reason - sub likes block anything negative them. I'm hopeful work I'm super careful everything I'm hearing first hand read. Sorry source cause word mouth issues. No. little irrelevant go detail sub cause I'm talking stuff virus related. 3-4 months. way people locked summer. Good. state logistics get given next week start getting ready we'll many new doses every week. numbers from? comment history tells everything need know bias.  road signs ""m"" miles Get Chile. one Canada preclude anything vaccinated. you’re unsure “double dosing” ask doctor access one. I’m Kansas. hope right! folks talking bell pepper weren’t talking bell peppers. message healthy food expensive less convenient fast food. 

You correct things set equal, willpower would thing left. that’s is. Poor communities likely food deserts people within likely work multiple jobs, everything feeds one another. It’s basically inextricable.  Yes, I'm exaggerating, really needs understood.

For personal risk, hospitals, TTI resource allocation etc., incidence important.

But can't keep going like this: Lockdown till cases low, one improvements keep reduction place despite people becoming careless, contrary, even relaxed state TTI last time, goes again, uncoordinated response follows, lockdown again. think pretty clear think. sounds like really weird thing vaccine. Individual models vary, overall method simple. estimate serial interval 5 days (not 14), decline new infections 40% 5 day period would indicate R=0.6. inaccuracy comes know infection days cases, usually assign R value based today's cases, would estimate new infections 10-14 days ago. 

The US 7-day average new cases dropped 96.5k 74.0k last 5 days, implying R~0.77. Since January 13 (when cases first started dropping) we've fallen rolling 251k case average, R~0.84 timeline. far tell R still dropping US.

For UK appears rising though, see 0.6 possible. rolling case average fallen 13% (R~0.87) last 5 days, compared dropping 24% (R~0.76) January 25-30.

Certainly models going advanced try avoid problems using 7-day weekly average (which avoids day-of-week problems cases get reported weekends, still 3-day-weekend problems). overall method Well, hope testing vaccines use show that. then, study used anything regarding them. ""I'll fucking it"" - Ron DeSantis - Probably No, seen Democrats pretend hoax. you? I'm entirely sure though - thats small amount people controlled location medications play. common public individual may fair well know yet. also talking taking something every 6months gather may may able handle new variants. much proof working would love see yet. I'm hopeful I've gotten family gotten shots wait see game still cautious masking up, staying away others, joining large events yet anyway. Nationalism hell drug covid denial. know upsetting, last sentence literal covid denial.

""The pandemic want over."" No, want vaccine trust people pushing them. fix things like [private clinical trial [lack diversity [unjustified [blanket immunity pharmaceutical that's going change. point know Fauci going answer every question. open mouth. pick cautious pessimistic possible answer. Eh, limited anymore. I’m pretty close planning trip there, live lax state lol Absence evidence evidence absence. vaccines cannot prevent transmission degree, would making them? say “it’s supposed stop getting it’s supposed stop hospitals filling up!”, working mass vaccination? we’re supposed mask never socialize again, even bother shot?

I allowed hug father perform (I’m singer) 7 months. don’t get expect people live like eternity someone don’t know might get live months. People need realistic end goal. That’s “denying facts”, that’s using facts create realistic outcomes (which change time). One thing I've learned pretty quickly New York worst day still New York. day got breakfast tiny Dominican place block house Queens, went walked around Central Park snow day. Today got pulled snowball fight bunch strangers Washington Square. We're still wearing masks shit, swear life starting feel better every day. AZ also 2 dose vaccine Wow 120M end March 3 million per day! Yeah communism works way: books. can't work better California supermajority Florida Florida... work real humans. Exactly... many diseases simply live economically worth it, worth time, deal them. 

Covid current state threat life economy, happy sacrifice time money order control it.

Once vaccine rolled out, threat Covid worth time money (aka lockdowns) deemed control fall category diseases  vaccines use aren’t similar one. 

They're pretty similar ways matter. 

There's almost established adult vaccine delay weeks doses. typically months years. that's immune system works. 

If gap booster short likely going build memory less effectively. want response booster involve immune memory rather primarily remaining antibodies etc responding first dose. help reinforce development memory. Ok mi short version miles? Wait. “76% efficacy symptomatic coronavirus infection three months first dose”

And “Efficacy found 81% longer interval 12 weeks first second dose” “compared 55% efficacy six-week gap”

How add up... efficacy when?  saying wait 6 weeks 2nd shot efficacy goes down??? Higher education testing returning consistently less 1% positive tests since started tracked, working point state actually 2 percent positive rates: one higher education one without. rates falling statewide, likely safe ease bit. Lockdown magic silver bullet. clearly worked China (though obviously cost iron fisted dictatorship). US attempts lockdown joke.

From I've read, USA also badly failed contact tracing. Narrator: summer 4 days first dose, that’s unfortunately expectable. don’t care foreseeable future certain settings — hospital, doctors offices, etc. 

I don’t plan mask I’m getting together fully vaccinated family members, privately, (I’m also vaccinated). 

I’m willing wear mask voluntarily public cases drop locally vaccines available everyone, plus bit time get immunity. I’d really rather voluntary point, though. Mandates lift 60+ vaccinated hospitals good shape imo. lol scientists base decisions data, reddit hyperbole. AZ apply approval data FDA going turn someone reddit says ""vaccine bad"". Numbers stagnating projected start rising within next two-three weeks.

The predictions remain locked throughout year looking less ridiculous every day. same. hope don’t end getting J&amp;J. stability data lower temperature first, additional stability data higher temperature.

Stability data part submission health authorities, definitely (i.e. original storage conditions data-based, precaution). news, think longer considered order inappropriate discuss return normalcy soon.

I think order time now. Even Fauci talking it. Except isn’t true all. CDC estimates 83.1 total coronavirus infections US. that’s 25% Americans form immunity ALONE. I've never run problem it, realize issue. case every vaccine existence? I'm sure understand premise. Ah thanks, higher thought. lot reasons this, biggest accountability low rates turnover amongst federal workers creating lack diverse thought competence.

I feel talking point crushed last 4 years. Many career officials fired favor (young old) upstarts firebrands. government became far less competent far less efficient. Expertise thing value, need defended. even hamstrung previous admin court cases simply competent understand case law make policies could last even 4 years technical breaks law easy iron implementation. 

The basic problem one political party runs idea government functional, incentivized make less functional, half nation cheers. vax wars.

&amp;#x200B;

12 week global lockdown now. Mandate signage effective people want wear one. Sure was, sis get downvoted tho? know someone got Covid two weeks first shot. However symptoms incredibly mild, someone elderly million serious health issues, including diabetes. shudder think outcome would least first shot. think that's point. Florida less control vaccine doses getting shipped can't reroute ""special"" clinics. outbreak German care home 4 days vaccination quarter residents killed. go quickly. California getting 1.5M vaccines next week, likely following week. California 300k teachers. teacher vaccines arrive, take two weeks earmark first dose. case every vaccine existence. Vaccine available general public low hospitalizations area. Meantime, peace, love health you. I’m Florida. 

So bad Brazilian variant? Anyone quality link? Thanks formula need change, needed complete stability study. front line workers who’ve find alternate means year, really think they’d rather kids go back month get vaccine themselves? they’re exposed work exposed whatever kids bring home too? Like arguments make sense everyone entire year one month summer vacation (for vast majority California schools) instead vaccinating frontline workers doesn’t help anything. They’ll needing find childcare soon end May anyway.

What need always needed money handle childcare still need money summer. doesn’t fix issue regardless trust one-shot studies. findings inconsistent I've heard many people got Covid weeks first shot. German citizen still enter reason, register quarantine 10 days (5 negative test). I'm trying say even vaccine still axiom infection. expressing concern. take way? Let people travel. vaccine passport, quarantine 2 weeks upon arrival. do, don't. What's problem? Well get together 20 people next weekend, statistically speaking, 2 20 would protection. That's two months vaccinations, including comparatively slow first month. Three months mid May. point, would probably 8 20. Maybe 9 10. Mid June, probably 12 maybe 14. point feel comfortable? probably would then, partially cases hospitalizations super low. She’s “sorry”, per article she’s still leaving door open second shot. 

What do? 

Make example removing eligibility letting get already (which probably excellent given Pfizer/Moderna)? allow get second shot enjoys even protection?

Interesting times.  40 million people face eviction still. hopeful. :) long still works offers level protection... point is, long at-risk vaccinated, *doesn't matter* when/if hit herd immunity. cares spreading long nobody becoming seriously ill it? issue longevity immunity lasting long 1 dose versus 2. I’d rather stay 2 dose route. Yes agree...

I thinking something different mis-remembering, hence edited original post. I'm beginning think half states country dropped mask mandate end March. want sound uncivil longer respect sort opinion. boot licking. Many folks, especially front-line workers, depend school childcare day. study ran December comment variants concluded previous infection reduces risk infection 94% pretty comparable leading vaccines. would opinions like yours!   moderna? assume it’s similar? mean agree you. think way sell lot people find 2nd dose unpleasant 1st. don’t mandate one dose hope give option skipping 2nd. I’m CA they’re clearly holding back 2nd doses. would big help direct doses 1st doses. Depression changes brain could definitely cause symptoms, reality symptoms still exist people catching covid, genuinely disrupting lives, even psychosomatic still need proper treatment get better (e.g. CBT). Moreover, true, fact could develop psychosomatic fatigue Covid something propagated. monster guy is. It’s great don’t live food desert many communities access supermarkets grocery stores buy canned goods. Access problem.

This anecdotal. problem that’s present documented decades. Pfizer's clinical trials? difference 94% 95% big probably insignificant. Crazy, following restrictions despite vaccinated want support businesses decisions run counter best evidence epidemiology. 

I run based contingencies. Positivity rate, vaccination status present, change 7 day case average determines whether modify behavior relaxed stricter. poster troll Low effort troll. Thanks temporary shot adrenaline, you. No. one credible advocating ignoring costs suggesting restrictions economic social impact. Absolutely one. 

Likewise, one ignoring public health benefits restrictions. 

It can't simply boiled ""restrictions impacted negatively therefore must go"" ""I mind restrictions lets keep longer need to"". Neither productive. I’m fine long it’s necessary (there’s mandates, businesses job requires it, household vaccinated). that, I’m far less inclined so. disgusting. lived Ireland know sort country is. Successive governments done shit improve healthcare standards want people deal consequences. one strictest lockdown regimes Europe help shit, yet insist insanity. glad Swedish need live madness. hated first got used it. price pay sense normalcy. good job spacing masks etc never felt vulnerable.  olds vaccinated. Poor communities plenty access canned goods. problem affording whatever food want huge part diet canned vegetables. RuneScape, nice. lockdowns never intended permanently reduce spread deaths. ""flatten curve"" means basically prolong it. number cases deaths, spread longer period time.

What talking about? Spreading cases longer period time absolutely reduces deaths. everyone forgetting hospitals reaching capacity? hospital capacity, deaths. It’s South African variant, anyone wondering. able legally it? Many places now. IMO, able safely others vaccinated? That’s much riskier indoors others weigh risks. conversation intellectual level. way. Get us vaccinated we'll go back. Gavin getting one right. 5 years old... crybaby. tons free resources ask seek out. Many schools give tablets, laptops, hotspots need. BFF lived shelter last year young kids skip beat school. one speak say need help. school help go another. friend moved 3 states living shelters. give there's help. used work state run program utilized due people asking help seeking help. Low income families got good seek help. Trust county cancelled appointments. Exactly, every place I've seeing said distributing half could capacity, hold supply. Well great, get ton backlogged supply - finally ramp vaccine sites full capacity make sure stay efficient. Especially vaccine output continuing increase coming weeks. grandparents CVS vaccine appointments got cancelled due ice/snow storm Texas. many people werent able go vaccines expired. However, called grandparents told go right rushed got vaccinated😀🥳 good way sell software part difficult? Yeah get tested. Incubation time average 5 days. start getting infectious 2 days exhibiting symptoms. Testing negative 5 days exposure means likely stay negative, typically viral load high enough detect PCR test 4-5 days exposure . Yep I'm wearing one get vaccine whenever people stop wearing one general. think mask mandate expires March 5th unlikely get renewed. edited post think it’s incorrect. 

Here’s example study found now: total 43,548 participants underwent randomization, 43,448 received injections: 21,720 BNT162b2 21,728 placebo. 8 cases Covid-19 onset least 7 days second dose among participants assigned receive BNT162b2 162 cases among assigned placebo; BNT162b2 95% effective preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 97.6). 

8/162 yields 95%

If “one two” people would 10/162 94%. last time went supermarket cans corn green beans something like 70 cents. get canned food incredibly cheaply. Everyone seems want use specific things comparing time cost fast, bad food vs healthy food.

It's like people always say things like ""well spend 2 hours cooking food spend 20 minutes picking fast food."" Like, seriously? make tuna sandwich less $2. feed kid english muffin eggs price. That's go-to breakfast. Takes 10 minutes make.

I think really need educate people whole idea anything healthy expensive seems paralyze people. concern people thinking it’s soon get vaccine. know area Tampa location set in. It’s underserved area lot ways, think chose great location.

It’s complete opposite governor’s stunt rich zip codes Manatee county. I’m glad FEMA targeting people likely impacted covid, people likely vote current governor. there's still pandemic raging on, yeah. yoghurt containing probiota also beneficial effect. limiting zip code areas too? seniors parts county, makes sense locate forbid seniors county going there. ""That kind thing""? mean normalcy? Yeah, weird folks want get back right?  creating arbitrary criteria impossible enforce large scale. decides whether 60+ year old work home?

Basing employer, vaccinated age 65+, reasonable verifiable. *know* certain people choice interact dozens hundreds people day. prioritize them. quite doable, actually.

Additionally, even going go age. going go health conditions, even less enforceable employer.  Makes happy think about. However case keep masks awhile longer rest restrictions least arduous prevent resurgence. 5 days since contact. contact brother symptoms tell get tested regardless day customer asked question, answered, pulled mask could HEAR better.

I dumbfounded lost train thought. Fortunately, realized stupidity pulled back up. Masks bother slightest guess I'll wear CDC says otherwise. not? would normal enough me. already feel safe everything want do. everyone else, they'll catch they're vaccinated latest South African UK variants? I've seen stuff they're 60% effective 2 weeks vaccinated? Maybe I'm way base vaccine % confusing nothing ok selfish global pandemic. could imagine becoming annual, similar annual flu vaccine. Maybe would even combined eventually. difficult predict. I'd say, close 100%. got married Nov. marry best friend? Yes. complete shitshow, yes. hardly look pictures nervous breakdown them. mini covid safe wedding, rescheduling 5 times done one knew fuck doing. Would recommend getting married Covid Highly probable guess know better! stop dog. keep saying can't get worse always We're gonna need bigger vaccine. vaccines? Chances family take scheduled vacation Disney World October without masks? need one else wants them... toss them. 

The assumption underpinned US vaccine effort “make rain”. Even meant funding ‘losers’. Paywall Lol since Boris johnson learn art micropipetting? Lol think we've found doppelganger grandparents got first vaccine last night! also happy relieved! Second one March 10! seen slow Canada's rollout been? That’s smart them. However got away first shot, tell staff got first dose day leftover.

Why go trouble disguising themselves, even that’s first time? Normal human social interaction? Really good considering many states impacted snow Except spread among children fairly low, spread children adult fairly low. lot depends community transmission. need get zero risk benefits schools opening (which immense) outweigh benefits remaining closed.

It's parents wanting deal kids, legitimate issues delaying school terms children's developments. especially true underprivileged kids. critical developmental periods kids' lives.

We can't set goal zero risk. always tradeoffs. JROTC legally military.

Do even understand context? know military. never said was. said unethical. 

Jesus Christ dude I'm done you. either really fucking dumb annoying troll. never said suggested that. making views?

Figured like taste medicine. Bet let ask this: arguing idea targeting children military recruitment unethical?  already approve current vaccines. weird way, seeing everyone thread dealing struggles incredibly comforting. U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA), least, clearly share EMA's objections, especially central question importance RNA integrity. website Nov. 20, wrote: ""FDA reviewed data submitted production vaccine determined manufacturing quality information compliant FDA's recommendations guidance emergency approval Covid 19 vaccines. FDA determined manufacturer submitted adequate information ensure quality compatibility vaccine exist approval emergency approval."" 

But vaccine produced Puurs facilities comment would Puurs Sweden's Filip Josephson French colleague Jean-Michel Race

They medical professionals Kubicki

He lawyer oppinion international experts working EMA matter again? Last summer also pushing another lockdown needed even advised people sue mild lockdown begin second wave Germany. applicable vaccines?

This fluid dynamics, yes: applicable everytime need extract fluids vial.

Just vaccine currently cheap, though, time needed apply procedure significantly expensive countries ordering additional vial...

...downturn: putting syringe put human back vial, run risk introducing germs human vaccinated back vial. imagine one extra shot billion that's contaminated HIV hit news... call ‘Project Ludicrous Speed’ Someone accuses saying military isn’t necessary. You: “I didn’t say that!” follow-up therefore agree military important. You: “I didn’t say that!”

Because say either. that's talking about. want conversation get derailed people like you. first comment suggested military downsize compensate hiring children.

That part stance. already explained you.

Here's stance: using ads, video games, JROTC convince children sign military unethical. Full stop. That's said. Everything else responses random questions guys try apply simple statement **DON'T RECRUIT CHILDREN**

How still understand mystery. There's also plandemic, can't plan cool post covid things borders open events scheduled.  take covid denyers population, depression rates probably lot higher. Many covid denyers changed life styles social circles reinforce habits. would downvoted oblivion saying couple weeks ago. join JROTC 13/14.

Then JROTC legally military. [Per US 17 minimum age limit (with parental consent). Nope, go ahead keep making stance feel better.

Your problem children joining military. People cannot join military age 17. 18, people longer children. Therefore, problem 12 also love think something ethical parental consent.

I never said suggested that. making views? mean gf fiancée gay gal great. I'm glad see I'm one!! funny pass lol Israel paid 3-4 times EU, paid time EU.

Europe paid billions vaccine development Pfizer Biontech.

Pfizer acted within contract EU. incompetent EU leaders cheaper investments production manufacturing aquisition punished, incompetence affect Europe entire world.

Israel buy US EU, buys Pfizer. Ever heard free market. Israel also get Moderna vaccine plants within US. facts matter you.

Hello communist, buying stealing. EU leaders blame inept procurement.  Merkel shitting bed hardcore long still vaccinate number people, cares? way better extra doses thrown away. still y’all shut completely? Hey man, wanted say relate lot things said. know it'll help you, reading way put made feel slightly better, least evening. Kind feels good know there's somebody else existentialist, nihilistic headspace, ya know? classes always enough desks. There's zero chance safely distancing classroom let alone lunch room bus. even separate desks enough safe practices.

It's great suburban districts plenty money space smaller overall numbers, idea schools need go back safe* ludicrous many places.

*Insert qualifying safety measures attainable. Good. "" say military necessary."" ≠ ""The military correct shit, empirically wrong.

Serious question: understand context is?

Someone accuses saying military isn’t necessary. You: “I didn’t say that!” follow-up therefore agree military important. You: “I didn’t say first comment entire stance it. Everything else guy made try argue me, instead actually reading wrote.

False. Show first comment suggested military downsize compensate hiring children. No, aseptic technique. contaminated needle ever comes near vial. Sterile needle enters sterile vial, extract dose, remove needle. Use alcohol based swab clean top vial, new sterile needle enters. Repeat etc... least US numbers, figure 33-40% denyers. leaves 50/50 split actual understand situation. Covid vaccination go To. The. Moon. There's guarantee even exposed begin with, anything exposure would boost immune response addition vaccine doses. second dose still job. except got orders EU go like ""send us got available half price put us bitching supplying us"" ;) Don't. permanent solution temporary problem, *never* right answer.

Things *will* get better everywhere. Maybe fast would like, trust me, it'll worth end.  Me. kinda describes home last 11 months... I'm looking forward living life again. boredom isolation really taking toll me. expert avid reader vaccine info. Shouldn’t affect efficacy vaccine. probably decent amount protection first dose already, decent chance won’t end caught do, probably mild. whatever isolate roommates take least week two weeks second dose give max protection, though. Heart attacks often precipitated event. Respiratory distress hypercoagulable state (which appears directly induced covid; patients come ED lab values suggesting thrombotic burden prior factors immobility) secondary covid infection particularly strong triggers. 

Also peak pandemic physicians often skimped details death certificates focus patients still fighting (i.e. deaths simply labeled cardiopulmonary arrest moved on) count fluctuates ways.

Looking additional deaths year perfect gives us best estimate real number. crucial points NZ Australia able get near-zero cases islands (so easily prevent anyone entering) starting virus widespread, hundred cases. 

Most countries would chance able NZ Australia did, matter long strict lockdown had. Riverside county’s website lists teachers 1b category that’s vaccinating. It’s county’s move tier system. Use county’s website register get vaccine. California isn’t using age group aside elderly yet. It’s selfish gross there. think would hard watch behavior week.  Freedom conditional Today's report shows 275k doses Tuesday, seems safe assume 300k close 75% population.  Hot take already got away first time... give second shot. mean, least want get vaccinated... according , US, one enlist military age 17 - that’s parental consent.

You join JROTC entire crusade argument people enlist age 17

Nope, go ahead keep making stance feel better.

I also love think something ethical parental consent. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

It’s really discovery. there. I’m uncommon situation.
I got first dose Pfizer vaccine late January received second dose today. However, right received dose today, got call roommates saying they’ve tested positive covid. got tested right won’t get results days. 
Will vaccine immunity impacted already covid getting second dose? second dose even help me?
Any help would appreciated! absolutely reason let people relax book domestic Easter holidays.

Europe concerned variant beating vaccines.

Remember: mutation hinders transmissibility even slightest (eg spike mutation) confers vaccine resistance (eg spike mutation) appear noise data *until* vaccines widespread.

It's they're much genomic surveillance point trying minimise size vaccinated vs infected front - ""open up"" maximise hospital usage time roll vaccines, chances giving vaccine escape.

It likely shown unnecessary. likely overly precautious. still *fair reason*, depending ones risk profile pandemic 2.0. link Bruh answers shows ignorant respondents were. Think it, granted every teacher administrator immunity magic wand really made safe kids go back? Sure kids low risk death, kids go home school homes parents live. home kids spreading virus going spread parents often old old teachers probably vaccinated.

Sorry came aggressive, lot people share sentiment “it’s head lol relax meditation.” true, head... it’s called mental illness I've heard one before. articles December claiming would 100 million people fully vaccinated yet still probably 5 million people who've received doses.

I said average age 21 **to show mostly adults signing need recruit children.** say recruit anyone 21. buying book! Thank you! deniers

I seen anyone denies existence covid-19 forever thread. found Pink Kush farmer looks like winter surge behind us... What's US going 300 million AZ shots nobody wants? Also Charleston. happy still employed. Hoping mask mandate lifted air turns hot soup again. Discussing military recruting demographics isn’t related proposal military recruiting children?

Didn't say demographics. Said ""strategy"". never said anything strategy attempt derail strawman argument I'm saying recruit anyone. didn’t say did. said SUGGESTED never saying replace (ie, “instead downsize”) asked hire instead. 

Yeah, asked loaded question saying need hire didn’t actually articulate position. That’s fault, anyone reading comment.

Weird two everyone upvoted original comment downvoted strawman comments.

Seems like fault. Well don’t know else you’d explain 500k additional deaths. average increase deaths year year like 30k. mock it, reading different headline ""1 3 Americans Covid-19"" somewhat lockdowns.

I know intelligent that. Yet vaccines still prevent fucking dying...

It’s like media wants stoke anxiety. Can’t $eem pinpoint rea$on$ though. Even pandemic actually over, people need therapy crisis. P PTSD. Jokes COVID, already anxious depressed they’re isolated - staff cares brings facility unknowingly.

Family Well, say shown symptoms. already things COVID issue. managed. past year one difficult me, one point think going see 2021. thanks great friends, powered low point am. Exactly. I'm assuming lot recent dives Covid cases may due extreme weather, although seems like bad thing might rise right back up, decrease might go fast, addition less vaccinations, think overall good thing.

The sharp drop new cases means everyday less less people active cases able transmit disease. addition fact vaccination manufacturers slowed production due weather fact administer faster supplied, leave cold weather period many less active infections lot vaccine supply administer fast. Overall, except places weather detrimental effects (Texas example), seems like good place regards Covid vaccination sites around country able re-open. Lower socioeconomic status + need adaptable = Stress. Shocked Far kind. Far. options come animals cages human use. Seems common denominator pandemics.

Unfortunately, can't anything vote brigading, anytime see comments mocking others, please report we'll remove asap. data watch: varies state state Florida clear lead 400+ cases. That's drop bucket compared total cases state country (not even 1%). However go back couple weeks ago knew handful B117 cases couple states--do let overall falling case counts fool you, B117 growing declining. CDC estimates mid March B117 predominant strain new cases Florida, weeks later rest country. Everything need know here: absolutely not.

AZN vaccine offers ""minimal protection"" mild moderate cases COVID SA variant. also reports several German hospitals severe side effects amongst staff vaccinated AZN product. led stopping vaccinations fear many staff sick leave would shut down.

Overall, AZN vaccine seems dubious, getting would mean continue full lockdown protocol anyway. What's more, may able (or allowed) get different vaccine afterwards. might well wait months longer mRNA vaccines available and/or clinical data for, maybe updated version of, AZN vaccine.  far got worst performance candidate brought market. earlier high dose banging territory user starts become immune viral vector used, really remains seen third booster work well.

Besides that, bring summertime baby creates logistical challenge end needing track vaccine people got first dose make sure right one available come second dose make sure get right one. volunteer vaccine distribution site ton complexity created started jabbing Moderna Pfizer. Eventually got easier simply Pfizer separate center Moderna. Israel many Moderna doses might make sense distribute internally.

Of course make available countries instead sitting them. It’s Israel. used killing people violating human rights. think plenty states already exactly almost like lockdowns damage letting virus live us... work worked person bulk this.

Lol that's president! Ah yes! Inciting violence bad. Committing genocide Xinjiang though, that’s fine long big economy. But...but imported frozen food! think huge part whole overreaction people know actual statistics.

A huge number people think COVID death rate like 15% healthy 40 year old. I've told people circle according CDC &amp; John Hopkins University actually around 0.5% demographic people always shocked. 


Another thing shocks people average age COVID death literally higher average life expectancy. much longer ruin decades peoples lives order give 80 year old another 4 months life? Again, cannot provide regime/country purely intellectual. waste time. I've shown time time wrong. choose wallow ignorance. fun. refused shot ICU.

It's like.. think they'd know risks are. yet is. see anyone could taking vaccine medical field. There's extensive research studies proving good objectively protects you. it’s bad I’m feeling anything it? Covid November, maybe that’s I’m reacting much vaccine Good work Rockstar! No, know that. make assumptions wrong. Economics exact science ideologically weighted. Much negative aspects globalisation becoming visible voiced such. paradigm shift happing right actually benefits globalisation. developed world working classes clear losers, Gini-coefficient keeps growing, income inequalities putting massive strain society's cohesion. US/France 2020 riots beginning. governments figure protects weakest. far we're seeing little regard. In... open air? Nah, look silly. virus work way. flu symptoms good thing, means body should. get 2nd shot till March 15th happy run low grade fever feel shitty day two. good news [things trending downward Here's hoping ramp up. sounds like probably still protects pretty good severe cases/ deaths.

One question know things. article states vaccine still able neutralize virus lab tests. current dosage isn’t enough protect variant, would maybe third shot good enough instead creating new modified vaccine? thanks Part may well expectations people have. huge uptake annual flu vaccinations UK, well amount EU countries far I'm aware, people frame reference expect. I'm sure fair number side effects people call sever debilitating would written ""nothing worse flu jab"" people regularly getting Yes really think that's alarming saying general wear one. Source fewer side effects Pfizer? it’s okay man, sorry defensive. 

married not, still enjoy cumming lol. even fail ever convince another person join me, like knowing toys toy box ready playtime fancy strikes lol. [It severe disease deeply afraid setback terms vaccines us.

It's going keep things way they've longer. sucks, ultimately it'll overcome we'll get back track vaccinations. sucks close world interfere one situations look things like figures like new cases dropping.

Also NYT journalism crap wouldn’t waste time one Israel paid 40% more, EU. Check newspaper.

Israel paid late, much later EU. ordered 20 times less EU.

And Israel invest cent BioNTech development.

Yes, EU guilty. 600'000+ deaths, every day averaging 2000+, EU continues send vaccines World. EU full right obligation implement export ban. Want Pfizer? Build factory, Israel. Ha. Ha. Ha.

Expecting perfection guidelines never shift unreasonable. tests false positive cross positive. Italy we’re 5% blood samples dating back summer 2019 testing positive, wouldn’t make sense: first wave (spring 2020) hit 4% population hospital system completely collapsed. airborne bit. takes one person infected eventually spread whole world Lots limitations. work tried get there's many stipulations guidelines. can't commit giving 100% doses they'll cut supply. trying aim 20 per day health dept keen it. doctors asymptomatic. discovered routine checks, linked clusters wards. would demonstrate fact vaccinated people could also carriers virus, beware alarmism: vaccine certainly protects disease necessarily infection. Furthermore, moment yet possible establish whether infected vaccinated transmit virus turn. 15 28 days given vaccine. might “conspiracy” theory want people investigate pro-life anti-pedophilia facade that. Projection powerful tool. 

The United States supported SARS research Wuhan dangerous domestically. need review virus research centers globally. Also need tackle low hanging fruit could reduce future pandemics, mink farms. Wtf still allow mink farms? 1% difference, well within margin error variablility.

China infrastructure place Africa get people vaccinated. China provide vaccine Africa. repaid access resources. 

America focus sphere influence get Americas vaccinated. 

Europe needs focus poorer countries. overall main purpose lockdowns flatten curve overwhelm hospitals patients contain adequate care needed. known counter-measure epidemics years vaccine available. Secondary, could limit overall positive cases. ultimately reduce number shared one scientifically published article literally find thousands matter.

My point being, lockdowns actually reduce overall death count. Granted could've done achieve further. 

These certainly tough times, saying ""destroyed society"" little dramatic. stop pretending know talking leave experts. Yeah UN right this. India, take vaccine want countries even received first batch. unfair. Need fair distribution plan. No- according PHE virus exactly virus risk anyone Ok, following logic: hospitals Wuhan started pressure beginnig January (3 months US), still suggests outbreak started China before. BS created media coverage. First reports botched studies AZ. 
Then focussing ""only"" 70% reported efficiancy without talking good prevention severe cases.
After Handelsblatt bs goverment source claiming 8% efficiancy 65 older. Still retracted btw.
Then reports low efficiancy vs SA variant. Concerning irrelevant point UK variant becoming problem. 
Now reports whole Fire Departments Ambulance Services reduce capacity severe reactions like higher fevers AZ shots.

Welcome Germany. 

PS: want laugh facepalm day, look newest study University Hamburg origin coronavirus claiming came lab using twitter posts, epoch times others sources make claim. we've hearing long COVID awhile, along warnings young people need fear disease get long covid, permanent lung damage, brain fog, develop psychiatric symptoms, fatigue, etc. feels like awhile back kept hearing stories along lines ""I young healthy ran marathons, COVID get exhausted walking feet!""

It's tragic 80 year old dies course, also tragedy fit healthy 25 year old becomes disabled life? make sense prioritize vaccinating risk catching virus? 

It inspire confidence public health messaging messaging young people scared virus, vaccinate 55 year old work home order instacart ahead 25 year old work grocery store exposed virus every day. sorry loss zero COVID lunatics appear taken Ireland others parts Europe. massive public uproar stop them. 7-day average new cases US dropped 11% last two days

seeing curve plummet like *more* things open month ago really makes think we're seeing combination seasonality partial herd immunity. virus running super-spreaders infect Literally can't tell sarcastic Oof Florida man’s offspring anti-vaxxers! PCP awhile. sucked every year went see him, thought, ""this guy sucks, keep going him"", stopped.

There's pretty big gap ""friendly neighborhood doctor private practice actually gets know you"" ""employee corporate health care conglomerate sees 15 minutes every year probably barely remembers exist"". weird I've pretty good relationships specialists veterinarians, really like dentist, primary care quick easy thing go corporate walk-in/urgent-care clinic. since use chain, records. Infection fatality ratio higher 0.23%. believe 0.5% number winter closer 1% beginning pandemic ( March/April 2020) patients put ventilator quickly wasn’t established protocol care. best estimate percentage population infection 30%.

Assuming lasting immunity reach herd immunity around 30-40% vaccinated population, probably May. Assuming 8 hour work day, 3 shots per minute.

Oh wait don’t utilize common sense either Thanks u/milfpounder420 wealthy countries hold everyone vaccinated country give others. instance US 100 million doses J&amp;J 100 million doses Novavax. doubt injected arms United States despite early hoopla J&amp;J. US able finish vaccination July even zero J&amp;J shots. J&amp;J able fulfill obligations June therefore J&amp;J .is needed wanted US. likely US gets J&amp;J doses June sent countries Especially given people putting needles arms arms seem short supply, rather doses themselves. week pent supply, hands deck stab people.  elementary school. even remember principal praising students ""still showing even though really sick"". Sure could. issue right think getting orders. seem falling significantly behind also significant production issues one dose let alone two. Could affect absorption maybe, also Pfizer vials absolutely tiny. know live?  Well wonder hell they're live one countries still can't get one Maybe US needs help countries. Cricket lol. Classy snowstorm North East bad. Got fair amount, predicted Persons severe disabilities can’t even get vaccine mid March (March 15) California, people already complaining that’s “too early.” wouldn’t expect young, healthy people getting vaccine late May June earliest. Wish did. sorry loss Hey I'm fine us giving money. vaccines. get homie, like staying inside want get trashed favorite bars cost people's lives. That's nice little late them. Sorry Mesa? lol they're still better us Original variant oxymoron May/June  J&amp;J already followup two dose trial. think enough cases happening US complete it. I’m RN manage clinic. I’ve given go ahead order administer much vaccine possible adhering phase standards, administration directed prioritize this. order much vaccine give. 

I’ve taken opportunity finally help colleagues hospital slowing flow beds. I’m spreading clinic’s resources thin possible make happen. Sounds like something new jackass movie Ireland’s lockdown 7 weeks still getting 900ish cases day. lockdown apparently going extended 2 months people aren’t happy this. think existing jab combat SA variant moment test run confirm create booster. go approval production still need. 

The advantage may help counter next variant develops we'll stock. 85 year old grandmother appointment saw hours line long couldn’t stand in, left. frustrating close science doesn’t lie sure, keep rebelling something makes look incredibly stupid directly contributes still situation. You’re sure showing us. do. Thanks advice. think US take single dose. store ship elsewhere guess. MRNA vaccines significantly better too. really longer need J&amp;J. Moderna survive long enough general fit needs refrigerator. possibly keep small doses Novavax sit six months otherwise see happening lot. surprise me. expect time ramp sent countries. Probably first month two approval gets distributed US. probably enough stuff. Relevant think much shitshow. Bloomberg tracker shows US used 80% supply. Neither countries nationwide lockdown months, local lockdowns last days. find hilarious you’re trying make success bad thing though. plus side, vaccine won’t sting get eyes! thing right would huge human rights issue. one. 

If say care want us home: personally done help get us home safe way? Given ignorance situation, sincere guess absolutely nothing. I'm trying mean say this, think would right assume spent time telling stranded Aussies roll take one team.

You care us. pretend do. point message long many people grasp experience, people like Fauci aren’t sharing it. 

You might right though different masks actually experts directly saying don’t work. True, possible, data published far.
From know far, Novavax much effective single dose J&amp;J waiting EUA (see numbers above). Ask pharmacists like giving vaccines, bane existence, they're expected along numerous prescriptions fill day. pharmacies realized could make money making overworking staff, even realize can't handle anywhere near level vaccinations.

Signed,
Someone lives border Vancouver actual metro area Seattle. miss Coffee Crisp friends there. I've heard quite personal anecdotes people covid previously getting hit kinda hard first dose, less reaction first dose. infected getting hit harder 2nd dose. social group mostly doctors quite caught covid think they've 2nd dose vaccine now. purely guessing bet would 2nd shot would less side effects 1st.


[How effective single Good article plenty discussion stats various vaccines. main thing data long immunity lasts 1 shot studies. MMR vaccine shot pretty similar terms effectiveness doses, 1 giving like 80% 2 95% (Edit post, 80% one 3 article even mentions MMR gives stats lol). 


My wife MD mostly guessing along it'll probably become like yearly flu shot. Get yearly booster common strains since it'll likely never go away. ALSO, studies ""effectiveness"" different... *For one, Israeli study found single dose vaccine reduced number people testing positive virus, i.e. infected, 33%, Pfizer paper suggested would prevent 52% developing symptoms – looked two different things.* IIRC Johnson Johnson vaccine looks ""symptoms"". vax single dose getting 66% whatever really different single dose vaccines, know long immunity lasts compares 2 doses. Neither idiots refusing vaccine. worry anybody else easily virus spreads species, could start wiping keystone species? Well mean we're going personal anecdotes wrong, I've several friends long haulers suffering serious effects virus, one friend suffering heart issues now, another kidney, another developed type 1 diabetes 36 years old. even use personal anecdotes go actual data, still wrong, maybe instead getting mad learn cope things make afraid healthier way, yeah? get tetanus MMR boosters CVS, infrastructure definitely ways easier. New York :( cops bad. yeah, lot assholes. still think high risk politicians shouldn’t making public health decisions. I’d argue study uses poor methodology. basically looked ages people died Covid, looked life expectancy typical person age, subtracted age life expectancy. issue people died covid pre-existing conditions, would reduced life expectancy. Oh yeah, I’m currently mid-30s wish happened mid-20s lol. FINALLY money travel places... nope! use Moderna like US use J&amp;J one shot thing needs happen ASAP. That's it?

I'd prefer I'm reminded mass death disease given option.  Merkel Macron Well 90% people without vaccine get severe covid anyways Same. It’s still hard understand people them! like theyre produced rapidly? Im sure countries making provide others point they're infinite.  Maybe countries stopped relying hand downs?

Them messing many things dosage trials, age participants etc ..that's many strikes there's better alternatives Why? question still stands: edit comment talk Trump? far know, exactly brought conversation 250M eligible, best case 200M group get it. 1 every 5 adults going get vaccine already gotten it.

Also cases started quarantined virus became dangerous following logic; would possible “more dangerous”variation became dominant?! doesnt make sense, it. hate NNN pro-Trump discussion forums try promote anti-vaccine propaganda trying document every person gets infected getting fully partially vaccinated.

Educating people COVID-19 telling kills people. also means things explaining respiratory virus wearing mask reduces risk transmission. Another key point fact deaths happen elderly people, precautions focused preventing getting sick. 


Also, news outlets often give misleading information downplays exaggerates danger COVID-19. causes lot confusion, makes people lose trust media, even showing accurate information death counts. Can’t come island quarantine...? ever happened Christmas Island situation? Hi,  


I bought N95 masks look like holes mask. 

Request: anyone know masks safe?

[Images mask think way optimistic That's really good way run business.

Pharmaceutical companies care profits first, killing maiming patients good way run business. even make much profit vaccines ongoing treatments. 2 3 depressed anxious anyway So, reading correctly wearing mask indoor common areas people may walk into?

Further, wearing mask sounds like? Thank You. guy thumbnail look much like Julius Caesar?  Didn’t even read article. Read title already agreed. Millions doses great much good people want allowed get them. claim US capable that? probably right, many people take lockdowns seriously I'm sure could convince everyone so. that's point. fact people take seriously period, pandemic lasted longer needed therefore causing prolong sense social isolation consequently depression.

Sometimes you’re going doesn’t make sense now, promise later. way doesn’t get better quit. get better.

Hang there! Hospitals pressure March places. takes certain population density spread virus quickly, small percent sick people need hospital care, need large amount sick people overwhelm hospitals. cases needed high, takes time. Given long incubation period two weeks, people exposed, developed symptoms later, ended hospital much later. Oh, wow, surprising. It’s vaccine doesn’t confer immunity. Period. Nah, fuck C levels. 

Call payback hoarding profits paying workers fairly.

Well, we're still trying friends, seen year knows can. Kinda tough know going dates people such...  think you’re misunderstanding method used extract extra doses. involve reinserting used syringe vial. would never fly.

The idea pull dose vial new syringe, also pull air inside via along it. first pulling (aspirating) liquid vaccine vial. correct volume vaccine in, move end needle sterile air inside vial aspirate little bit that.

You keep track volumes position plunger scale side syringe.

When inject vaccine, position syringe vertical (eg position arm) air bubble top last thing gets pushed out. 

Thus plunger fully dispensed position, air needle instead wasted vaccine.

It’s difference drawing 1.1 mL vaccine able dispense 1.0 mL 0.1 mL vaccine stuck syringe, drawing 1.0 mL vaccine plus 0.1 mL air leaving sterile air syringe instead.

(Numbers made simplicity).

The process takes little longer prepare syringe, increases doses available reducing wastage.

China resolved cases putting anyone contact Covid patient isolation 2 weeks wouldn’t spread disease others. strategy countries like South Korea Vietnam used successfully (so reason believe China specifically lying working - countries open strategy since February ESPECIALLY know plethora standard medical procedures existing medicines stop, prevent virus together?

In USA care much “freedom” instead we’ve deal year loose, still frustrating lockdowns. “medicines” stop virus spreading herd immunity vaccine. Non-pharmaceutical interventions border closures, quarantines travelers, temporary quarantines anyone came contact covid case effective haven’t dared effectively USA (and allowed virus spread everywhere February April, probably strategy wouldn’t effective anyway - countries successfully managed right beginning).

Well hold now, depressed loooong before, better lumping [Here go. can't fucking wait get mine man. hug homies tuck bed night finally think it’ll really hard get people stay home at-risk people vaccinated hospital numbers look good (me included tbh) assume people tired overly anxious people. guess perspective ""we're year acting like March 2020"". Wow, shocker. I’m impatient anyone effort actually moving absolutely staggering rate think it. Pfizer Moderna hadn’t come we’d hailing J&amp;J miracle workers getting effective vaccine arms year’s time. typical entitled millennial attitude. US doesn’t owe anyone shit.

It stopped quality life became contrarianism. Umm, exactly study discussed article look life lost difference individual’s age death life expectancy. adult teachers become infected children teens - children infect one another take home households, especially multi-generational households. folks specifically track community transmission school transmission separately numbers look good schools, whole story. kid might never tested asymptomatic grandma gets Covid.  


It's matter masking either. social distancing, enough sanitization, enough ventilation.  depends school school school. kids approved vaccines, care must taken even teacher vaccinations.  Yes, one mask. Two security theater Hahahahahaha you’re something special Exactly, thoughts lockdowns make question usefulness contexts (especially include decisions appear arbitrary based science), end subs immediately turn around people find want make giant conspiracy theory type thing I'm like... I'm out. Never apologize getting vaccine. First second dose. arms get jabbed, better. 2 3 adults already depressed anxious COVID-19.... shitty headlines like anti vaxxers. mrna vaccines tho America, probably. Europe, no. course edit reply, keep living authoritarian lifestyle yours, we'll see people real world listen lol  agree going back teachers fully vaccinated (and mean fully, day first shot), still think distancing high schoolers good idea don’t infect others’ families. Backing safety efforts think we’ve “too long” exactly surge month ago. think they're talking Europe. Situation *insane*, I've heard (think Spring 2020 again). UK even stated social distancing *next* Christmas table.

I mean, *want* that. truth, *law*. Make will. Yes, fear mongering control.

But flip side, nobody show anxiety thread without ridiculed shamed downvoted invisibility. subreddit becoming extreme opposite fear mongering. starting sound lot like ""there sharks water"" style propaganda. body meant spend much time red alert. think anxiety? supposed help us Stay safe back sleep also hide animals trying eat us. worry food coming certainly Walmarts back then.... love ding I've seen dick people way credibility - think deserves twitter ban, idk parts TOS he's broken point, I've given trying change anti-AZ vaccine mindset around here.

Nothing change mind, what's point? Let time thing; countries accept AZ vaccines either become normal place plagueland.

Maybe supply Pfizer/Moderna enough keep EU countries rejecting AZ going vaccination programme, hope write leaders donate vaccines countries want it.

I hope preventable deaths happen consequence mindset spilled real world. clear deaths preventable AZ vaccine clearly important anti-AZ vaccine crowd here. wanted train, 2nd dose still important long term immunity, messaging ""Waiting next vaccine"" terrible challenging get people back 2nd one. like get shot, get 2nd appointment, we're urged get next one asap. measles vaccine around decades. proven safe. good reason vaccine trials needing take time real world, usually 10+ years. 

That case treatment. experimental drug studied 1 year. experimental treatment, experimental category treatment. 

The typical vaccine uses weakened destroyed virus combined something like aluminum salt provoke n immune reaction. treatment different. mRNA injected body, causes body create virus spike protein cells. body attacks cells get immunity. 

I hope it’s safe. technology could prove hugely beneficial sorts ways, it’s still unproven mid-long term period. Pregnant women, example, extensively tested all. 2-3 years could find auto-immune issues cancer consequence injections. don’t know. 

Yet people cheering people literally forced receive injections. It’s disturbing. think many words replace politician sentence. Getting vaccine seriously decreases transmissions helps keep others safe. right thing morally. areas vaccinating teachers, say even vaccinating reopen schools

This worst option. commonly happening? Honestly, think Biden going polar opposite direction Trump, utilizing Rodrick principle. Set bar real low, improvement seem like miracle. Overpromise underdeliver.  That's...not science works. Except Biden made executive order mandating federal property. fucking purse? moderating. shutting ideas opinions. Many children cannot learn remotely. Taking classes zoom isn’t like classroom all. difference know long covid, long term consequences vaccines really rare. 
At end decide risk take. always good global leaders set good example people look They're federal property. Biden mandated mask wearing federal property.

Unless wants break executive order, to. appreciate feedback. One reason I’m passionate frustrations school closures connection special needs kids. “little brother” big brother big sister program. He’s special ed, fairly high functioning, foster care associated trauma ended there. Covid, school closed, social workers try zoom can’t engage with. sat home months mental health deteriorated. ended suicidal held children’s hospital. kicked several foster homes, definitely came close hurting others. 

To see teachers Oregon continue claim keeping schools closed stay safe infuriating. Schools purpose, save lives, teachers vital health needy poor special ed. safety at-risk kids stuck home. see continue refuse provide vital services even vaccinated (or before, cost/benefit analysis never fell side long term school closures) infuriating.

About [180,000 people join military means 13.89% 17.36% people recruited children JROTC, well 50%. military survive 150,000 recruits year without trying get children join.

Of course, entirely possible lockdowns cause declines, people wearing masks properly cause increases, but... let's real. obviously way complicated that. even worse theres CHANCE even able something.

Glad see a) talked possible side effect b) serious health concern. except social anxiety fucked covid. I'm ready kill pretty much. still 95%? Cause seem recall Pfizer came figure *before* variants emerged. ""Sacrificial worker"" term I've using.  I'm sure know talking about. use word ""freedom"" context ""small businesses"" ""shut downs"" shut downs necessary. necessary short amount time people put ""countrymen first"".

Is freedom hospitals overwhelmed people suffering COVID can't even get check delay necessary surgeries? seem care businesses good businesses infrastructure apparently buckle pandemic addressed properly?

We live society put ""countrymen first"" like claim do, would federal lockdown, like sensible countries, year long half-ass lockdown. lockdown start problems healthcare infrastructure guess long boutique run stays open that's freedom? vein, I'm glad ""dicknosing"" stopped used much.

or see threads used. sure even reading point. never mentioned freedom speech, did. never spoke purist regards that, wasting time going that. I'm commenting intellectualism. Period

Give example pro science regime. not, pointless continue. One spicy thing: One major advantage approval EMA Pfizer/Biontech pay damages. got almost normal approval. also heavily advertised politicians. “We take longer review pay something goes wrong. trust vaccine”

But amount damages Pfizer pay capped 120mio €. per person. whole Germany. capped according law.

So end waiting saved us 120 million max... I'm depressed government policy turning country police state people accepting without question.

Sure, could carry teachers, grandparents, etc, makes sense distance lessen risk. see someone said interpret wrong freak out. UK varients still small percentage US? side coin complaining about. doom porn direction.

Normalcy return enough people get vaccinated. That's gonna be. social end pandemic coming within next months. accounting people want vaccine? high rejection rate could move timetable right? 33% skepticism rate means 50% vaccine rest us. ""Only""

Let's real, scope deaths insanely large people saying ""only"" regards 21k deaths age group deaths entirely premature. age group associated frail health.

I’m saying don’t deserve vaccines come on, way way people front line professions vaccines go around. It’s simple math. everyone get right away, almost front line workers struggling get it. It’s tiring see headlines front line jobs somehow deserving vaccine front line jobs. Like are, don’t enough vaccines, groups gonna get later others. Life’s fair. Immune reaction virus, obvious second third dose vector work good first one. works already contact wild form vector. 

That sputnik V uses two different viruses. 

We really study scheme vector virus first shot, mRNA second shot. somewhat agree since younger people likely spread cases death elderly. Shit rapid fire nursing homes such. makes numbers look super bad. Ike seeing decreasing cases cause vaccinated now.

I cover hospitals state (pharmacist). people old got admitted saw. parents kids require ""baby sitting"" age 50, suck incredibly low risk send kid school get semblance education. meant: reduces likelihood symptomatic disease factor x, severe disease likelihood factor x, better preventing severe disease preventing symptomatic disease, additional protection.

Most people thought would better protection severe disease, meaning deep tissue infection, superficial infection upper mucosal layers. vaccines really change mucosal immunity, administered muscle tissue, sprayed nose mouth.

But looks like this: Either vaccinated immune response fast enough stop infection early, breakthrough mass replication, much use anymore.

Reasons breakthrough could think of: Vaccine applied fat tissue, genetic factors, illness, even lifestyle whatever else contributes lower titers, high viral dose. It’s truly blessing watch cuomo go flames.  mean, 74% American adults 20 overweight per CDC. Can’t win elections potentially pissing 74% electorate. think suspected while. wife got 1st jab back December something, one doctors said 85% protection without 2nd jab. got 2nd jab time still Jesus Christ dude, science blows mind. well billion people infected COVID-19. already rising mutation pressure outwit natural immunity. already know we're probably going need annual boosters. 

Even 8-9-week time lag (rather 3-4 week) US gets 100M people vaccinated month sooner. notion 3 vs. 8 weeks opening pandora's box sensationalist. Ok buddy, best luck you. Seems like nice thing do, suppose USA made pledge? 80 year old grandparents spent dozens hours telephone line luck. hope means finally get vaccinated! janitors, bus drivers (often older semi-retirees), lunch workers, counselors, coaches, teaching interns? ignored given vaccine, education seen ""lower"" others? 

&amp;#x200B;

Selfish parents want babysitters back. Students learn fine remotely parents willing take part education. disguise thing effectively monty python sketch ; remember fake beards  Nah, I'm mess too. Difference accept problems problems, I'm enthusiastically supporting social engineering bullshit make society accommodating issues. Masks security theater, vast majority people realize comply avoid confrontation. People like drag bullshit coping mechanism neurosis selfish ones. ignoring facts TON evidence safe kids school?

Please please please listen NPR interview Harvard doc. aired friend pissed people using tik-tok connection China, yet buys hundreds dollars worth useless shit every year dollar store pranks gags. understood point, hypocritical pissed others using tik-tok spends money useless shit ultimately comes China second dose probably necessary protect south African variant, unfortunately. one shot vaccines accelerate vaccine escape, won’t able keep boosters. Also, people end hospital medium term vaccinated longer protection mutated variant overcome vaccine-induced immune response. happen allowed to. coming someone received second dose Pfizer vaccine early January. [China provides less funding Norway, Sweden funding assessed voluntary funding (aka Bill Melinda Gate Foundation) offer pittance. guys squabbling whether Canada deserve happening gloating whining think come back issue hand. People still dying thousands everyday everywhere world, still elder people first care workers. think would make sense vaccinate those, worldwide, going risk 30yo. minimise worldwide number deaths.

And yes Canada bad job want tell that. like participation vaccine either. like always we're small country (population wise) companies would rather produce closer big marker instead investing factories here.

But know situation opposite would've supplied us well many countries doses wanted, long enough carry vaccination side risk people. finished country first think rest world. 

We good pandemic. took care people, trying make sure die covid hunger. watch neigbours terror anxiety seeing previous gouvernement give damn help. know much could've done. we'll wait turn, still cautious variant cases till get vaccine, neigbours real great that's cool them. 

But yeah... yesterday 95yo grand mother got letter telling vaccine delayed again. 74yo father near getting vaccine either. make jelly thinking still die covid cause vaccine went dude wants BBQ July 4th. I'm human. get almost certain, actual science data best thing combat fear-mongering.

Not messaging vaccinated individuals still need isolate, still need stay home categorically told meet vaccinated individuals.

That sends message vaccine pointless hurts uptake.

As stories saying still need masks social distancing even majority vaccinated. maybe technically true according current data, terrible messaging public Im doctor would think antibodies tcells get work detect virus first means chance test + it, right?

Plus didnt pfizer moderna test symptomatic? True. people overreact  Well, teachers then. state, teachers getting vaccinated first, despite fact schools still closed Teachers' Union agreeing go back, even teachers vaccinated. Thank explanation! doubt there's data previous ""coronavirus seasons"" peaked

Did look? Right like imagine two women sitting police station next two guys dresses like marshals avoid wearing masks. That’s sitcom shit right there. latter still decreases spread almost always, doesn’t completely prevent it.

Actually don’t know cases vaccine 0 effect contagiousness, I’m always open learning Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine globally approved end March widely distributed May onward, vaccinations accelerate rapidly second quarter year Arizona?? likely simply want free government sponsored baby sitting public schools become. every parent trailer house resident Arkansa started squirting rugrats high school prom. find majority parents older teachers teach kids, would mean parents mor likely die virus teachers... vaccinate parents skip teachers? would make much sense. remote learning, college students remote learning time. Hell remote learning college education fine. Yeah catch fine, suicides across board indicative mental health issue across nation, interesting Republicans keep fighting universal health care increased mental health priorities versus Democrats. oh least Democrats support insurrections. don’t know whole sub thinks science incapable looking forward making predictions, able look backward past data.

Plenty scientists expected vaccine would decrease infectivity. increases immune system ffs. stronger immune system clears virus faster. means less days spent infected. means less chance spread virus. Yes, news seems huge, question short term countries adjust accordingly. What's current measures adherence? Total lockdown 24/7 group spitting? news coming efficacy 1 shot, I'm seriously considering getting second one.

It's 48 hours since first dose anxiety developing blood platelet disorder made 48 hours little, no, sleep. can't 4 weeks. Promised. Let’s hope actually deliver. Good point, mistake AZ. I'll return edit original case somebody get comment. mean, there’s pretty much zero data says long one dose effective vs two doses. 
I’d much rather listen science two doses proper trial comparing efficacy one dose vs two dose.

Everyone’s “listen science data” becomes inconvenient so. initially lost 15 pounds, gained back bit since. thing remotely resembling 'getting house' getting takeout, starts add up. summer made bit going local parks, winter especially tough.

Granted could using exercise equipment every day this, didn't. Every day keep trying get started (was thinking needed morning, better get work starts). Don’t get wrong, I’ll get J&amp;J that’s one get. really want Moderna Pfizer though. could've possibly foreseen German health department leaking false ""8% efficacy"" misinformation press would effect? Oh right, absolutely everyone. Congrats, played yourself. Baka gaijin! take long? understanding vaccines going everywhere last December. acknowledge pay attention news regarding vaccines anywhere state U.S. I'm angry people gotten know people work home offered it. I'm hoping guys get plenty vaccines quickly. hell get Hawaii? thought quarantine enter. manufacturing plant? noticeable uptick people claiming masks social distancing worse virus itself. Claiming literally ""How much longer ruin decades peoples lives order give 80 year old another 4 months life?""

Those people think 500,000 deaths bad. see value public health efforts pursue 500,000 1,000,000. That’s sad feel family, makes even tragic dying preventable disease. hope coworkers make connection. racking big credit card bills! sub anti-vax lately even know sarcasm not. mods sure hell care. alcoholism new hobby. 😎 elephant room America wants ignore. don’t think heard one politician talk diet. Thank you! second dose Sunday, here’s hoping! mean, Pfizer great vaccine, feel insecure edit headline? praising article. friend broke girlfriend (they engaged married) 2020 probably better pandemic anyone else know since then. Lots positive life changes after. Yeah, you’re totally right. data important vaccinated folks social circle, I’ve avoided gathering get jab.

I get almost certain, actual science data best thing combat fear-mongering. 

I’ll take good news point, even obvious. Florida. basically already fully open  legacy sub coddled extremists accelerated spread disease via platforming misinformation.  

Here's simple reality: highly effective vaccines. We're matter months ending this. Stop inventing crazy shit avatar scream at. Stop pretending authority figures want lock closet. Stop pretending restrictions crowds wearing mask stay home orders. Stop using neonazi tactics try redpill laymen anti mask anti vaxx bullshit. Stop trying get people infect get vaccinated. Mad authority? Great. Go something instead spreading lies trying radicalize people internet. Well played UK scientists. Better 85% coverage twice many people risk groups covered quickly possible. anyone actually booking vaccine appointments “for months”? You’d think people would realize important power is. Aside shitshow everyone seeing Texas, vaccines need kept freezers. outbreak disrupts power system employees, literally EVERYTHING shuts severely limited. Ok. Sorry don’t tin foil hat.  Thanks Joe Believing governments. So, college baseball team moved back there. looking forward going games (it would also totally safe go one goes games packs stands like sardines) 

Anyways, limiting tickets right family friends I’m kinda bummed (while also respecting decision so) would felt totally safe opposed going bar inside. Look obesity rates. 

Look diabetes rates. 

Look heart disease rates. 

These top co-morbidity rates. 

USA diet problem. call generalising condition one city entire country ""backed up""? claiming nationwide massive underreporting without sources ""not conspiracy theories""? worst source gave, one refers Indian tabloid trash also anything substantive written proves massive underreporting. 

You also think little press freedom India despite providing multiple examples viciously anti government media sources. 

 Read understand country media works another bullshit reminder. central government state government same. pro Modi outlet place like Jharkhand Rajasthan absolutely incentive speaking state government state Healthcare managed. last reminder, press index ranking drastically influenced justified security lockdown Kashmir. person knowledge India pretends expert writes. knowledge structure government. knowledge Media. Yet wants keep passing judgements place thousands Kms away. Lol.

You know what's truth you? want accept India done far better think like. deep prejudice India leads read stuff come conspiracy theories. 

Someone deluded :) previous administration done differently? Florida lol 1.365% population receive shot two mRNA vaccines lot readily available Q3 ITT: brave people stating soon get shot done caring. extremely interesting cases underlines expectations:
- vaccines extremely effective preventing serious cases
- they’re 100% effective
- protection transmission line overall efficacy Well, day 13 Pfizer, that's like what? 75-80%? ... /s noted study 0 people fell severely ill. Indeed, that's cool-headed people saying back January. 70% isn’t crappy also lifesaving still. (I know you’re shocked read that) Wait, actually think government lie citizens order give hope?

What fuck ""Johnson &amp; Johnson said Friday submitted emergency use listing COVID-19 vaccine World Health Organization (WHO).
The company said process prerequisite supply vaccines COVAX vaccine program co-led WHO, aims deliver doses poor middle-income countries."" I'm Maine. idea sign one saw article morning Pfizer Moderna 92% effective. Yeah dare teachers school staff want protect families health either death complications. bunch privileged pricks.

/S prime example ignorance allowed shit explode US \^ hope next couple months supply ramps point people longer go absurd lengths get it... mean, obviously messed two tried game system guess say positive side want badly enough go lengths. hope attitude becomes prevalent enough gets us mess. never replace lost time together whatevs, long one dies covid right

I'm sorry. seeing partner LDR first place even seen him/her 3 months even started truly important people dying.

How fucking say straight face lmao. situation sucks plenty people LDR. see gf Russia one year non-pandemic reasons able look mirror thought people dying important waiting 6 months year. Viral vector vaccines old school. first one used outside clinical trials ebola vaccine 2019. pandemic reminder take anything granted. hate people lost lives, final days world pandemic turmoil around them. 

Thankfully one super closed claimed, still hate parents robbed whole year (and counting) senior years. time already limited is. major plans one final big international trip, I'm sure feasible be. long.... actually something like 93% vs. 95% good point. Part nobody knows long protection lasts nobody vaccine couple months. theory 2nd shot prolongs benefit.

But would change giving 2nd shot 3-4 months instead 3-4 weeks would completely change rollout make go much faster. hope it. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* seem want argue someone me. said teachers must vaccinated first. Sounds like sad life. would feel satisfied that. local pharmacies spend aLOT money special deep freezers said reality be. going same. Governors point put start repealing stuff we're already starting see even New York. Asking people wear masks closing peoples businesses year different things.

I highly doubt Benjamin Franklin would take away people's freedom make living like certain states done. Right? But, no, world top fuck every single opportunity get rid nightmare pandemic. know better would think leaders actually want pandemic end 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ reading something Boston apparently drive elderly person vaccine site, get vaccine yourself. younger people basically ""buying"" elderly people bringing get vaccine could get too.

Not sure true is, thought kind funny clever. mean could get taking Mother, would pounce it. think large part heart right place like really put line get health care workers shots first bore brunt crisis initially. ironic cost much political capital many refused take shot.

But can't stop flexing, blaming, bragging, etc. makes want hate him. Lol according what’s said right now. Sounds like it’s masks 2023. disbelief read morning email! weeks sensationalizing headlines actually writing article places blame medical experts?? Sample size issues, I'd guess. enough people 1 dose 2 collect good data. appropriate username find (very) silver lining. takes 5 minutes make one bro hop it. No. fda cdc take months review. Go vacation times. Convene panel... Smoking obscene amounts pot mask mandate, border closings minimum.  Definitely claiming fake news prioritizing ""economy""  UK strategy completely vindicated now. wear thick N99 mask, I'd like start wearing light surgical ones. Well would change policy. would hold giving 2nd dose 3-4 months rather 3-4 weeks would greatly speed rate people first shots would significantly change whole situation. really hope done globally. Felony Canada indictable.  Maybe dressed rich people get access vaccine Florida prioritizing wealthy zip codes, instead. Getting people back second vaccine three months surely different three weeks? got phone call Monday doctor's surgery appointment Wednesday get first Pfizer jab, second appointment 5th May. turned Wednesday, given card date first jab batch details vaccine, told come back three months. Ez. thought horde immunity, Walking Dead style. mean sure, OP specifically asking 4 weeks second dose. Promised operative word. ok asking? Moderna dominant US, much easier store. Miami Heat used screen fans recent game - reports, seems could used - theme parks, concerts, sports games. ""lock downs""  like US lockd 50% bushiness still open?  huge affect even then. actual lock would faded hard. Vietnam island neither korea China. lock downs well. see someone purposefully lnew person covid (and children too) sent school , even intent , person basically endangering hundreds lives, knew it. Well that's mute point. good place ask anywhere: investigators trying find source virus get non-mutated version better vaccines scientific reason looking assign blame? guess could mechanically find origin know going forward mix bat meat hot dogs something saying “Hey it’s fault” seems pretty petty irrelevant point. It’s like there’s going reparations. US also health care system problem, ignorance problem massive leadership problem. Native Americans. can't sure one dose regiment give people lasting immunity yet. dangerous act confident it. appointments get ""lost"" instead rescheduled? That's fucked. reason shut stop spread virus protect children children much risk. want sell teachers must vaccinated first bullshit need honest accept teacher need vaccinated first parents parents greater risk teacher. tell kid near 6 hours riskier living house kid. Parents closer children teachers teacher need vaccinated safe logic applies parents. 

This babysitting, whole children need schools completely ignored almost year. Yet magically election want reopen schools ASAP... risk always probably higher since virus wide spread 12 months ago.  possible truth never much risk manufactured sway election? Heard! Well cast herd. time. Exactly. People often like tell things want hear. Even truth. virus care people's feelings let spread will. anyone starts thinking ridiculous China this, ask - different conservative media US pushing theory China manufactured virus purposefully biowarfare? instances criticized, making point America exceptional front means. really know does. 95% confidence interval something ridiculous like 68%–95%. wish they'd done separate trial one dose could know better. like data! sub gets trolled hard right Yeah ok need switch 1 dose asap Guess I... heard wrong. mean there's places like Florida Sweden lockdown hard lot dead there. really seem case real world even seems like doctor put email back April basically think covid, come in. We're going send home tell rest get lots fluids (this testing widely available) . wondering protect yourself, always good idea start eating healthier make sure taking good bevy vitamins. us overweight vitamin deficient, advice pretty universally applicable. amount people per capita die get infected Florida California Florida open months California still locked down? Avoid incivility. It’s information. could give ifr would complete guess since way tell accurately ifr is. 

Asymptomatic cases may 10-40% would make ifr arojnd 1.6 %.  Still insanely high. seen wife since february 2020, never replace lost time either. Yes, absolutely whatevs long shits get control, people losing lives covid, lot people dying hospitals overrun people losing jobs. year, big fucking deal.

The fact think right see LDR others people's right healthy live, right get shit right livelihood, life somehow worth others young, shows lack basic empathy.

Your situation sucks think free travel another country provided quarantine solution dismiss people's life think thay somehow important want fuck ldr partner. 

I'm sure depressed maybe even suicidal want know, unlike people might depressed due lockdown, issues show clear signs undiagnosed histrionic personality disorder. Covid cherry top. hope get treated, sake everyone else put you. think lot people forgetting high overlap essential workers trials, many also getting tested regularly work purposes. means chance asymptomatic cases found trials would included overall efficacy calculations.

In theory, kinda. There's neutralizing antibodies too, would provide sterilizing immunity- aka, circulating destroying virus contact really multiply. Likely mRNA's theorized, needs detection nose upper respiratory system seems weak point detection. one holds breath they’re gonna take drink something public now?

I think am. Holy shit people don’t even try.

Breathe in, lift mask, insert food/drink, lower mask, breathe out. studies done already want government dollars Yep estimation one way check calculate number different ways, what's interesting end pretty similar. 

I think 70% exposure yet although chance people either naturally immune naturally get sick. 40% exposure 10-20% natural immunity plus 10-15% vaccinations might close 70%. would explain precipitous drop cases started weeks ago.

I think also need account fact fatality counts 100% accurate. whole topic way fatalities counted changed different areas, despite best efforts sure variance there. allege kind conspiracy like lot people say wonder could possibly count accurately. Add fact 40% fatalities occur nursing homes already 1000-2000 fatalities per day. could significant counting that.

I feel future patient analysis done find Covid fatality rate around 0.25% 100 1000 times higher certain populations (elderly health conditions) 100 1000 times lower others (young healthy), largest problem contagious difficult detect was. eventually estimated 20% population Swine Flu think going end 60%+ infected virus. deadly per se, way contagious. common though? far, seems like reinfection rare, would suggest majority people get strong immunity least half year 9 month (we shall see it'll play future). claim tested work. test thing first, think bring market first: storing ultra low temperature two doses. 

Now try different configurations see else work. Ugh. again.

There absolutely nothing would match concept terrorism.

The two literally nothing common.

Terrorism requires:

* Prior knowledge: can’t accidentally commit terrorism. They’d know sick.

* Intent: intent cause purposeful violence. would actively *trying* get others sick 

* goal inciting fear. can’t quietly commit terrorism.

* political, social religious cause. They’d kill non Christians, gays, libs, something like that.

Literally thing bio terror common presence virus. hope so. in-laws driving insane manipulative emotional pleas getting together going move never see us. never take precautions want use masks, right pandemic.  willing take vaccine . seems silly long ago took year half, took decade. took like six months covid? I'm confused. I've seen articles studies stating 60%, 85%, 92% 93% effective? differences negligible. effective it? Yes that's say efficiency 95% 100%. Totally expected normal. articles kids went back school fall. You’re relying old data. Everything posted studies included data millions kids went back in-person learning fall.

I understand disdain CDC WHO, several studies provided? I've noticing far people letting things go head recently. really think sarcasm lost punch last years. look recent CDC number distribution administration, see produced tested vaccine doses going patients' arms pretty rapidly, least far larger extent start January. Production seems become main bottleneck now.  no, restrictions ruin futures millions people. 

And yes restrictions US Europe empirically demonstrated effectiveness reducing spread, hospitalizations, deaths. can't say numbers zero restrictions help. percent federal budget, $4B someone makes $50K buying two boxes Girl Scout cookies. takes longer six weeks vaccinate entire populations scale especially healthcare infrastructure overwhelmed escape mutation.

I know lot people committed one dose idea, would encourage listen interview virologist Dr. Paul Bienasz high-level overview isn’t great miss *not* pay attention people around wearing. me, weren’t whole lot people concerned vaccines “rushed”. Yet see people want apply untested application schedules doses.

Could work? Sure. could also fail miserably. simply don’t know. could test controlled group, would probably take longer vaccinating everyone current schedule.

But stop there? 1/2 dose. Maybe 1/10th do. Maybe give twice dose once. /s -80 freezers expensive incredibly common hospitals, research labs, etc. know onr hospital near buy single new freezer, reallocated space existing freezers. 'Ukraine' 'the [[BBC [[Reuters boop I’m bot) Must missed headline Ukraine joining EU. You’re alone. vaccine appointment scheduled Feb 1, state changed criteria allowed get shots early part phase 2 dropped appointment. Now, they’re opening changed criteria making longer eligible. thought going Feb 1, going April earliest. thing describe pandemic China’s fault? Interesting, thanks. 

In Southern Germany, increased mobility last weeks. Outdoor mask wearing something like 30 60% university towns like Freiburg, Heidelberg Tübingen, bit better worse rural towns villages, depends time day local trends. Looks bit like young people wear masks often, hunch. Mask quota good shops, gas stations such, looks like 20-40% enforced quite thoroughly. 90%+x efficacy masks seen frequently now. know much offices, switched company remote back Wuhan locked down, customers bit later.

My younger contacts skipping bending rules, 50+ aged business contacts largely isolating since second wave. 

For medical professionals know privately, say use disinfection masks, 50% invest minimizing patient contacts clean indoor air. really believe aerosol transmission frequent. I’m epidemiologist... hazard guess:

If taken measures all, lot people would dead.  [http://www.covidvaccinetrack.com/](http://www.covidvaccinetrack.com/)

More like 0.74%.

It's start better. Well normal contextual. new normal way normal changes time. 

For instance, everyone taught stranger danger, go stranger etc, use uber get randomers car time without batting eye. Speak yourself, (France) exactly last summer. get normal summer 2022. lot like lockdown here. get one chance really get right. mess up, work done almost worthless.

We're close past worst already seeing positive early returns. I'd take cautious approach stick initial plan. Nah, got take account fraction population already COVID (mostly 20% 50%, depending country). Moreover, individuals likely catch spread it, also likely now.

I think vaccines really get going, we'll done epidemic couple months most. fumble wind rollout process waste doses. Morals I'd favor opening now. idea schools essentially zero risk operate implies they're important. would hate mod sub fair. popular sentiment basically ""anything say full normal summer fake news"". mod that? 1 3? talk one point couple years ago Rays relocating Montreal, recall correctly. I’m going get shows protection 28 days that's tested for, that's long lasts. long lasts. study, analysis, look individual studies s/he used make estimate. see serious criticisms scientists commenting. idea purposely infect, volunteers obviously, anyone wanted infected way build herd immunity. back late spring/early summer seemed like vaccines might take year.

Overall worst idea. voluntary, quarantine people hotels large buildings duration infection. Anyone gets seriously ill moved better medical facility. probably end large percentage young people saying 'fuck it' move this.  knows, might saved lives early prevented winter surge.

Obviously, mRNA tech sort thing probably pointless next time around would probably able push vaccine 6 months. User name checks “they one sub intelligent, rational beings logic, like me, another blind slavering masses, like you”

never change, reddit. Exactly lockdown fanatics wanted. risks decisions. difference 2 week second dosage vs. 12 week second dosage person delay immunity unvaccinated person B 12 weeks (10 weeks delay + 2 weeks vaccine action time). 

Even immunity drops say 50% 4 weeks person A, 85% immunity person B. 


You cannot increase immunity person without maintaining person B's zero longer.

Someone analyze data people taken vaccine 12 weeks after, see worth slack. giving Pfizer though, mostly using AZ?

I think ever much doubt would pay short term, know long immunity lasts without second dose. 6 months re-vaccinate everyone people got first dose started dropping dead virus success story. question: 

If vaccine reduces spread reduced viral load elimination symptoms, suggest people without symptoms likely spread virus, without vaccine?

Weren't lot restrictions based people without symptoms spreading virus? ""100% normal"" zoom classes past year disagree :/ scientific consensus states virus originated Wuhan

Is actually scientific consensus? horseshoe bats native Wuhan. Wuhan first outbreak, could easily see brought rural areas bats common.

And cite lab Wuhan reason, would circular logic say 'because believe came Wuhan, lab likely culpable'. insanely good news means one dose already offers adequate protection, thereby doubling amount possible Pfizer vaccinations? called following pandemic handbook last several administrations available No, they’re claiming *weather emergency* stymied reporting. Now, cold weather effectively working shutdown would cases seem falling seasonal peak. 

Cases rose everywhere initially weather got colder, scientists warned everyone 12 months beforehand would case. That’s happened. now, like last spring-ish, cases beginning stall. 

It’s almost like it’s seasonally affected. Who’da thunk? ;) doubt Soros money ya'll sitting pretty. Some* it’s proven effective longer spacing. Patriot Act? we're going honest, government give two shits civil liberties push comes shove. say they're lockdowns consideration liberties they're using talking point justify political ends they've decided already; bet covid actually serious threat political elite class government talking nonsense caring people's freedom would enact martial law put Wuhan-level lockdown flash. Maybe law state makes COVID regulations apply properties zoned certain way... like commercial properties residential one... want variance based that? guess. Betting house 00 hunch winning make right. makes lucky idiot

And even first bet kind done, forgotten attempts gain herd immunity acting irresponsible. Thanks backup friend!

Even Cuomo everything power reopen things like theaters. Newsom last governor relax restrictions think come even sooner expected facing recall states seeing economies roar back. rushed, ship minimum viable product optimize later. tested developed using safest temps. Experimenting temp might caused failed product delays. educated guess hunch. based existing knowledge expectations new knowledge conform it. making like bunch random eejits sitting round table. 

This decision taken MHRA UK. know they're doing. 

The issue around right people still claiming 'we know vaccines stop transmission' Well yes know 100% everything know take educated guess will. 

Like previous poster said - many people stuck analysis paralysis. Hungary. 3rd wave apperently weird witness geopolitical ""No you"" right eyes. long stored normal freezers? Thanks response possible objections

Regarding masks 100% effective, relate point? Even everyone wears mask (the current mandate), 100% effective. Unless show double mask one party less effective single mask two parties, hold water.

As per article, wearing surgical mask cloth mask acts N95, wear actual N95. I’m paper suggests viral loads reduced 75%. It’s great information reassuring vaccine bring form normalcy next year.  evidence good protection week 3-6 good overall protection 6 weeks shots?
As far understood, biggest problem done, study data available. world right limited supply No, doesn’t, changes math. 

If 20% potential reinfect means immunePop= previouslyInfectedPop x 0.8 + vaccinatedPop x vaccineEffectiveness

Math doesn’t stop working changed initial conditions  tho? January 8th 845,000 cases worldwide, February 15th 265,000 cases worldwide. Global infections atleast 50% nobody knows tf pronounce BioNTech Nonsense. get plenty kickbacks shills are. least told users. I’m really curious study wasn’t conducted earlier. answers seem find reason efficacy essentially reduces to: 2 better 1. it’s really simple, weren’t told beginning? feel like could much better protected people would assume that’s mask (since many westerners new concept anyway). 

I feel like sort late game make suggestion like this. 990 million more. great job production quarantine 2 weeks. Hell, 3 weeks would make feel better. Yea, state individually lock point short term. nothing coordinated nationwide guess point, meaning everyone kind working other. 

But look numbers lockdowns happening, absolutely keeping numbers lower. soon restrictions lifted numbers spun control most. mean kinda problem us healthcare general. People can't afford care less healthy get deprioritized means need expensive urgent care later on. Everyone would better healthcare system stopped stratified. here. We're going lock certainly take precautions. fly, take kid indoor gathering, go mask free public spaces kid vaccinated. big deal life changing make accommodations him. think downvoted that. People, includes children, get coronavirus get sick, immune reactions, vascular cognitive issues.

We plan host outdoor parties outdoor gatherings. son meets friends playground almost every day goes school precautions including masks. planning summer vacation place drive rent cabin already bucket list anyway. grand time continuing precautions. Well fair... Spanish Flu drastically changed society. Besides fact lead Roaring 20s (amnesiac historians attributed WWI economic boom, Flu getting credit well), also led permanent changes personal hygiene eventually, annual flu shots.

After TB, household AC units installed building codes started require ventilation.

After cholera, cities installed sewers indoor plumbing people started washing hands using bathroom.

After Black Death, entire world changed. don’t really know sample size time differences vaccines affect immunity. Look, went back watched again. also checked cnn reporting would like make counter claims well sourced are, welcome so. WeSTernERS ProPAGanDa!!!

...Then nobody take seriously lose pr war seem waging. troll trolling lulz. case... idk... great job? odds least one shouldn’t gotten (or asymptomatic)

true, seems quite unlucky 😟 Getting virus control gets people back arenas. can’t play front seats forever. let type real slow ya:

how. long. does. protection. from. that. initial. dose. last. and. tell. me. how. that. proves. waiting. 90. days. is. as. safe. and. as. effective. get tested? Cause heard even mild cases leave damaging effects inside body. quote isn’t article, article covers J&amp;J, AZ, Novavax…

The article South Africa, country 0 Pfizer vaccines. good idea make something mandatory properly tested/studied even year? would agree vaccine around like 10 years side effects studied. Cuomo, Newsom, Murphy would call CDC schizophrenic tried push narrative say it’s Trump holdovers abusing power. 

Looking way turn masks issue personal risk assessment 11 months isn’t worth it. First, masks don’t offer 100% protection, better safe sorry. Second, drastically changing protocols point would cause backlash confusion. best option stick works remaining 9-12 months pandemic, that’s everyone wearing masks.  one sees fantasy? newer deadlier variants ate gonna make last year's problems look mild. likely heading stricter lockdowns economic collapse. reality. They're claiming winter weather driving drop cases.

But Canada warned winter weather would drive rise cases. see incoherent impractical all. also never late propose ideas improve public health.

It's pretty straightforward, ""wear type mask want protect virus"". mandate required, everyone masks personal choice, one harmed anyone else's choice. Win-win-win. kid cold shortly Christmas. He's school I'm pretty sure picked caught him. Apart school barely leave home all. first time I'd cold year, awesome, NGL. possible. could also things. Cases rising Poland, can't dealing again... keep seeing articles studies ""demonstrating"" second dose delayed studies looking efficacy around time currently-prescribed second dose. proving effective day 21-28 demonstrate delay 42 (or case UK, 84)? probably wane 92% 15% day 50 anything could well wane enough 12 weeks concern. get data that, guessing/assuming. Also, clear phase I/II trials antibody levels booster significantly higher mRNA vaccines. place going *only* single dose making risky move. *delayed* second dose probably less risky, 12 weeks without data support seems fairly risky well.

In US, changing policy big gamble. mere weeks away surge supply talking something like 20 million additional first doses, also consider change policy based incomplete data would influence substantial group people borderline hesitant vaccine feel there's enough time/data. Would make hesitate enough offset 20 million people get weeks earlier? knows, gamble. opinion, anything erodes trust vaccines worth point. week two might eating words, right feel like urgency get first doses might thought January. comment linking openvaers.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Also nausea dizziness like day mild headache. that's it. feel better today though stomach still bothering bit.  US already ahead Europe per capita deaths, including France Spain, gap getting wider. probably going pass Italy next month, countries Europe worse per capita rate UK, Belgium, extremely small countries per capita numbers really reflect situation well. UK Belgium examples effective lockdown strategies botched responses point, better really saying anything. Ha. He’s voter. Health restrictions political decisions. That’s gets lost this. 
I saw gov Ohio praising masks might saying kids could proms glory. Right. Kids masked going prom. Let know goes you. Ohio.

Right Fauci saying go back restaurants fall. Ummm even Chicago opened restaurants dropped rules. 

Name governor that’s going run platform social distancing next year. Besides CA NY. They’ll crazy town know what, cares. They’ll lose population realize people aren’t signing crap. went laws ended getting covid one’s surprise absolutely justified seeing them. risked everyone else family get together 3 days FIL tested positive refused go to. also live MIL’s 89 year old grandmother literally lock room pretty much constantly even covid+ wouldn’t wear masks around “Why home”? FIL almost hospitalized 85 able get monoclonal antibodies doctor made full recovery. sincerely believe hadn’t gotten treatment would’ve different outcome. 

Anyway, they’re recovered they’re using manipulate us getting together “we wasn’t bad” “half us immune”. Well we’re I’m going one year old’s birthday party wait months get vaccines. Sorry rant lol hope things work everyone situation. whole thing really revealed lot people lives. What? never said anything mandate, quite opposite actually. said anyone wants protected wear two masks, anti-maskers go around without harming anyone. know they're recommending it....I know would able extended period time. genuinely uncomfortable hour, I'm someone fine wearing mask day normally. That's true. lot science behind it, test specifically. ask literally anyone field, they'll tell would hugely surprising--to extent even able explain why--if reduce transmission. known would reduce transmission. question much, whether vaccinated person rely that. even that, vaccinated person spread it, they'll still spread lower amount virus, meaning would cause fewer severe cases. NYT article morning goes depth Would nice data, choice made limited information even offering people limited immunity short time reinforcing preferable holding people 0 immunity amount time. think apply sell half many doses? guys adjusted number vials regulators approved 6 doses/vial? Absolutely.... 2022. can’t exactly start making abandoned warehouse.

High manufacturing sites (aerospace, medical, semiconductor, etc) often take half decade get running. amount work involved mind boggling. Hundreds thousands miles cable pipe wire. It’s insane. Even worst preforming US state still better overwhelming majority countries. Even 2/3 protection still slow spread Yeah, see you’re saying. I’m sure answer is, hopefully end soon enough. guys total blockade. responsible vaccination since country created conditions suffer That's racist. Last one here, please turn light!  give credit making educated guess.

No, really shouldn't. Betting house 00 hunch winning make right. makes lucky thing US government kept saying there’s evidence masks work. Every often use common sense.

Because wasn't. classic results-oriented thinking conflating origins spread.  think we're late game suggesting that. going implement public health orders, need clear-cut easy people interpret follow, also easy enforce. ""Double-mask feel like it, also wear mask all"" incoherent. Either mask mandate don't. need agree long mandate place end. Otherwise people gonna confused. entire US locked point. Even Florida lockdown March/April last year. states like California New York two biggest states strict lockdowns. Despite done worse sweden none. think millions people lost jobs homes lost businesses they've spent whole lives building government restrictions would agree we've lockdowns here. Yeah, there's preprint study Israeli Ministry Health Pfizer claiming vaccine may nearly 90% effective reducing transmission. becoming apparent data we're seeing mRNA vaccines severly mitigate spread virus well. Maybe cars falling tracks state like mine. say everything. said article. point shooting messenger...  initial data Pfizer Moderna showed conclusions effective one dose regiment would be. think people died New York justifies argument?

People going die second hit world. experts article. Happy reading! Technically, still correct. Masks work well trying protect yourself. work great containing spew high societal uptake, curbing spread.

You might say ""everyone knows this"" literally every anti masker several fence sitters know point wearing mask. complete lack public education matter largest screw pandemic I'd say. time Zakhor Anti-maskers pretending annoyed Fun Police move safe space, like Somalia, little *gummint* exists prance around freedumbs. Oh yeah I’m vaccinated answer different month ago wouldn’t been, I’ve judged extra harshly year decisions, also living someone high risk. imagine read JCVI reports interested end Annex B. Nothing happen lol Yes cooked? passed immediately returning work, maybe George Foreman grill car sorta situation?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* certain point ""distribution plan"" trouble worth, though. looking like April US covered HCW's, 65+ people serious comorbidities. point, there's enough supply get everyone else matter months, overhead may worth it. Even ones caught breaking laws? masks, social distancing? think people would scared covid?  really see choice particularly meaningful me, presents risk options tradeoff make much sense. feel like personally fairly modest risk complications COVID, personally would super negatively affected ""living another year like past one"" I'm used working home perfectly happy meet people outdoors mind wearing mask much I'm indoors brief periods unable distance. would upset either options neither really gets worst fears. much worried elderly family members catching COVID myself, much worried son getting enough in-person social interaction opportunities friends family able go bars whatever. Even screwing around testing kits early could made much difference. time US even acknowledged virus beyond scattered nursing home outbreaks, already spreading like wildfire one even seriously looking it. Everyone's always going countries like South Korea well lockdowns countries heavy lockdowns still badly, they're usually leaving South Korea need major lockdown detected controlled situation early. Almost without exception countries lockdowns still badly ones started lockdowns virus already control, point late already badly, seen numbers appear yet. Obviously considering many infected asymptomatic, vast majority get minor symptoms ones get I'll mainly dying pneumonia things common seasonal respiratory illnesses.

As going confirmed cases begun spread, doesnt even make sense. Please civil here. dentist CA open since April 2020. Canada’s cases 50%. getting 6,500-7,000 cases day consistently getting around 2,500-3,000 day. literally one repeating information harmful objectively false. *You* piece shit here, fact don’t even realize means every bit stupid rest us think are. understand that. I'm completely opposed anything (not matters was). see finish line ahead makes nervous we'll somehow end shooting foot. do, however, trust scientists experts make right decision end I’ve definitely noticed change here. lot see people saying media, scientists, doctors, politicians, etc lying things bad say want keep restrictions place. may get cast heard though. got vaccinated Wed. side effect Thursday, shoulder felt like someone hit hammer. Today, feels like pushups yesterday.  Would able see people I’m banned seeing now?

I would much rather physically sick little watch mental illness (agoraphobia) get worse another year. Accuse others guilty of. We’ve seen tactic before, pretty obvious stuff. think Fauci conservative estimate, yet seen 25M doses/week. There's still possibility vaccine companies able scale much they're predicting. 

Mid-march probably optimistic unless ""essential worker"" (a surprisingly broad category) significant comorbidity. Mid-April not-unlikely. would surprised later Mid-May. FWIW, take temp yesterday, feel hotter usual. took though 91 F. New evidence China affirming epidemiologists long suspected: coronavirus likely began spreading unnoticed around Wuhan area November 2019, exploded multiple different locations throughout city December.

So China’s coronavirus epidemic originated Wuhan. people seem think efficient public health response done free somehow US government would stepped plate. one remember AIDS pandemic? even recently, things like Katrina Hurricane Maria? country highly inefficient dealing crises involve going war understand anyone expected anything different. previous variants less infectious children immune systems strong able fight off. Americans children next infectious variant getting going need fly Chicago Tuesday fron Texas. take covid-19 test go. website says diagnostic test. However, doesnt specify PCR Rapid test. called airlines airports noone sure. someone elaborate this? move another talking point. people insufferable. Yeah, think it, spreading around Washington State 6 weeks early 2020 hit nursing home people finally noticed. thanks insight u/Dumpster_slut69 Holy shit fuck hurt toxic, consider changing attitude want change life piece shit are. fuck Could explain impacts severe cases? data indicated? look things Poland.

Well, except last sentence. Reddit repeatedly informed allowed criticize China racist. attacking Chinese ethnicity whole, yes - CCP one dangerous evil governments planet. spy, enslave Uighurs, violate rights Tibetans workers, highest emissions country earth. Yet Redditors come droves defend them. baffling. number also South African variant Covid Classic? appreciate lengthy response. like science good science takes time. life actually different except able go festivals live that. Also I'm pretty sure already covid body deal already. I'm willing mostly stay isolated long takes put people's lives risk.

Back topic: pretty much say side effects studied already. wonder think could studied possible side effects fertility less year? far know can't really make babies grow faster. winter might doable, summer thats tall order way I’m innoculating deadly infectious virus Hi! I'm sorry hear experience -- please feel free reach us modmail take look :) AutoMod perfect, we're always trying improve! Depends time range they’re looking at. 60% study looking 1/2 weeks vaccination, whereas one looking longer range. Basically, efficacy increases time know who's downvoting me. Jesus, anti-vax invading sub? That's data saying though. unlikely either become single-dose, able give first potentially twice many people bring back months later supply ample major impact many people admitted hospital die. virus mutates something deadly running younger people? definitely evidence. Search “8 months” sub see many articles studies - checked don’t time read moment don’t want link “blindly”.

I’m trying convince anything - little whole pandemic considered definitive we’ve years years study still need make decisions meantime. wanted inform empirical evidence points towards somewhat long lasting immunity. Germany, although Germany vaccinated way less people. could focused protecting vulnerable, imposing minimal restrictions young healthy  

This realistic solution. think could focused protecting vulnerable? Putting strict lockdowns nursing homes recommending seniors isolate literally one first things done countries pandemic. stop virus spreading like wildfire among people anyway. risk situation changes dealing highly contagious threat; work like ""50% people isolate, 50% take risks, 50% take risks get infected"". like Pareto type distribution small fraction like 20% take risks greatly increases danger everyone else. Trying box population like saying ""only guys need isolate, let people responsible themselves"" simply going effective. really much different restrictions all.

I also dislike idea codifying kind age discrimination law, like mandatory isolation age restrictions otherwise. would probably create lot resentment people around age borderline would also difficult get implemented due controversy policy arguments would cause. I'm willing place label anti-mask sub, maybe yet, bringing curious good point. Lots posts getting upvotes suggest masking wearing useless public health officials full shit. I'm making value determination there, know sentiments would tanked karma 5 months ago. vaccine all? Seeing virus (as antibody) 99.99% effective people 50? bashed berated early pandemic subreddit calling Cuomo resident New York. said happening nobody believed me. look. ""Widely available"" means anyone wants vaccine get one. depend specific number doses distributed completely sure many people want vaccine.

I think Gottlieb's timeline accurate. people say widely available October assuming rate vaccination stays constant, expected increase.

Anything saying ""7 years current rate vaccination"" month two old. rate vaccination much faster then, still going up. make good point, doses sitting around long first place, larger logistical problems investigated. doses likely used matter days, hours. similar studies Sinovac? know September 11th, one EVER rode plane again! /s what? guess live everyone around? bullshit article. know next mistake want make.

For government pro-science, required fund scientific projects. see contradiction regime pro-science, feeling research finding cure baldness left private sector fund do.

But part stubbornly get. regime sudden decides baldness gift God, makes research baldness illegal, arrests murders scientists study baldness, guess what? regime anti-science. matter regime otherwise space program. fact regime used violence even scientists, actively stiffle science, makes anti-science.

Again, authoritarian regimes actively support fund scientists intellectuals. that, nature, authoritarian regimes ultimately commit violence scientists intellectuals, order silence them. makes anti-science anti-intellectual. You’re right. thought 10 minutes first. who

People danger others?

But really, people due socioeconomic situations may access vaccines. done business China know bribes part everyday business. doubts CCP would extend bribes international organizations. fact points positives Chinas response negatives alone raises question, why? Even unnamed lower level workers questioned releases read like CCP propaganda. Tl;dr? definitely one seeing something fantasy... Agreed. many people completely convinced we're going locked inside another full year, minimum. people going really struggle bars/music venues/stadiums start open full capacity within next 6-8 months (possibly sooner!). suspect us friends/family see while, even we're vaxxed. also folks able readjust back normal life struggle rest lives. 

I obviously hope case, seems quite likely evidence single dose vaccine would confer enough level immunity long enough make dose scheme would effective two dose scheme. Guessing single dose non-zero effectiveness educated guess based existing knowledge sound reasoning. Guessing single dose scheme would effective two dose scheme hunch day 14 1st dose, 90+% effective. studies saw started counting that. I'll edit momentarily link explaining data/timeline/efficacy.

edit:  Read comments irrational provisionally accept hypothesis pending information basis decision could save thousands lives. sure. Florida's age now, condition. Europe fucked essentially, vaccine roll-out joke, many countries indefinite lockdowns can't see ending Easter earliest (probably start summer many countries) everyone mother finding new variants fresh nail coffin return normal, regardless actual impact. 

As far know, government concrete plan returning normal restrictions (if anyone knows more, please let know), hand-wringing ""oh vaccinate enough population"" vague promises ""normalization"" ""almost normal"" point, maybe, later year - that's big fat maybe.

I envy Americans, they'll likely enjoy summer exactly like described article Europe still dealing inane restrictions, media screaming 4234th variant discovered god-knows stupid fucking thing come time summer rolls around. point I've lost hope we'll see anything close normality year, vaccines (regardless great are) change damn thing restriction-wise, future might've fucking gutter there's fucking point living anymore. definitely is, removes strain bring people back second dose weeks later, also means impressive immune responses 14 days.

This taken mean BioNTech vaccine become single dose regimen, able use larger proportion supply first doses instead keep 50% reserve means far people protected. 

As scientists already said, better current context give 10 people 80-90% chance protected compared giving 5 people 90-95% chance. It’s variance Colorado’s COVID dial restrictions, zoning variance. allow operate higher capacity standard rules outdoor events businesses. far off. antibody rate much Manhattan low/mid teens. literally densest part densest city country.

Mod: ""Alright post multiple issues. title issue fair enough, staying link nyt. limnked AMP."" (So despite allowing one time earlier, rescinded--fair enough guess but)

Me: ""Okay linked nyt. yo please approve since link takes nyt article?"" (I mean, would accepted no, since approved earlier thought I'd ask)

Mod: ""For last time, no, not, no, not.""

28 day mute. Lol next thing gonna say gonna repost right link. Nobody would share cold year. risk quarantine nothing high Shhhh fit fear mongering media agenda real difference 85 92 - that's noise. 60 seems outlier. CDC anyone estimate undercounted covid cases worldwide? social distance much like 10 days get second dose, I'm done shit. niece nurse. knows many nurses they're refusing get seeing what's it. they're allowed say public. see value public health efforts pursue

Because faulty inefficient. Americans treat masks like kind magical weapon put eggs one basket lot easier force people wear masks go get government pay businesses close make sure people cared lockdowns.

If actually study countries--and no, Australia--handled COVID, look everything hyperfocus masks, see terrible public health response been. stop blaming people getting frustrated ""restrictions"" get results.

And anyone says anything, yes, masks help silver bullet people want be. Soviet Russia, Serge gets behind you! pulled thought useless?  No, really doubting. seems like it’s essentially fool proof method properly mask means stronger seal better air filtration. But, asked 5 year old 2 masks better 1, they’d say yes. investigated earlier? study conducted CDC seemed pretty basic. 2.5 million confirmed deaths. Given global demographics (age distribution), [global IFR probably around (that's conservative given global population skews young relative US Europe IFR estimated .3-.5%).

Even ignoring death under-reporting developing (crap, even developed - US others likely missed least 10% COVID-related deaths), puts **floor** cases 800 million. Combined under-reporting deaths developing countries easy see least 1 billion global infections. 1 billion floor; probably higher. *sips tea*

and Canadian snowbirds flew get vaccine. Yep, comes whether start vaccinating super cold freezers December wait month 2 see use regular freezers endpoints. mean it'll work. reason clinical trials. certainly mean it'll work better two-dose scheme protect population Someone talks 'one dose regiment [sic]' unlikely views vaccination well informed members JCVI. According Minister Health, proportion b117 daily new infections 22%. currently like calm storm. I'm sure. seems like support restrictions among younger demographics older demographics. risk covid start get high get pretty old, like 70+. lot people 70's 80's know might much time left, want spend loved ones rather sitting front screen. reason delayed getting second dose? Elderly/immune compromised already vaccinated. I'm risk averse you, seems, momentary lapse judgment. anyone disagrees this, consider society based around reducing death. consideration, achieved costs. guarantee almost one would want live society. 

It’s enough live, something live for. must balanced. Right lot people feel nothing live for. confused

It's working. 

At something mentally break down. win point. 

Seriously since beginning masks yes masks followed shut shut followed double mask heck triple mask (after fauci said double triple masks ineffective) pres vice pres saying trust vaccine considering making everyone take it. kids going school nkw going school, teachers need vaccinated teachers must vaccinated. never going stop. People scared confused help need confused frustrated attempt find truth. 
You'll prolly judge laugh whatever really care hope breaking point late. 
The numbers dropping dramatically well. think covid gone restrictions set place stay know ever want rona come back. 

God speed hope point higher-ups stop playing game us. 

Oh yeah kne last thing. Remember cuomo God handling covid? Turns he's devil caused deaths early kn sole actions tried cover even threatening journalists. 

Please wake up. God speed vaccines made covid-19 based existing vaccine technology. plenty existing knowledge. I’m little apprehensive even though I’m vaccinated wife son not. want things go safe activities don’t know safe wife son. 100% Pretty much country's leadership approaching reducing death consideration. countries highly reluctant impose lockdown measures, usually virus control options looked like would help. Also, we're trying stop spread want prevent deaths nonsense, without mitigation idea upper limit would be. March 2020, one could say would kill 100,000 own, maybe would kill 10 million; gambling would completely irresponsible. That's reacted strongly this, ways even enough. ***developing*** vaccine ***producing*** vast quantities it.

&amp;#x200B;

take, example, flu vaccine every year.. 

it's made chicken eggs.. 

it takes lot time 

**Super Top Secret US Government Chickens**

 lay them.

&amp;#x200B;

no amount money makes chickens make eggs faster.

takes year.

&amp;#x200B;

**The US keeps millions chickens secret farms make flu vaccines. eggs work America's hidden chickens.** Across United States, potentially millions chickens laying eggs every day, year-round, flu vaccines. According CNN, recent **flu** season alone (to end February), ***140 million eggs could used vaccines.***

&amp;#x200B;

you might literally GROW shit bioreactor. (for vaccines use live attenuated virus)

&amp;#x200B;

no amount money makes things grow faster.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bioreactor concepts cell culture-based viral vaccine Hmmm well, displays temp A/C point air vents, figured working lol. essential workers like grocery restaurant staff vaccinated, I'm fine going ""choose risk"" model safety precautions. then, need keep mind choosing level risk, choosing them. want study progression generation antibodies. think share data lot news articles take number without details story. news article say - Pfizer x% effective first dose. don’t blame anymore misreading that. time points important understand broad scale progression antibodies generated vaccine. mean, think agree saying I'm 100% sure. question could handled better leadership. don’t buy exact reasoning think you’re close. Children always able get it. Whether symptomatic cases different. 

Are saying they’re likely symptomatic case? case yes I’d agree. Yeah, ""cheap"" grocery store, they're 2 $3 right now. even get started price berries. afford buy kids bag chips, blame can't. 

Also food quality deteriorated significantly (too many preservatives, etc). great news formula hard part. Making mRNA kinda hard, hard. Making lipid nanoparticles kinda hard, hard. turns hard part getting mRNA lipid nanoparticles. requires extremely specialized equipment.  I’m nowhere close getting vaccine. I’ve 4 year old’s playmate 11 months now. state almost last vaccine roll out. They’ve prioritized rural areas none left cities. I’m so, tired. It’s even close done me. live NJ. town, mask compliance indoors high outdoors 50/50 seems like people make bigger effort stay away see wearing mask outdoors. think premise essentially right, would add caveat: amount death always inevitable.

The saddest critical example overall infant mortality. substantially, massive reduce measures like maternal health screening, pre-natal check ups, trained doctors nurses midwives, sanitation, vaccines, etc., unfortunately number approach zero. rate never nothing-- 

&amp;#x200B;

You spend money/resources/efforts bring infant mortality down. probably spend infinite resources attempting reduce zero. Okay thank appreciate fast reply.  Venn diagram redditors high karma, antisocial fearful introverts, consumers algorithm fed information circle. opening year then? lancet says alot things idea. took mine Weds got results Friday state goal turning results around 72 hours. Ok, February, that's 3-4 months limited supply pretty much certain drops cases driven vaccine. several states Midwest, rapid drops began back November December even vaccination. Basically, states started fall wave earliest fell back earliest. Rapid drops began mid January rest states, TINY fraction vaccinated. Vaccines bring us decrease cases. Hey... reading comment. feel shiver running back? It’s called hope. know haven’t felt since mess started year ago. didn’t call terrorists, I’m pointing comment terrible albuterol save us oof. likely circulation issue? what's good/hopeful ""normal summer/fall"" news week fellas? checked thread while. Gu's projections continue seem promising. That’s really good point- people haven’t even chance even approach question get it’s available- won’t while. numbers perspective could take months years get everyone vaccinated. think often think short time scales. process vaccinating public going take long time impact lives process. least conversation needs deserves had. vaccine passport forced government fiat result inequality. 

On another note think sense dread, totally shot itself, financial implications people don’t get (or mainly can’t get yet) businesses could allow inside thus force pay products delivery costs, stinks lots people aren’t exactly making ton money right now. way could argued would create additional “tax” top goods, outright denial services, result situation control (being shots simply available yet). Making different people pay different prices access products services least push us road towards discrimination case. 

I totally support need get vaccine, think Johnson Johnson one interesting potential, also hear issues challenges arise live complex society complex democracy. question whether beneficial one person get shots one wait bivalent booster, guess better get shots time wait booster become available, way early tell. Younger adults without health conditions even getting vaccine months. might info protective current vaccines variants, bivalent mRNA shots would likely available market, would get prioritized bivalent shots (young healthy person one dose vs older people two). possible become moot point April.

If question instead ""should government delay second doses young healthy people everyone vaccinated"", seems like reasonable proposition, individual choice. No, droplets slowed cloth mask wearing. again, year this, **a mask protects droplets getting peoples' eyes, nose mouth.** surgical mask N95 also protects wearer's mouth nose others' spray. Cloth masks less effective, better nothing.

Your mask face first protect people. Kudos Times pointing out. people be. First rule r/coronavirus mod: don’t talk Gates money. Eh, it’s editorial choice. author likely trying provide fairly comprehensive view things could go isn’t really thinking much others pieces publication saying. Ok buddy, call terrorists anger makes feel better lol. Good luck convincing grand jury Oh wow. case probably much time passed since vaccine administered.  idea protect vulnerable, 70 already received first dose, really think need protect caregivers, teachers children us. lived lives. Give opportunity live confidence. Look post comment history lol Shut up. Like shut up. Tears welled eyes. Trying realistic literally couldn’t contain excitement even doesn’t happen. Little things life guess.  Right now, anyone healthy 65 first dose Yes: moment get vaccine, protect all. effective percentage **&lt;5%.** body reacts next days, develop protection, end first week vaccine might **50 60% effective**. 

After 2 weeks body done reacting first dose might top **85% effective.** get second dose, body reacts (often harder) makes defenses virus. **two weeks second vaccine goes 85% effective 95%** effective. 

That's different numbers keep coming up. It’ll get 23%, give time. 2x rapid antigen tests make sense.

PCR tests 99.99\~ accurate expensive administer issues false positives, especially cycles cranked up.

Rapid antigen tests 95% accurate, much faster, cost couple dollars suffer problem false positives. You’re worrying way much upvotes downvotes. Especially another’s behalf. Yes would make sense, think states US going change currently recommended guidelines especially JNJ expected approved soon. That's fantastic! Hope everything works :) presenting new point. previous statement allude time. mentioned food cost. I'm refuting food cost barrier. 

Time issue. Food cost not. show prep weeks worth food hours also. It’s hard know believe. getting downvoted, understand saying - taking risk modify process seems working better time already.

I think might agree single-dose versus double-dose - looks like they're going manufacture enough give everyone two doses, might make sense take time run full trial 1-dose regimen. would sign study gave 50/50 chance getting 1-dose versus 2-dose regimen.

As far storage temperatures, manufacturers experimenting probably since beginning trials, could afford take time gather months worth data, rather weeks, precisely everyone willing move Heaven Earth make complicated logistic chain work figured necessary.

Now they've got data showing simpler logistics chain work, make process even better, let us get shots arms, especially rural areas. could even open mRNA vaccines used poor countries without ultra-cold logistics chain. Still bit genuine criticism. would variants keep escaping vaccine induced immunity mRNA vaccines without eventually mutating detrimental changes spike protein ? attitude prevalence shows Americans definitely learn nothing this. blame problems countries, Russia, China, Venezuela, Iran, on. embrace Chinese belt road plan integrate it, Americans think moral high ground (this let half million people die covid). Bell peppers definitely $1.69/lb. here. Red bells $1.49 cheaper stores (LCOL City Midwest) federal government authority full lock months would take? 

If introduced travel restrictions quarantining like Taiwan early on, needed full-scale national lockdown.

Hell, could locked Washington spreading still needed national lockdown. I've seen reports we'll 100000 daily April continue lockdown . Thats true, since I'm today fly Tuesday hope get time. know long take? also winter storm problems Texas. acting research validation ever vindication? could gone way. point. I’m merely demonstrating cases around 50% height surge Give COVID sure. I've seen. would interested seeing too. Interesting, wearing cloth masks coughed face, would eyes protected case? compelling arguments. numbers published reputable source like government disease department, major news outlet? Agreed. unfortunate sub seems practice many anti-scientific/fact based argumentation critiqued months ago. 

Like seems like go on, comments sub start getting far away reasonability. blows mind literally vaccinating folks now, finish line sight. someone got first dose yesterday, cool see. ""....the young, pregnant can't jab medical reasons."" There's summary link. initial shot zero.

By time get second shot goes around 90%.

You get second shot. still 90%.

Over next two weeks go 94% whatever max is.


At time one knows year later goes back zero whatever. really needed this. Brought tears eyes. targeted towards vulnerable, like people health measures offer next help vulnerable forces work Applebee's lose health insurance homeless

One solution could save lives, results 500,000 deaths. would prefer? know sick (they positive test read article), idea intent was, could anti maskers pushing their... wait it... anti mask POLITICAL agenda popular technique despotic countries since *at least* cold war.

Thank you! feel like people sub losing minds willing risk anything “normal” summer. think you’re misinterpreting data. 

I’m not. Read it. It’s super simple understand get weekly two-week averages, give accurate views actual trends time.

Canada still higher surge began, cases actually ticked slightly past week. sure data supports unfortunately. doses could spaced three months, would huge. Vaccination campaigns could fan quickly, come later give everyone booster. US could achieve vaccinated end May instead end end July, example. already is. Netflix made mockumentary called ""Death 2020"", directed Charlie Brooker, made black mirror end EU burocrats screwing up? Similar contracts, key clauses, EU signed pne day earlier?. simply company choosing serve first contract signed later? Yes. point obvious. get fat poor. There's actually ton incredibly cheap produce poor people afford. Also, poorest US eligible food stamps. get incredible haul veggies (fresh frozen) program. Also, whipping dinner take much 20 minutes skills widely available youtube.

Redditors love parrot utter nonsense obesity inevitable poor working class within America. pure idiocy. 

I could easily make healthy dinner family four $10 everyone else. 

Yet acting like poor people helpless children evil system stuffing full mcdoubles baja blast made balloon 350 lbs. cant sure two dose either.. what's obvious delay dose 2. give 60 days doses, save tens thousands lives Seems me. Making serious accusations something without real evidence. Media countries it. think important keep context. I'm going lie, piece filled hope felt quite awhile. 

*If holds true, would mean many aspects pre-pandemic life return even summer upon us. case numbers guide local policies, much country could soon reason lift many even restrictions distancing, gathering, masking. Pre-pandemic norms could return schools, churches, restaurants. Sports, theater, cultural events could resume. People could travel dance indoors hug grandparents, others’. U.S., summer could feel … “normal.”*

Music ears. course ^/s sure undercount miscount. Different areas used different policies different times. Like UK recently changed policy deceased tested positive within 28 days call covid death. obviously false positives negatives, someone tested, someone died something clearly unrelated like car accident. change caused numbers revised downwards, counting before, counting now?

The average time admittance death nursing home 5 13 months average covid fatality 3 serious health conditions. see determine accurately. anecdotes someone flu dying heart attack called heart attack, someone covid dying heart attack called covid. sure happens over.

If 35-40% population exposed would expect higher certain areas, like population centers specific locations within population centers like grocery stores. Like would expect large majority grocery store workers exposed. people like primary way virus spreads immune spread would disproportionately decreased.

It's interesting case counts declining almost everywhere vaccination widespread countries. opinion almost lockdowns half-assed intermittent enough largely meaningless virus basically spreading largely unchecked. like chain letters Ponzi schemes, eventually run people. Flu cases dramatically everywhere, track common cold surprising similar fall. seems precautions partially effective stopping Covid quite sufficient stopping flu respiratory illnesses. know this, that's I'm concerned. actually know risk dying developing long term effects, simply trial long term. people getting it, they're getting sick even dying days later. I'm going take stories guarantee vaccine risky, certainly backing point, I'm going wait see happens review decision time. either way, risk dying covid low, willing live it. Yeah, mean obviously guy OPs post hypocritical, onus corporations governments. like yelling guy wait 6 PM cut grass giving fuck factory air pollution. trust judgement people masquerading seniors. truth hurts Looks like may find default. second Pfyzer dose weather delayed, rescheduled 21st. middle ice snow storm east Texas, it’s likely rescheduled again. today I’m week overdue already. want second dose, I’m concerned delay. I’m 85-93% protected. Anddd published proof Lancet UK. move guy really need sarcasm tags? totally, absolutely 100% true! America resources aid development procurement vaccine, indeed cover providing others.

But admit, also like giving short supply organ donors lung smoker says ""I aint changing thing! I'm gonna live life way want to!"" person got lung cancer fault own, tried live healthy life, lost cus smoker's lungs little bit worse money pay it.

Also, different areas hit differently pandemic. Death tolls uniform. area hit hard elderly population one hospital snot prepared. Yea. People skin game whole time priority. Thanks, kind find whole thing funny  85/92/95% effective terms actually mean? One person 95% covered, there’s 5% chance still catch it? 95% people 100% chance catching it? like W landed plane aircraft carrier ""mission accomplished"" banner Lancet  true sense. craigslist ads. Mostly, though, people making deals elderly neighbors, things like that. thing accounted things like elderly couples would normally gone together going separately family members.

The major downside going take twice long drop 65 older system well, state trying get significant portion 75 older vaccinated 1st. thing happened medical workers made broad, included things like administrators researchers, took extremely long get medical workers vaccinated. college kids working labs vaccinated 75+. state tends low rate antivaxxers, well, ton refusals, good state, bad next line vaccine.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* equivalent situation would vaccine rollout continues slow pace there's significant vaccinated population majority people still unvaccinated. Yes spread somewhat reduced due vaccinated population, still selective pressure put virus evade vaccine. given enough time, could see vaccine-resistant variants.

 That's one big reasons need get shots everyone's arms ASAP also crucial open everything early vaccination process. seen anything that, CDC estimates actual number cases 4.6x higher reported. would put US alone nearly 130 million. mistrust anyone isn't. thanks. I’ll take second dose time, thank you. new variants don’t seem diverging quickly moment. booster end year could provide coverage time. Fingers crossed. actually didn’t downvote singe one comments. 

I’m providing counterpoint. means expert, I’ve given add discussion. comment supposed point? Sounds like blathering me. That's actually kind funny. restrictions actually getting tougher UK, staying same? appreciate hustle. 

California prioritizing distribution vaccines obese (obesity 100% self-caused) adults normal healthy weight, last line result.

i.e. people penalized eating healthy exercising. Maybe ""dress up"" obese move line? Clearly crisis actors deep states Gates. /s never understood Trump Admin wanted create story came Chinese lab first place. truth already worse that. China lets bunch idiots hold infection vector meat markets. already fault! already due negligence! Saying accidently escaped research lab makes less culpable. Sounds right Pfyzer published study.  need test via human challenge trials.

By time efficacy proven via standard trials, late. Preaching choir bit. seem remember majority reddit time criticizing that, too. variant shown vaccine escape. Even reduction efficiency slows spread anything made Japan anymore? updates Paul Offits report 11 12 weeks ago. America donating $4 billion, $2.billion another $2 billion contingent nations participating (donating). administration separately looking donating expected surplus vaccines. agree seasonality really come play population seen virus. 

The way I've thinking virus spread pretty unabated there's population immunity slow people antibodies (or vaccinations case). causes cases slow rate acquiring new antibodies well. 

But there's change environment (i.e. winter seasons) allows transmission, virus pick spread again. environment becomes less favorable transmission, conditions back regular favorability spread, virus even larger immunity. prevalence plummets antibodies start wear population seasons change again. aggressive vaccines last longer boosters, keep coming back next wave.  Pfizer Moderna said 200M end May. (So 400M total vaccines)

That's 200M adults.

Is enough get everyone wants one end May? know. Depends much vaccine acceptance changes next 3 months.

Note: End May also slip end April think decease number ~70M vaccines (35M people) think put pretty firmly ""Not enough everyone wants one unless really poor acceptance rates)

Fortunately, Moderna Pfizer also hook another 200M that, so, yes, they'll able vaccinate every American (children included approval shows up) without help J&amp;J. Allow human challenge trials time.

We need trials completed YESTERDAY. stop second find country willing enslave generations children build shit upper middle class buy stuff don’t need marginally cheaper lower middle class Americans jobs. subjugate China economic model America wants back.  Slavery. Actually, yes. Swedish government using arguments masks debunked, also facing third wave infections right now. know it’s hard conservatives use critical thinking change views based emerging science, know better, little buddy. anyone else feeling kind blue lately? example even vaccine UK restrictions keep getting tougher tougher normality nowhere seen. Cool? Still independent country. lol numbers also relate time since vaccination. numbers appear increase time. I’m stopping precautions kids vaccinated. well billion people infected COVID-19 globally.

[CITATION NEEDED] never really understood either. like 2 week stretch arbitrary businesses shutdown it. Everything else open reopened weeks. seemed kind ridiculous.

What percentage US population non-essential low risk? Maybe 5 10%? I'm providing context, based facts : announced yesterday outdoor festivals allowed, unless seated &lt;5k people tiny fraction total festival crowd France. route clubs, little doubt (would moronic forbid music festivals allow indoor dancing). said, local pharmacy sized -70 freezer US$3-4k.

If that’s aren’t local pharmacies buying renting one? county PA too. federal government authority full lock months would take? doubt it. tried bet would many protests. protests, bet need triple amount police go homes validate happening.

All things considered, full lock continental united states couple weeks pipe dream. Nobody knows work top AZ vaccine. Maybe body think I've already got this, ignore. 

Plus could late then. ass goes tests positive last Sunday. Almost made it! virus still able spread mutates. Think vaccines like population antibiotics.

The last read anything this, Taiwan going around claiming would never buy Vaccines China. Taiwan thrmselves prevented purchase.

So Taiwan saying China somehow ability block buying vaccines countries?

I find hard believe since China can't block Taiwan buying US weapons. hard be, event, pay money, product gets delivered.

So much lying BS floating around. Stop lying. vaccines provide level protection known variants. BMI comorbidity going cause lot drama. impossible really track prediction future fact? time machine? mention amount pollution raising animals fur substantial, too. combined considerations animal suffering, pollution, zoonotic disease risk makes choice abundantly clear IMO. Article behind paywall, can’t really read it. wrong use low IFR. Keep mind someone doctor scientist, infallible. scientist encountered enough bad science people PhDs. need go scientific consensus peer review articles instead newspaper opinion pieces.

At rate, good peer reviewed meta-review article summarizing scientific consensus IFR: piece anecdotal evidence: countries higher percentage population death toll COVID US. US reached herd immunity 0.15% population fatality rate, countries like Belgium Slovenia achieved several months ago, yet still recording new cases restrictions. also find many experts, including CDC, FDA, scientists worked vaccines much idea. I'm saying something much consider, especially since better data coming out, certainly settled guys argue way. good news? Nothing grocery workers, really aren’t much risk compared groups:

“The United Food Commercial Workers Union, represents 1.3 million workers grocery retail, reports 116 grocery store workers died due virus another 20,000 infections.”

That’s 0.009%, roughly 1 11,000. Yes, correct. fact, historical precedent this: likely ""Russian flu"" outbreak 1890 caused emergence one coronaviruses currently causes common cold.  Nut jobs sub tell take vaccine, concerns valid.

I’m RN covid floor won’t take vaccine. Partly covid virtually chance seriously harming partly because, said, taking vaccine takes away someone needs do.   phase IV trial looks data post-approval. it‘s trial designed collect specific data certain time points. So, regard, trial. scientific evidence dirty piece cloth massive holes sides filter COVID (or virus)? There's definitely momentum this, there's caveats.

How long delay doses keeping protected first dose (how long first dose protection last) without negatively affecting 2nd doses boost immunogenicity. There's growing consensus 42 day mark safe delay to.  90 days riskier.  still probably work out, little bit bigger risk.  

Second, South African variant there, variants seem level escape vaccine immunity, much protection 1 shot provide it?  Pfizer stated SA variant produces 2/3rd less immune system response vaccine (immunogenicity) thinks still high enough response neutralize (in words, previous immonugenicity overkill, think -- thus 1 dose provides protection). Booster/2nd dose usually responsible boosting immunogenicity considerably (I looked Pfizer, know AstraZeneca, upwards 4 times -- response actually greater longer delay -- that's also longer time lower immune response 1 dose then).  So, single dose provide protection variants?  That's something I'd think would need addressed, else risk SA another variant similar escape abilities take shots. local officials inept probably skip another state get vaccinated. we’re going reward bad behavior labeling story “Good News”? rich nations stockpiling, means sitting freezers injected arms, citizens nations would arms.

Fact is, nations ordered need vaccinate entire population, doesn’t mean vials *stockpiled*. still far vaccinating entire population. do, it’s highly likely they’ll cancel remaining orders, donate countries.

As order need, early days anyone knew products viable. hedge bets case products don’t pan out. Case point, really get depressed untill ""all"" support faded away. like everyday hard. I've never depressed despair numbness crushing. could end COVID restrictions also last year. 1st dose 3 weeks ago gave sore arm \~36 hours

After 2nd dose morning, arm less sore 1st. Hoping continues tomorrow I’m convinced people hate lives want things lock forever world collapses seems like it’s since “hope” thing. yea.

I’ve saying years perfect attendance awards irresponsible! I’m really hoping so. got second dose today two people turned away. felt bad. People want vaccine. people immunity means virus spreads slowly less prevalent, chances getting lower. [This says asymptomatic transmission main reason virus spreading. friend ended two appointments mom. said hell might well commit fraud dressed masked resemble 80 yr old mom... disease deadly tested know RNA vaccines there's also problem super cold storage many pharmacies facilities (at least early on, know now.) definitely slowdown week. Lots places basically shutdown places slowed down.

But things cleaned (no later next week), we'll easily catch vaccines. plenty capacity give vaccines. Supply limit. may cost money reach destination. Depending rich cost may worth suppose every doctor created equal. also going health issues last year I've definitely seen mine like 5-6 times year. Maybe long, public health messaging difficult. Given vaccine acceptance rising I'd say they're pretty decent job might right though different masks actually experts directly saying don’t work.

Yeah, really shameful response considering evidence contrary abundantly clear. messaging say masks may helpful create cloth masks short run PPE shortages filled. Multiple countries same. feeling they're gonna come month say people vaccinated need come back get vaccinated variant gonna ever long cycle. America largest outbreak world right makes sense vaccinate first. Moon Shot, speak. LITERALLY STOCKPILING, LEAST YET. see Pzifer becoming dominant since many healthcare facilities pharmacies lack ability keep cold enough extended periods. think Moderna pull leader long run. second reasons! Reading comments, yes trolls deleted understand, warms heart shared experience believing COVID real getting vaccinated get us this. seems gaslighting obvious attempts fill Americans despair beginning give realize get together. possible USA moving towards getting sh** together voices believe science compassion drowning incessant attacks stuck behind month ago? hope so. Bless you. Death counting educating. today CDC announced covid spread food/food packaging. Also, masking techniques, use use them. hang people? hang vaccinated people? mask/no mask? meet someone, what's best way it? go Mass lent? 


there lots relevant questions usually hidden behind ""cov kills, stay home"".

That helps one. really interesting. Thanks posting! Wow thats kind surge support study suggests asymptomatic individuals quarter viral load compared unvaccinated group. significantly lowers likelihood. ""small two person pharmacy"" ""ourselves"" confused. ""Ourselves"" includes ""lotsa volunteers"" :) disabled killed Covid like much choice anuways... yea, there's probs real reason continue stuff like June, case counts, despite irrationality, probably dictate half assed restrictions. STOP TRUTH WAAAH Somehow, managed acquire first doses already. said anything long run? assume they'll stop going zero covid people vaccinated, since massive outbreaks issue anymore. TL;DR: lockdowns worked currently high rates infection among young people. One small correction here, Pfizer global HQ NYC. believe Portage plant largest North America, though able confirm since google results company largest production site..  get Canada can't get enough vaccines. they're going manufacturer's recommendations trials took months. know works stick that. Otherwise horrible pandemic may never end. Messing doses may potentially [reduce effectiveness, like let flight attendants jump vaccine line? Hair dressers? ppl equal exposure. course not, bc refused go back wouldn’t job. point, want start hitting targets like 4M day, we’re going remove restrictions. 

It made sense start healthcare/elderly, pretty soon that, need open floodgates maximize throughput. 

Don’t let perfect enemy good. way, that’s bad problem have. sciencey question:
Does Covid affect smell taste, really smell?
I born sense smell, result, can’t really taste things. friend covid currently, experiencing loss smell taste, described loss taste, sounded similar taste eat food every day. Research seems explain covid may decrease smell, found anything decreases taste. possible affects smell, result, people think sense taste affected well? run sentence spelling errors make us look stupid. 

The hosers gloating North border suck justification us act way. hope start getting vaccinations soon position start shipping surplus there. Yay! Chinese need pay Fucking Shit Cry River hate Asians 🖕🖕 call unethical vaccinating people earlier probably saved dozens, hundreds lives. scientific measure backing implication non N95 masks practically useless? you’re saying? It’s hard really gather you’re saying here.  Wash every surface strong bleach relocate either covid safe hotel room tent woods two full weeks.Only two weeks return home, safe then.  No, I'm confident officially pandemic least end year, things definitely look lot normal soon. honest, don’t know anyone really suffering anxiety depression due covid. Early much fear anxiety among people know, included. seems adapted. things miss things friends family miss, think people found ways enjoy time I’m actually grateful free time I’ve gotten partner family (outside time them). Everyone used busy work last summer first time could hang Tuesday afternoon family outside enjoying birds weather. course it’s Florida. Oh surge. Oh wait.  would thought hit 220 doses first days.. Table? coming, friend. looking forward hanging parents would think, district sending us back April 5th finish year hybrid ritual since March. teach kindergarten teach literally school building new weird Covid protocols. back 9 weeks. Two days week. America first seems. Sorry situation. wish best. Vatican City must first country worldwide reached heard immunity. never understood push opening economy essential workers placed last vaccine list. exactly position. US see AZ even getting approval mRNA widely available. feels like let stock pile AZ go somewhere good. Americans going better options next 3 months. people want get it, us line take 95% chance catching COVID. antivaxxers watch nation get vaccine develop autism infertility. where's guy getting numbers from? According article he's random journalist, he's professor medicine Johns Hopkins. Hell yeah! virus gone! Lol  worth us go route. divorced mother makes less income step mother anyways.
Thanks help though I'm novavax trial. got second shot days ago. Probably gonna get US results cases going down. Given Florida’s track record, probably type key city. Absolutely. course hope better outcome best case scenario variants dangerous may seem (or not, depending sources - news changes course every minute it’s hard keep up). Nobody wants situation get worse unfortunately appear dark point. appreciate perspective likely frowned upon sub, it’s good hear every angle. What? Haha cite something regarding masks damaging children? I’m also confused reasoning children still interact adults.  asymptomatic transmission? When? sponge? life happen *to* you? tell politicians enact change bare minimum. 

What do? properly funding quarantine processes? setup quarantine faculties outside major metro areas? making sure quarantine workers safety training equipment? creating queue system ensure Australians return home? objecting international tennis tournaments Australians stranded?

Don't talk options done bare minimum. I'm glad I'm missing winter. snow months isolation would driven crazy. I'm already realizing social skills eroded lot! I'm left come I've lockdown skeptic since April. transcends politics, please try understand that. would rather have, small percentage tax dollars going fund science medical research prevent kinds pandemics, pandemic every 5-10 years results widespread lockdowns?

I actually want government work I'll take first option. I've got feeling I'm going get instead ad campaigns telling use straws. Put eucalyptus oil, light vagina candles, put crystal butt, you’ll good Monday. Low uptake, variants level immune escape taking (inevitable they’ve got fitness vaccine mediated immunity), seasonality, fact transmission won’t entirely stopped vaccine good news variants we’ve catching they’re already spread, cases still continuing drop looks like we’re least clear little longer. Makes things little tougher horrible news. UK 'mostly' using AZ complete lie. publicly available dosing data, actually around 2/3 Pfizer 1/3 AZ. people trying use politics jump line. They're waiting turn like they're supposed to, unlike teachers. certainly discussion had. would like see happen it? think historical value terms news SARS-CoV-2 evolved?

Personally, hope becomes irrelevant place distant memories.

That said, called r/coronavirus may relevant coronaviruses future might find new use. Glad hear improving. seeing people got covid earlier doing. Thanks reply! Covid never going away completely. join flu killing (tens of) thousands annually US.

At point _must_ go back normal despite people still dying covid. Zero covid much myth immortality itself. work hospital, people freaking days shot. care.
Guess got side effects. U.S.A. never consciously tried tamp optimism past year regards virus vaccine roll out.
Now must say truly optimistic gloriously normal summer. Oh injecting disinfectants much better injecting bleach! Wow great point! error bars big case asymptomatic worse still within them. also, many models need least 25% transmission come asymptomatic cases (not including pre-symptomatic), careful get wrong tell everyone go party club 14 days vaccine. Thank Harvard great study. believe we’ve actually used mostly pfizer point. same, day Although UK actually uses both, like confuse ourselves. infections accurately tracked, people make explanation want. Ouch man news biden administration nothing address countries' vaccine distribution plans, given america ponied 4 bn COVAX. america's influence immense. Part answered Researchers saw 85% reduction symptomatic COVID-19 15 28 days given Overall infections, including among asymptomatic patients, reduced 75%.

""Effective"" fairly vague term - reduction death, hospitalisation, serious illness, mild illness infection all.

The rest probably timescale - effectiveness increasing time. Counterpoint: main goal absolutely crater deaths hospitalizations, reach herd immunity threshold vaccination. vaccinating half country plus almost vulnerable plus existing natural immunity absolutely craters deaths hospitalizations (like expect should), see reason can’t go back normal. really jail fraud already population 330 million IFR 0.3%, total possible death count barely cross one million, assuming every man, woman child caught covid.

WHO source 0.3% IFR: Okay thanks asshole much clearer claim clear. 

The restrictions based transmission, period. need write narrative? Yeah teachers gonna work year cities, guarantee it. teachers know never full social life taken back easily. 

I assume we're going see lots solutions like Massachusetts used, buy teacher contracts hire teachers willing work. Right on! I'm country right now, getting feel expectations are. probably right SFO. guess it'll choppy return normal summer/fall/beyond, ""super spreader"" scares thrown in. I'm opposite. despise heat humidity much wish get weeks snow showers. Nothing beautiful seen foot snow covering everything :D time gets approved delivered, Moderna Pfizer enough data conclude vaccines require special freezer need 1 shot (with possibly 2nd booster months later). two days Netherlands reach one million shots given. ramp soon, currently around fourty days in.
Deaths slowly declining infections plateaud 4kish day.
However, worthless government want accept failed theyre threatening wave 4 even longer measures... Nobody actually knows that’s true. know if/when another spike ""people wearing masks"", ""people going bars restaurants"", ""people socializing friends family"". great reason stop shopping Kroger, Fred Meyer, Ralph's, Baker's, Dillon's, Fry's, Smith's, QFC Food 4 Less. makes think cases increase next fall? country vaccinated then. data equals ad revenue! Though strict lockdowns Ontario Canada, dentists remained open. considered essential service - be. lot guidelines place ensure dentists continue work.

Last March, put pause nonessential dental visits period 2 months primarily due lack PPE. Things shifted significantly since given information. liability forms though come every single dental visit. Raising prices automatically give company extra money.

These stores compete stores area. People extremely price conscious groceries go store cheaper prices.

So store may find raise prices make less money it. Yeah, I'm wack That's country president said papaya 'tested' positive. likely not. Could useful international travel sure. would think it’s pointless US unless sports concert arenas want them. COVID fibromyalgia! colleges requiring covid vaccinations students? definitely conditions employment universities, even health-related departments hospitals. late summer/early fall, could easily regionalized immunity, outbreaks &amp; high case counts counties either poor vaccine distribution lots anti-vaxxers. admin Chico State may well predicting area's reputation libertarian/anti-government, they'll still high viral activity. become political issues US UK banned export vaccines, creates imbalance UK US claim vaccines produced territory addition vaccines produced EU. often called whataboutism. Must case-by-case thing.

I day problems. saw old folks store double masking seemed fine. aren’t allowed immigration another country one travel see other, it’s really option disobey. isn’t always driving another house side town next town over. people separated partners long term prevented restrictions can’t disobeyed. Kroger closing 2 Seattle stores, lot them.

These two poorest performing stores, would probably closed anyway long run. new law pushed edge terms unprofitability, closing them.

There's really nothing major importance going here. Thanks. getting feel things. I'm live Boston, visiting family India past month. Things pretty normal - parties, weddings etc. weird head back home pandemic. They're bullying liberal cities order scare less liberal ones. probably slow spread, however, rate asymptomatic individuals spread virus others unvaccianted still estimated high. spread probably level symptomatic spread, mean spread minsicule. look Pfizer's graph, bunch people tested positive right away means must actively infected time vaccination (tested false negative pre-trial screening). reports safety problems them.

Generally speaking, vaccines given after/during infection chance success given symptom onset. Rabies tetanus vaccines always given post-exposure, work faster virus' incubation period. Covid's case, vaccine might help people long incubation periods probably effect people short ones. However, person known positive, visit vaccination center expose people there. already symptoms, vaccine help all.

Current research suggest people already infection probably need second dose, body already experienced two immune responses. vaccine booster change antibody levels. Boston too. I've read, even feels like we'll last ones loosen things up, almost guaranteed San Francisco even behind us. 55 remember correctly (but 3/4 small islands) That's 2 times much. 

2 times 3-4. correct 2-3 times much 

You lie again. Why? 2 times 3 times. small contract signed late double price pure gift Pfizer. bribed somebody Pfizer? double price move head queue? Strange, Stop lying please Israel received Moderna vaccines [on Jan even European, EU Switzerland 

It's true again. Bottling done Spain, Switzerland. Maybe know, Switzerland Europe gets EU send back. stealing vaccines Europe. EU.

I think EU must introduce export ban, investigate shady deal Pfizer-Israel punish sides. case begin personal local company achieve targets. 

For UAE Israel same. immoral, mean low. surprised, popular World nobody wants support you. survive, problem. Maduro Assad survived pretty irrational hate towards Israel 

I disappointed. democracy Near East immoral low... Ok. nice Christmas. Vaccines good! 
With people looking understand efficiency, benefit, efficacy hard metric understand, even worse comparing across studies. 
You right, reduces symptoms 95% one need keep mind 10%? Get symptoms first place. want downer, day, Dr. Fauci saying early 2022 we'll see ""normalcy"" part. Napkin math, US 328million people. 1/3 kids vaccine probably approved late 2021 early 2022. leaves 220 million people vaccinate. approximately 70% population immunity required (and knowing vaccine immunity robust less transient natural infections), need get 229 million total vaccinations (assuming we're factoring natural immunity). also know 60-70% adults willing take vaccine (220 million * 65% = 143 million). leaves US 86 million people short (including kids vaccine-hesitant folks). large marketing pushes overcome vaccine hesitancy 30-35% adults hopefully mostly get vaccines slower period tail end campaign.

Now I'm saying hopeless; hope. life far ""normal"" summer (not acccounting variants). gradual return normality, like Dr. Fauci President Biden said. likely still wear mask crowded situations well 2022. think big stadiums full well next year. think able hang family/friends small groups late summer? Heck ya.

I'm Canadian, look fucked USA right now. Unless get first shots arms, may even get summer :'(

BUT, doom gloom, there's bright light end tunnel hopeful optimistic! want keep expectations check. weird given FL worse NY deaths per 100k July December. kid used eat frozen broccoli popsicle. kids weird, hah. Boston here, I'm expecting we'll last ones loosen things. feel like mentally things feel normal actually talk random strangers (eg. bar party) without masks. socialized close friends past year. Fingers crossed outdoor parties summer weather nice. point immunity flatline begin decline? hope get to! :) Knowing this, would think people would taking virus seriously would stronger public health responses COVID transmission. obviously Americans seem care health (or others). EU vaccine contracts demand vaccines made Europe.

I believe true. contract may stipulate factory Europe worldwide long approved EMA. EMA also approve production batches. mean logically can't telling truth. They're either lying, one telling truth. like whole line people say ""I'm Spartacus"" . 

Not trying cast judgement around trustworthiness specific government, pointing logical impossibility telling truth.  Right, highly educated guesses also resulted statements shining strong light people, hydroxichloriquin works, COVID bad flu. mean people asserting scientific evidence guided decision owes nothing people making bets. checked figures Pharmacist husband. concurred Pfizer vaccine 95% effective 10 days second inoculation. injections Moderna vaccine first Moderna. Trying get appointments live crazy upsetting many. determine current R value? change cases put model? would great give detail data input model.

but still consider free person some.things life super important. like seeing mom regular. Seeing lack nuance responses tells either kid socially inept.

You know else happened result 9/11? Iraq War, PATRIOT Act, ICE. popular time, sharply lost favor public obvious didn’t anything make Islamphobia socially acceptable oil barons even richer. (Don’t even dare fight one semester away BA American History).

Lockdowns masks flew back day cause didn’t know horror stories Italy. never board US. think people would go along government essentially outlawing socialization deluded fuck. sub existed COVID19 discussed earlier Corona viruses. 

Coronaviruses still around even pandemic over. virus decides, politicians. 

Does it? show us passages German constitution give viruses authority make public policy? doesn’t slow spread? I'm same, though think need keep restrictions (things like large venues/stadiums, etc) place vaccine publicly available. (But continually get downvoted oblivion view.) I'm sure OP never eat anything spicy either know causes reflux esophageal dysfunction cancer precursor... paid 40% more

**Lie #1.**

Israel paying double: [The EU paying $14.76 per That's 2 times much. correct 2-3 times much paid late, **much later** EU

**Lie #2.**

[EU signed deal Nov signed deal Nov negotiations obviously happened Israel invest cent BioNTech development.

Vaccine manufactured Pfizer. Deals EU continues send vaccines World.

**Lie #3**, roll.

The EU send **single** vaccine world. Pfizer, commercial American company does, honor Pfizer? Build factory, Israel.

What kind logic that? EU manufactures nearly zero processors. Intel AMD manufacture Asia, Israel US. Imagine companies stopped exclusively shipping Europe wake [global processor That's economy works.

Europe plants, Europe restricted export EU advance much manufacturing would built elsewhere first place.

No, buying vaccines manufacturer stealing. irrational obsession Israel aside. Stop lying mate. I’ve encountered plenty people telling it’s real big deal. One co-workers told weak minded people get covid. big.ideot  asymptomatic transmissions meant individuals next became infected could develop symptoms potentially severe cases. vaccinated likely happen; also certain individuals vaccinated seem even test positive exposed virus. Depending literally take ""everywhere"", #1 #2, I'd go early mid summer. Early mid fall think see #3 mostly back life except big events take lot lead time plan.

Movie halls live performances ""packed"" lot earlier places others. There's also going economic side things comes big institutions. I'm going put early Q1 2022 one might sooner. everyone vaccinated there's need passport though, right?  listened Daily podcast well found frustrating. didn’t like science journalist said best explanation cases decreasing lockdowns, masks, social distancing look Florida’s numbers see also going down. saying health measures don’t play part, really seems like significant factors driving case numbers.  super common Republicans hate teachers.

I guess think job easy even never done themselves. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Healthy people entitled see fiancés even price unknowingly participating chain infection someone ultimately dies of. OP’s wish see fiancé unironically important grandma’s life. ""May"" fear mongering. Wake ""is"" her! snake oil. saying bedridden 6 months covid? agree 3 5 times undercount. also completely agree Gottlieb’s estimates. said 30% right target think true natural immunity.

So made look data:

Let’s take average reported case number 3 weeks ago (1/28): 160000 day. Assume undercounting 3-5 times true number infected per day: 480000 800000 Jan 28. Deaths lag average three weeks infection, deaths infection reported death counted yesterday. currently averaging 2000 deaths day. IFR: 2000/800000=0.25% low range 2000/480000=0.42% high range.

I closer belief undercount Jan 21 free available testing probably closer 3 times, rather 5 times. either position possible.

However, IFR lower due better care, young people getting exposed, vulnerable people protected. Also masking potentially reducing viral load. beginning pandemic, world restriction IFR would higher, much closer 0.7% based studies spring-summer 2020.

At rate, thread started assertion reached herd immunity 70%. reach conclusion author took lowest IFR estimate present moment (so best case scenario) applied death count extended way early 2020, ignoring IFR likely higher then. reached conclusion already 60-70% herd immunity threshold. 

My point half way moment, based natural immunity, line Gottlieb’s statement. still significant. add vaccines, herd immunity soon. Probably within 2 months so. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Covid tests first couldnt leave hotel room fire two weeks. finally together happy be. I’m sorry separated time more. conspiracy theories all, everything backed impartial sources. deluded. really handful accounts spewing nonsense. long term side effects? Sorry should’ve specified meant SARS-CoV-2. Last year first surge peak March, deaths peaking April. May thru June saw big decline. July started summer surge lasted August dipped going September. course, late October saw rapid increase leading dreaded 3rd surge we’re coming of.

I’m basing things saw happen last year. current decline continues almost wonder we’ll end seeing moderate/mini-surge around March time?  much longer ruin decades peoples lives order give 80 year old another 4 months life? 

Where people come strawman arguments? God wish one people that's able substitute hobbies social interaction. Seems like anti-social shut-ins right whole time.  whole thing really illuminated striking contrast material wealth spiritual (not organized religion sense) poverty world. worry starving, killed bear Vikings whatever, heat water pumped home sources unknown, level ""entertainment"" options unimaginable even 20 years ago, wake every morning truly wondering ""what point *this* every day?""  current timing fastest possible timing, necessarily best.

Besides, booster shots required future regardless. New variants crop time require modifications vaccines.

Might well keep many possible hospitals meantime. actual data vaccine manufacturing gotten better think decent fraction posturing Biden administration implementing promise-overdeliver everything. 

I personally think dumb strategy people give think another 10 months this. 

Also mental health stand point. think tangible hope great thing. 

A message ""we make summer mostly normal right things everyone gets vaccine"" better opinion. Oooh yes, therapy more. nothing pandemic anything. Nah. Everything non-essential. Think barbers, restaurants, gyms, smaller stores sell food. Clothing stores. Tens thousands businesses closed 4 months, talking another 3 weeks. Hello! It’s kind late reason can’t dilute concentration excipient (sucrose) must high enough stabilize lipid nanoparticles contain mRNA vaccine. one spreading conspiracy theories India ?

You truly practice preach. Ho ho ho depressed even thouch doubt there's data previous ""coronavirus season"" peaked since physicians test common colds. Flu season US typically peaks February peak early October. third world country, stop overly sensitive words grasp meaning danger. That's mistake then, know got two weeks I've head since announced vaccines last year  people feel way, lockdowns kept happening would continue numbers improving much. opinion shared among people set public health policy. Culture around workplace definitely change, doubt that. public spaces (for example, public transportation, stores, etc) enforcement? seriously doubt exactly said, word word. side note think it’s pretty cool speak English Spanish mandarin Arabic French talk like whole ass world got 2nd shot yesterday afternoon, hopefully soon. Stay strong everyone, love &amp; respect. It’s good thing you’re immunologist then. comments nonsensical, merit discussed. I'm simply looking impact variants high R0 upon required level vaccine effectiveness uptake get R 1.

A variant got around vaccine would reduce value ηvaccine. 

It likely variants emerge next months response selective pressure imposed vaccine. However, that's downstream problem. They’re saying every American wants vaccine opportunity get end July. *July!* March before. April. June (what skip May thing?)

Fauci saying may, *Christmas,* *semblance* something *resembling* normal life. (What way words Dr.)

I’m starting feel frustrated desperate. want vaccine shot bad. want family. I’m returning normal life I’m personally vaccinated. It’s starting feel like us waiting much longer thought get it. got bad feeling may get crappy 70% efficacy vaccine instead sweet life saving mRNA point. seems quite unlikely we're going reliably use dogs covid sniffers. seems like ""hey, that's neat"" type thing, imo.

The quality consumer goods improved compared cost inflation, think doesn’t tend take cost savings rather improvement quality. 

Consumer benefits increasing, fast labor class benefits decreasing, means average Joe, it’s one step forward two steps back think understand point exposure therapy.

1) pandemic killed 2,000,000 people globally actual issue people feel anxiety over, last sentence implies isn't.

2) I'm decrying ""exposure therapy,"" ridicule dismissal. even close thing. Exposure therapy would engaging conversation covid, realistic dangers therein, tell difference actual things concerned fear-based overreaction. equating exposure therapy telling someone ""just calm down.""

The method thread seems use ""dismiss ridicule"" almost exact opposite exposure, person learn anything. point exposure therapy teach brain nothing worry about, teach brain handle worrying things healthy way, asking questions part that.

3) tangentially related, exposure therapy gold standard. gold standard anxiety OCD, every person different, different reactions different treatments. closest thing ""standard"" cognitive behavioral therapy therapy included certainly limited exposure therapy.

My source? severe anxiety OCD I've therapy years since teenager.

And lastly? comment someone says severe anxiety acting like know disorder do, like person replied me. extremely inappropriate. please explain thought racist baseless stereotyping? really common knowledge, seems like throwing judgement around without backing yourself.  People know Walmart sucks still can't afford shop anywhere else. Cheap Chinese brands Amazon new version this. main difference EU CONTRACT DATED EARLIER UK CONTRACT. Lasting immunity reason  Oh read another bullshit reminder. central government state government same. pro Modi outlet place like Jharkhand Rajasthan absolutely incentive speaking state government state Healthcare managed. last reminder, press index ranking drastically influenced justified security lockdown Kashmir. person knowledge India pretends expert writes. knowledge structure government. knowledge Media. Yet wants keep passing judgements place thousands Kms away. Lol. show CCP thinks minions nothing will. care look.  Moderna Pfizer vaccine offer great amount protection first dose, what's point second dose? know provides even better protection, 85% vs 95% percent really necessary we're delaying millions initial vaccines could go completely vulnerable people? Maybe there's another reason second dose besides added immunity, idk is. dog catches COVID loses sense smell... what? People downvote fit narrative masks ultimate solution stopping virus -- and, conversely, BAD people wear masks reason virus spreading (and BAD people generally different belief systems unacceptable).

There truth things lot complicated, honestly masks cog much larger wheel transmission prevention. So, case Florida, relaxed, cares?  said, people wearing mask continue so, anyway, won't. least promising government start exercise restraint. must awful, shudder think last year would like without wife know someone lost three close family members (not Covid), dog, broke engagement long-time girlfriend, soul searching, took advantage cheap flights travel cheap, hustled, got dream job, moved halfway across country, quickly building name industry, happened 2020.

I struggling make headway industry five years now, little success far.

Some people able turn shitty situation something great. Might different mindset, determination, better coping mechanisms, better support structures, know. Look up, scroll, print, NDTV, Wire, janta Ka reporter, etc etc etc. 

All top head. find many look around more. 

Sounds like someone know anything India calls actual Indian deluded agree bullshit. That's like Canada.  surge coming.  hundreds doses maybe coming! it’s due government supporting citizens.... least US. 

The richest country world can’t ensure citizens taken care year staying home control deadly virus? Give break. can't (aside things currently outside control, i.e. places closed), would defeat point vaccinated. variants 100% shown evade vaccine, though? Lipid nanoparticles stable require excipients liquid stabilize it. Otherwise mRNA molecules liquid make cells work.

Dilution vaccine large factor also dilute excipients, vaccine become useless. alright man *shoulder pat* similar warnings put bahrain too. Same, luckily fucking love eating sleeping study, conducted Imperial College London, shown despite discovery emergence various mutations, UK's third lockdown significant impact reducing spread virus.

I summarized article. Thanks link. table REALLY informative.

What really looking side-by-side comparison unvaccinated vs. one shot vs. two shot time serious/hospitalized cases. think might want concerned early immunizations many seriously affected disease. direct evidence yet. Anti-maskers pretending annoyed Fun Police move safe space, people susceptible deadly pandemics want enjoy outdoor concerts. Sorry I'm sure referring won’t let post Facebook links look Spartan pharmacy Pittsburgh always washed hands good hygiene. able see anyone od friends, participate anything social like parties even fucking going cafe top muzzles strapped everyones faces invluding mine life worth living going forever. cardiovascular complications related COVID, pertains exercise. scientific world specificity important honestly people treat dire problem years. people still insist living way long us (including me) done. people claiming every sickness next big pandemic. know people would prefer protection rather 20% higher chance catching sniffles, though. Really seem big deal me. Cause vaccine efficacy 70% mean 70% chance virus 30% severe cases. vaccine still working 30% cases give much milder illness. 
 
This entirely comes media idiots throwing around efficacy numbers without ever explaining actually mean public, understand all.  arguing strawman though. Nobody said poor people can't fit wealthy people can't fat. 

But ""just eat healthier, lot's fresh fruit veggies"" genuinely much easier working time, funds purchase ingredients without sacrificing things, tools store prep food go waste.

Though guess looking history anti-mask lunatic pretty much waste trying intelligent discussion you. Lol, yes. Totally reason try make coherent argument.

That exactly smug arrogance gave Sweden best scientific strategy world. 

Meanwhile Stockholm new cases went 24% week 5-6 28% week 6-7. region currently many Covid 19 patients hospitalised Denmark new cases Denmark Norway combined. 

But self righteous realise deep mess in. 

I guarantee image Sweden ruined beyond repair years come. rest world looking thinking “wtf wrong you”. Except course alt-righters, extreme libertarians oil lobby. bizarre set new friends Sweden. visited family? from? think they’re cautious. It’s important people rush back normal soon get vaccine. Precautions slowly go away. No, quite clear intend open stores reach 35/100k hotels restaurants open 20/100k

Merkel is, mainly finished either way. people decide much. doubt differing opinion China vs India makes us “ignorant world”. whatever....


India much regulations democratic govt less brutal. Chinese communist party oppressive change workers rights many years, effectively maintaining child impoverished labor state, know goal capitalism. 

India dhas WAY less investment infrastructure China king building shit. cannot leapfrog industrialization directly solely tech based economy, even though tech education strong assett. They’ll old fashioned way likely. 

 know? I’m apparently ignorant “about world” Darth_o says so? IIRC, reports showing mRNA vaccines providing stronger immunity natural infection. probably still cautious bit longer. data still early, value erring side caution. 

also keep mind vaccinated people stop wearing masks, non-vaccinated people also stop wearing them, people shitty. people maskless, going back. people find reason disagree CDC turns data wrong people still transmissible. going bars anything else. nobody wants feel like 2nd class citizen, confirmation bias always push people accept data supports desire reject data goes it.

in perfect world, could rapdily change behavior based best evidence/science time. reality humans stupid full bias, err cautious side make sure stupid people ruin everything (any already have) take account evolutionary pressure exerting since then. potential disaster hides.  calling side argument ""vindication"" example cherry picking sources? place. comment linking facebook.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Thank you. I’m sorry lost buddy! appreciate perspective. Look comment replying to. rate new cases already ~70% January peak. 90% April question. Hospitalizations deaths would take longer tend lag behind new cases. one disagrees. point even things, less likely get spread virus outside season. South Dakota? difference much smaller perceived though, especially new longer dosing interval. Australian regulator approved internal analysis indicating 82% efficacy symptomatic COVID, figure far 95% mRNA. efficacy severe disease 100% trials.

Even side effects it’s clear cut. U.K. fact Pfizer BNT requires 10 mins observation due anaphylactic risks whereas AZ-Ox doesn’t requirement regulator found risk lower. It’s mix neither clearly less side effects point, far I’m aware. Every expert field saw said strategy gamble know long term viability single dose - test it. opinion, reality. feigning ignorance? even talking about? yeah makes sense realistically get one that's front turn. really care one is. actually options ill choose single dose one Pfizer hit jackpot, bro. Israeli deal this. got money printing machine. doesn’t matter. rule opinions. Op Ed saying opposite someone Johns Hopkins wouldn’t allowed either.

Opinion pieces aren’t allowed.

Check rules. couldn’t post Op-Ed here. 	“The worst scenario open open quickly close three four five weeks spring coming patios kinds businesses able open back up,” said.

I still following public health guidelines continue limit interactions yada yada yada going use recent lifting stay-at-home order Ontario try get ahead much case things get shut again. businesses (not mine) massive backlogs 3rd wave require limitations operating capacity business need pivot relying businesses services allow adapt. tiring! 800k Pfizer 400k AZ doses applied Mexico, 6,700 reactions Pfizer vaccine 59 AZ's. People need stop looking AZ vaccine, works, much better vaccine all. Could answer vaccine reduces spread? agree. still think worth stories, like one. Better absolutely sure let people die make strong educated guess based huge amount immunology knowledge could saved thousands lives! news least 13 variants Covid circulating China rest world even heard virus significantly blunted variant fears. Likely mutating constantly since then, would plain shitty luck recent mutations, fresh constant terror winter wave, happened far deadly believed Covid capable of. Recall reason we’re aware things “Kent variant” etc UK began looking variants late fall. 

Not saying shouldn’t keep eye things vaccine makers/test makers shouldn’t address variants moving forward. I’m cautiously optimistic emerging variants won’t suddenly deepen disaster beyond capacity vaccinate keep general precautions. We’ll see tho. Yeah, regardless growing season, produce always cheap. Root vegetables always cheap available. Bananas always cheap. like said, frozen produce always cheap available well. think people making excuses wanting eat veggies. Oh see. 85% 92%-93%? must fit, smoking, non drinking, always wear sunscreen bug spray, wear seatbelt helmet, live polluted city, test radon home, generally safest person alive feel free judge Hard feed kid frozen broccoli healthy snack. amount contact people, though, likely contract viruses winter. winter peak always going happen careful enough seasonality going push 1.0. dumped holiday travel top made even worse.

You can't simplify travel. spreading increasing then. Wait world left planet standing on? I'm sure we'll able pretty well next months. India capacity expertise accelerate roll out, like accelerated testing months pandemic. 100% right. visited china couple years back kind shocking see people wearing masks. like, ""what's wrong them?"" 

I learned it. feeling great - protecting others. Pretty smart. 

Hopefully could adopt mentality lose stigma mask wearing. 

Of course could totally beefed US politicization masks they're off. 

I'm pretty darn happy masks stuff over. happy wear stay home kick covid curb either endemic contributor life expectancy .. maybe wipe out. holding breath though. still orgasm “have libido” without testicles. don’t think need produce testosterone either... ikr. thing consistent far numbers immunity 2 weeks second shot. 94% trials 94% [Israel tried real gone away places.

It's funny unable critically think *why* virus always here. definite wave starting late June lasted early August. bad winter wave, still pretty significant. 

I'm cautiously optimistic, variants worry me. Along form disruption vaccine pipeline. yeah gonna double mask till get vaccinated, gonna play game Thank you, exactly kind information looking for. sounds like risks unknown according CDC, advises people play safe that.  However, healthcare provider felt strongly risks? Interesting. wonder other, newer data there.  Isn’t every article expert saying something op-Ed according definition? Long term 0% effective preventing death, however. people sides debate, clear consensus 'right' 'wrong'. Cherry picking sources disingenious. Making decisions imperfect data important skill. 

The delayed second dose strategy probably better. “safe” strategy isn’t really safe all. people likely die result.   blows mind literally vaccinating folks now, finish line sight.

And that's many us skeptical message mainstream media presents, opposite said. Unfortunately, that's guess. enough time study either scenario say that's definitively true either case. possible first last long time, possible even 2 doses, protection could last less year (not likely). Time tell. SA UK variants might right, heading another spike April current UK variant, include re-infections SA variant. Can’t wait hear deadly, flesh eating Antarctic strain next week state in. I’d also advise call federal reps offices helpful sometimes. Depends definition ""mostly gone"". rate new cases already less 1/3 January peak, could get much lower April. hard imagine approaching zero anytime soon, though. Follow rules won’t get Covid. It’s simple easy Remember: roughly ~half cases asymptomatic, even know it. That's including people whose symptoms symptomatically minor assume something along lines food poisoning. Maybe independent Scotland, EU either? Brushing aside would discriminate everyone 65 incredibly cruel. lockdowns restrictions past year almost entirely benefit older generations cost almost entirely put younger generations. vaccines starting roll suggestion want create tiered society older generation go back normal younger people still restricted? people suggesting things realize morally wrong are. I'm pretty sure effectiveness AstraZeneca preventing asymptomatic infections. yeah, probably. strange feeling we're going open end restrictions kids vaccinated. fucking know it. 🥅➡️➡️➡️➡️🥅 true. Fauci held high regard follows science. Key word follows. Leaders need ahead events behind them. Fauci’s opinions time voices look pretty bad. Hindsight 20/20. Nice see optimism. much terrified another year restrictions I've ever corona. one hand see way people going keep going memorial day weekend after, see articles saying Dr. Fauci Biden say maybe Christmas go wtf?! would never voted Biden known going try keep restrictions vaccination. fact people 70 older getting vaccines first make people realize really dangerous younger people. Still understand may want wait get vaccinated. holding taking vacations since figure may well wait warmer anyway. scares hypochondriacs may get way get extended summer. virus showing seasonal patterns we'd see uptick fall/winter they'd tell us ""just wait spring"" spring they'd telling us need wait booster vaccine virus mutations. I'm probably worrying much, year madness now. think really important get back full speed summer. dangerous hyperbole.

Moreover half even question all, statement opinion implied fact.

Feigning innocence win arguments good look. ""get life"" lol

It takes like minute copy paste this, life. big thank well, exceptional post upvote every day, stop stop coming theory spreading cryptically Hubei prior Dec practically ""water wet"" levels hypothesizing. already knew back April/May last year market initial spillover event none really news.

Kind idiotically frustrating though paired news still wanking different animal species market getting looking animal farms Hubei surrounding Wuhan. probably want person zumba classes. made educated guess based broad knowledge immunology. likely right end right. saved lives willing make decision without data. Analysis paralysis kills sometimes. Wrong. low transmission rate.

It takes years teach even basic things.

Until then, we'll lockdown rollercoaster, caused misallocated resources misguided control attempts. Why?

Everyone wants vaccine one then.

How long keep nonsense? wife likely asymptomatic positive year ago (my son sick). reduced scent taste 10 months still finding increasing largely coming back. comes back, reported taste salt intensified seasons everything now. practice however, actually negligible. seasonal flu vaccine usually sits 40% efficacy, 60% actually pretty good things considered.

Covid flu 60% effectiveness symptomatic infections help us achieve herd immunity (because would mean overall effectiveness, including asymptomatics likely 50% minimum need). Yes. Efficacy takes time. It’s like get shot blam you’re protected. 

Your cells build spike proteins, immune system creates antibodies take care it.

But that’s instant. Takes 2+ weeks I'll believe see it. probably asking doctor. everything covid, ailments exist given proper care.

DENVER, Colo. (KKTV) - Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Morrison reportedly submitting COVID-19 variance requests summer end February.

The concert venue reportedly planning big announcement April concert entertainment schedules. Red Rocks adds ‘normal’ summer planning something, including Amphitheatre’s 80th anniversary. least Israeli HCWs study Pfizer calculate that. 83% reduction symptomatic cases days 15-28. Days 1-14 47% thereabouts.

I'm sure cases people calculated wrong number describe, sure studies do? link study are! People Asia wear masks time. mask-wearing see Asia air pollution, disease. realize data researchers article relying new, right?  analyzing data Pfizer's trial, that's posted NEJM December.  brand new analysis.  We've known analysis since December.  Moderna trial analysis pointed first dose upwards 92% efficacy 2nd shot.  Again, new info.

Yes, new results confirmed real world data (such Isreal's study Quebec reporting 80% protection). Isreal though limited limiting factors Pfizer's study, got really 3 weeks data first dose gave large majority people second shot time @21 days.

But seem impression concern efficacy number single dose 3 4 weeks.  That's reason many experts still concerned. sure long protection last.  well 1 dose protect variants ability escape vaccine immunity? Pfizer said South African variant reduces immune response vaccine 2/3rds.  immune response still good enough neutralize it, 2nd dose? 2nd dose responsible significant increase immunogenicity (immune response).

If ask personally, I'm starting side delay argument, least people outside vulnerable.  I'm going kid think matter settled, realize smart experts sides issue, legitimate arguments issue have. want take argument Canadian researchers made, that's fine, agree them. pretend expert opinion.  I’m sorry loss, you’re pounced expressing frustration clinical experience great since clinicals either cancelled severely curtailed due covid! charts Trump admin.... us realize it. scary hell. Train wreck? one leading countries 1.6 million shots day. seeing far train wreck. first requirement set simply time test validate anything else. always theorized could work higher temps, go proven. normal vaccine rollout would tested behind scenes even heard it.

Now they've time test, good see restrictions lifting. data show two doses effective several months least. study single dose shows protection 28 days might consider advocating educational.   That’s AZ-Oxford vaccine, much lower antibody titers compared Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J. Israel data Pfizer vaccine seems show much better protection infection. Almost none vaccines protect 100% different strains virus might immune vaccine. one reasons lockdowns measures getting worse instead loosened (at least Europe). that's lie

""Our data show substantial early reductions SARS-CoV-2 infection symptomatic COVID-19 rates following first vaccine dose admin- istration. Early reductions COVID-19 rates provide support delaying second dose countries facing vaccine shortages scarce resources, allow higher population coverage single dose."" feel literally nothing people watch slow-motion train wreck federal / interstate logistics thing. Slowly. That's semantic question. 

If somebody vaccinated exposed virus, symptoms result immunity, ""get"" virus?

In case, strategic purpose vaccination programmes herd immunity. 

Reducing direct COVID-19 deaths tactical consideration, much COVID-19 direct death rate. 

Overloading NHS delaying cancer diagnosis treatment, lead large number excess deaths. indirect COVID-19 deaths. Far people normal dying home, outcomes heart attacks strokes worse would otherwise case.

Simply reducing direct death rate enough permit relaxation NPIs. need reduce overall burden disease, achieved preventing people becoming ill first place via herd immunity. bet paned out? think so. Making decision scientific evidence different advocating action before. going reach point loses shine. European Union country meaningful sense word, yes, share whatever have; 'no skin nose.

What reply post? United states was/is subject. give credit lucky break. made decision know single dose effective throwing hail mary. article could equally read ""Study Israel shows Pfizer vaccine bloody useless first dose"". Even looks like data 28 days information long level immunity following  participants received second doses mid-fall part. barely 45 days published data ends there. No. I’m pretty sure CDC guidance 14 day quarantine direct exposure someone covid positive. unless start showing symptoms test positive wife doesn’t quarantine. Exposure someone else direct exposure covid 19 positive person doesn’t constitute quarantine 12 symptoms. absolutely nothing spouted corroborated article. confused person. sure still able breathe? surgical mask cloth mask day struggled bit tbh. room hot though. makes wonder many COVID-denying politicians jumped front line. Anyone promising point estimate scientist involved actual studies. Serious people serious contexts report confidence intervals.  Florida year round warm climate prevented huge ‘winter spike’. 

And unless I’m mathing wrong(which totally possible, Sweden’s mortality rate close US. 

US: Deaths 500,000 / Population 328 million = .0015

Sweden: Deaths 12,600 / Population 10 million = .0013 4.6x US, worldwide. Um, original vaccine trials? participants vaccinated last summer continue followed years. Exactly. oppose lockdowns part left-leaning views. lead biggest reduction civil liberties biggest transfer wealth poor rich recent history. Yeah boyfriend worked construction whole time 50 person crew going apartments isn’t even eligible yet. 

I family, though I’m happy got it, able home whole time financial problems chilling making crafts shit. results second dose much better though iirc. mandate two doses ? opportunity offered college. Maybe could try contacting local vaccination site ask could help? exactly it. People going stay get vaccinated, otherwise it? Spacing doses effective vaccines increases likelihood disease mutate render ineffective. essentially giving less effective form immunity ""train"" (one dose), increase probability they'll succeed overcoming vaccine-induced immunity. 

We definitely want happen time soon effective vaccines, important stick timely, two-dose regimen regions uncontrolled spread. also bad happens less effective vaccines, like J&amp;J, said, happen quickly, least would stopgap effective ones. curve diving anything faster Texas’ 

While cases definitely declining, Texas’ sudden sharp decline largely due reporting testing hangups point. I’m nearby Oklahoma daily numbers whack since last week, too. 

Hopefully we’ll get back track next week. Texas might take bit longer. absolutely need both. already seeing mass sites. trial run (in Denver) coors field, successful. people live Denver metro area, likely quicker get mass site. able many site, could shave weeks wait drive site. 

This likely true big cities, know Phoenix Orlando it. US also limited... never assumed anything condition, told inappropriate assume anything others. mine, mine theirs. Apologies came way.

I definitely accept exposure therapy common well researched accepted method, especially OCD, today never heard referred standard, maybe extremely negatively reacted past. Thank sources, definitely read it.

My main point equating ridicule dismissal form exposure therapy, vehemently disagreed with. never said shield people reality, saying ridicule ignore anxieties, rather welcome questions educate them.

To point deaths relation population, something we're going agree on, there's point discussing further. some, excess death tragic depression/anxiety inducing, there's point trying argue side, never work.

I equally concerned economic impact pandemic loss life. think there's nuance whole situation lacking.  loving headlines lately. Keep coming!! too.

We need whole lot luck right lol Tbh sadly quite kids age 16 vaccinated. hopefully sooner expected. Trials already happening kids age 12. There's much testing needed time single thing changed originally passed whatever originally study 30,000 people. Give formula make fast. would think three layer surgical mask going filter better cloth masks. Depends well cloth ones seal around face, well. look like decent cloth masks long fit good you. It’s lot layers wear top surgical, imo, it’s comfortable go it. UK lockdown much faster vaccine rollout. yet recent decline cases clearly slowed.

When UK variant takes mid March US, bad. lockdown. would expect cases dropped like 40k per day time increase hover around level months. gotta actually verify make claim takes time. *knew* safe low temps, speed start vaccinations, submitted temp storing at. they’ve run tests verify it’s safer higher temps, submit data. really want take shortcuts here?

This like “1 dose effective” don’t really know sure. It’s *probably* safe. I'm qualified answer question. normal person entitled voice opinions concerns.

In opinion, complete total global lockdown would 100% work, would thing worked January 2020 so. missed shot nip bud then.

It also opinion true complete total global lockdown stop virus would cause global societal collapse, millions immediate deaths, hundreds millions deaths following years due fallout lockdown.

In light that, targeted, voluntary measures protect truly risk virus would real peach idea implemented. opinion course. either. we're purgatory restrictive measures fearmongering hurting everyone, regardless individual risk covid. know risk Covid now. Restricting rights everyone creating perception vastly overblown risk reality low level risk inconsequential really screwing everybody over, way.

That's way originally planned typing, good release appreciate asking question. could focused protecting vulnerable, imposing minimal restrictions young healthy (who unlikely serious complications covid). think would resulted fewer covid deaths. 

We could also done ""less invasive"" restrictions, like cancelling large events requiring masks high-risk settings, without large-scale business closures lockdowns. Here's scientific study suggests would done much slow spread lockdowns would Good luck. Source? concur this, point thinking ""common sense."" see lot argumentation sort outset: ""there's evidence of..."" \[airborne transmission|fomite transmission|mask effectiveness|etc\]. Suggesting studies mean there's evidence, certainly mean compelling rationale, immunity vaccine endure. clear long endure, almost certainly endure point vaccines stocked, overstocked.

For uncertain point sign another informed consent, one already required first dose anyway, give 'em second shot book. willing, let 'em bring family share wealth. would humane, sensible, patently risk-lowering. Yes, 10 times less severe cases vaccinated population, perhaps total population-wide factor 7 provax country good vaccination quota.

It also looks like could good impact transmission rate. 
Because even seven times lower way much hospitals high transmission rate creates huge epidemic peak.

Now must hold long enough new mutations. 
Therefore, charge, I'd still roll mandatory mass testing now.

Because one must find cases early keep hospital, less infections, less likely vaccine escape becomes. Also, countries, reduction seven year away, even without evasion creating need new vaccines. It’s also questionable wether countries like USA enough people vaccinated, remember kids can’t vaccinated yet, order start get close numbers needed stop spread due antivax movement. Given POV, remind published data support two dose efficacy 28 days expert knowledge. Right..

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* remember reading -70 temp knew would safe interest speeding trials wanting waste anything issued requirement rather testing storage temperatures potentially ruining doses. get virus vaccinated months? explain  Zoonotic diseases spread humans time. Every years, outbreak something somewhere, diseases shockingly high fatality rate. humans continue destroying wild lands carving landscape city blocks, rate cross species infections continued go up. Clearly, ""normal"" working us. need start considering long term impacts decisions trying mitigate risks kinds diseases.

Widespread lockdowns slowly trickly away people get vaccinated, need vigilant. need programs put place monitor wildlife near humans watch viruses disease vectors spread wild. Instead thinking human health, need think whole ecosystem health since interconnected. Imagine scientists come vaccine treat original vectors virus instead us wait infect humans. Maybe could prevented disease ever crossing species humans first place.

I think days pretending zoonotic diseases exist over. Well least sincerely hope days over. something start getting ahead we're going continue pandemics bad. would rather have, small percentage tax dollars going fund science medical research prevent kinds pandemics, pandemic every 5-10 years results widespread lockdowns? word Texas’s vaccine supply? rolling blackouts destroy shots? Also, keep changing amount doses need. went 1 2 bill gates said week may even need 3 doses. need present facts actually KNOW talking about. don’t serious anxiety (only flares occasionally) definitely little nervous despite knowing leading appointment. It’s 2 weeks nothing wrong know personally least like ten people gotten shot including old sick people. Obviously that’s anecdotes data promising. extremely safe vaccine reports see serious adverse reactions exception rule. medical intervention going lead serious adverse reactions small percent alternative risking covid much higher chance causing adverse reactions long term vaccine. tested frozen first time around get approved quicker, testing different storage temperatures doses see else acceptable did,and word advice I’d careful exercise go look tends cause problems ,be safe.   Many European countries ""actual lockdowns"" like describing (such Italy, France, Spain, UK) better terms covid deaths per capita US. It’s found children didn’t before. data suggests things. variant infectious. Previous infections variants still provide protection new infectious variants (at least months) , United States see wave sick kids. I'm definitely quick dismiss news articles variants, encourage too.

If UK variant *that* much better spreading, we'd seeing increase cases UK, elsewhere, no? Fair. didn’t fill pandemic. might fill visiting fans teams closed stadiums want see teams play, that’s it. know selfish asshole qualified ""different belief system."" article based medical professions Union represents members across EU. Hence article focused EU whole specific country. Useless? still, definitely used. lived worked China, would've shocked, totally shocked, China's government come said something effect of, ""COVID-19 originated China due negligence. better."" 

Passing blame onto Australia, Italy, University North Carolina, Spain, state Maryland, etc, lot saving face Chinese interest American politics. Chinese view USA center universe. amount misinformation regarding death rate, lockdowns effectiveness INSANE. saw comment different sub 20 year olds shouldn’t hangout it’s worth risk put intubation tube. think 20 year olds higher chance killed car accident end deathly sick Covid. People 20’s seriously think die get virus. Jesus Christ. 

Also notion states locked hard better unequivocally false it’s even funny. Anyone google search look death rates. way media spun Florida would make think it’s hellscape bodies piling streets. currently middle states. begging friends, even people online... RESEARCH! blindly trust Vox cringey opinion pieces. mean yeah good luck actually getting people come would reckless point, like I'm tryna live Ron DeSantis nightmare. mean able safely responsibly.  Yes different situation. don’t scramble save lives. 

Also - 27 million people worry about. trials considered symptomatic infections. guys testing asymptomatics makes sense infection rates would higher. Also, keep mind could infected 14 days tested, means less week since second dose fully developed Covid antibodies yet.  Exactly, like it’s great older people dying, adult getting sniffles..but kids still going vaccinated summer. logic applies parents go store masks children don’t. forget children breathe well? talking vaccines fully available. I'm guessing move plan case. turns still need restrictions vaccine rollout slower expected, they're prepared. restrictions, variance would moot would able open fully. comments would downvoted /s. Why? things India moment? absolutely idea like now. Yes history using tax benefits incentives battle vaccine deniers Aus. Still small cohort hardcore looney tunes hopefully get near 90% compliance. terms virus itself? very. similar SA variant, vaccines still work well it. 

However, could lead panic makes restrictions last longer. ""Normal"" means 20,000 people maskless basketball game, ""normal"" means decide fly Italy go it. think lot inconsistent messaging people mean normal, reopened whatever, along obvious uncertainty. We're setting hard date ""On August 1, everything over."" We're letting reality drive behavior, high expectations reality going get LOT better pretty soon. ....the point is, states nations lock measures barely (if all) worse nations locking down? point stop something seems like work start following data? Canucks crazy then. freaking way case US. sizeable portion ready drop masks today, 2 states already dropped mandates. little political continue mask wearing. Thanks reply. guess makes sense. guys much better handle things. Yes. Hopefully find fairly soon, care home workers vaccinated early. Hopefully evidence supports change policy politicians implement it.  I’m really worried kid already things make virus worse him. also would like vaccinated people hopefully get end summer maybe schools open. feel better summer 2022. know lot folks hard time I’ve glad family okay this. son even done better academically distance learning. child like that’s school big struggle even general testing, went 2 grade levels reading. anyone living Japan give rundown people feel slow vaccine approval process? UK went gut feeling intuition

Funny. data public, also data multiple vaccines. able draw informed conclusion strong immunity would 12 week gap, despite redditors screaming experience literal vaccine regulator general culture, also problem trope says “science decides.” Science doesn’t dictate public policy virus does. Scientific knowledge inform public policy, judgment call made politicians. Personal anecdote, knowing two weeks post Pfizer (yes, I’ve seen data first dose) today weightless feeling I’ve felt 11 months. think good vaccine data combined people actually able get whenever want help lot want date painful breakup last year 😭. bring virtual dating. 💔 Ofc gamer lol need social programs similar prisoner/military re-entry services exist areas. physical place people go participate various social activities sports, support groups, skillsharing, games, etc. others socially struggled pandemic. 

Especially people already socially isolated pandemic, overwhelming relearn social skills find places meet others.  You’re 100% right Conventions, bars, sports, concerts, capacity limits, mask requirements. That's minimum say things back normal. vaccine free patients US Sometimes can’t get want. Don’t selfish douche bag. ""Because Great Spirit say white man suck dick. That's why."" Yep, that's think news way overblown. Even without J&amp;J getting enough vaccine 2.5-3.0 million doses day soon (next 3-5 weeks). 

Supply stops biggest hurdle point, administration demand bigger issues IMO. Okay great, initial premise people weren’t taking significant precautions summer, you’re backtracking saying won’t tolerate again? better. yes. Totally reason try make coherent really read comment replied to? have, lots times. know make change exactly smug arrogance gave Sweden best scientific strategy world. wanting argue something argued 100 times before, sub, arrogant? anything Sweden whole strategy chosen health agency? I'm sensing form xenophobia based BS stereotype here, might me.

You know Denmark jokes fun right? take Stockholm new cases went 24% week 5-6 28% week 6-7. region currently many Covid 19 patients hospitalised Denmark new cases Denmark Norway combined. We're like shit, somehow news self righteous realise deep mess in. me, Swedes, pandemic strategists? I've critical strategists handling situation (so case incorrect), certainly hint self righteousness there, imo (in case correct). people, like every single country planet, act based told and/or forced do. case Sweden, people evidently told and/or forced enough keep pandemic relative bay (so case would incorrect). Though obviously observed factors play guarantee image Sweden ruined beyond repair years come. rest world looking thinking “wtf wrong that's overstatement year. personally seen little anyone seemingly sane. people correctly identifying misstep government appointed strategists.

I hate US Trump administration. hate Americans Trump Administration. hate Trump Administration itself.

It also helps we're far alone comes handling pandemic course alt-righters, extreme libertarians oil lobby. bizarre set new friends really friendship one-sided? know know, groups exactly popular here. # lot people opposed acknowledging bias media insist reality simply favor biases. must weird inside firm, repetitive echo chamber consider views majority peers completely invalid unreasonable. AZ many issues. time ready approval, US enough doses vaccinate entire country. won’t issuing anymore emergency approvals. Fun fact: modena vaccine created two days work, weekend genome released. rest testing. First, don’t know saw 20% world population killed Spanish flu. Best estimates 50 70 million deaths, maybe ~4.5% world population worst case scenario. Estimates Spanish flu’s IFR 0.7%, comparable COVID-19. 

people stopped spitting public Spanish flu. reason think NPIs won’t persist one. think really really good summer 2022. I’m going go ahead skip one. Reddit loves DoorDash lol Long Beach resident here. haven’t heard anything this. would surprised, all, saw lot states draft legislation banning future lockdowns similar public health measures next years. debate usefulness American pandemic response go rest lives, much absolutely guaranteed. Everyone know hates this, nowhere europe seems opposition parties seriously opposing one politically relevant pushing back follow this, people remain asymptomatic much lower viral loads people develop symptoms. Among people develop symptoms, viral load peaks right around time symptoms appear. means person CONTAGIOUS right around time start develop symptoms, know quarantine themselves. viral loads developing symptoms MUCH higher truly asymptomatic person's. nothing rug rats infecting bringing virus home Mom Dad. Even people don’t want it, measures must taken ensure spread stops. already places lol.

Almost 100% chance get vaccine want one end summer. Chances good it'll early summer maybe even spring Deaths already slowing, they've slowing now, news tell that.

The vaccine supposed cue open back talking walking back goalposts.

I think going fly, time summer hits gotten vaccinated (hopefully I'll among them) going want go back normal blame them. Well, personally might celebrate “pandemic day” March 13th, since feel like important date me. 

I think it’ll take really long time pandemic declared “over” across entire globe. keep envisioning future Wikipedia article titled “COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2024)” something along lines. seems fully prepared make sacrifice. like worry political consequences, anyway  Sadly, retirement homes seeing infection rates someone gets infected

Seriously? honestly thought better now. Probably gonna wear one mandated cold crowded place. Makes sense prioritize seniors, highest senior citizen rate country teach 'em! *rolls eyes* Cases gone massively UK 50k+ less 15k day. worst hopefully good(with vaccines now). Testing alot higher last may probably whg cases still hovering 10k day. think odds able gather 20-30 people summer, maskless, US? think great recession great depression. comparable Hong Kong Flu, complete summer protests somewhat similar Woodstock, hell politicians went far call certain components summer love. biggest difference time government imposed lot restrictions name public health, whose usefulness debated rest lives. Many people file bankruptcy, point she’s forced open case, mod remove Edited Title rule. 

Whilst article great news, disagree misrepresenting content article. Repost comment explaining good news. Instead edited title ok relay good news 🙊 actually thought wasn’t bad experience. Sure far best stadium watch game, perfectly comfortable cheap. month? That's time now. can't see us going malls, doctors offices, transit gyms etc. without masks tbh. Even 80% population vaccinated, disease still exist, people still (mildly) effected. culture around mask wearing changed lot, really asking much people wear masks they're small amounts time. might make exceptions vaccinated employees, perhaps?
And think anything beyond year probably mandated, courtesy.
I'm speaking Canadian context btw. expected vaccinate everyone fall. 

I expect carrying mask while. lol huge failure ruined school lunches. highschool people stopped buying lunch causing money loss instead got lunch pass leave school go next door gas station food venue spread = variants. basic epidemiological principle. goal always low prevalence. can't say know reasoning specifically, imagine benefits finding exact origin disease maybe preventative measures taken future, least scientists know keep eye case something arises again.

I can't imagine it'd good progress science throw hands air say ""welp guesses, let's bother trying look it."" Researchers pursue lesser causes time. Yes everyone casual conversation calls Pfizer, even really called Biontech instead. True that, pushback newly declared goal 35 incidence came nowhere. Biggest, blatant shift goalposts far everyone went it. little doubt get wants regard, stores anything else opening second dose mostly vaccine efficacity stay longer body (exemple maybe 1 year) instead knows maybe 6-8 months receive 1 dose vaccine (this hypothetical) time Biden starts talking realistic accountable terms, too. mean vaccines never approved US. US waiting US trial AZ conclude. Similar issue Novavax results gave UK trial see people hospital time choose lose foot rather stop drinking pop. dont really Covid here. 

We take time. ramping production now, everyone vaccinated spring. Go restaurants (I used to, since stopped) see friends/family person without masks distancing (provided they're also vaccinated) big ones. enough us vaccinated, real party. She’s delusional point basically ever one is. Every couple days one would leave new one would take place. ER yesterday get chest X-ray make sure don’t pneumonia. one constant coughing. 13 days coughing point. fevers. thought finally clear. Didn’t one yesterday, didn’t one today, hour ago. I’m burning face chills body. virtual visit doctor today prescribed steroids inhaler hopefully helps. never sick long. “not ending till December” thing Biden quote taken way context. Social pressure end going increase spring, hang there. feel like Toronto must running. efficacity 3 months later tho? worries, least seems like misrepresentation article works one way another. Thanks probably best take day work getting vaccinated. healthcare workers probably better stagger vaccines amongst bunch calling sick.  “The vaccine beat this” heard riiiiight point vaccine released. then: Variants! could still transmit even vaccine! Keep masking distancing! Etc., etc.

I agree you, messaging dismal. vaccine end game, period. nothing beyond that. got Shingles 2017 Italy fuck suck. 32 time too. low key love name Moderna. ode rna. mRNA. It’s clever. 

But yeah, they’re pretty much identical. Folks get whichever one available first. vaccines we’ve seen worked well severe disease, really important part. Last time checked wanted lockdown extension til 15 th march openings got lockdown til 7th schools opening next week barbers next week after. There's gang 30 younger teens roam neighborhood riding bikes, skateboarding, goofing around. stay dumpster behind apartment like 1am. They've caused ruckus, one stole booze liquor store almost vandalized barbershop across street heard barber told liquor store owner. called cops even though they're acting like hooligans. place be. Hold get numbers, exposing people Covid sending wild tracking catches it?  People need realise quicker get vaccinated sooner pandemic shitshow ends. picky choost wirh whicg vaccine get delaying pandemic abundance supply shitload people get course scientists proven wrong learn more, justify ignoring scientific advice test enough beginning treatments got better gone pandemic.  scientific world science like logic process.. perhaps read more. data found  context state vs federal also crucial. Per article, tribes went state-run programs getting vaccine nearly quickly went IHS. I've got doses AZ/Covishield vaccine barely side effects time. Maybe bit malaise could psychological. one know who's taken covishield vaccine major side effects People need wear masks households. 'lucky' guess, decision made multiple experts field. even risk, UK's ordered enough vaccine doses innoculate populations multiple times over. increased time doses reduced efficacy could innoculate people autumn. 1918 influenza left planet short 50 million people—several times many killed gruesome war—gave way Roaring ’20s, Americans danced flouted Prohibition, hearing notes weren’t played.
The 1918 influenza pandemic also result massive overstepping government authority, helped lot.
I'm excited life back summer. I'm absolutely furious ""lock there's vaccine"" crowd won. I'm worried policies may still implemented vaccine passports COVID testing attend gatherings. I'm living fear next pandemic could around corner, lockdowns go history books success story new default strategy pandemics.
Summer 2021 probably great. summer 2022 2023 turns another year indefinite curve-flattening, buying house Sioux Falls. true.  Depends think 'truth' then. Let's say COVID-19. US claims originated China, China claims one cannot rule possibilities. probably true, given lack information make final determination, side's comments scale 'truthiness.' Logically argument could aspect truth. Oh dear, nonsense even...ahem...infected sub. state may find raised minimum wages stores may leave  We've actually practicing full contact soccer since June apparent time that's long proper protocols place there's reason pull off. Indoor basketball tougher proposition I'm fully confident bball season next winter issue. - Lack lag times: initial surge cases missed testing

- Lower expected death rates: different age cohorts infections improved treatments delete '' BioNtech ''? vaccine developed Pfizer, simply supported distribution well clinical testing. King Soopers City Market also Kroger. could start paying nurses better! kids also! put teachers danger every single child vaccinated. anything else reckless unsafe everyone Yes I’ve 12 months Thank you! ❤️❤️ Utter nonsense. Wait thought died MEV-1 definitely living reality. taken EVERY precaution this. straight wrong I'm sorry live like this. end June! UK science advisors said would do? Same.. sigh..When’s new date!? bleeds leads... get ad rev clicks seem always bury articles Pfizer Moderna vaccines work strains. People likely read first bit get clicks.  sure judging high quality okay.  Germany, we're literally never going get lockdown ""goals"" outrageous. Even case sniffles, still new case, there's risk ""Everyone's vaccinated still new cases, we'll locking next 18 months get everyone booster.""  think there's heightened awareness public health regarding respiratory transmission, we're going back even Covid magically disappeared next hour. since happened, we've also got absurdly infectious endemic flu-like virus circulating now. changes things. 

as edit, explain elsewhere thread. Note: *drop* life expectancy - *biggest* drop life expectancy Black? cases spread 12 people? That's important question. Wouldn’t lockdowns make little sense now, since vaccine available? keep infection rates somewhat controlled light contagious variants, reduce transmission much possible people get vaccinated [No clarify mean 'gambling people's lives? surely gambling either way. followed Pfizer guidance would almost certainly virus circulating longer. Would also gambling, given precarious situation UK in?

It's well good say anything science unless data backs course generally speaking true. ignores fact public health crisis needs mitigating immediately. US, graph new cases per day 3 peaks, April, July January approximately 35k, 70k, 280k respectively.

The graph fatalities also 3 peaks times, 2700, 1800 4300.

Two things wonder about.

First, peaks time. 2-4 week longer delay case fatality, would think peaks death chart would 2-4 weeks later, aren't.

Second, increases fatalities nowhere close increase cases. 35k 70k cases +100%, 2700 1800 fatalities -67%. 70k 280k cases +400% 1800 4300 fatalities +240%.

Previously mentioned people told deaths would keep increasing cases started falling. However trend pretty clear.

Any explanations so? r/thanksimcured unfortunately, nation divided life &amp; prosperity really mean, whether &amp; every citizen deserves it. 47% country believe public health right, everyone, regardless income, race social standing, deserves thrive free disease. Many feel personal health literally ""trumps"" public health, competitive capitalist system reward fittest &amp; wealthiest. Public health needs look inward start premise lives worth saving... huge swath country longer believe this. Good hear. Glad signs things getting better end. I’m Alabama. We’ve sporting events limited capacity, masks requirements, distancing. far, we’ve able get football basketball season little problems. makes weird season, it’s good sense normalcy.   Honestly feel mentally broken 2020 Gwyneth suck dick article writes Europe country. 

In countries Europe health professionals expressed concern regarding AstraZeneca vaccine? think early summer we'll start going back normal definitely end year exceptions. job involves travel Japan Korea. COVID could book flight barely notice. probably going 2022 book flight without worrying vaccine paperwork. 🥰 Thank you. feel like I’ve lost entire year life waiting world normal again

You have. have. many people have. enough make suicidal days. no, even necessarily expect lockdown, style UK europe currently it, expect restrictions winter 2021-2022 1 km epicenter Wuhan CDC, BSL-2 research institute.

Every health organization says outdoor gatherings better indoors good ventilation important, basically avoid spaces aerosols linger around. 

My mum teacher Germany open windows every 20 minutes 5 minutes schools still open, matter cold was. Based told me, lot students (~16-20 years old) pretty much don’t follow restrictions behind closed doors. drink water bottles soda cans class, smoke cigarettes together breaks, meet friends school smoke hookah, things told me. made really realize look outside personal bubble understand whole covid situation better. remember beginning experts said expect 60-70% world's population contract virus lockdown make sure everyone end sick blow hospitals.

It's understand large swathes Europe doubling lockdowns cases fall. great info, one seems addressing big gorilla room kids. Even NYT morning COVID Children article, really give much go on. Kids vaccinated summer. So, what, everything opens adults-only, kids stay home? suggesting unvaccinated kids might able get planes, ok fine, drive places, manage this? care still wearing masks. fine that, would like info plan keep sheltering place everyone else partying like 2018. believe that's true all. Specially seeing less 1% took second dose. UK started Pfizer small capacity.

Also, UK ordered 100 million doses AZ vaccine, produced UK. ordered 40 million Pfizer vaccine, produced Trust science bro Moderna. sucks unable get second dose fever kept coming back, even isolation order ended didn’t want leave house.

As Africa, much complicated, data think easily imagine real deaths least double, even advanced countries South Africa Tanzania. problem Egypt (dictatorship, 100 million inhabitants), number deaths probably 6/7 times higher reported... see different ""ruin futures millions young middle aged people"" right? Yes lockdowns negatively affected many businesses economically, especially hospitality / food service. household lost income one us works industry. future ruined. self-hating Americans going help spread it. think worth considering virus understated many points leadership, lately pointed form look country graphs related mortality near bottom, nothing else. Global undercount running around 1.6 times reported. Virtually every primary infected country much higher initial peak across Mar/Apr, descending 'feel good, got this' territory summer, early fall. second, far serious, spike swamped late fall positives current context, vaccines getting around, crushed regular flu, however underlying considerations changed. vast majority virally naive population experienced infection yet higher transmission variants could easily push circumstance cause concern. different 'an agenda', fear, police state choose see way. hit herd immunity, know going happen, kids 25% population. Combine stats already know (60% nursing home employees refuse, 1/3 military refuse, cops firefighters refuse) number parents anti-vaxxers Fauci’s 80-90% number never happen.

There point OP. subreddit went thinking covid would end world, joining r/lockdownscepticism ever since event month ago. There’s never gonna set date. It’ll gradual people already returned normal get vaccinated. California? mean parties Beware Ides March... Jk think ironic happily expect stabbed March 15th point is, comments point there's evidence prevents transmission get deleted that's left comment declaring concept anti science lead people believe risk post vaccination.

PS: say said that? urban NE

lol urban New England urban Nebraska? Sorry I'm laughing imagining someone Omaha talk hicks road. feeling safe, keeping virus controlled less people die get forced lockdowns. 90% people comply there's small 10% fuckers like ruin everything. Anti mask anti vax anti science weirdos Honestly BS, needs sort licensing standards journalism related science politics important shit. absolute BS google find like 100 different fucking numbers, infuriating. American here, completely fine 1 dose. Actually feel kinda better getting one. subreddit last month went doom-mongering ignoring every article said covid may still problem. effectively means every 10 infected covid patients infect 6 others, overall number cases decline Victory music festival biggest concern whether dog knows I'm high vaccine contain live virus (pregnant women routinely given vaccines without live viruses, like flu Tdap), mRNA vaccine cross nucleus, cannot change genetic material, dissolves body quickly unlikely even passes placenta. Pregnant women currently getting vaccinated,and many prioritized right risk severe Covid--Fauci says far 20,000 known pregnant women vaccinated US, none shown red flags. Animal studies far show negative effect mouse embryos babies.

I understand pregnant women might hesitate, pregnant woman scheduled get vaccine, I'm frustrated total lack science belief. majority scientific organizations (like CDC ACOG) recommend allowing pregnant women vaccinated. There's literally reason think negative effects, women excluded studies, we're treated like need prepare imaginary scenarios ifs. know long term effects pregnant women using cell phones, yet one tells extra cautious. based anti-vaxx sentiment, evidence. Can't wait see subreddit summer normal. think many, going need lot mental work need done really able “live up.” 

Agree. things returned normal today itself, feel mentally prepared things used pre March 2020. Eh. People criticize lot, it’s tough job alright. really look people accuse lying about, it’s much less bad claim. fuck mask thing, one would got 100% right uncertain year. I’d also add clearly works really hard right intentions. Read carefully. Large gatherings, maskless. thread started kind thing. problem sample size unpredictable variability within it. Breaking groups limits precision reported. 

This really common kind data comes scientific study gets filtered media. starts statistical distribution confidence intervals gets translated single number. 

TBH haven’t looked recent vaccine studies, initial ones showing vaccines 90% effectiveness getting numbers small number cases vaccinated group. one two people group gotten covid, effectiveness rating would decreased significantly. tell much faith put numbers, vaccine could 60% one study 92% another. Ehh.. article headline kinds poor quality journalism. one passenger fined $10,000 (for presenting false/misleading test) $7,000 (for false declaration health status) passengers fined combined $17,000 (for total $34,000)?

Not mention, right article also failing abide regulations face fine $5,000 per violation.

I'm skeptical -- takes immune system experimentation even finds antibodies bind new antigen. could immediately, even need vaccines we'd produce neutralizing antibodies day we're infected new virus, time cause disease. server guy walking around. 

And whether deserved point, wholly unpleasant experience.  I've dealing anxiety recent health scare, go jogging every day wonders lower anxiety levels. feel coming on, I'll schedule long run day! would think peaks death chart would 2-4 weeks later, aren't.

Peaks bit hard really pinpoint thanks holidays reporting slowdowns, seems peaks 2 weeks apart. I'd say case peaks around dates: Apr 8, Jul 21 Jan 3 death peaks around Apr 21, Aug 8 Jan 15. Well IMO messaging focused modifying behavior rather accuracy. Crediting public health measures good way try influence people comply. doesn’t really appear explain situation well. It’s also motivation downplay role natural/vaccine immunity played. think long run discrepancy leads distrust. Exactly, I'm sure remember moment March, US, thought ""oh crap real starting"" obviously China Italy moments Jan Feb too. 

But really moment slow process. way we' already start process ending vaccine rolling wide scale. still take several months road back full normalcy, predict moment collectively country feel like ""today over"" vs March 12th NBA closing Tom Hanks positive March 13th schools shutting felt like clear starting point US. country ditching second dose. Pretty much everyone agrees 2 doses needed think better delay like UK Quebec Sounds wonderful, enjoy weekend man.

Preach brother.  Thankful ever slowly, comments like starting gain traction. comment like would buried downvotes Fall.  

The rural/urban coastal/flyover divide put blast since near beginning. someone rural California, living urban NE, holes tongue listening friend group literally blame ""uneducated hick"" everything Covid related culpability. parents live Northern California, county hit 100 cases well summer yet Newsome kept much lives lockdown.  going interested research papers prevailing attitudes history 5-10 years  dust settles fear emotional responses wane. bright side *already* shadow pandemic w/r/t mental health, it’s visible therefore combatible. 10 meters, 11 yards, 33 feet - talking miles “Dr. Fisman said optimistic Canada “will awash vaccine supply summer.” then, advice Canadians.

“Folks need take deep breaths get March April,” said. “I think we’re actually OK place.”

Out interest, leaving Canada? moving to? foreign national, right vaccine citizens new country, back queue? given choice better, Pfizer Moderna? decides people allowed specific incidences? inscribed viruses genes? maybe politicians deciding that? Better safe sorry.  Human beings kind shit evaluating risk. Vaccines aren’t totally effective, blah blah blah, danger still there.

But fact is, danger *always* there. definitely people contracted influenza bar died 2019.

And that’s kind risk vaccinated community still taking go back normal. I’m pretty cautious person, I’ll take risk. remember, TAkE J&amp;j vACcInE, what's worst could happen. Anyone germany give guess summer year fully locked Yeah, sounds reasonable. course, someone chance get vaccine refuses God told to, sit home starve, care. Imo message many public health officials continuing distance, mask, etc vaccinated counter productive.

I know many many people hear think ""why take emergency approved vaccine developed tested duress, even get us back normal.""

Im saying they're right, realism/pessimism counter productive vaccine acceptance. Needs way ""this way beat this"" get back normal. realistically chances US switches spread dose regimen (say 3 months rather 3 weeks)? would happen? It’s shitty metaphor people using absolve others responsibility actions. want push lockdowns heavy handed restrictions, go it. better ready take responsibility decisions, good bad. Saying “the virus decides” pretending people agency making decisions. Everyone US wants vaccine one time summer. reason continue mask mandates (or restrictions) past point, unless plan keep place forever. Obesity cost. It’s people live places without grocery stores fast food places. people don’t time cook they’re working two jobs. really isn’t cut dry stop stupid eating sugary foods. wish willpower thing though. Depends WHO. may happen 2022, pandemic global, America Europe already returned normal life, poor nations finish vaccinations mid 2022. literature review 27 studies across 10 high income countries countries demonstrates healthy food Yeah, masks server safe distance away party. sounds like well-deserved scolding.   nonsense ""UK variant"" overblown.

Thanks accelerating rollout, going return time ""I understand frustration"" something hear tech support. really mean counting day get shot also give dats exactly immunity start build up. see day exactly immunity builds awesome plan. glad hear this. That's mean say need vigilant treat sick seriously. Well that's certainly lot interesting opinions unencumbered scientific knowledge. almost like want continue crazy sounds mere weeks away surge supply talking something like 20 million additional first doses

We remain capacity-constrained months, weeks. also consider change policy based incomplete data would influence substantial group people borderline hesitant vaccine feel there's enough time/data. Would make hesitate enough offset 20 million people get weeks earlier? 

If refuse vaccination entirely, problem. logically, accept vaccination shortage second doses delivered promptly again. effect hesitation would reshuffling vaccine priority queue, effect number doses given day. true. cannot somehow treat obesity night even within days. get positive antibody test mean immunity suggest going office meeting friends family frequently. point, health risks depression outweigh health risks covid. vaccine denier, telling truth based facts research. vaccine prevent getting covid, stop spreading it. Honestly hoping likely change soon. We're getting data suggest much vaccines stop transmission. guidance update eventually keep replicating transmission data. Exactly, school year. next school year starts August September. unacceptable. makes sense. would interesting see effective Pfizer different variants. Based I've heard know Pfizer works variants, know exactly effective is. Absolutely. start bonfires backyard throwing little splash grill lighter fluid wood, I'm sure asked fire marshal okay, would horrified. :-P not. actually quite common practice greater China region includes Mainland, Hongkong, Macau Taiwan (and sometimes even SE Asia Singapore).

People like need professional help. That's something know 1 dose 2 doses. eventually going accexpt wearing mask part normal life, many parts world years. know restrictions eased gradually, guys think particular day officially announce Covid longer classified pandemic? imagine PARTIES day. CELEBRATING. That's I'm currently living drink radon tea maybe science wrong Uhh, vaccine shown prevent people getting COVID prevent spreading it.

It's specifically evaluated reducing severity death super big component basically leading cause death. 

But, factual, person correct say mostly reduces symptoms.

Could evidence show prevents infection transmission? Sure. evidence available yet.

I would consider irresponsible dangerous present information suggesting otherwise fact. Nothing obvious get analyze data. point isn’t prohibitive expense all, speaking scientist, pharmaceutical distributors ultra-cold storage, especially proliferation biologics.

Pharmacies (and importantly customers) bought -80s going get money’s worth them. treating us like idiots. bug fixes release ? one reasons continues drag out. wonder many people killed. live Cali social distance wear mask always. go restaurants now. go gym wanted to. hang friends backyard nice weather. go beach every weekend. bars, travel, concerts, sporting events luxuries miss. sure willy get back Cali next year though. like lawyers - ask lawyer ""should this"" they'll find 10 different ways say - zero-risk. ever zero-risk life? I'll take bet lol. Nice weekend Florida...

Friday night bar hop around local brewerys going restaurant. full capacity minimal mask use. 

Saturday big food drink event called localtopia vendors local places. thousands relatively small outdoor space.

After that, attend large indoor party many people know.

Maybe beach Sunday. 

If miss normal life, Florida open. Covid end decide over. Overall infections, including among **asymptomatic** patients, reduced 75%.

I'm glad someone finally starting research this. need know overall effectiveness (symptomatic + asymptomatic) order know vaccine would help us active herd immunity effective vaccine actually is. Wages one thing “rigidity employment” index twice high Indian workers. measure regulation, protections rules regarding hiring firing practices stability/protections. know Indian workers make less work hours LCU levels Indian workers (encompassing govt money services , compensation, subsidies grants, social benefits ) 600% higher Indian workers.  haven’t check nationmaster.com.  compare stats countries.  It’s amazing. 

It’s cut dry wages.  Worker protections, govt action/protections, investment play part. article stated US's case count could 2 even 3 times larger. vaccine roll numbers falling fast here. Yeah I'll uncomfortable among large gatherings long time. saw movie soul scenes thought ""talking distance without wearing facemasks equivalent spitting other, ew"" vaccines get rid Hospitalizations Deaths restrictions still happen . 800 cases miss that? That's nice stuff, parents privileged enough able support online education. work outside home skills able manage white-collar WFH job. good internet home. read even speak English. unable provide tech support. Even pretty fancy private school kids home grandparents speak English can't help seven year old navigate wifi login issues, others off-site learning centers otherwise they'd home alone. Can't put blame parents ""gaming systems"" either. I'm surprised, apparently strong feelings subject, heard that. Looks like got wish post removed. ikr. heard people say that's 52% include first 2 weeks getting shot, idk. I'm sure I'm buying that. I've heard many cases people getting Covid weeks first shot.  aren’t expensive grand scheme things (tens thousands), ultra cold storage useful thing have.

I predict use prophylactic vaccinations future COVID, like rabies. case, imagine Pfizer sending allocations strain-specific vaccines meant last six months, occasional people come contact COVID case come get vaccine develop symptoms. cases, ultra cold storage probably desirable mRNA vaccine.

This also last mRNA vaccine. I’m hopeful practically eradicate influenza tech.

So basically, it’s great get rapid rollout going normal freezers, COVID goes emergency persistent low-level public health threat, -80 freezers extremely useful.  Yeah cos stadium full 'football' fans best ultimate goal (sorry, 'touchdown').

Edit: rounders grownups? sure else ask that. BioNtech vials contain 7.5 doses. give people two 0.5 doses? Like ein arm? many people stuck analysis paralysis

As scientific minded person honestly blows mind. entire thread basically laymen downvoting laymen suggest going basic scientific protocol great idea. complete 180 type thread would gone r/covid19, scientific based sub. far understand science behind phased trials, act based data collected. trial ran particular way, go information better information presents itself. know (would good question scientific sub) would require another set trials conclusive data would considered actionable. way discussed FDA approve vaccines based data collected (trials ran) abroad. words trials ran US.

If UK approach ends successful, that's fantastic. that's typically science operates. part, agree you.

Yes, things return near normalcy everyone wants vaccine one, return normal long point mask mandates, capacity limits / need social distance.

I know people really hate mask mandates / capacity limits, even among vaccinated persons, remain critically important reduce transmission. vaccinated person still get covid (both symptomaticand asymptomatic) , still transmit covid people (even transmission shown fact shown reduced). include one vaccinated person another vaccinated person.

Transmission vessel variants created. Reducing transmission remain critical priority even hospitalizations deaths reduced, least children vaccinated. one likes it, last thing need new variant taking us back square 1 close ending pandemic.

I know, understand, desire go back pre-covid normalcy soon possible, going matter months. Masks, capacity limits, social distancing going us sometime come. 60% effective **symptomatic** Covid, means probably less 50% effective symptomatic+asymptomatic Covid (e.g. AZ 67% effective symptomatic Covid 23% effective asymptomatic Covid, overall probably less 50% effective). order achieve herd immunity vaccine needs 50% effective overall. Risk part life. Even world 100% people, including kids, vaccinated, would still non-zero risk death everyone. like ALWAYS been. need get away hysterical, zero-risk-tolerance mindset. Otherwise forever forced preserve life cost *living*. started even elected. believe said 24 hours maybe like 24 hours don’t take sort anti inflammatory drug Lancet: leaders vaccine science since 1998. Username checks Florida resident...

🥱 1. Anyone who's willing pay still buy right youtube. Taiwan government tried buy Fosun?
2. saying Fosun blocked Taiwan like Youtube blocked China? who's fault is? live? mask social distance places? I’ll retract clarify. 

Of course interacting people causes higher R. certainly increased holidays contributed higher numbers somewhat. 

The **main** cause magnitude case explosion weather. settled science really debatable. obviously you’re completely isolated can’t catch it, even obviously, (for better worse) Americans haven’t isolated. fact, average, *less* isolated Summer (when cases down) bundled inside Winter... explain that? People throwing massive gatherings inside causing ~million case difference? course not. 

The virus survive aerosol much longer cold weather exposed warm humid weather context international travel, Immigration/customs doesn’t care. job prioritize citizens permanent residents ensure virus isn’t imported. don’t care someone high income country access vaccination someone lower income country may not. That’s priority. going store bar obviously issue.  We've got almost years worth comparative data different strategies impact virus within population.

I think fair question impact strategies make forward going decisions based data.

And estimates, least twice many infections cases. banks ... know one likes hear bc finance=evil never closed even retail. team spent stupid amount money - 80 freezer. know I'm happy hear upset killed budget year. unquestionably understate number. 

I think showing plausible range makes sense. believe CDC estimates actual numbers. single bell pepper dollar something fast food dollar menu actually give sensation feeling full. 

Yes beluga caviar costs $1000 can, what's point?

There's kinds ways eat healthy budget. get giant bag frozen broccoli like $3.

Stop blathering nonsense growing produce actually look eat healthy diet. [This ate healthy $20 week guarantee eats you. Viruses don’t ebb flow weather.

Flu Cold Season thing. Yeah, family low priority thing. zoom meeting! That's really solid question. also wonder define ""end"" this. seems like western countries get vaccinated throughout spring summer, largely drive shit ground, imagine COVID spread happen less developed nations vaccine distribution ensured. 

I would assume sub kind slowly dwindle. hearing want extended family vaccinated too. We’re anticipating next requirement children vaccinated. 

Meanwhile cashiers grocery stores front 100s randos everyday 10 months we’re telling people wait WFH teachers thier temper tantrums. US vaccinating million day cases plummeting. political keep restrictions summer fall there.

*Maybe* Summer normal. *Maybe* think even huge reach.  That’s called, echo chamber, good, it’s good opinions challenged, otherwise jerk raw bad news onky good news That's get tested. one sure they're covid symptoms get tested. Masks need go well (as masks). There's damn point everyone vaxxed accept society today, COVID newcomer. Cases always far, far outstripped deaths second wave Quebec. Great see low death/hospitalization numbers, lowest last time single-day death count low Sept. 11 zero new deaths reported 24 hour Hospitalization numbers lowest since Nov. 30 province reported 719. I’m trying find well! Yeah definitely that's really good point. info data methods here: professors talked cautioned overestimating recovered cases make herd immunity seem closer actually is. said, there's work done now. We'll definitely reduce underestimates science solid. Fuck it, I'll take smaller crowds room long *some* people out. actually prefer that. hypochondriacs hide inside forever, care lol Getting N95 masks every person. countries provided masks people.

Encouraging public areas provide adequate outdoor ventilation.

Mandate use HEPA air filters public spaces classrooms.

Encouraging public get healthier reduce comorbidities. fact heard crickets obesity shows lack honesty unwillingness discuss sensitive topics, expense public health.

Also, funding research Vitamin earlier epidemiological data looked promising months pandemic. getting blind studies showing dramatically keeps people ICU.

Then biggest; ignoring science lying people masks effective despite decades scientific research (and common sense) proving effective respiratory diseases. Moderna well. I'm reading something like 90% 14 days first dose. Huge deal. I’d argue that’s probably people wearing cloth masks surgical masks weeks getting bacterial pneumonia.   Huh? Well, sort of: 95% actually means vaccinated people 95% lower risk getting COVID-19 compared control group participants, vaccinated. words, vaccinated people Pfizer clinical trial 20 times less likely control group get COVID-19.  

From: right asymptomatic cases included number people get virus; Pfizer test, 0.4% got Covid-19 (from source): common misunderstanding 95% efficacy means Pfizer clinical trial, 5% vaccinated people got COVID. that's true; actual percentage vaccinated people Pfizer (and Moderna) trials got COVID-19 hundred times less that: 0.04%.  

But general conversation probably distinction without difference. 

Vaccine = good. Unless government horribly bad simply give shit even lives multiple state GOP operative perished one even died Congress Elects also dying. former president use experimental drug survive many close circle also got it. political elite class stupid people represent. Totally expected. Totally great. means zero growth zero decline number cases. one means disease spreading, less one means declining. Thank you!! :) kids fine beach. Outdoor transmission rare.

I think good shot vaccinated August assuming US mom are, would go vacationing beach matter numbers are. agree, Fauci needs accept people aren’t gonna “do right thing” selflessness. 

He needs tailor message audience, expect people get vaccine go right back quarantine life epidemiological standpoint, it’s right thing do. needs incentive get shot.

Instead, they’re using asymptomatic transmission trump card get people accept indefinite public health measures. using mutations excuse lockdowns. october we'll another mutation definitely another lockdown predict everyone get 1 million dollars next week Americans, including Trump, advancing theory started Chinese lab. legit scientists think grounding reality. thing. give raises bonuses higher ups etc. Everyone’s said it’s bullshit essential workers haven’t benefitted economically continue put asses line everyone else stay home, don’t pass cost helping customers. Grocery chains operating record profits nearly year now. Thanks. could find official advice says COVID get vaccine, explanation why. wondering unnecessary vaccine could make ongoing instance (either asymptomatic mild) worse. know publicly available literature addresses would glad learn it. Thanks again. good work. suggestion would attempt account previously infected never CDC confirmed positive: estimates I've seen put number 3-4 times higher actual CDC number, making herd immunity much closer numbers indicate. obviously introducing guess work so, there's already guess work herd immunity number. professors want continue teach home vaccinated, need find online institution teach for. Students shouldn’t subjected online classes Professor Whatever doesn’t feel safe majority university vaccinated. That’s problem. applies teachers teaching age group. nonsense humanity set back millions years bad thing? Yea weird, abrupt shift. Thanks feedback. Data details reference. absolutely want overstate number recovered cases make herd immunity seem closer actually is. went confirmed recoveries state data sources (which likely underestimates) unreasonable. virus decides, politicians. Last summer, countries EU largely open summer, population largely vaccinated July, see viral situation allow continental Europe pretty open, without getting fall surge like last year. ok though people talk say people old/fat/unhealthy/poor immune systems/etc ok died. That’s extreme outlier, though. Everyone knows that. avoid risk, avoid going someone could hit car? Archive what, lol. nothing value here.

I revisit memes lulz while. offense, dude, seeing fiancé isn’t really high list priorities gone year Pretty much this, getting second shot early March… April rolls around it’s game over, I’ll going back living life. really cool, thanks sharing! misinformation? humans set back hundreds, thousands, millions years incredible detriment Covid caused. put measures place, portion population would affected, everyone. done, everyone negatively affected world ground halt, never would happened measures put place. serious? think holiday travel people seeing people haven’t seen year didn’t cause January peak? course did. Viruses don’t ebb flow weather. ebb flow people interacting people. I’m isolated, won’t get coronavirus temperature decreases. : downvoted btw? I'm stating facts,

This sub full people want close eyes, stick fingers ears, pretend COVID magically go away want to. almost like people want live fear. cases spiked down, exception since January 8th. media really reporting terrified variants. Good news doesn’t sell. Nice site. \_greatly\_ understate amount ""naturally acquired immunity"". That's got around 50 million least US. seems bit optimistic. Good story random internet person Thanks!

Been getting lot ""get life"" ""you're clown"" messages lately, kind post keeps encouraged. Misery loves company people allergic ingredients vaccine. discriminated against? saddest part report loss Lakota language speakers. program provide incentavies young learn elders lost. loss small use, native languages around world, sad. preserved, else record peoples lost. Nobody really know's that, theory could present smaller city rural area comming Wuhan. Covid present France November 2019 think good guess origin wasnt november 2019 Wuhan, kind earlier.

In theory (but unlikely) could originate Cambodia (who bats similar corona virus's) introduced Wuhan. I've wondering something. happen (and many subreddits) related virus ends. archived happen April may aggressively optimistic, would realistic expectation ""mostly gone""? (For purposes discussion, let's say means cases, deaths hospitalizations 90%+ peak least two weeks). June? August? October?  
 
Also, probably resurgence sort next winter - question whether would significant increase, blip along normal northern hemisphere flu season. also presupposes significant enough mutation variant renders vaccinations less effective, too. spread LIE

The fact comment receiving upvotes great example terrible coronavirus subreddit become last months. outright pro-COVID point. honest, seeing wasn’t sure good bad news didn’t know size vaccinated population home. found helpful. think Canada end far behind US. US poised massive surplus vaccines late spring/summer. Given Canada's proximity fact population \~15% US', I'd foresee chunk surplus going north, Canada already taken care of. Probably combination people sick restrictions seeing places like Texas Florida almost restrictions middle pack death rate US. Keep mind probably half people COVID either wholly asymptomatic symptoms relatively indistinguishable typical cold. 

Also consider peer group interact with. subsets population much COVID-safe others. 

I guarantee COVID positive rate grocery workers, restaurant workers, meat packers, warehouse workers higher childless office worker WFH since March last year. That’s insane. university (fortunately California) tries this, literally lose mind. That’s beyond unacceptable really hope adjust plans, especially paying students parents speak out.

But refusing pursue coordinated global measures vaccine distribution. get that, however priority still population.  Sadly agree. Usual Suspects open unless forced to. I'm starting worry people gotten used nonsense, may continue comply years. nurses told mom 10 days got second dose Pfizer vaccine. 6th dose needs special needle. Finally...an article coronavirus variants actually makes sense.   not. 

You did. I’m getting awfully tired correcting you, honest. argument understood, ad populum point majority people trouble understanding. 

People upvoting ≠ people critically following argument (actually, hadn’t even stated argument recruting situation point). You’re making false equivalency. race, races tend poorer, leading health problems less access care. faux furs made primarily non-synthetics although use polymers environmental concerns. likely perfect solutions here, lesser evils. me, reduction cruelty animal suffering alone huge gain think pulls fake fur ahead harms caused fur industry. response comments Florida. attitude literally, ignore long enough go away. said it, fact many vaccines produced within certain time frame. pulling numbers ass provide example, produce 5000 vaccines month, increase number vaccines going one location, going decrease number going another.

This one primary reasons there's much put ramping production, less concern. time comes there's plenty doses available everyone dealing limited quantity. limited quantity replenished, still limited quantity. It’s Sadly yes. asked previously define drew line adult child

If know difference child adult even know say clearly lot people sign 17-20, many would label “child”.

Only 17 year old would child. rational person would call legal adult child.

Once again, really need work reading. keep adding shit say, completely misrepresent said.  

I'll try spell clearly you:

1. target children

2. child 18

3. Everyone JROTC started child. Life sucks common people. Hence depression.QED Probably that's regimen tested. one dose régimen never tested approved, many people adopt it.
The Janssen/Johnson vaccine actually tested one dose régimen clinical trials, that's table. Completely agree! doctors, nurses, elderly, go age / risk. way matter whether teachers vs grocery employees get first, vulnerable (ie, 55 year old diabetic teacher would go time 55 year old diabetic grocery store worker).

The 25 30 year old either group would need wait vulnerable.

I realize someone works home might seem easy say, embracing ""Phase Last"" status. kills see professions fighting priority seems like go vulnerability. absolutely insane going insane.

No matter many people US vaccinated, variants still arise places high infection rates low vaccination rates. country's best interests slow spread countries well own. beginning stressed overworked time soak in. annoyed much work many people complained work would sit around day bored (I know many people struggled, also know people anything fine financially, point). many things would love work working long days couldnt. lab work started testing covid scary, even proper PPE besides gloves. mocked us said wanted masks. share face shields. understaffed work weird shifts. told would temporary. still working weird shifts weekends year later. sign this. covid testing winding overstaffed bored. used really fun lab things really changed saw little ""family"" work environment actually cared us. Yes, could go somewhere else, would different?

I got covid able taste smell months. I'm tired time. sick covid. cannot escape covid. finally time things want cannot find motivation anywhere. Covid sucked life me.

There much worse things there, know. really needed let out. Also, please get cure return smell taste? I’m 43 I’m thinking June. It’s reddit, it’s literally entire world. country doesn’t think came China (or said don’t think so) Russia. large expected I'm glad see verified I’m waiting someone invent pipe wrench that’s 35 miles long get sweet wfh train Basically means poorer countries get bunch Novavax I've predicting weeks california cancelled shots weekend due supply issue/storm Thankfully live Florida. one best years ever, pretty much metric. Cure vac numbers efficacy look good. Novavax they're going take longer time get new version ready type vaccine is. huge difference still adjust pretty quickly lots factories produce types still competitive disadvantage. Moderna testing March humans Novavax testing April May Actually it’s pretty good way, especially 1) direct tally covid deaths, spikes happens coincide spikes cause mortality, 2) extensive data previous years showing non-pandemic year looks like.

Are seriously telling look graphic deny spikes all-cause mortality driven COVID-19? spikes acutely coincide spikes COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, deaths. else explain 500k+ excess deaths? due “lockdown externalities” generally, they’d spread entire year wouldn’t correspond tightly three waves COVID-19 experienced US. I'll believe I'm vaccinated. Teachers unions supposed protect teachers, first foremost. want keep members safe, like every union should. Now, everyone knows schools breed germs. shock there, however, theres bizarre narrative Covid cannot spread caught school building. I’m willing say far less cases elementary schools, middle high schools become breeding grounds open school year ends. People get sick includes students. So, 2 cases school, yes, close tracing continue quarantine anyone exposed. Pharmacies best equipped places administer them. administer 100-1000s per year. right waiting state push allocations us. least uber winter forcing people isolate somewhat. Oh man please right. flight booked visit family July I’m going don’t shots then.

I’m also low priority, young-ish, reasonably healthy, able work home indefinitely.  facts? scientific findings says China. Going scientific findings - U.S. China. FACTS. shows substantial difference Pfizer vaccines including Moderna. Pfizer much shot giving sufficient protection South African variant. Even one perfect best group. would guess 70 80% protection. yes normality coming vaccine. believe politicians say vaccine bring normality. talking vaccine like AZ Pfizer whole thing. Good point thought article states (as promising news).. fauci suddenly changed tune August time frame hitting herd immunity May/June time frame access vaccine.

This worded weird actually pushed back April (open season vaccine) May/June J J delays. May/June General population start getting vaccinated.. hit herd thresholds.

Otherwise nice read optimistic article once. refreshing change! would accurate also targeting areas high senior concentration counties. They've running like paid prison semester. get exercise, get people over, get leave room unless getting food going class, get written caught wrong floor building talking another student hallway.

I've got good friend whose sister goes there, told us even mention restrictions would like they'd already paid semester. get charged thousands dollars treated like prisoner. I'm honestly amazed college age students putting this. Lowell campus another friend told things much, much relaxed. School end May areas. year-round school. even know this. Insane country become protecting others, protecting pollution routinely purge comments.
 
Been around reddit 9 years so. Getting rid enforced restrictions magically take everything back normal vaccinations widespread case numbers dropped negligible. Air travel, example, never restricted within US borders still steeply down. People traveling allowed ot. traveling want to. 1 min pretty short time, likely infectious time. would say likely get it, might. would quarantine get tested 4 days exposure. result negative exit quarantine rest easy. heard hard heart herds hurt horde herd immunity. creating arbitrary criteria *impossible* enforce large scale. decides whether 60+ year old work home?

How prove lifestyle (as well intricacies like part lifestyle due choices adjusted) making appointment showing vaccine clinic?

I mean *have* know suggesting actually possible manage. Age, however, good indication well someone manage virus *and* easy thing prove manage.

This hypothetical ""We vaccinate people based exactly much risk exposed to"" based fantasy magic land determining things easy, straight-forward, obvious. I’d cool masks becoming commonplace public transportation even though don’t personally need use public transportation. according CDC guidelines, I'd take extra precautions safe. Fun fact: you’re asshat. Practically zero risk...for yourself. I’m glad give zero shits anyone else situation continues get worse worse. things matter impacts YOU, right? website:
http://dysautonomiainternational.org/ pretend costs associated measures don’t exist? Rice/potatoes mostly empty carbs - cheap filling nutritious. Amongst countries vaccinated most, Brazil currently 7th. know, poor vast third world country, already vaccinated massively rich tiny countries.

Not mention deaths per million, Brazil 22th, behind countries like sweden, switzerland, argentina, portugal, spain, uk, usa, etc.

Would nice EU didnt create new laws control exporting vaccines countries outside EU. Obviously I'm completely off. ""Not spitting public"" hardly comparable never big concert ever again. Yep knew forgot some. whole ""I'm essential"" argument getting old. I'll add banks 500K dead wearing 2 masks? Wow least San Diego, greens &lt; $1 each, reds/yellows \~ $1 each.

Got citation presymptomatic people?  people responsible really held accountable  Unfortunately fun something like day would be, likely going trickle people get vaccinated. someone help me. brief contact someone 2 days started show symptoms tested british variant ( less 1 min maskless). worried?  (in Europe) nearly almost eliminated last summer. possibilities, choices. That's said earlier. said social distancing never stop. Yeah, will. Oh man swollen lymph nodes neck right Christmas sucked. Wasn’t covid since test came back negative. nightmare trying get hold doctor get antibiotics though. Well that's also issue safety. issue safety, wholly agree you, efficacy different discussion. I'm sure equate risk increased mutation partial immunity gambling lives.

Firstly, first dose cuts transmission meaningful way, good reason believe does, spreading first dose decrease rate transmission thereby rate mutation. 

Secondly, almost certainly, lives saved way. virus mutates, mutates, always risk. reason get move give many people protection quickly possible.

I've issue opinion dose gap six weeks, call UK done 'gambling people's lives' slight bit disingenuous IMO. made worse fact say 'most countries this' making point people charge UK medicine. highly qualified professionals ability interpret data far greater I. True seeing anything said mocking condescending UK developed vaccine produced India large quantities $3 dose distribution lower income countries, also given money COVAX program anyone else based population It’s absolutely ridiculous we’re rushing get teachers back school work home instead prioritizing frontline workers risked lives us entire pandemic. what? School ends may. It’s going take least 1-2 months vaccinate teachers teach one month send kids summer vacation? Makes sense. Teachers access August school returns focus next school year prioritize people still risking lives every single day job. I’m sick rushing last couple months school year discernible reason U.S. federal government secured supply... True it’s black white - tons shades grey. suppose ideal world, vulnerable around world would get vaccines first - aren’t many available that! easy answers that’s sure. 

I appreciate comment point view - good points! intereesting, thanks! know, good question. depends immune system still weakened, would think.  government paying vaccines currently distributed US.

You need pay anything provide proof insurance get shot. UK companies saying jab, job, new employees. international travel think required. Eff no. finite number vaccines. Whether goes American arm Ethiopian arm, slow virus. idea American arms somehow second place rest world simply leftists trying drop guilt trip. 

The reason complain US sits stockpile citizens longer ask one. least month 2 time. Hard belive thst people like remain ignorant year this; seriously getting?

There absence evidence. multiple documented cases vaccinated persons getting transmitting covid. understand that? really clear, black white.

It supposed stop getting covid, never has. meant reduce, hopefully prevent, severe covid death. still reduce transmission much possible everyone, including children, vaccinated.

Transmission vessel mutations occur, reach point everyone vaccinated community transmission next non-existent, going be.

Few people know live months? kind oh psychopath you? know people ages die covid right? think singing important someone's life? Please seek help outrageous narcissism.

Here realistic goals:

1.) going perform rest year least. Tough shit.

2.) People going ""mask up"" end year, least. Masks last thing go away.

3.) Businesses events open resume end year, reduced capacity masks mandates. Literally big deal.

Get vaccine, continue exactly now. hard. dad vaccinated, go hug shit him, hang vaccinated friends, wear mask social distance public.

Any questions? could prevented spending much money allow schools reopen safely. Last fall, CDC issued guidance Trump/schools essentially said ""that's hard, let's focus hand washing.""

My BIL's school district mandate masks ""too political."" 

I blame teachers--who particularly well-paid often pour money classrooms--for wanting go back few-to-no precautions.

Schools reopened safely, costs money takes district willing prioritize safety. districts money care teachers. Thanks update glad could help answer yesterday. :)

Yeah, would great (and would definitely help explain inconsistencies). Thanks. publish it’s have. explain shortcomings popular media doesn’t “get” statistics.

I feel like would better published anything instead using insufficient data giving world false hope could end screwing way nightmare. Governments actually making decisions based studies. kicker is, actually agree need back lockdowns. disagree sentiment say over.

It's over, we're changing deal it, propose otherwise denial. surprised United States sees couple days use less million doses next week. I’m Republican people need live lives. It’s gone long enough. Get used kind headline. Getting tested either what's recommended, avoidance completely. wise get one 8-14 days after, keeping person contact list limited test, get positive, warn others. simple considerations become part regular life. EMA/MHRA already approved I'm sure poorer countries still feel safe using Non Alcoholic Fatty liver becoming major health crisis treatment available. BFF suffering right now. grown conversation would around measures need take eliminate Covid. 

No easy choices, path least resistance, attempting find balance. would need get job done. really group vote oppose it. United States Republicans mostly restrictions right now, I've read European countries, major factions seem immediate plans end them, even though there's very, small number hospitalized patients Ireland right now.

I suppose live Ireland guess can't relate, I'd infuriated right now. Even United States I'm starting firmly feel keep restrictions couple months, much cases hospitalizations per capita Ireland. don’t. That’s people saying use preliminary study without placebo controls change entire process making mistake imo. Saying say denial. factually over, matter bad anybody wants be. coming close though, soon, like, within next months, based case counts progressing.

You say done want, say over, factually incorrect. link data? country giving more? it’s shit view. vaccinate risk population level restriction detrimental political theater. don’t want participate things, don’t. continuing restrict people, suggesting continuing restrictions people fucked. zip codes necessarily highest concentration seniors county. entire county high population seniors. Y'all stupid think live normal place lol brain washed taken role. Huh where? Everyone know received show proof insurance. experts scientists say need teachers vaccinated schools reopen.

That advice comes stipulation LOT measures place reduce infections. every school going able live expectations. far know, works (London) Times cleaning services company 5 employees. disinfecting people even get close clean things concerns.

The fact nowhere mentioned phases vaccination mindboggling.

We constantly enclosed spaces maintain restaurants, retail, medical offices, hospitals critical public/business infrastructure.

When comes virus contagious via surface transmission, good luck u fucks. 93% protection 21 days, one shot Pfizer apparently much better many vaccines even booster shots. afraid ""mutated virus"" vaccines, afraid case Pfizer either. Well makes sense though. don’t write down, didn’t happen. That’s all? Like said, cases declining everywhere, even places lockdown. I'm saying vaccines reason why. Wow, another bang job 🤦🏻‍♂️ Yeah sure Considering single person province received second dose, therefore 0 data long term efficacy delayed second dose, premise absurd. parents came home vietnam 3 days borders closed I'm glad. Since brother wife found pregnant, little girl, fell pregnant again. NGL almost shit saw word surge. thus us definitely surge get behind One vaccines, believe AstraZeneca could wrong, actually showed *increased* efficacy increasing time doses. important know 21 28 days doses Pfizer Moderna chosen somewhat arbitrarily trails could completed faster vaccine could approved fasted Lol. sound stupid could follow science make arbitrary rules regarding dosing delays... would help lot. I'm shocked tell you. Shocked. /s Okay - instead get 50% recruits? strawman guy asked (again, instance, talking previously conversation) instead chose ignore? High risk terms what? known afaik there's little prescience SA variant France far.

The point definitely smart thing say leader antivax developed country world. question one could ever answer, might revealing know many millions years life deceased left live. sounds callous, that's really lost. I’d love to. teacher, can’t make happen. I’m state forbids teachers unionizing school board claims measures aren’t necessary. I’m forced go unsafe setting every day, told I’m selfish don’t care kids object. Super fun! headlines variants ""cut antibody protection"" thing decreasing effectiveness vaccine.

It’s exactly thing decreasing effectiveness vaccine. vaccine’s effectiveness measured many cases prevents. vaccine prevents 95 100 infections original strain may prevent 60 100 infections South Africa strain.

Your self righteous showing first almost effective, wait somebody else get first dose? Thus disagree putting teschers seniors. doubt think teshcers priority seniors. Seniors account majority deaths ones end filling hospital beds. anything focusing groups best ti vaccinate reduce hospitlisations. ultimately goes age health conditions profession. Like say teacher underlying health conditions yes vaccinate first since they'll probably end hospital got covid. say 30 year old fairly healthy teacher I'd argue wait abit longer may working people learning far less  Tweets things like government essentially adopting Zero Covid approach. sure legitimate however, PoliticsForAll account.

I'm American lots family Britain. want see them. Present! Normally yes, pressurized instructions specifically say add air vial drawing doses. 

I public health nurse US vaccinating hundreds people per week. use 1mL 1” 23g needle, easily get 6-7 doses. much dead space 3mL 1” 23g needle, lucky get 6 doses out. right supplies makes difference. honestly think days matter even little?  ...put place science evolves new data. research sound clearly another peek needs taken. Someone picks nose grabs door handle. grab door handle rub eye.

Voila Yeah that’s school reopening, that’s pretty bad, teachers vaccinated doesn’t way Haha came thinking yep...

Yuppppp kids school exactly thing run toilet paper think somehow Biden wants drag despite toll ita taking economy (and thus reelection chances)?

Interesting theory It’s complicated. People apparently counted Covid victims heart attack.  kidding me? commenter literally conditioned live fear badly he's literally overly anxious almost everything (his words). good thing deal instead spanish flu bubonic plague god forbid happens, people probably wont able function virus far worse actually excellent point, hope you’re right!! Simple media clicks. Headlines meant catch attention that's make money. Also says could reduce protection definitely does. 
This article: 
""a two- thirds reduction level neutralizing antibodies compared effect common version virus prevalent U.S. trials. established benchmark yet determine level antibodies needed protect virus, unclear whether two-thirds reduction render vaccine ineffective variant....

We don’t know minimum neutralizing number is. don’t cutoff line,” said, adding suspects immune response observed likely significantly needs provide protection.""

In words hard draw real conclusions whether en effect efficiency whether reduction antibodies actually also result significant loss efficacy. Important read whole article headline since misleading. wonder weather going play all. bad across country I've seen delays due weather terms getting vaccines. solid numbers coming Israel larger groups people seem agree - 90% effective 21 days first jab. article says, say anything long term effectiveness increases confidence pushing second jab weeks might reasonable, compared seeing deaths instead. Yeah makes sound like it’s indecent. linked data, unless think Moderna providing fraudulent data.... vaccine 92% effective one dose vaccinate group first. That’s efficient way reduce deaths. impressive! haven’t hit said, hope delays thing past pessimism unwarranted! leaks? Thanks understanding. know I'm overreacting asthma I've taking seriously past year. also good insurance I'm unemployed COVID test runs $100 I'd rather avoid it. seen change tone since subreddit started people initially curious, anxious, supportive see one top comments wanting impose lockdown overly concerned people spite great look geopolitical adversaries shipping vaccines around world. guess J&amp;J get shit together. Looks like guys great last fall. Pretty bad hopefully decline continue. course spring break Saint Patrick's day next month I'm guessing shit blow again. would eating indoors now. People insane.  something I’m concerned coronavirus, honestly. petting WHAT? Please. miss homies. Ironically, anxiety depression barely thing anymore.

I think first months quarantining gave time needed arrive truths conclusions needed. 

Of course that's coming someone who's anxiety depression mostly stemmed personal insecurities comparing others. Rich countries getting priority access vaccines: ""We paid it, deserve it""

Rich people paying priority access vaccines: ""That's fair, bullshit, rich people able jump line, etc."" Imma guess still pretty damn low considering 1 20,000 calculation passing someone live He's gotta buy dinner first. Come on, man. “These comments typical”

LOL, okay. I’m sure first time they’ve ever made comments like this. Well least someone is. Congrats! don’t accept would reduce numbers meaningful way. 

See, that’s interesting you’re changing argument (meaning, said resolve downsizing military). showed earlier stopped recruiting children there’d still 150,000 new recruits every year.

I didn’t bring initially, definitely think false. Think 150k new recruits influenced kids, even didn’t ultimately sign-up later. decease would definitely significant you’re showing here. can’t defend less soldiers already surplus.

Again, literally first time stating view. Unless major theme parks drop mandates. Disney want lose business Universal. like shot 🚀🚀🚀 Still fucking clue point even ok Yeah, that's get hopes places magically returning 2019 normal. 

I guess even Disney magic capable :( What’s source that, bud. sick people pretending anyone age 50 death's door useless society.

That's strawman. never heard anyone say that. 50 elderly means. 

When people usually talk sh\*\* elderly mean 65 up.  would Biden/Harris' rate wear masks. frequently interact multiple people, travel, daily. 1 year start ramping up! (Maybe issues whole time / upgrading infrastructure) Doesn’t help kids parents work might nobody stay home they’re sick.  Close 100% *will*, *won't* mask mandate? OP asking former. source people saying 100M doses now? closest thing could find US buying 100M doses Pfizer. time estimated delivery 70M June. Biden aimed 100M doses first 100 days administration.  market concern guests health long risk.

Gonna lot places businesses keep theater going PR. refuse stop air travel let variants spread world again. Air travel necessary. Eh, sometimes better knowing. always feels like every time someone hook sorts circumstances, always bad news. think win lose. winter burn people staying inside better. Ideally everyone would home June get vaccines prevent death course need economy keep rolling dumb convo, next best thing. probably planning worst hoping best. can't see measures sticking around longer need theme parks. Walking around Florida theme park mask sounds fucking miserable hot gets.

If Universal, Bush Gardens, Sea World pull mandates, Disney start losing business parks forced pull well.

It's game chicken see first.  Alcohol cause organ damage?  would also add restrictions poorly executed conducted. Small businesses decimated, large shopping centers left opened. lockdown created lot issues many people without government trying balance needs people health. infection became widely spread, nothing stop society stopped caring it. see various populists Klaus Landa savior, nobody idea stop death toll honestly, nobody cares anymore. least Czech healthcare system good enough 1.7% people infected, died. Even octogenarian parents survived it. government care people many praise Babis saving 1.1 millions officially infected. delusional want government turn totalitarian guise ""doing health""? #*Florida.* Sounds like it. May awesome immune system last throughout lifetime.  Wearing masks theme park Floridian summer sounds like it’d miserable  Agreed get better can't always like this. Hang rest anxious depressed already you’re saying that’s favor mean terms covid response, better worse, Wheeler anything, follow Governor (we countywise tier system across state). Wheeler already reelected, can't say I'm fan challenger batshit insane. Like everyone keeps forgetting, sub isn’t Americans (well, isn’t supposed be). Lockdowns live much stricter April way since November. Also, essential workers often live people, including risk, associate people including risk elderly part job. Early evidence suggests vaccine probably stops spreading it, follows vaccinating people likely exposed help stop spread. weird real grannies days dress way. dressed like grannies' grannies. 

They sound bright. Orange County... depressed covid. I'm super depressed now. I'm definitely still depressed cancelling wedding eloping case one us died covid least we'd married...but covid stole supposed biggest day life me. already kids. wanted one day us. me. wanted feel pretty, important, wanted big goddamn disco party. 
And covid made feel hateful towards everyone still carrying lives. fair. can't care like care? I'd much happier. government make vaccines, pharmaceutical companies did. know what's best interest? make much money possible.

Also recent studies showing prior covid infection provides similar protection two vaccine doses 94% efficacy. even already covid could explain numbers falling quickly. strictly ""science"" issue. issue people different levels risk tolerance. one pandemic.

For starters, there's pandemic us familiar now, COVID-19 virus going around making everyone sick, sometimes even killing people. 

But there's mental health pandemic. Children can't cope online instruction. College students languishing forcibly quarantined dormitories. Young people missed 30th birthdays, never get back. Adults used well-paying jobs since lost them, languishing street. Aging residents senior homes treated even horribly usually been, descending downward spiral dementia result.

There's also pandemic caused abandonment patients attention care diverted towards COVID-19, *big* one. Elective surgeries, far plastic surgeries, withheld many areas. Thousands heart disease, cancer, patients succumbed neglect. Ordinary folks missing physical, mammographic, dental check-up appointments, either deliberately necessity.

It matter extreme importance people charge policy recognize existence secondary pandemics, lest dangers continued damage outweigh increasingly tempered threat virus itself. root cause, hahahaha. Like said, even deliberate attack US PLA excuse failing massively manage it? though country would take lessons it. Let guess, think Russia China hacked Texas's electrical grid? please don’t play game Imagine kids might infect get vaccinated Unfortunately, no, that's exactly many sheriffs decided do. worst idolize Trump believe laws thee, never me. like 7B. Sure figure even get people normal shots! big deal lol it’s good we’ll data suppose really crappy/unethical they’re outside clinical trial Yeah. Due mutations every year flu scientists guess strain comes out, flu shot 30-50% effective? myth?

Even 50% great think efficacy influenced it. put mask get mail? Thats absurd. Whose checking are?

I agree take mask sit absurd too. call BS, Google crap load N95 pops up. thing read N95 air ventilation good. Yes know good obvious beginning. right, AstraZeneca/Oxford FDA pretty much never aporoves anything without US clinical trial. AZ shaping exception rule bungled things badly.

At point AZ even requested emergency use authorization probably knows going uphill battle last year's embarrassment. told FDA everything fine days suspending clinical trials - pretty big mea culpa. think alot people get mad tons friends family wanna join bars gatherings. think that's alot anger comes in. think people say ""lockdown"" mean friends still mentally locked down. theory.

I friend gets mad rest us group text one joining anything. could less annoying meantime there’s normalcy? annoyance noticeable keeping secret her? she’s giving enough alone time personal space? Maybe it’s something could adjusted told need (you know, whole conversation “when ____ happens, feel ____”).

Why would answer unrelated question? aside, nothing wrong (or loaded) question since one suggested could recruit elsewhere instead here: “They recruitment methods get many soldiers children.”

I even follow logic here. said there's methods already use need list idea?

I never said better ideas. said military already recruits people children. less affluent allies USA depending wealthier countries supply vaccine. long term interest people USA help them. want good friends, need good friends. surprised took Ireland long Cansino,Gamaleya Sinovac vaccines still deliver developing countries, aside Pfizer Astra-Zeneca...

Immunologically, doesn’t make sense quantify individual persons level protection unless measuring indices protection like antibody titres cell activity. You’re either protected whatever end point measured clinical trial..

When vaccine said 80% effective instance, means 8/10 people receive vaccine protected particular endpoint (ie, severe disease death, etc) individual “80% protection” keep seeing people saying discussing vaccines general (not specific thread).

Narrator: cousins decided one way get family's attention actually Pfizer recommending seeking approval Separately, vaccine, authorized U.S., U.K., EU elsewhere, stored transported minus 25 minus 15 degrees Celsius, minus 13 5 degrees Fahrenheit—similar consumer freezer—Pfizer BioNTech said. ... companies said seeking approval U.S. Food Drug Administration change vaccine’s storage rules

That really ought cut people saying ""the government deciding manufacturer recommendations"", got tossed around lot response governments taking first-dose-first strategy. (Even *against* manufacturer recommendations -- could neither recommended manufacturers studied one strategy trials.) common approach seen. 

All primary contact asked quarantine/get tested. contacts unless test positive develop symptoms. surely aware first virus we've encountered right?

It's funny say this. whole ""its new normal! Hurr durr!"" 2020, pretty much saying different context.

How mean ""new normal""? ""new normals"" pandemic far? Spanish Flu? No?

As far know life always returned normal. load bollocks. mean even lockdowns virus spread everywhere really accomplish except ruin futures millions young middle aged people? countries lockdowns actually worked islands like New Zealand, Iceland, Australia etc.. countries like US UK cant control borders different states cities different lockdown rules never going able control virus. mRNA vaccines takes 6 weeks get new variant out. long testing previously necessary going forward, see flu vaccine example.

The two dose regimen fully protect variants anyway.

One dose 20 days gives good enough protection. limits time infected. limits time sick. limits severity disease. limits viral load put out. factors limit spread.

The largest problem lack hospital beds. Wow. really feel anyone situation. Isolation hard enough people love able people love heartbreaking. Sure. makes shit prescriptive statement deal covid. Wouldn’t say world quite limited vaccine supply days... U.S. pledge $4 billion global vaccines. Yes. I’m saying jump around 7 8 thousand people. [here data 10 year Looking wider picture see 2019’s total 88,0000 abnormally low average 90,000 deaths. jump you’re seeing looking back 4 years seems worse is, like spreading misinformation order misleading, fear monger.

If something like tampering official figures occurring, would evidence it. Criminals aren’t stupid. Agree disagree like, look forward slow drip realisation mainstream eventually back everything “conspiracy theorists” screaming decades. old story. 

Look forward seeing round xx article posted days ago mentioned variant completely evade vaccine would need substantial mutation spike protein. would happen though mutation would also make difficult infect cell impossible. Really ingenious solution covid problem, I'm medical field know accurate is. Nope first dose moderna pfizer. Right, can’t ways. Americans love cheap products, businesses love high earnings, everyone bitches China gets manufacturing jobs becomes largest economy world. ourselves, globalization effectively wiped middle class. Also, J&amp;J considered live vaccine biologics example need consult doctors. humira, can't take J&amp;J Moderna Pfizer I'm hoping I'm sooner later. No, distribution administering vaccines much, much less bottleneck production vaccines. Look fast example Israel vaccinating. Every western country able got supplies. 50 magic cut vaccinate teachers age 50? pass vaccination people 50? 

Truth reasonable explanation saying schools open teacher protected ignoring fact parents protected. childrent pass virus easily parents teachers, require parents vaccinated teachers... truth need vaccinate parents teachers opening schools makes sense. get second shot

In seriousness, thought get 1st dose (whether done legitimately not), prioritized get 2nd dose? suppose despite getting 1st shot, barred getting 2nd time? I’ve seen exact #s age, race, title. Doctors highest, followed nurses around 75%. groups still 50-60% shit not, one rationale front line staff like ones clean isolation rooms “we culture makes us suspicious putting foreign things body.” could think still happen breathe get foreign virus could land ICU. Lots ignorance still going around hope news helps change people’s minds. Damn. people getting 5 figure bonuses instead healthcare workers even going get raise year imbalanced revenues. india MVP atm! Cdc garbage pushing political agenda since began, They’ll probably Oscar baits misinformation? several articles last week mentioning possible connection blood disorder. anything printed since contradict that? so, anxiety would love read it. studied 21 day regiment doses storage ultra-cold freezers get study quickly. mean configuration works, means that's thing they've tested affirm true. time passed, they've able tests different dosing regiments freezer temperatures. missing point. Children much risk virus never been. still two groups children come contact with... Teacher parents higher risk group. cannot logically say need make sure teacher vaccinated ignore parents. reason try sell story care risk adult parents. 

If want claim unvaccinated parents risk, really means teacher risk either without vaccination. [No, kooky real Funny sub echo-chamber so-called ""pro vaxxers"" critical opinion shunned ""incivil"". active propaganda lately mods asleep wanting “both sides” pandemic. I've read articles nothing confirmed, someone already anxiety meds, tough see *any* mention issues. OCD overdrive, especially since give time frame ""out woods"" speak. Smart people would see link almost immediately story find study. 

No word pretending there's study though. idea talking about... Even could, seems like slowdown comes distribution? Yes, pure numbers game favor delaying second dose several weeks. 

Domestically, crushing virus quickly swiftly reduces mutation risk most. best way stagger doses reach herd immunity quickly possible. 

The risk comes international realm vaccine rollout slow using less effective vaccines numbers much higher. risk go away regardless US domestically. simply don’t know variants. people vaccinated variety evade much easier time spreading. would welcome. wife teacher got 2nd dose 10th.

I *should* phase 1c (essential lab worker) hoping get mine next month two. causes anxiety knowing when. Precisely. Early struggled easy way communicate exponential impact age Covid. Eventually hit upon: 80 year-olds 100x likely die Covid 40 year-olds, less risk flu. governments flat-out ignored covid response. worse. NJ, NY, PA, others governments actively infected elderly. pretty convinced governments done nothing (except assistance vaccine development) would lower mortality rates. Like...wtf? figuring now? makes doubt...a lot things... Yes. hospitals already booked end April. know else 99% survival rate? Fosun operate Taiwan ability distribute Taiwan. article: 

The U.S. officials said donations would interfere Biden’s promise enough vaccines available Americans want end July.

“When sufficient supply intention consider donating surplus vaccines, absolutely,” said one official. heard immunity summer. definitely heard that. Yeah, conversation over. Tiresome. 100% would rather get COVID that's even question. gloomy one think reflect following fall/winter. sorry, last 2 years turned pessimist :p felt crumby.. per expected. Felt good 36 hrs post shot 👍👍 Riiiight. Everything west reports China “well sourced” aka Adrian Zenz bullshit all. real data early primate studies IgA detected challenges. Also, know, actual scientists. epidemiologists virologists warning strategy, still problem anecdotes lack control group. Somebody takes stimulant medication child *can* develop addiction later life, could also developed addiction they'd never medicated. could even come sooner worse.

That's one look studies form opinion risks benefits given medication, individuals.

By way, extended release versions heavily favoured nowadays typical ""hit"" ""rebound"" effects. Pfizer, speed development time, test multiple temperatures. Moderna did. Also, believe, Pfizer tested multiple dose levels Moderna not. There's thought Moderna's recommended dose lowered match Pfizer's. Additional testing takes time speed prioritized.  slightest.

1. study data 28 days first dose. information long immunity last much protection give future

2. fears strategy could lead immune escape allow variants resistant spread Even year later look back turns right, wrong decision time based information had. Betting house 00 winning vindicate strategy, makes lucky idiot could see two nonsensical, alarmist reasons this, theoretically. One, masks aren’t 100% secondly, everyone wear n95 wear protect them. 

Just playing devils advocate hypothetical situation, here. way vaccine rollout happening backwards. REALLY want protect elderly, vaccinate spread happening, based something like age. Right seems happening (in California least) YOUNG people get virus, bring home elderly, spreads rampant multigenerational housing. SO... really want stop fast possible, need vaccinating group currently not. need vaccinate people working spreading it, ask vulnerable continue stay home. Lazy sitting ass year waiting people sort things you. mean unvaccinated would understand vaccines provide total protection serious disease death, near perfect protection from
Mild disease, significant transmission stopping abilities.  think might missing point though. I'm proposing mandate, quite opposite actually. I'm saying die-hard pro-mask wear double mask protect themselves. want (those said tolerate idea) wear double mask. Heck, even wear single mask. putting risk, seems like win-win personal freedom personal protection. tough question ask online forum median user age 30, know outcomes good. Get little closer 50 (not even geriatric, working age) quite different. initial data Pfizer Moderna showed vaccines strongly effective 14 days first shot. Moderna started trials couple months earlier. Pfizer started Phase May, Moderna started *February* Moderna time run trials don’t really agree could classify US whole locked down. yet get downvoted suggest likely case. People fucking dumb. course know sure 100% tested it. like... Please. Fuck dude, wife telling last year terrified taking daughter outside. Thankfully wasn’t walking could crawl around apartment. Still though.... Pffft, believe science? agree nowhere US actual lockdown now. Oh yeah I'd want buy lighter fabric ones layer surgical masks, ones filters, wonder that's effectively thing single five-layer filtered mask. Probably time getting influenced antagonistic cultures like US to. saying grounds saying US antagonistic part that's exposed influences rest world certainly comes across like times. pointless arguing, grew tired back spring lol wanna know sinopharm vaccine, coz got one. Gimme info friends, help ease pain... not, least en masse. Also allowing virus acquire variations might make much harder problem solve. 

I know fatigued takes simplistic binary. complex issue balance health economy tough, think take makes sense. another hidden agenda things powers be?  Like masks year ago?  ""don't know"" thing like Fomites time frame?  
I trouble seeing helpful. Makes sense. BioNTech small company mRNA vaccines long. AFAIK, NIH (who produced Moderna vaccine) studying since SARS-CoV-1. thoughts late game mandate actually get people follow said mandate. true. but, something else well. mostly access variety news sources. people china, much. so, i, person eu get talk rest unlike counterpart china. Surgical mask cloth mask one things CDC recommending, along folding/looping surgical mask better fit (that really work face though). weird obsession origin lab conspiracies overshadows fact poor governance practices (in China elsewhere) got us now. link seems focused cases, great statistic look since depends heavily much testing done (which varies lot countries). According UK, Italy, Portungal, etc. deaths per capita US, despite strict lockdowns. Spain France similar numbers deaths per capita US. Pretty sure started two doses that's tested. far I'm aware talk 3rd dose mostly relates possible boosters account recently discovered strains, vaccines may less effective against. Rarely ever shocked something New York Times says, absolutely shocked admitting thing. 100% complicit thing along friends Coronavirus News Network, must getting gentle nudging public health officials scare tactics far harm good. 

Maybe tide turning. We’ll see.  stupid? need variance requests? zoning COVID? Yeah guess, understand people must edge year distancing, someone comes aggressive calls grandma killer it. people politely asking questions health intrusive make minority content discussion threads. There's harm helpful polite them. Saved Click. article: drives open anyone 18 years old, contrast surrounding Arizona communities still limiting appointments 65. Aren’t sniffer dogs also sometimes unreliable regular sniffing duties? Like giving false tells signals? Definitely might lockdown back like April, now?

Other California closing indoor outdoor dining, worst restrictions think US like 50% capacity limits indoor dining barring mass gatherings (which sucks, far cry lock down) Weekend Modernie's Moderna could figure out, Pfizer? studies used 2 dose regimen showed efficacy high. Many later came additional findings single dose regimens, generally lower varied one vaccine another. important note studies done smaller populations provided good idea they’d function real world, could prove different fully rolled out.

Now vaccines widely used world better real world data gives us accurate picture different dosing routines perform. One recent analysis using real world data shown Moderna vaccine higher efficacy single dose immunization previously shown trials. great news considered implementing actual policy recommendations. could 100% certain transmit virus, would rather infected. 

But issue, can't sure. surprised back generators hospitals. think prepared flexible. possible regions need re-impose restrictions various reasons (For instance, Australia brief period data suggested might particularly fast-spreading variant).Trying fight we're tired good. Pfizer tries shortcut testing process something goes wrong they'll literally sued existence. frustrating imo kinda understandable. feeling low temp freezers require special power specifications, preparing could require electrical work well. That's never cheap. That's great news! Source that? believe you, want read it. Nothing prevents tiered approach either. example, give single dose every 80+ year old region anything make sure get second dose moving 65+ whatever division country make. mean give single dose whole population giving second doses old people risk groups. Dang, that's really sad. think people become ardent disagreement anti-maskers genuinely want hear compromise. Let guess: 2023 we’re lucky variants don’t emerge. recommendation stagger vaccine injections among staff, need recover another thing learned pandemic, 20-20 hindsight seems blatantly obvious, wasn't.

In US CDC actually made recommendation first vaccine ever authorized. I’m waiting for. don’t go much, comfortable don’t really need to. I’m vaccinated (or 2 weeks after) go shopping nervous. think hard retrain brain though. local news segment local kid yesterday. Still there. always rare. without lockdowns Sweden better US lot lockdowns that's supposed evidence lockdowns work? mean, someone actively **has** flu pharmacy, grocery store, (unfortunately) work - yes, would love specific person wear mask specific period time potentially contagious. 


If they're talking everyone masking *just case* flu season, that's extreme fringe opinion zero belief would ever actually happen. Epicenter outbreak like km lab China studying bat virus. Seems little different. Good job media. took vaccine still keeps hospital made people think it’s worthless. Awesome job. People die variety reasons every day. I'm really sorry guy's grandfather dying, that's really rough, banning things/locking prevent possible dead reason. That's basically insanity. ultra cold freezers storage 6 months. 5 days prior use, OK store standard fridge. 

This proposal adds intermediate 2 week tier between: 6 months ultra-cold freezer, 2 weeks regular freezers, 5 days fridge. 

The ultra-cold freezers still needed, logistics hubs less application sites. downvote speak truth. Interesting. Care share?  Thank you! guess needed fall sword warn others system isn’t designed equitable,” added posting now-deleted tweet. “People right angry.”


Then delete tweet? thread basically become loonies everyday expect it. Yeah seem complicated. one work likes cares anyone else work with. honest Reddit answer ever seen! Bravo! Wtf? completely wrong. Manhattan quite zip codes infection rates lowest country whole time. I’m curious see wins out: desire go concert avoiding scolded masks distancing concert doesn’t sound enjoyable. know first gate going procedure sound turned snd lights turned security guard notices mask somebody’s nose. 

There going time people aren’t scared covid, they’re annoyed fun police. double masking recommendation surprising me. time I’ve ever worn two surgical n95 (to preserve n95 reuse work). 

I mean, get point wearing surgical mask cloth mask - general public, think counterproductive. fit good (otherwise you’re touching adjusting constantly). adds another layer, literally, mandates western world already problem accommodating to, end exhausting year restrictions... which, think, lead people giving altogether. kind double mask mandate point wouldn’t well tolerated, say least. live California work lot Asian people. wear masks work feeling sick. honestly appreciate it! see problem it. feel sick, wear mask stay home. even gotten cold year, nice. certainly agree IgA targeting would great approach target earliest stage viral entry interested see get mucosal targeted vaccines ground (including one developed colleagues). However, would hesitant say IgA necessary neutralization.

The difference would probably generating productive infection. high mucosal IgA levels could potential preventing cell getting infected, vaccine-induced serum IgG could still prevent infection truly taking hold. may cells get infected upper respiratory tract, rapid influx IgG blood serum could prevent infection spreading cells taking hold. far transmission concerned would likely similar impact cells get infected all.

Again remains seen far transmission goes, almost vaccines work generating IgG responses neutralizing even mucosal infections. Though agree targeting mucosal immunity IgA production future vaccines smart move generate similar strong durable responses give credit making educated guess. many people stuck analysis paralysis. thing happened US masks. Early thing US government kept saying there’s evidence masks work. Every often use common sense. least half jobs listed interact many people every day. could even add non-essential workers still required come office. around 25 people day, masks desks, someone sick, I'd much higher viral load some.

Then add underlying conditions, virtually every American adult could considered ""priority."" That's problem. There's priority everyone's priority lol. need keep jabbing quickly possible quit arguing who's important. 

My state opened vaccinations yesterday 65+ earlier demand dropped appointments filled. Jab go, people. FUCK know freezer piece now? tested? kind shit exactly causes 42% America believe trust science. failure.

Everything rushed. tested specific set travel injection times get authorisation. less done this.

Don't forget taken year. Normally takes 5+. Economics still academic field going trust experts economics redditors. Free trade good. also live Florida confirm!

Don't love living Florida, hearing people live Delaware talking bad Floridians keeping guidelines? 99% places go around Orlando would looking like crazy person walked without mask. even includes places like Wawa, Target, etc...not theme parks. Considering future variants issue, come third world countries, HUGE news. One would think lol Many states stay home orders closed non-essential businesses various times. think fair call lockdown, even strictly enforced countries. people get tired pointing out, happening everywhere without rrgard length strength lockdown. Even heavily pro lockdown sources admit due seasonality possibly partial herd immunity would take covid sure. week two feeling shitty plus small risk serious complications much better full year devoid anything makes life worth living.

agreed. unpopular answer to, know, WANT LIVE.  Ah, sorry negative reactions - go someone specializes it? really know ease someone doesn’t shock them. said, think cried every session first 2 months started getting better... it’s tough face anxiety first.

I also vehemently disagree ridicule dismissal exposure therapy - sorry came way. main point reassurance (while nice do) actually ends backfiring. shouldn’t reassuring, also shouldn’t ridiculing. 

Totally agree nuance. totally agree won’t see eye eye excess deaths because, well, we’re wired think differently it. Thanks good conversation! study single data point. Canada UK approach shown sign failure 3 months. might go way talk strangers, merely gaze upon long-forbidden, exposed mouth speaking human.

I doubt happen. think pandemic accelerated growth loneliness social isolation. said thread days ago I've double masking last month got voted. sure people problem it, hard thing do. shopping? Bell peppers 1.69/lb here. There's sale chicken breast.99/lb. Pork loin chops are.99/lb. Broccoli 99/lb cauliflower 99/lb last week. ridiculously cheap make healthy food. Avocados 2/$1. UK outdoor mask wearing isn’t mandated, people it. vastly different mechanisms processes makes work, first set mRNA vaccines used public wide datasets available. entire subfield statistics called Design Experiments focuses small process changes affect outcomes, large chunk people end manufacturing (eg manufacturing vaccines). Making process change sounds great works theoretically doesn’t manifest real world common way companies make product worse expensive time without effective design experiments process. I'm going lie. article made day, 14 days first dose right now. Assuming study supported others, see reason doubt, would happy forego second shot somebody else get first instead. immunocompromised something? seem worried anyone else subreddit. Depends size.

Tuberculosis? agree need far cognizant vigilant comes viruses going forward eventually going accept COVID another illness going live with. That's meters, miles, people metric-challenged. mean rational basis believe single dose vaccine would confer level immunity? really enough everyone wants one End May. 3 months complete safe effective way. BMI also busted system. weigh 130 (from 230 highest) I'm short woman, I'm ""technically"" overweight, even though ski, dance, lift, etc. pretty healthy great cholesterol blood pressure. saw line, probably outraged qualified comorbidity. fuck would assume I'm Conservative? First I'm even US, second I'm actually libertarian (a real one left says libertarian) hence ""fuck lockdowns masks"" attitude.

And debunked, fucking assure I'd agree everything said ""race"" mutation taking ruining progress we've made far. Doubling rate give pfizer keeps us ahead possible mutation might change killed vaccine. studies israel already past 28 days, imagine they'll continue monitor people study 1 shot efficacy. Covid 1000%. I've already it, meant end restrictions I'd happily go again. China shot foot backstabbed Canada refusing send joint venture CanSino vaccine Canada testing, presumably Huawei executive detained US Canada.

If Canada passed vaccine testing countries would also wanted it. positions mutually exclusive either. death ""data point"" someone, may also still think broadly sad time. Funeral home workers time. can’t go back normal day I’m vaccinated even wanted parents support public health measures even vaccine, they’ll tighten household restrictions even get impression want let guard down. public health argument slam dunk. Weak immunity may lead variants even protects people short term. Gates money? /s figured one drivers (alongside end holiday parties/visits/travel) cases plummeting many states. feel 40% number unrealistic? Scared? no. fools talk like that. But, give thing respect give lethal animal kill you, take proper precautions. Unless think washing hands handling food ""Being fearful bacteria"", question without merit.  
Wear mask, social distance, sardine area, limit contacts get it, others tested. ""freedom"" pre COVID already gone permanently. stop? 3 masks better 2. Maybe mandate 12 masks per person. know evidence supports conclusion? Dumb question, exactly mean vaccine become ""widely available""? Like specific number doses distributed need reached?

Also, big gap timeline among widely available vaccine would available? Gottlieb said would come supply overtakes demand (which believes would happen late spring given Pfizer/Moderna orders), yet see many sub saying state vaccine widely available October?

Also fuck point articles ""at current rate vaccination, would take 7 years vaccinate entire American population return normal"" headline? don’t make sense everyone chance vaccinated else run issues discrimination really surprise. I’m betting doctors though bad flu strain late live US I'm entirely unable get first dose expect get one months. seems pretty supply constrained me. ain’t it, chief they're giving second dose! realize arriving decision refusing abide restrictions save lives personal fatigue less one year humanity’s first airborne blood disease places one camp April protestors now.

Perhaps, although feel somewhat false equivalency. point, know virus, spreads, take proper precautions, manage distancing masking, better treat it, look (symptoms)...the list goes on. *any* things belt idiots protesting right bat. really matter type virus driving pandemic, entitled individuals. 

If highly deadly virus lower transmission rate, we'd hear *""There's many people getting virus! statistical improbability contract it...OPEN UP!""* 

With virus like SARS2 highly transmissible, yet deadly, hearing *""It's many people dying! mostly elderly sick! 98% recovery rate...OPEN UP!""*

It's vaccine, virus, anything pure utter entitlement selfishness, masquerading ""freedom"". chance demonstrate care others something bigger yourself; sacrifice *something* get quicker less suffering. wide swath Americans failed test severely. Lots people voted candidate promised would “listen scientists” “follow science” disregard said scientists less one month term CoVID threatened “go away” like they’d thought. 

I, personally, know single person voted Biden saying this. administration wants open schools, something works long election. genuinely confused Scientists shunned listened to. Biden administration working full force implementing COVID management vaccine distribution. point see happening?  optimistic capacity overcome pressing challenges future see people “informed” crowd unwilling countenance science behind struggle lasts longer year.

Entirely agreed there. family changing anything, even vaccine. COVID broke out, knew going fight couple years, least. I'm fine that; pandemics general rarely resolve 2 years. think it’s possible things better summer I’m 100% convinced. new data showing 2 weeks, huge. shots making past 2 weeks factory persons arm right probably anyway. would require special freezers point process. sure entitles judge whatevs shoppers employees 22yo old stockers? partner runs department grocery store, employees elderly, immunocompromised, immunocompromised kids home. 

When one draws working grocery store good union health converge, get pretty diverse set people work there. 22yo shelf stockers- fact there's currently shortage those, least partner's store. Turnover really high pandemic, leaving lose work. can't social distance back grocery store, *very* risky, we've quarantined couple times due confirmed exposure. taken huge mental health toll workers; literally 10% frontline staff spent time rehab treatment last year things like alcoholism, drug addiction, eating disorders. They're terrified they're going kill one coworkers co-worker's family members name measly-ass paycheck.

Personally, I'd like see grocery workers higher list clear they're bearing disproportionate burden, state least placed 50+ health compromised grocery workers phase 1c, help. partner tentatively penciled April I'm really counting days. Finally, something working TJ Maxx paid off. might right second point brought up, I’m gonna pretend epidemiologist.

“We idea chance was. That's point. making decision little evidence either way”

Is true though? remember hearing subreddit data Pfizer submitted first dose around 60% effective, though data incomplete. I’ll try find links articles past. making seem like wild guess.This first vaccine we've ever analysed, know work know main purpose booster lasting immunity, medium term efficacy. explicit data exactly prove strategy, valid option recommended medical experts. 

The UK government massive list pandemic fuck ups, (so far) success story. reason vaccine needs mandatory can’t trust people mask abide social distance measures. many covidiots ignore science lick trumps boots think freedom taken masking showing compassion. means force vaccinate. opinions anti-vaxxers valid spreading like wildfire. 

It doesn’t take “like 10 years” study side effects. top scientists world spent year studying side effects vaccine many different body types. vaccine effects tested since Feb 2020. virus many scientists study virus make vaccines for. means study time reduced exponentially accuracy higher achieved faster. 

These scientists much experience anyone Fox News/Facebook meme research habits much credible coworkers opinions vaccine virus. defiant specialists know way I, juvenile may get hospitalized possibly killed. 

Bottom line, stop ignoring science. want get back normal life right? Get vaccine. Don’t choose ignorant. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

A point I'll concede, evidence far effiacy multiple vaccines time forthcoming fears strategy could lead immune escape allow variants resistant spread opposed vaccinating slowly letting new mutations occur general population Even year later look back turns right, wrong decision time based information had. Betting house 00 winning vindicate strategy, makes lucky idiot really think chucked pin dartboard said, 'Yep, that's new strategy'? scientists, based decision past data, people think dangerous, people think good idea. Science zero-sum game. Comparing decision, taking based evidence scientific method, describing roulette spin pretty disengious honest. results original Covid variants? speak myself, got second dose Pfizer vaccine two days ago, feel great. soreness arm received injection. I’m basing experience that, actually better first shot. arm sore initial dose. Don’t trust social media comments. They’re full foreign agents, kids, dummies trusting social media comments. apologies, may issue catch it. me, heart patient, likely would be. worth, vast majority AutoMod removed comments true positives. We're pretty hardline civility really want discussions denigrate political slapfighting, low effort ""ownage"" comments, threats harm like sometimes see rest site. wrong, far off. Here's NYC antibody testing delusional think people wanted undue psychological harm. pissed much Someone facebook page asking prosthetic stomach I'm wondering. read study israel (it's sub, pretty solid information lot countries consider. right guessing somewhat. run trial 2 dose vaccine regimen, opportunity observe efficacy one dose short period everyone gets second. 

Now 85% effect decent, doubt protection would fall cliff 4 weeks 12 weeks. limit exposure gap doses, like WFH, bad strategy. longer gaps doses often mean stronger immune responses.

To properly study need different trial groups getting second dose different times. seems like we're asking trouble decide go single dose route Pfizer potentially Moderna. normal freezer storage. represents real risk we're already *so close* finish line. ""you go work pandemic otherwise...um...hmm...it would violate civil liberties 🤷🏻‍♂️"" Gates Soros owe much money point. incivility 🛡 92-93% second dose. 85% first dose. I’m sure 60% figure haven’t seen it. eat indoors I’m insane. Everyone scared first UK variant seemed spread locked area. Cases plummeting UK South Africa, going Brazil. need remain cautious variants manageable. I’m hoping find in-person work Spring I’m letting guard anything else till least Q3 year. 2020 outlier. start Monty Python decade.

Accurate assessment. year absurd far. Nah, care I’m stupid. still eat indoors. Probably idea read calling garbage. clear legal issues vaccine passport denies access certain places without vaccine. 
That isnt say throw idea away, points need adressed. first person denied access concert goes court rules found accordance human rights, doesnt help helpful feel are. Canada. blows. US view learning experience start long process becoming less dependent China, won’t.

Democrats control house, senate presidency. going dependent ever China. Well version realistic different others. 

Some people already bar hopping club going. That’s statistically worth that’s reality them. Biontech/Pfizer study earlier? NHS paramedic here, got Pfizer believe. Pointing bad decision making hating UK  chance number boosted herd immunity large population already 2 shots?  tried linking accidentally got link thru google. mods said they'll allow removed edited title. explained mods said okay rescinded first allowance 2 issues instead 1 (even though issue independently allowed). asked one last time approved muted 28 days. Anyway, figured link nytimes directly am. think China bribes officials, give money buy individuals. It’s like FIFA buy board members Organization Nah, either care plain stupid. much politics worries me, individuals become consumed fear berate street it. hope go back times people making scene grocery store looked negative, something virtue signal Twitter with. ""I swear I'm leftist, think people health complications forced risk getting covid eat local Applebee's""

-this fucking idiot Here's part understand... 200M adults US, enough vaccine nearly half already, expecting ~full coverage sometime march, can't sign hold spot March/April? seems like reach certain availability threshold, rapidly approaching, ""Phase 1.3a/b/c"" stuff going slowing things try find last 5-10% ""phase"" moving on.  
 
At certain inflection point, deaths community spread going constrained getting shots arms instead scraping bottom barrel high-risk people. I’m sorry don’t understand comment. Single doses MRNA vaccine shows produces robust immunity. study Israel shows 85% immunity one Pfizer shot. Moderna Pfizer didn’t say findings, makes worried? Why? 

America’s children aren’t less likely get infected. don’t get tested symptoms barely noticeable all. 

Why would children U.K. infected everyone else was? That’s weird. fully vaccinated still don’t think it’s time rush back normal. I’m worried myself. never really entire time concern others reducing spread. Damn that’s good Thank you! Thanks! pretty common deflection criticism. ""Sure X horrible thing, remember time horrible thing?"" like excuse behavior. No, horrible things. 

It also starts make wonder often governments lie convenience/propaganda obvious one telling truth. many times lies happen without competing stories make dig deeper. may inconceivable some, people certain positions must look deaths hospitalized people ""just number"".

You may say ""that someone's mother, father, husband, etc.,"" try personify person, that's ideal world one one tasked easing restrictions prolonging them.

So yes, sad unfortunate perhaps, point (shortly US UK even Canada ramp-up) see death/hospitalization number dropping fast still non-zero, officials ease restrictions.

""But people still dying,"" correct may show indeed good heart, morally bankrupt view deaths whole region number greater good still alive trying get back track economically.

Just might comfortable ethical discussions, mean absolutely had. Thank you! Updated morning Wall Street Journal, ICYMI did. Highly effective even first dose, stored ordinary freezers, apparently unbothered variant. companies said seeking approval U.S. Food Drug Administration change vaccine’s storage rules, move would make much easier handle potentially accessible poorer countries access ultracold distribution storage Sahin, co-founder BioNTech, said temperature data would enable vaccine handled ordinary original clinical study showed 52.4% effectiveness one shot, didn’t differentiate two weeks. focused two-dose regime found 95% efficacy week second shot.

Simple point *wasn't* based existing knowledge. time evidence support yet, think Dr mentioned lately we've telephone appointments there's often alot time cover everything.

Brah 12 degrees outside gonna snow tomorrow. dare tell weather lovely (*mostly* kidding) Infected covid without question. got fuck Covid agree, want much everyone else I’m gonna holding mask burning parties running right back crowds day get second dose. 

I’m optimistic also trying realistic. think theory determine spreading flawed.

Particularly since ignores get wide spread adoption diverse group people awhile.

You go vaccinate grocery workers get 50% 60% uptake. leaves another 40% still spread 85 year old shops herself.

The dumbass gets bus nose hanging out? going find guy get shot infects 72 year old taking bus Dr's appointment?

The increase mortality risk among elderly insane.

An 80 year old 187x death rate 18-29 year old. That's crazy spread.

In house fire example, actually know what's fire. guess, target valuables first protect curtains, turns carpet fire, well lost valuables. Yes messaging around won’t stop transmission new variants. It’s frustrating public health officials need update messaging around double masking completely unmasked cough face, double mask lick good unless eyes protected. substitute masks entirely, extra layer protection folks. many different efficiency numbers confusing... last time heard 1st pfizer dose 50-60% effective preventing symptomatic case 80-90% preventing ventilation death, tge 2nd dose goes 95% &amp; 100%. Even Izrael said impressed results single dose, many people still got sick shots... 85% 1st shot? dont get it.... 85% younger people old people 2 shots already? Antibodies tell whole story, that's measure think underestimating immunity. Antibodies fade pretty quickly. Start counting day shot stupid. read correctly. 14 days average 15% previous two weeks. However compare 14 day average average early January-late December. 14 day average 6000 then. want see toll virus takes people check /r/COVID19Positive Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

I'm completely sure vaccines prevent disease sterilizing effect, could be. mostly matter effective category. guess it’s good don’t care or, honest, understand upvotes downvotes. Unfortunately vaccines require two doses vaccine per adult, \~255M adults US. there's enough 16% adults right now. end March enough 40% adults.

Yes, certain point, reduce restrictions let people sign up. They've gradually - if/when number signups slow, open new people. thread is. This. Lets overthink confirmed scientists. Lets move shit show. potentially let people get late spring/early summer. civil please. ""Montreal getting team"" rumour circulating since day expos left. Might happen, I've quit holding breath. Montreal needs new stadium first. really people think vaccine won’t help all? 99.99% dumbass. body temp 91F, need get hospital immediately already dead 😜 mean it'll work no, means highly likely work.

You're moving goalposts. r/conservative lmao, suprise bad take Remember Moderna said theres 92% effective, Pfizers Magically jumped 8% 85% like 93% overnight totally blue two days later?? Anyone? numbers marketing ploys, taken best test results. real results going atleast slightly different, alot, depending million real life variables. results trusted isnt companies making drugs telling great are. would hope that's case, people get complacent start pushing back. We've put long enough is. Around two really seems take effect. mostly likely infected point, possibly early day got vaccine. Hope anything dumb got shot.  Ahhhh. Thanks. tried google ""what variance requests"" got pages zoning, lol! actual table study results. Looking minute gave information scrolling nonsense 10. Increasing time looking reddit would yielded insight people computers think feel. nothing really vaccine. ever instance vaccine given pathogen experiencing waning immunity faster another vaccine pathogen immunogenic? fact points positives Chinas response negatives alone raises question, why? 

Along scientific/health organization also diplomatic organization. decision making body assembly members. unlike many UN orgs make decisions solely secretariat level. tries avoid criticizing country help it. becomes even pressing goal countries like China, US, Euro-bloc involved. countries/groups huge amount influence countries WHA.  office national statistics representative sample survey week various things including compliance latest data, released today  whole family got 'rona, pretty much asymptomatic I'm pretty healthy tbh even though asthma, mom one suffered (this means slightly longer flu) complete fine now.

Scientists literally starting tell us masks useless (as said March 2020), ready listen them?

Sweden close schools hurt that.
They banned masks useless are.
I even like sweden fucking Based Yeah I'm getting PCR later today id dont get Monday I'll take rapid test well. I'm sure one accepting since website doesnt say. Well, they're not? They're still working tiers. whole staff vaccinated May, far handful gotten first shot, think gotten both.

Supply different issue; talking priority order think grocery workers placed higher disproportionate mental, physical, emotional burden keeping us fed pandemic. deserve relief, like war way healthcare workers probably relate best. think you’re misinterpreting data. Cases 15% 2 weeks ago, however 50% month ago (when height global spike was). risk getting deleted, going months. Anti-maskers, covidiots, anti-vaxxers, anti-doing-anything-about-this-virus. upvoted right now, change brigade charges in. 

Literally mask argument someone earlier boasting wear mask public ""no one seems mind.""

I see usernames saying things well. moved California. lockdown. Every single friend left either Portland Seattle last months. 

And we're queer hell, we're supposed demographic stayed here. exodus numbers going shock people finally come in. Sorry going try convince Trump briefed virus, told Bob Woodward serious was, nothing help public, blamed opponents countries, called hoax, laughed people wearing masks, played doctor hyping various medications including bizarrely bleach, could done anything better someone else's fault, going work. leader charge consequences fault. even, politicize mask wearing? lockdown hard

I live Orlando, one biggest tourist destinations world. Last year, March June, city practically ghost town, even Disney World closed several months.

Anyone thinks Florida lockdown hard states early trying push kind agenda.  Well everyone get second dose UK 12 weeks latest issue. seems little space discussion. It’s either “open everything right now. Masks useless. Fuck fauci” “the vaccine won’t solve anything masks 2025 social distance forever” hypocrites. 

We already know it’s true. vaccinated congress, watched line get it.

It’s Republicans break rules either (it’s largely them) let’s forget democrats like Gavin Newsome, Lori Lightfoot etc caught breaking quarantine rules first get vaccinated. 

Every single local, state federal politician put top list. Lots even took camera “show” safe is, find largely disingenuous excuse think deserving average person. first said came Australia, saying came Maryland? Can't keep story straight, they? restrictions go way dodo anyone easily\* get vaccinated, save young kids small number legitimately cannot get vaccine. could see restrictions unvaccinated encourage get it, requiring doctor's note fly without vaccination point, mostly dependent close get herd immunity left apprehensive anti-vaxxers.

\*Easily means vaccine open crazily refreshing pharmacy appointment sites 3 days get That's really nice attitude! Careful, fact get banned here. discuss 2 million number widespread overhyping ""horrible side effects,"" really can't blame people saying bother. mean...I want vaccine either knew let go back normal life way *and* I'd probably get another one later *and* they'd make feel like shit days. making seem like vaccine make life better, actually makes temporarily worse. 

It would nice people got vaccine objectively right thing do, that's realistic. give people form incentive. ""You're probably gonna get COVID!"" incentive people afraid getting COVID first place.

[I'm saying someone much wants vaccine second I'm eligible despite awful messaging.] confirmed cases. Even developed countries, under-reporting rates estimated 4-5X. developing countries, combination age demographics leading lower severity infections weaker healthcare systems means underreporting rates even higher - likely 20-25X. 

The best way get estimate actual cases globally work backwards deaths (which, still under-reported, less under-reported cases). estimate age-band IFR rates based estimates countries suffer least under-reporting / easiest model total infection figures apply global age demographics. 

Even using conservative IFR .3% get floor 800 million cases based 2.5 million confirmed deaths. Given under-reporting deaths fact global IFR likely lower (due age demographics), easy see actual number global cases 1 billion. 

Take India extreme example underreporting. Seroprevalence New Delhi 50%. India 11 million confirmed cases; New Delhi population 20 million. words, New Delhi alone many cases (based antibody testing) confirmed India whole (based confirmed PCR tests). New Delhi 1.5% population India (20M 1,300M people). I'm indoors, wear kn95 cloth mask it. outside unlikely meet people, use disposable mask. I'm going talking outside someone wear cloth mask. That's probably correlative like includes cumulative protection combination mask wearing social distancing. important stat vaccine. science inconsistent, makes lose confidence side effect stats. thing mutation, though, systems naive least. know anyone checking closely. Rapids less accurate. want PCR, need today tomorrow get results back time.  think 7 day average probably keep decreasing, *rate* drop definitely lower. There's gotta people kinda feel shitty, enough brave ice covered roads get tested.

Like see case rate fell cliff January 9th January 25th, kept plummeting now, much. fervently hope so. They’ve known decades hid baby powder contains asbestos. It’s linked cancer daily baby powder users, especially women use bathing suit parts. pay billions, insist they’re taking market it’s selling. There’s great podcast called “verified” season it. Reminds tobacco pretty inarguable best vaccine actually. two frankly come close moderna Novavax. details examining lab data especially looking South Africa variant, Pfizer pills pretty decisively ahead two, almost point I'd say moderna Novavax need new vaccines, Pfizer, might actually clear kind edge.

I'd happily take three offered me. ones I'm much fence much reluctant. sure you’re getting voted. first thought fuck would Sure. said likely fatal. However, even single digit % fatal majority people would willing risk. ideal ultimately major problem. people getting vaccinated good thing regardless live Oregon that’s EXACTLY happening here. got vaccine fighting return. believe they're fairly far along phase 3 trial, find soon.

And agree ""winner"" comment. BioNTech went largely unknown rock star status, Pfizer's brand value must grown tremendously. well deserved, creating arguably best vaccine able produce large quantities.

AstraZeneca, hand... accomplished, phase 3 trials disaster, may well turn biggest loser story. Ironically enough, consider others, like Sanofi, failed completely.  grade 9-12 kids get educated person vs online essential compare food medical care. False equivalency. supermarkets provide food, everyone starves. 10th graders largely thrive using online education. This... Basically developing countries waiting developed countries get doses Novavax J&amp;J. happens doses quickly get shipped developing countries One reasons could variant lasts average 13 days, 10 people may leaving isolation still infections. think they're gonna held back hispanic people. case fatality rate humans, near lethal enough endanger species.  kids too... Actually let's vaccinate everyone. mention don’t know keeps people spreading it. I’d rather go restaurant nobody vaccinated sick there’d higher chance they’d realize it. Covid never “very likely fatal,” even you’re 100 years old. matter age bracket health profile, odds survival always favor. Literally expert given timeline. Man pessimistic. also spread higher rates teachers see 100s kids HS. Grade school kids also surprisingly compliant rules. Wow. incredible volume shots per day small pharmacy. basically choose too... there’s check it. Cuomo done stuff would easily supported 2/3rds people New York State pandemic 2/3rds New York politicians. doesn’t accountability right lotsa volunteers. lotsa prep. Also keep mind significant drop influenza year, since deaths haven’t happened usual numbers add tally. say normally 100000 die influenza year 20000, add 80000 excess deaths.
I say I’m Canadian, Canada (where mask wearing pretty much norm) flu numbers dropped almost zero despite significant increase testing looking it. Even though infection rates low again, true chances someone getting Covid higher September last year since number people don’t immunity decreasing ?

Basically chances getting Covid higher around September? article disingenuous. freezer requirements least vaccines make impractical countries without infrastructure. certainly best interest world make sure countries vaccine. premature supply everyone. rich countries share, take bit time. see type article nothing ""pressure"". Meanwhile San Francisco shut one mass vaccination sites enough doses provided city. love supply ramping distribution handled properly well reading posts Twitter nothing quote hand. less curovac numbers phase one two look like AZ Pfizer. Pfizer big winner biontech.moderna novavax also fare decently.

The problem going developed countries nobody want vaccine Pfizer. developing countries difficult justify vaccine Novavax considering substantial efficacy advantages AZ JNJ least non South Africa strain.  Hey it’s rare day Arizona Florida something right :) hear many stories shitty work PCP big corporate group practice. somebody gonna crappy day work either way.

And honestly, efficient way deliver results. is, blunt, exactly want comes COVID vaccine--shots arms efficiently possible. really time artisanal vaccinations here. references Curevac? know strangely quiet them, know anything specific. Interestingly, future another virus circulating humans “a common cold” virus mutates humans adapted either catching virus developing resistance getting vaccinated developing resistance. makes feel little better 2nd moderna dose postponed. revieved now, waiting suck come.

Yeah don’t understand 180 degree turn sub made last months. 

Remember we’re almost guys. Cases, hospitalizations, deaths dropping quickly, vaccines rolled out, many states lifting restrictions already. Vaccine escape inevitable, want much time possible vaccination vaccine escape. That’s can’t play fast loose things like switching one dose vaccinations, increase risk selecting variants overcome vaccines. Meanwhile Florida government setting VIP shots wealth zipcodes governor threatens take shots counties aren’t nice him. Sound familiar?

I’ll take shots eye point. sounds like lovely man. It’s actually moo point. It’s like cow’s opinion, nobody cares. Yeah, I'm lost sentence trying say well. get 17/355 figures? It’s like someone says “loosing weight”. add that, percentage Americans kind underlying condition puts additional risk? High blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, history smoking, etc.? issue antibiotic resistant bacteria people don’t finish regimen-the resistant bacteria still around able replicate continue mutate. Thats within individual population true wish could get vaccinated right now. Unfortunately don’t yet meet conditions. make difference model whether people immune they've virus vaccine.

Eventually herd immunity; question expensive get there. 

I think likely we'll done couple months. Vaccine resistance inevitably emerge, developing world reservoir infection.

I think take year get control point restrictions ended developed world, probably still need travel restrictions control spread new variants developing world extended period. Refusing vaccine doesn’t directly affect others health, especially she’s still following mitigation protocols. vaccine still voluntary basis military etc. see problem that. understanding 2nd dose helps little effectiveness real benefit long effectiveness lasts. single dosing everyone we’d start months. 

1st dose = months
2nd dose = year +

I could totally wrong someone please correct misinformed. California? hasn’t “lockdown” That's good point, think realistically way plausible he/she works nursing home, therefore interacts bunch older generally frail folks.

At time, unusual high percentage nursing home residents pass away annual basis, he/she would expect certain extent. sister law works one seems like every three weeks someone passes away. Pfizer moderna, J&amp;J really necessary? seems like Pfizer Moderna able supply enough vaccinate every adult wants one April/May, right? grocery store workers interact lot different individuals every single day. Many listed interact many people people. also matters jobs allow take sick leave. others work sick need make rent. explaining Taiwan regime underdog unfinished Chinese civil war. agree, especially say tweak booster protect strains prevalent time booster (likely fall). death count: don’t buy argument death undercount. look excess mortality statistics, elevated mortality 2020 matches fairly well reported COVID deaths. 

As cases cratering now: herd immunity threshold lower infection controls place (e. g. people masking, restriction indoor gatherings, etc). would agree already reached threshold. another 20-30% vaccinated people (~2 months), past herd immunity threshold case restrictions place.
I think definitely towards end pandemic (in US, countries take bit longer vaccination rates lower). personally don’t think patchwork rules US caused 500,000 people die. even close.

I think public health experts arrogant measures end shown largely ineffective, consequences real. Think aids drugs given cocktail antibiotic resistant bacteria becoming prevalent. concern slow transmission virus need vaccinate people public sees. One jobs grocery store workers. Truck drivers essential interact people. bus drivers see lots different people enclosed space day. job need interact person lots unique individuals priority.  studies moderna vaccine transmissible COVID received vaccine? Thank awesome soda Came post this. remember reading swore 30% effective first dose. it? cynical know there’s pressure get vaccine people, influencing studies?

Anecdotally, sister brother law got first shot Pfizer two weeks later got covid.

We've seen 100M slip end June ""end June beginning July.""

This likely beginning J&amp;J going become poster child government contractors overpromising underdelivering. People use case study program management decades come. would case states, happened Florida governor threatened withhold vaccines counties whined. common sense passed backseat. Random thought, feel like know good amount people personally COVID, think know anyone personally old-fashioned cold past season? like forget common cold still realm possibilities necessarily COVID nothing. I’m sure that’s true. higher spread virus, higher replication rate opportunity variants. slow spread disease reduce replication mutation well. Yes variants vaccines protect them-just well original. think it’s accurate say variants able spread original Syrian still much reduced rates. Vaccine escape going (has already happened?)

I think stretch point towards happenings imply mixed signals sent. I'm ""fuck Andrew Cuomo"" guy necessarily, publication *American Crisis: Leadership Lessons COVID-19 Pandemic* absolutely *hysterical*. Around ~40 kids Kawasaki disease 1-2 months covid infection. (This Hungary) Fortunately treated easily. global number see reported 100 million. provide source claim billion? authorities bar Palestinians obtaining Lebanese nationality working many skilled professions, refugees largely make living low-paid labour construction crafts, street kicked inoculation programme Sunday, said vaccinate Palestinian Syrian refugees along rest population. depends start counting too. start day shot, lowers effectivity considerably. sounds like bad planning local DOH. Moderna vaccine mostly reserved pharmacies, local clinics, etc. Pfizer reserved large hospitals, mass vaccination sites, etc. 

I can't think single pharmacy dispenses Pfizer right now. Yet UK funding production vaccine back May 30 million due delivered September 2020 part total 100 million. still allowed AZ start setting supply chain whereas far I’m aware EU agreement end August.

If want ignore pretty crucial bit information continue fuel anger that’s Massachusetts, one comorbidity, pretty much ever smoked tobacco, eligible also former smoker. doctor advised he'd sign getting phase medical authorization needed.

Considering self-attestation form pains penalties perjury, someone wants legal consequence lie. Many people listed interact people constantly. essential job many unique individuals come contact them. overwhelming majority still get groceries store priority. Can't really agree can't hit 4M still sticking distribution plan.

Granted, phased release long 4M day, there's plenty 65s pre-existing conditions essential employees get vaccinating light verification process (IE: ""Hey, look shit confirm one 7 categories"") stop us hitting high numbers vaccines it. Whatever happened Kawasaki disease kids? remember hearing like every second beginning pandemic, havent heard thing months now. early tests scientific, like dogs detected covid turns samples came different hospitals dogs may smelling difference hospitals, virus itself. studies since.

My question can't build device measurement. super cute awesome dogs help save world take DNA sample cheek swab can't build device detects virus sample? would like see else funding program, proportional economy. so, cool. Otherwise, really unless countires forced step contribute equal amount % GDP. 

I know 4 billion really lot scheme US government, others dumb us play world protector. understand struggle. also see executive order makes sense now. US got hit COVID worst terms number infections deaths counted.

Same thing masks. hit hard lack PPE. makes sense government would make decision stop exporting.

Also thought heard Canada surplus vaccine donating it’s extra countries need Canadians want get vaccinated vaccinated. would hope US same.

Ethically knows? think it’s debate. don’t necessarily think it’s unethical prioritize country first don’t think it’s unethical vaccinate need share countries finish vaccinating general population. It’s black white. 

Regarding Canadian friends pleased US, wouldn’t either last four years living us. think welded people inside homes reason Wuhan! No...it’s safely activity without fear anymore Oh great, big freezer scamming us all. Well according sub wait come April live in-store mask compliance hovers somewhere north 99.9% yet covid numbers pretty much match broader national trends well trends rural areas state mask compliance less universal. No, not, upvote mine, likewise, would miserable. People need vaccine otherwise would major threat. shouldn’t getting downvoted. Op changed title rules subreddit. Also charging $4 pop companies.  numbers mean lot people think mean. Like Pfizer shot said ""50% effective one dose"". measured period 25 days includes 12 days became effective. 25 days 90% averaged 50%. one explanation this.

To nonsense, like saying, team 0 points start game 24 points end game scored average 12 points. people care final score. realize people hated former president **and** think blanket lockdowns restrictions best way handle pandemic, it'll easier digest fact transcends politics, comments like nothing move us along Americans. We'll probably need get boosters every years variants foreseeable future case.

The J&amp;J vaccine single-dose, expect produce billion doses end year. Great info. thanks. internet big place hard make heads tails covid information cause big concern given 100s 1000s new articles opinion pieces published day. good summary.

 me, like stay information control much. try take reasonable precautions stay safe thankful vaccines getting rolled good pace US jump chance turn comes get vaccinated. 

I'm even glass half full person stay sane can't focus trying predict things like summer fall. Things changed rapidly new information comes new studies come out. vaccines seem promising especially pfizer/moderna seems like we're getting better place day people get vaccinated. actual things Biden changed fix this? can't recall making policy changes. I'd go another months. kid 1 risk hospitalized (not mortality) higher then. 

Not though. Kid needs joy. European Union announced today additional €500 million COVAX Facility, doubling contribution date global initiative leading efforts secure fair equitable access safe effective COVID-19 vaccines low middle-income countries. new pledge brings us closer achieving COVAX's target deliver 1.3 billion doses 92 low middle-income countries end 2021. Team Europe one lead contributors COVAX €2.2 billion, including another €900 million pledged today Germany. 

Today also news Germany pledged another 1.5 billion euros COVAX, know would fit 2.2 billion euros pledged EU members (the numbers really add up, Germany already pledged 1.5 billion, add individual member states pledges 2.2 billion euros). already path holidays. again, see statements theory one could infected spread virus even fully vaccinated,” Dr. Rebecca Wurtz University Minnesota told me. “Is ambiguous messaging contributing ambivalent feelings vaccination? Yes, question.”

I've seen quite bit sub too. Instead saying ""you might able still contagious vaccine"", common seen ""still wear mask! still spread it"". big difference ""we know can"" ""you can"". generation's Great Depression. carry scars years come, affect decisions outlooks ways can't estimate yet. matter...

Go mourn stop beating straw men probably scared, prioritize relatively minor expected inconvenience (getting ill seriously so) others' real risks. candles? Stone cold greed fantastic result. also important note 85% efficacy would almost certainly result near-total drop hospitalizations deaths, even symptomatic cases.

Basically, COVID would become like mild cold everyone. quite clear. said vaccine slows spread stops symptoms, restrictions based asymptotic transmissions right? entirely new way making vaccines. I'm sure decades they'll vaccines able fully effective day 1.

Go look up.

Please show evidence belief press India completely free like say is. I've provided proof isn't. Obviously, deluded can't. we? virus extremely high survival rate people.. risk going hospital vaccinated, really reason shut everything down.

At point, healthy people choice either continue shelter homes rejoin society take small risk goes it.

Wasn't whole point overwhelm health services? conditions ""victory?"" Goalposts keep moving much. think good point, could even virus significantly reduced spread warm months, even reduced spread could significant.

Also think testing started increase last summer increased testing finds increased cases. whole case count thing terrible metric begin combines serious illness positive tests.

I personally think virus process burning i.e. infected many people enough population immunity slow spread. called yet? Maybe know reputable brands like CUOMOXA Obuby shopping products? know people order stuff Amazon idea coming from. Like something show China confused ""well ordered Amazon, arent warehouses USA?"" Literally quotes article sure high rate risk death vaccinated. many children miss education protect workers privileged considered essential? understand problems Michigan Washington? routed south?

Anyone says dentistry isn’t essential never suffered tooth gum emergency. amazing poorly educated people regards science, easy manipulate ""science talk"" create sensational headlines. started everywhere China, China best ! Fuck China. obvious 85% effectiveness good enough get R &lt; 1 margin variants high R0, especially given uptake &lt; 100%. 

If want R = 1 without NPIs intuitively

  ηrequired = 1 - (uptake / R0) 

If R0 5 85% vaccine effectiveness would bring R unity 75% total population vaccinated. vaccinating children would need high uptake everybody else.

We know long immunity lasts single dose vaccine. 

I think perfectly reasonable start single dose delay 2nd dose 12 weeks per current UK government policy, think reasonable abandon second dose entirely. better single-dose AZ JJ vaccines. 

This depends. big question long levels immunity last - main point booster [extend 

The Oxford vaccine, lower ~76% efficacy, data supports 12 week gap w/ decline immunity. hand, study tracked days 15-28 post-first jab. basis went 6 week gap, could justify something like 14 week gap Oxford one, level flexibility offsets 9% difference. 

Obviously there's even - health workers, vaccine might work less well exposed unusually high viral loads. practice, limited data mean Pfizer immunity also last 12+ weeks. Would nice data though. guy's data says. OC43 peaks December. 

It's possible SC2 similar that. parents got second shots, I'm currently least stressed I've ever covid. 'living way' mean wearing mask outside maybe? cares? normalized asia decades think they're fine.

What? would figure earlier. make damn thing dont know handle. reusable five-layer, double-filter mask good double masking? shelled last summer: guidelines I've seen emphasize fit filter definitely good I'm expert. Would better ordering surgical masks put standard fabric kind? Unfortunately, many people lack nuanced thinking everything’s black white. Especially since, know, pandemic isn’t even yet. There's two key parts it: getting new vaccines approved getting distribution/logistics place many sites available possible.

The current method hoping clicking get appointments incredibly frustrating. That's even harder anyone tech savvy unfortunately include lot older folks. fixed getting places pharmacies even general practitioners people work normal doctors get fixed. best way get get vaccines approved improved manufacturing.

I know spell basic form, pretty simplistic dealt logistics years, one slip, especially manufacturing level basically increases time exponentially every step adds delays top it.

Long story short, Johnson Johnson getting approved huge shorten timeframe, 1 shot doubles distribution capability Moderna/Pfizer. I'd love see J&amp;J get opened 3rd phase since little less effective 2 Moderna/Pfizer keep rolling older folks essential workers. Creating two pronged approach significantly lower distribution time get Phase 3 people line likely April early May.

After becomes production challenges making enough everyone. likely take months get fully available may mid-Summer. working conjunction less infection spread overall get us pandemic mode around time walk pharmacy request vaccine.

I've generally bit pessimistic past year I'm seeing light end thing. need grind months FINALLY get side. Joe Biden covering cases make look better!!1

Pasty White Man Bad! downvoted sub flipped populated people downvote anything blindly positive. people commenting even read second half article explaining even ""normal"" summer pandemic over.

I wish could split subs: one purely positive news. People could go one rejoice every article talking summer going great. could burn effigies Fauci talk ""experts"" arrogant. brought articles expressing caution still wear masks distance. articles could go sub, people want understand facts, good bad, read outlook updates experts. 

I want end asap, many reasons personal benefit society. think ignoring anything negative makes upset going help. know people permanently lost taste smell regular cold prior year 2000. it’s super notable symptom accompanied clod, can’t smell, everything tastes like cardboard... COVID go without symptoms, people notice loss smell taste absence symptoms, symptoms set in. regular cold, one cared symptoms one talking separately part deadly virus. could also buy filter cloth mask mentioned article.  true. Using China labor like one step benefiting slavery. conditions pay factories inhuman. it’s ok long it’s backyard don’t see it, isn’t happening. full size ultra low freezer metal storage racks, alarm system installed validated runs 15K. don’t know exactly big vials are, able store least 3,000 18,000 doses worth.

What makes Pfizer harder Moderna pharmacist needs dilute hand shots 6 hours. Moderna’s ready go vial stored thawed fridge 30 days. worried could carrier high risk situation, I'd probably double mask.

I run Costco feeling fine exposed anyone outside household. Biden could enact plan listed comment now. Like, could today. isn’t he? according epidemiologist article.

But regardless, N95 widely available protect user, mask mandate? I’ve seen articles claiming sides here, hard evidence. dropped 65+ 2 comorbidities yesterday. some, yes. me, I’m ready get back normal soon I’ve received final shot waited requisite two weeks ensure shot fully effective. that, I’m going back living life. Mine March far you.

 never forget cough long live. feeling lungs lived duration.

I seemingly got pretty lucky seems left enough still function much beyond that. bought exercise machine pre outbreak honest I'm terrified using seeing much leg room virus left me.

My Dr medical leave (she baby) medically poked around much. Much like exercise machine.. I'm nervous learning finer details long term issues.

How guys coping adjustment post covid? Hopefully get complete smack down!  would hate mod virtually sub significant general interest. rise amateur professional propagandists, along exponential growth chatbots, social media dead major topics. aren’t talking peers conversations get overwhelmed people specific agendas. evil profitable good, dominated dark side. 

Eventually social media shutdown damage causes humanity. Pandemics proven effective way profit propaganda campaigns. Great read, damn time. Let preface comments saying 100% supporter believer science.

How FUCK know freezer piece now? tested? kind shit exactly causes 42% America believe trust science. failure. difference approving J&amp;J spacing doses vaccines? Well store manager/pharmacist, lot work divided among lot people, much work all.

From distributor standpoint, another vaccine/drug, easier setting PODs. still set for, say, nursing homes uninsured, could get away half many, etc.. It’s okay, admit care nationalism winning points right thing.

Science isn’t zero sum game. It’s like U.K. strategy pulled thin air. Definitely good hear, love meaaaaan, much want shiz get back normal, makes expert hahahh need remember numbers senior population known less strong immune response. Great news! article posted somewhere immunity lasting 8 months infection. Late May-Early June one favorite times year. 

I’ll usually plop couch watch whiparound coverage day (unless Clemson Georgia game)

I need one make back Omaha excuse finally go. 

Also see guys Zesto there, kind one Columbia here? number seems unrealistic. would 40% people us caught it.. Add vaccines we'd 50% level resistance.. think we'd seeing drastic reduction Rt we've seen last month many already resistant.. Rt states dropped 1.1-1.2 0.8 lower last month alone casually implies response vaccine (I know, correlation causaution).  That's necessary. Covid lower risk children flu. arab world treats Palestinians horribly. Levantine arabs ethnically similar traditions, grant citizenship. Palestinians still refugees war happened 70 years ago. Single ply toilet paper 90% effective blocking snot sneeze. 1/8th inch lexan 92% effective.

Durability immunity matters. science right proof. experts NHS top Canadian institutes pushing months. seen drop efficacy That's stupid. young people low risk covid, they're ones suffering probably age group. nobody seems even care, disgraceful. teachers worried give vaccine they're protected, problem solved. I'm high risk so, unpopular answer, get covid. Thankfully i'm vaccinated unlikely happen yeah talking free trade benefits us people developing countries enormously Okay see point. it’s like Atlantic hasn’t published articles gloomier topics before. cause war. trials began July ended December. even half year since participants got second dose.

We actualy proof lasts beyond that, use expert knowledge here. severe GAD/pure OCD (self-harm type) well went several years therapy. don’t know assumed haven’t deal - inappropriate *you* 😉. ERP couple years helped.

ERP considered gold standard many well lot sources. therapist called gold standard well.

I’m saying 2,000,000 deaths isn’t lot take account world population 7,000,000,000. realize that’s .02% world’s population? many advanced age frail begin with? we’ve destroyed world economy hurt poor young WAY rich. 

I see point ridicule dismissal - kinder rather ridiculing.

Lastly, want add completely cured GAD/OCD sleep test identified UARS, puts body fight flight mode. got treated anxiety vanished - something ERP SSRI’s couldn’t do. Check article out: want rule UARS, get watchpat sleep test Lofta Amazon detect it. Feel free PM questions it...doesn’t hurt check :) That's okay. lot American's feeling goodwill towards Canadians considering mocking &amp; condescending tones. Lucky!! live Oklahoma isn’t case. Trying get tested vaccinated still shitshow. :( reminds picking hitchhikers going toll get high-occupancy/carpool oversimplified math. can't possbily expect transmisison identical unvaccinated vaccinated individuals even 33% show symptoms. Really? That's great! People freak cases doubt they're good thing deaths going down, means immunity less pressure vaccination programs since less people need it. Probably reorganizing pain every store across nation. presenting positives ignoring negatives reason caution propaganda? THREE testing sites (not run state) within 2 miles house West Burbs Chicago. another state run testing site four miles away indoor testing. want test, get test. Completely reasonable call. Put oxygen mask first assisting others. want protect catching virus, N95 KN95 mask much better choice two cloth masks surgical masks. Likewise got February ,pretty much issues still, plus blood clots wife son. 4.6x109,902,859 (the number Feb 17th, recent number CTV website) 505,553,151.4, slightly higher half billion, much less billion.

To clear, I'm saying lot cases, want people making unbacked claims bad things are. double mask. I'm spending money disposable masks whole hamper cloth masks. know long lasts two, don’t we? trials vaccines performed two dose regiment, people originally got vaccine still antibodies cells almost year later (and likely last many years).

The way understood single shot trial, example immunity lasts 2 months level single shot, it’s still better stick two dose regiment. 

We don’t data long single dose regiment lasts, I’m inclined agree it’s safer ethical follow done trial. AstraZeneca's promises starting sound like Comcast's promises. Honestly, friends back states hit hard stuff, going science one reasons US position it’s in. China pushing bullshit?

Color surprised. CNN: Afraid....BE AFRAID! Coming next....Could Donald Trump planning 2024 run? Nothing ""normal"" &amp; never normal 🤔🙄😑 Good know.....Wish Canada.....yup.... waiting mean we're open criticism, there's still line incivility. live Omaha, NE confirm this.

There's really reason expect align anyone's sense who's deserving undeserving. understand global trend lol???? 

Canada nearly exact decline US has. 10k piece local parm spent. serious could deadly usually easily treated caught time.  Yeah you’re US there’s literally 40% chance you’ve already, that’s seroprevalence data shows. Probably true 50/50 chance you’re major metropolitan area. need to. Catching virus recovering give level immunity would've got vaccine. estimated lasts least 9 months probably more. Press release freezing: [Pfizer BioNTech Submit COVID-19 Vaccine Stability Data Standard Freezer Temperature U.S. listening Daily podcast (NY Times) morning host said “there evidence vaccine stops transmission”. waiting “expert” talking correct him, didn’t happen. went say wearing masks hit herd immunity, know going happen, kids 25% population. Combine stats already know (60% nursing home employees refuse, 1/3 military refuse, cops firefighters refuse) number parents anti-vaxxers Fauci’s 80-90% number never happen. 

It’s us demand return life hospitalizations deaths fall almost nothing every adult wants vaccinated ability without making appointment. also great economic pressure states like New York, Illinois, California reopen states like Florida, Texas, Indiana, Missouri, Tennessee, start poach big events states refuse open. think summer see MLB stadiums filled capacity (Miami, Tampa, Dallas, Phoenix, Houston) we’ll see others (Chicago, NYC, Boston, LA, SF, Seattle) remain empty.

Curious. Fair point. [Here’s archive Stop posting, Matt. Focus book don’t make sense majority population vaccinated. It’s dumb idea tech companies seem pushing for. researchers use ascertainment bias 5-10x estimate actual infections. would take 5.8x confirmed cases get 50% population. That, average since beginning pandemic, we've caught 15-20% cases testing seems possible.  responses reddit completely benign questions always snarky sarcastic? 

No, think completely baseless, reason research first place, results sometimes counterintuitive. multiple vaccines, too. Johnson Johnson one one believe quoted 60% effective.

I know. numbers first Pfizer shot. feel like studies extremely inconsistent. *delay* would hope still get 2nd, maybe 12 weeks later rather 4 😊 I'm hearing professional

Writing op-ed proclaim herd immunity, even linking [this Lancet article] herd immunity well documented.

Uh, yes; national association doctors UK thought *exactly that*. decision delay second dose political decision, government happened get lucky time. Unsure responded link, [the CDC advises wait 90 days risk currently CTRL-F 90 Days takes relevant section. Wrong. Look Katalin Karikó.

Every decision lockdown extend restrictions, well decisions open back up, political ones made politicians. I'm doctor researcher, listen experts. 


Among concerned Paul Bieniasz, virologist Rockefeller University. “Rolling partially effective vaccine regime peak highly prevalent viral epidemic great idea one goals avoid vaccine resistance,” says.

There’s chance, Bieniasz explains, people waiting second dose may sub-optimal level immunity places selective pressure virus. someone become infected interval jabs, pressure could allow emergence mutant version SARS-CoV-2 able shake person’s immune response—a so-called escape variant. variant also proved capable causing severe disease could potentially spark whole new, devastating wave infections 

""If lesser immune response, getting first dose, likely wound virus kill it,"" Dr. Paul Offit, vaccine researcher Children's Hospital Philadelphia, said last week call reporters.

If kill virus, Offit said, still opportunity mutate.

The boost response second dose, Fauci said, gives ""greater breadth response,"" meaning protect ""wild type"" coronavirus circulating, also variants gaining foothold U.S. No, still flew, increased security, limits placed could bring along. we're still them, 20 years later. already seeing dips cases vaccinations people already it. I'm favor getting many people possible first shot follow months infrastructure strongest get 2nd. thing is, *was evidence today*. UK went gut feeling intuition, rather following study results. appears got lucky, time, dosage strategy. jury still whether betting majority vaccination regimen lower-efficacy AZ design good long term decision.

What everyone except UK saying would great adjust dosage intervals, there’s good chance would able to, needed data support decision. That’s Pfizer struck deal Israel run study, it’s great news likely able adjust strategies based that. 

It emphatically make gut feeling based decisions UK made vindicated retrospect; every scrap pharmaceutical industry process exists prevent exactly sort gambling people’s lives, many historical examples severe consequences lapse rigor. “low incidences” yet aren’t haven’t reopened. Obviously enough people vaccinated greatly mitigate spread country open. Hope troll legit dumbass It’s gonna different US safety-wise, places deciding say “fuck it”. live, even vaccine guarantee I’ll still wear mask everywhere, won’t able go inside bar, indoor concerts/events, discouraged gathering indoors non-household members...the “normal” going cities states ignoring public health guidance pretending virus went away Yes, possibility variant surge *only* reason US consider far tell. UK chose path throes surge likely worth risk. past holiday surge expecting vaccine glut soon. see argument first doses would reduce potential variant surge also worry long term effect would vaccine hesitancy bigger long term obstacle. latter important thankfully one making decision. PCR red flag. detect old infections, ongoing exposure without replication even totally false positives. Vaccine may better think. previous method storing vaccines special freezers precaution? so, couldn’t experimented vaccines determine highest temperature stored with?

I hope much money spent freezers. multiple vaccines, too. Johnson Johnson one one believe quoted 60% effective.

This saying single dose Pfizer vaccine (it's 2-dose vaccine) 85% effective awesome. closer 95/96% couple weeks 2nd dose.

Moderna 92/93% believe. We're working it! suggestions, please let us know :) accurate. drowning person unknowingly drown you. people spread hate parties clubs ones believe needed society (pandemic not). Careful say anything get support. depends state arriving in, airline require covid test. we’re almost guys.

It depends ask. Fauci think back normal 2022.

If let virologists decide, keep us lockdown forever. always COVID. always respiratory illnesses. Lol. surprised slightest. able find this: Bottom Line

Scientists don’t yet know sure effects receiving vaccination actively sick COVID-19. now, evidence infected COVID-19 changes effectiveness vaccine causes bodily harm.

from Miami Herald suggests necessarily bad idea, recommended supplies short (hence official position)--I wondering clearer evidence. spread disease, vaccine block, reducer. said main account back March well members sub stalk/harass/try dox me. airlines that? recently flew US check anything. look spike last spring New York, cases peaked April went almost zero mid June stayed low fall. seems sharp spikes sharp fall offs part life cycle virus. till actual vaccine takes care it, we're stuck things are. one reduces symptoms, makes survivable. yes, felt way flu TB, got sick, stayed home. Even cost job, stayed home protected others germs. thoughtlessness people going forth spreading disease. 


BTW, done lockdown right, opened Memorial Day weekend, might mess we're currently in. proper lockdown would choke give us time get PROPER vaccine. problem people get shot, drive directly bar stop following safety guidelines. 

From science perspective, right. public health data needs reflect reality stupid public. Pshhhh, follow *that* science, Science™️ employer us come back office March.   Nice thanks heads up. Getting waiting list now! Good news personal advice based experience however.  That's point. us want read good bad. want read good lose minds hint negative news trepidation.

Well they've gone 2 bankruptcy's. companies never learn. US, vaccines generally available adults May. There's higher chance eaten Great White. *In bathtub* Lol stuck 2020?

Boom. pull race card.  seen thinking cases sole reason restrictions. really comes hispitlisations/deaths increasing massively cases go up. there's one thing know definite cwses go significantly hospitlisations deaths follow shortly. vaccines change that. Yh we'll always cases vaccines it'll hopefully significantly reduce pressure hospitlisations reduce deaths. point government see reason continue restrictions know economy struggling. wouldn’t surprise since US pushing Cold War aggression destabilize China. would funny backfired us terrible infrastructure Wow. Thank response. I'm going read article research free time later tonight. started eating cup super food smoothie every morning that's berries, kale, ginger root. Lost 5 pounds month change alone. feel incredible. eating typical American diet before.  Nice Eye roll False equivalency whataboutism currency de jour modern conservatives. restrictions magically go away soon want to, really matters Plot Twist: US working China study coronavirus mutations... bats... Wuhan.

I wish joke.

Yep, (USA) collaborated China, partially funding ""gain-of-function"" studies Wuhan Institute Virology. type research still considered controversial, halted 2014. 2017, started back up. make great decisions! (/s)

Here's Vox article related sources: google ""wuhan gain function"" news sources, like Vox.

I add, studying CoV mutations bats, also viruses animals. However.. strange, it? city lab running sketchy ""gain-of-function"" research CoV mutations bats also city outbreak/pandemic started (or say first reported). Shame there's evidence clue us in. likely cause. Keep mind, well, seeing outbreaks various illnesses like due deforestation. 

Animals types, including host zoonotic viruses, spend lot time forests/foliage-covered areas, either place chill out, place seek shelter, place find food. 

If get rid forests, eliminating cozy places animals mostly isolate humans. - choice things like chilling out, feeding, seeking shelter places humans are. 

This what's ""new"" becoming increasingly worrisome. 

***

If wet market, it'd village near area recent deforestation something along lines. 

And next one need start China. Look habitats destroyed. worse yet, gap next pandemic-worthy-virus likely smaller last one now. kid? Biontech one everyday. available live. wait summer pay own. got first dose got covid 3 weeks later. suffering two weeks. Freaks think would happened hadn’t vaccinated yet. Curious, long making wait 2nd dose? got initial Pfizer Vaccine Tuesday Feb 16th. scheduled 2nd March 16th. wife (which nurse practitioner) said giving 2nd dose 3 weeks away first. thinks call speak this.

Thanks advance. Exactly. Thank putting words. rightly so.

The risk people must vaccinated first, reduce death count reduce number hospitalizations.

It's gets protected first. fastest method bringing pandemic everyone. tja think people actually shunning AZ vaccine people opportunity get vaccinated. general public getting vaccinated today even month now. TBH I'll pretty surprised get vaccinated 2021... Well, hate sun. want warm enough exercise comfortably outside. sun f\*\*\* off. another report saying Pfizer think ultra-low deep freeze temperatures necessary things game changers. vaccine required one shot easy distribution would go twice fast easier distribution. phase 3 results 52% 1st dose. jump 85% real world   everyone vaccine would discouraged gathering indoors non-households?  soon hits 36 degrees I'm bustin' hope right! Since superhuman achievement neither alcoholic obese? keep clear drug food addiction 97.856% there. response AZ vaccine strange, wonder why. see Janssen reported lower efficacy.  take seriously. Either he's trolling incredibly misinformed. Right much zero sum game every vaccine given healthy young grocery store worker vaccine given 60+ year old way likely die.

If 60+ year old able stay home (because job allows work home retired), prioritized grocery store workers.

If 60+ year olds getting covid due choices lower priority workers choice. also look statistics (confidence interval), number.

That number based 2 cases vaccine group 21,669 people versus 27 cases 21,686 placebo group. 

That gives 95% confidence internal 69.0–98.3% efficacy. 

You would need much larger study pin exact efficacy (and different patient population would also change number). family went beach almost every weekend. However stay away anyone keep chance transmission way down. Ironically 3 year old would anyways want everyone around us disturbed Ugh...lockdowns fall/winter would really suck. I'd surprised, first time. took original virus many months moving cities (New York) non-urban states.

Vaccinations happen faster SF Bay Area too, closer 6ft others. Yes, would outlier, hope outliers still contract covid vaccination experience mild illness. That’s absolutely win. fined $19,000 irony’s sake. I've known 3 people got AZ jab (dad 60s, neighbour 30s immunosuppressants, nurse 40s). reported similar things feeling like absolute garbage 12 hours overnight, clearing completely that. Similar symptoms fever, headaches etc.

No reports second dose yet. point, block basically become reducer.

You can't spread COVID can't basically catch anywhere, that's works. Vaccinating people reduce transmission infections people say otherwise dangerous anti-maskers. [Taiwan CDC said they're getting batch vaccine doses February 4, Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) reported COVAX global vaccine-sharing initiative announced first COVID-19 vaccine distribution list. first round COVAX Facility's vaccine distribution includes 1,303,200 AstraZeneca vaccine doses allocated non-UN member states, including Taiwan non-UN member countries. World Health Organization (WHO) notify countries receive vaccine doses actual allotted amount delivery schedule issuing emergency use approval AstraZeneca vaccine. CECC stays touch COVAX arrange delivery, customs declaration, related matters concerning batch doses. expect lockdowns every fall winter rest lives?

If not, think they'll eventually stop, factors play coming fall? they're not, look subtotal line. Told daughter going get Fitbit Christmas; said would call unfitbit anything! TBH, think darkest moments I've since pandemic (other than, obviously, everything surrounding partner's death) past month I'm fully vaccinated still able leave house whenever I'm working, there's blizzard. Asymptomatic spreading less likely, sneezing coughing release virus environment. still possible, vaccine even spread next people infected also lower chance serious infection symptoms thus lower risk spreading it. Vaccine denial comments highly irresponsible continue perpetuate culture distrust fear medical expertise, especially black/brown people marginalized even killed result doctors’ racism. 

Fatalism doesn’t make smarter, makes people trust doctors, thus putting us right back started. seem like person know. Quick question, people speak doses refer rounds? Reworded: 200m doses 200 million people 100 million people getting shots? legit telling think we'll ever normal concerts Broadway shows again? feel bad you.

Edit: would cases increase winter everyone vaccinated? I'm US, husband Israeli, baby 2019 able visit husband's family Israel meet baby. 

I mean, even wanted travel risk health (which do), Israeli halted flights several times covid cases control. They're better vaccine rollout might well wait vaccines ourselves. would inane comment someone's weekend plans quickly upvoted? Without politics injected nation's arm hundreds thousands people might died. Fauci praised work pandemic? lied misinformed public multiple times reason everyone still loves him? post subreddits. doesn’t go that’s all. want keep opinions reactions first person accounts biased sources. Give break. one going that. Stay home long takes feel safe. live level risk tolerance. think mean 1.299 billion go “Pfizer CEO: Expect double number doses shipped U.S. avg 5M doses per week starting next couple weeks.

Pfizer track provide 120M doses US end March 200M doses released end May, 2 months ahead original Fosun private company. distribute China either. Chinese government bought Fosun distribute it. like US government bought Pfizer distribute it.

The story even richer. Lin Chuan, who's former head administration arm Taiwan government, successfully secured 10mm doses Fosun Taiwan last year, current ruling party Taiwan anti-China accept anything China, order got cancelled. Later Taiwan government wanted deal BioNTech directly told Fosun exclusive deal greater China region. That's meant effort ""blocked"", fact cancelled order earlier refused buy Fosun even today. I'm saying people reading exact numbers. there's huge difference 60% (it actually 52.4%) 92%. think research effectiveness variants separately. real brrakdown much pfizer/AZ UK using Scotland covid tradker breakdown vaccines administered. 
In Scotland atleast jist 50% pfizer far. probably similar whole UK. probably change jn coming weeks get vaccines Um, zero risk tolerance. know possible, kids make 25% US population. people talk getting heard immunity, going get without vaccinating kids. advocating locked forever. want guidance feel like blasé everything. Oh definitely able to. talking restrictions is. entire region US little restrictions months. never said prevents transmission. Don’t put fucking words mouth.

The point I’m making tell people (who mostly stupid) this, they’ll assume “doesn’t work” won’t get vaccinated. daily case numbers decline. appreciate they’re badly porn

If vaccine-resistant strain COVID produced, would *definitely* cause deaths delaying vaccinations lower-risk younger people weeks. vaccinating people hastily AZ vaccine means UK population ends immunity adenovirus vector used, time South African strain arrive quick path producing booster shot help, *definitely* lead people dying. 

Both situations plausible proposed well-qualified scientists. These, concerns, underpin UK doctors association’s strenuous objections political decision unilaterally change dosage regimens.

There hard data support UK decision time made - thats simply fact. merely limited data clinical 2 dose regimen studies period dose 1 2 - covering single week full efficacy, case Pfizer vaccine. know decades experience different vaccines behave differently, one vaccines question *entirely new vaccine platform*.

I really understand desire *just something, anything* reopen British economy. many times aggressive move attempted without supporting data past, even well intentioned, lives lost medical disasters occurred. Pandemrix Thalidomide two concrete examples UK’s lack rigor relative nations caused mortality. It’s unfortunate lesson lost lives still doesn’t seem learned. understand Fauci saying Christmas, even back normal, ""safely reopened"" masks. Obviously make policy inconsistent messaging public health experts confusing. Though better saying masked Christmas. Ummm, vaccines tested kids yet, less likely severely effected Covid severely effected flu.  idea, honest. somebody made ton money freezers basically useless. close. walked back drinking bleach. accept rest context fact wrong. No, specifically remember reading studies concluding covid produced higher *rates* long-term effects, absolute numbers mention it. realized sub existed since 2013. thought created specifically virus CDC recommendation. Pretty sure usually wears N95 cloth one top looks. Like bringing home flowers apology argument :D It’s good, it’s true deluge horrible news stories it’s hard see light sometimes. However, may necessarily done you. 3 things back nothing else matters lol. everything else right now. think first time seen anything stating pumping fast (what took it). might miss news Twitter Reddit, remember vaccine companies saying prioritizing vaccine. wrong wrong, remember. hope focusing vaccine much possible help get ""back normal"" highly doubt drug manufacturer refrigerator business. guess it’s possible, I’m pretty sure don’t. suggest post first Coronas respective areas opened wonder things change people Canada see US getting back normal still lockdown. Conceivably, could lead ton pressure open up.  good point, NY Times article making sound like able get plane see grandma without proof vaccination everyone. remain hopeful. feel strange cautious adults protected go whole hog. Like, care kiddo want ignore risk. (Which yes, smaller, still feels strange). Yeah, gonna gradual thing. I've always thought look like Nike swoosh V. Per capita lower US, UK many countries Europe. Yes, nobody allowed live freer live unless everyone can. causes sales drop 1% doesn’t matter. Increasing prices doesn’t always mean higher revenue Vaccine rollout rollercoaster: state fix future problems? state Utah, looks like end May all. So, 43, you’ll likely April! depends government responds. delay second dose, could back normal couple months sooner. I'd rather catch virus ever get jabbed vaccine made China. OK, let rephrase: expect restrictions every fall winter rest lives? not, think they'll eventually stop, factors play coming fall? Thank explaining it. shit happen vacuum. grocery stores going magically leave population starve. 

If 1 leaves, competitor gets additional business. still demand, another store come along. 

Isn't magical free market work? I'm gonna send extra toilet paper N95 masks kid's college dorm room ""just case, love sweetie"" note like grandma hid $20 bills potted plants depression. do. unreasonable context. study stated suggest possibility ecological fallacy limitations. example, besides seasonality cause temp changes, could rain significant period forcing people indoor circumstances, context apparent study. 

It's interesting see results though another data point. Every activity carries risk, risk pretty low April since cases vaccination rates up. might even vaccinated then. That’s incivility. It’s literal fact anti-vaxxers scum put public health risk. Biontech mRNA technology cancer treatment many years. carrier technology same. seems prudent me, know vaccines impact herd immunity reading. I'm surprised high person. There’s also lot false institutional professional knowledge saying RNA horribly unstable molecule inherently transient, must kept low temperatures disappear look wrong.

It’s actually quite stable…if keep free nucleases (which historically colossal laboratory environments), it’s generally friendly work purified protein chemically fall apart monomers bit faster (days room temp rather weeks), also less prone catastrophically losing solubility. agree severe consequences. disagree restrictions ruined millions people's future. think ok disagree, yeah multiple sides argument.

Restaurants specifically impacted regardless restrictions. state restrictions. bar news last month 1000 people it. Despite lax restrictions, restaurants still shutting temporarily permanently even though dine in, people know safe so. 

I think would agree rather blindly giving PPP loans whatever business apply (I personally know multiple small/medium business owners got money despite better years pandemic, anyone read news businesses simply receiving money existing) taking better care restaurant owners employees.  BioNtech said beginning eventually product stored common less demanding storage temperatures optimise formula.

Sure, hardly refer current vaccine. Changing formula would require new approval. 

Anyways, since CureVac testing mRNA vaccine stored normal fridge temperature, always clear 2nd generation mRNA vaccines require low temperatures.  pretty outdated. English evolved use ‘data’ singular. one talks ‘datum’. That's basically gist it. One neighbors walked house months back, got Costco Instacart order. Proceeded question shopping methods (I work home always have, cheaper/more profitable someone pick up) grill ridicule wiping kids applesauce pouch boxes dried mango strips Clorox wipe. 

It ended asked knew kids risk factors he'd help carry casket came time. 

A lot people externalizing insecurities. wipe groceries take 2 minutes know really bothers neighbor. Lockdowns made worse, though. absolutely right. I've calling ""shadow pandemic"" mental health. acute crisis subsided, shadow crisis become obvious people.

I feel similar you. hope take care let logical side gently nudge towards normal schedule.

I liken bungee jumping.... totally *logically* convinced legs secured cord everything order, point push take (in case literal) leap faith. “Halloween travel” lol! Pretty certain pandemic playbook called mask wearing social settings people showing signs sickness ever called indefinite school closures. Yep. Europeans obsessed lockdowns (not helps compared America) enough vaccines yet. I'm so, thankful live US one bothered serious lockdown April 2020. live (N IL) produce overall expensive prepared food. goes bad quickly, understand poorer people stocking fresh fruit veggies. Hell, grew poorer household, ate *lot* pasta, rice, PBJ sandwiches. foods make puff like nobody's business. past months, I’ve helped create vaccination tracker website (www.vaccineprogress.info) classmates shows close nation achieving herd immunity, accounting natural vaccinated immunity. view progress vaccine rollout across states nationally. We’ve worked Stanford professors epidemiology public health ensure accuracy. works directly CDC data (more info section site).

We made website super simple load extremely quickly, showing relevant info -- especially much-needed approximations close herd immunity. think site offers great resource public keep tabs vaccination progress keep elected officials accountable.

Thanks, hope website useful you!

Anecdotal reports forum aren’t evidence Taiwan part China Fosun can't distribute there.

They've handled China origin coronavirus better anyone else. get COVID already? yes, they're safe meet with. changing, recently data prevents transmission. lot unions said return vaccinated. Long Beach, CA. aggressive discourage local governments. vaccine seat belt, would recommend half population wear one 95% effective, everyone wear one almost certainly 85% effective first six weeks, replace update needed? ""No, I'm feeling warm spot"" \~Mr.Krabs  Look downvoted. They're sad.

Taiwan part China rest world hopes never be.

The gulf living standards, pollution, manners democratic government two vast.

The thing downvotes probably coming Chinese live abroad stunningly inadequate, much want CCP world power.

Then think they'll feel superior. world hates CCP supporters matter colour skin. That's lot fewer precautions concerned people might take, good reasonable. excellent point. even data whether long-term adverse effects two doses one. Nobody saying rules spread fear vaccine (needless say completely pro-vax.) Thinking helps put context fact vaccines used EUA basis, *emergency lots people dying every day.* 

If vaccine seat belt, would suggest half population wear one 95% effective, everyone wear one 90% effective first three months use, update needed? That’s fair - I’d say situation depressing, better? Overall I’m actually feeling really good happy, loving family ever! “Holiday Travel” line always bullshit. Viruses ebb flow weather, cases *TRIPLE* two weeks Thanksgiving. Halloween travel? Give break. 

This guy probably right, virus running people infect, case numbers *worse* adherence 3 months ago. politician scientist dumb enough say 0.1% chance they’re wrong “new variant” (they’re months old) causes reinfection another spike, optimistic person get crucified. 

It’s everyone’s best interest say: “end summer, fall, 2022” anyone looking objectively knows much sooner. easy feel like downvotes matter, enough people pile comment, automatically hidden pushed bottom thread.

When people use downvote button solely disagree somebody saying, starts weave narrative. group people sub want voices people still worried covid heard. somebody says something benign ""why unconcerned new variants"" immediately goes -14, something wrong.

I care downvotes specifically, I'm asking people stop trying silence voices disagree with. [WHO - Median IFR across global locations - Global death count Times quoting India's health minister 56% seroprevalance “Mutations variant make difficult detect least one WHO-recommended PCR tests. discovery could significant impact determining spread disease,"" laboratory said. semi-reasonable assume federal leadership strong, consistent messaging masks (and actually wore them), might reached high peaks infection. ""Diabetes runs family nobody runs family"" someone usually votes Dems, agree. Fuck guy don’t understand argument cost bell peppers berries. Yes, produce expensive. Grapes, berries, bell peppers, “exotic” fruits, almost always expensive. produce dirt cheap healthy. Potatoes, sweet potatoes, cabbage, apples, oranges, bananas, carrots, broccoli, lemons, limes, cucumbers, radishes, beans, rice, healthy foods incredibly cheap buy regularly staples kid eat. buy expensive items too, usually one two items per grocery trip switch things up. Anyone blaming obesity cost expensive produce ridiculous. can’t live bell peppers. Likely closer 600,000.

All said, US 140,000 ""Deaths Expected"" non COVID19 related medical fatalities. vaccine dose make current COVID-19 infection worse? someone mild case asymptomatic, could vaccine potentially worsen infection-in-progress? Students need go another college. That’s pretty messed up, Chico State trying pull. Hit hurts, pocketbooks. I'm overweight, otherwise healthy, late 30s. mom (now vaccinated) wants go beach summer. chances vaccinated August? I'm US.

Second, would safe small kids? vaccinated yet, exposure beach seems unlikely. predictions covid numbers like then?

Many thanks. 5 times many deaths entire continent Africa.

`500 / 328200 = 0.15%`

`100 / 1216000 = `0.0082%`

`0.15 / 0.0082 = 18.5`

You're 18.5 times likely die Covid-19 USA Africa. 95% efficacy preventing infection getting symptoms enough wanking cycle Yea. Sure coincidence. Thank you. certainly understand need done, efforts reopen schools first include best protection give children. Technically true United States unfortunately. also shit constitutional right United States. hate guy data show, data shows.

Data plural! Brainwashing hell drug. majority adults vaccinated protect children. Vaccinations cut infections transmission, concrete proof now. Want protect kids? Get vaccinated encourage others community same! already started reporting less. released data today. Antibody response double group waited 12 weeks doses compared 6 weeks. Vaccine efficacy also rose 55% guess could argue worried vaccine make feel probably feel even worse actually got covid. think people tend focus much cases someone gets covid hardly symptoms forget lot time probably going give similar nasty effects people fear vaccine. Op-Ed’s aren’t allowed, article Op-Ed’s allowed? It’s circumventing rules. Yea I'm wearing masks second shot, I'm done That's bananas.

I admit hardcore distancer. work home, go anywhere. Masks worn properly (cloth n95) go anywhere. 

I healthy relatively young vaxxed public health numbers indicate measures relaxed dropped going without mask shit like normal.

I would say.. would nice people sick cold, flu, coronaviruses, consumption would stay home sick. must go out, wear mask. Would maybe one positive takeaway this. transcript:

Trump: Thank much. asked Bill question probably thinking of, you’re totally world, find interesting. So, supposing hit body tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet powerful light — think said hasn’t checked, you’re going test it. said, supposing brought light inside body, either skin way, think said you’re going test too. sounds interesting.

Acting Secretary Bryan: We’ll get right folks could.

Trump: Right. see disinfectant, knocks minute. One minute. way something like that, injection inside almost cleaning. see gets lungs tremendous number lungs. would interesting check that. So, that, you’re going use medical doctors with. sounds — sounds interesting me. we’ll see. whole concept light, way kills one minute, that’s — that’s pretty powerful.

The context talking light. mention drinking things bleach. hallucinating. could raised prices 1%? Weird decision easily accessible (no special fridges required) one shot, vaccine plan getting. sounds like heavy-duty double-shot vaccines allocated people vulnerable find test population though? realize order would need someone   receive one dose, possible risk gaining immunity subsequently getting infected and/or ill.

Well... Half participate trials get vaccine get two doses version know vaccine effective. That's whole point trials... that’s case, keep masks social distancing, 20-30% person classes majority still online ridiculous. There’s good reasoning that. Especially professors getting second vaccine next month students opportunity get vaccinated next fall.

We students. paying thousands right half ass education unfortunately everyone afford opportunity, take gap semester/year transfer. know can’t first generation college student multiple scholarships can’t maintain don’t enroll semester. education format long term solution something students signed for. was, students would taking classes online institutions. Chico State announcing “plans” early beyond really hope change that’s unacceptable. people commenting even read second half article explaining even ""normal"" summer pandemic over.

Never understood argument, countries start ease restrictions situation actually concretely improved? that's case, basically saying governments SK NZ idea they're doing.

So, people might still wear masks grocery store, cares? People Wuhan still wear masks, travel, go nightclubs, movies, go see friends family without guilt on. still outbreaks China? Yes, life go that, life adapt. China adapted putting systems place deal future outbreaks used multiple times since Wuhan outbreak, incidents practically flashes proverbial pan. Places like China East Asian countries understood allow people small, everyday freedoms--small gatherings, low-capacity dining--and center mitigation around making things possible--public masking, quarantine facilities, proactive testing--you recipe long-term management vaccines arrive. depressing Americans understand long-term crisis planning. think change next fall winter would suddenly safer January 2022? Every student teacher willing vaccinated done end summer.  amount money makes chickens lay eggs faster, buy chickens. Sure, long goggles completely seal. suggesting people others mask free? ridiculous. Go want do. one stopping you...or they... Vaccine rollout effects? Antibody studies almost certainly underestimate natural immunity. Antibody testing doesn’t capture antigen-specific T-cells, develop “memory” activated virus. 

Researchers Sweden’s Karolinska Institute found percentage people mounting T-cell response mild asymptomatic Covid-19 infection consistently exceeded percentage detectable antibodies. T-cell immunity even present people exposed infected family members never developed symptoms. group U.K. scientists September pointed medical community may under-appreciating prevalence immunity activated T-cells. Welcome reality pandemics Covid-19. I’ve saying bed wetters year Exactly. 25 year old doesn’t deserve deal long covid 40+ years they’re got vaccinated late grandma extra 5% vaccine efficacy. work grocery store worker. confirm! Haha guess kissing asses calling us “essential” thanking us, back “average joes” I’m saying able get along, less likely. That’s better immune system response stop virus bits weak immune system require less virus get infected. infectious variant means even child’s strong immune system prevent infections. inbox blowing BIG MAD responses every time comment remote schooling bad family hope continue least teachers district vaccinated, preferably kids well.

""OMG WANT RUIN MENTAL HEALTH ENTIRE GENERATION. KIDS EVEN GET SICK SPREAD MAKING PERSONALLY SUFFER WANTING REMOTE OPTIONS CONTINUE SHORT TERM PANDEMIC FINALLY STARTING WIND DOWN.""

Like somehow preferences negatively affecting all. never, ever say remote great even possible everyone available option laser focused ""YOU TRYING REDUCE FAMILY'S RISK MAKING MAD"" response bewildering. Just...why? I'm hurting anyone telling anyone else do.

Having positive remote schooling experience apparently allowed? Yes, studies like possible, flawed,, link gave earlier study found efficacy 52%, study cited comment responded to, studies came last days. Certainly Israeli study found efficacy 83%, read that.

I understand studies done like said, apply recent one's. I'm willing proven wrong, give actual study, explanation concept. read comment miss part alone? Tell feel dying alone hospital one beig able see you. news, think longer considered order inappropriate discuss return normalcy soon. Ever since pandemic began, mentioning terms ""back normal"" completely verboten automatically lumps category anti mask Karens. 

Sociak distancing necessarily trip Disneyland people, especially vaccine vaccineS. pretending stimulus packages going enormous impact future? ""lost decade"" look like US? price US inflate way debt? many people never able retire now? expensive commodities become? cost society cutting 12 years education 11? many people mental health issues?

Let's pretend serious long term implications this. Perhaps restrictions ""least bad"" outcome could expect. might been, certainly repercussions every American's life decades. That's true, EU benefit data come Israel US. decision US makes point probably come late help rollout much. would totally sign that. 

I'd much rather get covid antibodies quarentine done, instead worry infecting others. variants projected vaccine uptake think summer likely fall question point  would obviously get covid. It’s worth living like slow spread moderately severe respiratory virus. die, oh well, gonna die someday anyway. that’s extremely unlikely vast majority people get covid fine. do. must mod shift nothing would happen previously. US view learning experience start long process becoming less dependent China, won’t.

Exactly, applies EU. Shouldn’t fat then. Health providers saying years kills you. Yeah, actually really good point right here. get lot questions people seeing exactly point -- public health messaging vaccines AWFUL really bad distinguishing ""well-supported fact"" ""probably, want data."" Don’t know you’re getting downvoted. mentioned New England Journal Medicine article published two days ago.

The flipside time doses may increase duration immunity. Even nobody dies, still big dick move. Nobody likes sick getting people hospitals help us... Oh my. link shared earlier; one we’ve discussing past  developed chronic acid reflux worse anxiety since damn pandemic started I'm quite bit anti-social shut even gotten much me. used love going thrifting, checking arcades, playing pinball/minigolf, going movies going roadtrips (most myself). quite literally done things year starting look like I'm going next year well :( graphs? graphs [Canadian government don’t show this. worse crimes humanity committed besides publishing book. fair. research articles content ok, organisation, structure exams awful. Hope get bro. too, got second dose today feel guilty fuck! I'd get covid, I'm healthy. 

 asked mom getting covid lockdown, I'd want lockdown (although ""lockdown"" state reduced capacity masks) Thanks, Merkel. safe assume fiance year either? argument really hold water all. physiologically implausible, single quantitative analysis support context alternative. actually arguable total selection pressure enormously reduced doubling rate vaccination.

What happen ""weak immunity"" everyone gets vaccine year, next year? could considerable cohort. reason vaccinate many people possible right now? think so.

Because ""weak immunity,"" excellent immunity standard great many existing vaccines. certainly weaker native immune response unvaccinated person, already triggers host variants, passes successful great numbers another unvaccinated person.

And weaker weak immunity someone already another variant year ago, remains unprotected booster effect even first dose would offer. That's huge cohort people US.

It's weaker weak immunity someone gotten first dose, period first two weeks dose, immunity demonstrably weak.

I get argument all, I'm hoping someone come back real thing. Cool, don’t get vaccine then. knowledge 95% pretty damn amazing - people understand either! He’s right tho data available right 1 dose injection right front commentaries. compiled Quebec immunologists.

There compelling data 1 dose provides approximately 80% efficacy among elders mobidity factors (80% vaccinated, 33 331 40 000) healthcare workers (approximately 50% vaccinated, 172 979 320 000) reduced number deaths among elders Quebec.

Source (in French): Pfizer recommend delaying dose: even threatened withdrawn Covid-19 vaccine doses federal government Quebec follow protocol. actually overwhelmed sources saying Indian hospitals full corona patients turning patients away

Those articles mostly reports one city 2 time periods spanning couple days each, one June around September. articles foreign websites local Indian media. media free report whatever want. 

India one city generalising one city's situation rest country absolutely incorrect. 

And situation part decent apart 2 time periods. know this? actually live city get treated stomach infection December. 

There absolutely evidence suggest massive nationwide underreporting deaths. Maid cook, former hailing poor state Uttar Pradesh latter hailing Jharkhand received news massive deaths across villages. 

Between experiences telling something foreigner claiming contrary, would believe experiences. Eric Fiegl-Ding banned Twitter yet?

His tweets borderline propaganda point, apparent distain Ron DeSantis entire State Texas getting rather bizarre even incendiary. cringeworthy best dangerous worst. ‘I’m job applied signed for’ What’s funny study quote article quoted CNN another article sub, claims Pfizer Moderna vaccines work fine SA variant. agree first 2 paragraphs there’s need go armchair psychologist okay people's families getting infected, staying home nearly time. wearing mask every time go carrying around sanitizer. taking careful precautions visiting family friends, even though one friend begged see months now. Nice try. yeah. clue, think properly.. part Bloomberg article supports constrained months? impression 100% eligible people 16+ actually want vaccinated something? mid-April likely total doses total demand unless hesitancy goes down. 

And speaking that, don’t understand assumptions hesitancy. all. starting faulty assumption vaccine hesitancy based logical thinking. True that, pushback newly declared goal 35 incidence came nowhere.

Except Laschet. Also alot pushback barbers open cause nobody explained barbers open again. That’s messed up. would different anyone taking precautions pushed others. mostly never see all. Exactly. None health officials TV talking it.
Sure can't turn around problems night US health official job promote healthy lifestyle, say ""mask continue eating fast food 7 days week"". 
OK, direct quote federal state levels putting weekly home exercise ideas. healthy grocery store recipe options.
You start somewhere. don’t need massive investment mental health, need media political leaders correct messaging sideline doomsayers. secret data suggesting MHRA access public access to? Pfizer fully published study results, best knowledge.

It’s notable MHRA regulator entire world made decision, manufacturer advice. perhaps better question UK came different conclusion every regulatory body worldwide? means 15% inefficiency safety issues Don’t worry I’m sure teacher’s unions throw b.itch fit still find excuses go back work. Kids youth far worst victims pandemic. least developmentally. amount sociological, psychological emotional damage that’s accrued last long time. would fucking dumb bunch poorer counties base approvals FDA (or MHRA EMA) vaccinations finished october. Ok instead taking second dose 3 weeks, take 6 months? next season? could vaccinate twice many people.  defense. Nothing changes me, besides lowering anxiety. I'll still wear PPE advocate people get vaccine. small sense guilt/anxiety attached Oxford jab, still okay now. No, personally running around licking door handles booking holidays. stooping level unsubstantiated conspiracies run unsubstantiated conspiracies expense. Good God, hope so. thing I've past year one mild cold, usually I'm sick month winter lingering cough. attribute everyone would usually hacking around wearing mask kids son's daycare wearing masks. would love become ubiquitous Oct-Mar. old kids?

They starting trials children now. 4-12 months away depending live. Anxiety covid anything easily raise HR 90 actually said March people thought insane. think states giving pessimistic estimates feds lived distribution promises haven’t given long term schedules they’re projections. suspect time goes fees/manufacturers actually ramp state projections start become optimistic. theory Lol buggin certainly approached much emphasis vs pre existing plans though: chapter 3 look what’s going UK. Better yet, read entire thing. Page 38 39 good too. Yes, mainly pandemic flu plan, says also apply viruses. went rails actual pandemic plans, made without time pressure, likely less political pressure public pressure well. There’s reason you’re investing instance, make personal statement look market crashing. People change plan crash typically lose money.  Yankees fans lol. Exactly acting like 50/50 chance one dose useless.

We idea chance was. That's point. making decision little evidence either mathematical standpoint two dose vaccine let’s say 90% effective, long one dose gives 45% effectiveness still get “immunity” population.

From science standpoint, that's vaccine immunity works"
