0,2021-02-02," people ones trying virtue signal social media Great news... also let countries like Mexico know able fill order timeframe. get inject specific people phase 3 though. Vaccinations actually present opportunity mutations. Right reason Covid select strains vaccine resistant. vaccinations become common, reward vaccine resistant strains. Hopefully mildly vaccine resistant get sniffles, vaccine rollout would cause vaccine resistance evolve. think lockdowns occurred? covid spread control well maintained people wearing masks social distancing? Sputnik vaccine widely available? feels like wahoo another good vaccine available May. US vaccines made US. nothing Pfizer vaccines made EU.   think time? We've already done significant damage kids every day keep classrooms more. Keep mind health experts around world saying closing schools harm good. Canadian whose dose timelines slashed really pulling USA get loan/sell us leftovers Wish could get one. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

It’s ideal it’s way back.  

In district teachers back kids masked distanced staggered days. Community transmission student teacher seems like it’s happening. 

Some Teachers hand hanging out, outside school multiple teacher outbreaks way.  

Sports memorable spread students.

I say 67yo mom teaches 3-4 year olds person. put together protocol her.  school parents great key think. Good!  pissed right now! SEE COMING!!! 

Now government talking talking appropriate stakeholders order form agreement discussions take place informing concerned players deep profound concern Canada finding solution. 

Ok then, let's build facility Montreal! wait, late time opens. use candidate vaccines? Well, ready around.... fall? another one 2022-2023. Great... Good job current government. always reacting actually thinking forward beyond me. Exactly first thought was. you!!!!!!!!!!

JK. bungled federal response. that's means. vaccines 100% effective currently circulating variant stopping hospitalization death. FWIW, it’s E484K mutation, one found P1 (Brazil) variant B1.351 (South Africa) variant, offers degree immune escape. far UK found 15 samples lately around 200k samples sequenced. exactly There, there. We're gonna let get away thermonuclear plot.  Vaccines cause herd immunity. natural infection, we’ve 35% US infected Covid already, halfway herd immunity hard way. Luckily vaccines take us half way, provide boosters future needed. read, take it’s worth, pfizer technically exclusive right production however letting companies get license produce royalty free pandemic over. confrontation many countries companies want released patent completely produced like generic, pfizer supposedly willing grant temporary authorization make must done standards 100% book procedures, don’t want countries companies produce subpar standards issue arises vaccines damming reputation pfizer vaccine.

this may total bullshit i’m trumpeting truth basic gist read comes conflict patent rights.

my guess US government hasn’t enacted production act national vaccine supply simply would take much time take factory US producing something else factory produce pfizer moderna (6 months would guess), due highly specialized production system would needed this, figure time companies produced adequate supply country therefore worth it. point completely conjecture could 1000% wrong one best guesses wondering myself. ...this week. around 79K doses Pfizer, believe, since we’ve hit pretty hard plant slowdown. going explain tiger king appear lacking basic reading comprehension, say definitely originate UK, even *this specific strain* likely didn't. explained know certainty particular strain originates explained would expect UK discover far country.

""We know"" acceptable answer here.

Anyone claiming know one way certainty lying mistaken. tell stop considering past? get 20th century? Like...the current educational system? 

And talked butt, think that’s weird. Stay well! like way pretty much fucking students half ass education they're offering online right ? rewear disposable ones, that’s healthcare people beginning decision made put gyms, restaurants, bars children long time ago. needed months ago, live consequences now. We, society, _chose_ worst worlds. hope it’s nothing like trump Republican party promising new affordable health care... I’m still waiting four years nothing he's relaying relevant information we're loop. stark difference we've getting. know people go insanely crowded bars clubs every single weekend still caught it. likely good. remember reading study somewhere saying big majority cases mainly spread work home. Oh fuck thinking America produced vaccine. literally made small company entirely Germany. brewed Belgium. sure great science. Firstly, vaccines sterilizing. Secondly, realistic case eliminating Covid earth, 20 years. Thirdly, mutations selected virus (or living thing) needs adapt successful, great way force new mutations restrict access new territory. Vaccines wonderful, widespread usage vaccines exactly would help select vaccine resistant strains become common. crash satellite Manitowoc, Wisconsin like it’s big deal ofcourse would know better right ? don’t think Bloomberg first saw post. case Pfizer ""who paid more"", much purchase order.

Pfizer (in EU USA) soon Sanofi pharmaceutical companies manufacture it. I'm Italian aunt healthcare worker private clinic. initially refused vaccine employer literally told 'okay fired', take it. Legally employers require vaccination precisely liability might face, especially healthcare institutions. 

Most hospitals public though, think complicated. Nevertheless, think aunt's boss right thing. works mainly vulnerable people (very old and/or disabled) really selfish refuse vaccine. don't. good idea abstain alcohol getting vaccine, alcohol lowers immune response. begs question: considering study supporting hasn’t still peer reviewed, original decision based good data, one else access to, including EMA, hunch? everything that’s Russian named Sputnik? Yeah wth, diverting doses south? Like really can't get portion em? jeeeze gotta quit comparing current situation past calamities. may Unicef warned closure classes irreversible impacts development students mental fallout overwhelming. already seeing impacts, families leave jobs order accommodate online schooling skyrocketing sucides, one school district United States already reported atleast 19. quit pulling info ass get head 20th century. Standards quality life since changed dramatically shock brought lockdowns school closures serious. Science media always conflict. Especially science conflicts $.

a supposition proposed explanation made basis limited evidence starting point investigation. Yeah Okay, well anyway normal people already getting continue Nah, lives civilized country. family pay anything. Seriously. wish would stop making random statements masks. he's fear mongering shifting goalposts. Check 22 days 76% protection. Bullshit, effectiveness rated who? Russia? personally invested specific vaccine? cause sound personally invested. EU 100% nationalistic.

How EU 100% nationalistic exporting vaccines around world since December, including UK?

On way, please tell many countries receiving vaccines point going put good Friday agreement danger reckless acts blocking vaccines Northern Ireland, stopped managed quite accomplishment getting British Irish governments, parties Northern Ireland come heavily them.

Ah attempt try stop potential fraud breach contract pharmaceutical company could diverging stock different country = 100% nationalistic EU never relying UK vaccines point, UK production vaccines start pandemic. 

No, EU relying pharmaceutical company stated contract part European vaccines would produced 2 plants UK, 2 EU would OK say point, ok EU make vaccines EU, making threats cut supply allowing companies sell vaccine slots UK, Canada, Australia others really on.

Oh would now, 100% nationalistic fine now? Make mind UK plants production problems, supposed get 10s millions doses last year, signed deals months earlier able sort out. EU could done messed much.

Every pharmaceutical company production problems, countries hoarding local production - USA UK. Else split production plants fulfill orders, UK allow vaccines made UK go anywhere else.

But please explain come Astrazaneca problems EU plants means ""EU messed much"", problem UK ""UK messed much""?

It's like diverging production problems pharmaceutical company trade block countries. EU bought vaccines, job pharmaceutical company deliver vaccines. real problem pharmaceutical company making vaccines country 100% nationalistic - UK - that's hoarding stock made UK. European Parliament: fast..... want abandon another 4 months education convenience? 80 school days lot, especially already neglecting kids past 11 months. fat, already likely die heart disease. weight problem ffs. serious post need change &amp; now. Get house. Gee thanks. probably fine man, prob unsafe part, fun least? also likely variant originate there. thinking way ""How reason UK origin"". tried think otherwise? should. Honestly, article horrible reporting. much space dedicated irrelevant topic perceived campaign ""gaff"" burying relevant point: Two weeks ago, Yang announced quarantining potentially exposed Covid-19 campaign staffer. 

What's interesting Andrew tested negative recently past weekend (a days ago), longer needed quarantine back trail. likely case took 2 weeks exposure started experiencing symptoms tested positive. course also possible simply exposed coming quarantine quick incubation period... get it, much unproven. one, taking stircter measures even effect death rates. Also, remember viruses also mutate weaker variants too, meaning less deaths. Yet never spoken (or least almost all) public schools NY state closed.

This even close true. school districts open person extent. ince September.  really bright are. Brain damage, must have.   pedantic. clarified meant, want right, I'll tell right makes feel better.  might fine flu vaccine also meant prevent spread virus protect people don’t luxury fine it. COVID. Efficiency definitely matters.  Netherlands tracks variants separately. B117 variant consistently growing variants shrink

It hard square “not transmissible” hypothesis turn TV, dude. Don’t entrust mental health cable news networks.  Canada anytime soon. going go good old lockdown method prevention long time. Okay makes feel better. like plague inc. Don’t get wrong, person went school policy effect agree terrible, doesn’t account boomers Gen-xers fell Q shit. adults long W’s administration. Yeah, world last year. That's pedantic all. people named, along people named, *100 million people*.

That's one almost three Americans. That's plenty ""normal"". negative fallout? loss generation? 

Kids survived wars natural disasters. Schools daycares arbitrary system benchmarks standards created hundreds years ago. 

We global pandemic. students failing, it’s failing reconstructing educational system works generation. mean indoor dining open clearly “the science” says it’s okay. closed means “the science” says it’s bad. governments always follow science data immune politics hysteria. Yay ambiguous language fear mongering Fauci. hope becomes extremely irrelevant coming months I’m going laugh bitterly hubris subreddit turns right. know people despondent point suicidal idea virus, I’m trying respectful that, hating getting angry Osterholm honest concerns really immature. man deserves respect - he’s trying help country, hurt personally. 

I don’t understand people can’t admit “we don’t know”, “we’ll wait see”. meantime, I’m hoping best mentally preparing worst. shouldn’t burden Pandemic info back able function somewhat normally again. Can’t imagine frustrating would someone told past year understand mostly can’t get mouth vocal chords work properly ask questions. better chances playing Russian roulette 50/50 vaccine. CTU's positions would teachers returning 2022. political theater best. teachers would commit returning classrooms without fight getting vaccinated city would probably board, made clear would still resist return classrooms even that. Ah it’s OK wait long everyone else gets move on. GD selfishness myopia shocking korabl, means 'ship' russian.  That's one hypothesis seems logical. However, (non-vector based) vaccines, longer period doses often translates better long lasting protection anyway. love see it! Thankful Japan leading way reopening need pedantic it. means normal categories high risk, front line workers, first responders educators. provided image detail, sure else want.  would need test US? Americans respond vaccine differently russians. misunderstanding source then? multiple vaccines start showing though... First doses.

Passed total doses yesterday. don’t understand downvoted.  I’m 39, super careful, looking forward vaccination know even pretty great chance weathering Covid well thing I’m least interested losing taste smell (or getting phantom smoky smells) extended period time careful.  could see vaccinated happen told “well wasn’t severe case”.

My friend’s husband hasn’t tasted things correctly since March answers improve.  Eff that.  vaccine likely reduce risk stupid annoying ancillary stuff Covid well prevent severe disease? depends state, age categories, vaccine availability, priority lists.

But yes, age, eligible soon.   include loss happy life years we're already higher loss life virus could ever inflict. never tried go way ""saving"" people sacrificing more. Yeah, no. I'm 11 months crisis. Fuck right two masks. *(slow clap)* is. least far virus itself, obviously can’t officially speak vaccine durability there’s data. coronaviruses rna transcription error correction process influenza not, leads slower mutation. Hypothetically means shouldn’t need updated quite frequently influenza. Remember, pandemic right now, means lot hosts thus potential mutation vectors would see post-vaccine world seen yet, want one see edited comment. No, things ""shut down"" every new variant. *We need reduce spread vaccinating population...*

I keep saying thing, like ignoring I'm providing answer question me. I'm saying need nation-wide shelter-in-place order; need **wear masks socially distance.** really hard do.

We'll much better place least months really ramping vaccinations. one asking change, understand people given everything random sickly grandpas COPD young adults getting screwed much. one wants change also: random people's fault old person probably wipes eyes grocery store gets COVID dies. saw time job. locking taking better precautions due risk. essential worker live crowded dorm partiers can't really control anything. can't expect everyone live miserably forever everyone 100% safe. OBVIOUSLY, wait vaccination things go south might accept it. Stay inside bunker  got mine. hope return normal soon. certainly lot ""unlucky"" Coronavirus, many ways, ""lucky"" susceptible one type vaccine multiple modalities. And, spreads easily, mortality *that* bad. harm majority kids.

All say, could *lot* worse. Hopefully raise political invest preventing future pandemics. September, might reach herd immunity without vaccinations. never mention fact probably 1/3 country already exposed? 70 85 percent Americans vaccinated, say? I'll take things never happen $800, Alex.

We're going back normal society entity feels though appropriate so. CNN tells us ""safe."" go kick rocks. One vaccine every vaccine.

Slowing spread stopping spread.

Sincerely,

A doomsayer. Ok, maybe I'm misunderstanding situation dad. concerned retirement poverty stricken right retirement. saying want people travel like pre-pandemic? really understand help dad. Air travel part voluntary. can't force people feel comfortable flying again, can't really anything secure dad's future. guess I'm missing point relation dad financial security. start sending second week February, next week. said ""there currently evidence people vaccinated spread virus.""in sub. Naw man secret hydroxycloriquine. Thst shitll cure covid. Trust me, large amount money invested stocks put money mouth is. try it, what’s worst happen, death? sort vaccines tend provide stronger mucosal immunity?

Would intranasal ones? method delivery live attenuated viral vaccines? Yes risk groups vaccinated, society **will** reopen everywhere. damage society great compared minute loss life people demand it. Like 90% hospitalizations 60+, vaccinating almost eliminates pressure hospitals. ChAdOx -- Chimpanzee Adenovirus vector Oxford.

They're using chimpanzee adenovirus carry SARS-CoV-2 proteins immune system, developed Oxford. contrast mRNA vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer), human adenovirus vaccines (Janssen Ad5, Sputnik Ad5 &amp; Ad22), insect protein culture vaccine (Novovax), vaccine contains actual weakened SARS-CoV-2 (Sinovac).

They broke new research toys Covid. figure non-silly names call all. Ah fuck. can’t believe you’ve done 2 polio vaccines, one provided sterilizing immunity one male coworker going this, feel comfortable taking forced sterilization. 

He showed us article, stated (wrongly) impacts uterine lining. thought impacted male fertility. honestly baffled thought something impacted uterus directly sterilized men, remembered believes shit longer baffled. Copying response cuz hope helps u:

I cured visual snow regularly massaging sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle neck. Look it! yourself. Also stretching adjusting posture, mindful sitting positions long times (I work computer.) 

It’s really weird SCM muscle cause visual symptoms. gave migraines too. Still happens sometimes something try. Absolute nonsense. 50% efficacy normal amount flu vaccines et.al. long protect large portion vaccinated severe cases death job. Considering world live in, maybe should. cured visual snow regularly massaging sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle neck. Look it! yourself. Also stretching adjusting posture, mindful sitting positions long times (I work computer.) 

It’s really weird SCM muscle cause visual symptoms. gave migraines too. Still happens sometimes something try. ongoing issue Florida many Florida, reported deaths 16,400 people COVID-19, says public may able trust numbers. 

It brand new virus/disease nobody seen people die *on average* 3 serious health conditions. someone gets covid dies heart attack prove covid really cause? someone dies home without medical attention?

To think fatalities counted accurately fantasy, necessarily mean consistently over- under-counted.

The UK finally switched simple metric someone dies tested positive Covid within 28 days counts covid death. actually decreased number fatalities first switched it. I’m aware data confirmation ability reduce transmission greatly influence policy decisions.

I know it’s significantly likely slow prevent transmission decisions require evidence. don’t think would get types decisions without data. probability standpoint conclusion almost given, findings speed economic recovery. Yes that’s I’m referencing would bring number significantly 50% eager get it. 

I would *not* include refuse category. 

This brazenly incorrect since peddles BS narrative 50% getting vaccine. 

I appreciate pedantic conversation attempt condescending seems like going head. Yes, lots people aren’t getting message. 
A lot people think they’re vaccinated shouldn’t quarantine. isn’t enough evidence reach conclusion. paralyzed now! mean, I’d hope guy put jail spreading fear like admit british citizens weren’t targetted? whole fucking point.

Gotta honest - Kind shitty point argument made they've literally poisoned random civilians foreign soil NATO shit it.

You try shift goalposts like, fact they've already got proven track record poisoning people abroad sovereign nations. remotely character want en masse.

If think Putin would willing give go ahead something like I'm sure help overcome mental blockage. Newsom's approval rating went toilet. Despite Twitter Reddit say, measures popular. first person who's quoted too, black lady talking stupid, unnecessary, labyrinthine mess navigate--while extremely ill--just starve sick.

I sincerely hope people come around take vaccine, we're going find way communicate people like this--whose government flashing two giant middle fingers entire lives--to trust one, know how.

The effete, well-to-do, hippie antivax grifters fuck though. Ah twat. Fair enough. definitely people refuse wear mask forced go. want wear mask, go... simple... done....

I grow weary folks thinking mostly imaginary 'rights' trump rights everyone around them. Easier store manufacture (although last point might turn around quickly mRNA stuff experience scale). *downside* much limited immune response generates. Think first line defense. mRNA stuff become second line, potentially quickly adapted form QR medicine mutations. third line medication, probably form antibodies. Fourth line improved intensive care. No? No. know I’ll get downvoted can’t one think data probably sus. saying it’s unsafe I’m sure it’s better nothing (ie flu vaccine levels) man feel like get article every week claiming different efficacy. Hopefully US trial data solid could also healthcare worker 65 (unlikely Reddit, possible).  Fck CNN lot registered nurses refusing vaccine too.

Source: work hospital math.  Look number people confirmed disease US vs. number deaths US.

Research papers estimate guess fatality rates, actual statistics report really happened. We’re going back normal summer regardless anything.  really scary. temporary measures enforced due 9/11 still here. still cannot bring large tooth paste tube hand luggage single foiled terrorist attack chance successful long ago. keep seeing variants reduce vaccine effectiveness, never see whether still helps keep people hospital reduce effectiveness cause vaccine help all.

I'll something keep busy I'm stuck home weeks"" still use Sputnik everybody tho Putin pushed final without phase... realize AstraZeneca received billion pounds gov funding right? Moderna received billion dollars U.S. government. Pfizer received hunreds millions funding German government. 

And surprise, none pretending holy grail COVID-19 acting like space race. They're concentrating vaccinating people. Meanwhile Russia's PR team working double time act like global Russian gov funded vaccine research completely normal expected considering wanted first push successful vaccine sick population devastate already shitty economy. 

Oh, admit Kremlin's numbers. acting like Lancet conducted study came numbers. Try moving seen scientists criticising data published Lancet

That's *just* literally nothing suggest vaccine work.

And objectively speaking, nothing say either, unless readily believe info paid Kremlin bragging rights. Lmfao.   Relatively people smartphone Europe.

But bigger number people older smartphones, limit capacity, already running essential apps fighting planned obsolescence. happy owner 6 7 year old mobile running Android 6. governments care that, like many ""necessary"" apps banking stuff make compatible?

Kudos making effort! Best luck!

My reaction 2nd Pfizer shot pretty mild... hours vaccine, arm pretty sore went bed early. Spent following day feeling like hang over, 2nd day, woke feeling fine lingering arm soreness.  negate experience credentials way, look Marburg see (site approval) done within weeks. Also would intrigued learn pharma manufacturing industry planet would benefit standardization comes quality scale. 

I found white paper: http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/posters/PN-LPN-2375-PAT-Controlling-Product-Collection-Process-Scale-LPN2375-EN.pdf 

I time cursory glance, badly mistaken setup described paper straightforward replicate. Even *if* straightforward, still fail understand spatial differences (same process, different place) make difference comes regulations. Refuses present tense form verb refuse.

People ""waiting seeing"" people currently refusing vaccine. people need convince get vaccine. 

You threw powerful phrase: ""brazenly incorrect."" One turns spectrum opinions binary decision actually exists ""brazenly study you’re citing **not** include figures.

You add extra word? Because, yeah, ""wait see"" survey. dad got vaccination appointment next week. he's clinically vulnerable excited rollout. ambiguity came preclinical trials. specific vaccine prevent replication virus upper respiratory tract monkeys. means likely stopping viral spread completely reasonable assume something similar might happen people. ever dude. still answer questions. Sanofi GSK already vaccine production facilities Canada produce things like polio flu vaccines.

Medicago Canadian vaccine company R&amp;D Canada, Canadian manufacturing facilities yet operational. produce virus-like particle (I think) vaccines using tobacco plants, way better old method chicken eggs. think algae end surpassing tobacco plant method eventually.

Precision NanoSystems Vancouver received 25 million dollars upgrade facilities gain production capabilities mRNA vaccines, though developing COVID jab. production line done 2023 anyways.

Providence Therapeutics leading mRNA vaccine Canada, expect approval late year. clue current production capabilities are, it'd nice could license production Pfizer await clinical trial results.

People like compare us USA wonder level biotech them, answer federal government necessarily better supporting industry; Boston perfected art hub biotech startups. need post-doc/pro fessor Harvard/MIT say idea loud enough, hundred venture capitalists swarming millions dollars. Then, start company area easy access critical facilities Harvard/MIT company grows (because can't afford every piece equipment need).

Kind rant, hope illuminating you. Well actually bit stretch think 95% effective vaccine would stop spread... little odd even conversation. Sure conclusive data yet vaccines work. People weirdly seem think world's first vaccine know “If vaccine that’s 95 percent effective reducing symptoms, universe wouldn’t also reduce likelihood transmission. It’s possible,” said. “So we’re talking whether reduces transmission not, want get extent OMG, anything negative Israel gets deleted here?  point don’t think twice deaths. accept certain number deaths every cause, to. covid it’s going number greater 0, less 400,000.

E.g. annual flu shot guessing game.

IDK misunderstanding vaccinated people still get infected virus get sick. maybe think small fraction vaccinated people vaccine provide full protection ones spread it. maybe covid vaccine specific enough virus that's' spreading. mean, might actually true talking Amazonas, state Brazil Manaus is. article individuals aged 20-49 age groups sustaining resurgent SARS-CoV-2 transmission reproduction numbers well one, least 65 100 COVID-19 infections originate individuals aged 20-49 US.

We reached herd immunity however long herd immunity lasts virus. There’s little indication even effective vaccine we’d able bring covid measles levels. They’re completely different. I’d expect covid around smaller numbers time indefinitely think clarification opposed detail. initial comment made appear given data have. take want to. modern ""conservatism"" works days. probably believe covid-19 real begin with. Back coma please anyone else think US variants much longer people realize that's caused winter surge? probably last line receive vaccine vaccinated people allowed live normally too. 
Sure people less likely take vaccine don’t get anything personally Fauci 2025 ""the best way fight virus put bullet skull"" Covid 💎💎💎 ✋✋✋ moon Even results agree common sense prior experience vaccines, good verification. nothing man. He's great human being. need try normalise concept raise funds NHS meant funded government. taken advantage media government cover utterly inept try push idea Britain great. Hopefully if/when it’s established vaccines thing, messaging shift “nothing changes get vaccine” “you resume normal living one month getting final dose”.

That encourage many people fence take vaccine sure. not? people get PCR twice. I've got 3 times PCR :P. calling manipulated ever, really know. I'm saying see people could counted twice. Covid cannot eliminated point, lockdowns not. probably saved people blocking tho .. know numerous people died severe reactions .. paralyzed etc..

why ignoring ? real life version meme ""oh boy, can't wait hug kiss friends loved ones"" Yes, also mean much complex supply chain well major defficiencies clinical trials (since sense vaccines 'compete' trial patients other). Mechanisms used necessarily unique either, vaccines basically target issue using different approaches, meaning absolutely could rendered useless mutation. one dose reduces PCR positivity 67%, two doses reduces PCR positivity 49% ???  

Somehow, doubt second dose negative effect. 

Reading paper, statistics wide confidence intervals. CI 49.5% figure (7.4%, 72.2%).  CI 67% figure (49%, 78%).  overlapping confidence intervals, thw wide CI lower figure, suggest second dose helpful 49% figure would suggest. Trudeau's government never missed deadline moved goalpost? hope meet deadline, math adding point. got mine Rite Aid yesterday lady said they're 20 appointments per day stop giving 4pm. I'm sure increased little supply much. 9 million NJ wish percentage people vaccinated :-( That's true all. immune system attacks pretty much every virus comes body mean every virus attack produce sterilizing immunity prepped vaccine.

A vaccine anything give full-blown sterilizing immunity train immune system beat virus easily. flu vaccine good example vaccine lower efficiency might become immune probably increased immune response.. 


Every reaction virus hosts immune system potentially completely different much based ever-changing virus package chemicals.. assuming viruses way similar really that's think reaction immune system virus going predictable.

Viruses similar produce similar results inside human body that's keeps leading astray think immunity one generic term kind means thing across board. NOPE! Vaccines immune responses specific virus course host. 

The one big illusion simply we've picked easiest viruses vaccinate throughout history modern medicine makes look like vaccines produce long-lasting sterilizing immunity often do.

If vaccines viruses would see much greater variation vaccines perform instead something looks like best case scenario. style allow nickname ""Joe"" instead using full name ""Joseph?"" course known throughout world nickname, already adding name obvious adhere writing style nickname? curious. 65s get AZ vaccine France Fauci play politics given position he's in, assume many statements effort get people open idea vaccinated.

I’ve heard almost nothing quality hybrid instruction (as teacher know it’s nothing like normal school seems get ignored most). know parents I’ve talked keeping kids home safety reasons.

Edit: mean “teachers won’t jobs?” argumentative, genuine question. broad overlap people infected people getting vaccinated. ANOTHER GOP lawmaker charged sleazy crime, preying people paid serve!

Do criminal become GOP lawmaker? 

&amp;#x200B;

Is Republican bylaws something? point don’t trust msm source. want put fear inside Agree. obvious given mechanism vaccines work: producing neutralizing antibodies.

People previously said know expressing uncertainty warranted.

This study, however, puts number it. detailed explanation thing said. can't quickly vaccinate population enough vaccine so. small population, willingness provide data Pfizer efficient health care system worked Israel's favor here. know 2 People personally got reninfected confirmed. Youre wrong Numbers. Vaccines won’t available kids least year two. eliminate greatly reduce virus community, amount illness unvaccinated people low. 

Kids cancer can’t get MMR vaccine, don’t get mumps around vaccine. babies - don’t get shot age 1. protection comes others. Terrific terrifying. 25% formerly infected still get variants pretty strongly too.

No, reporting emerging mutations end. can't handle it, get TV. Newspaper journalism much balanced, mostly, choose paper follow - online fine too.

Due relatively high price, cannabis often prescribed pain relief methods failed. Preparations THC also used patients multiple sclerosis, reduce muscle spasticity, oncology measure vomiting nausea, people appetite, happens cancer AIDS.

\- interesting study published 2017 medical journal New England Journal Medicine. showed cannabidiol reduces frequency seizures children adults epilepsy, says Prof. Wawer. Subsequent studies shown CBD reduces frequency epilepsy also improves general condition patients. likely substance reduces overstimulation nerve cells brain, making seizures less likely occur. - Perhaps CBD works similar way people suffering Parkinson's disease. them, preparations CBD relieve hand tremors, hypothesis - says Prof. Wawer. Last year, team scientists University Sao Paolo summed scientific knowledge use CBD Parkinson's disease. Proven

No, pay them. Please cite research, Fauci can't. Find research says wearing two masks better wearing one. Fucking anti-vaxers. 

Listen science. AstraZeneca exempt vaccine liability nothing worry case anything wrong. system exists. Interesting didn’t seem problem prior moment.

I five dollars says voted eliminating cash bail. believe they're boosters wrong say Pfizer Moderna won’t enough end pandemic America? Ppl want truth, Rainbows unicorns sunshine. tell people even they're vaccinated can't travel, can't congregate, can't stop masking.

CNN great source hard science reportage. think depressing part ""no fun allowed!! PANDEMIC!!!!!!"" people, misanthropic comes off. remember back spring lockdowns lot people saying ""wE vIRuS"". Probably third quarter, US UK initial orders filled.   choice vacuum, I'd go mRNA ones. mind two small jabs one small jab, seems better.

But choice (or least people won't, short term) vaccine going anyone's arm soon physically possible. 

That said, I've already gotten recovered Covid, I'm real rush get vaccine. I'll grab whatever best available summer time. Even then, it'll still mild flu people. makes dangerous first time around one preexisting immunity.

I feeling whole pandemic cause people get yearly flu shots, though. I've read, there's already uptick people getting vaccinated flu, good sign. Oregon (knock wood) extremely lucky lately regards cases / vaccine. data currently available point positive decision regarding benefits risks,""

I know taken directly [Swissmedic's English version three (main) official languages Switzerland German, French Italian. languages' versions, text reads follows (quoting aktuell vorliegenden Daten erlauben noch keinen positiven Nutzen-Risiko Entscheid.

I'm happy hear that, course, one saying can't concerned. is, however, big difference concern disavowmnent.

gl m8! depends define normalcy. States begin easing restrictions much earlier level, would still higher burden medical system, possibly mask requirements crowded indoor places like trains, kind thing. feel like could solution areas, lot time stepping trail contribute erosion harm delicate ecosystems. probably huge issue less popular trails deep backcountry, probably better wear mask stay trail heavily-used trail. flew 4 times holidays cases considerably higher now. fine. People pretty good distance planes HEPA filters now. It’s risky anything else point. CNN dooming. second doses trailing. CNN, news bad news.

Aprove already! I'm trial 99.99% positive got placebo, I'm slated get real deal goes green. Reuters link it. ""at least"" five months seem depend individual, 100% understood yet. also seem pretty like can't assume permanent immunity either virus vaccine. כל הכבוד, אכן! actuality, Fauci said idea percentage - one does. He's throwing numbers boost vaccination efforts. likelihood real number somewhat lower, again, know.

We'll know hit numbers inflect strongly downwards. pretty common thing happen around disasters. nice. FWIW health experts don’t make public policy. did, cigarettes wouldn’t exist McDonald’s would business. thought next time doctor so-and-so says stay inside next eternity. Bruh maybe gave tren instead vaccine Assuming you’re 65-70 good health, fun! you’re worried self quarantine arrive home. places require masks CA anything indoor closed, weather may nice there, enjoy it! Thank you, refreshing see voice reason nuance comes topic, everyone seems falling two sides false dichotomy here.

That's exactly right, lost jobs company either closed afford keep restrictions mandates. think companies want close, lay people off? cases, sure, companies want stay open make money.

The concerts thing great question, would say depends when. March, April, May 2020? Absolutely not. many unknowns point. scared death back then, happily locked nice house big yard wife son watched Tiger King worked home kept getting paychecks. Honestly, pretty fun time. middle May, learned virus worked risk, started question continued need restrictions. Since then, certainly now, 11 months whole thing started, think nuts opened back (concerts included) reasonable guidelines place protect 15% population serious risk contract Covid. Side effects include, square jaw, six pack abs getting laid. 

Call doctor 3 sexual partners within 6 hours. make easier? They're going proportionally fewer nurses, distribution centers, etc. Moderna working mRNA flu vaccine, could probably combined. Anyone else actually preferring J&amp;J vaccine one shot probably accesible? Somehow vaccine looks lot elegant me, best solution anyone ages 18 65 need bulletproof infection protection, protection death hospitalization. Frankly care getting little sick, actually nice break things get cold. 

If choice, think prefer J&amp;J. Less needles arm! Flying incredibly risky right unless going go recommended quarantine protocols. Especially since presumably staying multiple people different households. Annual vaccinations like flu. Wear mask majority population vaccinated. return normal life. We're like 5 months away. COVID going away - endemic. flu. We'll fine

I understand frustration. Interesting. wasn’t chills anything, sore hell sore usually intense workout. husband saying cold second dose really abnormal may him. Thanks sharing, makes feel better knowing aren’t alone!!  many person workers skilled jobs took years internships, apprenticeships education become journeyman. can’t shoulder tap someone jump jobs. would still go in. defining ""return sense normalcy""?

70% might reasonable ""return September 2019 normalcy;"" really ""do things enjoy doing, occasionally capacity restrictions mask requirements"" that's necessarily best way go, especially high risk people. Let's goooooooo science says risk lower situation?

Lower. Outdoor anything quite bit lower transmission rates. marches people masked. declined make ceremony, husband, COVID-19. 

She's turning avoid political statements.

She's still great person, nowhere said turned Trump. want get vaccine badly!  people work high-risk profession definitely deserve front line. think general population expect receive vaccine? I’ve seen many different timelines.  zero evidence covid causes anything besides normal post viral syndrome. I’m wrong provide studies.

People get flu experience continues lesser senses covid long hauler claims, difference flu isn’t common yearly infection wise it’s heard about

Edit: complain downvoted echoe chamber, long term claim people ones burden proof covid somehow acts manically different common viruses avoid hazard need acknowledge real. 
People want tone troll away things don’t want real. 
Optimism pessimism useful. Coronaviruses known difficult vaccinate against, due ability avoid immunity. 
I’m favour doom-mongering, open facing facts. 
If want look coronaviruses vaccination take look vaccination pigs cows works. ya got states prioritizing/planning prioritize front line workers (including grocery). Wisconsin, they'll next group 65+. don’t watch grandma?? Jesus fuck. sub man.... care? vaccines means less deaths sounds good actually make sense. lot measures *could* take like banning swimming banning large sodas would probably prevent deaths cause, mean *should* take measures. absolutely revolutionary impacts ability technology astounding.  


We probably need FDA others build new guidelines approving modified mRNA vaccines given ""easy"" technical perspective. We'll probably need versioning system point. Queue Patch Tueday references antivaxxers! 

 
The idea Moderna shot people getting basically existed year ago really blow mind - rest testing safety efficacy bureaucracy necessitated that. 


I doubt near future we'll mRNA shots contain multiple vaccines efficacious. science disagrees can't get infected someone talking table outdoors hour? 

Or science says risk lower situation? bad much population won’t care still regardless r/ihatesportsball Excellent! Yeah, happy hear it. surprised ignorant it. Get facts!!! Unless missed sentence that. still needs pass clinical trails ?

Assuming cure used early enough. totally, that's one lesser vaccines terms effectiveness. imagine Pfizer/Moderna even stop transmission ‘could’, ‘will’. hell wants KOMA 11 months, regardless time is? Forgive ignorance I'm surprised 11-month coma allowed hospitals operating full capacity midst pandemic. I'm happy he's regained consciousness though, ruling pull plug someone coma? Especially covid-19 era hope US Oxford data comes soon. looking pretty decent UK. Yea dissonance quite remarkable. comical point. zombIes. job. Bills....yes.   read German news. sad. good man I've read.  true, also can’t help poor guy won’t mask he’s intubated Bullshit. De*ocrat?!? guy masks follows science? Nice try lol missed much insane shit. nitpick even more, ""Sir Tom"" would appropriate form address, ""Captain Moore"", ""Captain Tom"" acceptable colloquial sense, used formally, ""Sir Moore"" wrong. exactly immune system does, free. US going turn things around first half year. watching Europe, yes. like man. I'm glad leading EU. start war allies. I’ve lucky managed avoid getting it, work A&amp;E, antibodies either! 1st jab 2nd 3 weeks 🙌🏼 taking vaccine morning sky news regarding pre-print. honestly, feels kinda weird keep talking vaccine others efficacy... Yes, can't imagine horrible must Europeans doors, exception main one, welded shut huge appartement complexes. absolute horror must us go single entrance :( shows lax hospital hygiene protocol. prioritized protecting nursing homes, important initial step took, time forcibly shutting businesses. What's sub downvoting article that's positive news? virus caused severe problems society post downplay virus gets mass downvoted. think worst possible outcome lying people era science education already terrible justification lying greater good.

And think masks debacle made very, _very_ obvious bad idea. anyone link decent guidance vaccinated parents unvaccinated children best protect kids? how/if behavior changed parents vaccinated? really noticed too. Dude. guy skipped 2020. think worst possible outcome would telling people likely knew, could encourage vaccinated people break restrictions spread virus. GO BACK SLEEP also call ‘hospital acquired pneumonia’ ‘HAP’, mostly it’s quicker say guess also avoids ‘our bad’ part ""completely disregarding"" wtf talking about? come think it, people fought reopen ASAP last April, restaurant could open again, made catastrophe lot worse needed be. stop whining. guy fucking go away? Fr. Fuck kids. ain't special. (*issa joke*) sat 5 minutes trying think word gave up! thank even remotely comparable. person eats burger that's choice one forcing them. anti vaxxer protestors preventing people getting vaccine could save life. one people later catches Covid dies involuntary manslaughter. Enough non-European countries think guess what? Life pretty much returned normal places. Weird works hu? what’s OT? travesty science reporting treated likely outcome anyway while, fine, finally evidence move excellent news. keeps shunting co-morbidities immuno-compromised--which I'm sure comprise good portion hospitalizations deaths--further back line. I'm starting sinking feeling we'll end becoming eligible time general public. Good thing haven’t seen kill bill 🤣  wars, cities bombed,

People awful mental health 20th century rate deaths despair (suicides, drugs, alcohol) higher recently. talking mental health calling people soft part problem. hospitals learned nothing previous pandemics? addition greater infectiousness, immune escape means advantage original people survivor immunity original version least time can't reinfected original version. recovered immune would first line new version way global transmission network works: globe trotting road warriors insatiable tourists first one survived, still are. unconquerable psychologic drive congregate, still do. refused believe first threat personally survived it, even sure second one.

However, sort injury keeps coma long very, bad news. assumed meant workers &amp; owners dude like restaurant going shovel dessert people’s throats I'm sure he's got pressing concerns covid. give two shits compared stuff he's going dealing with.

People thinking even radar pretty self absorbed. [Vaccines potentially slowing hugely good news probably go radar here. Good him! guy brought lot joy kids dark place. momentous news. knew possible good see case extent. Hopefully keep rollout going smoothly allow life return normal fast possible.  Got repeat myself, no, AstraZeneca restricted under-65s.

It's ""recommended preferentially given 65s data"".

But reasoning we're running Pfizer Moderna jabs, course 65 receive AZ ones.

Also thanks Crocodile tears Britain. sarcasm really helpful. freaking fuck right went Disney World January 17th - 19th 2020. last real adventure peak covid crisis early March. thinking similar things walked around &amp; could think walked past large crowds people calm storm.

Okay, know caught covid twice, coma longer Barry allen, blissfully unaware whole ordeal sounds pretty nice me. vaccine works advertised reduces likelihood infection 90%+, vaccinating everyone tremendously reduce R number vaccine. R number 3 vaccine, would less 0.3 everyone vaccinated. course refuse take vaccine, difficult keep R well 1 effectively end major outbreaks. fewer people infected, virus less chance mutate. Ok, choose to? thank much love people like common sense information preliminary. mask fit fine. jam mask close eyes can, tickles lower eyelid (gf sewn slightly bigger mask insertable filters me, helps).

Russia released vaccine without properly completing trials, Chinese vaccine data still unknown different countries report different data it, Brazil data low side.

If want vaccine properly tested thats good you, see anything wrong people questioning vaccine properly tested. good news though vaccination still leaves significant (though greatly reduced) change catching covid-19, data seems suggest results near-zero chance needing hospitalisation dying. *Via reporter BrieAnna J.

Perfect content Groundhog's Day  teachers risk pneumonia, frostbite, electrocution order go inside, masks required everyone? see skipped class learned scientific method. live NYS there's single school district around closed. I’m sorry virus first reported China end December 2019. I’ve personally following things virus related (news, videos, chats) since end January 2020. I’ve wearing masks since February, following closely did. known spread still known now. little old know January dear dr Fauci didn’t know April? Come now, I’m calling bullshit. dude damn director NIAID you’re going tell doesn’t insider information don’t have, course does. Furthermore, others see China shutdown whole city 11 million, boarded people homes, built containment facilities house Covid patients, alarm bells weren’t going off???? Again, I’m calling bullshit. Even damn NBA shut March. You’re going tell people NBA know better dr Fauci? NBA knows Dr Fauci doesn’t. Stop nonsense. Everybody knew virus KNEW masks necessary. US would pulled plug 10 months ago family would still bankrupt. important ""skeptics"" convinced get vaccine. general fine skipping people line show hesitation, 30-40% latino black community jump chance get vaccine, communities continue suffer. Especially since America decently segregated still groups tend live amongst other. 

That education campaign needs happen ""everyone wants one, gets one"", now. communities lot death death prevention goal need fix this. might take celebrities showing aint dead vaccine. Maybe seems dumb, strategy deployed many decades. many people there? Meanwhile Canada... fine. Chances one it, chances get it, especially tried best stay 6 ft away everyone.

Covid make whole room toxic, least easily. could willing accept that. different Christianity say Europe? think non denominational churches makes Christianity crazy. major denominations seem pretty uniform across countries. less 80 days left school year! We’ve made far...let us vaccinated first start fresh next year!! feel like JFK easily could stood Joe F Kennedy another universe. Girl, same. hate say it, pretty soon there's going way vaccines people willing get it. instant anyone starts urging people get there's going droves anti-vaxers coming out. I'd hope so. hacked everyone elses research, makes sense like may become ""just around corner"" thing repeated every week. one would take - given opportunity choose? Oh man hope best Agreed. spouse post-viral neuro-autoimmune disease one knows do. maddening took millions people getting sick people realize doctors different specialties need talk collaborate (other acute situations, happens regularly).  Take USA,

US bought them, Pfizer manufacturing, they're American. reason haven’t used least here, nursing homes. People aren’t coming them. almost completed round 1 middle round 2 complete end February. Interesting. However I'm reading:


citizens advised leave houses - advised forced

For time, city full lockdown, people expected self-isolate 40 days member household suspected plague, taken hospital - right isolating sick.

I see full lockdown smoke cigarettes ..boom .. eligible predict toilet paper? part ’funny’ It’s probably latter. people getting hospital probably vaccination rates increased Fair enough, fault country can't produce vaccine? Pfizer Moderna promised deliver Covid vaccine countries done. patient. Wow, thank lot. Everything’s clear :) stay safe mate! People realize it’s every state saying it’s time now. Michigan back governor put “deadline March 1.  think saw Jay Inslee practically tell teachers Washington shut get class...
It’s getting pretty bad.   fucking hell CPS give another month give goddamn vaccination *On one hand, ""slept"" grueling 11 months frankly would something would loved skip.*

Dude... mean, best 11 months ever, overall fine us. barely notice pandemic anymore, normal now. think every death horrible also looked context many quality years life lost. think everyone agrees 85 year old dementia dying lot less sad healthy 22 year old dying. New variants come would render current vaccines useless. Back drawing board April. thing NEVER GO AWAY. Book it. Sounds like 2/3 fired replaced.

Edit: Words GL Rapha South Korean pharmaceutial company currently producing Sputnik V. That’s bonafide malarkey. Trudeau never betrayed America.  gotta wiggle big toe bit, right? heard somewhere approved mixing vaccines. get J&amp;J get Pfizer Moderna later.....at least right now. would committed J&amp;J booster shots cross mRNA ones. sound bad me! nice, please. fat people, don’t wanna fat shaming, gotta lose weight going diet exercising free time.

Maybe that, maybe health issues causing that, on. bend backwards telling guy go see friends want give family covid. main reason booster cause long-lasting immunity. believe Moderna 85% effective one shot. administering? Number vaccinations today dropped hard Basically variants bind quickly thoroughly human cells. Like stronger form glue. number people / particles / contacts produce cases.  We're anti anything government says since least 07 so...

Source: french Yoloed won. Sick move. poor minority kids? given choice, families choose keep home. Look major city attempted bring kids back. white parents want kids school, many people color don’t think it’s safe choose stay virtual. 

Katrina kids lost lots school turned fine. kids miss school around world war civil unrest. 

All sudden everyone cares poor black brown kids.... Ah yes, favorite wing sauce correct, live believe know.  could make prequel explores things got bad.... would news footage last 5 years one masks obviously anything doubling instead admitting mistake. arrest first time. would anti-vector antibodies fade much faster ones spike protein? would efficacy go instead booster nothing?

My hunch exhaustion and/or tolerance. immune cells see much virus short amount time burn stop functioning well. would also explain weird result vaccine better efficacy first dose cut half. Oh hell yes! symptomatic covid-19 mean? thing though able boost supply immediately? Thr EU purchased enough vaccines problem there's lack supply right now. mean I'm pleasantly surprised given tried roll early last year

Russian laws work like that. register vaccine first starting phase 3. mass media made elephant fly. Neither league single positive covid case inside bubble. That’s Malarkey, Jack. chance Biden would betray ally like that. tend believe high degree personal freedom long harm others. want sick? fine. want die? fine. want addict? fine. burden society one's stupidity. makes air harder pass mask comes sides. Watch quickly come ""scientific"" reason that's incorrect though. need let people live.

You mean ""just let people die"" assume going you.

I'd personally favor sort license, people want go live get put list, they're second line medical care get sick behind try stay home safe. Also, infect someone else dies, they'd prosecuted.

That way, people understand risk limited like rest us worry taking hospital resources needed people trying stay safe. Where? Afaik haven’t released concrete data it. Moderna proved work UK strain, Novavax even shown 89-90% effective it. point best require people wear one mask. anticipate people go way put two masks on. I’m it!  Generally wear surgical cloth mask N95/KN95 helps keep N95/KN95 clean. N95/KN95 perfectly fine fit properly protect others, everything I've read. Except Florida...source: living Florida Fine, dead end year virus turned captain Tripp’s.   Germany, Poland France enforced rule can’t given over-65s $VAX moon said. Kids won’t vaccinated. Pfizer vaccine 16 up, Moderna 18 up. Trials started kids 12 older. 

If enough adults get vaccine, kids fine.  Actually no. Even without Northeast number low. nuclear power plants (not kidding) would quarantine even work suburbs? literally walk Bronx Yonkers. Many people live suburbs work city would happen them? likely does. IIRC early data Israel suggest probably does. real hard dats yet say sure. reality vaccines probably stop transmission matter much really need someone IRL. Yep. It’s needle hub needs smaller, good ones shortage. using eclipse needles 23g. beginning vanishpoints 27g (I’m little unsure gauges both). Never problem vanishpoints. aspiration eclipse points basically kills 6th dose. 

So making 1.85mL NS. state inconsistent supplies. Like nothing thought out. TON 21g needles draw NS, literally 10,000 needles, aren’t going give 60,000 doses 10,000 vials NS. It’s total mess. US isn’t market Sputnik V. It’s middle income countries. Putin syringe! happens coddle society.
You can’t burn businesses, loot, raid capital, block vaccine without consequences. Sorry disappoint you. asking anyone else that. choose wait mRNA vaccine would solely responsible social distancing protecting myself. People get vaccinated feel safe would free whatever want. would impact anyone me. long run, would make feel safer live happier life.  -18 C normal state (cheaper) +2..+8 C use freeze-drying (more expensive). I've realised people sub understand difference ""there evidence confirm vaccines stop transmission"" ""vaccines stop transmission"". People need understand there's evidence yet thst mean stop transmission. research needed New version “It’s flu”.  Ok said states decide shipped. left state. state Virginia doses go hospitals great people work hospitals people. wonder shift pharmacies retail locations get health care workers. Why? Russia legacy vaccine production facilities track record independent development. would gain releasing substandard vaccine? It’s peer reviewed third parties. It’s almost certainly reliable.  Japan resident here. 

Pfizer going (finally) approved couple weeks, healthcare workers starting vaccinations later month. Then, country's (extremely large) senior population vaccinated. We've told vaccinations general population start July, I'll believe see it. government's coronavirus response around disappointing. NBA’s bubble actually successful whatever say  hope silver lining invest heavily research learn treat better. Long covid sounds similar Lyme Disease people suffering years without much hope relief. didn’t take GF hospital did, I’m sure worse would another 24 hours. family didn’t want take hospital afraid would alone possible visitors. crazy sounds, I’m certain mind many people died waited far long get proper help. know politics British Isles, almost unbelievably aggressive.

If know anything politics area, using term ""British Isles"" pretty aggressive ignorant Children going vaccinated time soon even many teachers waiting months.  Ah, looks like we're working. Better stop it. Thank :)  Time start believing, friend. go back coma now? hope Biden it. So-called liberal Trudeau America, lets return favor full. Shut border hard let vaccinations complete. Give taste medicine.  think would able tolerate covid-19. I'll keep wearing N95, steamy may be. hospital one places likely get sick. grandma died pneumonia contracted treated fall took. quite common. trying imply people reddit experts science pretend know everything fair, Trump Biden ton resources disposal puts huge advantage rest country.

So think definitely call Trump stupid catching COVID simultaneously insulting millions Americans also got it.

With said, think anyone stupid catching highly infectious disease. huge vindication UK policy recent data single dose efficacy spacing.

It worked best them.... doesn’t mean wasn’t still risky. Iirc, viral load higher. Higher concentration virus droplets = higher chance transmitted. Don’t think need change behavior, keep we’re doing. Ventilation important distance. Here's food thought. young people still go day even sick. get tested downplay bad cold. severely sick suffer though it. Dying 30 year olds, know true numbers yet. impossible anywhere close accurate . tough decisions past year - they’re handed simple plan: send people back school vaccinated. ‘Aw hell naw, simple!’ put vaccine pretty damn high, anyway. Practically shoulder Gemalaya Institute great track record vaccine production it’s peer reviewed Lancet. yes think data Sputnik V accurate. mean, Hunger Games point many areas. show must go on. Even people die. Yes, lockdowns worked (and working) places - deaths caused stopped locking down. E.g. Portugal, ok relaxed restrictions Christmas.

This rocket science, clever trick. Covid spreads social contact. Reduce contact, reduce spread, reduce deaths. turn tap, water comes out. turn off, water stops. turn again, water comes - mean taps work?? kind knowledge requires actually reading article know Sure announced stay home enforced followed majority population. LA roads packed usual past couple months travelers come CA. could still stay home Florida even though restriction. Conversely travel, wear mask go bars California without consequence despite stay home order. much difference end day although guess California significantly lower death rate. Florida also likely benefits humid warm weather year round, factors likely lead lower infection rates. surprise weather. Numbers probably tomorrow too. Thursday Friday could big days though. Brazenly incorrect? No, think is.

He's right, [50% population currently refusing still need convince folks get it. Now, think /u/SumoBeto overstating difficulty getting many folks convinced 25% ""flat refuse get vaccine circumstance"" high/outdated.

And important numbers trending right direction. can't overstated, likely work hard get numbers 75%-80%. aside value judgments life versus money jazz, i'll address last question.

why want friends? presumably still disagree them, presumably still disagree you, words said change, words change, bother? situation comes (in case pandemic related events) shows friends cannot civilized one another (or them, you, whichever combination) bother trying friends them? think still ""hope"" reconcilation ""need"" something particular mental health wellbeing it.

i come opposite sides thought process friends vastly different views could work way everyone comfortable i'd find new friends amount ""work"" compared benefits less Agreed. People don’t understand anything scientific method nothing science 💯. We’re talking population average 8th grade reading level. shitty say, shouldn’t talking science people. messaging needed “in months vaccine go back whatever selfish ass thing want!” People would eat up. much survival bunkers go nowadays?? going deliver take away food, robot? favor much pressure open places business education. people vaccinated, even vaccines shown limit transmissibility, pressure open increase. Yep. every time happens, say ""I told so"", gaslight say ""Well, maybe keep us safe!!!"" Yes does.. Voting change that. think part wider problem many people general science-illiterate saying ""we know yet"" seen permission wildly speculate, irresponsibly report stories, insert ideas blank fact, etc.  
 
In real world people can't handle ""I know's"" rationally, often somehow seen sign weakness, science, they're normal vital part learning process must handled rationally. one reasons reddit absolute shitshow people talking ass ridiculous assumptions they're capable admitting know something. Well, yeah. They're killing people. 

It's immediately obvious, successfully blocking vaccinations would kill people. dying part happen watching. happens later, people catch virus would vaccinated die. Really why? Credit / Debit card scanning machines everywhere, would thing. Okay please tell us disease contract later life got flu child?  would’ve failed regardless, group believes it’s effect would’ve one take money go get together friends house award best time coma goes to... think two weeks Pfizer moderna going happen though. lot conspiracy theorists saying actually happen. There, kill “we don’t know vaccines stop spread” ish now? Like, drown bathtub, shoot twice, throw cliff? Return world actually plan trips cringe compilation videos YouTube anti-maskers freaking out? Here’s bill details Democrats moving forward 

It’s hard find hasn’t written White House reaches bipartisan bill, Democrats voted Tuesday start process approving Biden's bill own, without GOP support. goal passage Cool jets.  We’re huge choosy beggars. November told I’d first Pfizer shot January, I’d ecstatic, second shot delayed feels like tragedy instead celebration vaccine all. Scroll 100's cases. It’s much safer less 6 feet someone mask off... Fauci stated adolescents (12-15) could vaccinated early summer Pfizer’s vaccine. Anecdotally, 15 year old study they’ve us sign updated paperwork saying study could unblinded within weeks, indicated they’re close submitting data FDA. Stupid people hold kinds careers. vaccines offer sterilizing immunity ? Yes no. A: nobody really knows. Uh, that's true flu all. people confused, people India mostly obedient. cause police hit people sticks constantly.

Anyone without mask would get hit can’t shake fact vaccinate nation every year new flu shot. know different, it’s frustrating. Ugh.  scroll bottom surveys — random testing antibodies — show majority people certain areas India may already exposed coronavirus, without developing symptoms. Last week, preliminary findings fifth serological study 28,000 people India's capital showed 56% residents already antibodies, though final report yet published. figures higher crowded areas. Last summer, another survey Mumbai's health department government think tank found 57% Mumbai slum-dwellers 16% people living areas antibodies suggesting prior exposure young country well. 6% Indians older 65. half population 25. young less likely die COVID-19 likely show symptoms infected. 100% this, want inadvertently increase spread poor messaging. Headline talking % people received full two doses.

So far 8-10% US pop received least one growing number studies concluding Covid-19 causes infertility. studies remotely correct, vaccines prevent Covid-19 help prevent infertility.  Understood see saying. IMHO even still it’s granular. Phase 1B three tiers. tiers specific parameters. takes time. People get confused. rush tier opens, demand can’t meet supply easily. model needs less clunky. 3 levels - easily definable parameters roll out. E.g first responders tier 1, 65 condition tier 2, everyone else Tier 3. Otherwise deadweight loss friction market tries equal out. Another day closer true normalcy countries less people worse. friends Scotland finished 80s there, gp 75 starting week. It’s going take 4-5 months first vaccination. agree give people feeling get pass told vaccines reduce transmissions drastically. Anti maskers already problem, imagine act way impunity hide behind saying they’re vaccinated (even aren’t) lived 25 years life, I'm 25, so... Yes get approved produced. WV get certain number vaccines allocated based population prioritize states? research numbers doubt WV access number vaccines needed Israel. Again, travel one thing, especially international, universe disease serious enough warrant private company accessing personal health information every time shop. serious?

Also, April 2020. Carol Baskin...Killed husband, whacked em’ 

On serious note TF here? think vaccine give pass like enough adult population vaccinated matter anymore. incredibly unfair young. problem supply. county says 20,000/week, receiving 1200/week. need vaccines increase administration rate substantially. that, RNA virus, natural tendency mutate (as proofreading mechanism like DNA viruses - think HPV). Several countries methods testing reporting. One case study U.S. [seen

Given age, guess you’ll make full recovery. Take care yourself, take vitamin C, zinc, tolerate melatonin night. Mucinex helps congestion clearing mucus lungs. hope speedy recovery. lot people aren’t vaccinated following rules anymore claiming they’re vaccinated. probably won’t comment definitively transmission closer herd immunity certainly want people ignoring social distancing claiming vaccinated havn't

So lying public vaccine effective really answer something like that? That's dangerous say variety selfish enough buy faked certificates negative covid19 test.

Can provide data happening? Again, exactly small claim make without backing stories studies occurring. concerning update vaccines even widely distributed. escaped variants become widespread (as seem doing), going playing 'whack-a-mole' time.

Perhaps hone antigenic component necessarily conserved? think Measles? part, easy vaccinate against.

I believe going need mix ever efficient vaccine design/delivery varying levels restrictions throughout year. doubt NZ friends opening borders anytime soon. Stem cells? full study found 🤨 number lab confirmed COVID cases - including minor asymptomatic ones probably confer long immunity - less 10% US population. 

*Theoretically,* knew minor cases gave vaccine grade immunity *and* undetected minor cases were, could skip them. don't, worth error mistakes. Many people think COVID fact COVID, that's ~ 80% negative test rate bad epidemics comes from.

And say, ex-varient South Africa reports things like antibody titers mild cases initial strain ineffective evolved one. 'waiting'.

They first need perfect vaccine variants take bit time. need test thousand people trial see actually works. need organise production vaccine alongside existing vaccines still need produce.

Autumn relatively accurate timeframe. mom went chili's two hours totally safe one there. Oh really? human beings cooking bringing food out? Ridiculous. british strain knocking door. wait nothing. end sight. Vaccine? Maybe summer. Maybe. punsihment young healthy.

A hardcore lockdown would better option never ending agony. It’s weird bridge straddle, technical communication rough. Especially since writers aren’t scientists scientists can’t write, lol. (My partner works field, although software, pharma). It’s whole lot conferences SMEs saying “ok translate English don’t need 3phds describe goal algorithm?” “no Mr. Reporter sir that’s accurate statement isn’t even websites work.” really think made movie called 28 days later Shhh, nobody tell /u/Square_Wing5997 really wear mask went hospital summer accidentally stabbing myself. o2 saturation low tested found positive. Didn’t notice anything though. spread misinformation. Thalidomide. 

And shouldnt, to. two vaccines shown 95 % efficacy similar endpoints other. Novavax good. even johnson Johnson good ( im also waiting results ensemble 2)

Not show good efficacy second dose starting show long term immunity. 

Az bad data, misleading statistics fought fda giving definitive answers. 

If efficacy 62% huge wide confidence interval looking 80% population needing vaccinated. truly 50% worth keeping. 

Now study. Plenty people pointed put problems including wide CI. 

Now, ""eu UK arent 3rd world""  well let know worrisome brexit becoming uk. giving vaccines months apart without supporting data. Oxford scar really doesnt work. Again. Thalidamide. Thalidamide.

AZ Could place, keep doubling bad data bad statistics. worrisome. Maybe us could 100% people take vaccine wouldnt bad. spread misinformation. assessment Germany suffered badly last months? mean [data 40 thousand deaths since start December. Worse, per capita, France. people deny facts they're inconvenient? Haha, Schroedinger's fridge. indirect incentives. Educated employees example. Good, affordable education obvious: look USA example. fair fault Park employees. allowed enact mask mandates, Federal agencies etc. Trump. covid penalty flag 100 yards loss governor's strategy restaurants consistently nonsensical. 

He re-shut indoor dining NYC December data showed 1.4% cases traced restaurants. 

He kept indoor dining shuttered months NYC even cases plummeted far parts state limited capacity indoor dining. 

When faced class-action lawsuit, explain restaurant Queens/Nassau border needed closed due COVID, yet restaurant literally street allowed indoor dining 2020. Except restaurants open state since June, exception 3-week period December. hasn’t stay-at-home order since initial lockdowns March April.

And far see it, everyone eating restaurant knows there’s risk eating out, choose anyway. fine me. Unless someone lives 90 y/o grandparents something don’t see problem it. literally travelled country last month. counted . 3.28 vaccines sight times . Remember ""flatten curve""?

The constant moving target it'll take get back normal driving me, imagine people, completely fucking crazy.

We went ""2 weeks flatten curve"" ""we probably go hockey game 85% country gets vaccinated, even still, guarantees new strains."" Anybody knows actually going see someone vaccinated Astra Zeneca vaccine EU? Yeah, certainly think important caution results proven yet. usually dangerous jump conclusions would surprising find vaccines stop transmission. case yes bad.. [Their preclinical trials showed vaccine didn’t stop viral replication upper respiratory tract] 100% realistic expect vaccine fully stop spread. 

This sub full scientifically illiterate dipshits don’t want accept bad news true. work professions named well emergency, I'm Barack Obama. hear reproduces incells. I'm sure people sub able make excuses resultant spike infections nothing lifting restrictions here. hope like im getting paranoid, think hope 4000+ possible reinfection South Africa proves reinfections don’t understand virus becomes endemic circulation immune evasion. know trolling actually believe this. rural areas one person wearing mask. reopening sports stadiums read previous posts understand asserted? logical outcome for-profit media industry.  good person still poorly educated. I’m jealous heard one before, that's unique potential side effect. 

That may one contact doctor that's odd one sure found [helpful months back, actually useful! 

If [short one work! Hurr durr religion bad know married couple got reinfected. You’re certainty 47 globally quite cute really. would think able schedule vaccination Mine usually patches sometimes split gets really irritated sensitive certain foods like pineapple anything salty. awhile doctors thought lupus ulceration. Okay, great, US reserves second doses, assuming everyone wants get line it’s like 9% Yay! great people disagree *are* selfish. They've constantly whined form restriction since day one.

These people complaining can't go bars clubs music festivals oh pandemic ruining best lives wahhhhh supposed fun 22 on.

I sympathy people effectively never gave shit all. restrictions stay place everything besides allowing people work safely least September.

People who've shown sense civic duty respect broader societies communities thrown bone simply want go back way things used they're ""depressed"".  one workers. lot propaganda thrown around. started actually research got first dose yesterday.  think greater chance happening June? able walk target Walmart able buy ps5? able schedule vaccination healthy young adult around 25-30? Oh sent everyone back several times two past semesters VA. keep tricking kids things different duping paying fees shouldn’t. LMAO, we're arguing court law here.

This corporate FOMO. good see France adapting difficult situation Europe finds actually work solutions increase vaccine production EU Spring. actually think citizens distracted US political news completely missed fact country wasn’t addressing vaccines properly. misinformation, Manaus’s seroprevalence likely overestimated reasons, either case there’s evidence widespread reinfection city. It’s hard monitor that. name know done tests before...  Perhaps article talking people received two doses? Chad ox vs virgin virus anyone know differences vax western vax? No, instead cars seatbelts. stop enough deaths, airbags. still deaths, early collision avoidance systems. equivalent wearing masks limiting capacity.

I’ve changed everything change help. It’s gone, it’s manageable now.

The thing can’t fix isolation. is. 🤷‍♀️ ""possible"" stage refuse look Manaus.

The reasonable expected outcome herd immunity other, frustrates me. law.

If something reckless, know (or know) chance killing someone leasing death would happened without action *and*

If someone actually dies action.

You committed crime Manslaughter. 

Preventing someone getting vaccine, especially someone high risk group, something know chance leading death action. anyone group trying get vaccine can't day, catches Covid19 get back, dies, folks blocking people vaccine commit Manslaughter. 

I'm lawyer one pretty obvious. 

Now whether anyone would get charged? Probably not. many ""what ifs,"" involved defense lawyer chip away at. likely protesters get away deadly felony unpunished. immunity, please reference following paper examined lasting immunity healthcare workers. reinfection rate (technically positive PCR individuals antibodies) 0.13 per 10,000 days risk.

Overall, reinfections exceedingly rare. BNO News collating case reports reinfections - vast majority mild asymptomatic case true reinfection difficult; needs sequencing compare viral genomes first second cases. Given exceedingly low rate confirmed reinfections, tough say initial infection cleared first case false positive (the false positive rate much higher reinfection rate). Well said would take six weeks tweak mRNA vaccines, include clinical trials take longer six weeks.

much happening behind stage. Trust live near campus tons cases never sent anyone back... Halvorsen great hero Berlin Airlift. likely thousands elderly Germans treasure memories cargo planes flying hoping lucky pieces chocolate fall sky.

Halvorsen put human face Cold War. so, happy he's still around. find information looked article. That's asked. say anything easy/difficult long it'll take, compared mRNA vaccines. Masks mass gatherings ""normal"" accept ""mostly normal"" substitute it. cannot wait population vaccinated return normal. hospitals longer risk overwhelmed, happen well 50% vaccinated, restrictions need end. immune response varies time. ""one dose"" timeline soon immune system first ""sees"" antigens, 2nd dose relatively longer after. plus overlapping confidence intervals, slightly different population (not everyone got 2nd dose) get different averages.  yeah numbers clear end February many experts take seriously enough. 

Goes show kind genius Ugur Sahin is, read one Chinese study early January. convinced entire team Biontech switch 100% Covid work weekends (unusual here). think crazy everyone else saying ""we're fine"". weened onto water India able drink it. 

Where get information ? born brought seen many babies family. middle upper middle income groups least bit cautious lower income even care.

Science good backed prejudice becomes tool justify those. never said anything wfhing regards job entails. said “fearless” seen trait don’t want take seriously amount time due looking like weak man men. Maybe doesn’t apply every blue collar worker brothers work, fathers work, uncles work, cousins work, lot others similar mentality. studies men less likely put restrictions sake “risk seeking behavior.” I’m stating observations.

Also, I’m blue collar worker equate simply unskilled hands. Thanks Lol. downvoted again. picture illustrates thing happened NY spring surge, it’s mystery it’s herd immunity amongst population likely get it. Wonder they’ll start opening appts adults even better! Maybe Israel made deal get enough vaccines Jewish people? Israel citizens vaccinated, start shipping countries vaccinating Jewish people first. Would okay? ""I'll pop 9 5 turn"" We’ve gotten lucky many turns... Marketing full glory. might worded comment wrong, meant recent release less sure transmission data. “no shit” comment didn’t make sense since impression didn’t “consensus” prior (understanding pre-print still needs peer review).

This news promising holds true peer review that’s great. white. Damn used condom! I’ve worked cGMP plant pharma scale up. 
There multiple levels regulatory approval: company (QMS), site (site QM record keeping) process approval (process, QMS DMF).
The fact think ‘standardisation’ employed means you’ve got lot learn.
(PS look ‘process scale HPLC affinity chromatography’ see bit complexity involved here.) I'm mostly tired headline readers Fauci's comments attract.

You've got single sentence 3 minute statement everyone taking whole thing. flu long term side effects humans.

Lmao no. Long term flu thing. Covid special way.  I've thought time governments wrong narrowly focus vaccines way this. Mass production high end masks could shut need social distancing, lockdowns isolation now.  know many bought, seem relevant. countries bought American-owned Pfizer Belgium facilitiy first. shared facility.

The EU paid AstraZeneca first 300m doses Belgium facilitiy. That's **no different** UK buying first 100m doses UK, it?  Refuses get vaccine accounting “wait see goes” study you’re citing include figures. Humans social creatures. meant live isolation months time. want stay locked house forever, that's choice. rest us want move on.  types people demand left decide (personal choice not) - yet, preventing people from... leaving decide. 

They clearly believe personal choices. 

They want cause havoc harm. know reality severity virus. want ensure spreads many people possible, people also believe 'thinning herd'. think it'll helpful pharmacies walk-ins too. problem running NY lot people really need vaccine ASAP reduce hospital strain deaths (people 65) nearly internet-savvy younger people included eligible groups snagging appointments. phone line schedule appointments understand absolutely swamped people able get through. think enough supply walk-ins, allow seniors schedule appointment get shots doctor, help ton. Oh mend like celebrities help begins ""Chad"", either... brainer 

You seem experience countries opening fine. Melbourne, lockdowns work, agreed ours...
We've 1000 deaths total, whereas countries weeks since less 1000 deaths day...

They weld people homes... close entrances exits buildings control access.

But initially lockdown 1 person able leave house every 3 days... incredibly harsh... say, interesting, less info then. *months* faster. said dealing thing year recognize *it’s you, it’s everyone*. personal fear virus whatsoever - young healthy. mask up, distance, it’s getting sick, it’s others getting sick. 

If others ilk decide pass good option incremental gain months later, continue spread, continue pandemic, lives lost, businesses harmed, suffering economic distress suffer longer. selfish person try get extra percentage points efficacy. 

It’s maddening people still see together time. work together whole thing ends May/June. Health Care Workers: “Nobody cares us.”

Governors: “These vaccines prevent spread Covid saving millions lives keeping people hospital. high demand right get take first.”

He’s trouble sleeping since got first dose. struggle sleep issues normally anyway, tired yesterday work adding vaccine top it, shocked hard fall asleep. take sleep medicine get close falling asleep exceptionally rare, also slept lightly kept waking night. husband total opposite he’s asleep almost head hits pillow, spent night tossing turning done pretty much constantly since got first dose. something anyone else experienced? get flu shot every year don’t issue definitely wasn’t expecting all.

Two things worry me. might need rely constantly updated mRNA vaccines (and surveillance requires) maintain lasting immunity global south, would logistical nightmare developed world would probably it. enough people refuse vaccine still see limited spread, especially certian areas especially low vaccination rates. scenarios would put serious selective pressure virus evade vaccine increase chances creating new animal reservoirs. would also selective pressure reduce virulence, given incubation period, pressure may less pressure diseases.

Things looking really good short term outcomes, also becoming clear COVID may permanent feature public health planning. wasnt expecting big drop doses administered today (USA) despite winter storm happening Wow, that’s silver lining. Canada real cautionary tale Chinese/ Russian vaccines. they're shown effective, initial worries subsiding, especially places options. real loser Canada, threw lot Chinese vaccine sourcing development, got screwed Chinese trying teach lesson, pretty much last line alternatives.  bleeds leads, disagree fall window People get defensive ask ""wow much tip ask someone risk getting COVID don't?""  states - Florida- ship pharmacies donate Republicans. Governor Death Sentence gave doses Publix, CVS Walgreens... Western biotech companies heavy cyber attack, I’m “surprised” Russian one similar... Vaccine distribution application accelerating US, great news. anywhere else world COVID still raging, starting rage, without vaccination plan secured vaccines, plenty potential mutation. We're going sticky situation internationally quite while. I’m saying schools can’t reopen safely, I’m tired hearing argument black brown low income kids suffering worst, many times quoted white suburban parents want kids well maintained schools low class sizes school 5 days week like wasn’t pandemic. 

I don’t blame parents trusting urban schools maintain covid safe classrooms. Years building neglect, crowded classes, multi generational homes, families likely work come contact covid legitimate reasons why, right now, virtual better kids. No, really. factoring replication process slow mutation rate virus. anything said true we'd super Polio today effective Polio vaccine campaign eliminated disease entirely. tell nobody else touched within last 17 days? tell ever enough infectious? tell person get somewhere else time? California here, though county yet phase 1B- I'll likely present documentation indicating work education. South Dakota around 25% deaths per capita Illinois sparsely populated hellhole ...what?!? That's absolutely absurd. Surprise Wouldn’t smart Biden would start scientific approach understanding long Covid instead relying meta studies? 

We need start following randomized group people get tested see Covid long term consequences Woke! President (Jimothy) Biden? Sorry hear. wish well. Take care talk friends family feel low. r/nottheonion  We’re even group 1 state. got shot trial licensed paramedic?
Bc education similar nursing I'm glad testing could give prompt treatment needed still high. Ideally we'd get back summer really low. mean comfortable sent kids summer camp. way let go anywhere absolutely necessary. Economy must verge collapse, can't think another logical reason this. people starving death rioting vs covid deaths. Sooooo, rub underpants? name Rick Grimes? name Rick Grimes? dentist dentist-adjacent, suppose (or variety healthcare worker matter... Pediatricians probably can't enforce mask wearing practices either). Thank do. We've tried best avoid health care visits, toddlers gonna toddle I'm grateful people like you. Thanks. read article. read another article earlier today, start date. said go website, right indicates nothing Texas. probably like Rick Grimes Walking Dead 😂😂 Ok, stick 'em back paddy wagon put jail trial, can't hurt anybody else. 
Then get convicted put prison several years. IDK that. Deaths COVID exceeded heart disease cancer US. might actually true. LOL true work ems. compare education nursing medic Well, let's hope he's trump fan. Yikes!  Pretty much everywhere looks like cases dropping staying steady. Texas big outlier think that's issue 'things go back normal vulnerable immunized hospital numbers go down' 

Well no.. would risking mutating virus even further. much hate it, need still cautious reach herd immunity. think traces dead virus left surfaces 2 weeks 17 days something like that. Thank giving hope today. Really needed it! know triptans help, bring doctor. look Illinois, 50% deaths per capita California least many restrictions. 328 Days Later 23. Canada also bought them, weren’t allowed fulfilled Pfizer US, EU wants block us well.  Yup, we're going back normal summer. *Old* normal. acting people receive first vaccine pharmacy get second vaccine pharmacy.

I’m saying don’t understand people would comfortable technology familiar with, ultimately getting less effective vaccine. technology new, it’s highly tested superior. utilizing better new technology it’s familiar good reason, even it’s understandable predictable. cheap expensive mean production cost tests voluntary forced citizens? That’s alcohol bad last comment got remove about.... Never go full silly! book online, starting Feb 9th. It’s right article. Sounds like walking dead season 1 episode 1 anyone else find crazy caught COVID once, TWICE coma getting it? 85% reduction serious Covid unqualified success. argument need restore peoples confidence public education system, keeping kids schools.

Queens, Manhattan, BK. 
Many small restaurants crammed tables. Opposite Long Island upstate there's real estate. Glad vaccinated! wish good health. thank learning mustard plasters are. happens get covid? I'm big concerts unless they're something really special, theater museums, really miss. Art museums area generally somewhat reopened, I've one past year, compared maybe dozen (in area others) normal year.  noted work home. I'll say this, put money mouth go infect older relatives. Help spread herd immunity. upvoting you. Moderna straight meat baby.

Injection site soreness days could *use* shoulder next day. Couldn’t sleep days though! everyone stay home spring ppl get vaccinated variants stop spreading jeez 170000 teachers state Florida almost 2.8 million students. pretty much guarantee 37 teachers 9 students die Florida year. Doubt Assuming media acting support government dictating. walks around town shouting HELLO! HELLO! HELLO! 15 minutes? Taking account storage temp effectiveness etc make best overall vaccine date? wish easier. spend day working within 1 foot maskless people it’s worth You’re aware arrested breaking law later time, yes? don’t think high hospitalization rate threat extinction. Millions people chance going hospital. think human race survive one. get appointment? along lines ""stop trying demoralize everyone say 'fuck it!'""

Misery virtue. Celebrating pain hurt others seems counter whole ""save lives,"" ""if saves one life"" mantras continue spew forth subreddit other. true. weeks trying get vaccine appt. finally saw openings hallelujah!!! got doses!!!     Statistically wrong. speaking someone ems transports least 4 covid patients day 12. risk almost even, means I'd ifts 35 year old satting 70 15L, 2 weeks last test negative...or 41 year old transported day home even lightest exertion dipped steady 78 50s partner freaked bit went splotchy lips blued. 

Sure see lot old folks too. two, worst ive seen post recovery, even compared 70+s take back nursing homes recover. 

No risk much less even 1:5000 assure case claim, given population small town work I've observed. least 12 50s I've seen really bad condition town 50,000, that's 1:5000, I'm pretty sure I'm person seeing patients cos I'm one number crews (20+) thing do. 

Sure anecdotal, sort numbers. comparison elderly much total city known population...  Yeah, think ""bad news"" staggering amount physical therapy ahead. Worthy trade-off alive though. redeem life points skip level. don’t trust anything comes scientific designed product. either proof not. don’t, get game. 

Now there’s proof, accept statement given. moderna Pfizer didn’t good quality transparent studies (like Sputnik) can’t state effective proof. quite simple. fame reputation, it’s hard evidence. testing huge inaccuracies discussed. That’s big issue. Unless people cavalier ignoring basic protocols, don’t judge. It’s air borne virus. Medical professionals get it. basic job mitigate- wear mask, keep distance, don’t touch face. things stop transmission- lower rate viral load. 2 million people died. never going back normal.   Joseph: Mate, there’s plague 11 months? Fuck me, comer’ I’ve got avoid gettin’ sick something called COVID.

GP: Actually you’ve already twice

Joseph: DAFUQ? Staph infections contractions also common hospitals. Basically hospitals germfests next public bathrooms person’s mouth anus. Kinda like 28 Days Later, Cillian Murphy’s character slept initial outbreak pandemonium, wake post outbreak getting chased infected. least guy, didn’t become zombies....

Yet...  bit article also says caught covid coma woke up, part people. Also, great look hospital. might transfer parent... friend mine lives Saint Petersburg (no, Florida) got jabbed Sputnik second time recently. first time fever couple days. second time symptoms all.  energy science teacher telling kids reacting cus wearing masks second heard first Covid cases hit country. kept saying didn’t know going happen it’s serious. like schools going close.... right? Yeah kinda aged like milk shit mask mandates, social distancing, person school end vaccinated, amount unseen damage already (definitely needed now) continuing pandemic end near end much damage society doesn’t even attempt make return normalcy. Cool, would nice (or elderly parents NY could get some)! allowed it? summer? never dispersed crowds? Never used flash bangs? Never used tear gas? Never pepper sprayed them? 100% true! one bidet two bathrooms. Everyone fights one bathroom bidet. Seems like time get ordering second one! This. Even #1 Russian fan, can’t “believe” vaccine. protocols follow order ensure I’m stating is. That’s science work. That’s people don’t understand. moderna Pfizer Russia beginning, wouldn’t want take em either. I’m 100% pro vaccination, play chances population. 

It’s SCIENCE. Mate, I'm Australian - live Australia.

Cold weather makes Covid worse way makes Influenza Colds worse - temperature, human behaviour. tend congregate indoors lots people diseases spread easily conditions change behaviour humans change spread disease. 

Oh well getting top Covid, virtually Flu season know anyone caught cold. Personal hygiene, staying-the-fuck home social distancing work. anecdotal, know two people January - one got antibodies test confirm (and nearly died), one milder case never got tested. One happened Disney World January too. wait learns Joe Exotic. Jeeze, people seem hate Fauci. need better tests. PCRs 20% false negatives best day, rapid tests 50/50. best help mitigate spread, basically lowering viral load. unless fitted mask, around stil exposed, lower initial viral load exposure. know actually contract virus mucus membranes eye. sit patio neighbor cough exposed.  


Lets try avoid blaming people contracting virus using normal mitigation efforts- medical professionals also infected. It’s air borne. Reduce exposure, reduce spread, get vaccinated. Viral load initial exposure seems play huge part severe illness be. Mitigate initial exposure- wear mask, wash hands, maintain distance. Give body chance recognize enemy mount appropriate defense. depend tests ‘all clear’- know aren’t accurate.  


I keep 3 month mantra mind- 90 days us access vaccine. Understand vaccines, still feel ‘sick’, way less likely die hospitalized, that’s goal. It’s preventing people headaches body aches, it’s pneumonia ventilators. Perspective important, honestly wish would show body bags people dying news stress difference. 

As Fauci said, transfers, mutates- means less able mount food vaccine response. 

90 days. 

I wear mask day work. allergies, I’m constantly paranoid. allergy Covid again?!?! eat lunch outside... but, 3 months do. wear mask, insist customers do. 

If help anyone, humans need human touch. call ‘butt rub’, stand back back- lot people really alone right now, it’s nice way human connection limited exposure. 

Be Kind
Be Considerate
Care others

It’s different, hard. confirm Covid biggest block ever, least Romantic Stuff. (Texting Girls really hard!) staying home day spring playing replaying Terraria Games, became serious making game. I'd say personally worst. (It ending September would've pretty great though) type things think them, doesn’t make grounded reality beforehand.

I tested negative July COVID antibodies, doubt (at least time), remember infected type virus 2018 forced go hospital night. negative flu -- retrospect, I'm sure *a* coronavirus, *this* coronavirus. EMA approved elderly, AstraZeneca may used excuse supply less vaccines.

I've feeling lately. People thinking goal posts going moved see would, things feel different time. viral exposure immunity lasts 3 months. titers went nil July coronavirus April.  initially skeptical idea COVID January, evidence pointing fact greater infectiousness deadliness might happened Wuhan, definitely super spreader event, certain COVID-19 started necessarily.

I shocked super horrible illness got late December/early January COVID. almost NEVER sick. knocked ass three weeks.  Eh actually press due limited supply healthcare. Problem people seem understand healthcare lot higher viral exposure. Reducing a) keeps rapidly transmitted patients b) keeps healthcare system working without massive loss workers due illness likely worse unprotected healthcare workers virus dose dependent factor. 

It cos thought silly. ppe supplies literally enough. said gen public need to. Healthcare workers wore ppe normally would early times least am. would know hot dog cause anaphylaxis reaction? trying realistic. Sadly US supply N95 masks whole country (which CDC's original recommendation masks, people hoarding N95s keeping health care workers). addition, understand US many manufacturers N95 masks, would taken months either import mask traditional manufacturers (especially every country clamoring them) work domestic companies retool operations make masks make hundreds millions them.

We able quash epidemic like South Korea did, could prevented large spike cases Winter killed many. Lamoooo imagine everyone passes JNJ vaccine, lose summer. see that? limited staff due ths storm time limit second shots, makes sense prioritize second shots first. Madison Square Garden January 30th 6000 people, JFK airport March 13th immigration 🤦‍♂️ I'm fan government... yeah, break makes sense. Everybody needs one.

Not impose export restrictions like US contractual UK. vaccines literally domestic market. I'm county's waitlist, hoping I'll get vaccinated Spring. black people trust vaccine, thus getting it. 

Did read article? 

Seeing heroes get vaccine live television convince large percentage get vaccine. 

But honestly, tell comments people don’t actually care stopping virus would rather people die stick rich people.

The people vulnerable need socially isolate longer, us aren’t going stay like this. Hell, know still go friends even I’m still probably cautious folk people know Covid.

People understand scientific process longer pandered endangering public health.  already starting level hope gets better. need 10 million doses per day get Americans vaccinated mid march. I'm worried [new contagious believed deadly could cause another wave infections lockdowns.  “Could” “if”

Media headlines soon: “Fauci says reinfection booming among healthy young adults” good thing, right? understanding means vaccines rendered useless mutation. one vaccine make sense especially considering effective one. Rick grimes It´s going balancing act countries slowly lift restrictions receive vaccine.  Yeah, kind dumb headline unless expected vaccine completely fail. Wait till gets know guy bullhorns stormed US Captiol two things related. 

People’s bodies adapt environments. 

There Covid environment Indians adapt to, Indians aren’t, like, super humans super powers. 

All people adapt environments. during, after. Lol what. from? Universities schools opened up. one wears mask more. Cinemas opening up. Everything except companies pretty much back normal. Sorry loss hope support needed  come Smiley Face sticker, want appears federal government lost bunch vaccines Trump states slow rollout. work healthcare current vaccination rate 60%. One hospital sitting 30%. valid criticisms russia china this, deployed world soon obvious major issues covered glossed over.

at end day, best scientists world vaccines good look help lot people. give access ""healthcare database"". agreed provide daily aggregates number infected, vaccinated, etc., without providing confidential health data individuals (as required Israeli law), data used identify individuals.

What allowed Israel much willingness share data (which really pretty basic), ability quickly vaccinate majority population, quickly produce data. old. deal made yet. Last Valentines day wife trying talk taking couple days work making long weekend Disney kids. lots points could've done basically cost admission dog boarding...but ultimately decided since taking vacation couple weeks anyway Mexico want shift many points 4 day trip.

When left Mexico, people aware big deal. BIL bit concerned (family trip MIL's 60th birthday) spread around enough huge worry.

When got back week later, buy TP anywhere. lot people sub push idea Covid could spread vaccinated people. believe clinical trials planned younger age groups. they’re obviously pretty low risk group. apparently large canadian pharma industry, since US course bans exports vaccines rely european manufacturers, supplying Europe. largest manufacturers vaccines basically Europe US, vaccines US go whereas European made vaccines go Canada, Israel, Europe third party countries. Theres enough go around right now. get idea vaccinate 30 people per hour? get helping says going put lot resources vaccination. I've seen pharmacy Walmart CVS capable 30 shots per hour. unless expand operations parking lot.  Even besides COVID he's missed rather lot. likely ""other team"" virus adapt generally, population really can't deal news info life likely returning normal coming year TWO hope succeeds, never know. 

CureVac uses low dose effective ingredient. theory, could lead low efficacy; however, guess must know doing.

The great advantage CureVac stored fridge. certainly want people ignoring social distancing claiming vaccinated havn't. 

Would anyone selfish enough so. selfish enough buy faked certificates negative covid19 test. YES, love read poorer countries receiving vaccines well. wish available ourselves, receive shot. Moderna decent. hope get fun trip! sorry loss Putin would like cup tea discuss mistaken trust strange, first delayed moved up? Meanwhile three appointments healthcare providers pushed back 6 15 months. I'm sorry loss. :( Hang there. That's exactly right. Probably written someone works home thinks everyone staying home terrible person. Unfortunately, world continue move. keep working would food stores, fuel vehicles, electricity, etc. I'm sorry losses :(

Man, grieving properly serious repercussions... Lost mother back September car accident, ended dissociating month straight crashed *my* car October. medians get ya! Every single positive case sequenced Denmark moment. ""effective"" mean Russian? far, restrictions lifted allowing non-essential sectors economy reopen (malls, museums, hair care, etc.), maintaining gathering bans (no gatherings private property inside out). Allowing four people gather outdoor activities together long remain 6 feet apart. Curfew remains. 

Local me, camps cancelled well, may March break, parents take hit unsympathetic bosses impossible situations. Legault reevaluate Feb. 22 so, still possible may lift restrictions March Break, far look likely. time athletes would get vaccineses US Europe scheduled done offering vaccines risk groups move goal posts said another post I’m waiting push narrative maintain public health measures peer reviewed studies providing evidence getting vaccinated means transmitting virus... unfortunately half-truths public messaging made incredibly cynical Student, 19, walks church someone sprayed ""THE END FUCKING NIGH"" stairhouse. actually makes comfortable getting vaccines. point able get shot, millions people got several months. able see every single effects vaccine. Lucky-ish Israel really offer vaccines Palestinians citizens vaccinated. Let’s say starting March. 

That means Palestinians get vaccine Europeans. good chunk unvaccinated kids, good bit population. worry stays least. already feel guilty husband vaccinated child won’t able likely another year least. http://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lav2pl/russias_sputnik_v_vaccine_is_916_effective/glrvr9e Actually US pay research development Pfizer vaccine. paid doses, like Canada did.  people get choose vaccine get (at least cases ""The Oxford AstraZeneca researchers also found single dose vaccine 76 percent effective preventing Covid-19."" 

Pfizer Moderna 90 percentiles.

Moderna also shown efficacy mutations.

I guess individual *had* choice, choice would maximizing personal protection maximizing protecting others yourself. I'm pretty sure ""catch"" it....it given him. like parting bros I'll guess 9 million total population also fewer health care workers administer vaccinations. Per head population Israel's health care better job USA's deny everything knew it. say scientist poof, ploblem solved. No, all. geographic term area. anti-irish UK nationalist thing Thats lie. Stop lying. Vaccination probably extended them, FDA requires trials happen pediatric patients give approval kids.

That said, people 16 low risk COVID. focus vaccinating adults around kids- parents teachers, etc. priority first. I'm agreeing you. think article twisted shame young people 'spreading it' likely active world.  that’s nature subreddit. state statistical fact. 15 billion dollars one year good start   work force? Kind obvious. social distance want go work. jobs require social distance.  think OP referring struggles getting vaccinated. Fauci’s position afforded easy access vaccine still folks 1B group fighting get lists. Pcr test   Yeah big deal March. Absolutely nowhere locked year. Back wasn’t long ago.

Undocumented women left detainment centers *sterilized* without consent told getting checkups. year. 

People without power tricked forced life-altering situations changed way culture developed. 

It wonder people color would distrust vaccine. don’t agree taking it, *completely* understand.

I think mentality ‘you go first I’ll take trust it’ now. Kobe

Man. crazy 2020 Kobe's death overshadowed everything else? man whose name say toss paper basket recent death forgot due insanity 2020. far know, evidence saying people get vaccine can't spread (there evidence way people spread it). information known smart people gotten vaccine cautious order support communities. herd immunity reached virus hosts masks necessity. hell said hate guy? like putting words people’s mouths dont ya? 👍

Big difference hate disrespect. already stocking Costco February. Didn’t expect toilet paper issue though. definitely part it, know soon people don’t want wear masks start seeing bunch people wearing got vaccinated don’t know, they’ll think look it’s it’s fine don’t wear anymore New conspiracy incoming: covid used save lives. Yeah kill people woooo! Exactly!!!!! Thanks! Yeah, I'd watch film. zombie films begin. . . Huh?

How giving vaccine black athletes help stop COVID? kind stuff enough actually save it.

Worry workers directly, making people sick propping businesses barely make ends meet normal times. Well.. almost year. heard ure safe couple months. Im still holed cave cant give first hand experience. We're home stretch. Discussion boosters aside, we'll much better shape summer last summer. pneumonia like 3-4 weeks testing positive covid couple different podcasts talking shady medical shit done black people. 

No shit trust establishment. thought same, read times actually understand meant know guy coma three months teenager ended ok. bit pervy...but right rain. impossible really..   US Vaccine Rollout Schedule:

* Dec - March: 220 million doses (120 Pfizer 100 Moderna - 110 million Americans
* April - May: 80M Pfizer doses 
* April - June: 100 million doses Moderna Feb-June: 100 million J&amp;J doses - 100 million Americans  * End March (220M doses; 110M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J
  * End April (\~290M doses; \~145M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J
  * End May (\~370M doses; \~185M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J
  * End June (500M doses; 300M people vaccinated) J&amp;J doses
  * USA 265 million Americans 16 years older 2018)
* include Oxford vaccine could seek approval next month so
* Novavax vaccine pending US phase 3 clinical trials could done end April approval May.
* Depending backend loaded J&amp;J vaccine rollout many Oxford vaccines get, US could give everyone 1st dose beginning May end June. assumes everyone eligible get (I hearing 80% willing), vaccination distribution reaches 3M per day supply issues.
* President Joe Biden said anyone wants vaccine able get one Spring time wants scale 1.5M/vaccinations per day. Week Jan. 25th distribute 8.6 million doses Pfizer Moderna. next week (Feb. 2nd) distribute 10.1 million doses Pfizer Moderna. 15% increase week week.  * US receiving 10 million doses next 3 weeks
  * Moderna increased 4.3 5.8M doses per week (35% increase). rate 85M doses end March  * Pfizer increased 4.3 4.4M doses per week (2% increase). rate 72M doses end March 
  * expect 3 weeks Moderna Pfizer increase weekly doses reach Q1 targets (my opinion) heres must like Yep. Best part? second infection worse people seems antibodies might actually help infection fight body.

People familiar coronavirus immunity saying risk long time mostly treated doomsdayers common vernacular immunology get sick can't get again. fact handful common coronaviruses people catch life, sometimes year. 

The fact even made vaccine works covid19 let alone multiple virus kind amazing, honestly. got hit car brain injury. grateful have. close relative TBI devastating. Seriously, can't even imagine reaction hearing that's happened. Global virus, millions dead, new safety protocols, protests, riots, insurrections, stock market??? Imagine woken right everything opened back COVID longer danger. ""Why everyone awkward sudden?"" Stretch concerned keeping son stabbing people jumping line vaccines. Canada already paid them. idea think would fair EU steal now. wanted more, could've bought companies would've increased capacity. kids lot worry covid...

Read article: kids there, *virtual* classes teachers required teach school rather home. UK authorized delivery UK variant 1/2 many states don’t think ever know person either starts getting better doesn’t. He’s blinking smiling response stimuli takes time see whether regain functions partially, fully, whatever. Serbia really well vaccination numbers, came big surprise me. 

By contrast, Bulgaria (where born) abysmally. hope start ordering Sputnik V gets EU approval. 

Apparently, many Bulgarians would also prefer Russian vaccine American one. Presumably Pfizer Moderna vaccines contain George Soros' microchips. Yup thats banking on. 50/50 vaccine mean 50% chance death googling seems *extremely* rare vaccine 100% effective. Yes, possible permanent damage could totally best thing ever wake to! tone deaf comment.

It’s strange issue. I'm going put amicably possible reply gives impression discussing good faith, appreciate that. 

You better position millions millions people worked hundreds industries dependent Americans able freely go lives spend money choose. Restrictions lockdowns forced upon everyone would typically spend money supporting businesses taken away ability support themselves. Someone forced decision negatively affected everything lives. Whether mentally, physically, emotionally, financially, people going unprecedented crises name ""Covid safety"".

Whether know not, work remotely 100% time, still thousands people physically go work make possible you. Delivery drivers. Utility workers. Factory workers. Law enforcement/emergency services. Plumbers, electricians, tradesmen kinds. Infrastructure management. Healthcare workers. list endless. matter get stay home not, that's cards millions US. 

You're forced go office everyday. quit job. feel safe going in, it. quit. would make feel safe, right? situation millions others lost jobs restrictions lockdowns put place guise safety. Safety wanted. Safety feel attainable everyone staying home, *staying safe*. 

There's question Covid deadly virus, small portion population. Instead blanket lockdowns restrictions affect entirety population, focused protection actually risk here. damage done ""protect"" society response virus vastly outweighs benefits. Sadly, no. peaks valleys driven congregation travel traditions. US peak travel congregation around Christmas New Year holidays. Asia, Chinese New Year.

This year addition ongoing Covid pandemic spot year ago several Covid+ pandemics. handful confirmed cases scattered about, replicating community becoming endemic caused handful deaths yet.

With Spanish Flu second year much worse. second wave took hale young, first preferred old frail. contribution security guard tap screen ticket machine. actually good idea, infection-wise. doubt it, maybe END summer. You’re really going stereotype Americans based one troll Reddit? Lol

Yeah - Ireland need immunity due common travel area. can't ""COVID border"" island Ireland. vaccines shown safe esch really. safety concerns either one. guess technically could say mRNA vaccines ""better"" get since we've seen they're efficient like 95% efficiency higher efficiency J&amp;J AZ. 

But honestly right one refusing whatever vaccine they're offererd. Whilst AZ etc less efficient say pfizer/moderna keep people hospital even develop symptoms would likely minor symptoms. covid covid headline damn realistic. Ugh. Times Israel acceptable source Israeli-Palestinian relations.

Nice. Teachers nurses pretty important right now. really politics. ""When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent.

South Dakota 6th deaths/capita, 3/6 states ahead (MA, NY, NJ) states got hit hard March idea doing. That's pretty bad. Florida better though. Wisconsin: getting COVID surge

Also Wisconsin: Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme someone living South Florida, think state good job overall. Like people said, lockdowns delayed numbers early on, seems overall case death numbers always inevitable. 

Florida largely mocked whole thing. First closing enough businesses beginning opening soon. look total numbers, especially cases per million residents, state well. Especially factor lack restrictions high number elderly. outside areas can't social distance, they're saying hike mask on. Here's informative take it: Exactly, FDA requirement process often different many ways, even EU data solid can't transfer one wish wonder actual true intentions were. 

She part party opposed stem cells - so, advocate / solicit cure? Furthermore, GOP ignoring severity COVID - advocate / solicit cure? 

Is looking make money this? mean, would smarter legitimate ways pull goal off. feels intentional way.. kind condescending behavior people ""understand science"" exactly lead people hating everything connected ""science"" see. consequently antivaxers conspiracy theorists.

If smart, try thinking effect saying say it. not, ready responsibility smart monkey. “but she’s 75” people— yes that’s true, plenty 75+ people still lists waiting US even though they’re eligible, they’re still weeks away getting first dose.

There evidence supporting efficacy AZ vaccine elderly weak trusted.

Honestly cant understand points theres much point discussing further.  Yes governments around world want economy crash. Turns hate economy well sincr makes people support more. 

Also new variants mean pandemic end. we've seen existing vaccines still work new variants albeit slightly reduced efficiency. highly unlikely new variant totally mwke vaccines useless. existing vaccines still good enough end pandemic return normality may need get vaccinated boost immunity new variants. flu already requires annual vaccine. Although probably much thr flu So? whatever want long they're *more* safe necessary hurting anyone. idiots insist *less* safe necessary problems. honestly understand Florida getting completely destroyed age biggest risk factor. Based this, uncontrolled spread would think places like Villages would point people would dying streets, especially since many people tend politically aligned anti-lockdown side things. wonder Florida getting easily higher temperatures factor there. seems like smart person. people like Dolly Parton probably would mess.

Israel charge flu shots, Israel violating international law assuming control public health Palestine. Currently, public health Palestine controlled Palestine's government de facto, de jure Israel actually heading due Palestine saying cannot handle pandemic.

LONDON (Reuters) - UK variant coronavirus developed new, concerning mutation small number cases, scientists said makes similar South African Brazilian variants could reduce efficacy vaccines.

The emergence mutation variant first discovered Britain highlights complicated exiting COVID-19 lockdown even vaccines rolled out.

Public Health England said 11 reports UK variant feature E484K mutation, mostly south-west England.

The E484K mutation, occurs spike protein virus, change seen South African Brazilian variants caused international concern.

""PHE monitoring situation closely necessary public health interventions undertaken, including enhanced contact tracing control measures,"" PHE spokesman said.

Several laboratory studies found vaccines antibody therapy significantly less effective South African variant.

By contrast, early evidence showed vaccines worked well UK variant, originally E484K mutation.

Health minister Matt Hancock said early tell impact variants vaccines, mutations concern reported Bristol Liverpool.

""We must continue act caution, least renewed challenges posed new variants coronavirus,"" told lawmakers.

Calum Semple, part panel advises British government, told BBC radio E484K ""mutation concern"", ""occurred spontaneously"" UK variant.

Concern South African variant, E484K mutation, already prompted authorities England begin door-to-door mass testing drive areas cases variant found people link South Africa, mandatory quarantine hotels arrivals South Africa yet come force.

Though number reported cases UK variant concerning mutation small, scientists said demonstrated Britain's high prevalence cases meant enough simply prevent new variants imported.

""This report would seem suggest conditions high levels virus replication even stringent border controls, although may delay spread, unlikely prevent appearance new variants,"" said Jonathan Stoye, virologist Francis Crick Institute People actual idea fatal is.

If virus mutate enough completely evade vaccine, would probably change much would longer able infect people all. ""Much safer"". 100% safe state community spread rampant. That's point article. going around r/coronavirus today arguing restrictions outdoor environment, even face face. 

You play odds game covid go meeting new people face face maskless. odds better area low incidence rates. Arizona low incidence rates. fact high incidence rates. meeting 'new' friends socialize safe outdoors.

It's amusing though people believe can't get covid sitting around table talking strangers outside. Much USA joke contact tracing apparatus sharing specifics people end infected. mystery people get infected. get infected talking people table outdoors hour plus.

You also plenty people covid going despite knowing it. They'll feel little better testing positive go since get groceries, go appointments, meet new friends, etc. knew thing abstract realized lot common personally knew people this. 

two big reasons.

1. transmission rate would need REALLY low (which seem case vaccine), number infected people community would need somewhat low. Otherwise, vaccinated people would still contribute spread. thus, likely need lag even vaccinated people need mask order drive total transmission rate (vaccinated unvaccinated people).

2. soon ok vaccinated people stop wearing mask, nobody wear mask. people like masks anyway, unvaccinated X% population would stop wearing them, use justification found internet feel good, even they're causing spread increase ignoring social distancing masking. 

So, ask yourself: transmission rate vaccinated people, percentage population needs vaccinated, go ahead tell everyone stop wearing masks (vaccinated unvaccinated), effectively going happen. typical American never take responsibility. Let guess? gonna blame Russia China instead yourself?

How nice must act like Trump never happened pretend America perfect government foreign entity rather voted people. still system keep refuse change. like it? anything it?  death rate 8% kids you, everyone else, would taken lot seriously jump. Legislators/governors would DEMANDED *effective* lockdowns DPA make masks PPE citizens, funding stay home, America would’ve probably incredible response virus. Prisoners politics. literally wards state, close proximity, generally bad air flow, communal facilities.

They can't exactly practice social distancing. Chernobyl fall Okay got vaccine, specifically, got virus created antibodies mean can't get reinfected even transmit it. Correct? population around 100 million 1918... fatality rate today would put us near 3mil deaths. That's choice end. one else's business citizens. Lol. trying get people take vaccine. admitted interview reported herd immunity thresholds based actually believes, rather thinks encourage people get vaccine. good enough americans, sure hell good enough them. Yeah, that's going change result this. Tuesday announced Canada start repatriate vaccine production. Hard lesson. mean? 70-85% country even qualify current vaccinations? What, gonna wait another year 12 year olds get vaxxed same, risk seasonal flu? beyond absurd point.

Beyond vaccination, normalcy held heads bargaining chip. vaccinated, need get live life fullest extent. Take normalcy back, wait it. another sense, could say full vaccination U.S. 5% completion. american news already talking virus mutations? Cause europe sure doesnt look good all. really. 75+ eligible like 2 weeks. He's selfish prick even healthcare workers done yet. Utah same. even took pharmacies. State something like 98% utilization, Walgreens CVS around 8%. state took distributed them, used instead thrown out. published Lancet arguably prestigious medical journal world, I'd take offered me. anyone? Swaziland? Damn. No, like flu. tune every year. wait Yeah let take time, like they're gonna make much money Xavier Magneto? There's lot conflicting and/or incomplete legitimate scientific information COVID-19 too. careful letting someone else decide misinformation. Yeah, that's guess. Combined annual vaccine. team nets, dart guns, roaming around hardware, looking intransigents. wonder he’ll realize that’s virtual impossibility anywhere US. exodus entertainment business begins state go Texas he’ll change tune  Yeah headline meant evoke uniform group.

There doctors - overwhelmingly favour vaccine, bumwipers, mean nurses, smart woulda become doctors. Yeah like restrictions restaurant capacity pre-herd immunity measles failed it. funds vaccine efforts. enthusiastic supporter. long line 75+. skipping front.

And waiting prudent. Don’t feel bad. whole process ridiculous. Guilt tripping healthy people moving smokers fat people front line. shame healthy wanting suffer horrible effects covid. No, chances pretty good effective, data. know Oxford improved effectiveness 62% 82% extending time gap 3 months, See might due vector immunity problem, Pfizer really unlikely 3 weeks optimal time gap, every vaccine given 3-6 months apart. 3-4 weeks chosen Covid world cannot afford wait trials takes months get started. New Zealand probably borders closed throughout 2022 23 Yup, return normal happen public opinion makes happen. ideally, since I’ve isolating alongside needs taken care of, I’ve also exposed, though haven’t showed symptoms yet. good person. stuff comes keeps lot good wraps.

I feel weird saying this, Dolly Parton national treasure. Jeez talk brainwashed, looney toon  not. Flu influenza Coronavirus. Spanish Flu killed 5-800,000 Americans two years Covid looks surpass far. modern medicine accurately track that, genome sequencing. Modern analysis treatment able hold death toll overwhelm healthcare system. Epidemiology come long way.

And yet, are. 458,715 dead Americans today. Less year since first death confirmed. They’re absolutely trolling shitposting nonstop. Literally AITA posts removed they’re fake AF. Don’t feed troll, guys. Seriously. Got data anecdotes? Death rate higher flu starting 30s 40s. get 20s younger, lower flu. There's rush anything... West Virginia still restrictions, schools back in, stores aren’t counting capacity anymore, restaurants 75%, etc. Mask compliance pretty high. Nursing homes received first shots. 

I think you’re correct. mid-spring, restrictions lifted.  cares got virus fight. deal years every soul planet vaccinated
(According redditors) Fair enough. tend agree tipping point.

The thing is, decent chunk population get vaccinated. people quit jobs require it, etc.

I think battle going back normal, need precautions protect anti-vax people.

Now, me, everyone opportunity get vaccine, think things need move significantly towards going back normal.

Here's another variable, industries wiped covid...some people actually living better. Working home enjoying it. Getting extra gov stim. Saving buy gas drive. seems weird, people actually probably like pandemic aspects mentioned. ie 100% clearcut everyone wants go back normal. think memes - Vaccinated Chad vs Antivax Virgin? Isn’t Tom Hanks closing year? Agreed. like Fauci really irresponsible say. assumed meant confirmed 6 months still studying media needs help get right now. don’t know didn’t include “at least.” expect situation getting better EU thanks vaccines? feels like world moving on, EU stagnant... I’ve argued before. come conclusion taking modern vaccines dangerous health invasion privacy. vaccine harm body mind along injecting kind tracking technology somehow change thoughts.

So perspective, people wanting vaccine ignorant people become universally screwed. Imagine Christian atheist country Satan revealed people everyone lined sign contract souls... better USA Today.

Are *really*, though? Yay! get scheduled? grandma Clackamas county 80s I'm trying get info avail. calling Dr weekly new info :/  ok? lol 70% 85% US population fully vaccinated Covid-19 country begin return sense normalcy, Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN Tuesday night.

That completely absurd me. go hospitalizations deaths instead? soon one contracts Covid, long person able spread it? immediate? fester bit first able spread it? headline/article accurately quoted Fauci. blame media? past months Fauci said needed combination infections immunizations achieve herd immunity. Fauci saying need 7 85% immunizations video even mention infections. 

He's changed message. wonder why. wrong thing good way make appear right thing. :) Let's clear: lost jobs companies laid without kind support pay. government offer support pay (outside unemployment, complicated depending point talking about, state).

A lot livelihoods continued middle pandemic. think concerts going on? Answer honestly. 

What alternative? ""Zero COVID"" madness.  I’m worried variants. vaccines cover original strains right? guess smart people worked original strain working variants so....that’s solid news. Smart people! Yay! headline reflects Fauci said 0:38 video. Winnipeg January, yep, cold fuck. That's often called Winterpeg. friends parents haven’t seen baby (their first grandchild) least two half see him. Dutch can’t spend 2 weeks vacation locked quarantine.

I know rules make sense human costs can’t ignored. That’s one small one. Yet, I'm wary mutations going way terms vaccine efficacy, that's pessimism. Hard drown people actively winning Darwin awards. saw major resurgence outside specific neighborhoods hit April. India close herd immunity, spreads certain areas populations stops, starts spreading areas populations. kind reason herd immunity crappy strategy overall, bounce population population spread always lopsided. Look numbers North South Dakota, nothing, major spike, back nothing again. genome virus sequenced, vaccine designed like 2 days. Everything manufacturing testing. 

This really incredible achievement. easy forget fast really given desperately need vaccine effective vaccines ready use public within year virus existing great. I'd say good case study happens people private businesses freedom make safety/health decisions instead decisions forced upon them. sounds like complaint really PPP enhanced EI etc. holes fixed. agree. stop whining. That's sort work now, got similar guidance. depressing TBH. I'm back lab nobody talks anyone anymore, water cooler conversation gone, everyone's stares ground, etc. Exactly. f*ked together EU vaccine sitation. Feels like never ending story. hear 4 square block area. one died either things arent mutually exclusive reason venture comments section subreddit. nonstop trash. People trials infections early days, based timing safe assume infected vaccination, problems.

In cases infection vaccination happened around time, chance vaccine ""out-race"" infection prevent symptoms. know incubation period [is 7.7 days people start get antibodies around first week, partial protection possible cases. Post-exposure vaccination associated rabies tetanus, circumstances might work Covid. goes CNN “don’t go back normal til everyone vaccinated” mess... assume people aren’t gonna follow CNN touch organization??? Like hell get vaccinated get back normal... Deaths hospitalizations. Moderate severe COVID19 still putting long lasting complications people Welp. Looks like ""zero covid"" ""back normal"" tier then. hoped be.

Sucks industries open 2023. They'll dead CA move elsewhere can. CA's dominance music festival market fun lasted guess.  even close. Nurses, doctors, people administering vaccine, care home staff, anyone serious health condition puts high risk people 60 getting vaccine right now. 

Giving teachers, prisoners, frontline workers absolutely politics. states either giving pressure unions, trying reward certain groups, trying paint certain light.

The virus kills almost solely age alone, vaccines administered oldest youngest limited exceptions. that’s case, I’ve normal since summer. EU isn’t producing vaccines. private company set manufacturing plant EU producing it. vaccines belong private company producing it. go whoever private company contracted with. idea EU “owns” vaccine produced EU plant dangerous fallacy. He's knighted, Sir Tom now. RIP. developed country still can’t quite get hang basic social distancing rules... set standard would likely take rigorous testing masks ability stop airborne virus would inevitably reveal don’t stop airborne viruses all. Welp warned us pandemic started, danger virus mutating. stopping spreading sooo important months get right. countries smashed it, others failed leaders lot answer for. Vaccines saving grace wont save poor leadership challenging situation weve faced globally. work Walmart. short meeting week two ago store may vaccine end February early March. pumped! one favourite comments ever, thank you!  nice. mean it’s expensive compared increased transmissions? restaurants owners aren’t paying medical bills lol Sounds like Korea - we've done pretty solid job keeping large-scale outbreak bay gonna hot minute start seeing regular folks getting vaccinated.

Good luck Olympics all! one part. virus tiny (8 kilobyte?) chain RNA protein shell. Howdy neighbor, Polk county here...Small world!!

He caught TWICE? it’s Australian article, they’ve squat-all cases...
Oh he’s British caught uk. 
Surprised got twice, then. ""sir prescription juul pods thanks"" god wish counter story, got September able continue running normally 10 days later. Anecdotally, 6+ friends gotten perfectly fine since. early 20’s. It’s different everyone.    Schools 100% normal places Sept. Maybe end 2021-2022 school year, start. yoooooo starve death lot quicker that, believe yourself. joking crazy assumed happen. We’re seeing infections dropping like stone UK. completely unscientific belief vaccination care home health care workers seen massive benefits breaking infection transmission. turn see step change hospital admissions people admitted causes greatly reduced risk contracting hospital. politicians get decide many worth sacrificing good economy? hospital really long time, hard understand? airborne.  Sorry loss. Beside covid19 highly contagious viruses, Old people usually fall septic urinary tracrt infection, pneumonia infections.. always look one admitted hospital falls extremely well summer regular distancing (probably lots masks).  Unlike island countries, never tried fully eliminate it. national government essentially done nothing start.

They've found ""worrisome"" strains there. Replaced who? must sign though. recovers, Covid's over! done. US politicians lack political backbone it. fundamentally problem US pandemic response. 

Canada CERB first wave: gave everyone laid 2000/months. government paid 90 percent non-payroll fixed cost business (rent, mortgage, city taxes)

In second wave eliminated CERB kept subsidizing business's covering 90 percent fixed costs, instead covered payroll 75 percent normal. Allowing people basically go home collect 2/3 salary. Family members wanting see loved one. spread covid :! fucking trip man  different variants really don’t blame feeling that. Feel CA especially Bay Area. truly concerned things won’t normal years targets keep shifting (vaccinate majority, vaccinate kids, vaccinate variants...). 

Our state leadership CA joke - despite keeping businesses closed year one worst cases wise one worst terms % people vaccinated. There's large percentage morons get vaccinated too. Vaccine 10% got first dose even smaller 3% got doses? thought supposed sLoW SpReAd. favor lockdown fact applaud opening looking back lockdowns look like complete farce. understand lockdown April know hell expect continue fear mongering almost year? cripple economy, people get evicted, bankruptcies, unemployment? seeing restaurant today full capacity January deadliest month pandemic whole thing makes sense. Right. That's already almost one three people. pandemic winding then, things open. really matter anyone walk rgr corner get shot day. So? Virus mutations expected anyways. nothing done prevent them. inevitable.

After one entire year living fear isolation, elderly finally go live last years/months/weeks/days Earth fullest...and want take away herd immunity reached (IF reached first place)?

Don't heartless selfish. feel like masks won’t completely go away. Especially among elderly immune compromised. full eye research - clean. Neuro diagnostics, brain MRI - clean. found (exact) symptoms experience connected food triggers.

Sometimes directly 20 minutes - i.e. cashew nuts
Sometimes next day day eat - milk, carrots, tons others

The biggest difference tried put away gluten - week 60% vision symptoms went away

The 40% triggered histamine + specific food allergies

NEVER food allergies before. recommend run full panel immunologist. Daily write downs didnt help consider carrot celery problem. was.

Now much better condition. 8 months progress, could barely walk 200m. realizing connected food back 70% even go running now.

Also purposefully try food newly alergic order train immune system. way bad next day big problem know debilitating symptoms coming from.

In one one word: Fooooooooooood
I like 80 symptoms day. really don’t see can’t go back 2019 really? Personally lifelong native new yorker want say this:

This Cuomo move. I'm glad others outside NYC getting chance see this. Early pandemic (between Jan March) Cuomo knew dire situation initially blamed DeBlasio Trump gave public speech assure things done weren't. Recently Cuomo said reopen indoor dining, day. say say first said subreddit, met dissent members sub. Now, hope eyes open, say near certainty run president, pray everyone learn mistakes here. interest, reference (not doubting, interested)? makes sense, long don’t think trust Russia China. goal destabilize world elites rule despotically, country. wait British American vaccine. really. true vaccines still highly effective preventing severe disease death even South Africa variant, huge decrease vaccine efficacy (which based getting infected) around 90% around also true, mask strategy unserious. Make N95s tell people wear instead cloth masks. sure change Surviving recovering. [Life imitates Isn’t “The Walking Dead” opened up? thing middle ground. problem politicians take steps necessary get middle ground.

Lockdowns emergency measure. avoid lockdown act early. wait long lockdowns either become inevitable risk unnecessary deaths triage healthcare system. 

This something I'm noticing around world pandemic. Politicans receive advise put moderate measures early ignore fearing voter backlash act early. shit hits fan fear voter backlash overwhelmed hosptials turn option available: lockdowns. reopen things early, cases rise again. 

A good contrast province (BC) home province (Alberta). provinces roughly similarish population, BC case population mostly packed Lower Mainland (Vancouver + Suburbs).

Alberta delagated powers Chief Medical Officer Health needs get Premier Cabinet agree restrictiions. BC given Cheif Medical Officer authority act independently. CMO basically felt right time felt right.

In BC second lockdown. go shopping, eat restaurant, drink 1000 bar even go gym (just fitness class).

But required us act early. September cases started rising put measures contain virus. closed high risk businesses virus spreading rapidly (banquet halls nightclubs) contained regularddb businesses virus significant spread (no fitness classes).

By contrast day measures announced, Priemer Alberta mocked saying ""micromanaging businesses"". shit hit fan, tried late, lockdown.

Interestingly, despite worrying voter backlash. Alberta priemer least popular Canada, BC priemer popular. top economic damage BC negligible, actually grew last quarter. 

It's every issue I'm noticing globally politicians drag feet voters might get angey. things get bad go extreme measures that's option left. maximizing pain providing little gain. dogs go heaven.

Laika got head start. People following rules guidelines busses, metros public places.. Yeah, friend's elderly father recently went (ambulance ride) low blood pressure due various issues, treated successfully, recovery, suddenly ""untreatable pneumonia"" high fever. Hoping Covid. talked mom believes gonna several years

i really can't fucking anymore

much less fucking distancing purposefully depriving human contact

id give final decade life end tomorrow

fuck i'd give final two decades vaccine economy cannot stand another lockdown. 

Once elderly people vaccinated, death rate drop point deaths certain age prominent ones yet statistically relevant enough warrant new restrictions.

The elderly die point vaccinated seen reasonable sacrifices politicians. really anything President is, vaccines + lockdown fatigue. Haha, NatGeo already working documentary prior March 2020, right? \*very\* touch think even 1% Americans would recognized name prior last March. kids got unbelievably sick late December, hung mid-January. point, 7 year old ever dr., besides well checks, once, ear infection. daughter urgent care twice, ER once, pediatrician once, span less month. sicker I'd ever seen them. Lethargic, wheezing, coughing, fevers. docs kept telling ride out. Treat symptoms. Tested negative influenza host ailments. Now, really wonder COVID-19.  states saying add doses Pfizer Moderna Novavax johnson USA population concerns well. live CA believe majority population vaccinated target shift must vaccinate kids we’re safe mutated virus. don’t believe reopen fully drive cliff. Considering cutting loses moving... rather take chances virus waste years sitting home. Similar me. ideal Japan that’s happening. Second Iceland UK (feasible). Third Canada. Fourth go Maine Vermont drive around Dude, American cops. believe covid thing. Goodbye, Lenin! Yes, selfish, wont happen imo. Way complicated serious vaccinations well truly happening now. mRNA treatments already starting entering trials 2019. pandemic definitely accelerated rollout, blue. wait - gets better:

Derges, assistant physician got medical degree Caribbean Medical University Curacao May 2014, allegedly gave treatments herself.

Top notch education display. Wonder degree honorary? good compilation Fauci's many ""I'm lying keep safe"" statements. Happy cake day way! EU ordered 80 Million doses 1Q really care crowds anyways, think ""back 
normal"", care able go DM's house friends sit circle breathing other. That's normal. wearing mask public rest days. started mask wearing 3 years ago due immunocompromised. everyone else returns normal still normal. hope violence doesnt increase people understand still wearing mask. honestly considering wearing lanyard says immunocompromised hopes people read little understanding. wish could return maskless public outings everyone else thats reality. point happy return masked public outings fully vaccinated. Let's real past year definitely felt like simulation/shitty hyperealistic VR experience Same. American police fluctuate insanely light covid actively anti-mask anti-vax covid-is-a-hoaxers. country, people get Sinopharm, almost half million people got it.

But people still mix Sinovac, it’s efficacy.  country need zero case, poor person coma gets virus twice let happen Sounds good me. ? happened one time far. closed 30 minutes unexpected misinformation. vaccines 100% effective hospitalizations deaths currently circulating variants. So, knowledge COVID? Like conservatives meet public? 1st March. know UK, US (&amp; specifically WA NY) 1st COVID-19 death life functioning 2019 part. No-one immediate circles preparing. life, start seeing masks community college campus till 9th right spring break, &amp; even 2 day many hundreds people would cross campus hours. went normal life 8th 'is world ending? everything's shutting &amp; we're scared' mood 14th. Looking back, fast everything changed amazingly scary. guess power exponential growth. morning 11th evening 13th surreal hours. took one dead scientist get done!  Thank you! first US case hour me. get point completely forgetting standards changed since past. shock come lockdowns going result mental economic implications last years least. People lost livelihoods due lost job opportunities, laid deprived fundamental aspect human nature socialization. Yes living WW2 , used minimize obvious negative impact lockdowns people. fact matter , mental health talked enough , rather quite opposite. truth mental economic fallout restrictions going far outweigh direct consequences pandemic It’s really kids worry about, it’s parents. 
So many parents take kids play dates households, birthday parties, going trips...and teachers find kids mention assignment “what weekend,” whatever...

These parents mixing around people, first ones send kids back it’s time open up. (They’re also ones never follow carpool rules, etc.)

Over thanksgiving &amp; Christmas break, parents told school report going travel state &amp; also possible exposure. several report, again, teachers found students told teachers awesome trip see grandma Florida. Get Vaccine, pick 75'' Vizio less $600 bucks, groceries, bam successful shopping trip. That's sometimes ""listen science"" seems little...simplistic? mean, science can't guide morality. part science looking n-order consequences, medical data. Economic psychological research form science too, albeit much harder replicate medical research. 

You use science weave narratives suit want to, people know difference. 

These nuances totally lost ""trust science"" phrase. paralyzed nose down, lived ICU couple months learned eat again, walk again, breathe again, etc. lasting effects gait posture, sure that's long immobilized ICU, following PT OT properly. 😂 genuinely psychotic still trying justify theft. pure selfishness, decided OK Canadian's die result theft long countrymen get vaccines. literally empathy?

Canada subsidised factories too, subsidised research too, paid vaccines - right share vaccines EU. Sigh. Yeah, lawsuits really draining, point better let things go experience 7 years stress.

 case like this, would find lawyer willing work contingency. That's get paid percentage money that's awarded. get paid win, percentages charge huge, like 30%-50% award. usually want big firm case like this.

You might also look filing complaint something like local medical board. I'm sure much good would do, might bad thing least case recorded officially somewhere. might something enough complaints might add action.

Coronaviruses don’t mutate readily flu, regardless, flu example virus strategies avoid immunity. Vaccines done make worse, virus evolve avoid immunity. Vaccines give us immunity, isn’t evolving avoid vaccines, avoiding immune response. widespread immunity doesn’t get rewarded evolving avoid immunity. Now, 1/3 people Covid, vaccine taking us full herd immunity hopefully summer, virus need find ways around immunity. almost exact scenario happened one Lincoln Project ad videos Slight differences there, terrifyingly uncanny similar are. yeah are, there’s many people working India, China, Africa continue rapid development pace, think start hitting breakthroughs fast. Starlink could huge catalyst went ER post covid palpatations super high bp freaked out.

It maddening much discussion completely shut down, much key facts (Slaughter taking place nursing homes, actual specific places transmission) obscured early continuously.

I’m optometrist Queensland Australia. public hospitals shut non-urgent clinics, including ophthalmology (obviously apart emergency cases), months, back first went lock-down.  grandpa’s story exactly it!

Hugging handshakes come back. think southern neighbor, Mexico, included list. Yeah, really good line single dose efficacy numbers J&amp;J (72%) preliminary numbers Sputnik V (73 - 85%). yup agree, messaging poor start.in opinion would better trumpeting effective vaccines reducing hospitalization levels, horrible scenes hospitals overrun likely avoided mass vaccinate healthcare system less stressed effective treatment given patients would still hospitalized.

my guess it’s combination trying capitalize new variants headlines recently, well believe vaccination reduce community spread significantly should, don’t complete data yet last thing new administration wants tell people take masks find wrong vaccinated people’s spreading.

i agree though messaging poor since day 1, always feels like they’re telling us halve truths hiding half us believing handle whole truth whatever reason, done erode trust. Good news get approved major production April Lol really far fetched? Nurses staff multiple times day - physically touching - hospital. treated like children

You're right, sad. However equally sad fact one thing last year proved significant proportion population behave like spoiled children. messaging largely aimed lowest common denominator. bit early say really. study published yet, one vaccines eliminate transmission (I'm waiting hear much transmission reduced by).

But positive news. expectation vaccines considerably reduce transmissibility, first real confirmation. Country actually cares citizens. Even outside pandemic negative headlines generate clicks. yeah lot older people vaccinated, even get probably get supersick anyway, bring death rates massively down. thought reason restrictions, wanted protect hospitals. maybe reason? Maybe EU tried get cheaper deal pharma companys think they're entitled let citizens die decide whether save 20% quick euros huh? Nah, must UKs fault. reality fact based posts downvoted anyways Edit: Juneteenth Unlike western world, India seems hoarding pile vaccines. country sending % doses pile poor well neighbouring countries. per last news country gradually scaling vaccination capacity, issues online vaccine registration platform. mind bureaucracy massive experience mega scale polio vaccination unlike country. yeah.

Associates dispense prescriptions, deal. return normal happen deaths low, necessarily herd immunity Yeah get directly 4chan, usually go :-)

I think Bats South America different strains coronaviruses one China imported South American bats, would quickly spread bats new introduction.

I remember got from... quite ago... Hope get friend! weren’t restrictions.  That’s hell gap year I'm arguing number low, compared vaccines available right now. disagree ""does virtually nothing stop transmission"" true - anything gives form immunity better nothing. 

Additionally, stopping infection stopping transmission still two separate things heavily debated general consensus currently vaccination reduce transmission much we'd like.

Not saying played cards better, absence alternative guarantee one coming soon (back August) something par seasonal flu jab effectiveness-wise sounds pretty good.

If ever time sides put politics aside global pandemic. Oh favour mandatory masking policy for, say two months majority population vaccinated. think safety measures maintained 

What meant given nature virus, people *still* continue die foreseeable future, large part people gonna get vaccine never will, saying it’s confine ruin life theoretically forever “protect” subset population dense ill-informed get vaccine. people continue die covid society gonna accept that’s fact life now, much like way people die flu every year. way change would making vaccinations mandatory Bc lazy ass dirty germ spreading “healthcare” workers spread disease around like candy. home town Walmart giving vaccinations speed things lot. 4700 stores US, could vaccinate 30 people hour that's 2.2 million every day operate 16 hours. That's 60 million people 30 days. sub denied reinfections since beginning.

_goes back sleep another year_ Herd immunity really happen natural infection*.

As proportion resistant population increases, R0 falls towards 1 new infections tail - sure - there's constant reduction resistant population (births deaths), R0 really hammered far 1 vulnerable serious disease confidently protected.

*I'm happy proven wrong, I've yet found example herd immunity gained natural infection alone - instead diseases become endemic. Perhaps could happen seasonal flu there's natural seasonal reduction R0 spring summer, although course, also vaccinate seasonal flu.

Here's easy read many, many, many studies posted sub last almost year mask-wearing masks best. many, one time, people complained comments ""we know already. mask studies allowed stay up.""

Bc, no, unless cloth mask 3 layers working well deserve. 3 layer cloth masks work well surgical masks, buy FDA-approved true surgical mask, better 3 layer cloth mask. luxury working home, throwing one two! go shopping going kill you.

Misrepresenting likely outcome _is science._ Assuming something negative scientifically likely must always headlines _definitely_ science. fact new types vaccines _isn't even relevant_ fundamental biology exact same.

The science says ""We enough data know yet every single prior information says vaccines reduce transmission."" That's reported. ""VACCINES AFFECT TRANSMISSION."" even ""VACCINES MAY AFFECT TRANSMISSION."" _only_ accurate representation ""Vaccines likely reduce transmission, data needed"" headline intentional clickbait. remember reading interview Cathedral 90s talking weird touring Japan crowds anyway.

That's state population concentrated one main area.

One would say people like held accountable actions. really affect people edge already things would want normal circumstances. Reddit neutral source finally see end hopefully gets better on.

This common assumption, wishful thinking. Deaths dropping exactly like expected would cases started dropping two three weeks ago. Deaths track infections.

The cases started dropping two three weeks ago vaccinations happening (there enough people vaccinated yet) case level spike due holiday season end 2020.

Sorry bearer bad news, we're woods yet. number infected dead could still increase again, depending lot things. 

That's scientists encouraging government speed vaccinations, get ahead curve time new variants become wide spread people immune, make future spikes less severe making portion people exposed get infected.

The new variants coming, though, get unlucky government wrong thing, could make things bad. wait see. mean blame people least bit skepitcal Putin's regime? throughout 2020 suppressing Russian scientists, even mysteriously falling windows. Maybe could pay people stay home via stimulus spending risk lives rich NYCers dinner favorite spot? also, regardless whatever cuomo says, know one itching able eat inside folks city. sub fooled. Well even vaccine, variants present risk...1/10th less effective cases. probably never going risk free, neither life. get it. like staying home wasting years life. Doesn’t mean live like you. remember flu? virus causes mild flu today virus caused Spanish flu outbreak

Once we've dealing COVID century, getting it/being vaccinated, talk comparison. Awww. I’m sorry hear that. Feel free message you’re bored lonely need talk. Sending hug. get this. :) measure think gone far? plan contain virus? I’m serious it’s complicated want know think. remember gorilla killed....well... still zero idea common is. Estimates range 2% 20%. cases put together really debalitating situations one non specific symptom.  know, many seem forgetting many Pfizer doses, example, made EU exported UK. Would like EU actually decide take vaccine nationalism route? EU simply decided vaccinate adults allowing doses sold UK? JFC. Ok bud. sure troll crazy.  😂 facts healthy, young person America, probably May-June. varies wildly even state. outside America, every country different timeline. know fairly topic christianity America sheer insanity. can't even explain it. American, probably seems normal you, guys christianity lmfao. 


At least, yknow, things see American media relating christianity. it, batshit insanity. Honestly 13% very...appropriate? 15% country lives DC Boston. that's including places snowed in, like Buffalo Pittsburgh Chicago Detroit. shutdown border Americans, rather allowing people enter fresh PCR test enter quarantine subsequent test. lets return favor COVID stats favor. don’t think comment meant discredit. recognize it’s necessarily repeatable everywhere. boxes don’t mean automatically succeed either. distribution potential.  one summer? quarantine people travel outside tri-state area isolate anyone tests positive contacts. July? Literally one though sad. know history I've heard lot suspicion medicine general based medical experiments done affecting african americans 1950s. born despised ethnic minority middle east lot strange scalp radiation treatments directed ethnic group brothers sisters suferred from. led lot resentment backlash suspicion authority.

But there's another thing watch happens years later... I'm sure say english: ""Affinity Fraudsters"". ""affinity fraudsters"" basically con-artists traffic anger resentment members group. make money financial scandals corrupt acts hide mutual trust exploiting mutual anger resentment authorities. side effect conmen left older brothers sisters bunch stupid conspiracy theory stories passed onto kids medicine. reason nobody blames conmen. wonder thing happened work hospitals refusing vaccines. i’ve headache every single day since last year. doctor told take advil doesn’t anything anymore :/  power mate. What's done, done. Enjoy life without feeling guilty, matter anyone tries tell you.  sure worse possible. 

That's easy. people keep behaving like holidays similar, getting together groups, wearing masks, etc, could end another spike cases. people get close together wear masks, virus spread.

However, least one new variants significantly infectious original dominant variant. spike infections would happen would much larger terms total infected ones we've had.  Twice many infected per day (two three weeks later) corresponding number deaths spiking possible.

The open question fast variants become dominant whether people US start things avoid spreading it. Time tell.

As far ""natural immunity"", despite gut might tell enough people immunity either vaccine recovering virus get us much discussed ""herd immunity"" especially new variants reinfect number people already old feels little like scaremongering continue act like something worse went doorstep. people need hear message still hear it, listening already minimize exposure.

There's reason trying convey information.  Look many people thread assuming drop cases deaths vaccine administered pandemic ""winding down"", truth we're spike caused holiday season gatherings end 2020. enough productive capacity apparently People depressed prone clinging worst case scenarios. 


But vast majority world vaccinated time yet. answer bailouts? terrible answer lead debt inflation two bad things What's hold Canada? Keep mind many Pfizer vaccine doses made eu shipped UK. Would like see exports blocked? better point skip second dose everyone received first dose? better 100% people (or close possible) vaccinated 76% efficacy 50% people vaccinated 82% efficacy. people need tarred feathered. cannot reasoned with. point out, accidental laboratory exposure “fake” nonsense. CDC happen. I’m conspiracy theorist, I’m trying highlight reality we’re 13 months road still don’t intermediate host “it probably bat” it’s people. SARS MERS zoonotic, traced back human intermediate host population inside 9 months average Joe? Congrats Russian scientists. Good job. Well ya I’m aware news media adore negative doomsday headlines cause that’s gets clicks people watch cable news. People don’t care feel good news unless it’s world altering 

That said goods news that’s coming always qualifiable. vaccines effective, *as* effective. virus mutated right it’s *massive* problem, *could be*. 

So ya definitely agree goods news outweighs bad news. news media spending every minute every hour every day pumping info people get vaccines, don’t cause doesn’t sell. *all* news good think it’s small amount comparison think. Sputnik V rescue! Yes. send best agent, Jason Arrest. 100% here. live alone, work remotely 100% time (and since 2017), boyfriend broke 2 weeks ago, feels like I've lost connection friends used really good social life this. feels like it'll never end. :( Also important think '55% effective' really means. likely closer 100% effective preventing deaths. people finally realizing negative fallout school closures students families. Even UN warned school closures risk resulting lost generation students.  Jesus Christ, past year tough, ""I'd rather coma 11 months suffer lifelong consequences it"" tough. Well body actually caught produced antibodies. Fuck man. Personally don’t think it’s bad. lost job got another, stress, spending lot time home nice. 
But say fuck shit not, that’s still year life. could pretty fucked this. feel complete opposite. initial shock Covid like month lockdown, understood road ahead us knew things going change quickly. March April felt like eternity ever since time flown really mad seems like lost year life.  .... Maybe go back sleep kid.  That’s misunderstanding virus vaccine work blame media poor science journalism giving impression.

Vaccines magical shields keep getting virus virions inside body. Technically, point get amounts virus you’re vaccinated inside you. technically **no** vaccines actually prevent “getting” virus.

What prevent viruses replicating inside you, causing sick, reduce eliminate viral shedding (spreading virus, essentially).

Now again, news bad reporting correctly - you’ll see statements like, “the vaccine doesn’t prevent spreading virus”, that’s misunderstanding science scientists talk.

What really happened vaccine companies didn’t test scientifically, do, they’re going make claims reduce infectivity. didn’t say doesn’t, said “we don’t know yet, act like does”

But biology suggests almost certainly - infectivity COVID almost certainly related amount viral shedding going on. fact, entire nations staked vaccination plan idea, like UK Israel, prioritized single vaccinations people rather double fewer - idea vaccine prevent spread. It’s also one main ideas healthcare workers prioritized (the they’re exposed likelier get sick).

That doesn’t mean shouldn’t still **act** like you’re infectious you’re vaccinated, don’t know much vaccine prevents infection, almost certainly prevent substantial percentage minimum. Estimates I’ve seen north 65% reduction. One good point abstract:

**Implications available evidence**

Our results provide important insights knowledge regarding risk SARS-CoV-2 transmission COVID-19 development. fact transmission risk primarily driven viral load index cases, factors symptoms age, suggests cases considered potential transmitters irrespective presentation encourages assessment viral load patients larger number close contacts. Similarly, results regarding risk expected time developing symptomatic COVID-19 encourage risk stratification newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections basis initial viral load. Copenhagen Stockholm similar densities really see issue but, completely rediculouse compare densities whole countries 80%+ empty??? Bro come calling people out, statistic course. Anyone done would know statistics posted easily shown context (such data got collected, accuracy data data get collected still used analysising data, urbanisation etc). pretty sure Komvux want take it. Would help greatly definitely looking today's currently climate much data need process.  met new starters work March went shake hand. recoiled made joke touching elbows instead, inside screaming CAN'T SERIOUS!

I think thought bit weird, maybe less hindsight. Lucky kid didn’t yolo GME either buildings places physical distance can't maintained. Children believe pregnant women also still clear take vaccine. Even get every non-pregnant adult vaccinated, there’s still good chunk population left. I’ll pay Executive Membership get priority Kirkland vaccine. /s  caught spinal meningitis hospital child, happens hospitals:/  mean, genuine question. Spanish flu took 1 year, yes, arms race! That's probably assuming distrib prod numbers increase will

Over July *in US* realistic, june def possibility That's use many CVS Walgreens. Gotchya, thanks clarification !    well hope aren’t paralyzed Definitely. Lmfao... Maybe Russia history poisoning people nations' soil wanted people buy ""vaccine"". still vaccinating Russian vaccine.

What's matter, doc? one negative test hospital would guess pneumonia different cause. viral bacterial pneumonia. bacterial type wide spread normally. caught easily tge cold months wearing dirty face mask. please everyone, change wash face mask often possible. alone street people around opt breathing clean fresh air. still good practice confirming stops transmission. even symptoms, someone transmit talking someone else. asymptomatic transmission actually huge problem. study confirms news people hoping for. receive 2nd dose Thursday even continue wear two masks socially distance confirmed vaccine got prevents transmission. Well, gotta thank UK Israel taking vaccines produced EU.  Copy paste done another journal! wonder sage knowledge tell us stupid is.  think are. immune system immediately attack virus, chance significantly reproduce spread others. possible journals repeating thing thousand times. peer-review process sham. Sure, ""best"" process checking work *currently* still sham. read way much message, disputing point never made.

I fully expect pharmacy call 911 serious allergic reaction, whether epi pen used not. spending far much time something extremely rare. Moderna it’s 1 person 4 million doses. Pharmacies dealing vaccines potential allergic reactions decades now. Let’s assume new kids block. They’ve vaccinating elderly nursing homes assisted living covid months now. They’ve dealt vaccines decades. sure people trying make incompetent now. 

Have good day. Except claims came September/October... virus tested. *Now*, 90% effective. guy lost credibility. he’s saying may true (or not) needs come someone else. He’s already admitted he’ll say he’s supposed say. Regardless truth. A? bought hundreds facemasks! really doubt good true 6 months

12 Unless deaths skyrocket something like that, doubt even matters.

For I'm concerned, Sweden done pretty good 👍 I'm really sure honours, Americans know much anyway, besides Sir, Lord, Duke, Dame. seemed indicate infected heart CNS?! talking about? Yeah retrospect I'll pass variant ta :D Yes, lockdowns work! wrong thinking expected vaccine cuts transmission (rather simply suppressing symptoms)? J&amp;J promised 100M June Amazing man, survived jungles Burma Second World War. never met him, greatly miss him.  another country trying desperately get vaccines. Things need open April. Science clearly shown covid issue people almost vaccinated point (the ones want it.) cant live year this. 


I don’t care work home person politician making 300k+ says. us give careers industries worked decades work 50+ hours minimum wage reopening.

Ya know vaccines use immune system lol. really sure responding Damn yeah Atlanta time, left hell legacy behind might treat way regards flu shots. Please read write. Please. shocked saw guys still approved vaccine. also surprised see there’s much vaccine hesitancy Japan. What’s that? pathetic really. way late, bite magical thinking believe variants really began three places world genomic sequencing vaccine testing.  Coronavirus seasonal like flu! think lot time people accidents understand everything, bodies let down. That's whole prisoner body thing. Well basically lie public, Botha fauci trump admin, sake “they can’t handle truth.” public respond kind.

I hate blame people listening organizations tell us something lie us boyfriend's step-mom father caught covid upstate SC hospital believe maskless nurses. they're fine infuriating. Welcome back, pal Vaccines use immune system nothing themselves, work way. lucky manufacture vaccines 90% efficiency. Covid different harder vaccinate (let's say 50% max) would still getting vaccines.

Vaccines need perfect, need decrease R value. lockdowns too! one point among safest states. means would fallen coma March, covid reported news... real question is, many waves many years? Sadly yes, use make happy back March April, really cry upon hearing news earlier today.
(I'm States well, live New York.) definitely long-term effects, usually extremely rare get found trials.

There big scandal swine flu vaccine causing insomnia rare cases Nordic countries. vaccines however tested current covid vaccines are.

My point is, legitimate question even everything points approved vaccines safe use. Friendly Reminder people worried variants: vaccines prevent hospitalizations like trials (including variants), job. end needing annual covid vaccine new mutations might lots us do, rona season year trial data published? can't find anywhere. grandma 2. says remembers mother sewing mustard plasters, remembers talked years. need ask it. vaccinated too. nasal swabs 70% accurate best summer, may better now, idk, probably rona Agreed! Potentially it’s enough end hospitalisation death - pandemic end, whether get second dose not. 

Once you’re limited cold - 76% better flu vaccine. 

I wouldn’t terribly surprised 50s end single shot data large scale comes in. 

Most administration delay UK whether like not, they’re running population level study. though. likely enough people vaccinated, happened yet. 13 months sick six weeks diagnosis. Brain fog!! Fatigue, can't sleep, shortness breath, arthritis much worse. New wierd thing second joint locking one finger. That's fun.

Coworker impaired variously everything sick. Went hard Nov. Lost family members. I've lost count ER trips. 3 steroids 95 Ox. ER trip yesterday pinpoint shots cranium headaches. news may virus time, economic, social, educational impact really bad. Really bad. district’s board meeting full parent comments basically summed “my boss says can’t keep much longer...” reference adjusted schedules. know knee jerk response “yeah, covid!” life complicated that. haven’t eaten two days I’m waiting covid complication death.

Wait, what? sought medical attention? NI averaging 10K vaccinations day 260,000 doses already administered. Excluding children can't receive vaccine, NI adult population vaccinated around mid-June time. Assuming continue current rate. wish sputnik v available North America, would take heartbeat. Fuck politics, health number one priority. hope ways dealing it, better.

Edit: Full speed ahead little aggressive. 104 million vaccine doses 7.5 billion people start. can’t fathom waking to... this. utter failure government, imminent collapse democracy, half country parading around saying it’s nothing. I’d like “put back sleep” Sputnik Lite: Less drilling, paced great! :)  course Jersey bad. Old Jersey. tried new instead? YAAAAAANG!!! like...literally cusp time...but time yet. want send kids back school April/May, maybe ok get large portion adult population. really, it'd going back school May/June...2 months. eh. 

Trying get kids back 2 3 months earlier spread virus even Listen man

Like train end pandemic rolling ahead full speed can't stop  black, would different story. Agree. order get vaccine, teachers sign contract return work.  people actively killing others they’re half baked beliefs. Stop handling kid gloves throw book them. people type childish here.

Lmao. irony Even limited testing US shown new variant beast dominant. likely new variants US, can't around long, can't much better spreading.

The new variant UK vast majority cases. would thought April 1 would primetime. Enough time vaccinate 65 older, teachers, case levels dropping, flu season ending, weather get better.  …Immediately hits self head hammer. Yeah, pilot episode Walking Dead! lol, yes meant. fact linked median salary field he's even says lot. First all, someone who's among best world field anywhere close median salary, that's useless. Second, he's epidemiologist. article presents little way facts, yet CNN loud bullhorn impacts public opinion policy. deserve called scaremongering. Agreed lol think possible assume anyone without vaccine may susceptible sa variant, vaccine rate efficacy extremely important determining value R, we're past 8th month mark places like NY. history type thing surges reach certain vaccine thresholds, we're near without considering children can't vaccinated studies complete summer.

Late summer likely timeline vaccination kicking levels needed remove threat. people get lax thinking then, we'll another surge. Counterpoint, concerts really long time. Good question! Probably latter. We're even 2% population fully vaccinated yet, 2% many old people make bulk hospitalizations health-care essential workers spread virus more, hence cases falling hospitalizations. virus bit serious though. Wearing two hearing aids doesn’t seem like good idea.  Learned something new thanks you. work vendor Russia whenever process invoices I’d notice street name address Pobeda think sounded like name Peabody...Now know it’s real word name. Lowest new case # Tuesday since Nov. 3 actually good article.

It good job explaining mutations they’re problematic, article acts vaccine efficacy somewhat mystery concerning 484 variants.

It’s not.

We two vaccines, J&amp;J Novavax specifically tested environment variant dominant majority cases variant found 57% 60% efficacy respectively 100% efficacy preventing deaths hospitalizations 

Also, Moderna Pfizer tested vaccines it’s two dose regiment SA variant found antibody levels well needed neutralize variant, although drop 

Not bad article, complete think wrong it'll play (because fucked vaccine prioritization) look ages people vaccinated. sub 50 70+. Yup. Lack consequences invitation keep trying till succeed. After, Minister Jens Spahn has admitted Germany purchased extra doses Covid-19 vaccination in separate agreement **after** agreeing buy 60 million doses vaccine EU-wide deal.

Only **apparent** violation, President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Friday member states agreed “there **parallel** negotiations **parallel** contracts”. would bet widespread. global level shitty behavior. White right wing though. means get second try. Ok. California also terrible spike dining Florida says Hi. 10k days last weeks would like word you. Guess shoulda waited distribute anything manufactured enough vaccinate US once

/s question - find Cluster 5? (the kind jumped back already mink humans) ?  bailing auto industry lead debt inflation? bailing airlines? ITT: fresh batch anecdotal comparisons contradict scientific studies indicting indoor activities. I’m sorry feel like lied to, it’s completely appropriate public health response handful isolated cases virus different response widespread community transmission. 

Think back January February last year. honestly think people would reacted Fauci come told everyone need start wearing masks everywhere? Someone using common sense. states get people vaccinated , world somewhat get back business usual. bottom line- governors losing funding ( money !) True that. sickness failed penetration test flu defense. sign social end know is. watched Sputnik horror movie. Damn it. Waiting see EU rather see people die ask Russia vaccines. That’s political lines drawn, plus billions dollars stake pharmaceutical companies. vaccine could 100% effective still wouldn’t imported U.S aligned nations. I’m CA I’ve lockdown like year Visit state that's mostly open (like FL) decide yourself. That's country headed (yes, even CA). Netherlands Would like see that? Realistically I'd love see world sing Kumbaya everyone share resources thats reality world.

Clearly movement UK vaccine EU way around. Otherwise EU asking vaccines first place. Mondays Tuesdays tend lowest hospitalization drop. 650 one smallest we've seen awhile. 


I keep waiting hospitalizations drop faster cases due vaccinating high-risk, yet. means either we're wrong that's going play out, vaccines making felt yet. shit. Next they're gonna tell us we've less exercise! put weight (gasp!) Thanks. didn't. Hugs. Atlantic isn’t scientific study!!! Sure is! 🙄 Nobody going cry alcoholics junkies. actually good news UK traumatic brain injury via bullet less.  Yea see morons n95s cold still see breath escaping. can't prevent MASK Sputnik V similar combination Astra-Zeneca Johnson Johnson vaccines. used 2 separate vectors improve booster dose response (vector immunity decrease spike-specific immune response). would great get AZ/JNJ co-sponsored trial one acting 1st acting 2nd dose. Pretty cool natural immunity works! dad diagnosed T1 diabetes 70s, 3 months mugged. Back then, better understanding caused it, attributed trauma mugging.

All years later, makes me.wonder actually really cause. I’m sorry aren’t finding pandemic cheery you’d like be. Vaccines fight too. Get yourselves, pandemic over. Yes. Decentralized distribution. part plan along. correct. mistakenly thought Spanish flu started 1914. 1918. Maybe could turn different kind sub. idea though. Plot twist: steal ID, put gray wig, get vaccine instead her! 

(just kidding. this)  also remember Neopets ties Scientology. I’m really sorry :(. thought, believe doctors headache specialists (that actual specialty/title) - able to, maybe could try arrange consult one? can’t speak long-haul COVID, headache disorders migraine, classes medication aside NSAIDS available treat even prevent headaches. may worth looking talking doctor like able to? case, hope able find answer soon!!   grown adult there's little do. assume tried. that’s timeline, probably cancel order put new one inevitable updated vaccine negotiate deal you’re first line. Hopefully vaccination programs developed countries coming close excess sent developing countries.

Of course ideally would spread equitably based population start know going happen. Sadly, way late this. unimaginable international travel still permitted much is. It’s crazy you’re vulnerable want survive. They've testing Czech cross border workers like crazy months. report Czech authorities. anything numbers way higher. Ah lovely. nice cup of... wait glowing brighter sun? work like that... mean, offense, bad president, change much us good show news every single day. Earth kept going, political class kept sitting couch matter vaccine production autonomy. AstraZeneca articles confusing. Seems like marketing team trying play sales strategies. fair, rare beginning, variants Brazil SA may able evade natural immunity higher rate variant came Europe spring. think depends live, clearly, US actually better mask wearing commonly thought. [This article little shows mask wearing US actually pretty high compared countries. I’ve seen recent data (but can’t find it) mask wearing 75%. 

Heck, even something politicized Biden’s “mask challenge” [supported 75% population. Almost 60% would support Biden instituting lockdowns business closures (even though can’t that). 

The media narratives (including social media trends) data America’s attitudes towards pandemic tell wildly different stories. vast majority us sick tired damn thing want end it. Fuck that. Rabies everyone! party thanks condescending. entire livelihood, seeing family close friends seen 6 months. cannot take longer already disease less 0.2% chance killing me, especially vaccinated people like. 'many peoole' - bollocks mate.  giving guys first vaccines? least kind priority? Grocers stores like seem pretty high risk. bad news. wrong side things getting better. course vaccinated people wont spread it. wont get sick. already antibodies. nice studies prove also foregone conclusion. going include trying foster trust people continue mistreated medical professionals.

So 49 Million people vaccinated isnt enough build trust? I'm sorry bullshit. True, lot people saying back then. I'm acknowledging I'll biased comment removed due low quality. contribute high quality information, [please see sub rules Comments low effort, trolling, conspiracies, brigading removed.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  claiming Germany suffered badly last couple months? Tranquilizer guns anyone? data literally say anything except there's lockdown going on. Cases hospitalizations going several European countries. Welcome new world mf! really. They’re using pretty much version spike protein. They’re delivering different ways. Lockdowns vaccines probably eradicate would make covid less threat overcrowding hospitals causing deaths. Well that's terrifying. pretty annoying tried ridicule answering question, completely ignore respond.

Pretty typical male behavior. already high pandemic. Yes, governments world banded together personally create new variants hate high GDP get sexual pleasure making people wear face masks. teach bearing it, Ontario government fumbled school reopening royally across province. 

Then put blame squarely people following safety protocols, pretending schools never part problem. easy enough kids remained asymptomatic. *“Wow shut Europe? Flight bans? international travel decimated? lockdowns? Jesus virus must awful! Stimulus cheques? Business shut downs? Oh god that’s tragic awful plague must worst... wait hear right 99.6% survival rate? Oh... sure?”* lot vaccines don’t stop spread. immunologist, common sense intramuscular injection poor job inducing immunity nasal oral mucosa, course would expect vaccines aren’t going fully able stop spread. Ah, ""maybe"" - core scientific method. return normal, whether virus here, isn't. sentence alone turns brains mush. Physician here: short answer - don’t know yet vaccines reduce transmission. Pfizer moderna use primary end point studies obtain emergency use authorization. looked people got symptoms covid infection drastically reduce symptoms. studies ongoing years data coming future right people stated hard data transmission vaccination there. claimed mRNA vaccines updated 6 weeks. easy update vector DNA vaccines? Feels like lot news like yesterday, maybe day before. local. Kroger (dillons) going start giving vaccines, Walmart, etc. Fauci said vaccine distribution improve. Direct shipment pharmacies. Pfizer gave new nice estimate.

I'm starting get hopeful. really hope talk new administration actually making difference. South Africa 3 months ago. Never let guard down. demand management, targeting Pfizer Moderna. vaccines distributed now. impact lowering demand currently available vaccine. exemption list appears specifically countries share unrestricted borders EU, makes sense considering might well part EU. article points 100% effective severe cases vaccinated participants died even hospitalized.

Which, let’s honest here, battle. don’t want get coronavirus all, *really* don’t want hospitalized it. Skip Paywall: Covaxin better safer allowed children Wow gonna watch 8 episodes AOT s4 once. Lucky fella. Almost plot 28 days later possible there's Indian variant really weaker others? wonder sloppy protocols patient coma. question lays new mutations... herd immunity ""work""? Tbh , definitely loose there. However given hospitals medical centers completly screwed rollout, I'm surprised turned private sector due better efficiency. However making exclusive idiotic move. purchased degree wait one month two party. vaccines prevent anyone getting sick many people 20's still get severe symptoms die. That’s France earlier (heavier) spike reacted earlier it. simply delay. Also, France really well. Apart can’t actually judge quality responses data excess mortality analyzed later on. report won’t mid-21. company breaking contract. fault EU? Ok. don’t wanna discuss. That’s fine wonder............hmmmm Dr. Fauci right money almost every time. Love him. populated one.

It’s also pandemic. Reading hard I’d also try avoiding nightshades. long term minor symptoms, started keep food diary. quickly realized nightshades reason causing post COVID flare ups. Might give try. 
Have r/covid19positive yet? You’ll find lot help support there. body, choice  idea pushed pre-clinical studies primates showed vaccine candidates suppress SARS-COV-2 replication lungs, oral nasal mucosa. 

But go ahead keep believing everyone who’s telling bad news lying you. I’m sure that’s working great last year. I’d say thing you. I’m wearing mask hike regardless doest matter much me, sharing opinion. sub tends echo chamber Actual footage Americans speaking vaccine Thanks article No. isn't. nothing nationalism. cooperate democratic countries. China trade partner. India should. Russia China can't trusted. seriously overly dramatic idea putting mask on. Corporate hate, mom pop shops versus big pharmacies might mean something pricing comes giving vaccines, best, giving edge large players efficiency. shit. area?  number may true month ago people hesitant guinea pigs think seeing tons others get vaccine fine see much higher acceptance. non-paywalled version please? school. wait long? hard understand don’t need sterile immunity reduce spread, that’s whole point. *any* increase immunity going reduce spread, reducing amount time you’re contagious. Something increases immunity enough keep even old infirm getting sick? Gonna drastic impact long virus survive body.

So yeah might make person sick. won’t make everyone sick, statistically.

This kills pandemic. Good point, go work everyday crowded classroom feel invulnerable, lame excuse like “needing money survive”. Imagine...the people working spreading virus. almost like, dunno, offer vaccine! Good! Let private sector best: eliminate red tape improve efficiency! There's another Chinese vaccine came 78% efficiency though act like USA swimming vaccine doses right now. haven’t even come close vaccinating extremely vulnerable groups. news stories hundreds millions doses expect months now. actually get them, USA position exporting excess vaccine doses...because excess vaccine doses. 

Also, way shift blame this. year Canadian’s (correctly) mocking USA’s atrocious pandemic responses superiority Canadian’s, want act like Canada helpless big bad America isn’t sharing vaccine doses don’t have? happened Canada’s superior pandemic planning? Making vaccine exclusive Publix brilliant, lol Probably lot purchase allotments, since AZ likely choice CoVax sent impoverished countries US focused initial orders, recent reup, J&amp;J, Moderna Pfizer. sure cannot issue EUA anyway, I'm sure time-to-benefit valuation going on. Unless independently tested, I'm trusting it.

When Russia doping testing Olympics, secret doors could manipulate results Russian athletes.

I believe doctors pharmacologists Russia general good people. problem government infiltrate one crook manipulate it.

Where there's Kremlin influence, super cautious probably testing ourselves. She’s assistant physician got medical degree Caribbean Medical University Curacao May 2014.

Kinda tough claim know nothing bogus “medical treatment” you’re shilling went school field. People New Zealand aren’t happy i've heard tested +65 year old folks. anyone know find paper studies? stance tell people nervous second dose. day discomfort worth price, prep it. Ironically, sister got day zero issues. It’s capable spreading room nobody circumstances right. Covid spreading walking someone briefly low chance, sure it’s zero never zero chance. Seems like extreme overkill you. wear 2 masks hike now? Never safe enough! Lol really don’t understand y’all missed much! time...nothing really all... Jeez. put together middle schooler. line people stick. “Phase 1B-Tier 3: people two underlying....” Jesus Christ give break. lose sorts efficiency operations flow break things finitely.  ct scans? thats major blood clots problems, ferritine dimer test? easy simply, people since March. Trail ettique thing, hikers quick adapt. 

Also, normally spread, still capable unlucky. Masks reduce chance even further. There's magic barrier covid goes ""no, wait! person 7 feet away; can't spread there!""

This time year, people faces covered hikes cause cold anyway here. one Florida. pandemic. limited supply vaccines. like vaccinated elderly 1 vaccine young people another. causes delay deaths. sensible health regulator make sure effective vaccines given people needing restricting access people risk. certainly better experts field, think much time he's spending interviews etc. even actual experts particular virus (Fauci one them) wrong throughout pandemic. need hear many voices. expected significantly reduce transmission making illness mild reducing time illness. expect eliminate transmission due fact IM vaccines don’t tend confer strong mucosal immunity would expected period time virus multiplying mucosal surfaces mucosal immune systems attack little bit help systemic immune systems. would seem expectations correct. Unfortunately, doubt could even wanted to. FDA pretty good reputation comes scrutinising vaccines, get reputation going, ""Well good enough Europeans..."" Pfizer Moderna take two doses, interval 3-4 weeks, reach 90+ percentile. compare single dose, aren’t nearly effective AZ vaccine. 

I think strategy quickly get everyone single dose AZ, greatly reducing transmission, follow 2nd dose afterwards. ICU work in, policy test patients weekly. consistently issues patients would first test negative visitors could still infect patients Really truly type propaganda prolong pandemic That's refuse shut work places pay people stay home 2 months. people FORCED choose catching virus letting family starve. gov't continues fail us. everything vaccine nationalism, democratic countries hoarding production still buy outside, countries producing others.

Currently countries actively producing vaccines others EU, India, China Russia. USA UK locked national production still getting stock Europe.

Russia China can't trusted, yet part stop global pandemic. UK USA basically solving problem, EU start looking somewhere else, India much. Ditch them. There's repairing relationship people personally attack way. debating merits, attacking person. friends.   city lockdown, restaurants open. are, lockdown thus action fine. Unless asking missing Husband time media move on. use FFP2 masks things bad, reusable masks rotate every day things aren’t bad, recently go university daily (they switched online February though). That, multiplied family members, plus broken masks, that’s inadvertently get hundreds masks (as 100-200). think enough stock end year. Georgia took gamble. still irresponsible global pandemic. forget people carry virus Georgia necessarily end sick Georgia.

Georgia's decision definitely impacted situation beyond borders. doctors nurses *pleading* people stay home, thinks like playing online statistician expert, necessarily drawing criticism. 

But find weird friends actually alienated much. friend US, who's living Seattle who's outright Covid denier. thinks *""the coof scam!""* apart calling fucking moron, really much relationship. sense think post right, saying come back something neutral that's Covid related.

Unless friends capable differentiating, see they'd ignore friend simply stand lockdown. Example: proof fridge isn’t full snakes  Thanks, ofcourse get vaccine. fuck mental health even staying isolated whilst rest population not. mean, know least 1 example vaccine suppresses symptoms allowing transmission, pertussis acellular vaccine. Bordatella still colonize nasal cavity vaccinated individuals, cause disease due type immunity generated vaccine (I believe memory B cells generated acellular vaccine?). whole cell pertussis vaccine prevented transmission disease, completely safe administer, moved away it. big difference Bordatella virus commensal bacteria live commonly body mucosal surfaces without needed cause infection, replicate, viruses need Infect host cells. seems like immunity granted vaccines target viruses prevent transmission essentiality infection viral proliferation, actually looked vaccines yet. seem intuitive vaccine help cut transmission. No, immunologists use qualifiers like “May” “possibly”. difference lay people interpret 50/50 chance. scientists still use wording something .01% chance happening. Personally think it’s pseudo temporary herd immunity. 30% population thinks 30% reckless people nuts stay distance extra vigilant. things heat % 70% gets infected rises.  people middle get shook move cautious side makes % infected even weighty.  boom drop.  

But it’s real herd immunity.  It’s like unkept campfire burns low.  still ends sticks logs stretched across never got burned right there. push center, fire blaze little time all. Neighboring Wisconsin Indiana also better Illinois, despite restrictions. fact, Illinois worse neighbors despite restrictions. really. don’t consider question absolutes. good bad relative classifiers position doesn’t consider bad plenty indicators showing others worse. Also, ignored point time don’t really know different actions fared time crisis. Thus, assessment simply remains invalid. Oh yeah next gen consoles came there’s deadly pandemic going killed millions atleast games Imagine going coma mid 2016 waking today:

""So hear Biden's president? Weird, thought Hillary running going president, Biden running second term? everyone wearing masks hospital busy..."" anyone point list things new coronavirus relief bill? I've tried many terms google keep getting old irrelevant results. set settings search within one week, still get political headlines Manchin showdown republicans trying lower stimulus. tried looking text bill. Nothing. posted nostupidquestions, removed ""about"" coronavirus (which not). 

Can please get fairly comprehensive list what's bill? Also, bonus question, fuck hard find? spread misinformation. **recount** vials make sure throwing away 500  Yepppp. allowed wear masks Walmart till mid March. Wanted mask start February. obrigado pela informação, u/arroz_com_feijao  really hope civil. Yes, that’s 10%, count population whole. 74 million population 18, percentage vaccinatable (pretty sure that’s word...if be) 13%. understand fine 76% isn’t total confidence booster get hate, July everyone else got vaccine, go back normal?

I mean still get vaccine, point it'll civic duty like voting.  OK, 330 million live US. 250 million eligible get vaccine due age constraints. 70% 175 million people. 21 weeks July 4th. need vaccinate 8.3 million people week July 4th get threshold. Pfizer Moderna need twice number doses, 16.6 million doses week them. Pfizer produced 4.4 million last week Moderna produced 5.8 million, 10.2 million. need produce 6.4 million additional doses week order us reach July 4th mark. continue produce 10 million week, we're looking October.  wife got Moderna, first dose gave 2-hour fever gave mouth weird metallic taste day. Second dose gave 8-hour light fever went away nap. Otherwise perfectly fine. Might put bit damper camping trip ruin entire time. shared meme January made fun western medias sensationalization 10 deaths random virus China vs hundreds thousands die heart disease. Oops......  Whoa easy liberal talking points get nuked sub much treason come one country? problem currently enough supply line people inject them. 

I agree - tiered approach much inefficient mass vaccination program. can’t that. So, focus needs vaccinating likely exposed infected moving supply increases.  spread misinformation. Israeli adult, ones occupied territories. UK speed USA also skipping second dose? USA given 9.73 doses per million people, UK done 14.94. UK around 50% ahead regardless whether first doses mix first second. difference UK given protection far greater number people USA focused greater protection smaller number. mAsKs bAd change mind California catches up? Currently 70% deaths per day (per capita) Florida, gap closing rapidly.  common knowledge since vaccine came out. made statement don’t want hear doesn’t make wrong. 

Countless articles come clearly state 25% USA flat refuse get vaccine circumstance another 20-25% extremely hesitant. 

This sub 2 million people it? realize sub doesn’t even resemble 1% United States population. ungodly ignorant assume 331 million Americans mindset want vaccine. recent election show anything divided USA is? It’s actually insane would believe it’s even remotely possible 80% USA willingly vaccinated. Half country won’t even wear mask yet alone acknowledge Covid issue. Maybe language thing. 'There proof of' sounds like refute isn't. happens everwhere. suppose takes context glean meaning from, proof unicorns all.   run covid tests throughout hospital every Monday, matter patient are. also run test new symptom pops related covid. need test (whether he’s coma showing new signs disease) order see nosocomial (hospital acquired) covid cases, would mean visitors/staff bringing measures prevent need taken. Keep information high quality. huge news.  vaccines show similar results world may able defeat terrible disease  Yeah kill random civilians give whole NATO justification invade cut Putin’s head off. Really smart idea got there. Grow up. world isn’t black white natural herd immunity worked. flu virus would become extinct decades ago. Becoming upset reality change it.  got “you’re selfish” lecture sister told I’d go eat restaurant right now. Social media, especially woke Twitter crowd, ruins people.

She's ""ruined"", right. city lockdown citizens asked stay home, ignoring eat out, others sacrificing things, themselves, consideration others well, bit selfish. 

It really matter personally think right wrong, there's general ruling out. case stomach that. started vaccines IMO. Essential workers top. offense elderly it'd contain spread faster. get populous vaccinated polio took massive federal government involvement every level.

Until hear every library school every county whole country getting setup vaccinations going right direction probably. 

If 'x private entity x' getting less more. get there.  Go back bed, dude, shit ain't worth it.  Ah, stepping back original denial. wise. obligated international law occupying force. See comment comprehensive explanation. Anyone believes probably shouldn’t reproduce anyway. company talked bringing us back office July. rate vaccine rolling seems unlikely. guys going cut BS Israel must vaccinate Palestinians?

**Commentary 1958**

Convention (IV) relative Protection Civilian Persons Time War. Geneva, 12 August 1949.

ARTICLE possible certain cases **national  authorities perfectly well able look health  population; cases Occupying Power  intervene**; **it merely avoid hampering work organizations responsible one denied reinfections possible happening. people willing wait see serious problem fist. 

It got wondering common reinfections diseases. doesn’t seem impossible unlucky individuals get reinfected similar stains flu year despite immunity it. don’t breathlessly report case reinfections something like happens. 

This isn’t comment saying covid like flu obviously. It’s issuing distinguishing possible, common, serious issue. far, covid reinfections clearly “possible” stage. It’s still soon know common serious issue yet. mean many states restarted indoor dining? commenter right. I'm talking personal freedom standpoint one public policy. Yes. Redditor anecdotes meaningless sorry Mhmmm, yup, sure, wear mask.... Yup guys did. Right Europe/USA got dibs lot early supply. Also vaccines + guys spend $$$ accelerating many trials possible multiple vaccines like EU/USA did. 

Again, Canada could done lot better. borne real world. reinfections 2%, would 2,000,000 now. 47. ffs hate living province use two letter code Netherlands

I thought post Newfoundland, Canada (distinguished NL, Canada) Since brought issue. I've researched wrote comment covering topic. is: 

I compiled Evidence based answers Israeli-Palestinian vaccine issue case confused. issue around Israelis refusing vaccinate Palestinians Palestinians affirming obligation international law occupying power.

Here the[ Israeli health minister grilled sides seem fight social media, organized efforts even. example,** [**Here Israeli propaganda app directing users repeat certain arguments social media Palestinians refuse take vaccine Israel?**

**No**, didn't. [Here covering Palestinian Authority affirming Israel’s responsibility vaccines. [Here Palestinian Negotiations affairs department citing responsibility Israel occupying power Geneva convention provide vaccine occupied populace. [Here Palestinian ambassador UK occupation choked infrastructure capabilities public health sector Palestine; duty international law provide it, admittedly Zionists care.

\----------------------

**Did Palestinians ask officially?**

**Yes**, [Here truth, Palestinian liaison officials already quietly contacted Israel’s Coordination Government Activities Territories (COGAT) department request vaccine. Israelis agreed help. Assisting Palestinians made sense, since vital maintain degree goodwill coordination two sides West Bank. ""

In response Israel provided dozens vaccines. Looks like attempt humiliation.

\----------------------

**Did Palestinian lose right vaccination Israel Oslo Accords?**

**No,** human rights Geneva conventions lost. stressed UN. International law signed 196 countries, one Israel. can’t waive human rights International law Geneva Convention allow it.

Here human rights experts today called Israel, occupying power, ensure swift equitable access COVID-19 vaccines Palestinian people occupation. \[...\]The experts said occupying power, Israel required Fourth Geneva Convention, “to fullest extent means available it”, maintain health services occupied territory.**Article 56 requires Israel adopt apply “the prophylactic preventive measures necessary combat spread contagious diseases epidemics”** cooperation national local authorities.If protected population inadequately supplied, occupying power required Convention facilitate relief schemes “by means disposal”. **Even relief consignments, including ‘medical supplies’, provided others, Article 60 states consignments “shall way relieve occupying power responsibilities” health care protected population.**“The right health also fundamental human rights issue,” experts said. “International human rights law, applies full occupied Palestinian territory, stipulates everyone enjoys right ‘the highest attainable standard physical mental health’.The denial equal access health care, basis ethnicity race, **is discriminatory unlawful.** ”They said Israeli commentators justified differential treatment grounds 1995 Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement, integral part Oslo Accords, provides Palestinian Authority would assume responsibility health care Palestinian territory, including vaccinations. experts said Oslo Accords must interpreted applied consistent international law, **cannot derogate broad protections. ultimate responsibility health services remains occupying power occupation fully finally ended.** literally data could shown would trust change mind? seems like you’re set opinion nothing change it. Please link study.  Considering fact probably [didn’t reduce spread non-human primates] fact newsworthy. Correct. public messaging rather ""The vaccine prevent transmission.""

It ""we know yet know assume transmit vaccine."" thing happened Poland! 
A guy coma year, wakes whole pandemic situation really thinking people we're fucking xD friends put deeply ugly. I'm sorry experience. relate, limited degree - disgusted social media tone traveling see family last fall. (""If want see family Thanksgiving, get ready Christmas ICU!"")

I easy answer ""road back"" quandary. wife talk lot, often oscillate. Sometimes see ""people right now, we'll come back cooler heads prevail"". times ""a crisis revealed something never realized there"". probably valid, degree.

Personally, say sure good decision deactivating social media accounts. current circumstances, absolutely nothing sensible 90%+ ""friends network"" offer us. live 30 miles north Boston, got foot snow here. friend Connecticut also got foot snow. Inland Massachusetts got similar amounts. Boston Cape Cod get hit much snow, outliers storm. rest us area got clobbered.  study Israel indicate things start going back normal much quicker... particular vaccine. According Bloomberg's tracker number reported vaccinations surpassed confirmed number infections, looking forward this. know actual number infections much higher (5-10x I'd guess, estimate). Can't wait reach next milestone billion! 49% figure worded way makes sound like reduction among entire cohort unvaccinated individuals well. time read article depth work today, guess one dose gives 67% effective immunity individual, two doses gives higher immunity, 2 doses also correlated lower overall spread volunteer cohort would monitor periodically covid positivity. That's sort study would start get transmission info (though would imagine would incredibly hard control outside variables cohort) lower number could make sense context obviously live United States. Single dose both? trump said, “If didn’t testing, would cases.” Also applies varient, healthcare infrastructure overtaxed weren’t looking these. staying shut away years. Period. even need to, vaccine pick up. like vaccinating 20-30% locking vaccine that. ""zero risk"" ideology absurd. yes willing risk health millions fall poverty. got captain fucking debate team here. epidemiology considered here. also socioeconomics politics. Otherwise we'd close school every winter flu. mad - whole narrative ""let's pull together"" fluff.

The US UK - ""the world pull must cooperate... we're first make ourselves, want also make want ASAP.""

The EU - ""we're vaccine nationalism, vaccines everyone, lead example! Take USA, take UK, take Israel... wait, vaccines!?""

While Russia, China India without drama.

It's sad, look state world politics kind expected. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* risk death covid eliminated

I never one, that's definitely goal. Okay, isnt old news?

Didn’t Pfizer Moderna already test vaccines find even E484 mutation vaccines would remain effective, although suffer possible drop efficacy?

EDIT: important mention test done using blood people received FIRST Pfizer dose. know efficacy given second substantially higher circumstances Cool. Well, enjoy constant lockdown, lockdown, lockdown, slightly less lockdown, etc. instead ~month long hard lockdown. Harris car (NYC). Even did, would need take driving lessons again, while. Can't take lessons without exposing instructor. 

Only one person house drives going somewhere hike question. That's I'm asking. person responding kinda ""defending"" saying ""he's always said change ways, ____ happen"". Okay, let's accept that. saying now? I've yet get response...

And person posted within last hour... begs question protesters arrested affectively disrupted prior incident.

A demonstration fine, basic right, disrupting vaccination program not. waiting story like Nuance - из-за connotation negative causal effect. example, “Из-за снега мы опоздали на работу”. Благодаря тому used positive causal relationships. Потому что best neutral causal relationship. Belgium, UK, Italy higher deaths/capita. developed nations? US 10th highest, likely drop vaccination increased. states aren’t shipping directing Feds ship them, least state. I'm worried Super Bowl. survey conducted Super Bowl parties numbers really reflect wide spread event like we'd see holiday season.  went Portland days first weekend March. remember night left first case confirmed Oregon... joking friend I’m gonna die coronavirus trip cause still thought gonna blow weeks.

I know people sub haven’t left homes since last January know I’m one completely underestimated this. Yeah dates line up, one thing brain injury like causes amnesia sometimes extends months longer prior injury. Beggars can't choosers... county? I've noticed NPR air. guest refer someone last name host jumps full name title. Maybe host australia 🦘 state keeps shutting clinics run vaccine. Can't go faster get more, going 4x current rate much issue. No, aren’t? mean specifically Pfizer? Combined we’ll roughly 500 million doses June includes lesser portioned Pfizer so. 😂 don’t know you’re talking about. hope ends Biden's hands. bought paid federal vaccines, maybe. feeling fine print allows manufacturer sell whichever country pays first/the event excess. RNs paramedics aren’t getting vaccine. doctors bc they’re forced hospitals. Rn paramedics educational tier. push meds skills ones. can’t intubate can. thought US ready fast track approval 50% effective vaccine. though state telling send current process. least that’s works MN. Yeah China isn’t model society want live in. Cases start increasing new strain becomes dominant enough. think it’s coincidence countries effected located next Uk? No. takes time go 1 case enough make difference, especially virus spreads asymmetrically (most people don’t spread, spread many) one decision cost many old people Poland lives, like Germany France.

There evidence vaccine efficacy much lower people 65+. extrapolate efficacy younger groups done it. least coronavirus vaccines efficacy comparable.

But no, bureaucrats always try cover ass much possible, case, even unreasonable even people going lose lives it. amateur hour. reason took huge issue pointing even though that's better like like comparison original point making, effect making AZ look bad comparison though. 

I mission making AstraZeneca look bad. merely stated efficacy compared another vaccine. point fair compare J&amp;J AZ one dose compares vaccine's two doses cannot fully understand. Idk speculative data AZ's one dose efficacy something aware early claimed 62% figure incorrect, since pointed come halfway discussion. 

In case, efficacious would terrific news, since LIKE vaccine. love tech love UK's role pandemic. Two things look forward to: 1) Clinical trial data AZ US, 2) Clinical trial data combined Ad26 - ChAd immunization. info expect those, tell me. free one remind things come back US data real world UK trial data 'true' observed efficacy

Don't know Serbia Broski I'm glad see relatively well vaccinations going there, decision use Sputnik good one

It thanks Sinopharm vaccine, Sputnik V. read I'm Serbia lol? Anyways, guess concludes discussion positive(?) way. idea. Seriously. patients truest cannot get vaccinated. 7 0 whatever actual output is, q4 2021 looking brighter week two ago. would convince you?

The result emerged multiple data sets across different countries. I’m convinced it’s 70% it’s deadly, it’s hard argue isn’t transmissible point  vaccine comes benefits accept old people get first travel. ok, sign up? got mine amazon. seal super well thick. I'm glad everyone vaccinated /s doubt. patient bleeding tend get first priority matter stupid action took get there.... 98 year old great grandma nursing home older unhealthier mild cold fine now. Anecdotes mean much. Statistically almost risk. WTF? arrest start? mean, wouldn’t trust Putin inject vaccine fine high 68k cases 7th January fallen 19k today. Cases tumbling earths starting fall still horribly high.  There’s tiktok something orange. think cook taste it? Might worth google search. friend told haven’t watched video. Yes? don’t understand government would realizing makes sense now. It’s year...the need ensure secure domestic source vaccines pretty clear since least April. also far spaced out

This common misconception. Yes, Australia huge 85% population live coastal towns cities half population live three biggest cities. Even look population density cities misleading cities encompass lot greenspace. get Sydney Melbourne CBDs comparable Los Angeles suburb.

I really think explosion cases half-arsed Government responses way people acted weather.  There’s difference EMT doctor. Huge difference education level. Doctors RNs getting vaccine. EMTs LVNs aren’t. What’s good news exactly?

It’s basically mix everyday good bad 

If want fault article it’s emphasizing enough 60% efficacy symptomatic infection good vaccines still 100% effective preventing hospitalizations death. Instead it’s basically foot note  see stupid shit like really makes sick allready. Sure going get better ""very"" quickly literally can't worse. government literally 1 full fucking year put together plan distribute vaccines biggest shit show yet. fucked government! worry larger better! hope change 5G chip least something comes country naturally come back economic reasons sometimes need national interest.

Just think US WW2 bullets made Asia. start producing bullets war effort higher cost instead waiting supply Asia. thing masks fridges before, masks world running fibre make china started laying concrete new factory production started less month later. 

for stuff needed ""last week"" sustainable post covid china put money cut red tape. problem u.s funding stuff expected turn profit time consuming find every step process takes much time, needles needed next year maybe u.s fast enough produce localy needed now, id put money china. Y’all hate comments y’all want it’s real thing. Many healthcare professionals believe same. It’s distrust towards government. Merica! could reality different president. Thank god happen. race Covid vaccines, I'm convinced France time lockdown. 

Yet I'm surprised seem *want* virus spread - pet! can't domesticate it! first aim, else, stop 'green goo' replicating. No, he's saying despite everything vaccines, worst still yet come, make sense me. vaccinating exponentially increasing amounts every week, worst yet come...? actively encouraging people wear masks (including new federal mandates), social distance, wash hands use sanitizers, get vaccinated, statement might make sense. things, literally reason behind decline. I'm educated person I'm sure follow argument... Mexico. free go history Reddit. everyone opposes worldview Russian troll. Here's USA Today article talking much US intervenes foreign elections: LA Times article: paper citing, American professor Carnegie Mellon, mentions US intervened 81 foreign elections Russia 36 1946 year 2000. course expect read change mind. seems like Serbia good place then. Hopefully get vaccinated soon head sarma rakija!   efficacy 62%.

That number lower part test group South African variant, I'm remembering correctly. know Sputnik would compare variant percentages same. Lol, flew New York City Seattle early March scared going place less 10 cases place first deaths happening. I’ve seen multiple patients got Covid hospital. gets passed around. outbreak multiple patients floor got it. everyone diligent room room, I’ve seen techs going rooms masks neck. patients hardly ever wear masks. Narrative? consistent data, found multiple countries saying uk variant 30 50% transmissible strain dominant before. dont buy it? literally seeing two different R numbers two different variants here. else finding different r numbers country?

The us probably doesnt significant prevelance strain. AstraZeneca submitted Emergency Use Authorization FDA approval. Hospital transmission really common. takes one staff member asymptomatic using correct PPE I’m assuming think democrats eat babies too, right?  soon heard Covid expecting outcome. Rest easy, Tom, inspiration right time World needed be. Canadian dream government competent enough vaccinate rate. Russian study says Russian vaccine 91.6% effective. surprise. Looks like counting votes Putin ""elections"".

They nice portfolio medicine.
""Russia banned fielding national team next two Olympics world championship sporting event next two years, decision reduces length Russia's suspension issued World Anti-Doping Agency last year.""

Also published day Navalny Navalny found guilty. coincidence. Chinese colleagues living normal life since March. March!! know, 10 fucking months ago!! went hard lockdown month that's it. keep pushing narrative work. Oh sweet summer child.  read already grumbling, ""aw shit, America."" pleased wrong  We’ve developed two own.  West really hypocritical unfair Russia. Probably dumb question, caught covid month ago still yet regain sense smell taste. Anyone know anything help ? I’ve tried training sense smell progress all. Alcohol tastes like nothing. don’t even need chaser anymore shit :/ N95s aren’t cheap. Even pandemic, non-medical N95s usually went $2.00-3.00 per mask depending manufacturer specifications. intellectually disabled nothing COVID; asthma considered health risk COVID. healthcare worker, vaccinated now. Assuming roommates also 20s, even fat put fatality rate even close 1%. really going destroy mental health that? Nothing life 100% safe, never be. Go outside sake Russians free healthcare nostalgic socialism.  Brits fucking stop denying origin variant. least new variant. firm obtained rights supply AZD1222 vaccine, developed Anglo-Swedish drugmaker Oxford University, mainland China


So affect world supply directly. I'm fine COVID vaccine lower efficacy could still potentially allow mildly symptomatic infection followed months lingering symptoms.

So problems least COVID protection would rather protection all?  Russian vaccine never fails forgot concrete blocks chained legs.  Something might help see low risk 0-14 made something like 0.02% fatalities risk dying literally one million. risk heavily tilted towards elderly health conditions. No-one mentioned variants first year Covid, there's one announced every day.  return normal deaths lockdown (due suicides starvation) higher deaths virus. happen 20% population fully vaccinated. gonna call ""virtually nothing""? think everyone world happen know 2 47 People claims confirmed reinfections??? would governments mandating expensive, private COVID tests, forced business closures, $2k quarantine hotels 3 days suddenly care homeless guy smart phone?

Edit: Countries I'm referring small business lockdowns, UK Canada require **private** PCR tests travel (because somehow hospital can't it), Canada hotel. They're already creating essential health-wealth taxes poor, would problem enforcing something stupid. I'm addressing fallacious argument ""it's fine europe therefore need safety standards bother One bad drug 60 years ago reason 

What shows cannot wholesale rely another government's assessment drug safe. 
All saying acknowledge risk consequences that's decision made. CNA’s high school diplomas GEDs. get 4-12 weeks training.

These aren’t LPNs takes 2 years college RNs takes 4 years. Ah ok got it. makes sense then. Still, would thought would easier find even see itemized list proposed. Thanks links.  There’s football games person season... haven’t heard outbreaks.... it’s doors masks Next time, try size: ""Hey, know numbers mean, look weird me. anyone help make sense this?"" 

Just give shot next time, see happens. True enough. Hopefully Covid somewhere flu measles, terms conserved component. nearer flu trouble, continually escaping virus would continually kill people, herd immunity would even develop - like common cold, deadly. anyone know advantages either traditional vaccine new mRNA ones? live Boston too, nothing here, drive miles got bad. New York City apparently got like 18 inches, NJ like 24. Definitely slowing things down. 40,000 deaths sufficient evidence you? Here, maybe [this help. light end tunnel getting brighter. Also, totally forgotten Astrazenca vaccine US trial results expected later month.  USA locked way. hits way life consumer traffic business *are voluntary.* 

There decision give reopen 30% vaccination covering high risk groups. people want catch harmful airborne disease *know* vaccine available, soon, what's proposal accelerate besides accelerating vaccine?

This market economics, care sick social distancing. E.U. planning getting AstraZeneca vaccines Pfizer ones, would even asking U.K. them? keep Pfizer ones case. ""change mind"". admitted made statement keep people hoarding PPE healthcare workers.

Fauci may smart actions hurt credibility tremendously among people fence mask wearing. coronavirus feeding gremlin midnight? thinking theyr'e occupied make true? also country independent entirely subjective case corrupt governments take care  How? comorbidities? I’m sitting, people taking precautions numbers still dropping like rock. They’ve lying us since beginning try improve compliance seems par course Aside healthcare workers, UK pretty much started oldest people vaccinating way population age. soon, already, obvious case rates older people dropping faster case rates rest population. time tell  knows Covid friends family vary widely virus ""ok"" terms travel interaction. brother pretends everything normal, brother-in-law afraid leave house. friends problem coming hanging indoors. Others literally set foot house.

I try avoid confrontations everyone riled it. time live life way want to.

I agree policy makers apparently completely lost grasp trying strike kind balance. Closing schools year absolutely crazy, shutting countless restaurants small businesses. point lockdowns really even work well. changes needed. one dose reduces PCR positivity 67%, two doses reduces PCR positivity 49% ???

More time get infected maybe? I'm sure time intervals they're comparing they're following 1-dose regimen till time 2nd dose, they're following 2-dose regimen months after, 2-dose data longer period time exposure virus. time being, natural immunity good enough. going away within next half year we'll enough vaccines get Well without vaccines, would choice - hard lockdown till zero (6 months max), continue have, 1 month lockdowns every 4 months - indeed would forever. Fauci degree expertise economic mental health effects year long lockdowns. Except “YET” doesn’t make headlines. way, 560,000 children die every year due poverty conditions. Wanna make difference? Work helping reduce that.  No, it’s safe say that. 

But like everyone else, lot people ignore shit. know evidence is, then, that's claim. Circumstance =/= evidence. ""evidence"" akin saying lost keys simple absence keys means stolen. That's evidence all.

I suggest read thread insight: Massive snow storm northeast make fact, it? Soooo lockdowns masks forever? Sounds fun. fine. Relax. comment vaccination target counting relatively small number natural infections?

COVID new terrible it’s lot different dying war...   Eh, theory drug runner completely plausible well, think said certain case Switzerland wants studies clearing AZ vax. all? course they’ve much longer like covid definitely circulating months even cared. Wow! hardly got accumulation. (I kind looking forward good snowball fight!). dad worked Disney World got furloughed (and fired). late January 2020, first family get sick year. He's also immuno-compromised. got sick February 2020. giving anxiety too! best tell serious complications rare. I’m sorry hear got it, fortunately fine.

Wish speedy recovery friend love Reddit trained read alternating capital letters “ChAdOx1 nCoV-19” ludicrous sarcastic tone. I'm quite surprised 

A) woke 11 months. Though suppose statistically someone too. 

B)They left hospital bed long unconscious. point give up.

C)They let guy occupy hospital bed long time ambulances arent even bother bring people hospital places. say skip vaccine? Seriously, point said that. I'm getting soon possible. said can't lock til every member society gets it. Children able 2022 earliest. Poorer nations likely screwed 2023 sadly. fine mass poverty increasing levels starvation low income countries, sure...advocate ""zero risk"" Normal = indoor concerts, full capacity bars restaurants, large public events, masking requirements, etc...

If judge normal taking precautions everyday life sure lots people returned normal. I’ve similar experiences. got called “monster” said didn’t want dad lose job commercial airline pilot 3 years retirement. People become totally unhinged shit can’t see beyond fear made drones life passes by. personally don’t want people back life Covid revealed true colors me. never trust they’d someone want around crisis that’s definitely indicative aren’t friends. It’s hard lesson learn better late never. answer questions. Wuhan still interesting? Pretty much every major city North America Europe bigger outbreak Wuhan. Hey champ. I'm going give life lesson that's real important, pay attention: 

**If someone attempts remove presence, ever force upon them.** 

Because either ego simply can't handle rejection weak, I'm blocking now. real life, please heed lesson. odds really really low getting sick lasting effects. Kobe Bryant NZ also island, helps lot.  assume even distribution vaccines across population? that’s way fathom number need hit. 

If vaccinate 80-90% 65 older, eliminate major risk thing. really become something individual monitor own. 

I think death rate 65 actually lower flu. Conservatives COVID denier’s always bitched COVID worse flu. problem is, many, really isn’t. But, problem it’s hard truly segregate vulnerable population non-vulnerable...

Until get vaccines. Vaccines thing allows us move individualized approach, open restaurants everything, let everyone decide themselves. vulnerable safe, rest us, decide it’s worth risk wait get vaccinated. would get today could. know US gov would never allow it. I’d fly sure, I’m even allowed... Current UK stats yet prove vaccination reduced numbers. week two could prove that.

Israel's stats showing evidence. vaccinations 1/3 population. literally 0 deliveries UK vaccine (astrazeneca) eu far. first ones astrazeneca going delivered 9th even know produced. about. love highly controlled environment, tho. Again, relative question. global pandemic, course negative consequences. still ignore fact don’t sufficient data judgement. public data conclusive all, neither complete comparable. Raw data analysis conclusion. dont link, given low rates complications/death kids would worried vaccinated parent unvaccinated child. yes i'd look forward kiddo could vaccinated extra behavior changes keep safe (since already safer haha) Fauci smoking crack thinks 85% Americans going take vaccine, ever. lucky see 60%.

So tired increasing percentage every time someone hands microphone. President Tim Burton Biden?  going like iPhone updates. also means last 3-4 weeks jabbed 6% population. rate end year 72%. 

of course rate distribution injection speeding up, taking first dose number subtracting second dose number give us good estimate monthly improvement. PA recognized countries bought vaccines russia parts Israeli control mostly desert area B still Palestinian laws Israeli presence brother police officer took months convincing it’s worse flu. ended getting vaccinated part. close friend CO got covid. said boss leaves officers don’t wear masks One bad drug 60 years ago reason let tens thousands people get sick die today. vaccine given million people problems.

The FDA horrible throughout pandemic lots blood hands. carelessly interact ups chances severe mutation mean another variant might render vaccinated peoples immunity something low enough put us back square one.. elderly risk.

We already severe mutations already existing vaccines take care them. scientific basis months distancing let blow right way prevent restart we'll potentially dangerous variant selfish. would considered common sense.

It common sense, fear unknown basis back up. Might well build bunker never exit case meteorite hits Earth, I'm fear mongering.. let virus breed amongst we're playing fire here. Loosened restrictions like last summer would fine, trying go back normal we're clear take us steps back want to.

You fearmongering. Trying convince others afraid unknown (sEvEre mUtaTion) exactly definition fearmongering.  informal ""rule"". actually leader party. Yeah good old days ignored it, drank half bottle jack night beat ever loving fuck wife kid, eventually ate loud end shotgun 50s.

You know, like real men. Thanks explaining, thought would obvious  open it. vast majority risk groups vaccinated hospitalizations deaths decrease something line flu season, majority population is, almost nothing. Without need creepy spooky app. going vaccinate everyone anyway right? also imply helpful all? course they’ve wrong though, it’s brand new disease we’re learning real time. doctors talking high profile settings (because already plenty ways find expert opinions besides Fauci’s) probably add “wrong” opinions public discourse result. 

I’m saying opinions bad. definitely find giving interviews whatnot. I’m saying might US’s best interest government start highlighting doctors level Fauci. communicator chief comes pandemic, trust American’s real asset, necessarily expertise subject. 

The US, unfortunately, sizable anti-science contingent. Adding doctors disagreeing White House briefings tv reinforce scientists don’t know talking can’t agree. Communication crucial mastery point.

Edit: course, you’re German, completely understand getting sick Fauci articles subreddit! Makes sense, time means can't rely herd immunity protect people can't vaccinated (allergies etc) still huge numbers infected kids around. many doses EU paid? delivered already? Where's source.  Exactly...and anyone screams ""it's right refuse"" discrmination means...it business's policy. salty, average neighbor Russia.
Good luck Putin's vaccine. I've trying part still can't catch damn thing. know grand total 2 people caught it. 2 days headaches sinus pressure went back normal.    Technically no. They've come results. said last year think August IIRC vaccine gone trials thst vaccines need order approved. moderna vaccine made like 2 days back January 2020 there's reason heard November last year need trials show actually works. Makes sense. added new finding also something keep monitoring US, efforts look variants genetic sequencing lagged behind UK. fact we've seen UK ""may result robust genomic surveillance program,"" Fauver said.

Did even read article?

You make sound like engineered British lab released upon world. People perceived overly negative future virus Maybe. many movies built idea Keep mind abstain alcohol time take Sputnik V **Assuming serial interval 6–9 days, calculated median R0 value 5.7 (95% CI 3.8–8.9).**

Dude. need least month earlier though sothey get immune need everyone agree. interesting hearing US anti-vaccine sentiment. definitely seem confined one specific region, that's sure. let’s change topic....why even it’s say “I agree”? good trait people have. disappointing even redditors advocating mask January due asia events, anthony fauci went literally source basic reproductive number (R0; defined average number secondary cases attributable infection index case case introduced susceptible population) ranged 2.2 2.7 (1,3–5). think you’re looking follow youtube podcast explains clearly points format doesn’t cram minutes. evolutionary lens #65, aren’t anti-vax ignore discussion possible lab origination cuts information could useful vaccine development even potentially helpful currently scenario information made come different conclusion. said specifically said masks work people take PPE Healthcare workers.

Truly road hell paved good intentions scenario.  send link site provides data looking at? one ""population centers"" disregarding everything else. teacher, would love get vaccine next school year begins. summer without lockdowns would bonus too. pro slavery, so... It’s worse that. 

A facility non-vaccinated personnel could face liability future infections spread facility.

There crap ton good news, really work find negative. story American, anti-vaccine sentiment certainly strictly American phenomenon. I'm list people willing accept leftover doses go bad store

Ok, freaking promising. Would great get data time conduct another clinical trial single dose efficacy, like initially planned to. Luckily, mass vaccinations could provide us info soon.

When Fauci says ""back normal"" he's talking basically completely normal (stadiums packed, full workplaces, etc.), going back 50% restaurant capacity outdoor concerts 25% capacity capped 2000 people.

But, can't lop 25% herd immunity goal lots overlap infected getting vaccinated. mid low single digit difference account got natural immunity.  understand Israel point view vaccinating it’s citizens first. Looks like done weeks. Afterwards, Israel excuse. provide vaccine Palestinians Israel citizens access vaccine. think Israel provide vaccine Palestinians now? Yes also see Israel dragging feet.  plenty actual things worry about, need make new things worry :).

I would worry boosters. vaccines shown effective lasting also effective variants.  want take extended family photo inside open air building. Unless block travel countries vaccines distributed there. also provide money help vaccinations poorer countries. Ok? And? analysis here?  assuming state ACTUALLY vaccinating people. 

We're 3rd worst state comes using vaccine supply, behind Kansas Alabama - 57% used. We're 5th worst overall comes percent population.  It’s comparing apples oranges!

Yes know that, I'm still fucking excited fucking getting it. 

Though bad allergic reaction shrimp like 10 years ago used epi pen I'm little concerned that. offense isn’t old enough qualify anyway? realize AstraZeneca received billion pounds gov funding right? Moderna received billion dollars U.S. government. Pfizer received hunreds millions funding German government. 

Saying Russian gov funded vaccine research completely normal expected considering wanted first push successful vaccine sick population devastate already shitty economy. 

I seen scientists criticising data published Lancet literally nothing suggest vaccine work. Perhaps overlap first responders healthcare population, quickly moving past phase people. crazy part me. Seems simple. 

Go ahead right give vaccines. Today.  done put kids back classes 1-1.5 months. would seem age wouldn’t need jump line, would front line. She’s great human. Wait it... wait it....

*"" Derges, 63-year-old Republican ""* studies determining this? aren't?  assume Target follow suit. right root issue.

People problem risk understand much larger risk that. Specifically:

* 0.01%, like 1.5% chance dying, 150x said.

* infected die, best science currently available says there's approximately 1 3 (33%) chance long term permanent damage lungs, blood vessels, nerves, parts body infection, leading shorter lives chronic illnesses.

* Even permanently affected, still carry virus someone kill permanently damage.

* virus replicates you, gives chances mutate something dangerous... might might harm process, new variant might eventually cause thousands deaths.


Ultimately, misinformation ignorance tends fuel belief lot people there's small chance dying everyone else fine.... wishful thinking. right. see happening (I mean, much want happen, there's bias there) - seems worth around.

Awesome, let's go get PS5.'  terrible human Fucking why? drop cases wiggle room people go eat get drunk. drop means keep keep people safe. current vaccines rolled useless than? keep reading 'less effective,' that's it.

If new strains already wild, prevented becoming dominant without new vaccine?

Or new strains transmittable, severe/deadly?

I can't see global population attempting half-ass social distancing mask wearing another year. Something's got to.give.

I know hindsight 20/20, vaccines probably rolled Phase 2 trials distributed 'super spreaders.' skipped worst part though India / Pakistan people built much childhood immunity viruses developed countries. trend seen African countries. developed country harder hit Covid  sure HOPE so. school district saying students (I'm junior high school, currently) probably wont return fall, even we'll hybrid learning schedule entire year wearing masks whole time. past couple weeks seen/heard couple stories cases DC area. Brazil data pretty severe cases reassuring me. Eh well. Summer time masks anyway. county hospitals, doctors forced. Don’t try glorify doctors much, work many correct mistakes bunch times. oh yea heard protest. Unreal! vaccinate thousands young people probably die even got virus push regular Joe's back line watch something weeks summer? vaccinate celebrities we're it, since watch shows movies time now. Tell it. I’ve struggling 2 weeks now. severe shortness breath blessed bc equipment treat also knowledge. told friends family reconsider opinions vaccine go get vaccinated. joke. seem ignore fact it’s mutating evade natural immunity potentially become deadlier. Oh spreads people symptoms rapidly close spaces. 

What don’t understand? Let ride won’t work Well fuck end? vaccine ineffective new variants back square one. time vaccine variant new version show impervious one. Itll endless cycle. long expect us continue bullshit? Probably giant snowstorm northeast made impossible lot people travel get vaccinated. Also, Dodger Stadium site got shut weekend thanks anti-vax protestors. N95s exhalation valves one-way, outwards. course see breath. JNJ expect produced 1B single-dose vaccine end year. billion big number.  understand it’s everybody, tried like CBD? maybe get hands marijuana everybody’s cup tea always helps headaches. usually eat lot salt drink around 10 bottles water day (I love water) Ah, fine. also like people running around spreading virus considering roads ass. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yup. like trying lose weight starving yourself. video game people would randomly start talking death rate around guy got coma simultaneously explain they're talking asked.

You mean supposed fight way hospital doubles short tutorial? suspect real reason, really rubs wrong way. wish honesty here, come say X vaccine coverage masks stay ease enforcement. None hemming hawing sterilizing immunity. responsibility restrictions, think we’d surprised well honesty plays even it’s pleasant news. reason truth feels like we’re treated like children, worst case feels like we’re fed propaganda. Every state mega site NJ closed 2 days. vaccine trials literally looked things. lots people double-blind clinical trials got antibody tests done see whether placebo actual vaccine.

Having antibodies mean guaranteed get sick covid, mean cannot spread do. means body ability launch defense virus. Tell people died, families. Good. late IMHO. Show Julie Nolke's videos. ought sum maybe opposite Trump let 400k die 11 months shit load evidence suggests tighter restrictions little stop spread virus.

Half-assed restrictions lack community support little stop spread US seems epicentre denialism.

Certainly countries there’s shit load evidence restrictions helped lot. Unfortunately expected. Nursing homes hotspots flu contagious diseases well. part house old sick people part many poorly managed understaffed.  thinking along lines 28 days later......  biggest pro-vacer Big Pharma fan, take them. Living LA, lucky get Rona, 92 y.o. dad...Even though 10% us vacinated, rollover effect might account 50% drop cases, yuuuuge... seem pretty damn selfish help close geographical ally *at all* extremely vulnerable groups US vaccine supplies constantly getting upgraded like this. makes logical, scientific sense well morally, that's USA you. Maybe still think Canada ""national security threat"". follow CDC guidance, Department Public Instruction, North Carolina Department Health Human Services guidance wearing masks staying socially distanced, there’s lot transmission within schools,” Hoke said.

Yeah, big if. lot going world covid. cost spreading disease setting kids lifetime failure (pulling kids away education full year set many back life) worth it. Teachers die low rate. Kids get show basically zero symptoms almost health risks associated it. shortsighted view covid issue world become way prevalent public health experts worth would aggressively pushing back narrative. 

Also even suggesting base policy around potentially unknown side effects know devastating effects actions insane. Borderline evil bring reasons keep kids schools. like forgot danuelo House Doctors getting understand science training biology, organic chemistry, etc. also understand peer review process, scientific method, things taught best glossed EMTs, Paramedics I’m sure nursing schools sons schools puts video eat everyone doesn’t talk unmasked. Obvi perfect, helluva lot better keeping school reason. Agreed. I've hardcore, locked hermit since start pandemic, 100% agree threat overwhelming hospital system done, open everything back up.

The goal never ""eliminate deaths"". practical possible. Covid become like influenza - threat keep eye on, something pause world point.

The obvious exception get variant spikes hospitalization even vaccine.

The good news is, think US government *wants* keep restrictions place longer necessary. Even blue state governors taking heat feeling loss tax revenue think anything may probably open bit earlier should. “Lockdown now, lockdown forever! Education, economics mental health damned!”🙄  agree completely, still say schools open. stunning generational betrayal keep closed light decisions. technically dropped little today, think small fluctuation around stable level ~1.3M/day. I'd like see number go higher, may changes made system. Oh great even vaccine going screwed eventually? fucks sake expecting bullshit end couple months! Oh, teacher? everyone act like countries already crushed virus? Australia, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, Vietnam. Heck even Isle man, learn live oh right totally forgot snow season east coast. used westcoast weather bad. also didn’t people flying world know what’s worse mild side effects vaccine - actually contracting disease. hope educating around longterm isnt nearly bad yours. sill occasionally fatigue tachycardia though got late April.

You probably lot, im sorry u heard this... upped fluid salt intake? helped some, esp earlier long covid worse never seemed like would get better. bought G2 gatorade powder tried drink waaay fluid ever typically had. Noreaster hit half east cost. appointments today cancelled due much snow is.

Where NJ, got foot half snow. Hopefully next days, there'll catch Classroomst'd've Lmao real though country we're given choice Pfizer sinopharm think people chose sinopharm; reasoning behind traditional vaccine new technology. Good! Listen pediatricians mental health experts. longer kids school, wider achievement gaps get rich poor, worse youth mental health decays families suffer. Reddit cites news articles. I'm talking coment section obviously. installment plan end fundamentally permanent. little flu going around year wonder flu vaccines better next year less variations target? Yay yes read article cause unlike come information bullshit claims simply satisfy ego  high hospitalisation rate though, poses existential threat. shitty situation everyone - doubt that. nothing worth spreading virus even before. Teachers died. Kids get it, we're beginning understand long-term consequences bodily health infection. 

I think handle months virtual classrooms. world teacher's fault? deflecting owning fact school closures permanent impacts students. Schools proven negligible terms transmission, anecdotal evidence "" oh outbreak local school"" merit supported facts statistics. man absolute fraud. kicked fucking job That's thinking. want see anyone wearing mask go grocery shopping example, even vaccinated would know??? 

It much easier enforce: everyone wear masks store.

Versus: wear mask show proof vaccination totally untrained store worker going verify one one... right take action correctly. future must simply close virus take hold. Nip bud were. age science technology, should't putting medieval death tolls, otherwise advancement even for? think look India well herd immunity setting daily vaccinations going lower? via Bloomberg like think virus real I'm sure that's understanding it. tree liberty must watered blood senior citizens! God bless America! That's true, flights South Africa UK suspended can't enter UK South Africa last 10 days. UK resident enter indirectly isolate 10 days.  missed perfect opportunity play Zombie Plague prank. happens adverse reaction CVS? higher up. schools NY closed? They’re trying best keep clicks. It’s turning “only murders reported” type reporting Let occupy place summer long? mainstream media much trouble putting negative spin everything. Luckily follow twitter folks smart keep sane looking numbers right? Florida's cases clearly going along every state three weeks now. Hell yesterday least amount cases since Mid-November India many tropical countries mechanism store cold -18.That's many use sinovac Covishield. Yes, Covid-19 attacks lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas, intestines, heart brain. attacks immune system. People recovered reported headaches, shortness breath chronic fatigue.

Yes, survived, health taken major hit. Half people know think Coronavirus. Wuhan locked down. like ""Dude, overwhelmed countries' hospitals dozen cases came back Wuhan—and nobody gave shit giving colds year ago"" Well see, thing called ""due process law""... Teachers working class lose-lose situation thanks appalling leadership choices society really value either them. frustrates endlessly see insults towards teachers parents volleyed back forth threads like this. watched V 80’s ... naming vaccine could little ominous. check surface traces virus whether also walls. that's probably do. 

Many days weeks later contact tracing? seem possible. miss? yikes particular protest right wing, anti-vaxxers extremes sides. “Childish” cries dude misrepresents views whilst speaking me, denies that’s did, acts though it’s responsibility spell said views though acting good faith - course lead yet good faith dialogue.

Again, think I’m one who
should embarrassed here, exchange speaks well way, hilarious. India costly even store -18. news saying novavax study showed 49% efficacy SA strain. Idk find actual study. Wake didn’t prevent public buying them, none buy. Doctors nurses treating covid patients could barely get them. school set several extra-large tents outside students sit tables behind plexiglass dividers eat lunch. it’s cold, they’ve got propane-based heaters there. It’s awkward, it’s better send entire class kids quarantine one kid tests positive, would happen crammed inside normal-sized classroom can’t socially distance. thought Novavax high efficacy? 49% figure from? works school systems put strenuous safety precautions. school system cousinfuck appalachian district seem believe considering COVID running rampant schools here. infectious dose extrapolated animals.

Ok, COVID-19? give iteration 5 level 1.56% concentration picked up, rapidly downhill there.

This makes sense. essentially saying already gotten virus, there's less left. Uh, yeah? 

And first iteration enough get infected, enough get infected. even enough touch multiple things, even multiple spots. Say school desk covered COVID. every spot going touched uniformly. Even one spot 5th iteration (meaning already picked it, bad), touch another spot 'disinfection' methods become standard practice open question whether protection gained actually inactivating virus. much due simply washing wiping virus away.

What mean this? washing/wiping away also part cleaning. wiping away (even partially), that's good thing. 

Also, there's stuff like U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) list disinfectants use virus causes COVID-19. Although products tested specific virus, they're known work other, harder-to-kill sounds like saying America's healthcare system best world.  run nose pretty quick course, science nothing media. Yet governments still act way supports narrative media creating 60% effective adjusting HIV positive patients over-represented study teachers begin resisting return person education becomes fault. They’re worn White House too... rightful press ran cannot reach herd immunity via infection, true, become “prior infection affect herd immunity” true. Long Covid could still career-ending athlete. missing Olympics much consequential regular Joe missing another regular watch something weeks summer?

This huge though. Hundreds millions people would enjoy hours (Covid-safe) entertainment investment thousand vaccine vaccinate celebrities we're it, since watch shows movies time now.

Now catching on. something closer market allocation vaccines, Hollywood would operating close full speed generating vast $ amounts US IP exports tax revenue. Instead movie industry crippled regular Joe paying taxes. see boss ross.
Real Milestones arbitrary. mark miles road. So, some.
Numbers vaccinations matching cases relation models. milestones important points models. instance, something like ' 70% people receive vaccine average 85% efficacy r0 drop 1' would lead non-arbitrary milestone. So, others.  Barely. 1.351 dominant strain novavax even get approved 49% efficacy. J&amp;J would barely clear 50% approval threshold. Please let first come first serve basis. know several people qualify vaccine take it. frustration may make sound ignorant heartless kills hearing people bad talk vaccine day qualify call poison etc. Massive snow storm NE blame.

Yes, hope could quickly move convert existing facility small production site (would give production Covid vaccines start final use site clinical production runs).  fell ya, discovered would able made compliance GMP that’s bad reason. I’m freedom choice, aren’t getting better vaccine. agree, can't argue. Except note strategy implemented would need massive public buy-in compliance, means convincing vast majority people possible.

All people see pushing say, ""look outlier countries crushed virus coincidentally happen part world."" They'll much better that. thank you! I’m 100 percent. It’s generational betrayal, puts working class, single parents, children essential workers huge disadvantage. could also prevent aircraft accidents quintuple redundant systems doubled maintenance checks accept level risk. hand *do* require eg ETOPS compliance aircraft it’s free-for-all.

If you’re suggesting accept risks ‘shit happens’, would willing accept speed limits, DUI rules, requirement manufacturers install seatbelts/airbags/ESC cars, double marked lines, red lights, crash test safety requirements, brake lights, indicators?

Why willing accept road constraints comes covid protection want Wild West? agree that. Glad made RIP financial situation that. Hopefully was/is wealthy GFM set up. There’s reason hospital workers first line vaccine. likely exposed expose others virus. did. also don’t pharma industry anymore like used invest in.

Hopefully find way bring back. that's said. care people want wait not. want wait - totally get it, fine me! whatever want. works me. Sorry threw acronym irrelevant thread unknown everyone without context. change fact full shit.

Still, know even larger restaurants, spread proliferate. Netherlands national health system. privatized. California 70% deaths per day per capita right now, California rapidly catching Florida. Worked well West Virginia using Pharmacies. think variant spread right since vaccinated people, advantage mutations. question remains tho is: finally vaccinate world, happens? sure getting voted. protest important enough break law, willing face consequences. thinking earlier know people vaccine people disease.

I'm curious got impression did, though. spike protein already 20 epitopes. already virus needs acquire many mutations achieve total immune escape spike.

Including mRNA would complicate never done single mRNA. spike reduces risks additional production complications (which biggest problem). 20/20 hindsight easy suggest since know works, include nucleocapsid mRNA well, time kicked nobody knew would even work.

The Chinese CanSino inactivated virus vaccine sort suggest, though, since includes whole inactivate virus immune system respond spike. may riskier include virus comes autoimmune side effects (if assume spike works sufficiently well, including proteins increase side effect risk). go away? long last?

You're either 17 troll. either case, complete waste time. good life. There's need us ever interact again. NYC—someone know Monday appt Javits (huge center) moved today. It’s moved Thursday. We’re gonna get vaccines out, give us minute shovel wonder it’s bots. Realistically that’s going happen. People aren’t going sacrifice another summer. it’s even purely selfish. Time earth limited deaths hospitalizations drop drastically people need socialize mental health again. Supposedly, vaccinated supposed drink alcohol weeks vaccination. irony. counts dropped since Christmas ar still awful.. we're 10k today surpassing regular intervals. think better situation that.

I bet could spread virus maybe little bit first time got infected vaccination. get infected post vaccination, probably broader immune response second time, able spread it. right vaccines, current pandemic. facilities [scheduled complete we're still mercy European/American manufacturing Pfizer/Moderna.

The man lied masks. Maybe tell platitudes families listened him, didnt wear masks, died Covid. put way: process regulatory approval scale quite nicely. Even Germany took mere weeks get approval new plant (Marburg). reason repeat process.

Right bottleneck seems highly specialized production mRNA carrier particles shrugging really help here. Masks major feature successes Australia.

And solution strategy banning people 65 getting vaccine. god... think part worry possibility virus replicate upper airways organs successfully block infection due vaccine. guess would require immune response vaccine penetrate upper airways. general sounds odd, body manages fight infection least spatially, virus titres would sum dramatically reduced, leading less infections. anyone knows this, please fill in. mean work force? Sensible. get shipped over! forget, Indians pretty much resistant infections easily seen West.

Ask westerners eating food drinking water India see difference. cautious worried catching infections. hindsight always biased guess

Is hindsight lot people saying march ? efficacy means worse J+J. efficacy actually matter, stopping people getting sick good vaccine there.

AZ people producing vaccine. SII biggest vaccine manufacturing world producing 1 billion doses. 13 countries also producing vaccine. - anyone else. Supply issues occurred vaccines - Oxford signed deals capacity produce 3+ billion doses 2021 - anyone else far partnering AZ allowed given nature agreement.

The vaccine highly effective stopping symptoms 70% far 100% effective trials stopping deaths hospitalisations. recent data shows cut transmission 67%. That's ""better nothing"". Texas

Wonderful choice /s press conference 12 January, Ricardo Palácios, Medical Director Instituto Butantan said Sinovac’s relatively low efficacy rate 50% due rigorous standards counts infection among trial participants. Institute included six types cases results: asymptomatic, mild, mild, two levels moderate, severe, western vaccine makers generally included mild, moderate, severe categories. Brazil’s trial also largely made frontline health care workers. ""They exposed virus may explain relatively low efficacy rate,"" said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow global health Council Foreign Relations.""

tl;dr: Chinese vaccine talking held rigorous standard. first coronavirus infect humans they're not. lots data show vaccine safe effective people age groups. Notably efficacy data people 65 Phase II immune responses people 65. frustrating see people incredibly narrow minds argue spitefully vehemently based idea UK government played Russian Roulette millions lives.

I’m even going dignify comment asking source. brazenly incorrect studying Russia. None Russian friends trust Russian vaccine. measures definitely working slowly get numbers down, fear comes play consider much infectious variant is. cant relax measures numbers go (not enough yet, mind you) you’ll stuck 10k cases day time.

also, amount people getting tested dropped relatively significant amount, amount positive tests hasnt gone much, isnt good sign. healthcare system still struggling right now, infectious strain doesnt bode well that, theres definitely reason people worried. Absolutely! phase 3 Friday efficacy data due mid feb. 👀 think media governments general really want early shouting vaccines reduce transmission result vaccinated people disregarding social distancing rules, turn lead everyone another peak happening.

Really hoping US turn around year, looking decent NY atm could change due cold weather slowing vaccinations. However snow/cold keeps people going out. Karen’s feel every vaccine then?  Sorry, allow comments like this. Check r/RandomKindness instead. *Do* foreigners right travel US? far know, US citizens exempt restrictions.

Which course highlights useless are, like China travel ban imposed last year, ""stolen rights"" point... mean, maybe I'm dense, ... possible got pneumonia Covid? done ages ago. Florida last summer worse panicking states. can't verify money going claimed going.  much able still carry transmit disease think entirely possible honest last comment, something believed deep down, even skeptical surface. 

Yeah, guess that's u/huntingwhale deleted linked said, nobody criticized particularly distrustful Russian government. 

When people jump far-reaching conclusions, extremely limited data, distorted selective reporting fearmongering mainstream media, say shit like ""I'd rather inject bleach vein take Russian vaccine"", nice way saying ""I'd rather kill myself..."", feel like we've got problem, like certain level animosity, uncalled-for. sure, free trust distrust government vaccine, but, first all, people also free point hypocrisy, double standards inconsistencies views, second all, distinction Russian government Russian scientific community/regular Russians, vaccine question made Putin, lose limb admitting Russians made working vaccine suspicions proven incorrect. grow person - admitting mistakes misjudgments, avoid repeating them, deleting previous comments making look like never wrong. Ok, I'll sum up:

\-They getting bunch new infections, herd immunity.

\-Yet getting bunch new infections.

\-Reinfection one best ways explaining that.

It PROOF reinfection; rather, one best-fit explanations given know. Wow. Finally decent looking news us nicotine users. 

I unaware website existed. Thanks sharing link. I'll make sure check back October study complete.  friends want hide room next year? lucky guy.litreally skipped 2020 Maybe someone know answer... vaccinated still need wear masks. majority people don’t vaccine? that’s case, able stop wearing masks? trying start anything genuinely curious. Right understand that, that's mentioned nucleocapsid protein inactivated virus.

I doubt immune system would learn ""both"" required, would give epitopes learn. time though epitope could interact immune systems random people cause autoimmune disorders side effects. Although sort know, paper there's risk that.

Plus packing mRNA two different proteins there, may need twice overall volume dose, need additional synthesis mRNA strand. There's also ""mixed"" appropriately production process nanoparticles already complicated enough. trying something new complicated better eliminate variables possibly can.

Inactivated OG, China able pump months started YOLO vaccinating people significant risk (foreign travellers VIPs?) without anything beyond basic safety trials. expected would work well enough reasonably safe compared virus. Real life Rick Grimes! Cept we’re kinda still here. Kinda. Arrest fine them. donate money staff involved fight. like get pepper sprayed nine year old upset fully grown adult blocking people saving lives shut place down. distinctly remember reading news article way back said people receiving vaccine needed drink alcohol around month after. remember Russian drinking stereotype joked bad news. lucky S.O.B. baby 3 weeks ago stay hospital apparent pro masks. nurses would come say fine didn’t want put mask since theirs. put mask anyway right thing do. doctor come even chance process there, asked us put masks on. told respected lot it’s educating people take shit seriously, would hope medical professionals would first often case. Disney World January thinking exact thing lol faaaiiiirrrr get freshman senior...  disease 100% fatal, I'm confident immune system I've built withstand natural pathogen. Why? Sincerely curious Poor guy, wish better news him.

That must one helluva “While Out” notepad next bed. Lazyass Millennials￼ hear Missouri, less want visit there.  Canada supplies vital materials required make vaccine. 

You could see supplier enough, actually good news based Europe great relationship, called UK... awkward! Well....Then put risk possible poor outcome thereby decrease population healthcare workers need help fight thing.

Sound smart. People tried mock belittle vaccine Russian. look silly now, never get discourse trust government like United States country U.K. widely distrust anything Russia does.  Absolutely, fantastic. go hard strains OG variant first time around, extra security. hope they're going lightly tracing here. Dude, I've reddit 8 years still gold. fair, comment much main newspaper main COVID epicenter paywalled people wonder it’s epicenter, educate peasants, even new state regulations often behind paywalls going pay learn new laws won’t even follow care existed absolutely isn't. 1 case WA, 1. kids brought back home school week. 

I absolutely can't fathom hard US, UK many places. really lucky here. Coachella cancelled ago makes feel better. Put cock, care! give juice! fk wrong people? want get vaccinated, whatever. loss. preventing others access? WTF? KUHN: Oka says experts warned last fall third wave infections coming November, government busy subsidizing tourism dining out. suspend subsidies case numbers exploded last month. Today, government announced extend state emergency another month. due end March 7, 18 days scheduled start Tokyo Olympic torch relay.

I keep seeing repeating issue across globe that's tourism.

The UK ""Eat help out""

The US... Well... think globe understands issues already.  even know *anyone* gotten COVID twice Makes damn good sense. I've done MATH deeply unhappy Yang make speedy recovery.  thinks that's bad, wait hears entire world reverted martial law order protect senior citizens expand control multi billion dollar organizations live 30 minutes away too! girlfriend time -- gotten annual pass. get use one time, though. :( add different report. ER Jersey City NJ exactly one week ago, literally single person maskless 7-8 hour stay. (I'm fine, far still COVID symptoms me!) like eat high 5 kid asshole... gonna touch anything self. Bidets lovely poop fats bidets remove that..that requires soap . pristine think. water fine, paper fine. 4 minute abs! matter? trying say here? ok kids guinea pigs novel disease protecting  symptoms resembling sinus infection start covid 19? sinus infection symptoms (along post nasal drip), though pollen count really high live might something it.   fun every last shred virus extinguished! seriously far going nowadays? I'm young enough, ans anxieties towards covid primarily bringing home parents move post-vaccine. 

We really try go anywhere, deliver groceries doordash, family stuff. would suck get now.

But doctor refusing refill prescription go basic checkup (no changes) they're giving info far covid policies. frustrating feelings mixed going in. 33 million doses given. That’s large enough sample. Prisons, like nursing homes, breeding grounds covid. It’s stop infections. Fuck Zoom parties massive.

*slams delete button glee* actually quite easy make combined vaccine, put vial. MMR vaccine literally 3 component vaccines combined one. 

The tough part trials. discover interactions ensure safety. efficacy tough prove confounding factors endpoint (COVID levels going different influenza levels, scale incident threshold?).

They quite easily, real work comes later. Actually, do. hedging. They’re saying don’t want say “back normal x% vaccinated” wrong.

I don’t problem hedging, problem people present hedge actual opinion rather cautious statement. over. old people are.vaccinated everyone else.by end month. /s $VAX 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Weekend 2 days + Snowstorm number comparison say summer first wave? Also government offering financial support people lockdown? timelines hope grt everyone vaccinated given awfully slow roll mean Pfizer going make 50 billion?  Hardy worth funding politicians.  2019: ""Hyperpolarized toxic social media / internet use causing X societal problems""

2020: "" Let's eliminate person socialization put everyone front screen 24/7""  I’m still clear would continue restrict activity I’m personally vaccinated, 15-20% Americans refuse get vaccine. reach point vaccine hesitancy impediment herd immunity, I’m fine getting rest way old-fashioned way. can’t stand it. wedding coming guests aren’t coming due COVID concerns. hard feelings, totally understand, you. like “let’s celebrate virtually week after!” No, let’s please not. celebrate person later year, it’s really okay. Maybe should, IDK, shut transmission humans via vaccination? Well northeast got buried snow. saw video huge snowball fight NYC I’m seeing people bashing people. 

Most wearing masks. Let enjoy themselves. USC poll showed young adults think 11% chance dying virus. That’s thousands times high, it’s literally higher chance grandparents die virus. Utterly insane many people programmed. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* variants, vaccines probably protect bad symptoms infection. you’d probably still isolate got sick variant, would almost certainly need hospitalized get vaccine kicks infection likely annoying &amp; less likely scary. Herd immunity = enough immune response enough people prevent virus growing exponentially (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 30, etc etc) population.

Covid19 challenging contagious, unlike say flu (which funny people used compare flu like nothing, circa year ago). Makes sense, pretty much entire northeast closed 2 days due snow... periodically keep checking CNN they’re pushing “we still need masks distancing even vaccination”. naive point spring summer comes dam going break people vaccinated gonna start want ? feels like goalposts constantly moved. responding comment stating strain requires 10× higher antibodies. great news. sorry LD/SD? We've known least 4 months now.

Probably slog another 2 months ""at least 6 months"" get ""at least 12 months"". think massive snowstorm impacting lot states. going last reply write, clearly reading well.

Palestine gets relatively little aid compared Israel. Another issue obtaining vaccine international blacklisting due Israeli-Palestinian conflict casting shadow vendors selling Palestine, thus even could buy vaccine, they're back line.

The Times Israel acceptable source Israeli-Palestinian relations. apologize believe otherwise, newspaper interest promoting Israeli government's position decrying Palestine's. 

I ignore question. strange question answer it. Palestinian government undoubtedly tried buy vaccine. cannot obtain due myriad reasons listed many not.

Let repeat seem ignoring everytime say it. Palestinians placed phone call order vaccines. cannot get vaccines. Israeli government, according international law, must help due Occupying Power.

You also seem making lying things. not. ties Israel Palestine way. researched distribution vaccines occupied areas (both historical COVID). turned 30 weeks ago nothing. depressing. can't wait throw blowout lost 30 year old birthdays. many friends turned 30 year. ""Covid hospitalizations remained zero consecutive 14 years now. here's still doule-mask."" absolutely absurd. Completely bonkers.  went weeks ago pretty easy. Dentists offices already pretty sterile. mine added plastic screens protect reception area besides change much. asked said close full schedule. Yes, need proactive testing quarantining available random lockdowns. New vaccinations declined past 6 days US. Hmm... Link article read government incompetency comes shipments eligibility  CDC updated guidance long ago upto 6 weeks. 28 day hard limit that's pfizer/moderna wanted get results asap 3/4 week gao allowed makes think they're competent? I'm sure agree though, public safety public confidence two separate things, albeit inter-related. others commented below, many people going feel comfortable resuming normal lives fully vaccinated, even deaths hospitalizations low. 

This seems imply small percentage people declining get vaccine going fuck us. Good news, maybe makes argument spending much time trying convince reluctant focusing efforts expediting needles arms want it. season 2 autumn  would probably anything, vaccine preventative, cure. already virus time vaccinated, immune system already fighting it. 💎 🙌 It’s assumed. ""Zoom"" ""virtual"" trigger words me.


Does anyone even """"""go"""""" anymore? remember someone work arranged virtual Christmas party disappointed barely anyone showed up.


And even bands trying get people pay ""virtual"" concerts. would read article, require wear mask *in areas social distancing impossible*. big crowd people, matter inside outside, need wearing mask. 

I've multiple outdoor concerts music festivals would super spreader events happened now, could see sky give magic anti covid powers.  Considering source directly contradicts cdc every reputable source come with, maybe lay doom porn. mom got first Pfizer dose yesterday, get mine Friday! lucky. anyone know vaccines stop getting infected variants? still going careful getting vaccinated course, want peace mind get others sick somehow asymptomatically infected even vaccine. masks help, Fauci said “masks aren’t needed TIME” low PPE healthcare workers,

That fucking dangerous lie could used Defense Protection Act make PPE; think mask mandates possible Asian countries? could make needed in-house done thing. see scientific method real time. HIW SCIENCE WORKS. 

We already science masks coming Asia, made magically better? bullshit excuse CDC used avoid getting COVID tests South Korea, use ended wasting weeks valuable time. I've never gotten facts COVID states, always Asian sources. makes science worse ours? Nothing! took copying everything doing, no, Americans damn special, pathetic.

Anyway, I'm spoons discussion. condolences remember, government responsible. AKA suck march Zoom party planners! hadn’t half-assed control measures time last year, wouldn’t fix! Well, lying. can't say sure PROVEN. *are* vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, meaning still spread disease without sick it. christian health care workers Germany nuns regular people. Also roman catholics care pope. pope tells us condom use contraception evil roman catholics Germany use form contraception. Assuming it, chances serious long term effects Covid? news see “long term heart problem” headlines kind scares me.

Given age underlying conditions, chances serious illness long term complications low. honestly risk less novel respiratory diseases. best isolate disease passes though.


Hope feel better soon. every park like that. parks middle nowhere maybe get 50 visitors day across thousands acres. [citation needed] “lots data” over-65 patients, French German regulators certainly would like see it. applies whole ""infection mean immunity"" bit would defy physics basic understanding viruses. naturally, turd burglars pick cases reinfection among millions cases make point ""herd immunity work!"" misapplication science. we've tons cases people getting re-infected. heck talking data?

Maybe formal report data there. year. takes get re-infected.  Agreed. article say data hazy/muddy. one compares Japan's [Daily New Cases U.K.'s [Daily New Cases since Dec., one would able see amazingly similar ... without single shot vaccines. Japan claim early signs success without vaccination campaign? Lmao. Given U.K. ramping vaccinations end December takes weeks body produce immune response, would start looking real-world efficacy data mid-March, especially Israel. Also never said anything grammar lol. advantage? Yes 
is entire reason? 
is excuse rest world bad cuz island nations? No

this like failing uni exam like well duh studied much spend time playing Fortnite every day. like suck ok? huh ok, I'll read thanks production/dissemination literally billions people. There’s also chain pharmacies administer vaccines, number even higher access vaccines.   good know vaccine makers work &amp; governments' health agencies working kind studies needed approve these. likely something like flu vax much smaller shorter study needed brand new vaccine, hundreds thousands trial participants vs 30,000 plus taken parent companies vaccine. Thats far fetched statement. Ive worn mask since May start see local deaths drop 1 100, theres way Im wearing mask. nothing natural that. Especially maintain low death count without Look numbers. discernible difference lockdown non-lockdown states. catch pretty quick second reopen. surprised someone eventually figures way combine annual flu vaccine hypothetical annual Sars-Cov-2 vaccine one injection. think mRNA future flu vaccines, know effective form vaccine here, maybe could possible work simultaneously, similar MMR vaccine immunizes people measles, mumps, rubella time. 

Obviously know would actually work, know body needs immune system fully focused fighting one mRNA based antigen immunity work out, does, could imagine relatively seamless, think would go long way making things logistically easier need vaccine annual.

But course totally clear yet either. variants showing resistance vaccines showing uniformly different vaccines. could work one vaccine creates induces antibodies especially good preventing infection transmission humans. could possible person gets one, need booster handle future variants since necessary infection mechanism could scope natural evolution virus. hypothetical, need information need see happens. current relative new mutations (E484K) make vaccines less effective, still effective enough. 

Why would need yearly one current one protects sufficiently? know yet vaccines help stay immune (protection hospitalisation death) 1.5 2 years (according Sputnik people), would need yearly vaccinations? 

We forget lot people get vaccinated quickly enough, virus less hosts mutate. would suspect would similar scenario measles. would still exist, way less prevalent, lowering chances mutations significantly, thus lessen need new vaccinations. 

Am optimistic think would done SarsCov2 get vaccinated get 2nd gen vaccination 1.5 years ? 

We compare influenza strains susceptible combination mutations SarsCov2 (8 RNA strands vs 1 RNA strands). 

Am missing something? Awesome grammar dude. I'd vote Dolly Good news, thanks fuck social media US, also germany. dont want to. heard also lot countries same. 

I guess also many experiences pharmaindustry trust. nevertheless right do. He's really fucked pandemic hard.

He actually done good things state, huge surplus budget beginning 2020, seeing infections rate states opened up, combined killing many small businesses Mea Culpa moment French Laundry, see people sick him.

That said, vote whoever opponent 2022, long another pandemic screw again, since he's good governor otherwise. Yeah countries problem man. EU content getting scientific information Moderna, Pfizer et.al hell they? know ethics information, information EXACTLY trials run etc. included study yes? US somr magic place scientific rigour lives rest world crazy. lot European countries considering getting Sputnik approved, think Europe care rigour ethics drug trials? ends public says ends. really need show fed restrictions. Umm, 70-85% americans, get 78% americans vaccinated every adult got it, get 200-220 million americans vaccinated great, way getting 70%. happen beginning scientists discussing might need boosters new problem variants develop might become like flu vaccine multiple variants one shot.

in South Africa J&amp;J prevented severe illness even prevent illness. would happy take someone comes specific vax ever likely 2 shot J&amp;J study proves effective preventing degrees illness, get 2nd shot J&amp;J booster. science disagree this. eating outdoors restaurant members household yes, much safer. 

If eating outdoors table members different household longer recommended 6 foot distance. Joe office joins lunch covid, doesn’t matter indoors outdoors- sitting across table talking laughing, inhaling infected droplets. expelled directly face. Yes windy day, might less risk. much breeze, definitely big risk. vaccinate 85% lot people immunity covid? need vaccinate 70% 85% local government oversees it, someone still needs carry -- means staying home. mean... one who's saying toilet, poll reading?

The recent article saw [this poll released Tuesday Public Policy Institute California found half Californians - 54% - approve Newsom handling job, suggesting recall effort still uphill climb. that's 65% May, height approval. mom sounding alarm virus early January. concerned think gonna big thing. Boy wrong.

My mom called all. Last week took closer look data India. Last September seemed would become affected country world absolute number victims, trend reversed infections continuously decreased last four months; today India records 10,000 infections hundred victims per day, low numbers relation enormous size country, face almost 100,000 infections thousand daily victims peak September. Overall, officially recorded victims 154,000, less United States, Brazil Mexico: considerable number absolute terms, low compared population – 111 covid deaths per million inhabitants, Europe Americas countries well 500 victims per million, thirty even thousand per million. Even countries younger India (lower median age lower percentage population 65) victims relation population: example Iraq, 321 victims per million, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), 499 victims per million. Certainly India achieved herd immunity, unless half million unrecorded victims; fall number infections bit mystery.

Looking data relating individual states / territories make India, seen distribution victims extremely uneven, handful states heavily affected others hardly touched.

One-third overall number victims concentrated state Maharashtra alone (the second populous country), whose population however represents less tenth total India; whereas combined death toll country's first third populous states, Uttar Pradesh Bihar, together represent quarter total Indian population, accounts 6% total victims.

The affected state/territory relation population Delhi, 655 deaths per million inhabitants; followed Puducherry, 646 deaths per million, Goa, 523 deaths per million, Ladakh, 470 deaths per million, Maharashtra, 453 deaths per million. five states / territories combined represent less 12% total population India.

Few states / territories located intermediate range, 200 399 deaths per million: Chandigarh (316 per million), Sikkim (218 per million), Punjab (202 per million), Karnataka. Combined, make less 3% Indian population.

Much numerous 100 199 victims per million inhabitants: Karnataka (199 per million), Tamil Nadu (170 per million), Andaman Nicobar Islands (163 per million), Uttarakhand (158 per million), Jammu Kashmir (155 per million), Manipur (144 per million), Andhra Pradesh (143 per million), Chhattisgarh (141 per million), Himachal Pradesh (140 per million), Haryana (118 per million), West Bengal (109 per million), Kerala (108 per million), Tripura (105 per million). states comprise 43% Indian population.

The remaining fifteen states / territories (which comprise 42% total population) recorded less one hundred victims per million inhabitants, thus barely touched pandemic: aforementioned Bihar (14 victims per million) Uttar Pradesh (43 per million) fall group. others Gujarat (71 per million), Madhya Pradesh (52 per million), Meghalaya (49 per million), Odisha (47 per million), Telangana (45 per million), Nagaland (44 per million), Arunachal Pradesh (40 per million), Rajasthan (39 per million), Assam (35 per million), Jharkhand (32 per million), Mizoram (eight per million) “Dadra Nagar Haveli Daman Diu” (three per million). Finally, little Lhakshadweep, 64,000 inhabitants far smallest territory India, registered victims.

Even distribution new daily cases highly uneven; presently, majority new infections come two states, Kerala Maharashtra. Kerala alone, accounts less 5% Indian population, currently records half total daily infections entire country. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

However, That's longer initial 3 week lockdown...I see many people following protocol. But, that's also pandemic. appropriate measures taken fall, could readily adhered to. What's everyone's take Florida South Dakota handled pandemic opposed to, say California New York? seems they've little restrictions throughout pandemic. mRNA vector vaccines (like one) ultimately produced DNA template. change mRNA protein, need change DNA code done (then still need testing everything, that's both). changing DNA sequence tiny bit complicated vector ones, come plasmids, bigger. Also far know production takes bit longer scale back up. details, far longest time testing again, reckon mRNA vaccines much faster giving adapted versions variants. would expect autumn, earliest late summer. anyone know efficacy first dose Moderna least prevent severe illness? know second dose (+ 1 week after), couldn’t find details first dose.

Restrictions place prevent overwhelmed hospitals, hospitalizations decline, makes sense restrictions eased well. nursing homes near fully vaccinated, hospitalizations greatly decline, elderly near fully vaccinated, hospitalization plummet. That's 20% country, that's bulk problems virus coming from.

I think even need majority adult population vaccinated hospital burden effectively eliminated. adults hospitalized get infected. Obviously still get vaccinated prevent possibility variants emerging domestically, we're talking hospital burden, we're looking pretty small percentage country needs attention. surprising result, known first efficacy results came out.

Hopefully Tesla stock already tried ""joke"", sucks. think one nuance there's ""normal"" insofar actual restrictions lifted, true sense normalcy also depend consumer behaviour, likely altered majority population vaccinated.

For example, deaths hospitalizations decline enough, prohibitions indoor dining venues like movie theatres may lifted. there's non-trivial portion population still avoid places personally vaccinated.

Yeah, new, quantum world hail again? AZ vaccine seemingly confirmed UK right wait 12 weeks 2nd dose, one really even eligible 2nd dose yet. think speaks people overcompensating second they’re let out. also speaks trap people house covid people, increase possibility spread. think NPR marginally better cable news. narrative less sensational relaxing voices. partially rely public funds access, they're going take substantively adversarial stance towards government either domestic foreign policy. also rely corporate sponsors, expect heavy criticism there. depend donations listeners skew wealthy, also colors choose report.

Better, much. literally said, outdoors can't social distance. get bottleneck trail there's big crowd people waiting together, put mask on. trail alone, fine.

I've massive outdoor concerts music festivals would 100% covid super spreader events happened now, outside enough crowd. Covid early October. lost smell, taste. sense smell back around 80% Christmas, mid-January, totally back normal. YMMV. Approval take long. get new covid vaccine Autumn approved within weeks That's simply true. I've 3 national parks last 6 months every single one required masks go indoors.

They require masks outdoors, kind mandate dumb. Herd immunity bar. let people make bar. goal posts moved enough. Bro, love daily dose shutting anti-vaccine misinformation. schedule domestic vacation USA; one stopping you! Less three months vaccine campaign 10% population gotten shots somehow people shitting instead seeing moonshot success. understand sort panic virus appeared March, limited data China thought fatality rate 3,7%.

We though stuck March forever, despite much knowledge treatment, levels healthcare need, even rolling vaccination program, stuck March.

Communication public awful studies show people genuinely think 15% catch covid die. strategy based scaring people. Now, scare went control panic ""mutations"" could lead public believe never ""safe"" make measures permanent.

I expect read entire paper less agree with. study specialists law medicine calling pandemic approach simply copying measures anti terrorism law enforcement.

But instead admitting incorrect, doubled-down incapable admitting it. Stop it. Sadly buried cold flu med companies fast head spin. Great information, thank you!

You seem really knowledgeable I’m wondering info getting 2nd Pfizer shot bit earlier 21 days.

My mom Grandma getting 2nd dose 18th day instead 21st day. sister made appointment said it’s within 4 day window, it’s fine. couldn’t find information it, know true? I’m guessing wouldn’t even give vaccine Friday it’s early!? Thanks information. Yeah it’s mad. maintains trucks cars used delivery? car fairy? makes fuel? feeds truckers road? essential jobs done home. Turns world function without accountants lawyers. much without everyone actual works real world objects.  getting second moderna shot saturday, got 0 fucks give brah.  would say, that, plus idea vaccinations safeguard rising lockdown lifted. problem original lockdowns effective reducing deaths/hospitalizations, nothing stopping spiking restrictions loosened. vaccines missing piece puzzle. beginning thought reckless states choosing reopen fast soon. states lockdowns saw surge cases (and cases worse one), added “bonus” wrecking economy. It’s pretty clear path correct one now. year claiming pandemic driven asymptomatic people narrative reason vaccine reduces transmission making people less symptomatic? 

That doesn’t pass smell test. i’ll take kids means go happy hour 2021.  Honest question , factual assumed? Every independent polling I've seen indicates majority eligible population gearing take vaccine voluntarily. Seems like big concern getting half vaccinated. least first dose shown pretty effective stops transmission :) hopefully start discussing sharing vaccines countries (although doubt it) little vulnerable almost covered. yet fail milestone vaccine delivery go chief. promised quarterly delivery numbers, missing weeks managing deliver anyways isnt failure huge difference stopping reducing transmission. quite probable scenario vaccination prevents infection lung tissue, prevent infection upper respiratory tract. Given observed efficiency vaccines, could easily limit extent infection mucosae. 


Such scenario would mean significant reduction transmission, elimination. fact find respiratory infections. might lucky first 'real' infection, localized immunity mucosae provides something akin sterilizing immunity subsequent infections. 


Finally, given super-spreaders main driver pandemic, arguably much important effect vaccination super-spreaders. stops greatly reduces transmission particular subset, problem non-super-spreaders get sterilizing immunity. majority infected never transmit infection even without vaccines. 


One theory super-spreading caused asymptomatic infection lungs. case vaccines would massively impactful - even 0 reduction transmission upper respiratory tract. 


TL;DR - we'll wait see. entirely possible effect transmission miniscule, also possible effect transmission much greater effectiveness and/or PCR-based studies post-vaccine transmission indicate. Yes, UNKNOWN NEW virus. expected.  have.

For year.

There's limit. time - heroes dangerous work idiots accessing measure protect themselves. Well there's good chance we'll forgotten coronavirus time next one comes around. U.S. good position second doses, countries dropping ball dose two. I'm Canada we've decent amount shenanigans people getting first doses able get second. friend mine ER doctor supposed get second shot week - instead, hospital informed it'll another 45 days. rightly so.

Because 30 documented 100,000,000 worldwide cases.

Keep mind opinions here, downvotes manipulated done spite emotions logic science. tell you, based medical professional friends, vaccinated people absolutely disregarding social distancing already lol Distancing never happened. like cancer warning product made California. post make people feel good, one cares. hope recovers quickly! course time, sick? pandemic taught wearing mask go public flu, strep, etc, probably pretty damn good idea prevent spread variety illnesses. misfortune come bronchitis right left lengthy, expensive vacation, still feel guilty people may infected 6-hour plane ride. mask-wearing common society then, could worn mask potentially prevented people getting sick (or worse). country two groups first? would really interesting see difference. company break contract Eu would sueing them. It’s EUs fault negotiating better contract Yh thr 2nd dose major issue. first dose already gives level protection people come back second dose anyway understand? disagreeing something here? beginning, message need flatten curve number people get sick die matter do. sometime April, became “stop death, find way ensure immortality absolutely cases you’re failure.” first message correct that’s you’re seeing every state ending outcome matter do.  explain me? understanding vaccines prime body next time infected. instead taking 10 days immune system mount response takes two you’re really contagious two days understanding opposed 10. That’s virus ever replicates enough become infectious taken immune system. vaccine decreases virus’s ability infectious lessening time physically walk around spread immune system dismantle virus replicate enough spread. correct? vaccines provide sterilizing immunity? Say want, conspiracy theorists field day past year. go school? Specially it’s college outside hometown

A concert makes sense population vaccinated No, data. There’s anecdotes could also explained immunocompromised/SOME asymptotic people producing storing adequate antibodies first infections. Basically medical anomalies. no, formal,useful even impressive numbers all. Misinformation. ""CNN watched cleaning crew airport, allowed change channel."" ~Some smart person Reddit surge burnt South Dakota, year we've pushed myth that, left unchecked, case numbers would continue rising exponentially, everyone infected dead. 

That's case.  dont economy, dont society...

And lockdowns continued fall, mass suicides streets, what's point living arent actually living. Plus what's going happen birth rates, people arent going dates right now. Especially since already wear masks flu! Regarding spacing doses 12 weeks. ""In SD/SD group, second dose, efficacy higher longer prime-boost interval: 82.4% 95%CI 62.7%, 91.7% 12+ weeks"" 
Am correct understanding confidence level 62%-91%? Scared people media fueling fear clinging narrative somehow likely months. Come bro bangers album  not. don’t think need mask outdoors hike even walking someone. However according rules posters refer hiking etiquette necessary. Awesome. long first dose 80.2% kick in?

You’ve taken two situations aren’t even remotely comparable tried apply vaccinations. better example would wearing seatbelt removes risk car crash. Adding airbag increases protection even more. 10m vaccinated. idea determined utterly fantastic achievement down.  woman amazing. can't believe never news cycle. Lol what? First all, 2% us vaccinated. 15% us already COVID.... 85% us getting vaccinated would basically 100%.

The herd immunity threshold may high can’t 100%.

So headline makes sense me. studies showing there’s much robust immune response vaccine natural infection, would imply longer, obviously studies coming year showing sure. jinx  data Sputnik V looks pretty decent. indeed rushed early, trial data catching now. Personally, opportunity, I'd get happy got others really. that's me.  CNN AI generated articles desperate pump articles nonstop looking google giving good answer. someone already virus antibodies, still transmit virus? get coughed happens others virus around (in regards contagious, transmission, etc.) Gasp - never knew that! Thanks informing me. Go homes, places business, stick 'em back paddy wagon put jail pandemic can't hurt anybody else.

You know can't jail people indefinitely without trial USA, right? Hence due process law required. 

By way, I'm favor arresting anyone breaking law. Yeah agree.  explains well book spillover.  concept SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) interplay percentage progression outbreak.

I guess would call response pseudo herd immunity it’s herd immunity among subset human population extremely artificial possibly fluid depending seasons holidays. screws overall % people expect predicated good % population acting normal. Alot also depend we're looking at? terms cases that's going really see effect transmission vaccines since need much higher % population covered.

Compared women, men tend engage high-risk behaviors generate potential contracting COVID-19 (1,4). Polls taken early first wave COVID-19 cases United States show sex differences perceived severity pandemic (20). Another US study found men likely downplay severity virus’s potential harm (21), fewer men women reported avoiding large public gatherings avoiding close physical contact others (21–23). addition, compared women many countries, including United States, men tend higher rates behaviors linked COVID-19 infection mortality, including higher rates tobacco use alcohol consumption Men also tend lower rates women handwashing, social distancing, wearing masks, effectively proactively seeking medical help (1,4,21,25,26). Many men socialized mask fear, important consider hiding fear affects men’s response COVID-19 (27). particularly important focus men respond threats like COVID-19 aggression anger. Research shows people response “tend downplay risk resistant risk reduction policies,” problematic efforts promote social distancing pandemic restrictions (27). socially constructed behaviors reduce perception susceptibility severity, translates decrease practice preventive measures, handwashing, protests pandemic-related restrictions.

Please seek help bro. want help cheer dont know how. think things get better, we've things like Spanish flu black death made back normal, well make one I'm sorry US government killed mother 2 friends. consider filing class-action lawsuit.

And get therapy, man, Jesus. caveat would say dangerous leave Covid19 circulating around, new variants may arise, specifically ones spread easily vaccines work on.

i virologist, strongly disagree assessment, two main reasons:

(1) simply choice. **not** covid circulating possible point. said doctors prettymuch since March last year *wayyyyy* past point return ""containment"". virus stay, possible eliminate it. like flu, ever present.

(2) know viruses actually leads opposite conclusion - general, longer virus circulating, less deadly becomes. there's evolutionary pressure results viruses killing less people time, there's also simple fact general, susceptible people killed (sounds cold, true) people less susceptible virus survive.

the evolutionary pressure somewhat self-explanatory, less likely virus kill host and/or significantly incapacitate it, likely able spread. virus severe puts people quickly, obviously still spread (since many viruses spread pre-symptomatic), *not well* virus milder symptoms infected people liely go business meeting lot people.


basically saying herd immunity kind irrelevant context trying ""eliminate"" covid prevent mutating. herd immunity theory prevent huge waves infections, herd immunity prevent *all* infections, certainly prevent mutations. THIS. narrative needs be:

1. many people possible need take vaccine. means YOU.
2. play ball take it, one month final dose, burn masks, go see grandma, go bar throw back cold one lick floor way out. Whatever floats boat.

Despite reduction, neutralizing titer levels B.1.351 remain levels expected Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine Works Mutations Found U.K, South Africa Variants, Lab Study Finds


It's hard keep track many articles say something like ""experts worried variants may evade vaccine"" something, read statements carefully basically people guessing worrying. Better wait actual studies analysis. far know, goes Joe, call Joe. consider common shortened form nickname, per se. even was, that's commonly used, would use it.

I mean, sure. hand, masked counties saw 6% decrease. Additionally, summer cases plummeting anyway. Where's data winter masked vs. unmasked counties? say California cases skyrocketing despite one compliant states masking? Let's also forget correlation always mean causation - large number mitigation measures place could also contributed discrepancies. mean ""increased 100%"" misleading. went 6/100k 12/100k whereas mandated counties saw huge increase first (because they're populated) 6% decrease implementing masks. **6%.** Sure, shows difference I'm sorry convincing, solid science. making assumption based trend without controlling anything else.

Hell, might even already degree immunity conferred recent vaccinations exposures coronaviruses. hand, probably much higher risk category. Back spring even gambling vaccines, betting virus actually hurt much probably thinking herd immunity would bail long spread really fast. ideas probably came dodgy seroprevalence studies made everyone start saying IFR basically nothing. 

In end Georgia similar places got lucky whatever reason virus seem hit hard New York, UK, etc. Maybe studies eventually find causes regional differences next years. thought need full scale clinical trials tweaks lot vaccines like that. actually generally better long term immunity vaccines spread doses. water splashing, going run side get rinsed flush. high pressure stream case, water going fall straight down. Yes, quite realistic. Shipments temporarily delayed Canada, 70% Canadians still expected provided vaccine September year. Remember time previously harmless virus mutated killed 2M people worldwide?  Exactly people think schools remained open actually crazy. children get sick they’ll bring home parents heck even grand parents. Thank god schools virtual. Oh sweet summer child Someone tested positive Seattle January. Maybe regional, definitely watching locally. really getting much media March. median around 4 days though? saying durations shorter, checking heated one work? like extension cord running outlet what? I'd ask put back coma done luckily ended legit.

According Kremlin. Russia lied achievements literally first registered Covid vaccine anywhere.

That's statement made though. said ""first registered vaccine world"" There’s episode scrubs covers white well.  MIT [a really nice struggles distribute vaccines people actually need them. [They actually bunch nice articles different aspects virus vaccines, one specifically distribution difficulties.] Can't speak lot Canadians tempered expectations going vaccination season. Although Canada ordered vaccines early big portfolio local manufacturing invest R&amp;D. UK USA did. Also remove nationalism good countries need vaccines get sooner. 

I also knew takes vaccines ramp up. told quite time limited supply Q1, enough vaccinate LTCH residents, HCWs, isolated/remote communities elderly folk. expected different provinces doing. rate going slower wanted like Canada got hit EU Pfizer reductions. also know either way get 6M doses end Q1 (just later anticipated). 

Come Q2 get 20M doses Pfizer Moderna around 1M doses weekly April. start vaccinating elders risk. 

I always saw marathon knew going hiccups along way. total 40 people study. far people conclude mouthwash effective. See, thought currency post-apocalypse going bottle caps really going toilet paper. mean, think it, going bottle cap? Everybody shits though. Toilet paper super-valuable people lifetime supply going laughing they're new rich overlords paying us wages TP. There's fear, there's realistic expectations future. Top health experts said may need continue 2022. hope they're wrong, hard imagine us achieving herd immunity then. guy UK. also brain damage unable communicate. basically nothing said applies. allowed health ins.

I know, math iz hard, guiz So, problem saying basically ""if test it, believe exists."" Florida still Florida, unsafe Arizona tho cannot believe that. carrying normal lives?!??

Partially. visually numbers like use public transportation (namely train systems) quite bit.

Some companies encourage WFH, understanding experience minority companies either care simply infrastructure experience so. That's timeline one week one. We're back 250k doses week february 700k doses week march. Moving average 1M week April. person annoyed delay. shut wuhan knew real. figured China want bad press, situation/threat must pretty serious. 

Still, never thought would dragged year. thought would localized outbreaks struggled with, wide spread whogivesafuck. darkest hour. We’re past KF94/KN95 EUA/N95. standards already exist. KF94 designed this. 

We need government tell people.

1. Sorry. fired every dimwit said wear mask beginning pandemic.
2. Sorry. Mask tested standard bad idea.
3.In 90s solved problem N-95 masks. go information 90s set. can't find N-95, KF94 KN95 EUA similar. really can't figure Russia would want poison random people adversarial nations think try using head telling others use theirs. lmfao. think it’s joke. american sound say “i got covid vaccine walmart”   way mean terms workers?

In practical terms, extended unemployment benefits like we're huge swath others.

Are issues adminstering it? Absolutely.

But fail compared opening doors darkest hour pandemic downright dangerous industry barely functional normal times. are, want. in, new born baby can't comprehend pandemic! like TWD opening scene hospital. Damn, serum made good bets. Well least Russia west working together once. refreshing. good cause weren’t prioritized, bars restaurants kept open government can’t afford pay everyone CRB. Schools one worse places spreading disease. mention long term health implications children. Schools never open Wisconsin, ER 10 hours December, experience, didn’t get sick. Friend hospital week December, he’s also fine. Ok, issue dry off? never used one, idea kinda turns off. Air dry ass 10 minutes pat dry tp, stick leave gross weird tp patches? Ive never actually heard use bidet.. little stream water actually get shit off? Sounds like life Perth week. Wait third wave? thought still second. I've winning game Walmart hospitals  Science man says thing 500th time stop presses Buckle son disney 2020 January, got worse flu ever entire week. cough still gone away. covid since none family members got sick. 

I definitely got flu shot year =) saying supply won’t get sorted late April May. J&amp;J vaccine approved 2-3 weeks even slow ramp up. Also Pfizer Moderna running supply issues. There’s reason weekly avg stagnating. isn’t enough supply get 3M day months (late April earliest)
It’ll July best everyone wants vaccine get vaccine. rosy framing US continue ramp vaccinations fix administration logistics, true there’s huge supply constraint. People average intelligence right border understanding undergrad level teaching. [x] DOUBT Well it’s good thing you’re charge panning then!  Wait what? pandemic started December 19 countries it? earlier? source AstraZeenca starting shipments Q1? Everything provincal health officer MGen Fortin said receive Pfizer/Moderna doses Q1. would love proven wrong would increase vaccination rate need see source. “Oh boy im glad see friends again!”

... Yes, agreed. Right state state-wide mandate (as I'm guessing states do), lifted it'll definitely sigh relief me.

I'll likely still carry around pocket case, looking forward overly cautious it!

I'm basing absolutely nothing, hoping mask mandate lifted April. news spreading fear gets clicks, translates ad revenue.

Take everything read grain salt apply coronavirus news. everything.  Everything see news suggests able stop social distancing mask-wearing achieved full herd immunity. can't imagine happen end 2021. Read Amazon agreed confusion. think swinging pendulum way far back way this, maybe disapprove user's attitude.

Frankly, agree conclusion realistically make much distinction Russian government Russian scientific community, particularly case something like public health. government inherited predecessor complete willingness bend truth exactly matters, resources exerting tremendous pressure influence entirety country's scientific community. 

Whatever hyperbole stupidity present moment public's response present crisis, make judgements reference this, skeptically (not cynically) examine facts come rational conclusions. Maybe large American media deserves blame painting picture wholly accurate, cannot also heavily blamed increasing distrust groups give reason distrust, groups people within distrustful people's power. people come idiotic conclusions Russian vaccine point out, point trust even vetted independently think greatest responsibility result lies Russian government avowed disregard facts truth.

I previously worked minor role public health, one thing definitely state, entirely trust perception. Public health measures scientifically efficacious ideal environment. Nothing good comes scientifically sound practices designed complete ignorance way received community. difference greeted shotgun muzzle knock door welcomed people understand trying help them. want actually help people gotta leave pride door work make things better. correlation. adverse effects may even stack, many studies show way. lifelong Democrat I’m ready flayed: answer Democrats say it’s okay now.

No, public leaning towards wanting Democrats want get eviscerated 2022. Yeah seems ""a couple months"" probably safe estimate turned wrong, given like 11 months reinfections remain extremely rare true. Canada getting 256K vaccines week. Following weeks February look like (starting Feb. 18th) 70K 335K 590K. March exact weekly shipments posted based Moderna/Pfizer's contractual obligations expect see average 540K doses per week. Countries outside EU also need vaccine. Well, yes, kids started dying would whole new ballgame. there's reason speculate that. UK variant infected under-20s 15% higher rate, kids suddenly dying. accepting it? Nobody accepting it. want us do, tell virus stop? think life insurance companies screening covid issuing new life insurance policies. sure applied new health ins. Sorry, allow comments solicit donations requests money. Thank understanding!

The thing I'm afraid is, said people trying conceive probably wait studies. sub vocal number so-called lockdown skeptics. Trying point possible contingencies could prevent complete opening restrictions mid-year, get storm downvotes. Telling people cautious even vaccination, level viral transmission still high, get storm downvotes. Personally pay mind, discuss answer think. Well, listen Fauci, we're due new Super-COVID still kill us all.

Or listen Fauci simply tune out, he's point trying stay relevant. ""even"" redditors Fauci cdc saying work. 

""There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling the mask and keep touching face""

This badly stated quote Fauci. key element distinguishes people suggesting intended ""but it’s providing perfect protection people think is"". clear, said prior may block droplets **perfect** protection. statement saying work, they're saying wearing mask (alone) going anything. Unsaid quote intent context this. harkens social distance+ lockdowns. still quite true. wear mask still pack shoulder subway, mask going keep safe someone ill. number people 4 car, masked, chances much better, better even four without masks.  quote alone make clear, though lockdowns social distancing time pushed. 

This alternate timeline propose asks wrong question, suspect understand problem.  alternate timeline everyone wearing masks January, I'd hope owned 3m stock manufacturing sales existed prior that. 

The inventory mask everyone exist. Even enough masks healthcare workers EXIST, much less masks public need time highest chance exposed healthcare environment masks already found short supply.

You know that. We're yet see variants really here.

And even holiday season actually worst, things long way anything grim; places they're currently quite bit worse initial lockdowns spring.

We may see end sight vaccines, extremely foolish dangerous pretend anything couple months dangerous winter contagion still ahead enough people vaccinated unamsked indoor behavior remotely safe again. Talk silver lining. Bad news: lost year life. Good news: didn’t miss anything. (kinda)...

Is fearmongering guy gets jollies? Name one time history widespread vaccine usage pandemic somehow made pandemic even worse. Gonna go ahead assume can’t Great article. Thanks sharing 👍 😂 think LAPD. think anything results trip cell, hospital, passive. topic interests me. know learn it? Like Canada's biomanufacturing capabilities covid-19. today? summer going forward? many facilities capabilities producing vaccine? facilities produce mRNA vaccines? new Sanofi facility Quebec scheduled completed 2023 able produce mRNA? 

Like said lots questions know look. help would appreciated! :) It’s charred orange brown sugar mug, believe. Worth trying maybe? believe so, no. 

The general public likely offered vaccine July August. Prior time, many vulnerable already protection via vaccine, many public health measures likely relaxed come spring time. 

It depends personal risk level, want wait get vaccinated, waiting August may best bet. comfortable visiting friend prior, vulnerable vaccinated, go ahead. deserve it. EU categorically failed vaccinations. scrambling around red faced trying blame people UK gets *America enters chat* I'm getting vaccine still think people idiots. I'm conspiracy theorist ...

If believe reports mainstream media including Reuters, one prestigious news sources, yes conspiracy theorist. Also, population scattered equal numbers France Germany combined – manufacturing logistics well-developed. bow holy variants! Nah, still first.  tHiNk gRaNdMaS! Started towards end December. friend kept news there. started buy masks stores (CVS, Walgreens) mid-Jan, everything sold towards end Jan OOS everywhere. bought send back Hong Kong relatives since effected. pandemic.

Like get winded easily anyhow extra bad since also get muscle fatigue extra quickly now.  side tangent rapid tests guidelines effective.

Honestly funny read anal tests. think reliable, people freaking actually use them.

The rapid tests already intrusive, already anal thermometers. 

It seems like safe thing do.
On hand different test effective, let's go that. 2020 year didn’t happen, say Maybe people tired moving goalposts ever-shifting messaging. ""Two weeks flatten curve! Knock summer spike! get vaccine! even vaccine pretend work still virus! Wear two masks! Isolation!"" problem lowest, basic level analysis even finding widespread reinfection. news stories, individual stories. Nothing. There's excellent analysis reason think Manaus seroprevalence overestimated begin with, article Twitter thread explained issue 76% estimation: article mentions reinfection lineage **might** cause reinfections, nothing back up. evidence vitro escape, analysis one confirmed reinfection. rest pure speculation. Show facts, studies, true analysis. Show actual science. One life mantras ""if people think I'm reacting - probably means I'm reacting appropriately ""

Lo &amp; behold, one roommates &amp; friends (same dif) take seriously, took red flag people take seriously &amp; doubled Okay, sure point here. Reading article made aware lack knowledge area. Thank article. know like Polio flu? Britain, Israel UAE swapping gold/silver/bronze events Try antihistamine like zyrtec claritin. Sounds wild helps. live hour away hear time go, mind risk. Apparently taking insane safety precautions, tons sanitization, social distancing, mask mandate obviously, along significantly reduced park capacities (and consequently shorter lines). gone probably won't, can't say I'm tempted. doesn't. Half things hear double speak stand critical thinking. figure correct one yourself. Here's list paradoxes think top head. easily find sources mainstream publications news sites likely ones.

Wearing mask worse wearing masks masks cut transmission 95% (real number). first course lie told good.

The lockdown 3 weeks stop virus tracks definitely gone Easter (6 weeks now) magical thinking.

Masks protect others also protect unless vent despite fact vented masks used environments lethal gasses kill matter minutes.

Taking flu vaccine best thing right (March 2020) regards coronavirus (actual quote) flu vaccine nothing help.

Sing happy birthday 3 times washing hands COVID-19 airborne transmit fomites.

Herd immunity reached 60% close 50% population infected new number 90% despite new Science supporting higher number.

Kids immune virus we'll ban Twitter suggesting kids dying around us. Also schools sources transmission safe open.

Animals get COVID-19 people can't transmit humans also bats source COVID-19.

And finally vaccine stop transmission, limits symptoms taking vaccine also prevent mutations rely transmission. nothing non-factual comment. source prove it: shocking thing article. 

Am understanding correctly - caught Covid twice hospital coma? used live UK. live Europe UK passport still pay tax still. I'm starting think look vaccine trip vaccination whole Europe going happening 2021  Approval India soon production already started India informative article. Worth read. live Seattle coming home danger (in mind). company's work home announced air flying back, soon got acted like nuclear fallout everywhere outside.

The best part flight's gate next bar/restaurant thing 10 minutes boarding, started playing ""Should Stay Go"" Clash. new? thought rule long time. long would take approve moderna/Pfizer booster targets new variants? Would approval process need go steps would shorter? Well lot catch on! *The Walking Dead theme intensifies* Sounds like isekai anime story killed anyone, real murderers far right used think NPR great. Listened 2 hrs day commute. last 4 years went shit. thing read anymore general news find somewhat reliable WSJ otherwise look specialized sources. Even getting vaccinated, regular doctor appointments... important to. Stopped procrastinating health issues husband died something would easily treatable they'd caught early.

Every doctor's office I've felt safe me. Staff masked, they're spacing appointments one waiting room, etc. point, I'd reckon lot staff vaccinated. I'm back work person. sent us email said physically, act remote. ie Zoom, calls, contact, etc.

Maybe hybrid 2 scenarios 2021!?!?!?! Proofread.  Go right ahead. I'll see May so. Exactly! Hey, I'm reliant job income too! would **your choice** quit. millions people? given choice. name *safety*, people lost jobs. people reliant jobs income lost people's desire *safety* forced lawmakers enact restrictions lockdowns ruined livelihoods. agree. point help getting shot spread awareness importance getting vaccinated. mom getting vaccine right now! 1a Oregon. first person immediate life who's become vaccinated. end pandemic starting feel real... half deaths vaccinated theory. mean Russian speaking world believe BLM riot shit. Insane. Actually insane. Dont see shit like doesnt end bloodbath PA rejected Israel’s help. work college campus working remotely 10 months. 4 weeks ago called us back campus person. drive work, sit office Zoom calls, leave. lunch go walk around perimeter campus rarely come contact people.

We occasionally go store grocery shopping.

I take precautions. Mask around people. stay far away people can. store hardest since people respect space. feel like vitamin supplement game fairly dialed too.

I went doctors appointment dental appointment pandemic. waiting room empty. dentist, waited car go in.

I want get covid, know lot people did. mild symptoms recovered. symptoms mild flu recovered. cases campus.

I'm way telling do, leaving house mean get covid. getting covid mean die. lot depends situations else there.

It's basically risk management. Risk = Likelihood x Impact. percentage chance get covid leave house? would Impact did? negative media news outlets tend focus worst case scenarios skews people's judgement risk. say covid can't deadly...as certain demographics, etc. national park since started, according article masks ""encouraged"" required National Parks, even indoors Trump administration. I'm guessing parks offices putting ""wear mask"" signs etc. encourage people technically enforced now? know USPS issues actually witnessed back-and-forth local post office, employee explain customers make maskless customer put one mandate covering Federal property. 

I agree masks outdoors stupid, unless huge crowd something like that. Guys, gonna downvote me, tell I'm wrong, please. God forbid, wearing mask problem sudden people supposedly wearing year.

I feeling sub infiltrated certain type people. hope I'm wrong, though. think anti-science thing constant humanity (which frustrating), objectively worse standpoint loss-of-life Newsom said something along lines “eliminating eradicating” virus... yup, California isn’t getting time soon. ""Just stay home watch Netflix, hard 💅"" think Europeans even stupid? They’ll deny course, another nail coffin Looney-Tunes anti-vax set. Proof endangering lives flight fancy conspiracies, endangering others well. want see employers give people ultimatum, prove you’ve vaccinated GTFO. people tolerated humored far long. course wont upvoted unlike nytimes ""study"" Lol no. ever seen anti-lockdown protests Europe? 14 day averages. course move much 4 days. 1 6 “Just one life”

“This aren’t getting normal anytime soon”

“Wow hope haircut worth death you’re causing”

And time favorite: “wait 2 weeks” wait report excess mortality 2020 due mid 2021. Correct. Sleepy Biden cant keep operation warp speed pace. miss Jared Ivanka.  would hope.... Yes. That's many businesses town closed. Including favorite places go. Given results Oxford/AZ study today J&amp;J’s single jab results first doses thing focus on. 

In fact, remember threshold acceptable vaccine 50% could consider Oxford/AZ single dose vaccine. 

My guess long term we’ll find ideal gap longer 12 weeks vaccines. main (and valid) driver 3 weeks trials complete trials quickly possible jabs could start going arms. 

Pfizer aren’t saying “the vaccine won’t work” 2nd dose given 12 weeks, don’t data effectiveness schedule. still need 9 million (or less kids cant get them) vaccines. Supply limiting factor paired poor choice target demographics phase 1A 1B. one better worse anyone else, situations different.  Well subs post post already posted Friendly Reminder people worried variants: vaccines prevent hospitalizations like trials (including variants), job restrictions lifted hospitals longer risk. wanting quarantine almost month selfish, human instinct crave social interaction.   It’s quite simple really... complicated most... wear EFFECTIVE mask PROPERLY AREAS COVID LIKELY TRANSMIT. think dumb much becomes chaotic people don’t want listen I.e. “just wEaR MaSk” described decided acted government. Trump lost popular vote times. Americans didn’t want presidency. 

I still think you’re stereotyping incorrect assumptions. elon musk's kid? Hoping able go summer abroad London all! Fingers crossed! First dose nearly number ""vaccinated"" . Still good strategy balance worse, none lessons learned anti-science herd mentality top. dont think legally allowed prioritize based religion.

Why not? would private donation Jewish communities. Well, bright side second dose likely effective wait couple months.

...but yeah, US FDA hardass many countries' comparative organizations less so. seemed relevant you, said EU paid vaccines Pfizer supplied.

Also, contract seem say anything place line vaccines eu bought at, simply agrees certain delivery numbers per time period. Ive seeking DVDs (yes, best concert recordings YouTube streaming) shows decades past watching those. Good thing Covid isn’t flu. hope mutations dont cause issues start ramping vaccinations! Okay! haven’t lost taste smell yet least though Death recording great India.

It's quite possible full extent losses due covid accurately recorded next census. I’m already planning trip Spain fall things keep going well. Trying hard stay optimistic.

Why? Next: People ignore science man 500th time saying ""don't tell want mcdonald"" thought wanted reason go back bed morning! weren't? police tell move not? Well, failing obey police directive. Easy. There's probably stuff could find, that's obvious. Yea patient MRSA positive literally dont even know nurses, aides, docs bother put gowns it.

I wanted see Reddit mind cracks half cognitive dissonance. Searched coronavirus, mask-shaming Reddit people responded BLM-related protests riots. much discussion forum masks4all forum.

But plenty shaming breaking COVID protocols *other* kind protest, i.e. freedom, anti-mask protests. sure related exact thing happened wife’s family last June Michigan. FIL fell 3 months later multiple hospital stays passed away without contracting COVID. month two later MIL got covid (at Trump rally, ugh) went immediate family put hospital 2 weeks. 

As fucked is, think passing beforehand best thing happen happen - would gotten COVID wife’s stupid decisions there’s way would made that. Inception?  people ever go back normal prolonged coma? Anti-vaxers: ""You freedom want body!:

Also, enough tests time test everyone Canada needed tested, definitely enough tests open border test everyone coming through. GOOD. Don’t go breathing gross germs park ranger friends. That’s unsettling. Sounds like great plot enjoy thrillers though think obvious reason right one case... vaccine. 10% population fully vaccinated 10% could go eat restaurant without catching covid. number vaccinated rapidly grow short time. time, death rates hugh infections trending strong hope vaccine see another big wave.

You’re arguing hypotheticals lmao  I’m like tf cares super bowl? Unfortunately everyone else town 😞 Every leader CA thrown state handled COVID. Everything open Florida since summer CA strictest guidelines country one worst case wise. we’re one worst terms % vaccinated. Yes. know several people attended large indoor concerts. claim ""no singing, shouting, screaming concert, applause"". Yeah, right. require masks marginal job separation.

I respect Japanese greatly many reasons, bit much.  Pick small group start seeing them. don’t think mom right is? Better live life important people slowly fade away.  Well, one Canada currently lockdown. Non-essential travel allowed anyone.

Even case, travel Canada borders open would need quarantine ~10 days, someone could contracted COVID test positive immediately.

There good reason border Canada open nonessential travel. fact, US far ahead vaccinations would argue incentive keep border closed. Like us, missed put gamestonks  highly disagree you’re saying. We’ve already respectful wasting year lives. vast majority vulnerable populations vaccinated summer we’re going wait last human earth safe hang friends indoors. think honest reasonable take need two.doses full vaccinations . time ereguoar person nothing first line then. also counting roll quicker proven yet.

Hope best plan worst current case. short think still 50 100 million people. sure declare victory forget high risk. Still could get long term issues let's fully open old wxy safe maybe z cares z. Buying vaccines vaccines in-hand two different metrics.

My educated guess oversell idea normal Spring/Summer everyone keeps broadcasting. still vulnerable populations come time and, high measure respect, remain diligent precautions.

I fear mask free-for-all people get jabbed without considering consequences others still waiting. makes complete sense suspected, I’m expert things. wish didn’t tease apart ourselves. It’s constructive criticism scicomm public health folks. surface 2 things absolutely seem odds. told loud clear vaccinated doesn’t necessarily protect around you, needs studied. time hear “come get vaccines ASAP stop transmission”. There’s missing piece here, you’ve probably filled fairly accurately.

I think frustration general public feels highly underestimated politicians, public health, scicomm folks. supposed contradiction regard COVID-induced restrictions encountered really enraging, even it’s simply matter glossing important details.

The life people living right isn’t much life all. simple joys life seem taken away, mention major suffering induced virus economic crisis we’re dealing with. hopes getting life get dashed intentionally not, expect anger there. Oh definitely January. got insanely sick beginning year looking back covid. nursing home fatalities fault governor also fault. That's right UK schools open January... one day. anyone link sources long term effects mRNA vaccine any? keep calling new despite first discovered March. though? already know vaccine works variants. Even SA one barely different effectiveness. know getting infected confers (maybe temporary) immunity. reinfections unlikely? that's tourism

New normal crew shambles latest update. Okay, asking rationale behind decision. COVID airborne, catch breathing. need spit, air. Nurses care-takers huge vector travel patient patient. 

Many diseases spread hospitals, hard contain. mom got MRSA knee replacement surgery. work hospital don’t policy encourage patients wear masks rooms. pro mask normally don’t tell patients wear unless transported outside room.

COVID seems cause long haul symptoms much frequently viruses. Lyme disease illness think similar propensity cause chronic symptoms, obviously way fewer people get Lyme COVID. Maybe one silver lining pandemic get greater understanding chronic post-illness syndromes progress treatments.  Zero Covid cases, duh! can't take chances!! Update COVID symptoms (day-by-day). preface, tested positive Friday (1/29), symptoms began previous Tuesday (1/26). 

Day 1 (1/26): First day realized symptoms. bad headache, felt dizzy, began losing taste smell, bad nasal congestion, low-grade fever, upset stomach. 

Days 2 &amp; 3: Nasal congestion, smell taste nearly gone, still upset stomach. 

Day 4: Tested positive. Smell taste gone. Upset stomach. Sore throat. 

Days 5 &amp; 6: dealing lack taste smell sore throat. 

Day 7: Began worrying blood oxygen saturation BPM, realized overreacting. Taste smell began slightly come back. Sore throat still there, healing up. 

Day 8 (yesterday): Quite possibly weirdest day thus far. Smell taste went 65%-85% back I'd say, win. Sore throat still there, still feels healing. felt strange feeling day. sure psyching what, felt odd. Around 7:00pm, started odd feeling left armpit, like slight pinch. figured muscle something; something related COVID. around 8:30-9:00, could feel heart beating rapidly. really bad anxiety, I'm sure also played factor. resting heart rate pushing 101-105, anywhere range. felt body pulsating, freaking out. went bed, turned soft music, 101 resting heart rate dropped low-70s I've felt fine ever since. 

So, brings couple questions (if made far) 

1. read body trying fight virus, usual resting heart rate go up. normal around mid-70s-mid-80s, bounced 100-105, freaking out, probably caused anxiety raise bit more. y'all tested positive dealt increase heart rate? checked blood sugar oxygen saturation (both great numbers), know COVID causing heart rate go up, anxiety general. 
2. far taste smell concerned, know yet people lose them/how long takes get back? read articles saying people usually get senses back 3-4 weeks, longer. I'm getting mine back roughly week later. thing happened mom sister. lost within week, back. based genes? Hmm actually want missed past 11 months. mean yeah sucked definitely unique. like one thing whole world experienced time everyone older like 4 remember fof quite while. I'm sure 2020/the pandemic referenced memed years.  Sure, completely irrelevant discussion. rare hospital setting, presuming hospital duration coma. enough time immunity fade studied, opportunities exposure hospital staff someone asthma I'd like avoid getting flu hospitalized asthma attack. Thnx. So, 10% population US? That's actually pretty good! Francophobia, say! 
Actually, take husband seriously crowed wonderful Japan. year (and TP shortage), sold, baby! Wtf talking about? Every time Re*ublican gets it, they're constantly shamed like fault. Colour red release atmosphere hot air balloons. I’d rather read headline: Student wakes 11-month coma knowledge COVID pandemic. Lol Japan we're literally going lives. Many people care, many people to. I'm teacher, school open, teach. also considered 'close contact' infected person maskless, test close someone wearing mask. mean might wear mask winter sometimes I’m going really crowded location 

But it’s highly unlikely we’ll need everything need really widespread successful vaccination campaign.

Merkel saying probably yearly bi-yearly type thing like flu vaccine there’s new vaccine formulated get counter variants. That’s something many experts saying occur even early vaccine development, won’t effect restrictions/masks point every one would already initially inoculated Walmart laid plan vaccine distribution December.

Everyone knew they'd getting next round availability.

But yeah, sure, white house media calling Biden's plan.... 

CVS Walgreens also list. make happen office too? 

Definitely biggest pharmacies. took presidential action, obviously!! could even imagine genius idea pharmacies administer vaccines?!! 

I mean, already distribute shots. beyond anyone's wildest dreams manage covid shots. 

Do understand distribution works? Manufacturers pumping vaccines quickly possible point inventory becomes available.

But yeah, go ahead enjoy PR campaign patting people back things already motion. grandfather vacinated today Oxford/AstraZeneca. long imune response kicks in? links info? looked find lifelong Democrat I’m ready flayed: answer Democrats say it’s okay now. Thanks gold. Appreciate ❤️ that's china, US canadas biggest trading partner. They’re making spectacle it. Neither CTU City operating good faith even rationally. So, know what? it. It’s kids’ district won’t either, go it. look articles like neither - make note facts (if any) move on? Meanwhile, keep fucking around Canada claiming they'll still hold contractual obligations. timeline seems less less plausible.

Enjoy ending pandemic USA, guys really deserve really buckling whole time Yeah, seem getting less expected whatever reason. Sigh. I'm happy US though. That's always kind world works. rich countries always get better access medical treatments whatnot etc. 

But import note rich countries yes they've ordered far vaccines needed like intentionally this. vaccines we're ordered last year anyone really knew vaccines we're going make ones would come first. many rich countries like Canada etc placed orderd various vaccines incase fsiled incase one vaccine comes others way left out. 

For example Canada placed fairly substantial order sanofi. say Canada purchased Sanofi last year would screwed since delayed lile 5 vaccines now. example placed bets J&amp;J would delayed since J&amp;J came data compared pfizer came data back November. reality got extremely lucky like 5 successful vaccines I'm sure many countries probably hoped atleast one makes it. 

But there's good news poorer countries. Russias sputnik vaccine found 91% effective western nations unlikely purchase likely used poorer countries then. basically whatever necessary sustain epidemic. Got it. understand answer often ""almost certainly yes/no, say yet waiting data confirming it"". time start using Dakotas example rest country look like approach herd immunity. maybe 50% state infected they're also great vaccinations. new cases gradually slowing smaller smaller trickle approach zero. 

the thing happen rest US. herd immunity kill switch cutoff point. accurate analogy would faucet. likewise, ""returning back normal"" like faucet stream gets bigger bigger. jolt electricity grand announcement. especially consider psychological effects this. think addressing like turning hot water back on.

Permanent damage mild cases common all. Sorry hear that. hope feel better soon. Oh jeesh Ive geographic tongue years. diagnosed covid? Remember lack national strategy exactly response bad. 

Not anymore. :) Based age, 4-7. said true, doubt you, whoever charge shit country facing criminal charges diabolical. OG strain estimated R0 5.7, CDC calculating R0 based restrictions mask usage (and scare people. Look science journal corroborate claim. 

The new number 8.55 50% virulence. 5.7 * 0.5 = 2. 85 + 5.7 = 8.55 makes sense broader discussion, think question meant response previous commentors explanation line cooks higher average infection rate they're immigrants, due living working conditions. several companies capable production vaccines? allowing Pfizer exclusive right production Patent Law - even emergency citizens dying thousands. Even government gave Billions BARDA development.  much could have?
Biden parsed words carefully - Defense Production Act implemented solely precursors PPE vaccines. 66% positive tests. No-one vaccinated group hospitalised. talking mostly fringe shut-ins social anxiety disorders. them, masks greatest thing since GTA V (or VI, whatever hell we're on). 

Have upvote. Remember lack national strategy exactly response bad. States independently discovering usefulness partnerships seeing West Virginia blow everyone else water going small local.

This strongly recommended states still this, even simply coordinated federal distribution level instead dumping much burden states. Jesus christ that's morbid.

And fascinating. read article, Merkel speaking behalf EU, Germany. says vaccine welcome EU passes EU scientific scrutiny. bureaucrats covering asses, case, gonna cost lot old people lives.

There compelling reason believe vaccine much less efficacious elderly. no, deliberately misconstrued absence evidence evidence absence feel safer way. likely would type SARS, like one SARS 2 electric boogaloo. effects transmission still studied. Obviously, cautious treating like fact evidence either way isn’t productive either. Also, telling people STILL can’t see family members everyone involved vaccinated turn people taking vaccine won’t see point.   worry hope end tunnel.. don’t explode changes downswing steep shallow plateau?  will. pandemic receding. 


Now need kee plants staffed powered future use challenging part. Please stick arm. I’ll even take exotic Russian import. I’ll rate 10/10 clarity, taste, aroma, even give fever. Heck, I’ll order entire case share friends! thought strategies get stragglers get jab.

Say September 2021, million people left vaccinate. gave $1 tax break getting vaccine 2021 taxes, would impact all?

I'm thinking overlap people fight get back every dollar government people may fence vaccine. convince antivaxxers, that's sure. want seem like paying people get vaccine. Whatever strategy use, needs symbolic cheap. Russian vaccine fill crucial spot global market. It’s affordable forgiving cold chain. developing countries world definitely gravitate Sputnik V one China’s vaccines.

The poorest countries get donations middle income countries pay. ""Nah, guys fucking me! Shelter place? Wear masks? Wash hands every 10 minutes? Hahaha"" RNs getting live 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Best luck. can’t wait it’s turn. Someone would tell him. walking dead he's waking abandoned hospital, there's people tell him. surprised special therapists people unexpectedly went coma explain happened.

This video game people would randomly start talking death rate around guy got coma simultaneously explain they're talking asked. limited number vaccine doses available. Giving one country another nothing delay anything. 
The line moving fast, people getting vaccinated fast. US gave vaccines Burkina Faso, Burkina Faso would indeed fewer cases variants, US would cases variants.

Now, rich countries start flushing vaccines drain countries suffer, becomes different story. really damn far away that. partly due doctor's saying media pumping oblivion. get scientific approach, lot people see sign vaccine tested properly. 

My usual explanation people says scientists can't tell you, sure, sun rise tomorrow morning. past experience says will. US explodes cases near future (lets say next 4-6 weeks) would convince me. see unlikely though they've declining coming 3 months. I'm highly skeptical 30-50% figure. states give local independent pharmacy. Feds going able effects identify those! three, then? lot also difference distributed delivered. state twisted hour many they've received, usually ~50k less government says they've distributed. used vaccine less week get big delivery. got more, could vaccinate more. Russia facilities mass produce vaccines. likely one never widely used. Texas,
Why? county California gotten new vaccine supply week reason know coming. County 4 locations set vaccinate 7 days week shots give. Saving economy also important, covid almost done anyway Lol, Germany purchased vaccines side. fuck Hungary blocking purchase mRNA vaccines.  right beside getting shot, ""mild cold"" 38% people develop contagious. 

Is true?

I thought viral load affected contagious person was. less sick, produce lower viral load leading reduced contagiousness? Plus, asthma longer risk factor COVID risk factor long time.

? that's case, pandemic never over. limit everyone getting different manufactured vaccine, assume ability see short/long term results? interesting see results x months/years Georgia Texas? that's family. Parents 60+, 2 siblings 30+. I'm 20s (youngest)

How asthma health risk? Never heard before. it. post removed poor quality begin comments worse.  also agreement produce AstraZeneca's along Mexico? believe lot things, part comment definitely lol. Hopefully shots delayed numbers pop back later week.  EU 100% nationalistic. point going put good Friday agreement danger reckless acts blocking vaccines Northern Ireland, stopped managed quite accomplishment getting British Irish governments, parties Northern Ireland come heavily them. 

The EU never relying UK vaccines point, UK production vaccines start pandemic. would OK say point, ok EU make vaccines EU, making threats cut supply allowing companies sell vaccine slots UK, Canada, Australia others really on.

Also UK plants production problems, supposed get 10s millions doses last year, signed deals months earlier able sort out. EU could done messed much. Lol COVID-19 brain like toxoplasmosis cats. Yes know, I’m California, governor team year plan didn’t shit. California joke. remember people media get paid based much attention get. March 2020 maybe voice reason got lot attention. February 2021 voice doom gets attention. Facts, truth, mental health, etc. matter he's trying get paid. like certain attention whores culture. Interesting. thought would common. think good news going forward then? new strains worry you? also UK parliament works BTW. Thats good, russia outsource production?  dont know vaccinations new cases nearly cut half peak 3 weeks ago. Deaths havent bad either. starting days 100+ deaths.  guess annual flu shot often 40-50% effective roll every year still well worth based number lives saved people spared days illness, even 60% J&amp;J would normally considered fine, it’s there’s already two players 90%. He's epidemiologist. He's physician immunologist. credentials, could easily...easily make $4 million year private sector. could walk door Merck tomorrow they'd make executive vice president executive president division. former head CDC (Julie Gerberding) become division president ~$2.5 million executive vice president total compensation around ~$7-8 million per year. Fauci much bigger name Gerberding. I’ll refer original comment may take... lot dying. Better p100 mask, 100% effective vs 95% effective people assuming vaccines effective variant? evidence plenty evidence least partially effective, likely enough stop spread. Bayesian analysis works. stats, usually look 95% chance ""significant"". corresponds legalese would described ""beyond reasonable doubt"", though still easily susceptible p-hacking.

The problem Bayesian analysis pick priors. that, actual work pretty easy. want choose outcome little enough data, easily pick prior gives want want.

It might interesting larger scale creating survey priors, applying Bayesian reasoning top it. conspiracy theorists pick priors obviously...is going convince anyone looks closely. yep. every cough: ""ro....na"" Traumatic brain injury cause amnesia weeks months prior incident, especially long coma. apply food bitte. “We’ll maybe arrest next time?” supposed good enough? Dodger Stadium operation temporarily shut down. I’m fan LAPD, even exist? Move glasses , fixed problem. balance comments sub elsewhere, I'm starting suspect encourages behaviour spread virus - bit like zombie caterpillars, ants fungus. still can't believe every country world agrees something, anything. ever happened history? I'd imagine percentage distributed doses used climb rapidly. number doses continue go up, presumably number doses produced get used somewhat stable (i.e. many doses sitting unused storage given time). Right 33mil doses administered U.S., means 17mil produced yet used. time are, say, 250mil doses produced, even stock unused doses half big 25mil, that's still 90% administered. get better distributing them, fewer restrictions eligible/targeted population, could see areas keeping supply essentially depleted, basically giving shots soon come in. CDC went masks ineffective cloth masks double cloth masks. stop. article front saw preliminary research finding UK variant caused higher virion production nose. respiration infected people lot virus particles. Depending state infection curve, may need rethink one countermeasures. Like said, 6 ft distance might increased. people could wear better masks (some areas Europe requiring N95 equivalents FFP2, public, rather simply cloth masks -- probably already. KN95, KF94, FFP2, N95 masks ). know widely reported. estimates 30% population exposed. probably higher certain areas especially outbreaks recently.

It's like chain letters Ponzi schemes, exponential growth eventually run people. can't huge exponential outbreak without also exposing huge part population virus thus making immune verifying immunity. doubt it, don’t think it’s possible fully lose immunity vaccines distributed lot widely. I've watching states numbers seems there's delays ""allocated"", ""shipped"", ""administered"". vax hubs saying enough meet demand still. Probably likely really transmissible huge extant reason another become dominate. Maybe creates higher viral load place superspreader event seeded better. NBA operating inside bubble anymore. bubble used resume last season postponed due covid. travel now, article completely utterly irrelevant.

If you’d done research correctly, you’d looking articles like this: true. watch US news channel, make clear disappointed AZ trial AZ vaccine nowhere near effective Pfizer/Moderna/Novavax ones despite US ordering lot AZ’s. purely political comment mods ? 7-day average cases US lowest since November 14

That 7-day average bad back November, simply getting back November levels cause rejoicing. I'm saying doom gloom time, beat Covid yet. 

I also disagree mainstream media exclusively full bad news, sub tends fixate ones are. Stop posting fake nonsense clickbate. easy misunderstand.  usual pattern zoonotic viruses become less deadly infectious new species.  However, people say neglect mention time scales involved fact general tendency, hard fast trade-off. reduce severe illness, would fine. Drastically cut death rate severity lot manageable virus 99.5% survival rate existential threat? hyperbole ridiculous. It’s barely deadly enough implementing kind restrictions. Nobody going put forever. I'm sceptical anything leads ""beyond reasonable doubt."" caused “open schools NOW!” panic sudden around country? It’s odd time year, especially vaccines still ramping up?

Dunno supporting staff traveling countries, though, assume many. question hand government honesty. governments “West” far transparent less corrupt autocracies like Russia. 

That doesn’t make perfect. it’s also terrible take suggest US countries “West” net negatives world, despite checkered pasts colonialism, slavery, yes, election interference. lives people around world dramatically improved economic engine “west.”

People love shit America Reddit, incredibly positive force world aggregate. think read somewhere bulk long term care residents vaccinated 1/25/2021, would guess we're two weeks away seeing noticeable drop.

I've also noticed low hospitalization drop Mondays Tuesdays whereas Sundays Mondays low days cases deaths. I'm curious there's difference. Thanks clarification. wish change messaging back “don’t overwhelm hospitals, “One life lost many”. latter seems like excuse indefinite restrictions, regardless non-public health consequences, labeling anyone disagrees selfish. 

Fauci saying since May virus isn’t getting eradicated. can’t save everybody get risk level zero, even kept guidelines years decent compliance. also people absolute obsessing 5-10% differences efficacy % idiots, frankly. media really constantly reporting scientific stats context, general public obviously understand use for, leads silly assumptions.

/s I’m 91.6% sure Russian lie stole secret sauce J&amp;J. saying shit back May. Don’t get wrong, take seriously, drowning every voice experts fields taking scientific approach way. Alcohol one drugs kill quit fast. ween alcohol medical supervision run great risk death. 

This alcohol ungodly dangerous. could literally heroin addict went cold turkey you’d fine. wouldn’t fun. heroin withdrawal doesn’t kill. Alcohol withdrawal does. Yeah, lots streets squares named WWII. looks like rna vaccines rock. higher efficacy compared ones, Pfizer one strongest (or least data says it’s strongest), showing really good results blocking severe covid I’m pro taking anything that’s available :) wanna say EU citizen also happy mazdercz leading EU. fullhearthily approve EU checking exports now, reason lead Canada going without hope deliveries keep arriving planned should. deleted bc emotions it, basically always knew vaccines would decrease transmission lot virtue suppressing symptoms felt like goalpost pushing bit key word ""almost"".

So survive infection, long hauler, really living? commentator's comment really erodes trust process. data already mentioned MHRA announces approval decision along delayed dosage recommendation.

One panelists conference constantly referred existence data want mention much would breach peer-review process. Even letter recommendation mentioned data marked unpublished.

The person seems think data available peer-review process, considering scientists involved regulatory bodies equally qualified review data. 

I hope understand various scientific process bit commenting buy hey, Reddit guess. Gagging Penis party? One free 😂😂😂👌👌👌 
Nice one mate. 25-35% americans already infected. lop good 25% chunk Fauci's estimate get good estimate transition back normality start r/covid19 decent info stickies  Irrelevant people dying you?

For conventional medicine would agree unprecedented pandemic options (right now) clearly wrong choice least harm approach taken. Oh fuck died?? heard states! help manufacturing already approved ones lol government could directly given subsidies businesses keep afloat safe, noooooo.

No free lunch. Everyone could get sick die happens. way causes less inflation, something. Stopped rising ? Yeah sure. Learn read charts. thought decrease cases vaccines lockdowns. don’t know details you’re grandma I’m sorry hear loss. likely didn’t die caught pneumonia hospital. likely caught pneumonia sedentary bed falling. It’s quite common unfortunately elderly, fall, bed extended periods time laying flat like isn’t good ones lungs. causes atelactisis fancy term alveoli collapsing lungs expanding fully. This, turn lead things pneumonia. Source :Er Nurse it’s almost like slept whole pandemic.

That's exactly happened. that? understand policy enforce individual campers outside? nuance? end El Dorado... LAPD pathetically stupid incompetent people known universe.

Also probably busy beating shit wives small children. government paid people take long trip vacations more. That’s did. least miss much fun. would pretty weird find essentially sleeping since different President office though. According airborne transmission calculator, around 3 hours closed classroom, looks like there's 70% chance least one person gets infected assuming least one student carries infection, students wearing standard masks.

You play around ton variables calculator,  Huh, ninja editing suppose...? Wow, like ""Wake-Up"" Lincoln Project commercial.   Potentially good news source  Yeah classrooms also socially distanced (I mean Japan socially distancing), students sat right top obviously maskless lunch PE. I’m sure you’re saying exactly, can’t want every country get vaccinated quickly possible? seems like want entire country 40 million people vaccines “punished” way mutually closing border middle global pandemic.    Honestly, reading case, covid gonna least problems.

""Waking up"" 11 month brain injury induced coma like waking good night's sleep.

Upset? trying explain basic supply demand you.

What exactly win? noticed proclaimed winner exactly contest. TIL. always thought every European country form public health care system Reinfections rare - run 2% within 3 months. 
And doesn’t matter long antibodies show - virus mutates lower antibody binding. 
Why think influenza goes around around? 
Immune evasion. Labelling science don’t like ‘gloom’ useful.

Tokyo different--it easier, everyone bubble vaccinated addition isolated tested. desired, quarantined either end trip cared quarantine hotel workers also vaccinated tested regularly.

This first big test whether country willing go back normal post-vaccination try maintain Covid shutdowns forever. government refuses send athletes 2021 Olympics, watch may next. America sequencing something like 0.03% infections--we WAY developed countries genomic surveillance. start looking new homegrown variants though almost immediately found them, like:

\- LA: Columbus: almost certainly variants going around even know yet. Biden accomplish 2 weeks? vaccines work nevertheless? gay male gingers plague masks. vaccine, results back  guys pure cringe. “tHaT wAsNt ReAl LOcKdOwN”.  Cringe. Classroomst's  gonna go wide? Go take reasonable precautions masking, distancing avoiding indoor, unventilated areas  Nice try... Well kind knew pretended it’s really happening  Man, CNN really trying keep fear amidst good news. Vow more.  problem guaranteeing people show up.

Either schedule, inviting people doses (which inconvenient possibly increase exposure risks sending home empty handed) schedule correct amount scramble manage shows.

Having list possible recipients leftover doses change fact people may also show.

In truth happening exactly /u/Awanderingleaf explained. determined extra doses available, providers reaching people high risk know available (they live close by, family member home drive them, appointment otherwise, etc.)

My wife works clinic going let dose go waste. Brits finally stop bullshitting variant originate UK. Who's laughing genocide?

I'm laughing you, lol actually *read* that? LOL. believe shat vaccine September got approved “too early”. results 5 months later. 

Risky move, appears worked OK near hiking trails take drive go walk, gonna catch covid worst case 3 second walk another hiker difference safe neurotic. mean sound mean seriously, behavior really unhealthy think need start pushing get more, especially nearing normalcy again. I'm saying go lick every surface see, go grocery store, go long walk, drive next town over, go hang park somewhere. reinforce behavior safe within head, harder snap it, even post-vaccination.

Again, doctor psychologist, two cents want people needlessly suffer health anxiety. says Russia WHO/Europe COVID nervous system virus, intellectually disabled nothing COVID. Plus, asthma longer risk factor COVID risk factor long time.

For fat people, don’t wanna fat shaming, gotta lose weight going diet exercising free time.  Sorry, attention

waned. think doom media excessive.

But think say certainty point B117 variant definitely transmissible provide upward pressure transmission rates near future.

I think countries strong vaccination programs like US good chance counteract upward pressure, slow would otherwise even faster recovery.

Hi neighbor, thats whats happening Macedonia right now. We'll live Corona, government wasnt capable getting vaccines relied COVAX. (they're apparently talks Russia Chinese) good thing January February really treating us well max temperature today 14° COVID cases seem going down. We're apparently getting 5k doses Pfizer one month I'm ""lucky"" I'm part ""front line"" medical personnel I'll probably get first shot February March. There's still hope lot anti vaxxers anti west people even wanna hear pfizer Chinese vaccines want Sputnik V including colleagues easily fall propaganda. 8 months in. since got it. debilitating 20. extremely depressed. If/when vaccines fail hit herd immunity via infection. Look North &amp; South Dekota Covid19 charts. places effectively hit herd immunity via infection. point (after hitting herd immunity) virus essentially become slow burn society. Cross immunity &amp; memory B &amp; cells slowly reduce virulence virus time becomes endemic society. 

I think USA &amp; alot Europe hit herd immunity May/June. least reach point virus causing enough deaths/hospitalizations justify lockdowns. Life go back less pre-Covid.  

As side note: New-Zealand &amp; idea going do. lockdown vaccine approach &amp; fails know move forward? also seems like vaccine campaign worldwide going worse US experienced  Literally look would take Russian Vaccine. plenty options. (Not like i'd even option taking Russian vaccine) listen Fauci. hear him, we're still going die mutant Super-COVID. virus estimated least R0 8.55

where get estimate from?  That's like saying flooded ship listing 10 degrees starboard instead 15, let's turn half water pumps. Я уверен, что это объяснение задним числом придумали.

Ну и создатель сам об этом сказал об английском слове, что не отменяет существование заимствованного русского.    Meh, I’m interested whether people change mind presented evidence. perfect message right bat, especially rapidly evolving situation unfair bar clear. actually respect people change tune, people cling ideas sake notion “purity” ego. dont know enough unfortunately long covid. seems likely vaccines impact long covid significantly reduce symptom severity. obviously data long time. 

The Oxford vaccine also reduces spread obviously reduce numbers people developing long covid. 

In truth though. cat bag covid stay. return normality point. risk death covid eliminated seems good place start.

Maybe they're first name basis thought formal public? **'Viruses cannot mutate replicate'** 

Fauci = NY killed almost pattern data based lockdowns see. guess know 100% years people freely study it. again!

WHAT? issue NOW? say something wrong??? 

I even said intranasal vaccine greater efficacy. person iniatally attempted correct notion sterilizing immunity reason. talked intramuscular vaccines able confer kind immunity SARS-CoV-2 LITERALLY measure succesful vaccines respect AstraZeneca's vaccine actually inducing sterilizing immunity % participants. 

Was wrong *there*? case none covid vaccines induce kind immunity % participants? 
Also, could chime infection starts there's consensus?

I assume think I'm wrong questions since unpleasently surprised discussion topic well. 26 million confirmed cases, variants variants variants now. doesn’t sound scary South African Brazilian variant think restaurant owners sued Cuomo shits giggles? good? world won’t even made dent vaccinations then. No, I’m saying would downvote simply existing lol. 

What I’m saying think would probably (based posts I’ve seen) disagree navigate society stage pandemic, particularly discovery new variants. You’ve spent good chunk life field Biology, I’ve spend good chunk mine applying mathematics statistics quantitatively assess risk - don’t know we’re honestly various risks past. 

So, said appreciate bringing honest facts changes added dangers variants. think it’s unfortunate people blindly downvote it’s negative news. wouldn’t downvote simply that. 

But would assume don’t think there’s point additional risk outweighed quality life metrics. do, think there’s point time aggregate losses metrics worth added risk introduced virus.... look forward downvoting *opinion* future discussions (assuming assumption stance correct). Lmao. Literally million people vaccinated.  list, really see ""we took seriously states"" ""Anti-lockdown"" states dispersed kind pattern.. highly *prevalent* UK!  Gotta put oxygen mask first Lockdowns work. worked China, Vietnam, Israel, UK, France, NZ right Portugal. like flipping switch, exponential goes reverse.

However, longer leave it, harder longer - open Covid control, get again.

None controversial understood. problem personally lose lockdowns understandably keen. However benefit society whole clear. I’m Canada feeling mad everybody’s squabbles, frankly. may colony once, it’s like UK sending us vaccines; aren’t involved all, caught crossfire. sure would like get things paid for. key word here. among first 10-20% population get shot, whether able transmit extent important thing know. Packed churches Easter! mean it’s surprising. Covid restrictions mediocre job stopping spread covid it’s infectious much less infectious flu spread well covid restrictions.

Fauci dead wrong.

This time last year completely underestimated virus, told us fly masks good. means virus probably LONG March, right? mean, yeah. national guard really shipping stuff much. caveat would say dangerous leave Covid19 circulating around, new variants may arise, specifically ones spread easily vaccines work on. 

The U.K. variant also becoming dominant strain could lead another spike.

So definitely agree sentiment easing restrictions, especially death toll continues decline. God knows tired shit. really need speed vaccination rate order reach herd immunity earlier date. context hypothetical actual situation, situation it’s brainer approve vaccine done weeks ago. think Wuhan still interesting.

I personally believe numbers dead early 10x higher officially reported, estimate what, 30-40,000 dead Hubei Sichuan early on... controlled end.

Its interesting little information time, delayed making decision, put place massive lock Spring Festival things got completely hand...

I sympathy slow action, given new virus, little sympathy hazy numbers (reports Wuhan early Jan funeral homes crazy). 

It also showed hard lockdowns work. Yes **Wrong.**

The original two targets Russian nationals, two UK citizens died police officer hospitalized. One best friends getting second dose today grandma getting first today! Two people see soon! :) worry, me, probably say 'better things possible!!!' type phone charged using power running house schmuck generate factory, eat food picked processed field worker. catch coronavirus last christmas ever, good choice Yo completely forgot Tiger King released last year. Feel like I’ve aged 20 years time chances vaccine-escaping mutation increase virus still spreading large numbers among unvaccinated people. we'd pretty much back square one happened. 

We need ramp vaccination also suppressing spread much possible meantime. Yes, Spike frothing mouth currently Gizmo’s reluctant stay goddamn drawer Gremlins 2 certainly show  I’m sure forgot mention UK citizens right? That’s big difference moms getting vaccine tomorrow! needed something fresh scare Well easy buy doses half population once. would like US taking delivery 150 million doses once. know still bit aways, makes feel bit better. Thankful smart Oxford peeps. honestly wish Gov't would across board. 100$ check (or more) anyone gets doses. know medical ethics it, extraordinary times call extraordinary measures. let companies offer vaccination bonuses write money taxes, etc.  y'all tested positive dealt increase heart rate?

Yes, mine randomly increased pulse oximeter monitor helpful see what's normal (sounds like already)

About month diagnosis, wife heart rate 200s go hospital; think myocarditis unfortunately limited amount testing could figure out. seem like immediate risk concerned, something keep eye on. numbers wrong comes deaths, read that. Huh, look back? People baffled right now. takeaway little efficacy vaccine, everything efficacy PCR tests. 

PCR tests circumstances used primary diagnostic test. 

And yet... are. many vaccines don’t provide sterilizing immunity (rotavirus, pertussis, polio). hope expectation absolutely always covid vaccine would provide least partial immunity infection means given.  win, regardless frame according data published Lancet phase 3 trials, Kremlin.

You clearly read study. Lancet published data, contributed Russians, **literally funded Russian Government.**

""Funding
Moscow City Health Department, Russian Direct Investment Fund, Sberbank, RUSAL.""

Link actual numbers going basically same.

Plenty folks already infected recieving vaccine. There's basically push even wait end line, aside anaphylaxis concerns waiting 90 days infection, people right line everyone else. 

We get bonus points vaccinate, infected, really enough move needle. Taking second Pfizer dose hours. Took days work due majority hospital saying got wrecked second shot, however, lasted day two. know you’re getting downvoted, kinda agree you. got pregnant February 2020 weren’t cases US. waiting pregnancy test early March 2020 said husband negative, we’d pause trying conceive. Shit starting get real. went thru entire pregnancy pandemic. added lot stress family. could list stressors losses pregnant pandemic, anyway, guess I’m say see point. wouldn’t wish pregnancy experience anyone. 

I think it’s personal choice tho. lot friends willfully got pregnant pandemic. It’s odd me, choices. They’re happy choices it’s judge. happy IVF continue years trying months covid delays. That’s because, exceptions, mutations occurred early 2020 effect virus’ behavior herd immunity. Life expectancy india 10 years younger developed west. many old people get sick/die portion population. Around 45th parallel thanks.
If vaccinated every Canadian September I'll hump beaver. feel safe JNJ vaccine - get it, live life! 

You control decisions this. can't control anyone else decides. 

The trade weeks faster vs robust protection something everyone going agree on. Yeah. work hospital plenty coworkers refused vaccine. Take details deny family vaccine loathe. kill random civilians give whole NATO justification invade cut Putin’s head off.

They've literally already done nato nothing. Multiple people poisoned Novichok UK NATO shit. Try keep here. Yep exactly. one effective vaccines ever developed hear might work work.

The vaccine works already shown amazing progress continue so. knew covid end Jan know pandemic march exactly. sleep year, 2020 probably best year. hospital? even know confirmed cases anyone getting twice. They're actually testing different separations - friends trial.   hospital? :(  US 8.2% one shot 1.9% fully vaccinated. Canada 1.6% 0.3%. It'll probably get even apart throughout February, maybe even double amount Americans ***fully*** vaccinated Canadians gotten one shot. Starting March Canada might make ground, even close right now.   ""Vaccines stop transmission"" starting feel like spring's version ""medical-grade masks protective healthcare workers stop general public getting virus."" repeated much science behind known sound they're trying drive specific behaviors general public (this spring: continuing universal mask-wearing social distancing, last spring: keeping people buying stockpiles PPE). truth complicated falls somewhere ""vaccines completely protective spreading"" ""vaccines nothing stop transmission."" current vaccines help prevent mers? exactly world living in... That’s really vaccine reports read. It’s much complicated air probably got ceiling places people typically touch. anti-vax. anti-vax crowd likes take high ground object mandates attempts keep message social media. 

So idiots protesting trying prevent someone else getting vaccine. special breed douchebaggery. Interesting people ""Muh Freeedumb"" issue wearing mask denying peoples freedom choice get vaccine. gained sweet ponytail  Same! admit dead would big blow vaccine companies media want believe vaccines totally safe never kill anyone.

Sheer nonsense, millions vaccinations well possible people die it. idea vaccine companies media present ""make believe"" story yet another absurd conspiracy theory.

They cannot.  could gotten air. surfaces, lasts days amounts enough infect, there's way distinguishing someone getting air day before. Honestly feel like hope US finish vaccinating get output. Same. I’m glad kids safe I’m glad don’t really get hit hard Corona but.....please scoot back excitedly telling hawks That's reddit point  Well another neighbor. I'm actually aware Mexico's vaccination situation I'm guessing ahead Canada. Still though, ought plenty both. Imagine falling coma right pandemic hit, waking month two ended far many people acting like children complete honesty viable option. We're able read lines get idea recommendations coming like government trying deceive, holy crap many irresponsible morons everywhere. Sinopharm higher 79% ish Sinovac 50 percent healthcare workers sample. 80 percent general population, 100% effective severe symptoms. long time coming. There’s new thing called breathing. It’s probably lot covid patients caught covid. know. Breathing isolating home. stay fuck home possible even there’s mask mandate. Definitely agree, think would question/be concerned amount PPE doctors though? Wonder people act like sinopharm version exist using common sense?

The idea prove alive satisfy people claim dead simply absurd.

What's next? parents lost child school shooting come live TV lie-detector test? thought had. time March came around, swept China. Spread Singapore Japan. People hoarding toilet paper. summer olympics talking postponement. Italy's hospitals getting overwhelmed. Spain starting get bad. pretty hard miss guess kids read news much Canadian don’t hold country decides need take care people vaccines produce exporting. Especially considering cases per million higher. would expect Canada same. Put mask assist others. don't, see surfaces check surfaces traces virus, use determine whether people got infected fomites aerosols. E.g. find traces ceiling surfaces room, aerosols. one surface, fomites. That's saying. Purely considering USA's best interests see leftovers could go anywhere else outside letting producers back auction highest bidder Back normal, stage 1: unmasked virtually everywhere except maybe mass transit healthcare settings, hanging friends stuff we'd pre-pandemic (eating restaurant together, going movies, etc)

Back normal, stage 2: unrestricted international travel, cruise ships running pre-pandemic capacity levels, tourism back full-force need reassurance: UK sequenced 34,000 samples variant E484K showing less 100 Awesome, thanks! Subscribed. think smartest decision? No,

Yeah, imagine finding people died last year? one go?? 28 Days Later vibes even news, sub massive hard-on mRNA vaccines 90%+ efficacy numbers without even understanding trial data efficacy comparable across time periods pre post-new strains, even though prevent hospitalizations, deaths (almost certainly) transmission high degree. good reason think/hope (most vaccines do, symptomatic coughing clearly spreads virus, etc.) Phase 3 trials prove vaccines safe effective preventing disease measure transmission specifically.

We could probably imagine way transmission reduced. Like know asymptomatic transmission factor COVID, Phase 3 trials measure asymptomatic cases. maybe asymptomatic spread increases among vaccinated somehow. I'd guess pretty unlikely. Ah, makes numbers lot less impressive Rage virus hit America would never movie 28 days later half fucking country would say hoax.

Seriously? That's actually insane government step either pay take covid patients force order save lives.

In Ireland reached deal private hospitals part fighting pandemic. Shame every country cannot same. data articles published coronavirus even [And people bought us vaccines first  would wait trial data come vaccines.

I’m saying it’s going safe, there’s process. Right? interesting might consequences blocking people getting healthcare, also affects men. mean dead. Exactly situation Ireland schools open last December (closed thanks unions keeping teachers safe).

If child covid, students would considered close contacts, teachers staff, vice versa. artificially trying reduce reported cases actively enforced blackouts silenced students teachers schools outbreaks, forcing stay open fear public panic.

At least strong teacher unions called bs keeping students teachers safe (though education severely impacted). type mask wearing called ""dick nose"" Holy shit dude, basically got down. exactly partition periods time since pandemic started.

Plus routes well. LOT vaccine candidates going trials, even within rough 'category' mechanisms involved actually sometimes meaningfully different. I'm sure includes palestine. 5 min mom..... promised Ireland first lockdown would needed masks, social distancing government providing contact tracing. 

Two lockdowns later confirm government failed public responsibility protect elderly, get contact tracing running provide easy access payment scheme quarantine covid.

I wish got contact tracing running airports closed get 0 covid cases like New Zealand last year. hindsight always biased guess Yes, also wouldn’t believe little people pay attention anything outside bubble.

Well it’s important differentiate. long term effects means something develops shortly inoculation affects patient long time yes definitely possible.

If he’s asking long term effects, develops years inoculation, no, isn’t possible vaccines.

Edit: note none observed vaccines currently used local school district fully open since late August lots lots kids test positive. half symptoms rest symptoms less severe regular flu. get adults vulnerable people vaccinated, would think even worry it. Wrong. 10% vaccinated. lying vaccination rates well publicized? Way keep public’s trust, CNN. Fake news, CNN. Same, business trip next town first confirmed cases found Germany January. 
And amazingly, actually manage cut line completely, new cases while/the next cases completely different locations. single case Melbourne caused late night press conference.

Six months enough time body stop making COVID antibodies. shit happens. doses still made. I've ubered times wear mask, driver wears mask, crack windows airflow (even cold out).

Always felt fine me! talk Walgreens, CVS, Walmart giving vaccine, mean Johnson Johnson going approved soon? think timeline saw CVS Feb. 11th. Yes, family suffers long Lyme sounds similar. Unfortunately, gets people thinks faking it, like COVID long haulers do. Sadly, neither lingering viral infection people doubt nothing new, hopefully gets people start caring enough put research learn happens treat think hoarding much people home before, using used to. never stopped working, home habits never changed, using started.

Of course people started panicking started. says didn’t hear pandemic resulted, didn’t hear COVID. point got car accident, wasn’t pandemic yet, similar Ebola SARS outbreaks point. Imagine waking find everyone wearing masks made aware millions died span coma Yeah thanks giving shit lives. suppose 80% us wanting event happen doesn’t matter. Outside observers. I'm sorry hard , please better options. know feel , hate shit sometimes I've even contemplated messing substances forget everything going on. Things getting better though , fuck bullshit fear mongering variants vaccines proven effective them. feel like talking though feel free pm vaccines still effective mutations, although less. Still enough keep millions hospital. We'll probably feel stage 1 much stage 2. never much money travel begin lol  Really reason lockdowns US work everyone work live, know tons people would want nothing bunker wait out, work grocery clerk cashier pay rent eat.

The real question though pay people stay home pay accelerate vaccine rollout. UK seems chosen it'd nice US would actually get checks once... earlier I’m sure US  live us better get vaccine least august go crazy. Im scared ill afraid show face back ""normal"" showed face 8 months. hate looks even used to. Im going back school 1000 unvaccinated kids get covid trying get it. I'm surprised Russia's cure big rock thrown someone's face funny!!! *Then put little hand mine
There ain't hill mountain can't climb* covid cured coma lol mNRA vaccines adapted new strains weeks (distribution needs get better still, though). used always bidet spray/hose/nozzle hooked toilet. 40$ Target. Easy install worked wonders (i.e. cleaned everything thoroughly). Meanwhile saw headline Tokyo terrible shape right suddenly spikes ICU. Fake news racists / xenophobic rationalizations tbh. say trust white American made vaccines Technically covid-19 cases linked travel. removed others. Roman goddess Victoria often used symbol victory Russia, name pronounced same. mRNA vaccines technically created super rapidly, around Feb/March 2020? completely untested... vaccine still undergoing phase 3 trials. happy looks like effective, though.  got one fancy heated bidets loved much added second unheated bidet second bathroom. Nothing makes feel bougie wanting use second bidet water cold.

Having use toilet paper feels like I'm trying clean ass 80 grit sand paper.

As added bonus wife loves fancy bidet also femine wash shoots forward cleaning time month.  Wow, that's sad hear. well containing virus longest time. Alcohol, perfectly legal dangerous drug, numbs anxiety loneliness. Interesting respond good news ""yikes"". Ok sounds like name made talk front patients freak out. 2020 best year spend coma since, like, 1945, probably. heard county worked chick fil national guard figure logistics haha. haven’t heard single complaint anyone area getting vaccine (if they’re qualified). 

I hope something like also used everyone else able get vaccine. Agreed. may like vaccine want forced put something body, respect someone else may want put body. got first shot last week. Even though still sceptic really hope effective. Last week December 2019 started get pretty alarmed COVID. saw couple viral WeChat videos bodies piling Wuhan hospitals, heard one audio clip particularly rattled me– it nurse Wuhan hysterically crying saying something like ""we can't keep patients dying. one outside China realizes bad things here..."". fear hopelessness voice really shook me, hearing contagious virus dawned thing going stop national borders likely going hit us US.

That late December 2019. friends thought alarmist last long. Here's revelation. hear letter B comes right A, definitely C. Crazy, know. truly wonder might think he’s actually dead living alternate universe

I coma past year wondering transported alternate universe. *Oh boy, can't wait go see favorite sports teams play person!* Get toast super jelly guy Convicted what? far know closed Dodger stadium ""an abundance caution"", anti vaxxers anything illegal? UK, former army captain-turned charity fundraiser died contracting COVID. He'd hospital pneumonia tested positive hours returning home. I’m pretty sure waking hospital people wear medical gear wouldn’t exactly surprising.... wouldn’t less creepy waking coma general. Lots grouches subreddit, you’re far first notice it. like big company US government. Honest question: exactly opening now? one liberal states America (Washington state) movie theatres restaurants open. Movie theaters open since April 2020 deaths hundreds still ~3k deaths today? inconsistency? coincidence everything opening less 2 weeks Bidens office? Honest question, wait reddit keyboard warrior respond. body prepared get downvoted I'd ask could induce another 9 months teacher also works part time job essential employee completely understand teachers concerned returning schools. thought. Plus getting economy going benefit us well worry good authority going gone Easter 2020. studies literally like 100 people, online survey, consider ""covid symptoms"" include ""anxiety"". Maybe mean indirectly like lockdowns?

I would worry much information. Worldwide 76 million people recovered widespread problem lasting symptoms think we'd hear it. Also long term symptoms viruses like flu chicken pox. unheard of. let's math. 330 million (ish) people US 40 million kids eligible yet, that's 290 million. supposedly 40% US opt drops 180 million want vaccination.

first vaccination december 21 done 40 million doses since (just 40 days), means absolutely supply distribution changed we'd 130 million doses 65 million people last day april, ideal course.

7 day rolling average right 1.4 million doses we're already speeding up. based recent news looks like doubling next weeks likely course johnson johnson approved end month doses added pipeline well. 

if bet? id say end may end june much likely, start seeing 3 million doses day extended period know right speed make happen end april. going do, tell people skip vaccine *that works get months* get COVID? 

""Hey, 5, 10% chance *tops* becomes lifelong regret! Go it!""

That's incredibly stupid. Yes yes 👏  “Maricopa County administered 153,000 doses COVID-19 vaccine, wasted doses represent 0.3% vaccines administered. Dr. Humble, executive director Arizona Public Health Association former state health director, says better track record federally funded Vaccines Children program, 3% wastage average.” federal government said they're going start shipping vaccines directly pharmacies instead state. cut middle man speed things up. That's works, honestly. hone antigenic component necessarily conserved? think Measles? part, easy vaccinate against.

Easier said done. think don’t universal flu vaccine yet? Literally point local govt see things like this. Truly insane propaganda strong country people think better things possible all. definitely possible; guess I'm thinking inconvenience (not sure that's quite word want...). would essentially create kind security checkpoint door absolutely everywhere. Also everyone smartphone. Also, herd immunity reached, seems like there's reason go that. exactly fauci said news day along saying they’re starting studies vaccine isn’t free ticket whatever.... YET. unfortunately real info still piled massive heap bullshit. got covid back July visiting doctor. time quarantined full lockdown. Groceries delivered home working home. Went doctor really to. 5 days later got infected. high viral load hospitalized me. best part hospital getting treated covid learned doctors nurses infected deaths amongst them. sad really public messaging already? Yes, again, problem got overrun able properly track stuff. 

The evidence Manaus herd immunity got hit badly despite that. That's it. That's evidence. agree 100% 😂😂😂 do, none US states supply constrained moment, sense supply main limiting factor existing vaccination speeds. Virginia far used 69% existing supply according Bloomberg, states less that. 

Israel moment enough doses vaccinate entire adult population, able utilize existing doses faster countries. vaccines also less effective new strains. There's reason think current crop vaccines would effective enough naturally acquired immunity not. Supposedly little. article state one registered nurse believed vaccine contained “live virus” would harm family. think it’s safe say many practical nurses registered nurses United States also receive poor (or no) education research methods. need ban social contact forever.

I know sounds minor petty compared serious issues COVID bring, one main reasons vigilant avoiding whole loss smell/taste thing. Food one main passions, idea weeks maybe months would lose enjoyment part life seems like extra shit.  forget ridiculous tiktok trends girlfriend forces help with. Palestinian citizenship also israel ship enough? decide logistics literally millions families wide ranges dietary restrictions life-threatening allergies, US alone. Sure, buddy. delivers food? Assembles family food packaging? Takes orders complaints problems? nurses aides, much education think have?  Man reading sentence turned on. scientifically illiterate though. I've seen prominent scientists, including Hawkin, claim tv proof something therefore negative. dont doubt smart enough know statement includes silent 'until proven otherwise' careless use language encourages confusion. wait six months reach things normal think friendship worth it. social contact makes people crazy, I'd imagine start socializing people they'll become less dogmatic past beliefs. Universities schools fully opened yet (I'm waiting eagerly that, one year home much). However yeah, many people stopped wearing masks. damnit, thought already done lol pretty much assumed case first vaccines, too? part initial studies? started studies younger people people vaccinate, unnecessary measures become. 

If goal public health, waste money effort government. Unless already counting people vaccinated de facto creating apartheid society. sorry loss hurt wake up? I've never stupid wondering like.... even midterm elections important Maybe average 30 year old believe COVID 17% mortality rate, people clamoring invasive shit. fault, media panic.  Also increased heart rate &amp; change temperature basic infection response. Even two articles aren’t entirely bad news. 

The first article talking different endemic coronaviruses, which, prior covid, associated common cold. small sample 86 coronavirus-positive cases, 12 got reinfected (14% reinfections rate) “most” 12 children underdeveloped immune systems. words, kids get colds multiple times year. applicability current coronavirus strain unknown time article. 

The second article little concerning 10% participants second positive covid test. article makes mention potential false positives antibody test PCR test; PCR supposed pretty accurate can’t write false positives, unfortunatly. 

The good news study reinfected patients shorter illnesses higher instances asymptomatic compared infected first time. also lower antibody levels individuals didn’t get reinfected. I’m choosing positive, seems like better news could hope comes reinfections. study know 1) natural immunity seems offer protection, least first, people; 2) natural immunity doesn’t offer full protection, still led less serious cases; 3) reinfections appears associated antibody levels. Reinfected patients fewer antibodies patients weren’t reinfected higher antibody levels 

This last point actually best news bunch know vaccines trigger stronger immune response natural infections. people get vaccinated, wouldn’t surprising see rates reinfections decline. real threat mutating strains course. don’t know yet. 

As I’ve said elsewhere, three big questions reinfections 1) possible, 2) common, 3) serious issue. 

Number 1 satisfied. That’s yes. Number 2 seeming like “not really,” it’s soon tell. number 3. Thank God. Please keep giving beautiful beautiful news!!! I’d bet top dollar people 50 likely able work home people below. PCR tests, cases. case, may've pneumonia reasons, positive covid-19 PCR tests past week 2 well documented point.  took gamble. 

this something publicized more. every state took gamble. betting effectively long vaccine would take come out. vaccine take years states would look like geniuses, vaccine take months states would look like geniuses. 

at point, vaccine supply/distribution covers everyone wants numbers drop, lag times end, etc etc we'll able look back see right wrong.

unfortunately gamble impacts things like jobs, lives, long term health, education, etc etc none us would wanted make decisions would impact millions  bottleneck vaccine supply.

An unsupplied vaccine 0% efficacy, 62% better 0%. Interesting. heard this. Thank you! funny New York Times recently? weeks ago 67% reduction would called “moderate” best. it’s “drastic” imitate surrender monkeys embracing germs Yep, hospital, one dying, we'll get back normal. Imagine started one died rare even hospitalized. entirely different ballgame. Yup, remember talking point last years superbowl party. bunch friends backgrounds healthcare national security party actually bit concern regarding virus. First obvious standardize process far possible some. help regulation. Second, site-specific regulatory approvals *not* need wait pilot production (see Marburg). Third, know exactly long lead production (initial growth), apply DNA part production, rest relatively fast (Translation mRNA DNA *cannot* take months. mRNA stable.) *that* part production scaled pretty much infinitely (for needs process) plants already it: quadruple amount growing containers. again, necessary.  right. 8.2% population one dose 1.9% population 2 doses (""fully vaccinated"") writing (though understanding data-reporting lag, actuals may little think states reduction, total population, 49%. So, 67% reduction, 2nd dose, additional 49% reduction. really comparative one two doses, stating second dose also causes large drop positive covid cases. Cheers that. countries sent citizens food could quarantine. None Manaus Amazonas, though. OP mentioned Manaus specifically, far experience worst surge country. healthcare workers required take least one medical research methods course professional education. means soon see single person middle field National Park wearing mask real reason even though socially distanced everyone. “i got covid vaccine”? Oh look you...trying worry people. 
Health restrictions political decisions. That’ll brings end. least aint Walking Dead... Right guys? right?  see. Good know thanks! End May, wondering thing (answered someone else another comment: ) You’re downvoted saying large indoor events ever someone attempts block ability get vaccine cue, I’ll low speed I’m stopping. Yeah, he's even really person anymore, right?  know variants already circulating long time? wonder prognosis would terms brain function coma long. call paramedics? dunno. In-laws CA already vaccinated, mom's hubs NH Mar 1st. 

Ramp bit could easily hit weeks. 

This happening watching numbers grow. shot ready Mr Navalny. Aside others said snowstorm, vaccine reporting consistent day. seems Mondays Tuesdays smallest vaccine updates. Best compare new updates one day last week - compare today's last Tuesday's, little smaller, much. think people (everywhere) under-appreciating truth this. 10 years truly bad pandemic hits, one going comply restrictions.  ""Face"" arrest.

Uh huh. I'll believe actually happens. mean could worse living woke up. Circumstances woke matter. serious, moron. people ridicule people regardless political affiliation, assume ones superiority based solely party affiliation completely insane.

if joking, ya really need /s text hard understand intent. lol, guess it, might well get constant supervision hospital No. Absolutely not. think two instances life things completely changed worst way possible. would pick one those. “Put back in, doc. Wake over” Makes feel good inside :/ know virus less chances gets. vaccines also anti viral products. surprise effect virus disappearing day day. Francly see way virus. transition complete thr stuff gave Alexei Navalny? New Zealand wiping covid also wiped flu, amount people who're diagnosed flu fraction normally there's still illnesses go around. longer coma goes on, less likely people wake up, veeeery grateful. also complicates maintaining immunity global south lot. need enough sequencing keep vaccines updated, also need transport quickly updated mRNA vaccines remote communities keeping cool. There's also risk see almost negligible community spread, especially communities low vaccination rate, virus put enormous selective pressure evade vaccine. High chances reinfections tell people developed world COVID much smaller, still long term public health concern, could really bad thing everyone else. Indeed! However, parentheses unusual choice, part AP style guidelines use names honorifics. heard mixed reports. interfere, see problem. agree protest all, I'm gonna trample right protest even find outlandish. vaccine ineffective new variants back square one.

Not really. vaccine ineffective variants, mRNA based vaccines likely altered effective.  Since entire vaccine tested would little change version already use, accelerated testing validation schedule possible.

A working vaccine new variants could usable within month two, depending what's fast safe. we'd start distributing it.  months later everyone it, virus stops infecting. Hopefully reduced transmission due original vaccines giving virus less chances mutate would prevent new variants produced time.

Basically, would cost us months would otherwise case potentially LOT deaths due spikes caused new variants.


Look way: forest fire, long would put staying inside flameproof house stepping flames ""take chances""? LOL y’all I’m literally curious would happen. What’s downvotes? I’m thrilled hear CVS offering vaccines. Wtf wasn’t aimed us, could put us exemption list. declined put us exemption list. Must taper off. else! remember meeting February /March sometime telling everyone serious going affect world long time, possibly year more. burst laughter (I work Christians) completely ignored said. beings zoom I've working home since lol. difference countries, that...a sentiment. Americans makes phenomenon.  Lucky MFer  thought since virus got named SARS-Cov-2. remember SARS, original, followed news years afterward discussed people never got better. kept waiting media make connection, somehow still not. yes, people suspected ""long covid,"" name. want jinx but, seem like much better? We've significant drop cases, worldwide. going team GB taking part Oh Ok. Indirectly got India. best invention yet, 10.5 mL vial holds 20 doses vaccine. Waiting Nobel Prize Medicine. 

It always amazes difficult everything becomes GMP. find mind-boggling industry group stepped this. Many us aware standards jobs have. standards tons things, even desk chair may sitting in. 

And one sets standard, someone telling us test mask? 

Or say KN95 mask. know even mask really KN95 vs. fake KN95? administer epi-pen  “Though list countries exempt export controls, Canada it. Countries exempt include Norway Iceland.”

In statement released Tuesday, Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole criticized government exclusion.

""Why Justin Trudeau secured exception Canada European Union export ban?"" statement asked.”

Gee Mr. O’ Massive Toole, could Norway Iceland functionally within EU due Schengen? God guy real laugh.

Also gonna post articles every week?? export control ensure countries aren’t receiving fair share delays, frankly aimed UK AZ, Pfizer/Moderna Canada. never science, simply faith another name. sympathy here. People free kill liquor. Derek Lowe 🐐 Haha that's actually good plot prequel guesses: hooked vitals monitoring machines. numbers looked maybe increased heart rate something. might blood work every often protocol may run covid well. maybe care person found positive tested everyone care person came contact with. Actual interviews parents point safety concerns, rather concerns quality education kids receive return. Parents responding way appears think teachers jobs. Let give piece advice. Since tried get appointment father CVS NY. I'm assuming it'll similar TX. usually open slots 1 week advance. So, try get appointment online mins past midnight. Why? That's opening appointments next week. So, lot slots available. 
Appointments 15 mins apart. get appointment, select date first second dose. Print everything out. go phone show that. Print out.  


When time shot, sent separate area pharmacy(inside) certify info filled online(to book appointment). Everything must match. give okay(it usually takes 30 seconds less), take separate area give first shot. It'll likely Pfizer. inoculation, make sit 15 mins check reactions. let leave 15 mins passed. nurses on-site. They'll give papers need fill next appointment, that's okay. Tell already booked appointments.  


My father's reaction first shot sore arm day. take tylenol move around. gotten second shot yet, I'm sure sore arm again(knock wood). Something transmit virus next person use devise properly cleaned malfunction. shocked India. remember back months ago number going fully thought going massive problem. Great see wrong. Imagine checking bitcoin wallet :O vaccines suppress transmission. 

Vaccines work creating ton antibodies blood memory cells spleen lymph nodes. viruses don’t enter body directly blood stream. SARS-COV-2 gets mucosal tissues nose throat area. vaccine won’t stop virus replicating none components immune response make site (and intramuscular injections fairly shitty job directing immune response mucosa). 

This already seen non-human primate pre-clinical studies (though apologize- don’t remember vaccines result). Vaccinated animals didn’t SARS-COV-2 replication lungs, oral nasal mucosa. Lol Need new science teacher Since start December Germany experienced higher per capita death toll Covid France, obvious comparison. actually first case (I've heard) someone catching twice.

I've always waiting vaccine, sounds like banking sort natural immunity may bust? it’s buildings though. mean obviously alone trail lol. Walking people trail isn’t covid spreads there’s need mandate masks circumstances make people feel safe. guess guides policies point explain pandemic someone coma?

Umm, tell it? ""There's pandemic going last year"" 18, maybe following news virus outbreaks closely... much bills Nowhere eliminated covid. suppress closing borders inevitably comes back cycle continues. Comparing measles respiratory virus like covid really dumb, comparison fact viruses. Covid isn’t going away, reasonable expert suggesting zero covid feasible strategy read article:

""In press release issued Tuesday U.S. Department Interior, face masks required worn National Park Service buildings facilities. Masks also required park service-managed lands physical distancing cannot maintained, including narrow busy trails, overlooks historic homes""

So, mostly buildings, couple places outside make sense. Welcome 11 months ago, National Parks Service. Let’s hear assholes make fun vaccine like back august stupid videos. laughing now?! back life dude

it sucks talking **transmission** here.

I included preceding important question whether vaccines provide impact **transmission**, therefore combined physical distancing measures contribute reductions human human transmission virus. transmission studies per se included analysis, swabs obtained volunteers every week UK study, regardless symptoms, allow assessment overall impact vaccine risk infection thus surrogate potential onward transmission. impact vaccine asymptomatic infection, would expected efficacious vaccine would simply convert severe cases mild cases mild cases asymptomatic, overall PCR positivity unchanged. **A measure overall PCR positivity appropriate assess whether reduction burden infection.**

Edit: I'm also sure interpret, hope much data soon. Anecdotes mean virtually nothing.  meanwhile freelancer designing website still blames covid delays. Australia handles quiet better west. Wechat? not? Measles R0 insanely high. Many places eliminated Covid without vaccine, I'm sure vaccine get close that.

I've never quite understood Covid Supporters Club - can't domesticate replicant, green goo, let's science oblivion. said everyone high risk group wants one, everyone wants one. Covid doesn’t spread walking someone 10 seconds outdoors. That’s like struck lightning, rare chance. want it’s overkill imo I’m wearing mask outdoors hike another variant pop shut again. Get people? people want end He's nation's top epidemiology pandemic expert. else would like hear from? Seems inevitable though. misunderstanding causation — Pfizer agreed provide large amounts doses Israel **because** Israel able quickly vaccinate population. countries able same, perhaps would able reach similar deals.  prevent viruses replicating inside you, causing sick, reduce eliminate viral shedding (spreading virus, essentially).

I would say mostly true Sars-CoV2 vaccines, though I'd exclude ""or eliminate"" statement definitive, later say yourself.

But since speaking vaccines general, least couple big counter examples blanket statement vaccines ""prevent [...] viruses replicating inside you"".

The oral polio vaccine attenuated version virus, replicates fine gut, stimulates immune response results plenty (attenuated) viral shedding faeces. Unfortunately, due overall success polio vaccination program, vaccine derived cases mutated forms attenuated polio account significant number cases now.

Also, rotavirus vaccine sterilising provided significant reduction hospital visits. Though also live-attenuated virus doesn’t mean shouldn’t still act like you’re infectious you’re vaccinated, don’t know much vaccine prevents infection, almost certainly prevent substantial percentage minimum. Estimates I’ve seen north 65% reduction.

I think contradicts statement. Vaccinated people get disease. vaccinated people, symptoms greatly reduced symptoms still get serious symptoms vaccinated people still spread disease.

Now, 65% reduction spread (assuming likely scientifically confirmed) probably eliminate lot mass outbreaks serious outcomes, especially vaccinated cohort. sense, hugely optimistic likely effects widespread vaccination campaign, I'm cautious definitive data. sure? isn’t clear. People requiring masks indoors awhile anyways parks seen crowded parks past year? passing groups people every 5 seconds trail, probably good idea wearing mask, even outdoors. common sense says two bullets better ? Haha good point. But, obviously, rather opt best vaccine, CHOICE 😂😂 yeah, agree. much completely unknown. would reduce transmission almost certain. base pandemic health guidelines ""yeah, probably."" think charity name appropriate. seemed like giving man, would probably something would preferred buildings park, outdoors. That’s extreme overkill opinion. Covid doesn’t spread walking quickly someone hike. kind overkill restrictions make people less likely follow restriction truly important. ""The Danish government said decide later whether digital passport used purposes travel help reopen public life.""

Sorry, right, vaccine stuff actually handled pretty well, personal shock see two things sentence. Russia started using Sputnik-V late Fall , 2020. skipped Phase III testing, reliable efficacy data now. agree it’s theoretically true. least am, data put zero confirmation it’s true. could put name John Doe. one asked verification. 30 million doses already administered, that’s potentially 30 million unverified people there. hundred thousands doses given everyday, number could 50 even 100 million rollout would possible.  JW -- ""ignoring Moderna?"" bc there's lack data # distributed? tiny subset people seem get telling people processing emotions around once-in-a-generation pandemic right way? That’s cool. that’s mostly normal looks like, I’m definitely looking forward it. Correcting mistakes one thing. fact education specifically arena. Sure odd balls it’s coincidence doctors around country getting vaccinated much higher rates medical personnel.

Think way. would doctors need forced medical personnel? far less doctors country would theoretically much leverage decline vaccine wanted since much higher demand professionally. I’ve heard, rural Arkansas wasn’t following guidelines stores forbid mask wearing Allegedly know... manufacture large scale. angry? 😂😂😂 Sure. took 3 seconds google

RSV: flu: want continue conversation based reality want continue illogical path. data long term effects Covid robust right now. studies self reported surveys. course, media run long term effects narrative. total fear mongering. virus give long term symptoms, still don’t know Covid higher rate compared others.

At point obvious trolling. Russia never poisoned foreign nationals before? Get grip.

Go piddle anti-truth nonsense elsewhere. toilet paper wasnt really hoarding though. Believe lot people toilet using work involves different supply chains... everyone home demand overwhlemed normal use... presume know anything all. I've worn masks. contact friends anymore except screens messaging programs (who needs friends people, amirite?)

But undermined credibility admitted lying mask efficacy, admitted moving goalposts specifically trick people following policies, going around telling everybody vaccine nothing else done matters there's apparently unlimited number ""Super-COVIDS"" waiting kill us anyway. Weird, 75. Could listening anti vaxxers want say so? donating vaccine research, maybe extra prudent wait side-effects thoroughly documented.  wear 1 box masks? Heretic! Lord Fauci (Mask Upon Him) told us wear 5 boxes masks! must bathe holy hand sanitizer repent sins. put context that’s 1/6 UK population vaccinated media isn’t ready move clicks views get lazy reporting. going keep overblowing small issues fear sells better good news. importantly, symptom suppression vaccines stopping least drastically reducing viral replication vaccinated host. like steroid Advil get symptom reduction, symptom reduction/prevention directly due suppressed virus replication/immune system killing virus spread. 

Therefore would strange transmission seriously reduced.

Now, impossible transmit 80-99% less likely? That's TBD need studies like this. pretend idea could 0 impact misleading probably crowd control science. Lol raise back multitude studies showing level transmission directly linked viral load _and_ symptoms vaccines significantly drive down, no, 100% realistic expect vaccines _reduce_ transmission. Nobody expected measles levels sterilizing immunity either, anyone claiming realistic result vaccines _no_ effect transmission nonsense.

Also sub very, _very_ recently shifted anything short ""covid last till 2030"" that's downright hilarious thing say perspective Ok don’t trust anything comes russia  changed mind according later research

What research? ever seen research changed mind? even know about? repeating words heard people say without thinking mean true? think likely happen get whichever shot get hands year, 30-50% effective time. vaccine evading mutant inevitably going appear (and part, already here), take booster shot sometime 2022 better protection. I'm afraid year go ""better nothing"" would bring number significantly 50% **eager** get it.

They eager get it. want wait see. That's basically complete opposite brazenly incorrect since peddles BS narrative 50% getting vaccine.

Maybe. maybe, would spent half second asked source willing see meant (or read second comment makes obvious including ""wait see"" 50%), would known talking appreciate pedantic conversation attempt condescending seems like going head.

Get high horse. led response guy ass, please lecture condescending. here- got vaccinated yesterday going close closing time waiting see spare vaccines left. gave end it. Thanks posting calculator, interesting see different variables, ceiling height, affect risk. that’s natural response people. Show they’re worried maybe V Vodka! 🧐  science disagrees this. Outdoor natural breeze ventilates much better significantly safer indoors. Thank you. Several years ago though, woman side swipe car. mother died. Loss, especially close loss, addle brain absolutely. almost necessity, think. ended getting extremely tired. One things kids experienced pandemic realization grateful grandmother passed able die sleep peacefully family around (we unable go sick flu help us). Far many grandparents worse yet, way they've died horrifying. thing grateful personal string losses additional motivation rest family moment warned Jan 16th come avoid additional deaths. told slowly building supply things they'll need, so. told mask February, masked end coming terms recognized pure sorrow. We've actually extraordinarily lucky this. friends family warned, we've 2 infected. lose one family member COVID January but, sadly, estranged way contacting him. science disagrees this. Outdoor natural breeze ventilates much better significantly safer indoors. mean, it’s okay want wear masks. hate wearing masks. think idea wearing masks outside nature stupid mostly COVID theater. 

So result won’t go national parks revoked. Probably 6 months so. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Congrats mom, FDA clarification allergies. US Food Drug Administration (FDA) clarified guidance administration Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, stating **safe people history allergies, might known history severe allergic reaction component vaccine.""**

List vaccine ingredients: (Pretty standard vaccine components, definitely include shrimp) Yeah, selfish pricks want lose everything! dare try make living end homeless destitute! Newsom getting recalled Whitmer verge getting recalled, Ron DeSantis Kristi Noem credible candidates Republican Party’s president nominees 2024.

It says lot much (or little) people actually like lockdowns mask mandates. I’ll take celebs cognizant social optics day even it’s purely superficial...at least she’s trying appear right thing unlike famous people  look Pfizer's graph, clear evidence decrease symptomatic infections around day 11, take incubation period account protection begins earlier that. Hard say percentage sample size small point. even allowed know reality is? tomorrow? Whatever Fauci spouts time?  could something they’ve never done character? Putin poisoned Russian double agent living UK, therefore wants poison whole world insane leap logic. interest you, grandiose sense importance. 

That NATO didn’t care 2 randoms died crossfire speak would happen millions people killed deliberately poisoned vaccine. would act terrorism never seen before.

Russia exports food medicine every single day. start poisoning randoms now? gain? give one thing would gain maybe could discussion.

But right sound like propagandized raving lunatic idea world works Currently vaccines preventing death variants still offer good protection severe cases. get deaths get people hospital still get back relative normal.

If people want wear masks forever, go right ahead. Wow! 24 days! Wow that's sweet offer help. Thanks! I'll try let know. sometimes feel like body development mode. Thank Thank Even easier don’t count additional 5 million Palestinians direct military control occupied territories. Nah Eternal Atake came week pandemic first lockdown measures starting. seems fitting shit album came week world go shit. people freaking out? long keeps family getting super sick, I'm happy. noted we’re getting SinoPHARM vaccine, SinoVAC. Sinovac one like 50% efficacy, Sinopharm around 80%, according interim (meaning still haven’t published complete results medical journal) 3rd phase data. It’s thanks we’re 2nd Europe (behind UK) number vaccinated people per capita. literally showed basis reality. :-) :-) Darwinism finds way. Yup, money would two mRNA ones we’ve already rolled out. r/angryupvote Well actually idea. It’s truly governments fault. lockdowns lack Covid restrictions killed ruined people. country entire mess imo (in US). actually believe leisure air flights (especially internationally) done new variants. FDA, general, huge pressure big pharma, meat industries (antibiotics recombinant growth hormones), agriculture. Plenty food addictives pesticides allowed little published toxicology Even variants vaccines 100% effective stopping hospitalizations. one willfully ignorant. citing number basis reality. blue checkmark PHD Twitter told face melt wear 50 masks times. long O.J. Simpson vaccinated, right world..... /s 2% US population 6.62 million people. vaccinated 5 times 32 million. Here's another part problem - willful ignorance refusal listen anything contradicts already held beliefs.

Worldometer lists present count cases 27,031,068 deaths 457,974.  457974/27031068= 0.01694/1, converting percentage figure, 1.7%. 

Of people contracted virus US, 1.7% died.  corpses prove this. need estimates guesses. _any circumstances_ used primary diagnostic test.

What? vaccine passed trial better vaccine. one shot better shot. focus vaccinating many people possible fast possible. seem conflating single incidences mass effect. imply anything small minority people heart problem covid silly. Hell yeah! 

A Post Malone show last fun public activity shit went hell.

That's laugh ignore anything says like cause know every word mouth bullshit lies get people comply.  responded OP down. want know specifically help dad's financial security. Air travel voluntary.

I'm going bars getting airplane ""normal activities"". get OP's point regarding dad. can't save dad's job financial future. live Tampa Bay. article doesn’t even tell whole story. large event called NFL Experience attracts thousands people day. think it’s almost two weeks closed days.

Yes, mask policy. No, city doesn’t power enforce (thanks, DeSantis!). 

I get it. I’m excited Super Bowl, I’d love go see NFL Experience. it’s really good time this... 

It’ll special Super Bowl spike Tampa Bay. 🤷‍♀️ anywhere CAN'T replicate?! coronaviruses infect EVERYTHING?? thing recently. piece mind knowing parents getting protected now, immeasurable :) read it. 

Then intentionally misrepresenting it. 

Be better that. NPR non-profit much better. Again, show study showing people getting infected hikes. anecdotes, actual data. It’s extremely rare. Even outdoors standing near someone. It’s covid spreads wonder makes good argument us skeptical lockdowns? Unless situation involves authoritarian government island nation, seems like they're likely hurt help, that's perception. deaths still high, cases seem way time open soon. No, easy. immune system learns recognize viral vector, makes future treatments challenging conduct. RNA lipid nanoparticles simpler, effective long-term treatment option. read it. don’t think need wear mask trails walking someone briefly. Based studies covid transmission scenario far unlikely cause infection mask overkill. Correct multiple layers bodies immunoresponse. Presence antibodies confirms immune preparedness lack imply lack preparedness. 1/5 th adults :) Numbers?  I'm sure think detecting PCR test. may may ""infection"".  pretty clear made bunch comments without reading article, people quoted article, want admit overly dramatic considering actual rules are. 

But again, anybody else reading this, here's Masks also required park service-managed lands physical distancing cannot maintained, including narrow busy trails, overlooks historic homes"" think time thing. Like first number 21 days first dose, 21 days opportunity spread. 49.5% **overall**. 21 days first dose plus time doses (maybe 21 days?) plus another 14 days second dose. 56 days opportunity spread. America never even singled down. one worst responses pandemic entire world.

Americans even minimum. I'm frankly sick tired hearing whiny Americans wahh ""measures"" much. freaking measure? done anything still whine. America truly pathetic country full terrible lazy people. Umm... crazy think people continue wear masks even deaths flu level deaths. Oral polio one. Yes it’s method delivery. machinery make IgA underlies Like, goal get population vaccinated level provides herd immunity can't (or, unfortunately won't) vaccinated.

A goal exist independent lockdowns. exist public health goals vaccinations. [Here's bevy federal correct among first actual data (there Israel could likely lead conclusion BNT vaccine).

But agree ""no shit"" sentiment, even though nice put number it. 95% very, different 70% regard. 

So, uh, number? link article headline disappeared it. case, tested three doses? Eh call country democratic even tho capitol city opposition mayor reducing transmission eliminating. People get vaccine still chance spreading virus. Also different mutations vaccines quite effective against. confusing vaccines motor oil. Compare countries similar populations - Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, Portugal, Sweden, etc.  They're way better countries too.

Meanwhile, U.S. huge population, far better anyone else deploying vaccines except Israel, U.K., UAE. Unless sequencing every positive case, assumed already community spread. doesn’t sound right?

The recall people fringe California politics modern major media become obsessed short, low quality, clickbait, alarmist stories.

DTJ gone, media come rely easy stories generated, looking ways keep writing stories. Hence freaking pandemic true vaccines respiratory viruses? Like measles? figure non-silly names call all.

Novid. Geez can’t see could abused 1. long term studies. 2. refusing vaccine..i patiently waiting turn... mean can't worried it. Yeah countries problem man. 

Yeah whatever rules set. know ethics information, information EXACTLY trials run etc. included study yes? US somr magic place scientific rigour lives rest world crazy. 

You surprised amount extent protocol deviations ethics violations countries, well extent US.

FDA lot protections regulations compared countries. 

And Europe one entity comes drugs. surprised see approved banned Ukraine, compared Germany UK. surprised OTC Netherlands neighboring countries. Even healthcare systems across EU, infact medicine training standards exactly uniform across Europe either. 

So no, depending upon country live in, may rigor ethics drug trials. care, may necessarily logistics. 

And wrong certain countries EU accepting results drugs/devices/vaccinations cause approved trialed US. Several drugs/devices banned US allowed countries EU, drugs/devices banned EU countries approved sold US. obviously familiar this. know ethics information, information EXACTLY trials run etc. included study yes? 

Yes ofcourse aware created many. However, access reports shows IMPLEMENTED CONDUCTED exactly way be? Usually presented publications, access complete reports. example, oxford vaccine fumbling dosage administration. big deal cause spotlight vaccine trials, hence knew fumbling. Something basic ensuring right dosage administered messed up, brings protocol conduction questioning. within scientific community, noticed. waiting rest publications reports come in. sure, country government say crisis make law  It’s completely unreasonable hypothesis, it’s far confirmed looking shaky sequencing

They definitely here, probably enough caused winter surge Every European country least form hybrid national insurance nationalised healthcare system. People love say US alone nationalised healthcare that's true (not support M4A).

What sets America apart *cost* here, necessarily system different. Tomorrow they’re going come saying “The South African variant US since November” Switzerland denied AZ distribution rites due poor quality trials well. possibly legal? Seems like two groups. One group got two shots less 6 weeks apart, 55% effective. group got two shots 3 months apart, 82% effective. combine stats groups together that's overall 76% effective (meaning 3 month group considerably larger 6 week group). really riled up, I'm quite calm willing discussion. stop dramatic OTT, could maybe talk. want shout someone. I'm tired too. are. ""You vaccines legally paid contract! resisted urge seize them! welcome! Man, we're good guys. Let's hear us!"" Yes. idea UK found variant first therefore must exist logical. evidence suggest variants localized. could widespread already. know.

The travel bans UK SA government responses media fear mongering variants, COVID. 

Its coincidence countries genetic sequencing also happen ones highest amount variant infections. regulators barrier. Even changing manufacturing method tiny bit massively onerous. 
This area expertise - process - it’s difficult know start. move rationalise pharma industry - it’s ultra-risk averse. 
PAT QBD coming paradigms, it’s slow
(Also affinity matrix materials cost 1m dollars kilo, scale also cost issue). There’s limited organized data, certainly nothing suggest prior infection provides reduced immunity compared vaccination strain. I'm sure think better option RT PCR antigen testing  someone else job, would moving goalposts like him. variants concern, likely % need high. Exactly. bigger are, nurses have. It’s question enough vaccines moment. well organisation. Israel decided pay per vaccine. Floriduhhh-oh Except People claim reinfected tested positive twice 6 months apart mean harcore lockdown like Israel September cases came crawling back soon eased it?

They way lockdowns would work went full eradication closed borders, like Australia New Zealand. would take months get current numbers economy would crash completely. ship sailed long time ago... 

So stuck current restrictions nothing prey work. bad.

Yes... people became infected, chances mutation. monoclonal antibodies used, chances mutation. people immunocompromised infected, chances mutations. larger pandemic grows, faster mutations occur. Hence, initial two mutations (one cause Wuhan outbreak, another increased infectivity started Europe/NA pandemic), fortunate see major mutations November. we've seen least 6 past 3 months, expect rate increase greatly reduced total number infected. 1) newsom’s still 50% approval

The vaccines 100% effective preventing hospitalization death, even new variants. 

If try say wait everyone get ""next generation"" vaccine going back normal, people need refuse. Otherwise, always new variant people ""concerned"" always updated vaccine coming ""just months"", would never get rid restrictions.  Personally feel though serious kick balls comes taking anything granted. Two years ago idea meal friends something would bored work one day. extremely long list things would give lot experience.

I absolutely go back acted prior hopefully see lockdown norm, take every 'old normal' experience treasured luxury! India's Serum Institute supply 1.1 billion doses COVID-19 vaccines developed AstraZeneca Novavax COVAX vaccine scheme part new long-term deal, head U.N. Children's Fund said Wednesday. seen single person Melbourne complain done they're reaping rewards. means conclusively beat thing Australia, kind response absolutely worth compared dragging things months neither normalcy control virus. y’all lockdown everytime there’s single case. Super free Yes. Tennessee prioritizing 75+.

Vaccines point generally available 75+ Tennessee. Anyone group able get appointment point. health officials ladies gentlemen understand rate COVID spreads could actually overtake rate vaccination given many people haven’t vaccinated? COVID already really high R0, variants spread even faster. happened wouldn’t doom Wisconsin another year COVID could problem months  Shit feel bad, im sorry know idea proper way clean mobile phone. wife uses hand sanitizer imagine good touch screen.

Personally, started use hand lotion pandemic constant thorough hand-washing turned hands red raw. Nope. America mot letting anything out. EU supplying everyone else. Indeed, although manufacturer, two major ones efficacy data outside joint statement Pfizer BioNTech said, “The safety efficacy vaccine evaluated different dosing schedules majority trial participants received second dose within window specified study design . . . data demonstrate protection first dose sustained 21 days.”

The European Medicines Agency said gap first second doses Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine exceed 42 days. “Any change would require variation marketing authorisation well clinical data support change, otherwise would considered ‘off-label use,’” agency said.

They use different style production, may that, simply untested, headline figures refer half-vaccinated per manufacturers, needs borne mind evaluating numbers. Personally think larger population defence better overall population smaller higher protection, still think worth taking headlines full picture don’t sufficient data judgement

And whose fault that, huh? would way get data. Hmmm..... gives another reason tell kids can’t get dog Az far easiest store compared say pfizer since requires stored fridge temperature. Although mRNA vaccines still fairly nee time may find difficult store.

She definitely knows reputation good putting others first saying image. convince brainwashed section population let us? need instead restrictions travelers, matter citizenship country origin. Every person arriving US required test negative twice Covid-19 maximum 36 hours travel begins. first test PCR test, show whether person active infection. second IgM antibody test, show whether person recently infected may still contagious. travelers recently vaccinated may negative PCR test result positive antibody test due vaccine recent infection. cases, additional antibody test directed proteins targeted current vaccines would required. arrival US, travelers tested rapid antigen test PCR test. know already tests miss cases anywhere 20% 100% time, depending course infection they’re administered. means even traveler tests negative travel upon arrival, still required isolate minimum two weeks controlled facility. We’re talking vague promises head directly home stay there, we’re talking supervised isolation temperatures monitored, tests administered, fall ill treated cared without risking spread countries — Australia, China, New Zealand Taiwan name — followed approach proven successful spread disease new variants. Indeed, places even stringent restrictions. Hong Kong, example, requires three weeks quarantine controlled facility follow tests. Mainland China requires three week quarantine period, though last week can, now, served home. restrictions haven’t prevented travelers carrying variants country, prevented variants spreading becoming new dominant strain. knew US blocked exports begin absolutely love “listen science” crowd conveniently ignores data need heavy viral load it’s essentially impossible superspreader event outside.

Who said thats thing german government could do?



First masks december, 9 months covid started. elderlies only.



First Corona rapid tests available 02/2021, one year Covid started. People still pay 80€ stupidly slow PCR-tests january every fool gets 8€ France 6€ Poland since half year already.



Still half much testing general everyone else it. needs testing anyway see bad infection spreading, right?! Lets assume random numbers Heinsberg studies 8 months ago, elder people far less present rest country. always: Fantasies preferred facts reality.



First virus-tracing 01/2021, 11 months Covid started. needs know infected who, right? Lets state like fact 08/20 (Laschet: *""Schools spreading virus""*) despite knowledge whatsoever.



No, truly, thing government could *""mOrE lOcKdOwNs hARdER REguLaTioNs""* . 



You totally nailed one. Yeah still need second doses. second doses good generating good long term immunity. can't stop vulnerable groups given one dose. need long term Immunity! Unfortunately, us young people (K-12, college students) going dealing BS rules long, long time. spite fact virus 99.997% survivability rate 20. fear campaign young people worked far well, entire generation pretty much brainwashed. summary, TG broad-spectrum antiviral targeted major human respiratory viruses RSV, coronaviruses (in particular SARS-CoV-2) influenza viruses, distinguish single-virus combined-virus infections. effective antivirals intervene active infection, especially initial stages disease, much needed, even availability vaccines. Given emergence coronavirus mutants, may undermine vaccines currently use development, major respiratory viruses co-circulating populations, effective antivirals discriminate virus types necessary manage current future pandemics. enormous potential practical benefits TG current antivirals envisaged general practice, orally administered broad-spectrum antiviral could dispensed for
early intervention without need establish specific respiratory virus diagnosis; antiviral fulfil integral role vaccines reducing public health burden SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses. 

So vaccine, rather envisaged treatment would given onset *any* respiratory virus symptoms, shorten cure infection.

Also in-vitro experiments, whole phase-1, -2, -3 sequence yet done. Snippet Dr. Rai - 

Do vote undo this. understand politics this. don’t like done. you’re legislature don’t like governor done, that’s fine. Argue among find solution. Pass new mask mandate. Don’t get rid one. one like, guess, however politics work. would worst time history undo something. truly result Wisconsin people losing lives. It’s wrong thing do,” says Dr. Rai. know joking. Okay, immune response quite simple ""number antibodies"". Remember, antibodies exist system months B-cells take remembering fight illness.

The vaccine proven produce higher numbers antibodies natural immunity almost cases. 

Does mean never get virus again? necessarily. means body primed launch LARGER attack virus ever get again, thus less likely get sick.

The latest study says level sterilizing immunity high perfect. Meaning small number people still pass covid (2%) receiving vaccine. unlikely develop symptoms certainly hospitalized themselves. Repealing mask mandate won’t make difference fast return normal. mindset “more masks restrictions means get back normal faster” wrong. data looked pretty decent, check kinggutterbaby IG (weird name shes legit covid researcher) breakdown stories yesterday still probably live.

He could stick that. forgot free coffee. Except fact ""private"" companies HEAVILY funded state actors. fact, would vacxines without funding. contagious Covid even display symptoms. vaxxed not, think would magically know stay away kid two days became symptomatic Covid? Lol. kid would likely exposed either way. .

Also one saying vaccines prevent transmission. said 100% sure enough yet answer question. 

Finally, children getting hit Covid way adults are.  kid much higher chance losing Covid way around. 

There zero logical ways getting Covid vaccine ""endangers"" child.  means practice get sick, going find covid means trapped house month. Honestly thought. loving limelight much everyone hanging words he's trying prolong magic.   Enough lazy \~troll farm\~ comments....

&amp;#x200B;

Just say rebuttal. “we” issue, “me” issue. don’t get vaccinated? really say care community? I’ll go ahead answer right now- No, cannot. Never ever think would see opinion coming NPR.

That said, agree. vast majority died past wars 18-25 years old. entire lives ahead left behind young families. deaths also direct impact US economy terms lost future economic productivity.

 every life valuable, young people indeed die COVID, death impacts family, one say someone 80 entire life front them. Comparing 95 year old dies COVID 19 year old died Normandy completely irresponsible comparison.  never happened place serious lockdown, Wuhan, NZ, Vietnam. mitigation measures place, like quarantining mass testing.

You get majority population stay home, yes, people still work. copy successful countries done, hard? Yeah, I’m actually surprised it’s around 10% already. 

We keep mind lot 10% “easy” cases: Health care workers could pop office hall get jab. still, that’s *awful*. page OP. demanding change anyone. want stay locked away society, go it. want get enjoy normalcy, go it. 

We asked (demanded cases) people like fundamentally upset lives feel illusion safety. 

I expect ANYONE change behaviors societal norms me. right. old basically sounds like even stronger argument longer period someone can't even isolate home family need provide childcare Unfortunately people US think Slovakia reasonable sacrifice “save one life” Tons people aren’t vaccinated show symptoms, one reason spreads fast. get vaccinated, still small chance get reinfected, prevents it, less likely give child. 

I’m hospital social worker baby. got vaccinated would less likely bring home prevent it. Also, children handle symptoms right better adults child got it, would likely okay could pass could severe symptoms. also protecting yourself. husband work, anyone else home, may bringing home child vaccinated help protect spreading child. make sense? feel like it’s hard get point across I’m here.

Edit: COVID around thanksgiving give child didn’t show symptoms, did. I’m hoping double antibodies vaccine, won’t able bring home get sick again. wish did! added information regarding question bottom megacomment, below. general thinking kids unlikely suffer serious symptoms. child underlying issues yes, would still careful bringing covid house. would concerned child catching covid you? greatest fear getting sick leaving kids motherless, would definitely want get vaccinated. get vaccinated worry son getting covid regardless vaccination status. 

Covid presents little risk children. According CDC statistics, children died flu covid since pandemic started, despite extremely low rates flu infection year: vaccine greatly reduces chances spreading virus. article front page sub right now: article concerns Astra Zeneca vaccine, Pfizer Moderna vaccines expected even effective. Right 336. dropping daily rate looking late March start open anything again. 

Nothing phased, pretty much sit home watch Netflix government says ok

Its gotten tiring say least Go breathe air moldy basements Actually he's making number “When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci, took first dose Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, told Times. “Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ‘I nudge bit,’ went 80, 85.

This outrageous. throws number based science thinks people need hear. kind recovery even possible significant amount cases? would guess forever debilitating brain disabilities? even applied yet, far know.  think it, FDA regulation, takes 3 weeks meeting consider it, days meeting recommendation actually approve it.

There's going awful lot ""I threw away masks early wish I'd waiting months vaccine, long COVID"" articles coming then. Countless reddit threads about: ""after get vaccinated, continue wear masks/social distance""? 

These often (I assume) well meaning people. like, holy crap, *yes*. Today's safe concert would probably look like 3,000+ plus people got second dose something like that. Well that's disappointing. hoping could kill two birds one stone. way mean terms workers? Neoliberals like truth. definitely restricted kids.

In September. 

A lot western scientists crapped contact traced outbreaks done early places like South Korea. studies hire skywriting planes write ""IT'S AIR.""

A lot due U.S. tv media choosing use airtime regarding virus spreads poorly. newspapers magazine case aerosols since June, time I've seen depth reporting on, MSNBC, instance, literally last night Chris Hayes piece NFL's findings re: aerosols. US make 4 billion wearing mask Seriously understand people vehemently anti-cleaning yourself. Jesus want one, fine, feel like people take offense it. Effective masks widely available since early pandemic. People know care time look efficacy proper masking. 

The reason asking question (answer tl;dr) criminal failure United States Federal Government effectively communicate might difference mask dish towel. 

This going since least March 5, 2020 VP Dr. Birx [completely documents 3M provided team, international mask equivalencies. one first speeches.
 COVID-19 PANDEMIC REPIRATORY white paper dates March 2020, written 3M scientist (Gaert Driessen, usually publishes native Dutch) uniquely English audience. sums masks blunt terms: pandemic circumstances certainly methods masking might less optimal, we're pandemic. Wear N95 equivalent healthcare settings (if they’re available) possible times. 

I'm nearly *positive* exact document presented Coronavirus Task Force. Birx summed wearing healthy person protect you. sick person wearing mask help protect others getting really understanding healthcare providers need masks average American purchasing masks nothing them. sick, wear one.

The Administration even science effective masks, still do:

Immediately FDA gave temporary import authorization KN95 masks, CDC actually implemented testing protocol certify devices met least filtration standard. list available April: [Appendix A: Authorized Imported, Non-NIOSH Approved Respirators Manufactured China (Updated Administrative Changes Respirator Model Removals: October 15, full results available [International Assessment (Respirator) Results – list, updated regularly 10 months.

There even this.

The product almost year anti-mask sentiment Federal Government ends global population know effective mask is, much less find it.

Tl;dr: original response: Legitimate KN95 KF94 masks $12/10pk shipped. available since ~~May~~* April. Black Friday dropped dollar apiece. head federal government want public know this, effectively censored it.

Edit: First available first week April 2020, checked receipt. April closer $2.50/mask dropped rapidly ~$1.00, less bulk. positive- way less flu. 

We also instituted ‘butt rub’—- stand back back people. Reality humans need human contact, lot studies among elderly infants. clients stand back back touching. live alone, getting physical contact actually hard them, don’t want get people sick.  


Be kind- it’s really hard. Wash hands, wear mask, keep social distance... one really needs hug, stand back back let feel alone... that’s important too. call ‘the Covid butt rUN’ makes funny, it’s actually really important friends clients. I’m lucky- family dog, people don’t, feel really alone time it’s hard anyone reach out. some, handshake pat back human human contact, gone. casual encounters bar... different standards/ needs- try reach see feeling alone whatever way feel comfortable- might mean sending hand written note.  


When shut down, made list elderly clients/ single friends would check with- knew someone cared. took minutes day ( working) didn’t feel alone universe.

 It’s also good opportunity grateful people life. - sometimes heartbreaking Florida. One lady checked with, husband broke hip walking dog, crawled elevator apartment get home- literally crawled, get dog home. called ambulance came in, wasn’t able see six weeks. little could her- could call give human talk to. 50 yrs married, able sit partners side? heart broke- got better, okay (the dog ended fucking dying though- ugh!!!). saying, Kind can- helps whole world. people don’t know order groceries delivered Uber- take minutes, help someone can. helps us- don’t (mostly) want kinder world?  


 way decent people bad people- that’s reality. brains put ‘red alert’ anti-social behavior, that’s gets attention. 99% people driving along side traffic responsible considerate, brain highlights one danger- guy cuts off, speeds past, etc.. brains wired identify danger/!out ordinary. ignore people polite pay attention one lady rude one person anomaly, makes dangerous. 

Do experiment, pick drivers customers group daily basi, count number people actively offend vs number normal polite. drive speed limit, don’t cut line, say please thank you- actively observe, make st us basically nice. opinions, aren’t asses.  


Our brains pay attention asses perceived danger- anomaly. think media fucking perception realit. don’t think grand conspiracy- think it’s wiring. Flashy lights get brain attention. Loud voices get brain attention. Vegas works reason/ slot machines/ TVs/ flashy lights. So... acknowledge mitigate overcome wonderful technologies (which also offer us great advantages).  


We figure overcome ‘danger’ response figure better people. haven’t quite done it, I’m pointing problem. respond stuff- try remind am. perfect, ‘better’. instinct ‘perfect’ mantra ‘better’. one friends works OSHA mantra ‘constant improvement’ find helpful. It’s different way thinking fir me. don’t perfect, improving. learned something, found better way, six months ago? Okay then, I’m meeting goal- constant improvement. might seemed great idae yesterday, doesn’t meet needs today- adapt. changes tomorro, adapt. keep things constant - greater good Kind.

Now, mandatory wear one unless exception. anyone else think bunch weenies complaining mental health time? Like believe it’s issue didn’t circle jerk internet came along. Remember wars, cities bombed, streaming music tv world big screens etc... softest people history. Nice get doses take vaccine yet. daughter did. yes, exact vaccine – Sputnik V. saying US government wrong i’m american happy get vaccine soon, i’m saying people countries upset pfizer misdirected, pfizer choice article 9+ age restriction bottom?

Domestic Japanese company managers pressed questions foreigner too, go figure. :v Yeah, February really became clear going soon, possibly Australia still dealing bushfires start 2020. Even then, really hit bad things states started locking down. got 12 billion help that. refused spend it. swear Doug Ford opened bars get new policy ideas.
Guys biggest tool. base full tech workers like easily work home largely risk job loss. someone wake coma shit storm? watched either movie 28 weeks later repressed memory zombies scare ever living shit Same. getting either yeah, dumb.  sure employees working 14 hour days let work home? read ICU stays even days create permanent bodily damage detected life (muscle mass, heart health, lung capacity, etc). Pretty sure always feel effects I'm sure debilitating would be. Anyone wanna chime in? meant make financial utilitarian sense.

Slowing spread irrelevant elderly vaccinated. COVID extremely high mortality rate elderly extremely low mortality rate young people. 100% young people getting COVID nowhere near bad 100% elderly getting COVID.

If goal reduce spread, vaccinated people based average/expected daily interactions: prioritize work retail/hospitals/schools first vaccinate elderly live isolation last.

But that's goal; goal reduce number deaths via vaccinating elderly opening everything becomes popular option w/o negative connotation ""*you want kill grandmas*"".

TIL vaccines proven efficacy phase 3 trials back alley cures now... Fauci also stated openly manipulates number try get public behavior wants. He’s good public health official deeply believes lying public. fair....... necessarily. trials enough data say. Swiss actually announced approving yet think trials show enough info.

The US trial could actually shed light finishes include strict parameters must included (the US diverse population large elderly population. strict trials approve trial hit check marks) may change results additional information. Unfortunately, need unbrainwash young adults. whole ""scare young people staying home"" campaign worked little well... check post history believe me... No, quite opposite, masks normal. speed full normality returns depends speed vaccination. new technology, dude. 😂 sorry!! dyslexia supposed think it? literally nothing previous questions. seem super confused. hear touch stove burns article says best. medical knowledge likely get vaccinated (doctors nurses). least likely include CNAs, janitorial food service working healthcare.

Getting vaccine important step deploying vaccine.  EU botched horribly. aware fact Spongebob attend Oxford, post-cartoon career vaccine development?  J &amp; J vaccine higher efficacy US overall, would guess not. Yeah, ""lucky"" term many would use describe 2020 whole fiasco general, right. imagine virus was, rather primarily targeting elderly (especially elderly comorbidities), killing mostly children? death rate 8% kids? parent two young kids, idea would reacted. Canada didn’t buy US plant? Canada would sites producing.

If anything, amount tp would use otherwise would pay like 6 bidets year, cost effectiveness less impact environment alone makes worth personally. Hysteria misinformation harmful... no? US Israel priority contracts Pfizer. UK priority contract AstraZeneca. Supply makes difference comes speed. countries list aren’t getting nearly many doses delivered yet. previous President created many concerns candidates rushed, might reason FDA taking time next two. 

Or might White House wants let countries shortages Pfizer Moderna get first, like Canada. AZ doesn’t know shit. According Swiss: ""The data currently available point positive decision regarding benefits risks,"" said. regard grammatical errors, see misuse 'you're' response me.  potential problem viral infection? I'm going throw KF94 masks trash moment vaccinated, I'm going put worries behind point year get life. US approve now! Waiting means killing people. Remember [the entire point restrictions prevent **excess** deaths due hospitals avoid pandemic entirely.

Don't let people tell otherwise. people get vaccine better. Every person vaccinated helps everyone else. enough go around. Excellent news! Spain, think time get vaccinated current vaccines dated. Might well become hermit. likely does, data deficient.

Also suspect decision partly risk afford, since pfizer moderna enough cover oldest. can't true measles herd immunity exists countries good vaccination coverage, means people vaccinated (like infants people certain medical conditions) never get infected. doubt true flu either public health messaging young people getting flu shots protect old.
