They fantastically well first wave spring completely put wealthy Western Europe shame. second wave undone that; even higher per capita death rates places like Italy, Spain Brazil. mean implied “no” first one “yes” second one. It’s me. one know severe symptoms either. say people don’t seems statistically low based year experience everyone know personally infrastructure, enough supply. shots, plan get people. Awful.

*slowdown vaccination*

Younger 65 late spring still happen. That’s separate thing. Mass prioritizing elderly medical workers, putting vaccine locations spots aren’t easily accessible elderly might comfortable driving long distances. 

So, it’s less vaccines “how get people there”. problem isn’t active pandemic emergency, freedom implications regarding forcing someone take injection real. That’s theoretical, abused. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Correct me, wrong.

J+J running two clinical trials parallel - one two dose regimens. two dose regimen turns work substantially better, it’s likely regulators switch recommendation administering two doses.

It’s cash grab “trash” design - it’s careful strategy test dosage strategies, doses go twice far there’s isn’t significant efficacy difference. Actually, that’s exact opposite cash grab, since may result fewer second doses sold.   flu mutates fast even vaccine development, years flu vaccine like 50% effective. rate, hospitalizations back previous peaks 60k week two. hopefully continue plummet there, instead long slow burn like before. government comprised morons. aren’t making vaccines? Like nothing India, nations make be, provide can’t. Canada become nation wandering around begging help? Yes, report recently said spring people younger 65 years old would able get shot. question this... can't vacinate kids hidden dangers? Yep, guys made fun us response. Like tools. Europeans honestly fucking deserve made fun getting enough vaccines purchased early. least it’s Americans made fun five minutes. don’t get issue is. They’re getting vaccines people. Mass sucking distribution. here.....

Start worrying Canada meddling India's affairs less. Perfect, 1.5 year old one due April, estimate I’ll quarantine 6-7 years!

I’m joking anxious long take vaccine come infants. otherwise staying home. disease low death rate prob eugenic social Darwinism hoping for. Try validating concerns explaining despite that, vaccines safe, effective, necessary. Nope, guys made fun case count early pandemic. fucked up, got made fun suffered. guys fucked securing enough vaccines. Take ridiculing suffer like did. we’re good here, I’d happy share vaccines. It’s kind hard buddy buddy European right though due way talk average American citizen. ""I would imagine **by time get April**, would call for, know, better wording, open season,"" Fauci said. ""Namely, **virtually everybody anybody category could start get President Joe Biden said Thursday **US track vaccine supply 300 million Americans ""by end July.""**

So it? April July? lol

But better Pfizer's trial children ages 12-15 fully enrolled 2,259 participants. company said hopes results ""in early part 2021 there, plan finalize study 5-11 year Moderna still enrolling participants trial children ages 12-18, plans start studying vaccine even younger children 6 months 11 years ""I would think time get school opening, likely able get people come first grade,"" Fauci told ProPublica.

So good chance middle high school kids get vaccination fall, potential elementary kids bit later. Wow that’s wild. several family members healthcare vaccinated month now. Hope get soon! Serious question, discharged hospital, past point infectiosness? BBQ think voted airlock skeld. I'm vaccinating stupid kids anyone else's. Force needle deep arms, care. I'm kids either way. 

But actually proof kids get covid damage like that? Like permanent long lasting. one yet provided proof, think ghost story First all, calling stupid. Yes, everyone get vaccine. doesn’t mean people still need convinced stupid. (Not counting crazy antivax conspiracy theorists)  Fall 2021 completely board also think virtual option available need it. ways away vaccines available adults.

Some parents responsible things like learning playgroup pods. someone really needs continue fall okay IMO.

I'll reiterate though, get vaccinated choose to, sympathy. kid needs school keeping insane. lmao

&amp;#x200B;

no thanks Death numbers always lagged month behind case numbers. Since we’re month removed case number peak Jan 9, deaths theory start drop like rock sharp decline cases vaccine rollout targeting risk demographics I’m person teacher can’t get vaccine. sure 6 weeks everyone able get one. exactly happen then?  he’s saying contradicting news it’s confusing people don’t know person’s about, got vaccinated free hospital two weeks ago, I’m going second shot tomorrow place. live suburban Philadelphia reference. wanna get da JJ. don’t wanna twice   Factor people dont want honestly we're going lot leftover vaccine. imagine things ready demand Walgreens May, maybe late April. seems kind shitty come take vaccines. you’re talking spares have, yeah sure come over. Canadians coming steal vaccines still need utter bullshit. Stop lying. Together, Pfizer Moderna already agreed provide 400 million doses United States. Biden said doses would delivered sooner anticipated, guaranteeing enough supply end May vaccinate 200 million people two-dose “By time get April, would call . . . ‘open season,’ namely, virtually everybody anybody category could start get vaccinated,” Anthony S. Fauci, nation’s leading infectious-disease expert, said Thursday NBC’s “Today” doses also expected come Johnson &amp; Johnson, submitted application single-shot coronavirus vaccine U.S. regulators earlier month. approved, easy-to-store vaccine would augment supply, although production setbacks expected limit availability spring. It’s also possible vaccine experts may recommend vaccine people certain age groups.


So think three pretty important notes article here...

* end May enough Pfizer Moderna alone vaccinate 200 million US.
* Dr.Fauci says April anyone wants vaccine able get it.
* Additional vaccines expected J&amp;J buff numbers.

Based this, really looks like seeing light end tunnel. Lol 😂 Children Men type shit  Religious exemptions! deleted. 

Make vaccines mandatory 100% time. There’s select people medically cannot get vaccine. family member falls umbrella. One reason I’m adamant it. depend herd immunity survive. 

Measles shit rebounding dipsticks makes blood boil Fear mongering finest Yeah fuck noise lol. end 100% country vaccinated. ends vulnerable vaccinated longer putting hospitals risk overwhelmed, like 1-2 months now, 6. forgot morpheme. It’s vaccines fault lol dad grandparents got first doses can't find second dose anywhere. We're LA. I'll actually take streets start burning shit ground. want see violence? Try keep everyone locked next year save 80 90 year olds. Maybe they're pedantically literal. Like 330M Americans there's enough doses 300M saying *technically* enough everyone? know. Definitely odd, probably reporting errors Ah yes, [fourth stage response waiting turns kind freaky new casual encounters section Well mean give bit time.... *just keep walking*

*you don’t need unnecessarily negative people life* don't. like disease vaccine exists, force society cater toward people choose unvaccinated. really. going 200m July, got pushed May since Biden took office secured 200 more. that’s lot fit headline. 

Warp Speed may helped items iirc Pfizer Moderna scaled testing. Unsure production. Helped older folks get vaccine it’s annoying won’t give rest us SA variant definitely exists Israel probably many fold prevalent know sure. 

If virus spreading still, it’s matter time SA variant becomes dominant Israel too. they’re really delaying inevitable vaccinations Israel. are. key revised special measures legislation passed Diet earlier month take effect Saturday. allow officials fine people businesses break anti-virus rules.  legislation also enable prefectural governors implement anti-infection measures central government declares state emergency.  health ministry expert panel met Thursday discuss infection situations medical care systems Tokyo, Osaka, eight prefectures state emergency effect.  minister Tamura Norihisa said spread virus gradually brought control, enough hospital beds COVID-19 patients.  government likely maintain state emergency 10 prefectures time due shortage hospital beds. Well case yea hear ya. Trust process all.

I flight booked Israel summer (on Delta, though) - I'm starting feel bit optimistic I'll able make trip. Covid never go away, summer weather mass vaccinations, I'm thinking risks pretty low. sure, understand! Happens best us. Hope good Friday weekend! time Canadians vaccinated rest world done. USA hoarding vaccines. It’s mixed bag. would say probably equal. think would've learned mask/PPE shortage.  I’d buckle up, next years, we’re likely hear whole lot went behind scenes Trump White House, whether it’s people writing tell-all books lawsuits. criticising leadership. Canada able make vaccines.

The problem USA hoarding everything like Smaug mountain. Canada forgot mention, I'm assuming bring provincial medical card. Turns actual vaccine manufacturing country biggie. long lasting you? Well fuck, A-Boogie, plenty evidence. multiple cases people struggling get months. Kids included. going circuit breakers reach herd immunity? actually serious question. work out?

This hasn’t destroyed narrative it’s spun politically. They’re allowing restaurants that’s like real difference somehow gets spun “they totally ignore virus there.” Sweden like cases flu year. obvious distancing, limiting social gatherings staying home sick causing drop wearing masks. Thank great reply.

You're wrong distributed production though. Granted, Serum Institute India largest vaccine producer world, IIRC, concentrating supplying developing countries, well providing vaccine India.

The ""problem"" distributed production, different production facilities produce. Specifically Pfizer Moderna's mRNA vaccines use traditional vaccine manufacturing process. One vaccine candidate (Medicago) uses plants produce ""Virus-like particle"" also. several old-school inactivated virus vaccines development well. 

One consideration though possibility licensing. One example, believe Canada, Providence Therapeutics mRNA vaccine production capacity *could* used produce Pfizer Moderna vaccine, isn't.

The  expectation supported American professor Bryce Chackerian  University New Mexico School Medicine, researches  vaccines based similar technology followed work  University Copenhagen closely.

“I  believe vaccine several advantages vaccines  already approved late stages clinical  trials. One indicates vaccine provoke strong response immune system, ”he writes email expectations high effect.

New virus variants South African seem less sensitive antibodies, continues; vaccines simply risk worse, seen Astrazeneca's vaccine South African mutant.

“But produce high levels antibodies, less worrying. potential Copenhagen vaccine better protect new virus strains, ”writes Bryce Chackerian.

Søren  Riis Paludan, professor Department Biomedicine Aarhus  University, also believes Danish vaccine potential.

He seen data experiments monkeys mice, ""it looks promising"", says:

“After  first wave vaccines, ones now,  another wave vaccines targeted new virus  variants; provide better immunity work better weak groups succeed vaccinating now. race, think strong candidate become one best. ”

Two things. 

Firstly, yet shown true AZ one (unless I've missed recent story), main one we're currently using UK. small trials done, nobody got hospitalised, people age risk hospitalisation already low. I'm really hoping true, there's nothing conclusive one way another yet.

Secondly, reducing chance hospitalisation death vaccinated clearly _very_ important, purpose. key purpose vastly reduce spread. That's important reasons. reduces risk vaccinated - going include much world quite time, even (a small chance individual getting seriously ill still fairly major problem macro level long virus still spreading wildly community), reduces risk mutations could evade vaccines.

That's say AZ vaccine useless - clearly not. still cause concern. shit, I'm looking forward total numbers suicides over. You’ll hear it’s important though.

Claims reinfection far valid first infection validated repeat swab serum response. Rare see though. great news. Obviously patient, hope recover fully. 

But many people getting infected, many people already infected, first incidence someone getting reinfected S. African variant, means previous infection provides protection variant, like vaccine.

There lot excess deaths attributed Since beginning pandemic, approximately 50 deaths attributed COVID-19 among Canadians age of 45. Given over 440 more deaths expected among age group reported September November alone, excess deaths cannot attributed directly COVID-19.   mortality among younger age group observed since May affected mostly males. May November, estimated 8,764 deaths reported among Canadians aged 0 to 44 years, excess of 1,691 deaths. Males accounted for 77% excess deaths and, overall, experienced a 25% higher-than-expected number deaths period. mean Curevac almost guaranteed awesome well?

They've averaged 7k week unless drastically increase supply, it'll turn comes. ridiculously slow. sure. admittedly mathematician familiar models spread. However, assume positivity rate states high amount testing true, extrapolate say (for example) places positivity rate 5% have, roughly, 5% entire population infected.

If also assume every 4 weeks new generation completely unique individuals tests positive COVID, 12 months 60% population tested positive.

If assume every 8 weeks new generation completely unique individuals tests positive, that's 30% population.

This seems big weakness 93% statistic. covid roughly 30,000 people year died flu, many infants young children, rest elderly. deaths preventable, however costs preventing higher benefits. Death part life, it’s unfortunate completely misinterpreting “right life” statement wild west knows. Every county things differently, different stores different areas supposed offering vaccines. One (Publix) donated quite bit group backing Desantis, I'm sure coincidence :P  desperately need centralized organization competent. state built unemployment system broken purpose (and Rick Scott gets spread rest you, sorry that...) Read article 3 new drug trials going apparently clear symptoms fast. think problem is, prolonging spread disease everyone, included. Why's that? Covid aside, think he's great shape would probably huffing puffing good bit walking stairs time. hate missionaries even this. go places people hungry make listen fiction book. 1943 Aparently that’s dirty quitter talk.

you’re right though. It’s like keep country limbo get like double digit daily deaths. got opportunity Pfizer vaccine month ago, took it. preference would Johnson &amp; Johnson shot. One shot convenient, still effective hospitalization death. dont think weird exact thing killed parent immediately die? refuse wear mask? refuse socially distance? refuse isolate literally visiting COVID unit watch die?

thats like picking smoking dad dies lung cancer. mean, least wait *few* weeks. pretty shitty example kids ask me.

if people killing thats one thing, work &amp; bullshit &amp; dont see argument  Attempted murder? bad single-dose vaccine. Expect see people know difference. bit rant post, think many people resonate it:

Given sacrifice young people made (education, finances, social gain, working ""essential"" jobs, etc...) particularly bearing non-death consequences pandemic lockdown, deserve resentful older, ruling generations. well, given we'll last line vaccines, despite blamed numerous time virus spread, absolutely think fair young people freely socialize want vulnerable people vaccinated. I'm talking music festivals, college events, bars, kid events, sports, stuff defines youth. And, course, young people angry private gatherings continuously chastised. Maybe generational consciousness, we'd Woodstock style event summer; need deserve, I'm gonna step away fear labeled selfish. really wonder much resentment young people hold, particular affect things politically culturally; we're impotent, digitalized generation nothing comes this. replying comment strategy countries. like native Americans developing immunity smallpox European diseases back day ... think come metric long time ago said, “when reach X situation, get rid masks social distancing.” Rather infinite agnostic wait-and-see approach spin circles wring hands. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

""healthcare provider"" seems vague. doubt data standards trial data was. really presented good news. Field hospitals place nursing home patients. people need lot extra accommodation can't get field hospital. rock/hard place situation. released back homes, hospitals would filled would asking Cuomo release mostly recovered patients. Agreed. exterminate termites house maybe neighbours houses within proximity. go forcing every single home even 20km away exterminate house. Would trust invading force? 

It's like France asking Nazis help WW2. Huh? can’t imagine think that’s actually good point. don’t even know reply ridiculous statement [Article 1995 Oslo agreement reads: ""Powers responsibilities sphere Health West Bank Gaza Strip transferred Palestinian side, including health insurance system.""  interested mild cases. countless long-time issues infection creates? Make sure giving dangerous medical intention without proof. scenario work even caused damage trust vaccines would plummet dangerous level. Good lord. Can’t age done this?

75+, 65+, 55+, etc. 

Age captures people risk (including masses people things like hypertension diabetes don’t know they’re sick) simple way that’s hard argue with. 

This business parsing deserves makes process slow inefficient. also stirs unnecessary resentment people don’t need. Project warp speed used produce vaccines. sure sucks 4.5 million Palestenians get modern Israeli government fucking horrible.  Article 17 1995 Oslo agreement reads: ""Powers responsibilities sphere Health West Bank Gaza Strip transferred Palestinian side, including health insurance system.""



So palestinian authority also trying convince us it. I’m guessing you’re prisons violate declaration human rights? Agreed. Schools opened looooong time ago. 

This problem panic-button shutdowns exit strategy besides “we’ll reopen it’s ‘safe’”. “Safe” vague unquantified. It’ll *never* completely “safe”. 

Meanwhile, secondary effects school shutdowns lost education keep piling kids governments, school administrators, unions keep farting around guidelines safety theater. 

There’s reason school closures previously recommended short-term, last-resort kind measure. It’s close, kids get screwed indefinitely it’s always going struggle reopen. Here's official link According third national serological-survey report Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR), 21 percent population, aged 18 years above, showed evidence past exposure COVID-19. data seroprevalenceamong aged 10-17 found 25.3 percent.

They also said submitted paper Lancet journal, can't find it.  Got source Israel-based? Surely Palestinian officials talk lack reliance Israel, solely Israeli publications. suspect people pushing narrative significant overlap antivaxers. They're trying justify antivax quite way ""bought in"" ""movement"". grasp low hanging fruit ""logic"" - ""why get isnt 100%?"" like. Relevant update: Yes, noted Israel misfortune vax campaign middle massive surge. vaccines blunt surge, numbers look way better hovering near 0. Experts saying along. Covid never eradicated. But, immunity built population longer cause big spikes threaten overwhelm hospitals. Rather, another seasonal respiratory virus like colds flu. added Data above, 12 Million Students 11 Students got infected School, one died check Statistics.

Guess genius, flu vaccine different every year whole point “WhY wOuLd TrUsT sOmEtHiNg tEsTeD TeN mOnThS” also applies flu shot get every year. Isn’t must named said debate? certainly hope not, think figures France pretty stable moment - lower current UK though falling way, still substantially better terms total deaths per capita.

Hold breath ...  gift keeps giving good idea? Diminishing returns. last 20% hardest.

Hell, zero regulation we’d gone 3 million much lower number fear alone. last bit, that’s work Im healthcare worker currently public education setting, got shot moderna week felt like walking sunshine afterwards. got this! arabs israel get go get vaccinated whenever want. 


The oslo accords suggest palestinian authority charge pandemic relief palestine, sentiment palestinian government shares. 


Asking question like asking germany vaccinating french. international airport Jab common UK English. measures place Japanese schools?

The question isn’t it’s theoretically possible safely open schools. question whether US measures instituted followed safely open schools. Somehow seems even worse sounds. Finally, end nightmare  healthy begin facility age. Yes? isn’t small island nation. (Yeah Australia big geographically still half population California.)

Once got beyond dozen cases US, actually likely meant far more. cat bag. That’s western country able stop completely. Even countries like Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Brussels, etc struggling despite strict lockdowns leadership aren’t idiots.

Lockdowns intelligent planning limit deaths, can’t get back zero, virus infectious many asymptomatic vectors. reason Australia Nz able never let get foothold. Seems Trump levels Marcon unpopular tells truth. Anyways, maybe added people, already so, even vaccine. Thats initial trials for. already studied effectiveness blind studies placibo groups. showing well country rolled out. Canada province they’re giving 1st dose healthcare workers even can’t get 2nd one weeks months...then rest population isn’t even getting first :( That's x 24 hrs dose. Really mild tbh Tell gym still closed 9 always packed. Joe Biden expert. experts say 2021 US back normal. fuck would listen Biden experts? even decision. taking guess it. Masks reasonable public health precaution all, get right mask it’s downright convenient honestly

(Obviously I’m going wear it’s longer needed issue it) Yes, initial rollout slow, January much faster. Supply bigger constraint distribution (and fact Pfizer requires extreme cold).

There's plenty criticize Trump admin virus, vaccine approval rollout really one them. Increase distribution steadily going rate before. 

It Biden (who job three weeks now) came gangbusters doubled speed. one expected would dumb think could since there's 'extra' vaccine stored warehouse somewhere. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Common question

Can breastfeeding mothers receive COVID-19 vaccine?

When person gets vaccinated breastfeeding, immune system develops antibodies protect COVID-19. antibodies passed breast milk baby. Newborns vaccinated mothers breastfeed benefit antibodies COVID-19.Jan 28, 2021 effects seems lot worse though longer lasting. lol restaurants grocery stores still forcing masks 2nd half 2021, im going turn full karen berate manager get want get kicked I’ve said tickets rescheduled Billy Joel concert September. bought tickets November 2019 really hope happens. point whether intentional not. EU gets less expected. Lol. coincidence. lightning clearly attracted heavy metals poison ""vaccine"" Australia police state? Take deep breath good hard look stock pile past certain size value less COVID circulating globe value. work like that. can't start working living another country cause want agree entirely. I'm anti-masker btw, think people make big fuss around wearing mask places require bit petty. meant know businesses really care I'll make point shop rather places require it. probably better everyone way anyway. Yeah, that's gonna dawg. ends decide does. Czech republic struck emergency restrictions due public pushback, polands restaurants coordinated mass reopening, etc. 


If mindset ""im really depressed, hope soon"" it'll never end. Gotta get world make change, even small walking outside without mask areas everyone wears them. Imagine trump wasn’t president last year, many lives could’ve saved could’ve much closer normalcy now. I'm saying idiots. pointing selection bias. still leaves 15,000+ non-seatbelt fatalities per year, assuming wearing seatbelt would saved ones. seatbelts nothing ~20% fatalities incurred pedestrians cyclists. know constant activity , state many others , confusion. Canadian friend’s perspective US rolling like clockwork. criticism Doofus Biden , promised “ military precision.” Enough already. Unless vouch nationwide police state martial law next couple years ICE heavily patrolling every border, aren’t really going see covid get zero. whole crisis economic. federal government pays people state local governments could handle vaccines everything e would broke.

$2400 checks monthly solves.

A. unemployment needed.

B. rent mortgage moritotims.

C. businesses going people money spend shut pandemic start back everyone guaranteed income. Lockdowns strict enough ruin people’s livelihoods. everyone may followed T, definitely ruined lives. actually disagree one. Masks fall responsible, data-driven, economically sound ways reduce spread. No. steaming dump mean delivering less 15% promised 2020, among things. robust framework place distribution actual vaccines state holding sites get people's arms. Relying states figure end logistics without robust funding coordination. Pretty much everything. giving vaccines countries.

Y tho?  people Central America come nothing, certainly go nothing.  Compare death toll Florida California, compare populations. Florida awful job.

I blame single state, though. federal fuck up. Punting decisions state level dereliction duty. New York, right? Remember taboo point Cuomo killed people nursing homes?  :) suppose they’re cleaning night? go! vaccine came 1988 Asia vaccine cleared US 1995. barely made cutoff, bit younger you. mom got adult even lost child it. traumatized heard vaccine, one first line.

So 1993 mom wrong vaccine right vaccine available (unless Asia). Yeah 2nd strain (I really hope real, want relive 2020. mental health can't handle anymore) Australia created police state. literally arrested choked woman walking alone outside without mask broke house another one wanted socially distanced masked anti lockdown protest. claim don’t want martial law? Brah. denied israels offer decided go Russian vaccine. also vaccinate people dual citizenship people work israel aka people pay taxes israel  liberal hoax store. posted social media ""wasn't big deal"" get coke instead. denied israels offer decided go Russian vaccine. also vaccinate people dual citizenship people work israel aka people pay taxes israel full shit there's literally zero point people wearing masks vaccinations hit critical mass, estimated june july. Even that, hard ask people see deaths plummet. 


I've pledged support small businesses (and big ones) cut security theater let operations go back normal. Businesses push masks late 2021 see penny me. best way end security theater fund Nothing a-political comes Israel. Palestine free country. wall around dozens checkpoints. strawberries can't come certainly freezing temperture vaccines can't. Besides help sea subsequently bombed (remember red cross ship couple years ago?). Palestine free, Palestinians East Jeruzalem, occupied Israel dont get vaccines. Golan, occupied disputed areas. standpoint, they're good enough build houses work low paying jobs, (strangely cant take part Israeli politics however) part burden take care of. well societal, economic humanitarian burdens occupier inhabitants occupied territory 4th geneva convention. pandemic taught people believe everything all-or-nothing.

Masks prevent COVID, know one person caught wearing mask (likely wearing improperly). ""Masks useless friend caught wears mask""

COVID vaccine 95% effectiveness rate prevents death catch still. ""If still catch it, what's point? Vaccine useless"".

We live stupid world people live absolutes. either 100% works work all, middle. possibly know who's exposed virus? might time start approving vaccines. Oh hell yes! literally welded people houses, something Democratic nation because... yeah. would interpret ""learn live it"" opposite ""restrictions forever"" since know restrictions forever form living I’m worried December comes, continue push goalposts even more. I'll fully vaccinated then, I'm willing follow orders meaningless security theater. Original study: September 2020
Follow study: January 11, 2021

It’s almost like data larger sample sizes able make better determinations. 

This isn’t spreading fear. spreading information. Jesus man science works, idea problem is. 

Have nice day. How? Palestinian Authority refused wanted Sputnik. Israeli army shoot vaccine darts random Palestinians? Something tells angry case too. I've ""heard"" (aka official source all) adverse reaction first dose likely worse second time. anecdotal, happened coworker. got second dose yesterday feeling rough, tired/fatigued/headaches/body aches, sleep well. Taking day I'm sure could work, sick time may well push it. hope better second dose! think mentally preparing worse helping deal this.  first smallpox vaccine developed 1798 didn’t eradicate smallpox 1980. That’s quite vaccinating everyone time! 1 person 40 million vaccinated, several underlying conditions. ridiculous headline is. Fuck coronavirus palestine refused israels help Correlation =/= causation. That's like saying ""'I've jerked every day since 14 gotten malaria"", like okay may factors play here. Way back beginning someone told biking safe bike lanes could ""Covid Superhighways"" mean palestinians refused israeli help? Okay people complaining Israel isn’t helping first offer? guess whatever LAB cooked in, guaranteed 'New normal' 'New variants' coming like new iPhones every 6 months keep terrifying shit people paralyzing thier faculty reason making humanity stupider one news post time. That’s cause they’re God’s chosen ppl. US aid credits buy weapons US manufacturers, blank checks. also represents miniscule portion GDP. Israeli healthcare good merit despite false narrative Israel leeches everything US. always works depending sense humor! Doesn’t draft lot kids enroll option less comes financially stable future they’re almost coerced forced military. government drains resources poor counties ensure that. It’s irresponsible say don’t know situation improve. say “wear masks December” instead it’s better keep masks vaccine widely available everyone, large degree population vaccinated? There's good chance they'll approved younger children well, though certain point especially manufacturers we'll giving vaccines countries. Navy Fed bank account. Wonder one guys active duty. casual googling popped one name least affiliated Army. Look many people died Australia New Zealand. 95% deaths certainly could've prevented. Makes sense. symptom onset everyone. gf showed symptoms exact time. felt like got hit truck thought PMS. reason already quarantine knew exposed. person exposed us knew sick (but COVID) exposed us. I'd never underestimate power stupid people. Think many people wear badge honor ""I flu still came work"" whatnot. I'm really gonna argue cause opinion Israel's budget goes defending Israelis also use money fight groups hurt palastinians Israelis, id rather go conflict giving aid whould barely change anything conflict us economy. It'll probably hurt sides conflict affects even felt america course assume 100% exposed people get infected without vaccine, seem pretty far case. Yep. Time start opening figuring protect vulnerable scaling vaccines. We’re past lockdowns. bars/nightclubs/restaurants/parks? - literally zero chance

I agree - seems like media agrees part too. people can't stand bad news form.

Vaccines greatly exceeded expectations. media reported this. course, throw caution - like fact variants exist may metered efficacy result, might need booster shots (something stated directly companies make vaccines themselves).

One report next good news coming - drops post-holiday spikes vaccine efficacy higher originally anticipated, news Israel half million vaccinated people zero deaths. Yet somehow, media gloom-and-doom people.

Maybe people need read USA Today, color might help them. much lighter economy, too.

I confess never understood combating virus would somehow better economy. earlier ages, smallpox, polio, cholera, diphtheria, measles, leprosy, yellow fewer US. none good economy. Rampant epidemics always associated poor countries generally low standards medicine hygiene reason. see bad news. means vaccine schedule resistant unpredicted changes supply failures deliver part vaccine manufacturers. 

It basically guarantees that, matter what, there's enough states make hard plans around knowledge knowing x amount supply DEFINITELY getting them.  Oh right. would expect number people quite low, especially time marches on. Don’t discount cross reactive immunity. risk hospitalization zero irregardless mutations, problem solved. mention mutation rate Covid -19 quite slow compared viruses. nice error checking function unlike influenza. Therefore doesn’t mutate nearly much dramatically. 

Once infections start dropping amount mutations drop well. agree everyone get vaccinated should, help protect can't. agree there.

I'm sure real life would actually turn minor inconvenience... Also, edited comment above. Broken records. I've argument since beginning. Back every bit convinced now. ""No, we're close enough..."" Fine. way. come find 6 months 12 months say ""I wrong""? one last May has, argued till blue face ""herd immunity growing"". know think gain. think attitude gains us longer virus. know? herd immunity!  places like NYC, demand insane. I'm already sweating thinking pricey tickets vulnerable vaccinated summer based current rollout plan. top this, seasonality, guess largely contributed low case counts last summer despite people really following restrictions.

I'm thinking summer mostly normal, minus road trips US sort thing (but current vaccination rate US, might possible). “The Department currently completing review submitted data expects make decision authorization AstraZeneca vaccine coming days,” Health Canada said statement Jan. trying vilify sub, literally epitome two-bit sub topic COVID. allows news articles posted project author’s personal bias lack scientific understanding time. r/COVID19 better sub, since allows primary sources institutions. Problem - seems effective. Honestly, buy selling. even animal trials this. ""to get sense"" something trust comes personal health. Young people need though. death rate 18 19 year olds? Children risk flu. verbiage literally says ""vaccine refusers"". Refusal implies choice, obviously would vaccine. people lose money, lose patience. eventually turns 'fuck it, whatever happens happens' 'it bunch bullshit' theory lot them. strain (Sars-Cov-2), different variants. always given exposure one variant give resistance another. Fortunately looks like infection original variant gives resistance B117 UK variant. us vaccine looking travel Hawaii, however we’d still 72 hour quarantine. Wondering change anytime soon exemptions vaccine?   would argue would even reduce viral load may expel, breath passing higher humidity threshold becoming heavier would been.  wife poet; please thank me! Appealing teachers' unions many teachers want go back. lot shit say none nice teachers' unions.

My kid school full time since September. work interventional radiology hospital Florida. I'm around numerous literal covid patients every day. also elementary aged kids going large public school, understand concern degree, cdc enough data counties closed counties yolo'd thru covid able recommend schools open despite risks. Realistically schools cant enforce hand washing social distancing. cdc aware well union concerns like poor ventilation fact every teacher vax, still enough outweigh risks keeping kids away person school. reccomendations dont say cant continue virtually concerned btw Israeli numbers testament anything numbers improve. People like wait, people see friends relatives take vaccine accept it.

Furthermore, there's element convenience. vaccination numbers stall Israel one methods work sending vehicles vaccines teams neighborhoods large workplaces. people bother scheduling appointment taking time get vaccinated spare literal 5 mins takes comes them. really think US done enough genetic sequencing variant able tell whether taken over?

Hint:     That's awful them. Brexit going help recovery. One-Two punch. share air people nearest rows. like there's curtain air flow every seat row. circulation good air, ground good all. 

Far, far safest place be. Yea, water content lungs maintain, capability expel mucous such. South Korea, China, Vietnam also large land borders. everyone can’t get vaccinated.

Oh noes, god forbid experience minor inconvenience benefits around you. Seriously? Suck up. doesn’t surprise me. public really showed ass respect masking. believe motive produce then? sounds things Moderna may better idea get choice.  Okay label says 5, suppose Japan paid 5 doses. anything bonus. Would nice, least minimum expectations met. Cite sources, two-bit sub personal rhetoric. never going admit strategy wrong. would recommend take closer look studies. I'm sorry loss. Fuck cancer. gonna like 2pac came prison dropped best album. I'm trying idiot, understand good news president secured another 400 million doses vaccine. current amount Pfizer, Moderna, JJ enough vaccinate 300 million Americans, adult population. able vaccinate additional 200 million non-existent people good, unless idea give vaccines away countries soft-power generosity diplomacy. hedging JJ working, case still feels excessive. Could somebody explain?

EDIT: word hope right good combination policy relatively lucky huge number cases early would make lockdown almost impossible much tinkering may needed, ultimately... recent paper Sinopharm SA variation concludes antibodies generated chinese vaccine effective (somewhat less) mutation. Good news inactive virus vaccines. hope that's reaction too. I'm concerned mental fog issues (from brain inflamation) could set entire generation kids behind. vaccines quite safe big problem might think. read studies? BUNK. wish know reference. also know virus get weaker mutate. again, let miracle immune systems intended for.

Im sure confirmed mRNA vaccines effective studies, I'm sure funded pharma companies. negate fact mRNA vaccines novel immune systems capable handling next ""big scary mutant"" strain live California, following guidelines. Certainly anymore before. guess that's fair, apologize crude comment explain happened SE England then?

Whilst strictest measures England whilst others England, not. That's correct largely meaningless. need everyone vaccinated need 80% 85% people immunity go back full normal assuming immunity lasts stops spread. spread stopped vaccines natural immunity make reinfections much milder, still basically live normal life. main thing matters reduction hospitalizations reductions deaths reductions long hauling. vaccines immunity natural infection (still largely unknown point) largely stop three things quickly go back normal. false-positive PCR nearly impossible.  pharmacy supposed get either state federal week.
State arrived Monday Federal Tuesday.
We added 190 appointments 8 hours pharmacist staff. contrary, think performing arts amazing next year. artists well rested, mentally physically. miss stage, screen, best re-open. Pretty much everywhere world decline are, regardless lockdown lockdown. Eating lunch drinking water without mask...close quarters classroom bus...bad ventilation. Like previous poster said, sounds dandy paper practice. fools cdc Biden Admin naive hell. Medway outlier came growth virus strict restrictions? Hopefully masks school continue beyond school year. bound huge detriment communication social interactions connections. iirc, Pfizer/Biontech themselfs said 6 doses per vial correct even vial's sticker says 5. Also, get 7 vial okay too. never mix vials. enough studies testing neutralizing antibodies well testing young people's immunity natural infection get sense well works. answer people 18 19 years old terms immunity based natural infection 80%. vaccine we're talking 90 95 2-4x effective relative sense  Mine Pfizer. thanks, love learning things. Tezcatlipoca name Aztec god reminded it. Who's first?

I'm saying they're telling us schools safe open can't meet guidelines. sure. seen bandied around getting much vaccine Australia assisting South Pacific nations. stockpile keep ourselves. blocking checks count?  Patience. guess depends Canada. seen near province. 

Edit: record, consider Canadians ""laughing,"" people dicks. defend pedo, rapist, racist, bigoted ex president?   Eh, maybe. almost population lives small number population centers, it’s like equally spread out. That’s promised. Also happened getting first week office?  What's weird first line second one opposite first one's headline
  Biden says enough COVID vaccines end summer vaccinate Americans
 
But 
  President Joe Biden said Thursday U.S. enough supply COVID-19 vaccine end summer inoculate 300 million Americans.
  
Considering Reuters one like literally couple sentences, I'll go AP saying actual study linked article: However, majority individuals whose homotypic neutralization titres modest – including **over 50% convalescent COVID-19 individuals recipients single dose vaccine – heterotypic neutralization dropped negligible levels**. loss cross-neutralization particularly notable B1.351 potential implications vaccine efficacy populations VOC dominates moderate levels antibodies generated results suggest **reformulation vaccines address new variant lineages ought considered indicates seasonal re-vaccination might required virus**. also show **neutralization VOC significantly enhanced second boost findings show clearly **weaker responses generated example natural infection single doses vaccine, provide adequate cross-neutralization.**

My take, need take two dose regimen best effectiveness variants. Annual booster inevitable needs reformulated best effect variants. Previously contracting COVID give proper protection. Oh get it. don’t get defend lyin pedo Joe bamboozled vote. Could be. seem awhile, remind amazing put together record time. need get patients right meow! fucks sake. scientific fact breastmilk contains antibodies! 

However, Breastmilk **NOT CURE COVID**. Unless covid antibodies even without vaccine shown results. explored another avenue dealing covid.

For fucks sake, anyone stupid. 

Antibodies survivors artifically made ones injected sick people many months, certainly noone drinking anyones breastmilk. least United States many people would kill nurse's salary. Millions living poverty here.

It seems entitled say they're terrified thousands grocery store food service employees working unvaccinated dirty cloth masks. nursing home illnesses July 2019, pneumonia’s unknown origin killing 10 elderly patients Virginia Exactly. That’s promised. said $2000 he’s backing saying 1400. stupid enough believe voted that’s you. Also rebuttal didn’t get first week sworn like said would be. much republicans offering? I'd hope masks worn much like underwear. enough least week so, wear once, wash bunch laundry. 

For WFH might wear mask couple times washing need maybe 30 minutes every week two. population density, never big problem first place thought new variants would render vaccine useless? Make mind, “science”. July?! Seriously?! get approved teenagers children, glad extra. Exactly. UK focusing first doses largely ignoring second doses. many people disagree with. provide source fauci addressing mental illness medical perspective please Alright, you, I’m sure know better Maybe Texas...Definitely California. taking sweet time. people isn't, except elderly people preexisting conditions ever heard single mention mental illness Fauci. Saying stressful hard isn’t saying scientific medical impact mental health Yes exactly, please call congressman encourage come plan open schools, person, 5 days week ASAP. people call, likely may take action allow engineers get vaccine first would even harder replace?

Maybe vaccine rollout based income? someone gets paid valuable must be. 

Vaccines go likely hospitalized die covid 19. Sure. Alright I’m sure know better No. absolute WORST lets go ""offered"". don’t kids idiot. companies announced vaccine ready, US, UK, nations jumped ordered 100's millions doses, option buying more, meanwhile EU sat hands waited, believing could force better deal, thats did, waited waited got better deal, realized vaccines made would go nations ordered first, 

This EU tried put restrictions vaccines leaving there, take ""their"" cut first, like showing buy house wanting cheaper someone else buying it, showing 3 months complaining fair, EU starting rollout now, compared UK US complete shitshow. counted suicides another category starting studied called deaths despair would include overdoses, suicides, alcoholism related diseases, things. thought category may helpful way describe human behaviour/action certain (societal) situations. biased create impossible standard would consider sufficient data. actually fairly common logical fallacy called Nirvana fallacy. Good thing PA exact thing, woman made decision working Biden assistant HHS secretary. likely Tanzania. Oh come on. 
1. wrong idea shouldnt concerned abit faulty masks( I'm assuming didnt saying anything Israeli data)
2. sounds like personal vendetta agaisnt doctors. matter paid well- still emotions.
3. Nurses, original article about, get paid well (not matters) exposed risks doctors. 

I know insist argument. Admit fully aware risks leave alone. 450k study yet peer reviewed, hence caution assuming much, we'd like hope best, concrete evidence remain highly skeptical, look dont doubt vaccines effective, ending pandemic, I'm sure, going long battle, likely.  Good  That's totally true!

There least one day 15,000!

But look far we've come! like point positive Reddit fear drone immediately comments going mutate kill efficiently. hate place Trump wrong thing: People scream him, call names. 
Trump right thing: People scream him, call names.

I agree. since there's difference outcome, try right thing then? Acronyms gift curse  Huh. Interesting. figuring vaccine espionage pulled summer.   Illinois also peaked 12,000 per day falling three months now. You’re comparing different points wave. messaging poor. lie beginning screwed us. 

But that. what's name saying wear one want won't. became anti mask perception.  see people wearing mask know something right.  visual reminder normal times. stand that. lead. worry happens. Grocery stores least social distance. Teachers highly/credentialed professionals can't easily replaced. voted ANO ČSSD. rest against. KDU-ČSL proposed 14 days only. Today alone US Vaccinated 170% Canadas total vaccinations... isn’t one. That’s comment saying, there’s study showing it’s safe administer vaccine along reasonable indication may effective providing immunity, means personal threshold. confused people getting flu sucks, life threatening. people getting flu actually life threatening. I'm adopting masks reasonable distancing environments likely encounter people. want wear mask keep distance places like grocery store public transit? like strangers keeping distance public. 

Another great step COVID demonstrated effective staying fuck home sick. asinine habit going work sick, kind weird ""I'm important/dedicated"" attitude leads people show coughing lung up. employer forces go work regardless sick, fuck them. option work remotely use sick time (office workers) go work sick anyways, fuck hard. 

There obviously situations practical take measures reduce risk spreading flu. Concerts, sporting events, large gatherings still going happen. think anyone proposing going perfect, tried little bit flu would greatly diminished. helpful people United States. literally job, they're paid well Odessa Rankin holding clinics open community weeks, now. Saw someone Louisiana plates ahead yesterday I'm boat 2 almost-6yo. I'm ready us protected. No. False. Link studies showing common finding go away fear mongering. asymptomatic reinfection?  fucking what. last comment engaging you. like respectful talk it, awesome, dick. Get life dude mean they're idiots. Nothing convince point. common theme throughout modern history nations underestimating denigrating Russia peril issues hard help aggressive way, even passively, endangering others. I'm sure they're fine man. sub making people paranoid Can't see Also many would removed population died? biased want sufficient data coming meaningful conclusion?  Show studies regarding long term safety. guys defend rushed vaccine kids like idiots defending Bible fairy tales Uh, work hospital, eligible. What's outrage? think issue getting enough healthcare workers, really easy fix short term. Approaching problem caution known fear mongering. Theres undo button fact, getting first place best way avoid potential long term issues remain unknown wait catch up. make fucking it. lack transparency meting bits important data undermined ability recognize scope severity what’s going on,” said Richard Mollot, executive director Long Term Care Community Coalition, residents advocacy group. New York Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker told lawmakers letter week state started working November establish COVID-only nursing homes “persistently positive” patients coming hospitals. flurry new disclosures began last month state Attorney General Letitia James, fellow Democrat issued blistering report accusing administration underreporting long-term care deaths 50%. No. making choice people kids around. care enough kids get immunized mean people's children teachers exposed diseases. selfish way look it. Thanks nice person internet :) Let know anything said wrong. care lot! think know time comes us decide. Also, pediatricians help interpret studies come out. trust advocate what's best kids &amp; voice concerns might have. see parties voted somewhere? Nope didn’t claim that. said evidence time completely different statement. mostly given people fundamental impact field study typically decades original discovery impact adequately assessed. basically yo true breakthrough that's stood test time passing fad.

Very rarely work done companies fit description. rare exceptions much work done Bell Labs -- rare set company gave scientists lot leeway let stuff tried commercialize came out. rare days-- almost exclusively academics win nobel prizes modern era. exact study less say less country, literally said bigger one

You keep saying America larger country. Re-read wrote need to. think means? country certain size? That's conceited view considering half world's population live countries larger typical European country. big headed keep claiming America larger country. say European countries small called states instead? don't, cause I'm asshole. country insists called country, country. That's it. gave better way phrasing intended, keep sticking idea America country cause pretty much whole continent like USA is

No we're not. Canada Mexico take large chunk know called country, can't thought country.

How mad would someone told country small called state instead? maybe even city.

EDIT: again, CHANGE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ANNOYED say something like ""You can't compare USA ___ USA larger population. instead compare USA EU whole accurate comparison"". say ""The USA country; large"" fucking country. Yes exactly! number one concern. reason care husband getting vaccinated want us catch somewhere bring home them. Coronavirus? say people get tested become hospitalized typically choice. seeing LOT reinfections US, also places variants dominant. Honestly, it’s great news everyone. sooner vaccines paid manufactured, sooner world return normal work still done get sick means work really hard get dinged means restrictions end goverment hard time establishing new ones cant use shorther paths specially appointed commities. (In words going bad) best educate people, beyond do? time less less people holdouts want get back lives. played virus big deal, got it, could wrong. Except NYT. never thought I’d say nyt deserves lot credit approach. Hope change Exactly 💯💯💯 kinda needed UK variants worrying us. First, Derek Lowe’s blog favorite source information. post discusses topic length. Short answer yes, 50-70%. post gets science-y shit don’t fully always grasp. it’s kind intuitive: people got Covid retain immunity many months, vaccines result immune response even better natural immunity, vaccine immunity retained long longer natural immunity. Consequently: sure okay skip day, deadline moving. 🍻🍻 Let’s honest, 4th July gonna rager. think overall US great providing vaccines, great many places prioritizing elderly compromised. want waste doses, hell, mom's entire circle friends 75 none able get vaccinated yet. Front line workers definitely need vaccine, seems there's many medical never even interact COVID patients prioritized well.  Yes agree **mostly** endanger them. dont agree somebody saying ""thats problem"" actions can/do affect people I’m sorry! MCAS ruled 6 month bout hives. fun all. I’m glad daughter okay time. It’s likely age it, whatever causing it! He's awful leader. admitted twice fibbing get people wants.   Sauce? Yes, finish supper. Bad bookkeeping. Poorly structured reporting systems. I've seen happen systems lot things. Hell, multiple services involved possibilities bad counting goes way up.

add people trying go quickly possible things goes even more. mostly endanger themselves. anti vaxxers already gotten Covid level natural immunity. think, honest condition, maybe followers would’ve taken seriously December/ January peak may bad. Legally, yes, lot people (and doctors) contracts bylaws explicitly state discipline termination processes. company follow those, sued breach contract, even person fired company said did. often see people ""suspended pending investigation"" something terrible public. Thanks. severe allergies (Mast cell activation syndrome) empathise miserable is. She’s okay 95% time. every often she’s miserable. She’s tiny trooper though. sister fine thankfully. point fairly early study long term effects still study. thought interesting good baseline guys. work tech company desk job obviously don’t deserve vaccine elderly people.

I don’t think hospital people work desks deserve first either. don’t blame taking it. I'm bit confused this. last heard, EU wanted know vaccines leaving EU, rejecting/allowing transport.

Of course always implied, last heard Von Der Leyen screwed EU response pandemic resulting threatening war Island Ireland.

But article says they've authorised transport vaccines, even though said monitoring left didn't. missed something official, EU bullsh1t again?  Wow really? state in? California they’ve really good vaccinating anyone remotely healthcare Exactly. baby, two school age kids. one understands I'm worried catching Covid. I've tried hard explain lots viruses, including measles chicken pox, reactivate later cause issues. mention potential permanent damage heart, lungs, kidneys. hear ""kids get sick this"". drives crazy! opportunity arises vaccine clinical trial, I'll enrolling ASAP. belittle fear I'd venture guess children riding vehicles far dangerous covid19.  started last year, we'd entire cohort year program already. honestly agree even though took advantage offered feel bad whatsoever. ideal plan would starting covid facing staff, changing quarantine requirements, jumping risk.

But technically included within CDC's definition ""healthcare personell"" complications lie. feel bad hospitals singled Can't believe people vote honest question. great. hope vaccine timid eventually jump board. Lol ok comrade school districts choice given online person 30% average parents opted person. clearly majority parents want protect children covid-19  VACCINES REDUCE TRANSMISSION

Has proven? shots first came still air. suspect maybe enough evidence first rounds proven effective preventing spread? Exactly. vaccines prevent infection. Reduced viral load thing contagious. lot written medical journals, need read more. first 400 million secured last administration. Biden secured additional 200. Misleading title. goddess?? Lmao

Fair enough, still better Mitch offering whatever shit given last year Today’s US numbers. Deaths little higher lately cases saw bit uptick too, hospitalizations continue decline. still getting lag deaths? feel free stay inside rest life pull kids school. long don’t try force zero-risk fantasy rest us. signed 3/4 kids trial (I think moderna? find soon). 4th one excluded since covid. I’m doubtful that. current rate (it go up) we’d vaccinate 70% like July 25th. Also anyone thinks 75% adults get kidding It’s okay, understand it’s stressful child ill. three kids — youngest multiple food allergies. get it. hope feels better soon. &lt;3 Kids died plenty reasons COVID existed. flu example much, much dangerous children COVID. Lmao hope enjoy nanny state ..... Sorry. bit frustrated bunch Covid deniers questioning things. Apologies. Lmfao can't even get teachers vaccinated march. Needles arms kids late next year ar earliest accurate term would ""patient deaths"" ""fatalities"". 660 number explicitly talking deaths, ""patients"" alone specific enough. ""Victims"" poor word choice though. available Prime? pretty similar normal we're required dedicate minutes day trolling Americans Europeans social media. Huh? didn’t say Periodic Fever Syndrome, assume “know everything.” suggested look PFS since way fevers cycling would fit that. meant helpful suggestion, expressed frustration concern child, lot people don’t know fever syndromes. Yes, people behavior prove. Thing thoufh hospitals also deal things like patients coming emergencies check ups etc general things hospitals do. mass vaccination site put resources vaccinating people hospital can't allocate resources vaccines. Plus easier terms delivering supply. Quicker get bunch vaccines delivered one mass vaccination site rather say 100 small vaccination sites. low quality information guy. Claims mutant type changes seen South Africa impact vaccine efficacy, also claims incredible increase transmission / virulence. 

3x virus already incredible, approaching measles territory. 

I'll wait real papers. Personal opinion: got lucky first wave vulnerable second wave since hardly one immunity already it. one scariest things me. get doesn’t go away long term damage. didn’t realize that, that’s little messed Lol unemployed 6 months went back old job October. started notice toe nail turning like dark blue/purple idea why. 

I figured maybe pressure steel toed shoes, knows maybe it’s cancer! went dermatologist asking questions told started soon started working again, weird worked didn’t happen. 

“Well, gain weight since then?” 

“Oh..........”

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* realize worked literally everywhere right? research pretty definitive, don’t seem willing change mind matter says. keep saying there’s lot research proves right actually cited it. Also physician necessarily make uniquely qualified evaluate overall risk/benefit balance keeping kids school. many many different specialties unless researcher specializes pediatric Covid, healthcare policy, education policy don’t think experience “seeing patients” really equivalent peer-review studies. wish children best (no sarcasm). 😂 3 times contagious would infected anyone Yeah get point. They're correct technicality, intention cast fear doubt vaccines entirely; there's respectable medical professional saying ""oh watch out, mRNA vaccine may give people long term problems months years now!"" I've seen, that's dismissed virtually impossible.

Also fact evidence growing shows vaccines greatly reduce spread covid another reason dangerous tell young healthy people get vaccine. helps slow eliminate spread, seems wrong medical professional discourage people getting leading example getting themselves. Especially patients, jesus lol Thanks. seem struck cord COVID deniers. Last time talked Covid father law died (he daughter caught similar times)someone sent message saying glad died. feel you. I’ve working retail since March. I’m desensitized risk catching covid point Prevalence really correct term, attack rate.

30% attack rate common, would give non-escape variants something like -30% R values. Also would mean countries vaccinate people Chinese ones since didnt sumbit data review. places didnt aprove vaccine let people already vaccinted respective countries. bunch crap. healthcare professional, I’m still able receive one.  Covid likes this!

More seriously, depending variants interact vaccines (and prior infections), risk reduction likely lean towards gradual relaxation restrictions. goddess AOC upset broken promise. Trump sicker...physically mentally 😃 Society determines restrictions end guess pandemic. pandemic defined disease prevelent worldwide large area. example even restrictions eased necessarily mean pandemic situation alot safer particular country eased. pandemic likely globally till next year since cases still spreading rapidly number countries especially poorer ones. course countries covid much control long then. US, Uk Israel likely covid control Summer Israel probably March/April. whilst restrictions eased coming months pandemic technically still going much threat major concern country vaccinated population They're endless people obeying them. could ended 4 weeks people fuckin dumb. thanks Well, knowing us, they’ll sold face value and/or traded debt allies. It’s best interest USA healthy neighbors well. Improving outlook Latin America go long ways She’s blood tests testing. ruled things out. read 5 sentences assume know everything. Like chat doctor phone. No. That’s works. Two dose vaccines article said ""April"". 

Did say, year. Totally understand. They’re tech savvy enough that, don’t get contacted they’re screwed.  imagine compromised and/or alone seniors (poorly, imagine.) Yes, experts ever done us?? I’m sorry say this?

I went website real quick found this:

“Whether symptoms, infected people contagious virus spread people.”

So....? info don’t I’d love see it. ""Aw Crap! vaccine rolled people turning attention stuff. Damn!""

""Psssst. Hey boss, check out: called VARIANT reaaaaaly WORRYING.""

""Hot damn Johnson genius! Run it!"" weeks ago. Still defence think is. Hope you’re defender attorney, you’re clients would toast! told vaccine asked made stay chicken pox'd friend weekend. would awesome, hope happens. CVS opened appointments state happy addition, even get relatively doses first Fuck Yes!!!! love you, man.   Much ado nothing. 

Pfizer deliveries back schedule AZ doses confiscate. not? 100% parents. want see grandchildren “more anything world” can’t stay home. even choose kitchen remodeled covid. What. The. Hell. let go problem. see grandkids anytime follow rules. choose to. Clearly isn’t important like dramatize. “But wear mask go run errands everywhere workers around”. Nope. First time life set boundary, stood it, refused guilted it. would cool was, instead, something like anti-fine. whatever want, someone wearing mask flu season, small chance winning small monetary reward, i.e. opposite fine. puts small lottery pool. Something like that.

That way, inhibit anyone's freedom. also could easily pay using medical cost savings reduced flu cases. Maybe person hasn’t seen it. shouldn’t skewer someone knowing something wanting learn November. bit late. Why? pretty obvious China hiding something loaded steroids may caused increased aggression. chasing virus dont vaccinate masses around time frame (we failed already) see vaccines applying selection pressure currently circulating variants....leading variants....requiring new vaccines.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Canada get guys? Please? Pretty much; I'd get authorities involved get COVID employer like it. username says, 3 kids, 10, need sanity, work. can’t show everything David \*200%  authoritarian history government? I'm NZ, seen it. clinical trial anymore.

And I’m stupid take vaccine right still participating clinical trial. think you’re stupid, taking vaccine, brainwashed propaganda think I’m stupid wanting take vaccine FDA approved wanting participate clinical trial disease hardly affects me... first doses population two times bigger. Same. I’m super active psychotic immune system. knew got I’d fucked. spent since last March basically bubble. Aside working hospital. Getting vaccinated created huge relief me. basically dropping fatality levels average flu mortality? W00TW00T One reasons /s Bullshit. exactly different you?  mean, haven’t gone two dose thing 5 million times? 2nd dose today Pfizer vaccine. know too! actually think sort joke? Well, certainly benefits, obviously perfect. think lot Canadians insecure taking care vulnerable populations, terms healthcare (or least attempting to), point pride. rings bit hollow though, like Americans beating chests freedom. Nationalistic pride silly, especially things we're often proud flawed. two pennies.  Small risk death, yeah, want lose sense smell even week avoid it. take doom gloom ~~media~~ reality 2 mil. Vax today? Woah! Yeah, well pandemic whittled focus things matter turns things matter freedom travel, spend time friends. hell Probably much, all. # Summary

* El-Al Airlines Israel announced 100% public facing personnel vaccinated (flight attendants, pilots, security personnel employees contact public)
* vaccination mandatory employees complied received two doses Pfizer vaccine
* Etihad Airways UAE also announced air crew personnel vaccinated 
* Etihad employees received Sinopharm vaccine (one Chinese vaccines administered UAE) tracking app smartphones reads QR codes printed displayed entrance stores. compulsory display code compulsory scan in. Thanks. There's way anti-mask science deniers sub used be, getting sad. 

It's often bad arguments saw 8+ months ago. Erroneous comparisons viruses, misrepresentation statistics, data taken context, empty statements without data used incorrectly... part things bad. Massive proliferation misinformation deceptive statistics. Celltrion made I'm parent I'm worried older people family daughter comes this. first priority life I'm concerned things could impact life covid. far science affects kids given cause concern well 6 year old who's good health Yeah, lot maybes really long time.

In order answer question ""can people vaccinated spread virus?"" scientifically, would require ""challenge study"" people deliberately exposed virus see transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns exposure rules basically never break say can't studies humans.

So monkeys results look good. Links megacomment. You’re stupid it’s hardly different you’re citing. Numbers bureaucratic red tape minimized / fast tracked. 

It’s clinical trial anymore. It’s also technology that’s around 20 years (mRNA) Adenovirus vaccines history starting 50s think. either way feel good it. 

The lipid mRNA vaccines allergic reactions concerned thankfully that’s something 99.9% people need concerned with. Might take longer that. bad reaction shingles vaccine month ago, nearly 24 hours felt sick. that, normal pain injection site. bad. start looking genderless too. response totally baffles me. “a socially accepted role young women”. 1950? Excellent! Happy wrong! It’s incredibly good news, actually. Maybe fairly small island nation middle south Pacific. People. edited, thanks.  modestly chemistry-interested people read guy's ""things work with"" series. great. case Americans. last year. It’s big reason got healthcare. Fuck working sick. offense, sounds really ignorant.  depends variants. Many people, included delay vaccination get best variant compatible vaccine. really think border open year.

10 months know lot variants know now. guess border open, sometime first half 2022. J&amp;J south africa trial variants emerged mrna vaccines didn't. They're effective new strains think calling one ""better"" really make sense mrna trials held today likely gotten 95% efficacy. They're 100% effective hospitalization well. Also JJ single dose easier store also factored in. People asked scan stores etc, I'd say 5% are.

Meaning?  live pretty rural community we're vaccinating regular citizens now.  don’t already??? bad days use around 10-15 Bullshit.  Dint trip chocolate chip, gonna wipe flu mRNA. Hang tight cookie. IIRC little 70% people US open getting vaccine “4 660 patients” doesn’t accurately describe article trying communicate. don’t think many people struggling verbiage. Take military, would one less gold plated toilet. foolishly thought would get semi-thoughtful response, instead...just bargain-bin trolling. Carry on. Seems like we're track IMO. I'm aware anything hampering growth distribution rate, rate growing constantly ~.5M per every week. Here's prediction: 2M per day weekly average end February. even 100% citizens willing approved still need 700M thanks 1-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson.

Given we’ve pass trillion dollar deals playing catch don’t know point we’ll need boosters, low cost prepared. $8 billion sounds like lot grand scheme things, it’s relatively low. OK. Cool rant, bro.

UK AZ, US Pfizer moderna jnj potentially Novavax although Novavax used much US think. likely first dibs Canada Mexico. wonder ever vaccinate children. Australia high priority vaccine supply, makes sense. (Unlike countries vaccine tool left curb huge infection numbers). 

A 5 day lockdown fart wind compared 2020. 
Get done with. 
 
This UK flavour virus fuck though, thanks.  April year? LOL. Using napkin math, end April vaccinated maybe 25% population. still generally available point whoever wants one, that's still probably phase 1B. epidemiologist Florida man? Lol what’s conspiracy? Everything stated factual apart opinion specified We’re gonna hit covid many moderna vaccines beg Pfizer yeah probably happen natural immunity vaccine. course gotten virus get vaccine better immunity Compared virus. That's generally recommended people covid get vaccine. Study issued Novavax also suggested order prevent giving virus someone else need vaccine. Stop international travel Goodbye thot 4/5 would willing take vaccine.

Polls skewed right answer. 50% 1A opted out. Hell 38% nursing home staff took along 80% residents. surplus vaccine come April. It’s licensed. thought want US much control them. Finally good decision making government. need waste vaccine doses. Maybe actually vaccinate super spreaders. TAKE COVID SHIT. Yeah I've following rollout daily family, I've never heard lottery. possible system smaller hospital, can't imagine beyond didn’t evidence either way. scientists sure would, since isn’t vaccine existence doesn’t, everything know one works suggest would somewhat. short, meaningful effect spread, scientists would confused think risk rich people would gain access. People work home dont need vaccine. goal target medical staff, sanitation staff (janitors, etc- poorest high risk), teachers. Then, release public.

It going super slow though coz attendance around 50-60%. abysmal weekends. low mortality rate India people taking lightly. family members got virus, nothing happened them, others start treating like normal fever too. worried vaccination rate pick up, might mutate dangerous strain. 1.4 million people died tuberculosis 2019 change world one's motivated lol. night vaccine appointments open I'm going it. Every night get one.

Maybe years becomes part mandatory vaccine regimen. to. Nobody would make this. would reward people choose it. nobody would get mad didn't. harm here? like look people wearing masks? cares? worth saving lives money see ugly masks people choose wear without coerced anybody? absolutely reason outdoor activities. That's insanity I'm incredibly strict family. go beach times year busy. certainly find hikes busy. spread outdoor minimal, especially masked keep distance.

You realistic. think risk population India simply low. Fewer people 70, 40% population 30. almost obese people comparatively, nothing like west.

Even vaccine targets, govt intends meet risk population first, doctors estimates, quite low.

But dont buy herd immunity, TBH. think possible died severe lockdown smaller towns. larger towns still cases. entry restrictions people fly abroad still, still little safer. You: still there’s kids die per year compared covid.

Also you: hate brought covid vs flu deaths kids year covid major contributor premature death kids US 2020 flu doesn’t kill kids somehow get kids flu shot. one right stay hospital long like unless hospital lets them. hospital says ""you go home"" nursing homes tried make patients return home. Cuomo made nursing homes refuse take patients back grounds COVID people essentially would thrown street stuck hotel 0 personal care. original idea, it? Reduce hospital burden, reduce deaths vaccination. Full stop. it. must end. 

I hope right it. ahead UK? don’t understand many people kind therapeutic. 

And it’s “idiotic” suggest could effective therapeutics, without piles piles “evidence”.

But “vaccine” - tested months, years, stated effect transmission, limit extreme symptoms, unknown long term effects - courageously accepted. doesn’t pass smell test. Possibly OSHA nothing else. It’s exposure sort won’t like it. They’re really stringent masks I’ve read, seems like naturally follows. could slipped cracks, part wouldn’t still contagious. people longer infectious 10 days symptom onset. average time onset symptoms hospitalization 10-12 days.  don’t want incentivize everyone wear masks flu season. everyone wants new normal. bigger news?

Exactly. get it. Also rather cheap medication. terms vaccine itself? knew would taking vaccine second started development risks outweighed benefits vastly me. shot painless, one least painful vaccines. even feel liquid going lol. reaction first dose whatsoever aside sore arm, almost everyone gets. weird sore feeling like, bumped wall super hard haha goes away fast.

The second dose experience sore arm, immediate reaction. immune response later night, totally normal actually happy did, know working job. that's common non-life threatening kept reminding that. take day following second shot, pop tylenol, hydrate, check temp, fully protected 2 weeks date.

If specific questions try help answer those! Yes, wearing masks staying home sick becomes accepted norm. first know wearing mask next year save lives — significant numbers lives. shameful Pfizer vaccines combined diluent prior administration moderna ‘pre-diluted.’ accounts difference ml. time make booster isn’t long doesn’t require new trials. Pfizer/Moderna’s booster ready start summer likely. really. Flu kills many people year, makes sense put restrictions Fall/Winter seems like particularly bad strain year. Lol, bull. even answer. even article lmao. live blog. read it? don’t believe one. dude sources. Homeschooled year suuuuuuuucks nothing else them. weren’t going keep ICU weren’t danger didn’t yet realize bad thing is.

And even know, what? Hospitals aren’t quarantine centers. aren’t set that. supposed get 400,000 doses starting next week? Come CNN, late game. free even insurance. Many (maybe all?) places option select insurance government pay it. 

If see open appointment would jump it. No, people turning up. attendance 50% average across states. govt target 14M now. vaccines people showing Coronavirus weirdly kill many people India. So, many people taking lightly now.

Anyway, risk population india low. obese, older people. Hey buddy sources? expanding capacity too, exponential growth exponential. enough prevent collapse, even enough doctors many people tine. mom works health got really sick like two weeks month lockdowns happened US. asthma trouble breathing normal. Anyways, using inhaler *a lot* thinks may Covid, makes sense still bad cough like two months.  United States? Yes. good news everyday. Don’t let negative news fool you. make money fear :) read article would know answer bull suposition. Weak leadership part problem defining factor. thing nations handled well high state capacity. State capacity, put simply, basically ability state get shit done. leaders say policy bureaucracy figures way get done.

Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore Vietnam different government types, different cultures handled differently made plan executed competently. 

It definitely hidden immunity. majority populations New Zealand Australia European decent. Australia even significant Italian population look happened there. heard Canada bought 3x amount need CDC says 10 days symptom onset. 255 million adults US, would make 510m doses cover. Unless vaccine gets approved teens. stonks stop going sideways Congrats man🍾🍾. actually second shot scheduled exactly one month I'm moon. seems like every day inch towards achieving normality. I’d think children would least get different dose? sure that. 

For adults wondered flu COVID vaccines work say 400lb person vs 100lb person. heavier person get less effectiveness? lighter person apt side effects? Maybe that’s works immune response? Exactly. LA shut vaccine centers due lack vaccine. Would anyone even know name 99% doctors health officials COVID protections? absolutely grasping 15 minutes fame. extreme be, clicks get. doubt believe half shit they're saying helps you’re isolated island J&amp;J hasn’t approved countries yet. don’t throw away existing doses new ones don’t even exist yet. I’d rather spend tax dollars that. fine NZ.  hope get point 75% population vaccinated. 75% normalcy, think that's good benchmark. Sadly Canada rely ""outside"" media relay world utter failure Prime Minster procuring vaccines Canada. tonight we're [slipping global rankings vaccinations, getting worse day end sight. Yeah definitely! protection someone without vaccine still 100% protected ever see story someone getting covid getting vaccine, usually doses people let guard thinking they're safe so, careful! 

We've done entire year, people waiting lot longer theirs, we're lucky ones, wait part. I'm post 2nd shot itching ""go"" already haha diluted? so? buying would supporting death citizens? count days behind. think ""opportunity"" large amount motivated people small number appointments. Still, that's light-years ahead expected last spring. I's say it'll certain July, probably sooner especially motivated. Must Trump’s fault! superiority complex . say thank since good take vaccines ""third world""  . guess entitled people always live bubble amazing much I've hear Dave Portnoy shit state handling pandemic say damn thing (random). least people willing say ""we better"" vaccine supposed ""free"", would assume so. may get county though local pharmacy networks instead insurer though. that’s game changing. dad bring anything vaccination site like insurance card anything ?

Sshhhhh I'm denier. COVID real. Based post history, hate America. seek help vitriol. wonder Australia's strategy snap lockdowns herd immunity. so, good luck. happen know Sinovac one? That's one they're live. husband got I'll probably get one too. Naturally focus directed towards 4 Efficacy 90+% high vaccine world, probably due use mRNA induce immunity. countries store vaccines -60 -80C . Vaccines stored regular temps (2 6C) answer majority countries world.
60-70% efficacy nothing laugh at, easier cheaper produce, easier transport store. odds exposed low impossible. secondary attack rate roommate's friend roommate, you, pretty low. done Portland well. criticising outed third world nation 

Here thought english main language Canada . 

We 1.4 billion humans love called third world superior Canadian point us comparison enough look part. 


Imagine thick. dare remove post. flex them? California massive vaccine shortages moment. shut several sites, hospitals basically told people stop requesting them.


This u?

You made statement right? else anyone supposed think reading that, part CA system? Exactly. I’m saying still talking Trump presidency one strangest moments American history. think we’re still processing happened. [tragedy situation. I'm people free, staunchly defend rights swing arms around, becomes problem hit people arms.

Refusing vaccine case endangers around them. endangering themselves, sure, let them. refusing endangers others, including (like 4 year old) can't get vaccine.

It could work could contained, punishment safety precaution. EU exporting it. think USA correct exporting. want EU also note export.

Canada needs learn build facilities. every developed nation block countries like EU. never allowed happen again. turn tables canada better position India ?Is rich criterion ?

If Saudi Arabia asks India help . Saudi 20x richer tall like that. 

All see hidden casual racism ? India vaccine capital world . buy good India vaccine ? told California going lottery system?

Pretty sure said that. wrote told today put lottery. don’t get it,
I’m pro lockdown anti-summary-executions. 

And apparently that’s rare opinion. stuff saying though, see that? gone, thots! think he’s saying COVID affected older people way, numbers affected younger people, wouldn’t shut world down. 

Which seems fair, severe illness death rate among 20-30 year olds extremely low. 80 year olds outcomes, COVID would barely worse flu. submission linking nypost.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Not peer reviewed yet, promising far. looks like pfizer moderna best vaccines available right now. figured long vaccine keep somebody protected? redose people without issues? told California going lottery system?

But source LA. 

Is LA whole state? understand American egos issue. site reveals daily, hourly, minute. Oh look, lazy journalism.  Canada end supply disruption caused Belgium plant upgrade.  result, Canada's vaccination rate plummet past 3 weeks.  however, something confirmed Pfizer, set recieve 400k doses next 4 weeks due make target 6 million vaccines Moderna Pfizer combined Q1.  While, yes, US even UK numbers, comparable numbers EU countries produce Pfizer.  numbers continue get better Spring.

And noteably, even without vaccinations, Covid numbers dropping drastically.  government made secret, like story suggests.  got hit hard Pfizer supply disruption (you surmise went every country supposed see 50% reduction 3-4 weeks EU seeing 10-12% reduction 2 weeks Canada, Mexico countries outside US/EU seeing much larger reduction ""IOU March"" matter 24 hours -- hint, look EU threatened AstraZeneca delays)

Either way, case counts plummeting, restrictions starting lift, we'll start seeing vaccination campaign get back track soon. keep doomsaying. sensationalized. posting told. 
Maybe stop dick it? also stored much lower temps moderna one. pain ass deal with, prefer administering moderna vaccine. really really **really** fucking hate notion can’t talk mental implications **a worldwide trauma** without presumed Republican.

I’m pro lockdown. I’m pro mask. I’m pro vaccine. need there’s way around it. Shit, need more.

I’ve still contemplated life times last year previous decade combined. I’ve dabbled drinking much even smoking, makes zero logical sense HR 120 days end don’t care slows long slows.

I haven’t heard friends voices year more. don’t see family anymore. Thousands people day dying. Half country psychopaths don’t *care* die. pandemic work

But hellscape sub talk anything’s everyone assumes I’m fucking antimasker. every post hope dozen miserable commenters seem goal convince everyone around hope nothing ever get better.

But sometimes get work home, picked hobby, according best year fucking life. Coronaviruses plus-strand RNA viruses, DNA viruses retroviruses, way ""go dormant."" Chickenpox herpes related (chickenpox herpesvirus), viral genome actually stays permanently host cells (some viruses insert genes permanently cells' DNA). Whenever immune system lets guard down, virus reemerges (that's stress, illness, bad diet, old age, immune system weakeners common triggers shingles herpes outbreaks). possible COVID go dormant years - literally right type virus. [Here's open-access intro-level virology outlines basics viruses work.

And yes, mandating social distancing would imposition freedom would it. It’s small gain flu. like can't call Pfizer. So, talking whole state really information one part California. 

Maybe, maybe, instead making sensationalized comments, post truth saying, ""in area what's going on."" Unfortunately no. means, even lockdown vaccinations, Israel would still 40deaths/day. figure account community transmission reduction good portion population vaccinated. 2018 Israel topped 127 flu deaths year. EVERY doctor’s office long remember pamphlets signs telling people wear masks flu season get flu shot every year. People die don’t listen either. ""makes sense,"" one even raise idea now?

There good reasons before, there're reasons now. Moderna? hope so, vaccine kicking ass right now. Haven’t felt sick years  policy would stupid hazmat one would willing wear hazmat. 

How going naked harm people? gross? people grossed see deformed people, deformed people harming others going public Entering social situations places certain amount risk upon individual regardless illness going around given time.

Yup. It’s would never wear mask flu season policy enacted. barely even care COVID right now. bare minimum regard Covid. don’t care risk personally. others.

But save tax money lives saved PEOPLE choosing wear mask? fuck would ever bother me? different someone choosing get face tattoo nose piercing perspective? existing crew member &amp; someone gotten first shot, mean me? late get pay mention get back paid? anyone know? There's particular reason airplaines *the* place masks except optics. Yeah catch virus one air completely recycled every minutes. People wear masks fly rest lives. That's one have. That's good hear. private gym go opened June 1st 2020 single person wearing masks. held event August 100 people, still cases time.

I've 4-6 times week since good chunk people overweight. We've maybe 8 cases everyone recovered absolutely 0 issue.

I live alone, get tested every Friday case see girlfriend's family Sunday. got two weeks ago. 

Honestly, see danger, girlfriend works ER hear daily, point, agree /u/Hivesql, difficult feeling scared. Sure, could die tomorrow I'm unlucky, possibly get long term effect, it. friends seen person since 2019 covid recently, severely overweight still nothing. He's concerned kidney stone loss taste. kill first post email got hospital time. you’re child abuser. mean Moderna vaccine likely also provides strong response variants? like fish sticks? Germany scientist leader, drama teacher. result, Germany vaccine someone puts India costumes blackface, begs India vaccines. Pathetic. realize wearing masks alone won’t stop shit comes flu? would also mandate social distancing. That’s happening already chronic itp, I’m remission right tough get there. wonder could trigger relapse. beaten parents, abused parents, molested raped uncles/moms boyfriends. 

While school hell me, many friends place safe. community Canadian Reddit hates Trudeau enough would like two things:

1. Comment terrible government getting vaccines!
2. Complain method government uses get vaccines.

In regards number one, they'll ignore issues regarding production, global influence, etc. refuse tell *how* exactly getting vaccines (""Better contracts! really stern them!"" best get them.)

In regards number two, they'll take incredibly arrogant (and arguably least little racist) position somehow *better* countries trying get assistance therefore actually *embarrassing* country like India even could help country like Canada. Ew, gross, amirite?!

It's shameful infuriating are. Europe none factories exporting tons it. Israel's great success? Yeah, us. Lets pay people wear hazmat too. Oh wait that’s fucking stupid well. Entering social situations places certain amount risk upon individual regardless illnesses going around given time. Paying population embrace conformity throw huge marker humanity trash ridiculous. 

People going naked harming others fool. Justin's Canada suprised? mortality rate absurdly low. significance this, timing first round vaccines moved since arrive time people lowest groups get second shots. I’m risk adult underlying health issues state says might able get vaccine summer (though hopefully end getting sooner). haven’t even finished vaccinated elderly people yet. would view quite accomplishment could get kids September! hopefully happens know lots people feel better sending kids school vaccinated.  Lol, yeah lost argument. Later. Look people r/canada Trudeau apologists painfully obvious we're unenviable position, begging third world vaccines. way, actually seen evidence harm keeping kids school year, year half.

That's excellent question. point, due respect epidemiologists' perspective risk vs. gain regards vaccination vs. in-person schooling that's question better left us social scientists one without clear-cut answer (currently).

We've generations humans without ""benefits"" formal education it. critical perspective formal education exists among sociologists minority position.

It's entirely clear kinds socialization people believe children learning buttoned barricaded.

Let's keep mind push compulsory education function industrial revolution child development purposes. I'm surprised current push children back school also predicated need parents get back work...regardless framed. Given crisis purported child development specialists vocal one would expect. really doubt it. Look policies countries comes testing, tracing isolating, sending clear message general. Also look Taiwan Vietnam think there’s magical “immunity” South Pacific nations. giant sense humor/ dick contagious means less less vaccines get administered. vaccines highly effective preventing severe illness death (which point). Cases dropping SA despite variant, loosening lockdown there. uk full lockdown 2 past 3 months shows sign leaving yet. Hooray, I’m safe... First, joking. Second, I'm American. Third, problem EU exporting vaccine production US blocking exports. Thanks clarification check subreddit everyday??? /s one, shot administrator said expected side effect! shit. vaccine kept getting symptoms prompted immune response zero effect amount virus body wouldn’t unique, would, best knowledge, require complete rewrite think immune system works Canada none can’t manufacture own. Countries aren’t going kill citizens ship vaccine elsewhere. UK’s next election?

I guarantee government election time summer either a) process opening country b) campaigning opening country c) losing election Kim Campbell style (for non Canadians - imagine inheriting Majority government decimated 2 seats - 1993 Canadian federal election). 

Point - overwhelming population want restrictions pulled soon. Governments comply, get Campbell’d That's great you. state location vaccine 80+ right come across yet. forms make people confirm either 16 Pfizer 18 Moderna.

Three weeks Israel started giving second doses Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine first eligible population group, data watchers starting see hopeful sign: decreasing deaths COVID-19 targeted age group.

Cases, hospitalizations, critical illness also decreased among people aged 60 years older, group prioritized receive vaccinations first, said Eran Segal, PhD, computational biologist Weizmann Institute Science, Rehovot, Israel, interview upcoming episode Medscape's Medicine Machine podcast. vaccination benefit ""striking"" bolsters confidence potency mRNA vaccines B117 strain SARS-CoV-2, dominant Israel, tweeted Eric Topol, MD, Medscape's editor-in-chief co-host podcast Abraham Verghese, MD.

Since Israel's latest peak mid-January, cases among people aged 60 years older declined 55%; hospitalizations declined 40%; critical illnesses, 35%; deaths, 35%, Segal said. trends present people younger 60, began vaccinated later.

Even positive trends, pandemic still far Israel. New weekly cases affect 0.5% population, Segal said, ""a big number.""

Moreover, estimates B.117 variant, first identified United Kingdom, accounts 80% 90% cases.

About 10% people older 60 vaccinated yet, Segal says, progress stalled past 4 5 weeks.

The number severely ill people intensive care also remains high, around 1200 patients. Israeli Ministry Health previously set threshold number severely ill patients hospitals could longer provide adequate treatment 800 patients. interview, Segal told Topol Verghese high number patients compromising patient survival.

In research posted preprint server medRxiv.org in January, Segal colleagues reported care may inadequate even periods number severely ill patients high 800-patient threshold. In-hospital mortality rates 25% higher periods 500 severely ill patients, compared periods fewer 500 patients intensive care units. determined higher mortality rate could attributed changes patient population.

Canada also said give away, even get any. It’s joke.

Empty promises. I'm within USA think irresponsible. given risk population globally, based infection rates risk factors like age. Except, US high infection rates maybe truly need it...  Half nursing home staff third nurses. asshats  Even mummies tested positive. Interesting? country from?

My Uncle stuck care center 50 people died, NY/MA UT different. doctor Utah could easily said okay , send mom care center. room, insurance would paid 100%, would super easy.

Awesome - dad got appointment week next, able make appointment first day group became eligible state Reality often disappointing makes sense, said ""higher US"", sounded surprising sure true, went checked replied found.

I'm Finland realize Austria considered model country given media coverage here! mostly mentioned context initial Finnish cases imported Alps Ischgel saga, maybe big 2nd wave. get much detailed coverage smaller countries policies, unless something extreme going on. Austrian policies think learn from? covid confirmed another year? actually ordered *most* vaccine doses per capita country. Unfortunately, *all* produced overseas.

For example, Pfizer doses going provided US production facility, someone signed executive order forbidding vaccine exports.

That's okay, Pfizer provide Belgian facility. Oh wait, need upgrade one servicing whole world. Oh, EU wants Pfizer use EU produced doses fulfill EU orders first. 

As vaccines come online, problems around vaccine nationalism abate, Canada domestic vaccine production capacity, although none used Covid-19 vaccines right now.

Partly mRNA vaccines pretty new^1, still galling.
Medicago, Quebec company, vaccine candidate Stage 3 testing right example. approved, produced North Carolina facility, funded built around 10 years ago.

Remember pandemic preparedness index years ago, US ranked first world? part vaccine production capacity US high, years years investment. Trump may trashed bunch Pandemic preparedness, still lot depth.

^1 Providence Therapeutics mRNA vaccine production capability, busy developing vaccine candidate, maybe available another 6 months instead licensing producing Moderna Pfizer vaccine.

As outsider, whole vaccine race seems *stupid* amount ""NIH"" (Not Invented Here) going on. *course* someone's vaccine candidate going approved first. license it? require/reimburse developers using capacity produce already approved vaccines still testing?

“My best guess is, though, fervent hope is, certainly, time next year, basically back normal. mean, without significant degree current controls place.”

It emerged social distancing restrictions remain place least autumn reduce transmission virus plans considered ministers.

The Times understands government’s route lockdown based assumption people wear facemasks remain metre apart months. Scientists believe restrictions may need place end year.

“The thinking social distancing need place long time come,” Whitehall source said. “It repercussions scale reopening. Restaurants, pubs offices need Covid-secure.”

Dear god. Ok, good day. [2]

The infection survey shows percentage people testing positive decreased regions England, except southwest rate decline appeared levelled off, although ONS said: “Caution taken over-interpreting small movements latest trend.”

Crofts added: “The percentage positive cases compatible new UK variant also continues decrease regions England except Yorkshire Humber, East Midlands South West trends remain uncertain.”

The government said R estimate UK, number indicating many people infected person pass virus to, 0.7 0.9, outbreak shrinking 2 5 per cent day.

The R estimate 1 every region England, spokeswoman said, meaning “we confident epidemic shrinking across NHS England regions”.

She added: “However, prevalence virus remains high, remains important everyone continues stay home order keep R value down, protect NHS help save lives.”

Professor Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London, key architect first lockdown, said hopeful primary schools would able reopen next month infection rates falling faster anticipated. optimistic UK could avoid another lockdown, long present restrictions lifted carefully vaccines worked well.

“We’re better place might anticipated month ago,” told Politico’s Westminster Insider podcast.

“The lockdown really driven cases quite fast. They’re basically halving every 17 days moment so, means month’s time — prime minister’s talked potentially reopening schools, might bandwidth that, least primary schools.

“And continue see continued decline without large outbreaks, perhaps [we start] relax aspects society following month.”

He said “real-world effectiveness” Covid-19 vaccines would key factor fast Britain could return normal way life.

“I’m hopeful final lockdown — long relatively cautious coming lockdown,” said. [1]

Coronavirus cases continuing decline across UK government estimating R number fallen one first time since July.

According Office National Statistics infection survey estimated 695,400 people England Covid-19 week ending February 6, 18 per cent week before.

It first time figure 700,000 since week ending December 18.

The government estimate R number, tracking transmission rate virus, fell one first time since July, meaning scientists confident outbreak shrinking.

The current halving time virus (the time takes number new infections halve) thought 14 17 days.

Government scientific advisers believe continues, aided vaccine programme, low case numbers could result looser restrictions may achieved next two three months.

As Wednesday, 13,509,108 people UK received first dose coronavirus vaccine, suggesting 15 million doses could reached soon tomorrow.

Sarah Crofts, senior statistician survey, said: “Rates infection remain high continued decrease England across UK, Wales, Northern Ireland Scotland seeing decreases estimated percentage people testing positive Covid-19.”

The figures reported infection survey remain much higher picked testing system reported daily government. week ending February 6, figure 109,500 England.

The discrepancy partly explained ONS survey repeatedly swabbing representative sample households, whether symptomatic not, picking cases NHS Test Trace, relies people developing symptoms coming forward.

Government scientists believe increasing use lateral flow tests, pick fewer cases, community testing programme may play role, fact ONS figures published lag.  country absolutely 100% open point summer.

Comparing March-April 2020 apples oranges. confidently said almost every region across country seen sustained substantial decline cases hospitalizations.

My major hope HSB SF October go. Covid flu. causes [organ [long [blood symptoms much frequently, even mild/no symptoms. also contagious. r number 2 means average infected person infects two people. exponential. number 1 means average 1 person infects 1 person would constant infection rate.

Carry hand sanitizer case need touch adjust mask hands clean. 

Take Uber afford. Go walk. Depending live time day, train lines much emptier pre pandemic times. 

When get home, take shoes outside leave out. Hand sanitize open front door. Immediately eddy hands change clothes go back spray shoes Lysol something bringing in. 

I know nurses EMS workers who've thick whole time proper safety precautions contracted viruses year. nurses vaccinated already. two EMS friends dumbasses though want take it. 

Anyway, point go safe. Double masks like. Make sure hand sanitizer. Never touch face mouth. Immediately change get home. Family gatherings happening like December. Christmas/holidays caused spike. happened last summer? personalised data

Just play devils advocate - would work EU GDPR country? Would pandemic investigation override data protection? Easy China Personally think still pump breaks little. PA still able get grandparents vaccinated. want get it, ready return 100% normalcy Yeah it’s stupid hell. EU bunch idiots. killing citizens. really good. Keep taking there’s good evidence helping. Partially situation different couple months ago. Nobody outside trials received vaccine countries approved vaccines yet. vaccines going solid evidence ability make thing easily manageable. 


I might voted December sure would August. really hope pull together help underdeveloped countries! Come human race this!!! use every opportunity shove words mouth said - yes damn right name call

You're living fantasy world think Australia way like - stop it. Get help. EU already send vaccines America. It’s confirmed latest report. 

The USA allow exports. export them? case, first week November symptoms appeared (confirmed PCR test). Recovered two weeks later. I'm right cusp ""90 days"" often hear about. AZ happening soon, hear within week. J&amp;J heard anything rush supply waiting around us would expect April.  
For Novavax tricky. started rolling review (whereas J&amp;J/Oxford started October) guess Health Canada wait phase 3 clinical trial US/Mexico approving. Long story short would expect trial late April approval happening mid late May.  
I also expect J&amp;J/Oxford Q2 vaccine shipments look similar Moderna/Pfizer Q1 (thinking 1M-4M doses per manufacturer Q2). Novavax supply later quarter could expect similar numbers. pending Health Canada approval. Ugh gave chills. much hope May wedding 😭 wide needle.

high resolution syringe. mom got vaccination date. excited, also little nervous given (emphasis SOME) reactions. never like tells someone comes health (or betting sports game). told her, though is:

Pretend one million people use hand cream. using hand cream, 3 people die. 100 people develop skin rash. 300 people get carpal tunnel syndrome. Would blame cream? Maybe caused rash someone sensitive skin. likely, three people dying basic probability.

You're vaccinating million people day. There's going hiccups - caused issues beyond control (or vaccine's control). every issue hear about, there's hundreds thousands people perfectly fine. Well Australians super butthurt days headline something along line ""Vaccine drive go envision planned new procedure use low dead space needle fizzle current supply low dead space needle found"" Nah, I'm California people following restrictions following now. probably enough got infected can't spread can't spread safe. noticed changes behavior different people know LA last couple weeks, despite numbers plummeting like bird flew airplane 2.02 doses administered million Friday compared 1.62 million last Friday. growth promising week week. 1.1 million first doses also nice touch. Always like see number 1 million. Yeah media wants something keep people clicking, politicians want excuse hold onto power. basically Thursday numbers right update like 6AM shots done today? False. said actually comforted me, know I'm one feeling way.

I'm concerned small, yet sizeable population people - teachers unions epidemiologists want zero COVID. Ya say significant severity reinfection. patient still hospital. Good point. Viral load something often overlooked discussing transmission. 

I've seen people freak unmasked person rides bicycle. There's way would receive enough viral load become infected, facts often fall fear.

That tweet super confusing though. LOL love everyone thread getting giddy latest Trudeau lie, despite fact **EVERY WEEK** Trudeau said vaccines coming - shipments reduced cut completely. Takes special kind idiot actually get excited latest daily dose lies. Lets get vaccines actually land, we'll celebrate. Man gets covid, man recovers, months later man gets covid time found SA variant. Man gets severe respiratory infection. Authors state recovery mild covid infection might able cause immune response reinfected variants.

Basically, found first time someone got severe reinfection variant even though body recovered previously non-variant covid infection.

I draw conclusions n = 1. studies come similar data, might concerning. Anecdotally, I've taking standard multivitamin vitamin supplements contract virus, zero symptoms. State in? Ohio CVS, Kroger, Giant Eagle giving ton summer similar last summer hopeful know another wave upper hand.

(again, assume supply chain extremely constrained)  Hey really informative, thank you! Ummm..

Its 2 months since vaccinations started, dont see 2 months = 1/4 year. 2 months 1/6 year? less 2 months  Oh... hm. That’s kind bunk deal. least US taxpayer funded vaccine development exchange get guaranteed doses Pfizer said deliver 120m doses end Q1 (March).

Denmark runs extreme on-dose strategy think, probably done June, done first dose June amount doses.

I actually plotted it, EU hit vaccine herd immunity (80% total population) one month behind US (using Dutch numbers). difference extreme. 1 month extra expensive. slow. we've vaccinating quarter year 3M doses day... bad That’s another 2 million day correct? idea proof vaccination + 14 days (the time maximum efficacy kick in) substitute negative test?

Twice many Americans ***per capita*** fully vaccinated Canadians one shot. United Nations doesn’t consider Ukraine developed nation “economy transition”, similar Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, etc. 

But guess they’re smart knowledgeable you. article:

OVIEDO, Spain 
-

As new COVID-19 cases continued drop Thursday, regional governments Spain moved ease restrictions, defiance central government’s advice.

“It fundamental regions maintain restrictions […] careful UK variant. Spain, already around 550 cases many suspicious cases,” Health Minister Carolina Darias told Spain’s Radio Nacional.
-

As Wednesday, Spain reported around 428 new cases per day per million people last week. That’s four times higher Germany, announced extending lockdown March 7, almost twice high UK, remains closed.

Unlike countries, Spain undergone strict lockdown since spring 2020. wave infections come thanks patchwork local measures include closing bars non-essential shops, enforcing curfew early 10 p.m. local time (2100GMT) limiting people traveling cities.

But Thursday, government Castile-La Mancha said reopen hospitality sector remove inter-regional travel restrictions, Extremadura Friday. Officials also announced bars restaurants reopen weekend city Malaga.

Meanwhile, Madrid Galician governments hinted would also begin ease measures. 

This week, Basque Country reopened bars restaurants worst-hit areas court ruled evidence establishments led increased ruling, judge behind decision, Luis Ángel Garrido, ruffled feathers told press epidemiologists “are regular family doctors taken little course.”


On Thursday, Spain reported 17,583 infections – 12,000 fewer day last week. Hospitalizations also continued gradual decrease, 41% country’s intensive care units still remain occupied COVID-19 patients.

Deaths, hand, still climbing. Health Ministry confirmed another 513 fatalities, 81 last Thursday.

So far, Spain administered 2.3 million vaccine doses – 80% vaccines received – nearly 950,000 people received doses. 

Today, Spain started vaccinating essential workers like police, teachers prison workers AstraZeneca vaccine. younger 55 without serious medical issues receiving jab. nah im good recommendation *not* go store flu/a cold all. yes, thank rephrasing exactly said longer, thought version mid January US averaging 1 million shots day. 3 weeks later we're currently averaging 1.5 million shots per day breaking 2 million (like today!). expected we'll get 3 million shots per day fairly soon. include single dose Johnson Johnson shot available March. Add together we'll hopefully see massive increase vaccinated individuals soon. 

Also Fauci saying everyone vaccinated April, anyone wants one able get list one. I'd expect end May everyone desperately wants one least first dose. we'll dive much harder work vaccinating hard reach people hesitant people. dead body. sure world, area US, donate Red Cross they'll test blood anti-bodies free. see, makes sense then. even then, could space bit give people chance get first dose hopes production scale 12 week mark enough new people needing second shot.

Basically skipping trial phase releasing general public. release fact one huge trial, public test group. Yeah, India unexpectedly hard hit Covid-19, neither central African countries. South America suffered worse seemingly. 

So seem purely temperature related. Maybe air conditioning common South America, spreading virus? 

Just guessing here... deadly environment is, careful average person becomes. People aware risks, modify behavior keep risk tolerable level. 

We could also prevent car accidents mounting big steel spike middle steering wheel, instead airbag. would cause drivers careful.  would recommend ""safety"" feature, though.

The risk dying covid infection greater flu infection.  And, amount caution needed prevent COVID, greater prevent flu.  flu avoided side-effect avoiding COVID.

I would recommend starting COVID pandemic method prevent flu, either. Floridans much better personal responsibility then? Yeah Trump administration's vaccine funding part well done.

Wish distribution plan besides ""let states handle it"" though. Trump buffoon, Warp Speed good program. Ya, kinda assumed. know, since lied every day. agree. exact dangerous logic — white people must “educate” “civilize” minorities cultures — got us imperialism slaughtering native Americans.

Good luck.     fun working McDonald’s 75% people flu asymptomatic mild symptoms? Gee sure sounds familiar. whole 150 people second highest year, 2018. means USA finish vaccination program much quicker Canada buy excess supply hopefully done September.

I wanna go Vegas November without get Covid test followed bullshit 3 day $2000 hotel stay upon return. people NY already living nursing homes terrible loss, people seriously think vaccines come without risk harmful issues?

You get comments removed subreddit acknowledging that, yes lot people think argue others. Personally reason believe vaccines particularly harmful there's denying lot people speak little highly them. know science works it’s constant changing shit new evidence comes like first cdc said mask say it’s best layer science constantly changing please shut fuck exactly UK doing. pfizer AZ vaccine. Eventually, yes. ""some sort norm"" beginning. Even 200 million vaccines distributed, COVID around months various variants. know long current vaccines last. yes - sort norm come first. Usually virus first shot enough get body fight first shot virus itself.

You probably need second shot, get anyhow, I'm doctor. 46-47 million vaccines administered far, could herd immunity five months. beginning last month, 1 4 million vaccines administered. read would need 70% population herd immunity 230 million people. 230/47=4.89 months get herd immunity minimum.

That's optimistic numbering. numbers right herd immunity mid-July. like fish sticks mouth? never will. Guaranteed. They'll scared cause people stop cautious.

Virtually everywhere adopted half-baked lockdown policy immense advantages failed. They've virtually ended appreciably better Florida, Georgia, Sweden, places responded sanely. 

And dodged point raised economic impact policies, Victoria [absolutely felt decades. seems guys get enjoy repeat performance it, was, know, successful first time.

On balance, best say lockdowns extremely costly means controlling fatality rate vaccine came rescue. whether cost actually worth something grapple years come, places lucky you, there's really debate even had. completely impossible given know. Missionaries shouldn’t allowed anywhere near villages I'll take two please. vulnerable groups vaccinated, protecting children from? County, Ventura, CA, tracked. 0-17, inception record keeping today represent 15% total infected, 11,000 72,000 people infected.

Over past month, 1 person category died.

The message infected symptoms mild minimal, outlier cases. kind COVID test required much typically cost? test negative, lose flight money refunded? everyone afford risk variables. Well turn liability waivers - money talks louder anything else. I'm Canadian agree this. Missionaries earned bad rep. time *weren’t allowed gather groups* know, whole pandemic thing. 

It wasn’t arrest based beliefs, based public inciting large groups people break law public health orders.

It doesn’t matter peaceful pretended be. kind people March “against tyranny lockdown” aren’t going wear masks behave safe fashion anyway. got second dose week. Side effects worse much worse. seems great deal variability person seems like women get severe side effects. Long term risks unknown. Anyway, rushed vaccine nursing infant. permanent residency, I'm pretty sure family able come country - need return negative COVID test 3 days boarding flight 14 days quarantine upon arrival. population Australia vaccinated, sure plan be. Maybe quarantine? Maybe lighter quarantine? also apply basic tourist visitation? I'm talking immigration, I'm talking travel. cares, China didn’t wait either nobody said damn thing. theory whole time getting vaccine secured actually hard Trump bad job.

Turns I'm probably right. Fuuuuuuuuck no. piss farted around w/ postcode lockdowns, blitz testing, etc etc. Half measures ended wasting everyone's time.

Actual lockdown called near 200 cases/day. Stage 4, 500 odd.

This time, there's 2-3, _almost_ control it. used last resort, ""we need space"", get ahead.

Completely different. People coming Australia require visas, even refugees. Every person accepted refugee immigrant need vaccinated arrive. Obtaining visa reside Australia costly couple dollars extra get vaccinated country origin drop ocean. Refugees money given vaccine free charge well board flight Australia. Undocumented asylum seekers arriving without visas automatically go immigration detention tested vaccinated case asylum heard court. housing lockdown done reason, complaints medication food “being denied” found mostly trumped bleeding heart media. 

It affected small portion society unfortunately also one vulnerable groups. Stopping outbreak towers critical health safety city, elderly vulnerable groups higher concentration within places.

These hard decisions made. complain optics like, successful manoeuvre saved lives cut time already shockingly long lockdown. 

The tower lockdowns actually completed efficiently effectively time, fact people trying compare human rights abuses, “welding doors shut” insult actual marginalised groups suffer yoke real authoritarian governments. 30th time Australia ""beaten"" coronavirus?

The reason COVID cases letting people country countries 'beaten' COVID19. reward beating coronavirus living constant fear next draconian lockdown.

Better living constant fear getting deadly virus... People going goddam drunk summer. woman 20s got arrested posting Facebook event anti-lockdown protest, judging post itself, like violent COVID denial thing. suggested wearing masks social distancing peaceful. protest **didn't even happen**, got visited cops incitement. Sorry, kind authoritarian, dismiss concerns 'just wanting Taco Bell' straw-manning. J&amp;J gets faster.

Given people seem willing distancing closures much longer im guessing J&amp;J vaccine key getting things open summer. think letting people developing countries protect new strains? That's roll dice, dude. coronavirus. ends justify means?

Not suggesting think course interesting statement. Something 35% urban population living slums. disease needs social distancing tackle, surely India bad position deal this. well isolated communities little access medical care furlough programmes. 

But sure, cry racism wet wipe People families abroad, especially migrant workers. need Thanos meme vaccines together ultimate immunity immigrant families get told shove it, what?

Do mean people wanting emigrate Australia families living Australia expats? Maybe chat people Victorian government literally [locked inside apartments two found denied appropriate food, medicine, even fresh air week. yeah, absolutely zero reason concerned government's policies. Basically every government lol, COVID going make argument little easier even left-of-center people. know downvoted. unpopular among Modi supporters government made huge mistake approving Covaxin without phase 3 trial results, might increasing vaccine suspicion. (IIRC reports people hesitating sign Bharat biotech forms). late take U-turn say ""We're pausing get results,"" heighten skepticism.  

Sure, factors like people chalta hai attitude covid general, hard imagine least 10 15% would turned up, Oxford-AZ vaccine. current 50-60% attendance rate low. Four EU member states offered sign separate COVID-19 vaccine agreements, outside EU deals framework, British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca order get vaccines faster others, Czech PM Andrej Babiš unveiled Thursday (11 February).

So, AstraZeneca cut supplies EU order sell EU members higher price. 

And say AstraZeneca provides vaccine non-profit basis. Fuck approach. Protection hospitalisation deaths enough. friend die shit home, never hospitalised, felt fine, boom, died covid. :( Africa country genius. Basically, yes. Nothing wrong that, Canada developed country, important qualifier things. don’t know color skin that. sounds less position Sweden reasonable Handled pandemic well setting program allow people earn money staying home.

Signing Paris Climate accord introducing carbon tax tying tax returns.

Gave millions indigenous communities purpose combating mental health suicides communities.

Just use google bud. Arguably good. know many young-ish people admin staff zero patient contact lab workers non-Covid stuff who've already got shots elderly, high-risk people know can't even get appointment first. Personally, covid made determined ever kill honestly. Yeah shit, imagine going note. True. That's mentioned genetics. Oh I’m forced stay home meagre *5 days*! Better third wave another 4 month long lockdown (which, despite mental health toll, would gladly needed), bring circuit breaker! need tell night, sleep? Umm, it’s competition guys! Thos 27k people (which mostly old anyway) saved cost economy, half year lives lost 25 Million inhabitants, countles new mental health problems, peobably retirement, economy etc sure taking sweet time. Humans (scientists), hand, pretty phenomenal. I'd happy actually waiting list. Trying get appointments eldetly parents county means choosing appointment slot, filling 5 pages info told appointments available repeat again... hate say it, think Mets winning lossing year. Hopefully win less games Braves. Well can't retro-actively call ethical turns works intended. sets dangerous precedent.

They could done mass testing beforehand, consent. Given Russia's huge population (and kind like Israel now), I'm sure could found enough people would consent. support deaths many thousands. 
There right here, wrong. Name checks Ah ok, notice makes sense. Scare media? conspiracy nut something? reporting known. know, millions people died, deserves scared. want live fear something peobably gives sniffles 20s (which assume reddit) people go away within 24-48 hours Heck yeah I’d love one. 🥰 Conspiracy nuts never stop making stuff media.

Lockdowns need actually lock things enforced. wonder voting you. agree you. vaccinate risk people Earth first. means certain countries get others less.

But looks promising world wide. victims airlifted Australia Australian citizens repatriated could continue care Australia well enough make trip. victims cared 4 different hospitals burn units able provide excellent care. Patients werent sent Australia cope. keep replying every comment thread. isn’t going change fact Cuomo lied, forced nursing homes take sick covid patients, lied it, nerve write book like something good.

UK explicitly advises pregnant women receive Sure. people symptoms isolate themselves. Every vaccinated person helps reduce transmission rate. 


Every vaccinated vulnerable group reduces hospitalization rate. 


Every vaccinated person reduces hosts help virus mutate. 


Remember, 2 months ago one vaccinated. virus running completely wild uninhibited. changed now, every day put barriers it. **still** understand people almost universally comfortable public-private partnerships using vaccine passport apps track every time go damn bar. learn anything NSA scandals? people think it'll 'just temporary' must post-9/11 zoomers. vaccine you’re referring dropped administered anyone, count enough testing you? want vaccines them

You forget variants.

There'll always another variant scare, rolling lockdowns/travel bans next 5 years. sounds like tyranny Sometimes, yes, do. unethical way developed it. Basically skipping trial phase releasing general public.

But works, also argued ethical rush save lives using vaccine earlier. LA Unified sadly already said vaccines mandatory children return school. one allowed wait feel data shows vaccine safe children, unfortunately. foresee lot people relocating due scenarios akin one. Everyone needs get kids immunized. That's works. God help us lol. sensible pharma business person

Modi shitting vaccines man wtf ahahha Basically entire state California 100% remote since mid-March 2020. canada getting vaccines, set orders received march 31, compared us paying extra first doses produced. also unrealistic expect us export vaccines facing much worse pandemic banking global goodwill pretty stupid move. 

regardless canada behaved towards Ironic considering Alfred Nobel invent nitroglycerin made commercial product it. 2024 :(

And vaccine rollout good, that's people remember, Tories voted like always :( opinion precaution mine same. 

The difference is, advocate enforcing opinion. That's really COVID, box COVID written it. fuels Anti-Vax sentiment anyway, screw him. Keep head sand. come look around, open mind. requested Genie bag. Lockdowns border closures standard practice on.  Mate Melbourne's spike peaked winter already strong decreased eliminated spring warm weather Moderna also shown strong response well.

Many countries let without proving sufficient money live amount time expect stay for. Last time, 700 plus cases day, 13 cases, much easier track everybody, get testes isolated 14 days, increases coming days, fine. Also, last time's lockdown announced 6 weeks (not 5 days), problem many people follow rules started new clusters, delaying recovery. That's vaccine! know Russia predominantly populated white people? Great that's one got -,- Plus living constant fear next draconian lockdown anyway. EU export restrictions. UK US do. estimated worse case side effects better risk getting severe covid delaying unethical? 

It's kind like starving death GMO food storage know 100% GMO safe.

President Biden announce yesterday increased purchased vaccines Americans want one vaccinated end summer early fall! take larger pharma partner. larger partner US government. 

I thought Moderna several partners manufacturing doses?

While agree Moderna huge success, part luck. countries bet companies others companies. Imagine warp speed mainly counted AZ, Merck vaccines failed delays. got lucky vaccines bet well level domestic manufacturing those. big question is, many months take use 200 million person supply? June 1 plus six weeks (second dose plus waiting) already puts mid July everyone got day one. think we're still looking late summer earliest. (Not political) 

Trump lost election 5 days. 

He went debate told everyone flu thousands Americans dying, caught covid, got $500k experimental cloned anti body treatment, denied stimulus checks Americans unless election, went back White House ripped mask showing doesn’t care infecting others 

Ok, um, good you. done done.

Because something done purpose mean value. Gotcha...thanks. People quick claim following supporting data:

1. Vaccines prevent transmission
2. variants make vaccines less effective evade them

Now evidence mounts contrary claims, many (perhaps disingenuously) saying ""no evidence"" ""we know"". Yeah that's said creeping back normal. It'll ramp next 6 weeks I'm sure mind reading people actively said things ran headlines. Well 500 cases half million sounds like effective 93% me. someone else nice enough explain it. point article say children want vaccine less adults. seems obvious points, like r/kidsarefuckingstupid. worst makes trust article quote sorts reasons – don’t know enough vaccines, others may misconceptions them.

They children, don’t like stabbed sharp metal objects. realize point article, even mentioning asked kids factor means data (or maybe article) worthless IMO. It’s entirely possible large gap ranges disinterest liking shots. concept kids still make people sick kids aren’t sick eludes like half US adults. don’t know it’s different UK, parents decide give kids shots, school, kid’s mentality usually follows parents. So, good luck changing mind 7yo presentation vaccine side effects efficacy. Possibly. Current guidance US mix first-second doses Pfizer Moderna “exceptional situations”. study conducted right UK efficacy mixing two vaccines. study looking mixing AZ vaccine Pfizer vaccine. saw that, get posted sub article discussion? used ABC News Twitter link President video saying exactly got removed twitter.com. don’t problem Well depends person. fun came house (movies, restaurants, amusement parks, sports games, concerts, arcades, travel, gatherings, events, etc.) basically gave lot life time. you’re type doesn’t mind sitting home gaming watching TV, maybe don’t lose much life. 523,000 people exposed coronavirus time frame looking at. It’s messaging fit narrative hand. 

In reality, think scenarios degree bad. know long term effects asymptomatic covid cases? No, could bad? Possibly. worse increased probability symptomatic illness you’re vaccinated? No. end result illness better asymptomatic, asymptomatic illness better symptomatic. vaccine helps those. It’ll allow much lower risk opening everything back fully. demonstrating amazing mind reading powers. Got it. People breeze it, despite risk-enhancing pre-conditions. dad late 60s, overweight, lifelong desk-job workaholic, little regular exercise: tested positive anti-bodies experienced symptoms all. are, definition used get 66% number, 0% effective.

That number defined reduction number illnesses among vaccinated people compared received placebo (who used bodies natural efficacy).

Of course, definition *very misleading* human body actually rather good job fighting disease--just much worse assistance vaccine. agree extent. think still risk one last wave quickly eliminating possibility vaccinations. 

For example, 10-12 million people completed vaccinations, yes decent chunk elderly also lot HCWs there. 

There roughly 50-70 million people truly high risk (65+ extreme medical conditions). 

In 6-8 weeks large fraction fully vaccinated.

(Schools closed first state emergency) I’ve seen couple articles take Biden said bit context. 

Per Daily Mail, Biden said: 

'You know wearing mask next year save lives, significant number lives.” 

I saw article Fox suggested said “wear masks next year” (that is, 2022.) is, opinion, totally Biden said—I think it’s reach (and holy fuck want misleading article).

I’m saying like Biden saying think mask mandates should/will place come fall, someone street said Biden said quote above, would impression might around next year places, person absolutely saying masks would worn “through 2022.” make history, fellas!!! taste maskless freedome already  Lol pulling 10% from? dare person plan move life death loved one right? suggesting adopt Victorian era “mourning periods”?

Life goes one shitty side effects dying people love do. thing is, family Philippines. (the Philippines) receiving vaccines US. fact, President threatening halt military exercises US supplies (which Philippines ordered anyway). 

Though can’t speak scale effort, US distributing vaccines least one country, South East Asian/Developing one that.

 I’m sure kind agreement could reached Canada especially vaccines. Admittedly, much Canada likes distance US, I’m sure much played role negotiations. mean b117 variant? supposed name variants viruses place discovered. doesn’t wipe covid face earth altogether (which really realistic target anyway)

I glad US rolling vaccine (I high risk, signed January soonest get April...), good Australia vaccine, know country continues much much safer. would rather slow vaccine rollout low transmission rates, pretty sure everyone thinks that. know initially stated PCR tests accurate rapid test. eventual Ellume home testing kit 96% effective believe, rapid tests outdoor sites still less accurate PCR? so, difference? Actually find thinking fascinating. Would avoid travel certain parts world required vaccinations example also? Vaccine 100% effective, therefore worthless! think could ever see French politician complimenting British, way around. April May we’re going vaccinating young healthy people 

Not fucking chance. Leave Europeans blame everybody selves misgivings. too, friend. too. Can't let CCP get bad press now. That’s literally do. sucks, you’re committed you’re likely get one. 

We hunch they’d release bunch Super Bowl people “in know” could easily get appointments friends/family. That’s exactly happened lol got couple appointments know...its embarrassing. Further, won’t take JJ. I’ll wait high efficacy shot. America getting lot eventually, I’m concerned. 

I think people accept JJ either 1) Don’t know better 2) medical conditions put high risk 3) aren’t worried getting virus anyway (it’ll hard get group show all). Oh, handful people also afraid mRNA vaccines. like JJ too.  question transmission ... Meaning virus present. People experience field know lot chance properly use resources position best way can. lot right lot wrong nothing chance *cue squarespace youtube ad* know, something like actually antivax talking point. Every place safe people follow CDC precautions. Obviously failed badly following guidelines don’t think public schools better jo figured considering one year army screwed ended get two flu shots lol 

I mean... can’t much different right lol “Science” man, long-term care facility resident late forties several co-exisiting diseases conditions 

Oof, late forties already long term care facility? sad. Interesting. Thanks tidbit info. mom concerned second Moderna shot getting next month. tf virus detected, transmission possible time frame. testing everyone , symptomatic people. Yeah, people gotten caught trying cheerlead certain countries scientist behind forgotten. University Pennsylvania created foundational IP behind Modern Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. *Both companies literally paying licensing fees university.* foundational Kariko/Weissman work funded entirely American taxpayer, National Institutes Health. People read  difficult? We’ve numerous studies already that, found asymptomatic people rarely spread covid. 

There really isn’t question anymore. current rules virus, asymptomatic people rarely ever transmit. devil incarnate would thing ! /s see Berkeley news, usually weird decision making. work well 100% guarantee like claimed.

I never claimed 100% protection!

I claimed record large super spreading event like one described Article CAN'T HAPPEN proper masking 100% true.

Masking highly, highly reduces probability infection. 


My post 100% accurate. Proper masking virtually eliminates events like described above. 

The title highly misleading implies PPE work. DOES

Your editing type misinformation promotes coronavirus. Oh no. Don’t go narrative. I’m sure everyone already read eua stating injection won’t stop transmission sars cov2 symptoms covid 19. it’s really cold ~99.9 survival rate. wait, around 80% people already zero symptoms. Hmm, nothing see get them? fuck taking about. Tens millions cases hundreds thousands deaths ""a lot"" half population? Let guess, think black death deadly killed half Europe. cited, author may turn right. good see progress, mean guarantee it'll keep going like that. Lol guys seriously think rest world living fear day day basis?

Yes, countless news reports, documentaries, podcasts plus friends family overseas I've personally spoken to.
You honestly think live fear lockdown? Haha. lockdown minor inconveniance me. Literally way impacted life 5 days: 1) worked home 2) wore mask went outside. that's scarier people dying, think got issues man Definitely great source country denies responsibility deaths millions Palestinians.  “Canada doesn’t plan appropriately secure vaccines “Blame US”.

What? insightful profound reply, A++ seems analogous battery design... Ask 10 battery engineers get 15 different opinions ... It’s crazy. think part Louisiana still fairly strict 1A qualification needs expand 1B 1C get larger pool people want it. know folks want it, don’t meet criteria.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* oh fuck's sake . . . look forward folks like screeching loudest awful 2022 still can't open anything facial paralysis, blood diseases reports positive infection multiple vaccinations! think ignored right life part there’s cumulative effect - 80% population vaccinated 20% safer. 

Obviously depends R value behavior there’s one-two punch every vaccination - I’m safer people around safer. bad Newfoundland now. Really bad. much since initial wave back last spring returned bad way. went 1 case Sunday 100 yesterday (74 high school students!). virus got loose age group sports gathering particularly last weekend. opened sports Christmas boom. cases main city area. come 200x reduction deaths? AFAIK nobody died vaccinated far What's mutant variant situation Israel? PA's Health Ministry made public statement specifically saying want Israel's help, mad Israel didn't... use military force overrule PA's decision, guess? pretty obvious want bash Israel seem care apparently calling Israel use force overrule Palestinian government's decision, odd choice ""pro-Palestinian"" person make.

Furthermore, flimsy dismissal public statement made Palestinian Authority grounds ""every Israeli news source lies said so"" irrelevant. sub cares facts, PA Health Ministry really publicly say want Israel's help vaccine.

Please take refusal acknowledge reality r/conspiracy belongs. downvoted right preventing people using masks see report region (Kungsbacka municipality) banned face masks librarians. Watch video swedish SVT.  is... Exhausting. luckily husband science-loving introverts.

We know percent asymptomatic cases long term negative health effects, ain't 0. could low. virus could like chicken pox dormant phase, or.... Anything!

We going absolutely everything power make sure baby eligible *control group* research study effects COVID-19 fetal/infant development. 









. whole world going immunity one way another virus may mutate escape neutralization effects still far less bad due built immunity. Eventually might similar common cold flu most. school goes much better schedule March 15, around warm weather starts out. I’m really hoping it’s turning point terms restrictions don’t want unnecessarily go past spring. learn take care themselves”
 
Pretty galling position occupying nation take. live SF Georgia, (distance marriage). reopened Georgia stayed open: reopened once!

Telling people ""be patient"" close one year anniversary ""Two weeks flatten curve!"" rings bit hollow. would appreciate media acted though lucky instead constantly saying vaccines change anything. California effing something up? Noooooo way. mean write 50 million sorry :) thought obsessed English &amp; semantics &amp; can't infer information well know really dumb COVID &amp; proven entire point focus bad news can't trust people think &amp; make safe decisions sake around them. feel lot better now. thank you.

masks protect around you, yourself. 60% COVID cases asymptomatic dont even know contagious &amp; need wear mask, that's always wear one.

you rely others tell do. sad. 4 severe cases among fully vaccinated Israelis.

""tHaT knOw Of"" /s good material consider open mic night. fucking guy lmao. Fuck that, I'm wearing mask past Memorial Day. I've decided that's I've got me, that's day start living life normally again. I've good law abiding citizen year, have, I'm done suffering. That’s read it, too.

He also didn’t specify exactly — ie, every single person going required wear mask *all* settings outside home, *entire* year? Likely, no. I’m waiting comerciales saying took lungs,cancer, 5 missing toes call number now. know says looks cool. Feels like could easily take ""we still this"" reference vaccine research microbiologists like ""worrying it."" makes slightly unethical, know?

Yes? And? **WE** **WARY** that? make vaccine dangerous danger; carefully watching guarding deception, trickery, dangers; suspiciously either troll moron.

I know fact definitely stupid Im crying, I'm pointing selfishness ignorance businesses probably stick masks optics keep liability down. customers feel comfortable masks would use services require them, good tradeoff business. also think healthcare settings public transit keep awhile.

Mask wearing outdoors jogging outside chillin? see ending summer mask heavy places like California. Earlier elsewhere. think hysteria around masks also die vaccinated, become personal choice. sounds like popular opinion Yeah emergency test situation around $350. without factoring stress situation. absolute garbage!

The vaccines protect variants equal efficacy 90-95%! outlier AstraZeneca South African variant (and like U.S purchasing AZ dosages right anyway.) mean look Israel case study...70% population least gotten first dosages, U.K variant dominant strain. negatively impacting inoculation efforts. IHME needs reality check. I'd like know too. ain't antibiotics plausible billion. think missed points. No, misinterpreting doctors saying. saying vaccines, do. statements contradicts Swedish public service SVT report Swedish region (Kungsbacka municipality) banned face masks librarians. Watch video swedish Verifiably false. varies depending state, part state in. See, that's real problem, though. Schools proper ventilation, masking, distancing. local schools opened A/B party time schedules, let us know would maintain 3 foot--not 6--whenever possible. already maintain distancing half capacity classrooms. went back 5 days full time. wear masks... Except, obviously eating breakfast, lunch, snacks, happening non-distanced classrooms. Oh, done teachers apparently let take ""mask breaks"" periodically? really effectively make sure whole class younger kids properly wearing masks day. think consider global impact Ridiculous. February! know Lebanon population 6 million. guess plausible Israel killed 5 million Lebanese people second Lebanon War. preventing going back normal? always end goal right? Mission accomplished. “You know staying home forever save lives.”

Doesn’t mean it’s good idea. says ""the next year here"", never said 2022. heard mean ""over course next year"" 2021, like vaccinations rolled next year (meaning next 12 months).

I hear frustrations, really do. depression really bad lately I've similar thoughts last one. hang there. Nobody knows end, anyone tells lying you. We're suffering uncertainty. Stay strong know *will end*, eventually.

And take hope vaccines, we're incredibly lucky them! treat throwaway comments politicians public health policy, take predictions things going look like 2-3 months advance large grain salt. entire administration nutshell.

One remarkable things administration imo stated beginning alternative facts would thing - started lie obvious needless inauguration day. clear, that’s saying. live population properly vaccinated. flu. think goalposts leave Milky Way pace Well yeah- suck can’t wait set fire. quote predicts still ""be this"" (which take mean covid restrictions) 10 years. hand, risk people want vaccine vaccinated within couple months. huge discrepancy there. grandmother 80s got vaccinated weeks ago NYC multiple appointment opportunities time... access great Internet-literate/English-native otherwise seems plenty slots open eligible. sad pandemic proportions occur highlight shit ton shortcomings government society. Sad thing is, think anyone learn. We'll go back exactly way things before, nothing change. Everyone wants ""normal"" again. get that. almost like fixated it, learn damn thing experience, shut like never happened. US close island nation Australia - continent - governance border controls different. every state US acted like states Australia closed borders outbreaks problems. goes Europe.

These countries even minimum. many Palestinians vaccinated, gotten sick, died?.... Holy shit, science works?! “You people” explain mean that. given comment views mask wearing. Yet appear come conclusion based incomplete information haven’t you. Well goes show usually wrong. 

I issues wearing masks. wear mask required one isn’t. doesn’t mean don’t care people. means follow guidelines put place. disgusting? Please explain. 

If rule masks worn work place wish wear one free too. afforded right wear one wish. 

Listen appear deep seated mental issues causes obsess way. sad hope getting treatment need. Mental illnesses especially debilitating kind joke going make fun that. 

However. Please think type future try make everyone else bad guy. end day responsible Heath. Nobody else. words same, meaning completely different.

When ""He must named"" saying ""Learn live it"" arguing throw everything open let things run course.

When doctors saying it, pointing always remaining endemic amount Covid need monitoring/containment infrastructure place deal that. Yes course would call Trudeau devil he’s Canadian  fuck point vaccines keep shit 2022?

My patience wearing thin. fucking tired existing. Sputnik study recently published Lancet, peer reviewed all. means Russia basically handed data vaccine have, that's way they'll really pass peer review. think concluded 91% effectiveness.

Chinas numbers bit odd, there's real answer that. said before, need post additional sources. Jerusalem Post article quotes statement PA Health Minister specifically said ask Israel's help sufficient.

Your refusal accept public statement real irrelevant. additional sources provided explicitly quote PA's statement, state PA working distribute vaccines, Israel.  Hopefully March like lion like lamb. It’ll start cold risk (elderly) still completing vaccinations April 1 weather warm, days long, vaccines everyone (at least appointments). time hope USA state governments pull back restrictions, seems though Nevada instance blue print little looser now, March 15th, May 1 governor rescinds control. seems somewhat reasonable long goalposts moved yet again. issuestoo. countries much poorer much worse healthcare systems still better US. 

The US way overconfident well prepared. 

I’ve lived overseas long time now, Americans general way overconfident often leads making big mistakes. time unfortunately happened national scale. don’t understand people lose selfishness vaccines. reason wanted vaccine wouldn’t get sick covid sounds like fucking sucks. That’s it. there’s something take prevent getting it, lessen effects get it, give that. helps protect others, added bonus.   single dose Pfizer looks effective J&amp;J shot: Moderna me, please. devil helping Trudeau case Jewish space laser, unstoppable!!! Yes, that's implying. phrased wrong. meant I'd rather avoid two rough days. gfs mom infected March, health care worker got first jab mid December. 24 hours unpleasantness, people office infected felt fine. assumptions infection primer, interesting note 9 months passed. actually said ""through next year here"". Honestly (and I'm serious) think means like ""as continue 2021"". think meant ""next year here"" mean 2022.

Really depends state. I'm high school principal got 2nd dose 2 weeks ago. depends state handling it. Lol there’s people straight face tell return Normal virus completely eradicated unethical immoral.

“We rinderpest” yeah, slaughtering entire herds someone got sick. can’t people. hear sterilizing vaccines think cause infertility rather meaning keeps spreading virus. give us update couple days new mutant powers? link Pfizer - Austria ordered millions changed strategy - talking Astra Zenica - Austria ordered beginning knew help variant. yes prolong pandemic, far we've vaccinated lots people basically uselessly.

And Brazil, several similar cases documented new variant there. Researchers exploring whether reinfections help explain recent surge city Manaus, three-fourths residents thought previously South Africa began worry saw surge cases late last year areas blood tests suggested many people already virus.

 discovered new version virus that’s contagious less susceptible certain treatments. causes 90 percent new cases South Africa spread 40 countries including United led study testing Novavax’s vaccine found less effective new variant. study also revealed infections new variant common among people COVID-19 basically tells us, unfortunately, past infection early variants virus South Africa protect” new one, said. dramatic lol Ph.D. \*Neuroscience\*?

I PhD random field disagree person. get vaccinated? USA allow exports. Everyone else wait USA got ordered. Many countries mit pay price USA pay. It’s bidding everyone. see nothing wrong obviously different understanding solidarity.

First USA refuses real measures contain virus bans exports. Truly America first. They're purposefully vaccinating Palestinians. surprising given it’s 30% lethal. causes worse disease. model (which pretty accurate far) predicts infection rates continue IHME model, notoriously pessimistic, predicts continued decline hospitalizations deaths, minor bump cases appropriate amount measures could result 99% decrease, would quick harsh. Vietnam 35 deaths, Singapore 29, Taiwan 9, there's nothing preventing countries policies. asked evidence millions either. plausible even know almost nothing Palestine may least know population 2 million. father told would tell gladly infertile since means passing dumbass genes get vaccinated sterilized, may never children, still alive. (You could adopt)

If get vaccinated, may die covid never children. (Not adopted) 

Wait? I'm kind confused right ... insane Chicken Little ""Covid exponential every last person infected"" phase. Unfortunately may represent public policy  parents 80s still able get vaccinated, North Carolina. Guys I'm feeling really discouraged today. keep seeing Biden stated wear masks next year. we'll wear masks rest 2021 2022???? fucking end? vaccine here. That's promised. they're like, ""lol jk vaccines actually end this"". waiting for???

Also, Disney CEO said masks stick end 2021. Everyone comments actually okay say wear masks forever protect others. end??? going rest life I'm going check early. Masks. Restrictions. living. It’s bigger news paper doesn’t show say does. literally mention UK variant there.

They tested select mutations SA variant carries, entire set mutations. N501Y one. Another, important mutation SA one carries, E484K testing on. people get vaccinated become prone car crashes, would pretty weird. Obviously saving lives. *how many people died* valid part conversation? course people died getting it, 523,000. I'm wondering many. get quote statement odds other.

Pharma companies remain lookout variants producing regular booster shots needed people also go living lives.  Yeah can't imagine vaccine distribution could get worse time. Usually things get better practice knowledge. Part reason US disaster reckless overconfidence.

I think (i read lot) one reason situation bad USA poverty!

Many People can’t afford healthier Lifestyle or/ Med.

Healthcare US incredible expensive many People Health Insurance.

PS: maybe find official Report MEXT (Japanese Ministry Education, etc.) useful, official Guideline published Autumn 2020! Even me, Dr. Fauci? live Brazil. Oh yeah, misinformation king here. baffling. even know start. Perhaps listing non-island nations succeeded. pointing SF's problems related much complex problems pandemic (I know, live here)? cities locking hard suffering part *because* rest country isn't?

In case, original point returning normal *easier* virus control. we're extremely lucky effective vaccines close hand. patient, roll vaccines majority adults, get things control (not eradicated, quite convinced that's impossible), reopen all.

I advocating *want* reopen, want more. want another shutdown impatient right first time. Let's get done! last two came China, sayin. Thank you. I’ve saying whole time encourage responsible data driven behaviors...but politicians others used pandemic feed power trip. people absolutely insane fear. Berkeley inexcusable realize one state got hit early state information needed do, still engaged genocide, right? People realize keep making comparison equivalent. also delays reporting deaths. reported hour die typically. Also know multiple states reported backlogged death certificates throws off. Tell brother almost died waiting two days admitted hospital. young, healthy, carefree COVID hit body. blood thinners indefinitely can’t work. Fuck conspiracy theorists can’t get heads asses civil human beings care fellow man. would get cold 50% time traveling. I’d happy see masking plane become common thing. mandated, people want think may sick, don’t want stigma. steaming dump mean 1M day Biden took office? I'm NYC allowed go pharmacy grocery store three months.

We weld people apartments though, that's getting at/dreaming of. Still salty? - Australia does. say borders problem.. problem USA unless much weaker appear.

So given problem, problem. sit back go - really care. Palestinian want get mystery injection Israel. Given much Israel dehumanized people vaccine could get tainted things decrease fertility (make sterile). rest world living anything close freedom Australians enjoyed past year.

You mean 3 months normality like countries summer season?

For strict lockdown weird end freedom rest world took much chill approach ""I made assumption Mayo Clinic lab would trusted lab""

You know say... Canada's leadership really lacking really fucked vaccine roll - we're one worst world administration vaccines Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* deaths per million New York much east coast South Dakota stated, confirmed, we're fairly certain was. hopefully, second round mild first. wife major surgery soon work. savings set aside it, rather stay possible. Missing work going make rough goal accomplish.  Transmission within schools less factor community transmission rates. cases declining area, there's necessarily _more_ danger school. That's scary! Viruses crazy. I'm glad need hospitalized end. Give break. Younger people aren’t going suddenly start dying currently (almost never). virus mostly affects elderly at-risk. single dumbest comment I’ve read entire life sincerely believe wrote weren’t making shitty joke education system completely failed you. means 0 deaths, 0 severe cases among 522,996 vaccinated Israelis Whether masks required entirely dependent area. certain US states probably don’t wear one now. several places you’re going real hard time entering businesses without mask probably Q4 year. 

What I’m saying would definitely expect least see around year ends. put foot one person personal feelings masks won’t change reality. California also took strict measures. would anticipate measures, would still cases, freaking epicenter USA. possible enough mRNA vaccines entire adult population willing take summer, though suspect many gotten J&amp;J vaccine then. depressing. spent first months lockdown wringing hands getting control strategies we’d never eradicate it. decided think summer/fall. Finally around November started reading it’s never going away, especially many animal reservoirs spread easily. 

This world envisioned bringing kids into... another disease worry about, vaccines add mix... ugh. Yet level new infections. Similar case fatality despite 70% vaccination (counted first shot) since December 20 almost 2 months harsh lockdowns .... wow impressive. Look ourworlindata.org Liar.  Give half year Americans probably bragging amazing job beating virus. acting like entitled prick follow it?

Because I'll fully vaccinated well then, there's legitimate reason follow it. Maybe use ""but know vaccinated people still spread Covid!"" angle, within months much data confirming essentially can't infection rate would, yes. comparable effectiveness vaccinated vs unvaccinated shouldn't. Instead 1 per 1000 vs 1 per 100k would get say 0.6 per 1000 0.6 per 100k, keeping effectiveness total infections slow down.

As anything statistical gets complicated fast considering everything, barring secondary effects (i.e.: vaccinated people likely around vaccinated people, maybe odds infected drop unrelated immunity) rate infection really impact measured effectiveness. Noone like 1 2 old old people died getting vaccine.

It send 3% 40somethings hospital, kill 0.2% either. Well everyone came Adam according Israel means everyone according lot strains named first isolated.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* omg worst hahahaha  That’s 5,000 doses country given. States given fuck ton autonomy enjoy autonomy. responsibility always scale goat federal government whenever governor shitty job multiple countries well, let’s get folksy like South Dakota kill big portion population “let’s live it” mantra. Doctors aren’t arguing that. article assumes vaccinations happened. Depends business short answer less customers. certainly agree situation Ireland major fucked up. human rights violation through. saw yesterday pre-emptively extended lockdown May... made depressed guys. know put it. spread misinformation. denied israels offer decided go Russian vaccine offered 5,000 doses solely medical workers, whereas Israeli citizens go get one regardless employment. Fuck palestinians tho I’m saying things aren’t necessarily good Florida says is. California center business trade way Florida without tourism doesn’t exactly meet. Again.. world's largest military torched 4 entire countries 3000 people dying. think work 500k+ line. already COVID experienced second round.

Most vaccinations go like this: 1st vaccination - body goes ""hrmmm.."" thinks making antibodies shoulder hurts.

2nd vaccination - ""WE'RE ATTACK! BURN EVERYTHING DOWN! GET MUTHAFUCKING ANTIBODIES FRONT LINES! GRAAAAHHHH""

If COVID got primed already. luckily get second shot worse first. wear mask flu, measles, small pox, polio, mumps viruses vaccinated against. People seem lost sight fact vaccinated virus need live fear more. people need work, already worked, order survive. special. 

You know funny thing here. thing called Black Death. wiped ~60% population Europe. know happened this? People short supply effectively put place beginnings end feudal system. gave workers mobility move job job seeking better conditions pay. allowed people become specialized particular trades. sowed seeds renaissance centuries later industrial revolution. 

I digress essentially saying possibly worst pandemic history afforded amazing opportunity go find new job one currently fit expectations. 

Amazing think really right? Maybe EU take initiative build manufacturing infrastructure vaccines actually purchase vaccines instead bragging lockdown strategy maybe would along inoculation process back 3rd 4th lockdowns mad countries look either cruel, incompetent, poor vaccinating faster EU. Sitting around complaining pouting isn’t going solve problem. said that. ~50-60% starting protection. Dropping course months. using serum trial participants neutralization assay proving protection. Running clinical trial would show protection. done yet either ones ~50-60% protection. Logik Pfizer general pop. Moderna military people cant leave houses. unbelievable people expected everything run smoothly Trump's team took giant, steaming dump distribution process. Biden's team finally begun shovel dung people still freaking out. Give one goddamn minute set process. Good lord.

And we're currently giving 1.5M jabs day USA, number risen steadily every week. could giving expanded pool eligible people, raises ethical questions. I'm absolutely astonished quickly new team righted ship, due large part fact White House interfering. They're letting team actual experts figure out. Thank God 5000 Palestinians get vaccinated USA almost 3 times deaths per capita &amp; 4 times cases per capita compared Canada. India 1/5th deaths per capita 1/3rd cases per capita compared Canada.

Not saying due terrible planning &amp; response US government's part raw numbers appears it'd alleviate human suffering US vaccinate citizens India donating vaccines Canada. point effective safety measure shut isolate employees. No. Emphatically 100% no. Please check FAQ we've made vaccine, discusses topic. That's Oslo accord actually says, regardless superceded 4th Geneva convention hard lockdown states

I aware state ""hard lockdown"" ""masks, curfews, restrictions."" Yeah exactly, there's paper predicting exact thing. stop infections necessarily, massively neuter recirculation allow us keep antigenic drift, essentially allow reinfections act like slightly shit booster also theory happened another coronavirus, OC43. thought might caused 1889 Russia flu pandemic, similar symptoms Covid causes common cold. Honest question: way relevant Israelis vaccine developed Muslims Germany?
Are people go „I‘d rather get covid stuff injected!“?
Or non-issue? Well finish college hopefully don’t major liberal arts maybe potentially sacrificing both. Well, disagree I'd still take situation I'm described above. Also, Bidens call. States determine deaths hospitalizations low they'd probably ditch favor block/unfriend stupid people, unfollow shitty groups pages. got second shot today! There's shit ton stuff us save money on. Israel probably one them, spend us made stuff things money benefits us also even close country us aid think whould Afghanistan soon, people able get vaccine young people. young people break car analogy altogether minimal risk regardless reckless are. I’m curious long term health consequences. pandemic sentiment sanitize everything (especially regards children) body get used germs degree won’t get wrecked eventually get sick. Obviously past year hasn’t like that, mask go away colds going come back, wonder body going react getting cold long.  yes, point people shouldnt pander whole lives major social cultural shifts based diseases extremely risk tolerable vast majority people let country, people infected slip net. old white savior complex... immigrants/PoC agency, racist white liberals work. think gaps visible mirror wearer. see behind people it. properly fitted mask cave little every inhalation. taking vaccine prevent spread virus danger untrained medical professional taking care someone medically? 

Someone refuses vaccination untrained can't trusted medical care even care patients. people really dont understand many people take sneeze sign sickness either conscious/subconcious laziness level exageratted fear. hypochondria spreads like wildfire issue mask transmission effectiveness understudied terms relative impact

Someone definitely investigate company got from, point still stands headline misleading. does, far know. well. 

I expert. Yes. probably mildly annoying Australians, Victoria went though last year I'd bet ""annoying"" massive understatement Victorians feeling right now.

The virus keeps reintroduced state, taking battering it. received, day, unique treatment human planet COVID19 multiple experimental treatments available POTUS. many doctors attended him?

Then told let run life. Yes understand helpful. haven’t seen many people twisting ear loops I’m working around general public. lie go look data clearly see it? Voluntold. Australia? *worked* \- going pub evening, not! Imagine, going pub, seeing friends, great time, Covid! Kindof hard UK/EU USA allow shipments countries regions fully vaccinated. Yeah know makes mad saying true. never knew expect doctor know things rudimentary knowledge me. I'm trying throw stones here, obviously doctors nurses playing important role pandemic. I'm shocked big gaping hole extensive educations important areas human health. 

I see I'm one who's thinking since January 2020 arguing MDs refused acknowledge nCoV posed pandemic risk thought would *silly* prepare that. Yes, quickly edited comment checked responded quickly - correct, rule #2. certainly trying deceptive. Nah, real lesson beggars can't choosers. 

If Canada gonna go around begging vaccines one incompetent leaders, grateful third world vaccine. Christian missionaries genocides indigenous populations plague spreading. Name iconic duo. common knowledge.  German Health Ministry debunked research follow-up reignited issue. created [web expanded entire web site purely this. Maybe limos always carry blood bank incase get wreck president gets shot. That's good hear. many doses AstraZeneca vaccine Netherlands receive week next? COVID-19 elimination strategy preferred option context.

I agree this. funny many people originally said ""it's big deal stay open"" say ""it's late."" Reminds bit talking points global warming. real pessimists here? Sweden currently reporting almost twice many covid deaths excess death. ""You must miss making profits overlords. Masks underlings"".

Lol, Yep, I'm running right after, driving home, drinking lots water, throwing netflix. Fingers crossed! Cases lower UK per capita basis Spain, France Italy. Right? US never real lockdown. one would ever accept such. whine restaurants go takeout organize mass protests it. able leave home? People would start war. See October pal long vaccinated then, good go. admitting sick would admitting wrong. nope, can’t that. /s

i hope throw law books him. victim disease, condition... say victims cough, disease. times? good news!   like Africa

I'm hoping actually say what's wrong here. Might want fix 50 people comment one. list people getting vaccine kids sit? One assume there's groups coming them. That's opinion respect &lt;3 JJ single shot comparing apples apples saying virologist better grasp pandemic physicians. Physicians enormous heterogeneous group. Make comparison infectious disease specialist. Physicians also large group hear fringe voices, amplified media works. Takes special sort Evil sorts acts. government arrest throw away key. Dont inform us, dont need know, let rot, gave rights infringing less educated themselves. AstraZeneca promised deliver everything part “best effort” contract. AstraZeneca selling doses resellers already rather directly health care systems different countries, something really strange going on. report symptomatic asymptotic cases separately? Err.. data period though? yes it’s relevant. C'mon, false problem. Yes, issues start, daily routine tests extremely reliable. claims contrary come people purposefully try downplay pandemic. Prepare knock down. pleasantly surprised doesn’t. another one doctor full ppe crying phone saying ""there death ahead"". Also convinced real review positively they'll send newer one keep old one. would multiiple lockdowns required worked? Yes did. thought self-evident. Changing title allowed news subs rule one AFAIK. 

The CDC advice problematic (I know that, thanks) although others pointed people small heads going loose fitting masks *unless* perform trick.

I wish ""ear savers"" readily available. Plenty them. Even HIV, one arguably famous viruses property, think problem contain it? Good news, moot anyway, double masking moving KF94s. get adjustable ear loops work like charm That’s experiments lab seeing infected. Corinavirus shown animals outside minks handful exotic zoo animals year massive worldwide infection. 

It’s wrong say virus exists many animal species. thought AZ still produces T-Cell response South Africa variant? thing counting. want ample testing. Yeah, would also prefer three vaccines rolling review prioritized. personally would like see CureVac next Johnson Johnson since mRNA vaccine therefore effective, production capacity exclusive EU. worn even simple masks, together good handwashing protocols, large super spreading event becomes impossible.

this dubious claim best. Second shot today!!!! excited little nervous. grateful getting want mess running plans. covid would mess more! None taken. worry already much mistrust medicine narrative around physicians ill-informed understand viruses vaccines could create problems. Sorry overly aggressive response! Hello dear America, complete vaccination citizens, please help developing countries. Especiay Georgia possoble, please. Cause governmet full imbeciles capable accomplish anything. hear rainforest virus mated, gives chills. Took figure mikety son is. Redacted redacted.... UK bad comparison Europe? Spain lockdown cases surging...

I know variant hasn’t variant taken another European country? Could UK counting covid? There’s less 250 million eligible vaccines. Supply outpace demand soon enough, sine lot eligible simply won’t take time get it. good numbers effectiveness Sputnik?

What Chinese vaccine? don’t get it. There’s shame getting sick. shouldn’t dent anyone’s “tough-guy” image

You really get guy spent majority pandemic downplaying severity would pretend get sick? little tough-guy image fact proven wrong. pretty obvious point EU going purchase Sputnik, I'm sure even want EMA assess it. 

Usually I'd say assess vaccines regardless, since used member state (Hungary) speed EMA seems work at, time spent Sputnik could easily delay J&amp;J, Curevac Novavax approvals. Blame occupational hazard health care workers . infections dogs (10), cats (10–13), ferrets (10, 14), hamsters (15, 16), rhesus macaques (17), tree shrews (18), cynomolgus macaques (19), African green monkeys (20), common marmosets (21), rabbits (22), fruit bats (23) shown species susceptible SARS-CoV-2, experimentally infected cats, tree shrews, hamsters, ferrets could also transmit areas Brazil large proportion population already infected, slows propagation original virus, variant less affected immunity, propagate faster. Aliens next company, intermediary Dubai. 50% prepayment,” said.

So sounds like separate company Dubai trying take advantage situation selling AstraZeneca's vaccine obtained somewhere else world (assuming scam). sound like deal AstraZeneca, makes headline quite misleading. SA variant good damned reason.  goal post already moved? swear yesterday said “by” April. It’s important question... think one factors time placed bets, rightfully so, various options. remember maybe 6-9 months ago everyone high AZ/Oxford efficacious also likely approved soonest big bet placed that. Fast forward ended AZ/Oxford opposite, still good choice, effective MRNA, clinicals bit circus approval lagging behind many others. UK facilities isn’t particularly interested EU facilities.

So far UK mostly used Pfizer factories for. (As AZ productions ramps may change, Reviews excellent four vaccines. Moderna production, is. shared mRNA platform well predates Warp Speed coronavirus. believe exactly saying Oxford/Astrazeneca. get infection thus symptoms, replicating spread, they've seen trials, expected protect moderate severe Covid, evaluated trials (yet).

My take, blows away herd immunity vaccine solution, offers complexity role - suppose pressure open up, relax restrictions, blow vaccinated population. can't, won't, effective respect vaccine survive that, herd reached way, everyone breath bit easier (no pun intended). Well yeah. That’s true. I’ve sick needed get cough syrup, pickup prescriptions, pickup stuff like eat I’m sick. Killer Cuomo must held accountable murder!!! want vaccine, dont want wait line hours it. Im cool let frenzy die bit get one. achievement pretty incredible think it, say, went phone call vaccine produced scale less 10 months. world never seen anything remotely like that. like launching Mars rover millions lives line.

It true research mRNA vaccines goes back 5-10 years previous scares coronaviruses specifically helped lay ground work. still. crooked (but times, charming) smile, I'm always little self conscious get happy crack grin. remember father telling little posing pictures smile it.

Now mask, fear cracking grin. strange seems, liberating me. think, lot self-conscious quiet people like myself, mask ""freed"" us removing one aspect self-image worry about. it? vaccines currently out, progress well Warp Speed thing. mRNA platform ten years making, delivered like Dominos.

Meanwhile Warp Speed even make fucking plans vaccine rollout past ""jab old fucks liek crazy."" Credit unfucking response belongs Biden Fauci. Side effects dude much $10 per shot. AZ terrible efficacy - 70% apart SA variant - become dominant strain countries. viral vector vaccines changed quickly cater mutations. Well course. like 10 doctors looking him. regular citizen would probably dead right now. really seems like vaccines specifically target spike protein extremely tough virus evade vaccine like Oxford's that's similar flu vaccine easier mutated variants evade.

Does J&amp;J specifically target spike protein? also detected cats many times, much really even news anymore. Dogs less worrisome seem spread other. Honestly fact we're nearly year news organization still getting basic concept wrong tells never interest getting right.  Absolutely. whole variant thing phantom media created. reported crisis facts out. Dear USA. Leave vaccines us Europeans. Spain 60.000 doses administrated per day. Thanks False negatives much likely false positives kind test. Trump sick around. Fuck fuckin guy. point Biden buying doses people actually take year. No, Fauci told people wear cloth masks March entire Asia also it, suspicious all. Saying work suspicious. guess we'll wait April slow bureaucrats Brussels approves it. sympathy BREXIT grows every day! I'm happy Modi finally said record parliament stop demonizing private sector encourage wealth creation country. wealth redistribution, first need wealth redistribute. balls say socialist country like India took balls. guess we'll wait April slow bureaucrats Brussels approves it. sympathy BREXIT grows every day! know EU's fault. payback governments' strategy send worst politicians (like von der Leyen totally failed Minister Defense Germany).

It dumb pay more, considering even 10 times price much cheaper one day lockdown contract EU? didn’t see “notable rise” cases. proper way track trends deaths cases look seven day average case death reporting varies greatly day week. 2/10 2/11, seven day average cases deaths continued fall 48.2 minutes, plus minus 52 minutes give take fortnight less. Australia going lockdwon state is.

But one biggest sacrifices Australian lockdown. overseas travellers still stuck can't get back home due hotel quarantine caps. It’s vs Thursday last week 7-day average continues decline. saying necessarily nothing, chasing day-to-day fluctuations isn’t best due ebbs flows reporting throughout week.

Also, didn’t state (Ohio?) audit add many backlogged deaths? know NY Times flagged yesterday’s death count note many deaths unspecified days added yesterday. hope answers got link Well feel bad day ibuprofen able take day watch series movie time before

But there's still chance get fever Perfectly placed full stop!

For rest - clue .... notable rise cases all. Thursdays Fridays always highest numbers week, means nothing Thursday's number ""rise"" Wednesday.

Week week, numbers down. Thursday Feb 4 saw 124k cases. Thursday Feb 11 saw 103k. 17% drop consistent overall drop cases. notable rise cases all. Thursdays Fridays always highest numbers week, means nothing Thursday's number ""rise"" Wednesday.

Week week, numbers down. Thursday Feb 4 saw 124k cases. Thursday Feb 11 saw 103k. 17% drop consistent overall drop cases. ""people"", likely referring actual ""Australians"" trying get home better part year. cleaning temperature theater honestly waste time, resources focus. Social distancing, masking, ventilation what's important, people wash goddamn hands use bathroom happening even century pandemic. define ""defined""? difition ""is"" is? I'm Delhi, pretty popular ar groundlevele. Even people mention 'communism', still want state control. right. Cuomo gets awarded FL anything Desantis reamed - despite us much better. double standard obvious anyone looking. I'm liberal too. see conclude data dashboard. Especially part: Since Israel's latest peak mid-January, cases among people aged 60 years older declined 55%; hospitalizations declined 40%; critical illnesses, 35%; deaths, 35%, Segal said. trends present people younger 60, began vaccinated later. said, wait peer reviewed data makes feel better, right. Clearly statements made health ministers worthless. Yeah, next week Canada seriously ramp vaccine distribution. That's Pfizer alone. 116-year-old French nun, believed oldest person Europe, beat COVID-19 time 117th birthday Thursday, February 11.

Sister André, born Lucile Randon, tested positive COVID-19 retirement home city Toulon southern France January 16, reported local news agency Var-Martin (in French), first spread news.

She quickly isolated fellow residents, remained asymptomatic throughout illness, stating Var-Martin even know COVID-19.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* According speculation recognising Armenian genocide. Nah, people family abroad become borderline criminals also fridge-storable mRNA far. Oh shit! got Pfizer vaccine yesterday morning! benefit greater cost. Opening anytime soon would cost billions - bad deal. initial Johns Hopkins data showed fewer 100,000 new COVID-19 cases nationally Wednesday, marked fourth straight day threshold. rise deaths cases came day President Joe Biden announced U.S. government secured another 200 million doses effort get people access vaccine end summer. Biden meet White House group governors mayors discuss proposed $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, advancing Congress. Great news! got second shot Wednesday, get yours! thinking I'm paramedic. Uh, think kink last one. Yes. EU finally seems understood that. theory. still testing positive. science suggests viral load pretty low 10 days symptoms start may contagious others (depends long hospital symptoms started). Typically infected care homes obviously places already outbreak also. Comrade: companion shares one's activities fellow member organization.

so English clearly first language yore spouting russian propaganda, get weird amount votes point make sense.


Gee wonder part russias internet propaganda arm. Trump known germaphobe though? I'm sure people like sick extremely mentally distressing easier denial. I've read somewhere Pfizer, Moderna Janssen vaccines use kind spike protein, AstraZeneca vaccines uses slightly different one somehow makes less effective South African variant. that's true, would mean Moderna Janssen vaccines likely Pfizer protect new variants? doesn't. sentence literally says ""blacks whites"". reveal shit. people sick. First is? hell going here? really isn't. 

I idea looking for, think ""nothing changes"" specific enough not? No, seems lot still learn intubated. fact Moderna going short known week, it’s reduced shipments every country except USA (since USA relies different supply chain) month due issues sourcing components tries scale production Switzerland. 

Moderna still reassuring Canada hit Q1 target. people ever learn properly wear masks? Great news! Get vaccine, folks Misinformation? Haha sure buddy.
They aren’t comparable. either domestic production using Chinese vaccine. Canada doesn’t magic wand create domestic production aren’t going use Chinese vaccine. aren’t comparable. Canada fine don’t get stressed excited hope know everything going right rollout US result things happened Trump's tenure. year last year ive sayingim grateful im us right ugh want vaccine fucking country wants vaccine rolled 2023 corrupt pieces shit tryna make money everytime opportunity fuck hope going forward, countries latch onto lockdowns cure-all disease

This greatest fear. live days two hour prime delivery, society become. EU started review......that lead approval oh December.  They're comparable - want live denial, fine. Go right ahead. Go tell NY Times Canada 'special' can't compared countries list.

That's enough misinformation btw, comment reported. claims tim rich countries isolate poor countries remain vulnerable COVID eliminated poor countries. pretty much political propaganda. Honestly dont care fared. Hes longer President doesnt matter.  thinking that, flu shots winter went drive-through setup five minutes. could outdoor walkups parking lots outside pharmacies, safe everyone wears masks. Wouldn’t word “hoarding” apply vaccines don’t need? ""Right-to-work laws aim provide general [guarantee people seeking work, rather government ban contractual agreements employers union employees requiring workers pay costs union representation.""

I hate practice moralizing names laws sell public. Ontario, we’re currently coming pretty quickly second wave spike (about 3800 cases day early January, 1100 cases day). However, new government modelling saying there’s likely “huge third wave spike” April variants become dominant strains Covid. worried this? getting “things essentially get better cases going down/spring coming/more vaccines coming”, I’m feeling doom gloom. I’m sure it’s media trying get people stay cautious it’s legit thing maybe stay lockdown another month help prevent it. excited non-essential retail open weeks it’ll prevent whole mess wait bit longer... Reddit nutshell Lol...

ok chief👍 wasn’t clear wrote. contagious. You’re virus feel fine still test positive. continue 12 weeks. Moderna also got slashed yesterday....embarrassing af. 

**Canada short 82,000 doses next shipment Moderna COVID-19 interesting thing J&amp;J vaccine also efficacy increased time: “Efficacy severe disease increased time cases vaccinated participants reported day 49” understand, thought one come leave America currently? domestic flights coming going? I'm sorry dumb question something assumed. variants around world popping America seems really odd me. honestly interstate travel stop get control endorsement? I’m well aware this. None places comparable. guess can’t read close herd immunity.

A lot normal, nice, hopeful, everyday people hoping we're close herd immunity.

A lot normal, nice, hopeful, everyday people wish close herd immunity.

But aren't.

Just drop it. Please. shall see, place here, one day it’s like 20k vaccines done, following day it’s 2k done, need consistent numbers, need pushing 30-40k day. Joe Biden said logistical hurdles means everyone vaccinated Right? glad US sticking science tested trials. already enough doubt people vaccines. disease different ones. like left 30% sufferers long term symptoms. Covid related long hauler, blood clots organ damage [scientific want ignore facts pretend like happening go ahead. Call fear mongerer whatever. I'm realistic stating facts choosing ignore. reality, pretending like something exist make go away. Sorry..I said they’ll recommend lifting instead.

Can answer that? u/PedroDaGr8 good explanation better zinc. good. People won’t even entertain theory ridiculous. There’s possibility transmission advantage involved, epidemiology absolutely subject stochastic effects. one group friends got B117 version went ten parties infected fifteen people relatively low-incidence areas, would quickly balloon several major regional outbreaks. Random chance definitely drive balance versions virus. numbers cited rookie numbers, except comedian's. People spend month ICU probably look least $1 bills. Then, even they're insured, anyone's guess covered providers in-network ones weren't. 
The beauty for-profit healthcare. That's understandable. Years ago, mild reaction took vaccine Yellow Fever. still worth it.

I think history allergic reactions vaccines, talk doctor first. long clear mean vaccine safe general. vaccines among safest effective scientists ever produced (like mentioned article video). Based though? We've barely time test immunity mRNA vaccines general. Maybe old person could true. young healthy person, immune system able adapt. trust millions years evolution saying thing: Headspace = air filled bottle. 

It means reuse manufacturing equipment, increase efficiency(less time per dose) decrease per dose cost. 

That said, likely use equipment, slam dunk. case care, discuss detail risks Moderna mitigate [in another thread. Yes, one hesitates draw parallels, course, but... societies earth ought know dangers consequences making maintaining lists citizens shall treated differently, would them.  back September I'm cool getting J&amp;J saving Moderna someone higher risk I. supply though issue? remember Eu huge argument AZ cut supply. supplies low really much tbh. Suck that, Gina Carano Surely human rights violations going here? China didn’t bat eye got broadly upvoted scientifically shaky statement. Getting couple people disagreeing doesn’t warrant whining threads couple I've back since August. need guidance, need grace. 

I'm working harder ever have. Hybrid model stretched thin supporting students front ones me. like expecting grocery store employees work register also delivering InstaCart orders. reading specialist, I'm ""lucky"" sense classes pretty small, students also need much support. Since reading intervention designed done virtually I've pretty much completely adapt whole program. Every single minute schedule packed, less time. go education watch kids fail, yet I'm still seeing kids make growth wish could. then, day finally done, go online get hit barrage teacher bashing. 

I think I'm better worker see leaving anytime soon I'm really good do, dang hard punching bag. Based this, end sight. someone farts, might carry virus across room infect someone. Seriously though, end-game metric UK going use determine deem safe everyone return normal? We're supposed go July wedding UK US doubt happening. Natural immunity comes IgA antibodies—which decrease chance infected person transmit virus another—as well IgG antibodies prevent severe systemic infection. Vaccine good IgG, experts believe elicit IgA response. International travel depend alot countries decide. I'm expecting International travel resume normality late summer end year. Internally normality come along early summer earlier Companies direct investments according earning potential. see mRNA technology winning ticket, they'll invest mRNA vaccines. technology still infancy see reason used vaccines. all, primarily developed cancer therapy far. current boost investment undoubtedly bring 2nd generation improved mRNA vaccines fairly rapidly. also direct route producing target require introduction DNA cell nucleus. hubby I. 

We'll wait Johnson Johnson's vaccine thank much. scary part big unknown Novavax Phase 3 Placebo group South Africa, proportion people gotten covid evidence covid never gotten before. implies (though probably see J&amp;J’s full SA data well) natural immunity infection useless different variants, would put us LOT behind think evidence far points slightly towards opposite. weak draw conclusion though. kind side effects worried about? Side effects like fever, chills, fatigue etc signs vaccine working immune system. worried unknown long-term side effects, different conversation. included clinical trials (this one any) ethics reasons, despite that, pregnant breastfeeding women taking it, doctors found reasons shouldn't. :) post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

""we call back"". may get one month still inked.

I wonder WV miniature UK style vaccine roll overwhelmed second shot demand..... CDC decide advise fir sure end day political decision politicians US means individual states policies place. decisions probably made many overall population vaccinated, many vulnerable/elderly vaccinated busy hospitals. ruling possibility UK would R(t) 0.67 environment without variant? Hawaii it.. inside airport.

negative test, quarantine, go back home.

airlines necessary. Put oxygen mask helping others. winter. took 20.000IE week since Oct. based last years regime doctor tested Jan lower end target range. Everyone different much throw blood values. Chances us living northern parts right values low. study answers wrong question. think C Zinc cure you, barking wrong tree. used maintain healthier immune system. study infection rate among groups people actively taking supplements vs control group IMO.

“I research, found vaccines safe effective” antibodies breast milk get absorbed baby, stays gut impact child. 

""In humans, gut closure occurs precociously, breast milk antibodies enter neonatal/infant Variant fever mostly media phenomenon. News orgs hype people hear viral variation first thing pops mind immune escape, even though evidence even hypothetical variation SARS-CoV-2 could escape immunity exists. raises specter doomsday keeps people clicking make sure still hasn’t happened. 20-22% population 16, currently ineligible vaccine. think lot businesses, less customers = less revenue = cut hours, really anything malicious illogical businesses' part. agree counter-intuitive comes governor mandates closing bars/restaurants early. COVID wait till 10 PM start spreading, people want go drinking Friday night four hours instead eight, bars going packed Good question. know case anecdotal, parents registered hospital well county (many many weeks ago first opened registrations) Walgreens.

They call daily check get answer - doses currently available going 2nd shots keep checking back new doses available.

It's extremely frustrating especially people keep saying ""WV great!"" Well stevo fucking lawyer Thanks confuse  Yeah totally agree there. excuse always great job setting trials quickly it’s somehow reasonable weren’t able get regular testing program established.

But it’s even leading people know responsible social distancing masking want get vaccinated. They’ll say something like “I’m young healthy, would bother get vaccine still infect others anyway?” Neither give shit workers. Target done analysis decided publicity worth cost (which probably comes advertising budget) Walmart's analysis stated opposite. delay things 1 month time people get second shots? (I hoping reopen soon possible) He’s talking politically. 

Otherwise mean ‘geographically’ count Russia, ignore places like Canaries Spain continent. Ireland first. Biden didn’t give martial law lockdown wanted though. think also, US UK coming peak. Hell county 75% 7 day average, told mostly vaccine yet. And, least see restaurants 100% (reduced) capacity, 20 30 people inside room eating without mask. Everyone limit going give caring restrictions, maybe now, maybe month number half currently are, maybe 3 months numbers even lower people know getting vaccine already gotten it. 30% people US immunity virus probably 30 40% people vaccinated time. course overlap two groups totally done pretty much done rapid spread Yay! get shittiest vaccine, aside maybe Russian one Chinese one, get wait even longer it! 1. Stimulus would $5-10k month 2 years 

2. iranian USA spookily heading towards path Iran taking  companies pay employees it? Multiple vaccines exist, keep hearing stronger strains, death tally still goes up. keep moving goalposts future keeps getting brighter every day. Helps make fewer expected Q1 guess. &amp;#x200B;

the problem solves itself.

**Walmart Sam’s Club Pharmacies Administer COVID-19 Vaccines Federal Retail Pharmacy According White House announcement yesterday enough doses everyone Yeah we're close means we're going relatively small rolling epidemics case lot illnesses. That's likely model outcome entirely go away longer major threat society large. We'll see things two three months. suspect different place Natural immunity 70-90%. Full vaccination 95%. Vaccination without second shot yet 2/3 week ~90% second shot scheduled. Using natural immunity first shot stacking one vaccine shot likely ie vaccine infection history. God bless sir Perhaps read article first attempt add ""logic"" it. one knows exactly efficient since actual trials done SA variant. IIRC moderna said lab research shows still efficient SA variant. probably reduced efficiency still offer level protection. would get vaccines available ASAP. game, people's mental economic well-being, shitting average people

We went four (or five? legitimately remember) month full lockdown. think bit right opinion something went longest strictest lockdowns PLANET. June? Ah, yea, I’m sure kept germs guests too. lol Someone say drop bucket. C north.
    h
    i
    l
    e Yes, that's says....but actions match.... people stupid. epidemiologists saying may never herd immunity, even vaccination programmes complete. bonkers entertain idea then. Sorry, exasperating. take upper limit false negative rates @ ~30%, would 2.7% chance three false negatives.  Vaccination way reopen schools safely. Everyone knows young children won’t able wear masks consistently, stay distanced wash hands regularly. 

Visit playground see proof.  didn’t mean you. joking quote downplaying guests infected employees. 

Sorry wasn’t clear. approach herd immunity June. Whether technically get open question close. likely outcome relatively low amounts spread winters minimal spread summers long run. Yes. Britain sail middle Atlantic left EU. says doesn’t believe virus exists, all??? Everyone basically already got seems. Bars, grocery stores, gyms, restaurants packed lately Yeah related vaccines probably due reduced spread fewer holidays etc. also suspect many people going lot already gotten virus beginning learn people pretty good perfect immunity reinfection this. venting here. grandpa got Covid died morning. diagnosed stomach cancer, lung cancer past. almost done chemo taken hospital dehydration, got Covid diagnosis. Lasted 6 days.

I really think would beaten virus undergone chemo. received doses vaccine as. suspect chemo old immune system strength respond vaccine properly. There's data though, vaccine trials test healthy people. dont blame vaccine. think it, would better put chemo vaccinated. Strangely, doctors said pneumonia disagreed. became obvious quickly palliative care wya forward moot point. There's lot traveling within US though.  get point, end day, guess expect cousin better informed 2 70somethings one making choices travel back forth, take precautions, bother getting tested, etc.

It's ""never see parents again"" ""infect parents COVID,"" could stayed hotel saw outdoors, gotten tested quarantined seeing them, plenty safe options could considered. Yes thing restrictions removed come flying back terms infection rates. However lots places relatively restrictions like Dakota's case rates still pretty low right now. Lowest North Dakota think since July early August. Although relatively little spread early despite relatively restrictions lack density helps. doubt PHAC wait US Novavax trial, precedent isn’t set waiting US AZ trial. I’m personally leaning towards Novavax approved early-mid April since J&amp;J likely approved March EMA Canada likely approve around time them. Biden said lot things like 2k checks, don’t believe everything politician says hope wrong sure hell freedom. now, accept it. Winter many vulnerable vaccinated. soon get active try convince people etc effected theory getting vaccines US well complaining Europeans even Canadians complaining 1. Social Distancing
  - Kids break rule constantly
  - majority classrooms small space kids. They'd lucky get 3 ft apart fit desks schools.
  - sure seen normal school hallway sort room change, wall wall flesh. schools operate well designed capacity designed capacity certainly account social distancing
2. Ventilation
  - schools several windowless interior rooms
  - school HVAC systems antiquated meet covid requirements air moved (return air one room becomes register air others without adequate filtration)
  - schools use boiler heat radiators instead forced air, providing ventilation (some low-income districts cooler climates even AC).
3. Masking
  - Kids get belief system parents polling know least 5% American adults refuse wear mask (the polling numbers actually 8%) 25% would go without mask required wear one (this inclusive refusers). going lot angsty anti-maskers.
  - Kids angsty even ones believe masks probably rebel point (YOLO).
  - Kids kinda dumb, improper mask use improper masks also like sudden mistrust cdc intentions goes narrative

Sudden? ask SE Asian masks effective SARS MERS coronavirus Covid would look like dumbest motherfucker ever met. covid they'd probably telling even questioning mask wearing. course masks effective, need research prove it, concrete fact day 1 pandemic. second health care official told people need wear masks, lost credibility me. They're either stupid willing lie public fulfill objective. 

The reason say thing would stop panic buying could supply health care workers masks appropriate way accomplish use power government appropriate supplies rather lie people it. 

I want tell face opening schools provide child care people get back work think fewer kids die covid coming economic downturn hoping avoid opening schools. think they're wrong, think long term health effects childhood covid infection worse effects keeping schools closed kids vaccinated. think waiting vaccinate kids studies done worse putting wave 1d whatever next number (because can't bear tell someone they're wave 1) preventing cases covid vs infinitesimally small risk vaccines somehow safe 16 year olds deadly 6 year olds. absolutely reason believe vaccine prevents contraction disease also prevent transmission. simply haven’t proven yet. continuing harp masks even vaccinated people people don’t start lying vaccinated. Personally think that’s bad strategy removes incentive actually get vaccinated. one two brain cells rub together actually believes vaccines weird twist fate prevent contracting virus transmitting it. saying anything myself. admit may stupid iq 100. I'm running country, I'm allowed to. available today. claimed indication virus originated Wuhan lab yet CCP refused give data.... might proving point IGA sterilizing maybe problem people losing 2 3 months even natural infection Except people go USA Mexico somewhat freely. example, know someone went Mexico self quarantine exposed. know people consistently traveling back forth. Australia, it’s lot harder cross border swim Australia. 

And asked eradication life back normal, less deaths. rolling review months though, I’m sure mean final product? PHAC mentioned AZ likely approved next week per mid-February timeline. vaccines us. talking UK. THIS! problem. great theory, practice doesn’t work well. 

I want kids back school that’s what’s best ASAP there’s masks markings floor. wanna see small metal bands again🥺  Medway would tell different.

Do think anything lockdown?

Your analysis is, British terms, bollocks. average person also stupid. proved point there. huge overlap error bars two vaccines. sure say statistically same, extremely damn similar. Sheesh! called Casper? saying follow scientific experts? exactly, didn’t much slow spread. want eradicate covid, let back in, need 2 years lockdown $5-10k month stimulus. remote island also helps. Well, continent Australia island, US pretty much close one well. said, Great Britain Ireland islands, Spain Italy peninsulas.

Now, six hours shot, feel fatigued, slight headache. Nothing can't handle, especially reading article. hypertension overweight, peace mind brings me, figuratively feeling like loaded gun pointed head months, makes much better. Hasn’t even year, stfu ‘lifelong effects’. read headlines make internet people angry significantly smaller viral load. problem, seemed bit given complexity detail answer, sorry seemed rude. “Competent clear” aka full lockdowns. Let’s kid ourselves.

Nothing short full lockdown works. That’s Australia too. I’m going lie say doesn’t work... it’s draconian hell details contractual obligations cite them

You purposefully deceptive. 

Both vaccine manufacturers updated vaccine schedule deliveries Q2 still big blank empty weeks Q1?

Could Pfizer Moderna feasibly deliver 2.7 million doses last two weeks March? I'm 98% confident could stop deliveries US meet commitment. 

Even met commitment, would Canada put them! We'd 300,000 vials vaccine refrigeration capacity.  We'd innoculate 502,000 Canadians every day week nothing go waste. 

You better prepared cite sources longer sub MODs going remove posts even support post links first shot Oxford vaccine fucked real good. Felt like severe flu bones, muscles joints aching. Fever chills, headache. lot.

It lasted day though. Pounded bottles gatorade bed felt 100% next morning except pain injection site. side effects good thing, surely agree would happier didn’t feel like crap 2 days. YES proof vaccine working, good thing. means Moderna cautious take change seriously -- disagreement there. we're already trusting Moderna act like competent adults. Surely trust continue monitoring product bottle filled?

In words, none excuse allow thousands die waiting FDA approval. read weeks ago, 6th dose unexpected bonus discovered field.

A single mRNA vaccine natural infecrion, however, shown elicit absurd amounts neutralization even cross neutralization SARS freakin' CoV-1, studies people show proof full (2 dose) vaccination? I'd take AZ vaccine without second thought worry. Like freedom businesses get allow people inside risk establishment customers? kind freedom choice? sure. pros cons. want get JJ vaccine find line can't get mRNA one it. I'm willing risk summer months, knowing everyone else is. I've house almost year point. wait months. CDC estimates 83 None cooks work wear face shields (somewhat understandable), even masks, surprising. current, well previous employers pay transportation costs get home work. also pay khaki pants (not company branded wear everywhere).

You need find better companies work won’t end bitter it. Fuck government. Bunch incompetent morons keep blaming other. hate living country much. might even able go hockey games next year too.

Which sounds pretty flippin sweet me. vaccine fights virus though. 

It makes immune system think virus fight. power immune system work still, forcing think Covid present needs fight it. 

Maybe right, People Covid may immune little need vaccine studies know extent vaccines option see much wrong attempting everything return world back normal, even means potentially administering unnecessary vaccines. 

In France roughly 3.5m people diagnosed Covid population 67m. 

3.5m booster vaccines seem excessive compared scale everything happened last year. second moderna shot recently. Besides sore arm, fever (topping 102.6), chills, headaches, fatigue. Overall, side-effects lasted 36ish hours. Day 3 shot completely recovered returned normal. 

It pleasant day half, would without hesitation means I'll protected. small price pay. idea. I'm holding breath approvals February, possible. think Novavax reason approved later others. guess we'll see approvals March. US approves us, we're bound follow. anybody information true number Covid infections United States? know higher confirmed number, I'm sure much. agree. wondering lines supply increase vs. demand falloff meet. find hard see getting 3.2m-ish myself. like thinking Come Florida. covid restrictions wearing mask indoors since last summer. What? read watch video? Social distancing one. true.

My child misbehaving virtual school today. husband trying figure approach it, like “well he’s hell us around 3 people year never separated!” knew wasn’t recent behavior, I’m feeling great myself! 
Luckily school person option starting next month. trying help cope feelings punish natural reaction isolated. 
I even imagine sort hell would us didn’t like other. is, marriage therapy thick completely implode. mom got COVID vaccine reservation Sunday! Bless gentleman stayed phone 20 minutes refreshing NY. 

I breathe deep, deep sigh relief knowing ~ 2 months she’ll totally vaccinated! Yea don’t get sub. keep acting like they’re gonna big changes society. flu level deaths one gonna give one shit go lives seems reasonable! Lucky. may wait till summer get shot see family. almost 2 years since I've seen them. feel good all, great partner side help this. ain't easy that's sure. Right also possible organ damage detected pops later. running full diagnostics every single kid country might something.  able get 37? state still vaccinating anyone younger 65. That's really wear masks though sick. 
I fully agree fix fact companies letting stay home sick....but think better chance wearing masks google apple etc giving people sick time. mention much. get sick week probably used like half days right there. 

As much wish it, memes people make bosses making come work anyway true. situation US June-August look like? wonder lag time obtaining 600mill using them. mean... government doesn’t exactly stellar track record comes sort thing. think effective method would educate, inform, require vaccinations certain things like attending public school, etc. looks like starting plateau cases dropping last days session 5 days week since August. Wearing mask common sense backed science. still go work. Still work out. Still take car canyons. live life. adjusted pandemic passes. Go complain somewhere else comment never mentioned anything lockdowns inserting frustrations lockdowns somebody care lol. shut lol take shit somewhere else. Nice chatting you, great day! study shows percentages people willing get reluctant. believable. divide Okay, issue argument. pointing calling anecdotal actually quite scientific. think amount preparation could convince Americans wear masks rate people countries. know kind stupid ask vaccine information internet, think sinovac efficiency? chose send school knew risk. There's nothing surprising here; put risk. Thats radiologist clinics texas agree on

Moderna starting 12-17 trial. I'd surprised Pfizer already working 12-15 one. I'd prefer conventional one-shot vaccine, thanks.  People dream coming live Canada. Sure, beautiful country certainly perks, healthcare system complete shambles many places. People waiting YEARS get family doctors, waiting months years surgeries waiting hours seen ER hospitals packed seniors basically live enough long term care facilities them.  


Just today, live, notice went public ambulances available, chances are, stuck patients waiting rooms hallways could seen doctor. Fuck health care system. 7 day average cases 3,000. Hospitalizations nearly 3,000 too. good point. Convincing everyone get board way every rule, regulation even law works. half population loses faith disregards government really do?  asked? That's meaning ask, maybe come way. know efficacy rates good. asking still transmit disease vaccine. carrier? maybe know right terms. 

Do know clarified. carrier vaccination. masks socially distance indefinitely. Please dont shoot internet big chance one variants actually puts us back square 1 look seven day moving average. Deaths compared last Thursday overall it’s trending well. means we're way past midpoint garbage times. law? mandatory vaccinations relation second statement?

What’s stop now? 

Big scary statement that’s worth nothing. Typical nonsense anyone skeptical mandatory vaccinations (not that’s you) think kids vaccinated soon, think even adults get vaccine want much protect kids may involve continuing wear masks social distancing foreseeable future. Like everything COVID-19 related, studies going take time we'll know know. Darn novel viruses. empty... would biased selective requirement sufficient data. Right, data also indicates allow spread uncontained cause massive societal disaster overwhelming hospital services leading downriver deaths sorts things covid mass panic, also still determined there's long-term risk virus, even people mild symptoms. 

Again, people can't take anecdote say concerned without rationalize versus data poured every expert planet solid year come consensus something taken likely.

this essentially think argument incredibly naive. think angle whether somebody certain age probably survive covid. even take account people young without comorbidities contract covelid still help spread people significantly higher risk. fuck could proof long lasting covid damage point, Alice? always way?

Every day pandemic wasted time costs double work. Yeah never stop selling name seems legit 😂 fact likely done almost entirely MRNA. I'm expecting much J&amp;J US honest despite order Alright let's wait 20 years then. 
 
Oh wait can't, bummer Antarctica FAR bigger California almost cases whatsoever.

/s suppose think earth single planet? We'll send anti vaxxers want. sure correct I’m wrong. article states 200 million doses “sufficient shots cover everyone currently eligible inoculation end July.” group 1b currently. 300 million people states. People require two doses. It’s enough 1/3 Americans, seems. Thanks. check out. Great news. population 18 200 million, that’s great news! (I know moderna Pfizer 16 17 year olds) hahahahaha apologies Great, go get mine now. argument vast majority cases severe symptoms. Something guy said dismissed anecdotal evidence. No, data. data look confirmed cases even moreso consider US cases believed three times many confirmed.

Now, disagree argument? responded him, reasonable question. one irresponsible moments I've seen politician ever. I'm certain many people got sick comments believing serious. fact, he's offering special bonus every tourist arrival:

Or maybe random corpses find street corner. Whatever. there's two people enough food water one let one die. ration. R.A.T.I.O.N. One person, one shot. Everyone gets second there's enough hand later. That’s nice little generalization keep thinking that. Exactly. There's medical end pandemic social end. I'm hoping social end comes sooner rather later. friend made half dozen appointments old non tech savvy people knows. tries convince rest us lazy though one us parents. Unfortunately without NHS America health infrastructure help old poor. replace them? You? Since it’s simple. hallway least end summer.

Thanks revealing open discussing reasonable solutions.  Read article. tourists evacuated, “the entire city”. test everyone Da Nang though pretty impressive. mention 35 people died whole country, economy well people don’t even wear masks indoors. I’m sensing jealousy lol. Sorry downvoted much, got absolutely reasonable response.

My wife precarious situation supporting in-laws also rather heavy debt, without much wiggle room money, can't stop working. Therefore, need in-laws watch kids, in-laws high risk yet unvaccinated (slow rollout MA). people put risk immediate family, kids would sleepovers everything else. cavalier people's lives, ones risk. looks though may spelled ""Chick-fil-A"" incorrectly. worries, happens best us! people mild cases get mild second time get stronger antibody response. Others vaccinated easily clear virus. I’ll tell corporation could administer vaccines efficiently army entity: Chik-fil-A really related convo, always think Canada people talk population density. higher percentage Canadians live populous six metros Americans US' populous six metros.

So technically US higher population density, really describe reality Canada really nearly many medium small towns.  kinda side said 'unpproven junk'.  
You know, vaccine took 1 year research develop mean going give third arm.  
R&amp;D increased tremendously past 30 years, reason can't use kinds diseases there's basically cap world economy Covid particular, best interest many world enterprises goes away fast possible.  y’all please stop labeling people aren’t willing get brand NEW covid-19 vaccine anti-vaxxers? argument global health community incorrect grave threat requires actions we've taking try contain it?

Sahin seems like person reads papers non-stop, researcher fundamentals. oncology believes mRNA solution he's founded Biontech get $$$ photo provided Keoki Fraser, small group kindergarteners sits spaced apart classroom Aikahi Elementary School Kailua, Hawaii. paper published journal PLOS Computational Biology Thursday modeling household outbreaks Israel indicates kids much less likely pass Covid-19 adults. Ludvigsson nevertheless noted cancer infected children Sweden three times rate Covid-19 last year kids died traffic accidents pandemic. get Bezos, Prime convenient practically infectious.  Alot European countries we're hit much harder Canada. look deaths per capita high cases gotten European countries hospitlisations increased dramatically. think UK hospitlisations reached almost double first wave already bad enough. France seeing 50k cases one point Germany reaching 1,000 deaths. Germany example really struggled second wave compared first. first opted lighter lockdown UK/France November non essential retail remaining open really work tightened lockdown mid December IIRC closing non essential retail. 

My guess they're alot cautious avoid needing restrictions future. I'm assuming UK waiting immunity kick vaccines since course immunity build straight away think they're going give outline plan ease lockdown restrictions later month.  like April. I’ll never understand accept argument. “Other bad things happen time, accept covid life.” No. That’s reply that. Just, no. open hit herd Front line workers (retail, grocery stores, restaurants) need put higher priority list people getting vaccine. sorcery?! Well, engineers work home, can't work poorly ventilated room serving glorified babysitter 25 kids, yeah, vaccinated. Also, severity infections correlates viral load, even young healthcare workers first priority Cases like 75 percent CA. Panic!!!!! Article states US receiving 11M doses week. Given can’t vaccinate doses receive, limited supply 11M week. hard understand that?

However, seem Biden signed deal Moderna Pfizer today receive another 200M doses end July, means US given priority doses might getting doses expected. right constrained based information hand. I’m physically disabled live young healthy people lying move vaccine queue getting appointment hook ups friends work medical field. patiently waiting turn danger. zero Covid people need shut already. get mid spring we’re going risk reduction model. Considering overwhelming evidence saying otherwise, isn’t quite defence think is. know bit hesitant J&amp;J's initial PIII efficacy numbers be.

""It happened big deal"" classical bad logic trap reason. also mutation could happen makes dangerous kids Ok...so like said, situation referring patients isnt correct since likely hundreds thousands patients, 660. Buying would supporting dictatorship. Korean pharmaceutical biotech companies rushing develop Covid-19 treatment using natural ingredients.

They aggressively conducting trials, particularly India, country many Covid-19 cases high unmet clinical needs.

Last year, India eased drug regulations nation’s traditional medicine Ayurveda promote Covid-19 treatment development. deregulation raised chance win approval natural ingredient-based drugs.

Video game developer Dragonfly biotech venture APRG agreed collaborate developing Covid-19 treatment based APRG64, extract Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb Rhus chinensis Mil fruit. Dragonfly’s largest shareholder Syswork, subsidiary diagnostic kit maker BBB.

APRG lead clinical trials R&amp;D, Dragonfly raise funds new drug development commercialize medicine.

In October, APRG nod India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) conduct phase-1 study APRG64. two companies plan complete phase-1 trial April conduct phase-2 phase-3 trials simultaneously May.

APRG got APRG64 technology transfer Kyunghee University’s Biomedical Research Institute (BMRI) August formed consortium Genencell, Korea Medicine Research Institute, Korea Pharma new drug development.

Korea Pharma produce clinical samples APRG64, Genencell lead phase-1 study, APRG lead phase-2 phase-3 trials.

Separate consortium, Genencell working another Covid-19 treatment using natural substances.

After licensing-in shingles treatment candidate ES16001 BMRI 2017, Genencell tests clinical study develop Covid-19 drug. Genencell completed phase-2 research candidate treatment preparing global phase-3 trial. company plans seek India’s approval Ayurveda drug. Korea Pharma manufacture clinical samples.

Helixmith also planning conduct clinical trial traditional medicine India develop TADIOS, respiratory disease treatment candidate, Covid-19 drug ingredients derived natural substances.

Helixmith evaluate whether TADIOS used adjuvant therapy 100 patients mild severe Covid-19 infection.

The clinical trial conducted following Ministry AYUSH regulations, India's traditional medicine regulatory body, company said.

In April, India relaxed regulations traditional medicine licenses permitted clinical trials natural ingredient-derived drugs Covid-19 treatment. Depending results single clinical study, possible obtain functional food approval.

Helixmith completed submission documents “Ethics Committee (EC),” clinical trial review committee India. company passes EC review, start clinical trial immediately.

If company gets positive data trial, explore possibility winning license traditional medicine India neighboring countries, said. Simple - social distancing measures also played part, along culture obsessively cleaning sanitizing every surface prevent spread aerosolized virus... luckily measures much effective stopping spread flu virus. neutered capability jump person person, hence flu cases plummeted. expect several years low flu case numbers since take time flu proliferate previous levels even corona prevention measures ended. ah yes, silver lining people die fucking much Kids also died hundreds things. children passed away pool accidents last year Covid. It’s awful, lived everyday COVID. sure you’re downvoted major brigading going sub lately. vaccinate enough people October think might open borders?   expert opinions wetness water? would want children vaccinated covid lol... OK, math.

For 2018-2019 flu season CFR 3.4/100kin &lt;17 year old age bracket. COVID currently 3.2/100k.

Add fact COVID much deadly older population makes sense proactive control.

my 2 cents. Fake masks bad, guess point risk vaccinated healthcare employee even without mask orders magnitude less risk customer facing essential workers. Thanks :) Great, give Germany.

No, seriously. rate we'll done vaccinating everyone five years according estimates.

Please? think AP needs meeting Reuters. Right okay said so. like little paper mask it’s going protect corona. replace ""kids"" ""you."" negatively affecting around you. We’ll really rocking July Canada could brought Medicago + cash considerations mix exchange finished vaccines. OWS money, Medicago would likely timeline NovaVax. I'm sure people ""toughing out"" going work means losing jobs going hungry becoming homeless. That's happened Trump. He's narcissist couldn't/wouldn't admit weakness. Mother Nature job Yes huge risk children. Believe science /s feel like reaction almost every vaccine article past two months been: ""That's great...now hurry up."" didn’t answer question.  seems pretty awesome? bigger deal happening July. Initially read supposed end August Seems sub 1000000 different rules give FING BREak Kids died covid. Parents strong desire protect children. get year school, long life health. That’s they’re thinking. they’re right. want get chest.

Both mom's parents passed away pandemic I've living home her. incredibly hard going grieving process cooped home across country rest family. Saying goodbye FaceTime hurts much. know support mom right now. virus lethal enough, government mandates would unnecessary. Yeah Idk Reuters article. 300m inoculations July approved vaccines likely even J&amp;J Novavax means enough. fact, contract tracker shows enough vaccine 200% Americans already secured. Maybe Biden talking vaccinations children something like Patients recover.

The article talks fatalities. Heres deal ""dafontz"" spend time locked house basement want. Come feel comfortable. rest us getting back normal. Interesting. Literally entire political spectrum, communists pirates far right.  recent breakthrough? listened Sam Harris podcast, interviewed scientist claimed vaccine prevent transmission, reduces severity symptoms. physician-scientist, even biases.

It matter examples find depending pathophysiological reason. formalin inactivated RSV vaccine kids died, previously exposed RSV. apparently older kids received vaccine fine previously exposed previous RSV infection immune system behaved better responding vaccine (overly simplified).

I'll opportunity eventually enroll kids eventual covid vaccine study, would like historical context. else think get direct science data? us weigh things enrolling first subjects. Kind useless comparison?

Today alone US 3x number total cases death Australia + NZ combined since start pandemic 330 million people entire USA, including kids, 4 million births year. we're 5 million extra doses, we're covered year, that's assuming every single person takes it, know anti-vaxxers won't.

Just going accounting replied to, already 65 million extra doses ordered beyond that.  fair. I’ve traveling extensively every month since covid started like 10 plus trips places including overseas trip Colombia month. Initially scared every trip I’m interacting like 10 20 people close quarters. every time get covid test trip, comes back negative. It’s hard feel scared point. mention don’t single personal friend acquaintance severe covid reactions. test positive non major effects minor things 1.Grocery store workers access surgical masks (theynare fully supply, cannbuy 100 like 10 dollars). 
2. Nurses literally direct contact people covid - cant socially distance.
3. dont think u get faulty n95 mask means. faulty n95 means doesnt stick around face accuracy meaning usually less effective cloth masks. 

Your making issue people, heroes reason barely coping wit virus, scared (rightfully so). bigger issues hand - like maybe fact masks fake, wearers upset masks fake Yes thats said. Ive watched interviews. wanted bipartisan agreement pass dont executive order. says coming end JULY (way earlier thought). initial 400m supposed end July? It’s one thing little vague president’s condition purposes continuity government. It’s another matter entirely blatantly lie dire things parading around motorcade, checking hospital prematurely, making grand spectacle white house says “I’m healed!” fact you’re actually woods.

I don’t get it. There’s shame getting sick. shouldn’t dent anyone’s “tough-guy” image. I’m critical anyone man, certainly didn’t revel coming COVID. try hide severity blatantly? makes wonder many people getting sick, “toughing out”, getting tested various reasons. Well Biden saying wants US better. already increased lot testing variants. limit vocabulary, think need term herd immunity necessarily mean complete immunity, instead refers saying: immunity severe disease.  Username checks Yet cases continue fall globally part. still bit early vaccines really make dent. I'm gonna say 'no'..... guess point nearly everyone vaccine won’t pandemic anymore tbh actually think Biden likes wearing mask lol course was, transferred medical facility rather simply treating White House. many places planet think *better* facilities &amp; resources treat POTUS White House? goodness sake, even limo used transport POTUS matched blood bank trunk. live feed. headline changes every hours. submission linking nypost.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

The virus already spreading uncontrollably US world really woken going on.

NZ great job, also lot luck. major outbreak early on, able control virus got stage zero covid longer plausible strategy.

They also open land borders like countries Europe, decentralised government rebellious population like US. really think 600 million doses going left ships, planes, trucks night June 30th clock strikes midnight, BLAM! 600 million available?

Get real.

Most us adults vaccinated, want be, July. deals infectious warehouses! Fly bad next year since nobody antibodies absurd want participate clinical trial unlicensed experimental vaccine? Listen yourself. seriously think would genuinely thought way couple years ago? licensed use US 1995. Chicken pox parties people dealt chicken pox kill contract adult. best contract young. think anyone time even considered would ever chicken pox vaccine coming near future. News spread quickly then. dont tell J&amp;J vaccine traditional (unless they've gotten ebola vaccine) haha sorry.

We lost several people close us last year. horrible painful, much could say goodbye. Gets sad thinking it. need someone vent please feel free DM me. &lt;3 I'm willing sit list amount reasons valid take vaccine. I'll first research further.

Just chill fear-mongering focus number cases, declining rapidly (despite listed variants) I’ve lost weight gained muscle endurance pandemic.  reason plan getting also already Covid, nobody seems take account looking travel restrictions (disturbing one asks nobody asking) vaccine passports lot less lot states considering Florida middle pack deaths like comes nowhere though case. past year we've watched pretty much every prominent republican Washington declare single voice virus big deal minimize response much possible, go loudly proudly personally disregard restrictions guidelines kind demented show strength courage. 

So one gets sick, suggest maybe little bit fault exactly outlandish claim. that's personal behavior level, that's say nothing whatever unquantifiable impact rhetoric regard perpetuating aggravating whole situation general along. already are, military/DoD budget pays vaccines given troops. Sounds like real crapshoot. fakes reasonably competent, yet others are, well, crap I'm skeptical I've trying get mom vaccinated weeks. 74. friends family state 75+ none able get vaccinated yet. mid February already. Competent leaders, competent government people enough trust last two things competent willing follow rules. federalist system works also hurt. clarify last sentence? lose context ""20 30 year old wouldn't"" I'm interested trying understand trying say. weird many comments upset safer  think? September?! Dang. Tell possible safely reopen schools. don’t enough vaccine doses also made errors one national strategy. thought so. hoping would change tune recovering, didn't. never fever COVID.  I've found way avoid pain life: Avoid making connections anything worthwhile. know family health worker kids trial, younger one 7 years old, remember one, I'll ask update. voice generation right Yup. going go wrong beginning pubs restaurants? New South Wales lot places checking signed $5000 fine don't. article mention kind study performed, guess minister pushing blame bad covid spike variant rather take responsibility. Start vaccinating everyone - April 

Will supply everyone - July don’t know clinical trial is. Clinical trials exist approve medications too. Yes, what's proven. COVID especially important mask infect 12 days showing symptoms. flu, that's 1 day most. Wearing masks cough enough. like would get COVID pandemic-like again. Yet thousands lives would spared. Also probably taking flu vaccine hurt Okay great! please get it?! Like PLEASE?!!! I've wondered especially need ~28 days 1st jab immunity week 2nd jab they're following original timing. Many schools US longer open September August. EUA September still kids school prior vaccination schools open regular dates. Maybe phase-in solution best? Admit got vaccine 1st, allowing yet got remain home studies. I'll take flu I'm curious see how/if Superbowl effects numbers upcoming weeks. right, giving children untested experimental drugs great idea. Good thing immunizations tested distributed.

What tested fact Covid affect health long term. basically saying prefer chance kid life-long disability vs taking vaccine prevent it, probably affect kid negative ways. think context relevant.

At point almost one vaccinated, anyone ignores masks public health measures endangers others spread disease innocent people put strain health care system since even needing hospital care non-Covid related serious diseases suffering.

After Covid vaccine becomes widely available, becomes stupid since vaccinated protected other's stupidity.

I realize issues herd immunity people can't vaccinated health reasons large, vaccinated protected seem - worst - get worst cases.

It somewhat like going great extent people careful following public health guidelines seem contracting Covid high percentages go around maskless. Compare Biden campaign versus ex-President's campaign terms numbers aides staffers contracted Covid one campaign careful careless matter POLICY FFS. 

Again over-simplifying since people contract COVID extreme conditions even masking can't help impossible social distance. Los Angeles, website lists places 3 Covid cases reported obvious certain workplaces inherently dangerous fault workers. SoS office good place start concerning felt fairly positive vaccine uptake idea get vulnerable sorted, good go nation. We'll J&amp;J soon AZ, doom gloom administration? :-( hadn’t heard love it! Thanks! agree you. Unfortunately, people stupid immunocompromised sick unable take vaccine. they're 18, allowed take vaccine yet. protect herd immunity, stupids. enabling doctors need licenses reviewed. Silver lining: don’t die COVID 
😄 exactly. thing happened maybe 93 94, honestly know vaccine then. Take grain salt haha saw Twitter. Wear masks year, save lives!

As former Californian feel bad you.

We vaccines, hospitalizations dropping like rocks over, deaths soon follow - need go back living lives now. 600 million july, ofcourse one batch lot vaccines that, also US really need 600 million. lets say 20% want get vaccinated(probably though) 30 million already got infected + people can't get vaccinated health issues + kids can't get vaccinated currently.  everyone consumes news. lot people get info word mouth. hear news trust friends more. Forever. media loved hate much. They're going let go. Pakistani immigrant doctor Texas, expect Texas? white dude would never happened. God fucking hate Texas. weren’t wife’s family I’d never step foot shit hole state. Dude straight sucking air like dying fish Mussolini photo op returned Walter Reed. surprising. Precisely. 

It’s controversial. It’s 1+1. Science. Fact. 

Feelings don’t matter. don’t get covid extras, it’s really problem. Send rest world ensure mutations outside country kept minimum. moral thing do, it’s act good controversial position world stage while. 330 million people live USA. believe Biden administration believes vaccinating children possible late 2021 many new 200 million doses added already contracted 400 million two companies. less effective easier administer doses vaccines sold given countries. Quick question, need 600 million 350 million people live US? That's vaccine tier system, assume took cause 1c yet. nationwide system anyway, states tweaking bit.

I'm talking business restriction tier system based cases positivity rate. purple/red/orange/yellow one. This. Boom.

I’m (very) afraid 1 year old dying COVID. I’m terrified long-term repercussions virus. don’t know survivors could deal decades, I’m willing take chances baby. Agreed said enough. Supply issue, approval like move. Accuse someone else impostor call impostor. Stop you. Americans every single one. Including kids. So, Summer kids able get vaccinated yet. Canadian here..... read? I’ve suggested anyone else keep child home fact stated several times best family may another. It’s individual situation needs evaluated. 

As claiming “keep alluding hoards contradictory information”, said once, seeing patients work. Sorry didn’t googling you? research exists isn’t definitive one way there’s good case made argument. 

You’re pretty passionate decision I’ve made kids zero possible effect you. suggest evaluate peoples chosen paths matter much you. good night. absolutely board benefits person learning challenges school. 

But change life time earnings due 6 weeks school? I'm skeptical results could reliably replicated. 6 weeks feels like short period drastic impact. Much thanks anti vaxxers tin foil asshats there. One thing wonder get J&amp;J one Moderna one later make body’s immune system explode?

I mean J&amp;J put those, it’s one dose, could throw lower risk younger people like me, mRNA ones could go high risk people now. 

Then eventually get mRNA one 

I don’t know Covid much infectious, stronger virus flu viruses believe. Someone else commented excess cleaning basically eliminated flu virus. top that, yearly flu cases arent nearly high covid cases obviously, less people vectors. No, Among Us imposter. Childhood vaxxination mandetory enforced globally military world vaxxine police. I'm joking. children vaxxinated, unless they're poor responder vaxxines. odds infant die less likely infant live. Vaxxination production one earths global endevaours next food distrubition water management. Plastic pollution shipping costs metric kiloton vaxxines damned yen pound value could worth. Track shit block-chain lets get GATTACA moving say. 

But examples kids perma fucked long term fucked all? Lmao, picture head George W Bush air craft carrier mission accomplished sign background asking I’m going pandemic over. Good bot point I'm going believe Crichton trolling us grave. mean learning people tested antibodies any, hardly news worthy it. True! I’m grateful pulled pretty well! doubt. Stopping hospitalizations deaths important factor. 

Once numbers crater, focus developing therapeutics treating hopefully cases lead hospitalization. Hollywood variant mean, know long term side effects (if any). long they're providing accurate summation fine. easy also say ""...BUT 50m people gotten shot clear long term effects even started emerge""

If doctor straight anti-vax ought lose medical license. long wasn’t blackface doses already option order, ordering. news here. really see open borders vaccinated tourists New Zealand vaccinates 70% population (I believe would around 3.5 million take long!). BioNTech building new factory Germany! shouldn’t shortage long.

I think US start shipping doses overseas pandemic clearly dwindling here. Lmao thoughts exactly... Obviously people die horrible, like literally care flu way, AstraZeneca vaccine shown protect severe infection death South African strain. study was, mention, skewed toward young participants, gathered data severe illness.

AstraZeneca Oxford told press *expect* protective, saying based results Johnson + Johnson vaccine’s trials SA, materially different design using different spike protein code.

Do citation actual study shows AZ vaccine protective SA variant? Phase 1C already gone COVID19.ca.gov Makes alot sense now. also presume young people got excited fast vaccinations taking less precautions would expect. Gosh, whatever doomsday guys pandemic over? They’re currently fine (I sick, course), talking virus we’ve never seen thus don’t know ramifications it. like one time didn’t know chicken pox could lead shingles road.

I know “likely” experience problems future. don’t know you’re parent, aren’t, let say this: parents don’t want fuck children. decisions today fuck road, man, that’s lot guilt. I’d rather deal situation first place don’t need worry it, alas am.

So yeah, get vaccinated avoid it, that’s way go. far know, generally bit reduced everyone, giving symptoms etc get it.

Which imo better symptoms many full covid rest. people behavior proves so! vaccines delivered. Administering whole different ballgame, last fall doubt. wonder try sensationalize next keep fear levels turned up. 

How dare media report scientificially founded doubt existing vaccines might fully effective new virus strains global pandemic?

Those fearmongers! Okay, r/notliketheothergirls. tell guaranteed get covid, I'm saying stance ""well happen worth concerned always ignorant naive. 

We hospitals hit capacity come edge healthcare service collapse areas. Blowing like scary sounding statistics downplaying severity happening huge degree. 

When damn near every medical expert concerned, there's usually reasons regular people understand, make invalid. named way Clark Kent, since Covid Superman me.

(no, really, Kent South-East England). Except even J&amp;J one ineffective. It’s less 100% effective preventing death, even dreaded variants, importantly VACCINES REDUCE TRANSMISSION

They broadcast rooftops promise normalcy people get vaccinated Apparently company even enough funding purchase proper SSL certificate, that's indication whether medical research worth time reading about. I'm dubious. Thank President Biden! 👏🇺🇸 Probably means everyone eligible April course mean get vaccinated April factor supply also many vaccinations actually done April physically feel like argument misnomer. argument would hold saying kids less likely die rather pass around, true. Kids fairly low fatality rate this. doesn’t mean can’t pass around though. I’ve around nieces picked cold times count. Kids, cute be, little germ vectors. promise deliver?  let's suppose eligible americans (260M?) get vaccine, that's 520 million doses, already contracts 600 million end july Pfizer Moderna. would happen remaining unused 80 million doses + J&amp;J / Novavax / AstraZeneca vaccines? sell/give countries? 66% eFfEcTiVe

Your body 0% effective naturally. I’ll take chances waiting months holding Moderna/Pfizer giving chance get timeframe. 

Get whatever available worry booster shots future. unless they’re front line healthcare workers, receive vaccine according age like everybody else Later, troll! guess he's referring nearly well thr first wave. mean Germany example death wise we're averaging peak second wave 837 deaths per day compared peak back April averaging 228 deaths day. mean Germany added like 50k deaths since begining November. Yet March-November added 11k deaths.

And similar story Austria. second wave brutal whilst furst wave we're arguably model country barely hit compared neighbours. Things improved significantly doubt would thought they'd able deal second wave better. would assume first place? sounded real sure Board members don’t work inside hospital Honestly point vaccination way. It’s stupid rush everyone back classroom mere weeks/months hit vaccinated herd immunity. It’s better stay current course eliminate distance learning next school year.

Also school districts choice given 30% parents opt send kids in, you’re fooling one thinking fringe beliefs. parents agree keep em home. undercount vaccinations? Thank you! try protect ourselves.

You stay safe well! also possible refused vaccine, younger people higher rates older people.

Is true broadly across many countries? true Israel? references?  Vaccines always tested adults first since way immune systems fully developed. nothing Trump long medical science tradition. I'll wait independent analysis Brazil began immunizations vaccines made China’s Sinovac Biotech Britain’s AstraZeneca three weeks ago. Pazuello explain effectiveness Manaus variant analyzed.

That's good news either. study bogus, used test much high false positive rate. redo test samples **2018**: quite likely find equivalent number positives! Less effective.

In case AstraZeneca... effective.

In case Pfizer/Moderna... still effective (very early data), effective OG Covid. Ehhh think variant get USA proved Korean national infectious disease research center Celltrions\`s covid 19treatment highly effective UK variant. think never acceptable someone medical field use credentials pass around even vaguely anti vaccine rhetoric.

For people want vaccine choose get one, well that's choice disagree, can't anything except try advocate vaccination.

However, totally disgusting nurses doctors tell friends family members bullshit like ""we know long term effects vaccines"" ""oh we're young healthy need protected covid"".

That's actively harmful pisses see it. Worse death huh Long that! think someone *didnt* change opinion based new forthcoming data would idiot vaccines 100% affective, endanger others refusing get Yes, sooner better need another round boosters E484K. Although hopefully 1 dose, shall quicker. Yes suddenly mental health priority certain party! I'm glad they've come around I'm sure continue care mental health much pandemic! Pfizer said today, ""full pediatric vaccine available late 2021."" age bracket ""0-15 years age"" used.


Also never said testing completed younger age groups. Perhaps that's ""phase 3"" publically communicated today. Yeah right! 😂 Vaccinations really put perspective difference population US vs countries like India China. would know that? stupid kills that's problem. are, all, one who've saying start living normally choice make, government. think theory closer correct incorrect probably. That’s I’ve hated this. Don’t get wrong hate governor completely hate mostly way he’s handled this, wasn’t basically tied NY 2nd populous state, one would hating state much. right middle national average per capita almost entire time. 

Very states greater 60-70% compliance agreement whatever state guidelines look entire state. Sadly, doesn’t matter good regulations are. enough population every state disregarding effective. Source? saying make true isn’t Police state government doesn’t contact them. need go online fill form wait hold hours phone appointment. Many old computer illiterate people friends family make appointment them. Well makes variants look like losers. 300% transmissible. Shut fuck up. Good. wife got second Pfizer shots last week. Hawaii August, come! body choice. got last year too. 24M. Coming 5 months in, fatigue worst part, feeling similar you’ve finished strenuous run, except whole body basically lay bed day. get brain fog / confusion, chest pain, difficulty breathing / chest tightness, chills, muscle joint pain, nausea, headaches. symptoms come go exacerbated activity, even activity like walking stairs. days feel pretty normal now, never lasts terribly long. initially lost smell taste, probably recovered 25% smell, 80% taste. chest get tender too, shirt blanket feel heavy painful. feel like heart beats weirdly sometimes too, way measuring heart O2 levels. lungs appear fine X-ray, that’s good least. I’ve taking Alvesco, steroid inhaler, help breathing, well Vitamin D, Zinc, multivitamin. think Alvesco really helps. brain fog make really difficult read focus basically lay wait out. Even sitting extended period time quite taxing.

I hope child doesn’t suffer much recovers soon. I’m sorry you’ve deal :( know, I’m saying goal Vaccines needed want open country again. never shut residents still returning home world covid. Last covid cases leaked hotel quarantine, that's weakest point currently. Please, no.  word ""all"" problem. Lets settle ""most"", ""at least 80%"". 

I want wait fifty years last holdout emerge cave get vaccinated. still understanding.🙄 Yeah, think COVID highly unlikely kill children *immediately*, high risk long-term complications could easily shave decade two life day, without even considering quality-of-life problems long-term symptoms.

Exactly. thought six hours ago obviously bullshit. know Pfizer didn’t accept money Operation Warp speed right? 

I give trump administration credit mismanaging pandemic costing 400k lives though. I’ll also give credit securing good amount vaccines chance to, Pfizer literally came first.

Give credit credit due. tell reassuring sane competent person charge this. Thank god Joe Biden, thank everyone else voted him! Humanized monoclonal antibodies get suffix “-zumab” drugs, *all* sound like something Indiana Jones. thing scarier names prices. Well kept news know 100% statistic longer true - look data israel. 

As also said, new variants fully researched. 

Also, doctors seen deaths frequency ever - even they're still human beings. complete lack respect saying ""they handle it"" disgusting truly is, shouldnt speak upon matters lol.  could part answer ---  

By end June, great majority people Florida EITHER:

1. infection; OR
2. vaccination.

If 40% people infection, 40% vaccine, 80% people (minus overlap) effective immunity. Hate say it, *had* happen point. Lockdowns become much easy setup maintain. seems politicians consider sustainable now.

 Instead, measures possible short durations. extreme, flanked extreme effort identify infected people quarantine implement effective protection especially endangered people critical infrastructure. 

Unfortunately, see anything fourth month ever-lasting lockdown... think response governments thus far speak volumes danger. Oh agree.

Since I've home primarily go couple times week hour two time, reuse them. Walking grocery store 30 minutes hardware store, think warrants disposing mask right away. hang rear view mirror car let sun attack it. :)

When working 8-9 hours day it, I'd definitely dispose end day though. research that's done vaccines past hundred years much work done mRNA (ie took days develop vaccine) what's worst thought could happen?

One reason vaccines approved SARS MERS coronaviruses researchers struggling create vaccines create potentially deadly inflammatory response similar one generated live viruses themselves, one... that. clear, obviously solvable problem, needed research devoted it, safe COVID vaccines now, required experimenting different doses running actual human trials make sure safe.

Also, know think mRNA vaccines super established technology this. literally first approved vaccines using mRNA tech. reason even know work bothered testing instead haphazardly injecting people random doses inevitable mutations? Let run wild test 11 months again?

No, much like flu vaccines, able shorter trials faster approvals baseline understanding safety effectiveness. fact, finished research needed SARS MERS vaccines 2000's early 2010's, may well shorter turnaround COVID vaccines too. deny younger people get sick (or even die). think hypothetical world everyone reacted Covid way average 20 30 year old worth shutting society for. 209 million people US 18...and want vaccine. enough 300 million end July without trials children completed enough vaccines everyone.

Czechia weird though two massive peaks cases rising again. UK vaccinated 20% population, US 13%.

It depends count it. US 3.6% population fully vaccinated, UK 0.8% fully vaccinated. idea weren’t planning vaccinating kids. Kids part What's ""reasonable"" prevalence? 

To get 90% R value would need high. Normality includes 100,000 people country infected every day.

Even trust authority figures, 44.8 million doses covid 19 vaccine distributed, also means significant number non authority figures received it, yet public safety threat noted. Anyone swayed overwhelming amount evidence vaccine safe effective swayed simply repeating evidence. Something tells April... immunosuppressants tocilizumab sarilumab, found reduce stays intensive care least seven days average, according data released UK government-backed Remap-cap study, conducted researchers Imperial College London Utrecht university Netherlands. Hallelujah! cooped home year now. Right? 20-30 year olds like ""THESE PRIME YEARS LIFE"" give flying fuck something kills *checks notes* less 0.1% infected population. mean shit, already care part.  Goalposts shifting, shifting, shifting. hear - hear masks year - what? end? Jesus Christ - vaccinate elderly at-risk go back normal, option. 200 million additional doses, added 400 million already ordered, get 600 million total.  Many diseases routinely vaccinate pose small risk healthy young people. vaccines risk smaller still. case significantly decreases chance spend several days weeks feeling ill even would overwhelming likely recover uneventfully afterwards. lol amreeka  One reasons said populous state Wait second. telling could survive pandemic without mass graves competent leadership usa? vaccine poses much smaller risk, aka zero risk, prevents spreading illness immunocompromised people can’t take vaccine. UK Variant doubling every ten days, going get worse gets better. make matters confusing, Kent also town Ohio. Ohio also seen variant emerge similarities b.1.1.7 That's evidence support cretinous, craven claim?

Pfffft one might actually microchips generally agree unless learn covid long term damage people It’s always worthwhile pay attention. Last Jan/Feb people saying thing overhyped virus wouldn’t spread “non shithole” countries.

We’re going see variants, knows maybe 1918 style resurgence impacting different demographic. maybe nothing. Nobody really knows.

But wouldn’t write things don’t like them. That’s definition ignorant. know, blame something lol Canadians always message boards shitting Americans jerking socialized medicine  thought said kids get spreading it...sounds like talking sides mouth me. Wonder chapter Cuomo’s book covered under.  reword question ask confirmed potential carrier. that's think % vaccinated used metric reopening. There's dead bodies everywhere Florida! shit show! It'll even worse 2 weeks bet.

/s stupid wanting take experimental vaccine isn’t FDA approved yet EUA? Taking vaccine right means participating clinical trial. I’m stupid don’t want participate clinical trial, wrong you? Yes did. know did. mean, clearly, right? I’m sure you’re trying parent shame someone trying best thing family. thats happening adults never vaccinated restrictions lifted. say. Sounds weird “Marburg doses” even though it’s technically correct bookkeeping. Poorly structured reporting systems.

California California.

They massive vaccine shortages moment. shut several sites, hospitals basically told people stop requesting them.

We informed today anyone 65 put ""lottery"" get get ask.

This includes sick immunocompromised people. basically disease thats keeping locked house less guarantees covid likely fuck dead ... going placed behind millions healthy people walking around wearing masks. need fix distribution, customer base. get tons essential workers sick people able get vaccine right healthy people they're taking parents grandparents. willing take before, that's bad. elderly willing go before, why's that?

There's reason Mass can't giving vaccine people need every state able it. think anyone really knows greater 0% chance. Yeah, earlier trials shown AZ weaker AB response pfizer strong T-cell response compared pfizer.

How deduced may Also point case anyone's confused say 'next time around' statement above, mean fine second covid infection protection first; vaccine counts first exposure previously naive people.

Thanks clarification vaccinated person able spread covid others embarrassing? india third world country honestly gesture generosity shows slowly getting better place, appreciative dawg answer one actually knows. (Ducks) 

I think likely case cases drop substantially - thinking 1-3% infection rates places, waves certain areas certainly spark anxiety concern - nothing like last year. could see areas hitting like 11-12% maybe adding form restrictions back, hospitalizations deaths remain low vaccines added. 

Venues slowly add people. Outdoors, like baseball games, may hit 50% greater. Golf events higher attendance. 

Indoor dining back lot locations. Mass transportation continue masks. private businesses keep masks. I’m imagining place like Disney, instance, may ask people wear masks indoors hotels, allow take certain areas parks, etc. 

Again... one knows sure. lot wishful thinking sprinkled realism. related immunity vaccines Brazil would lose efficacy. AstraZeneca essentially ineffective strain similar mutations, also noted escape natural immunity. 

None official's claims make sense. There’s lot shame getting COVID. Trump it, fault taking anything seriously. rallies wearing mask. People wished would die. That’s trend conservative COVID. yeah, I’d say good deal shame. widespread? Yeah, I'm gonna call BS one. That's ok, patient :) going make claim, really need able back up. fact despite source variant UK SA’s cases decreased even faster rate us shows blown proportion actually wonders mental health skip headlines articles. also takes away incentive keep fear mongering up. reward behavior click article. know fucking corrupt Indian government is?

It also begs question: get ride changing lives drastically name safety? Ban driving? Ban drinking smoking? Ban playgrounds, skydiving, mountain climbing, surfing, etc? Ban leaving home ""non essential"" reasons moving forward? seems slippery slope bring covid restrictions us government mandated level. mean this? 600M doses 300M people end July.

Everyone else announces secured enough everyone vaccinated.

600,000 million doses.  wonder going use prefusion stabilized spike protein time instead wild type. JJ/pfizer/moderns/Novovax use prefusion stabilized form. Organ damage ""pop up"" though. may get medically diagnosed years, damage would along, along symptoms.

I also mentioned possibility chronic organ damage pretty explicitly. caused direct action virus though certainly one things need worry about.

That damage either happens though doesn't. Similarly autoimmune conditions either happen don't. virus magical hide body like herpesviruses do.

So yes, worried incidence ""long COVID"" possibility long term organ damage. know incidence is, people concerned. thought covered that.

The comment responding though worried virus ""reactivating"" point future, buts powered cybernetic terminator waiting activation codes. work like that. gone gone. either caused damage, triggered autoimmune conditions, didn't.  Ironic one biggest criticisms Trudeau prioritize Canadian citizens. Go American super-spreaders! Gotta spread all! would literally take 16 years vaccinate everyone 7 million month paste. called biontech vaccine. see there. Lolol proven Pfizer, Moderna, Astrazeneca. I'm sure J&amp;J. quite. give us 300M people Pfizer/Moderna. 

With less 16, we'd need more. course, assumes 100% vaccination rate, doubt ever hit. false, propaganda bots never said don’t want get vaccinated it’s available me, wouldn’t want government force people get think people bodily autonomy. even worst form dooming I’ve seen sub Yes. terrible article. could biased tried..., obviously did. It'll ever-decreasing restrictions states.

Certain states like Florida Iowa South Dakota eliminate remaining restrictions early.

California, New York, Maryland similar states tiering restrictions keeping long can. isn't

No one wants lock forever

This propaganda That’s like hear responses like among fringe conspiracy theorists said I’m talking about. They’re tiny minority don’t need herd immunity. 

I’m talking “they developed fast” “they skipped animal trials” “I’m gonna wait see long term effects” crowd current suburban existence already. happened two years ago. summary conclusions expect people formulate megacomment:

Yeah, vaccines reduce infections, symptoms upon infection, even variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people milder symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well.

If young people get exposed develop immunity via clearing infection, variant exposed broaden immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). they'll good broad immunity variety variants, seems likely indication catch spread virus. thing happens someone vaccinated exposed new variant. immunity broadened strengthened subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. remember, many people less likely spread virus, pretty unlikely reduced level spread sufficient sustain virus way seen past year. variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing mind changed new information though, take gospel. Exactly saying unless feed vaccines 100% safe matter hive mind get shit on. live Tucson, AZ. One Saturday night last June, got 95°F outside (approaching 8pm so), apartment’s A/C unit’s capacitor domed running errands (I didn’t know time). temperature started rising, got back, thermostat reading 88°F!!

So, called landlord, told problem, said, “Okay, I’m going get touch maintenance, let call back.”

3 minutes later…

“Yes, hi, Jared {one maintenance guys} next-half hour.”

…and half-hour later, Jared roof, taking look A/C unit, took 30 seconds figure wrong (RE: A/C unit capacitor domed). able fix immediately, cool air started blowing apartment again.

Impeccable service. came ASAP address issue, fixed time. didn’t pay dime. Well, actually ended giving guy $10-bill (that cash had) loaf banana bread troubles (it 8pm Saturday night!), even said, “Honestly, I’m getting paid double since it’s past 5pm, appreciate it!” enjoy rest Saturday night.

The absolute biggest benefit renting: something breaks, call, gets fixed ASAP, charge. don’t suffer trying go sleep night, go online following morning search someone come fix it, end paying hundreds dollars. go high 100% can't much worse :) True, they're 100% effective keeping hospital alive (according Phase 3 trials).

If 5% chance getting sniffles, that's ok me. sentence makes sense. replying question, vaccination mandatory NZ. It’s right. media confused clearest minds. I'm expert 1.6 seems consistent previous estimates. Earth EU order 75 million. wrong people?

The USA allowing exports, Earth EU allow enough citizens? signed 2 month year old Moderna trial. Although, know picked yet. got second dose today, good hear. I’m sorry report misinformation. Many countries without manufacturing capabilities rolled vaccinations well. Hope understand. thing sticks quote necessarily rise cases rather baseline already 29%. It’s true many animals carrying virus. Based see, think moderate people stopped browsing comments. people remain comments tend say things upvote things anti-mask, anti-lockdown, always anti-media. They’re concerned media colluding force us wear masks rest lives. don’t get it. Common sense sort dead comment sections.

I think normal people know vaccines coming likely around summer, tuned out. Great news!! I'm getting Pfizer dose 2 tomorrow morning. I'm curious anyone else who's 2 doses mind sharing felt? I've heard decent amount people saying felt super shitty like day sister said bad all. I'm going expecting worst I'm hoping best. Australia can’t seem shake thing. don’t, never, ability vaccinate entire planet time. unrealistic pipe dream, sounds great Reddit way workable real world.  course we'll take done something nwrong highest living standards world need ask nation majority people running water help. Perfect Peggy wants yearly misery, gonna happen since people snap. Israel also gave lot vaccination data Pfizer part deal. 1/4. I’ve gotten first round Moderna. I’ve developed swollen lymph node around clavicle side body received shot. Anyone else side effect? long last you? It’ll week post-shot tomorrow it’s
still fairly swollen (has gone little). misusing term - herd immunity mean virus gone. suggest reading least opening paragraph state's one new case community since April, Australia battled outbreak nation wide, always regions within Australia. Sadly, Melbourne drawn short straw twice since April.

But 5 days still quite preferable Europe going through. Translation: 
By end April, anyone wants vaccine, able go website run county local government staff 5 people started working website April 2020, instead waited February 2021 start designing it, register get waiting list. idea waiting list long take actually get vaccine. lucky might get automated phone call letting know registered. viscosity paste probably makes harder inject I'm Canadian approve message. Every place know NJ requires this. standard practice? doesn't. 100M J&amp;J order. 300M Oxford ordered.

We initially 200M Moderna 100M Pfizer. got 100M Pfizer. we're getting 100M each. That's 300M Moderna 300M Pfizer. agree. Vaccinate vulnerable open back up. wife nurse Winnipeg one old friends school days also nurse moved back home Minnesota help hometown COVID. show appreciation, locals vandalized car Minnesota license plate. car pooled work wife could get license plate changed over.

It cars American plates vandalized Canada, happened cars plates provinces too. reason not. People get flu shots every year, never ask last shot was, even though half dozen different shots choose (which may known rarely offered choice). 

Each shot covers 3-4 strains flu. confuse strains covered manufacture shot. reasons. asked wants part something contributes society. Second, perfect health. mother fit underlying health issues make us vulnerable. We’ve assumed passed genetics him. Third, trust science behind vaccines he. Every vaccine provides decent protection, even JNJ vaccine gives immunity. vaccine available still good shape. reliable antibody tests, especially post-vaccination?

Just shot dark... talking cousin pretty bad pulmonary embolism back around Christmas weird I've got risk factors absolutely recollection blood clot prior lung issues (since then, I've also gone see hematologist tested possible clotting disorder still nothing).

My cousin theorized could asymptomatic super mild case COVID prior pulmonary embolism could triggered something, I'm wondering get antibody test satisfy curiosity even bother. think would depended connections government. Christie survived, Guiliani survived. hear rich people don't. I'm guessing government connections, particularly Trump got regeneron monoclonal antibodies approved yet. Much better, that’s sure. It’s palomino! Effective what, lower transmission 96% safety (last estimate heard) they're detrimental virus anyone 70yo, I'm viroligist far tell information available can't see reason take raise pharma profits able travel future forget us stuck areas SA variant spreading. everyone else breathing sigh relief eagerly awaiting vaccine, we're still much screwed areas feels like government give shit we're supposed vaccines offer like 10% protection SA variant Especially considering Spanish Flu may started Kansas. you. Though may healthy people may health issues. Yep. also honestly one gonna convince person anything come around themselves. One less person ahead rest us waiting.  One reason vaccines approved SARS MERS coronaviruses researchers struggling create vaccines create potentially deadly inflammatory response similar one generated live viruses 

From read never serious concern coronavirus vaccines. dengue yes definitely happened dengue totally different virus even natural reinfection dengue causes cytokine storms.

Yes technically anything possible reason believe vaccine enhanced disease risk with, eg, flu?

Given one side trolley problem we're going risk would need pretty high. lol, first need available EU.  factor. factor, counts.

That said leadership like US's leadership would probably also raging tire fire, island people friends neighbors, ability add sane voice in. communities apprehensions widespread, takes community engagement, hope people already working on. question go EUA licensed, implying it’s currently licensed, stated.  Fuckkk. I've hopeful vaccine months away family, SA variant main one area guess we're screwed.  r/unexpectedmiketyson think big thing people/companies take sick leave seriously.

Flu mainly spread symptomatic vs coronavirus. Lots unnecessary spread prevented.

At least short term, people sneezing, coughing fever people less criticized potentially sent home.

I also think flu vaccine compliance go up. think even people pay money might take serious. get coronavirus vaccine, flu vaccine much studied. Maybe spread campaign schools older populations.

Both big impact. mask social distancing. think least next year two things slightly changed 2 aspects. Phase 3 Moderna trial still technically “ongoing” sense original 30000 participants agreed followed up. getting EUA vaccine mean you’re part clinical trial. one going convince take this, curious, hospital serious case covid would decline monoclonal antibody drugs? also still technically EUA. Fuck that. going missing another half year lofe Big true Steal developing nations still can’t manage get vaccines. mess. can’t speak vic government guess yes likely. First vaccine apparently front line workers, hotel quarantine staff chances leaks, hence snap lockdowns, would hopefully minimised. Cute think disproves said  general work fine long countries keep booster shots needed. mean exactly it. that’s people want hear. discharged 9 days(even though thought going make day 3), suffered another three weeks home could walk stairs mind mostly clear,my wife deserves medal looking me. dunno, podcast said might happen next couple weeks. LOLOLOL. Come back they’ve actually delivered administered. think good idea going difficult really implement vaccination available general public no. proof. shit posting. isn’t possible vaccines give herd immunity. 

Covid forever. 

So, what’s plan exactly guys? seems like may honestly locked entirety life. Like. Seriously. else change strategy. 

And so, now?  Right course. That's sensible way get there. point take get there. AU's plan use circuit breakers then? Nice try Jan. even remotely true. Look list countries ranked covid vaccination rates, find lot countries don’t manufacture vaccines locally. It’ll happens, happens. be, to, said, nothing changes, now, wear mask best.

That solution say april anyone wants article right, admitted bad wluld admitting wrong. set election lie, disease let accept lost. narcissism cost many lives. going wear masks despite mass vaccination effective vaccine order save lives, what's say ever stop wearing them? think it’s realistic. I’m 18 year old healthy college student appointment later next month ramped vaccinations college couple days ago. defense, university vaccinating students getting priority living dorm. know college students who’ve vaccinated already though multitude reasons. Fingers crossed I’ll first dose Easter (my birthday). familiar cases... Israel paid huge amount money Pfizer, UAE using mostly Chinese vaccines think Pfizer recall correctly, Chile done pretty good job, Serbia using mix vaccines wise move part. great job biden idk either kindergarten 1st grade si either 97 98 Osterholm saying thinks may change moderna Pfizer 1 dose soon well. finding time goes people may reach full immunity 3 weeks initial dose, since shorter amount time trials, didn’t initially test see 1 dose enough. I’m probably explaining poorly. 2/4 podcast episode Osterholm Update. No, we're going use vaccines give herd immunity.

If world anything go off, using virus deliver herd immunity instead creates infectious strains. Google ""Manaus"" virus induced herd immunity looks like practice. forget August Trudeau prorogued Parliament hide blatant corruption Scandal.  Rather fucking around parliament summer running like crook, focusing getting Canada vaccines. Instead busy hiding criminality covering ass, thus failing look Canadians pandemic. reason really difficult people power give power. nuts staying facts lmfao. disagree them? anything said false? Australia doesn’t need rely vaccines. able contain outbreak too. too! Aaaaand there’s “but they’re island” drivel. vaccine go authorized emergency use licensed (approved)? Bullshit “Almost one vaccinated”

False narratives abound!
Over 1/10 Americans vaccinated   Well yes since USA allow exports. true pretty much every country vaccine manufacturer based country

Except not. Israel, UAE, Seychelles, Bahrain, Serbia, Malta, Monaco, Iceland, Maldieves, Chile, Slovakia, Singapore Turkey - among others - [all higher vaccination rates vast majority countries specific Covid vaccine manufacturer country (I skipped bunch EU countries ahead Canada without manufacturing facilities well). competent leaders able work effectively private sector &amp; countries take care citizens - leadership Canada clearly lacks. totally understand feel parent, feel way. feel heavy responsibility everything possible keep safe. may able prevent getting want know tried damn best. sounds like hope long term effects kids. great job I’m glad recovered. Define strong? owns guardian?  brings us back to: intend get information way different we've already done? listen statistics available news, listen statistics available online, they'll listen close friends neighbors, method could possibly use educate people? example ecoli really strange. think impact/death/illness would bigger without recalls? 

This seems like example low effort action (recalling meat) significant impact (potentially saving lives). really see big response, death suffering would much larger without recalls. Meanwhile Europe nothing. I'm sure people said thing smallpox polio, too.  court ( mean countries rule law, China) juror would replaced.

The trial would poisoned.

I'm pointing out. like rest world,I know blame lies. lies CCP. agree characterization.

He thinks *should* switch giving many first doses possible, fast possible. people make decisions (who him, though influence) far opposed plan. What's even point doses lying around? ""Available Texas""...and yet heard anything eta available either. 
 
Right February still crickets college students retail staff (aka both) get vaccine. 
 
I want stop wear hot N95's pinch ears 10 hour shifts switch nice feltlike covers... 
 
(mods, comment *should* happily meet requirements :smirk:) Laaaaawdy lawdy, sweet Jesus, save children!!!

You're joke. time, Canada made bet. chose significantly invest domestic capacity make vaccine, made bet countries would willingly export vaccines. turned bad bet.

This kind wrong. *might* able argue Canada made bet, so, made years ago. invest bunch domestic capacity pandemic began, cannot make vaccine. tried get Phizer/Moderna make here, uninterested (and variety reasons, hard blame them).

We're relying countries produce option; decision made years pandemic ever began.

In fact, *are* investing domestic capacity, pay late year earliest stuff takes lot time. Spot on. 

You’ll get upvoted propagating fear here, downvoted suggesting viable solutions god forbid display pessimism skepticism light stuff like “wear two masks”. 

Time wake people. endemic. unfortunate loss life early pandemic unacceptable, it’s time something it, read pandemics / epidemics work. Wear mask, wear two five. Live let live. lost someone covid19, direct blame profited massively this. 85-90% wealth assets Nation hands small: 200,000 people. wasn’t coordinated attack entity, sloppy chaotic middle-school lunch room fight politicians public health officials. People died privatized healthcare system made fortune it. Mismanagement underprepared around. 

When titanic struck iceberg sunk it, took nearly two hours sink. didnt realize sinking 50
mins afterwards. minute 42 now....My biggest fear longer covid19, economy left aftermath. number people starve death continue dragging status quo. safe, Although agree Canadian smugness pandemic revolting, still hope send vaccines soon possible get population vaccinated virus hopefully control. mensch thing do, lots really good people hope get vaccinated ASAP. Amen. Seeing kind lockdown distancing speculation flu cases worrisome. people die flu don’t believe we’ve come close filling hospitals recent years. 

I’ll wear mask it’s asked absolutely nothing else. want bribe people dehumanize themselves. F Thank God. That's say. feel like Cersei sipping red wine, whilst watching Canada burn beg vaccines. 

🍷 😆 💉 🛑 👍🏾 Ok, thought then. surprised moment. keeping track order forecasts campaign deliveries missed week.

It's really useful compare US 33% June think things looking pretty good. I'm looking forward see local health authorities scale sudden big increase antigen, there'll probably mistakes made there.

And I'm personally looking forward roll delicious Pfizer (or whatever) juices.  number 5 sun? need nuke sun. worry, they'll find danger! Good news never stops scare media.  agree Trump supported mask wearing encouraged population take seriously US would good shape. guys capacity deal spikes. 

Fully socialized healthcare like Canada leaves room surge capacity ways deal emergency scale. truly believe middle ground found somewhere socialized private.  LOL. think that? Remember article south african variant infect already infected? Vaccinations important us, ever truly get situation untill people vaccinated. 

Plus scientists know cases dropping, there's telling whether would rise again. Sure thing. it’s typical EU allows exports vaccines enough. states USA first approach. never seen criticism within USA. make valid points. honesty hated including physicians said. really speaking lack uptake front line health workers. spend quite bit time working phd chemists biologist. correct. area expertise narrow. nearly overall physiological expertise needed clinical medicine. 

Sorry offended you. vague statement contrast opinion, contrast said hallways.  overly complicated tier system anymore hasn’t weeks. Right it’s health care workers people 65+.

California started relatively slow vaccinations, caught supply constrained. system bit confusing, depending county, least mine isn’t bad. Maybe  It’s disappointing. thought could handle things. really can’t. guess number people overwhelming first thought blog post quite good explaining things. explain governments nothing give relevant companies money start building equipment ahead time case vaccines get approved. money required nothing compared lives lost money list lockdown. could be, I'm still really comfortable taking risk. disagree risks near zero. still know long-term effects COVID, even babies kids. restrictions years old it’s everyone? Wtf better plan.

Customer facing workers...something. Can’t open season. Canadian American well. best friend still Canada. comparing pregnancy care miscarriage care . offered way tests ultrasounds was. Granted co pay couldn’t get even wanted private. knew girl could find ob open use family doctor Mid wife Canada time . don’t mind except general practitioner couldn’t even diagnosis missed mc misdiagnosed completely left hanging 2 weeks carrying dead baby. pregnancy went straight ogybn getting weekly scan monitor towards 30 weeks. best friend amazed.

LOL. basically EU made fuss nothing.  much money comparison money list economy lockdown like Germany? What’s billion extra? people make decisions beholden governments Brazil, South Africa, UK. They’re going test vaccines people can’t even consent it? Q2, crime.

Of course Q2.

Marburg output Q2 = 250 Million doses.

EU Q2 = 75 Million BT doses. 9? Brazil president pm. yeah right that. health minster, idea anything him. Late party doesn’t matter TBH. 

If high platelets low platelets end result body decides destroy them. difference go zero faster.  really, plant abs others like important anything else. Throw enough money people something done time. started late. Thanks. provides 50% reduction chance getting all, chance getting severely? 2 high risk elderly parents I'm really concerned them. Right they're offering Pfizer places, that's case? I've heard people rejected get certain vaccine still able get vaccine month later. vaccine centers canceled half operating days half many vaccines thought. data supports guys anecdotes. said didn't. wrong. Oxford vaccine life support point Seems simply trying hide unprepared state respond emergency. Especially considering 9/11 huge sums money supposedly invested preparing major biological/chemical attack. money spent properly resources available easily shifted responding pandemic. Instead find even plan deal 9000 people need extended care. Idk remember reading vaccine vaccinate vaccines. Omg! Yes, hard. completely relate you, especially year finally taught set boundaries. still struggle. keep worrying in-laws hate me. can't control mad boundary set. means lot people eager get vaccinated. Even right, which, not, fact experts change opinion based data GOOD thing. 

God damn still explain people? anti-science society bone. Hope future better. started development vaccine March. That’s started build facility. want know reason delay was. anything permitting like local building permits, someone needs held responsible loose job. wait someone brings old ""vaccine nationalism/what poor Africa?!"" strawman argument.... mRNA vaccine mainly exported rich countries. likely scenario. Scientists physicians cautious example, previous vaccination data annual influenza shots would suggest abnormalities occurring.   Preferably access room via outdoors. struggle keep workers getting infected corridors, there's ever risk jumping rooms jeopardising whole system.

Think whole thing form bailout hotel industry, would rather gave money something actually worked, personally. sure assessment nothing political leanings, right? Reddit ridiculously partisan point laugh. mean? haven’t seen people take months recover? don’t consider long term new evidence cannot provided yet. effects COVID may super harmful actual long term get vaccinated avoid potential occur. isn’t complicated seem purposefully acting fool. trollin me, bro? Yeah, pretty high immunity first wave variant escapes natural immunity extent would quickly take over. Looking graphs Amazonas wave doesn’t look spiked much faster first one.  China getting nothing. fault it’s like sending us vaccines. Supposedly everything control, need vaccines? Even Boris Johnson learnt something stint ICU! No, it’s nature vaccine. introduces body directly spike protein virus. virus hasn’t mutated enough change protein. [My answer comment data prove vaccine protect volunteers. I'm asking is: even antibodies fail protect, vaccinated person still defense effect virus keeps protected? 

That sample size small young people (for size) determine whether vaccine could could prevent infected people going hospital. even infection rate, clear. would need data understand point it’s important “vigilant”, don’t think people sub saying screw it. US underwhelming response beginning overwhelming citizens. Partially think it’s “wrong” beginning don’t want wrong it’s best pessimistic. Additionally, fear generates clicks. It’s good people’s mental health—I haven’t school since March miss much, seeing headlines like “Vaccine won’t end pandemic”/“We won’t go back normal till 2024” wreaks extreme havoc mental health young adult. believe covid never fully eradicated hysteria “pandemic” dissipate vaccine readily distributed. Moderna? imagine probably similar results similar vaccines Honey, no. okay.

Sealion gonna sealion going attempt argument good faith she/he/it/they gleefully drop fallacies like sassy bartenders drop salt. 

I know infuriating, remember fighting pigs gets muddy pig likes it. wouldn’t surprised is. Feel free take mine, way I’m going get shot every year. Maybe vaccine tested improved. right, really isolated places It’s “too good.” It’s fact Canada better position India this. it’s embarrassing. It’s akin EU ask UK help. Sure, it’s possible, clearly leadership messed big time. Even better that’s counting already approved! I'm absolutely flabbergasted ashamed many Canadians seem understand *very basic* point.

And Americans dying *significantly* higher rates us Canadians. lost 100,000+ people January alone, that's fucking insane. 

Let keep vaccines try stop deaths. best option preserve *human* life. care less life Houston instead Halifax, people need learn fucking perspective. million vaccinated, 500 Guillain-Barre syndrome vaccine 25 died? 

That sounds bad all. missing?

And honestly think trials sensitive enough pick something rare. fact unable identify anything said actually wrong pretty telling No, quarantine leaks infections. focus currently improving quarantine - ridiculously operated hotels city centres - circuit breakers option quarantine fails.

Yeah well kid school none sitdown restaurant social event year. Correlation something something. 2021? numbers. already 2MM/day days, raise 3 MM/day long vaccine. 100MM per months eventually.

We still beginning ramp still 3rd vaccinated country. Pretty much yes. stipulations well...the nursing homes supposed keep patients isolated wards. complied, problem staff. separate staff wards, thus employees ended spreading virus inside facilities.

However, agree vaccinating world Canada's responsibility, international strategy. kids soooo resilient! tough anything! What's years missed development anyways? ^^/s

It fucking infuriates hearing way people justify fucking millions children's development. get rob vital years lives praise think they'll eventually ok it. That's like stealing wallet thanking adaptable charitable.

Can person get Astra Zeneca J&amp;J vaccine, six months later get pfizer vaccine? believe people stable longer needed hospital care free bed patients. Normally person would discharged home someone long term care home. Newspapers always seem refer POTUS “Mr.” I’m sure why; kind journalistic convention maybe? Yeah, India’s median age little bit lower Latin American countries. Latin American countries also reporting death tolls lot, countries 10x confirmed deaths per population India. Great. one please?  ever tell buttercup.

A thousand wrongs there, whatever helps sleep night. Pfizer actually turned OWS money development stage said it'd slow worldometer US back cases recent day

Thanks advance! Bathtub I'm 22 year old college student. wrong think I'll opportunity vaccinated point May (so basically anywhere 1st-31st, likely closer 31st)? 

I think good bet, personally. around 250 million shots arms may 31st (108 days now).

I really hope can, prospect getting vaccinated 3-3.5 months makes feel like normalcy close. personally plan living life much closer normal last 11 months get full vaccine protection. someone please explain this?  US Vaccine Rollout Schedule:

The idea ""Uggg... bad new? plug ears now!"" way responding reminder keep vigilant. People vaccine arms trials would meet quarantine requirements, fwiw. That's pretty shitty. vaccine poses zero risk. Zero risk better little risk. Especially since vaccines overwhelmingly likely eliminate spread, protecting immunocompromised people risk can’t get vaccine. tradition 🇨🇦

I'm ok *voluntary* mask wearing flu season becoming socially acceptable thing. Anything fuck right off, doubly government tries mandate person tries shame so. Two dose vaccine. assume also want spares account lost/destroyed vaccines US, number I've keeping close eye rate hospital change. vaccinations vulnerable take effect, see begin outspeed case drops. think we're beginning see it. 


Here's percentage hospital drop Wednesday Thursday last five weeks: 


Today: -3.6% 
One week ago: -3.1% 
Two weeks ago: -2.9% 
Three weeks ago: -2.2% 
Four weeks ago: -0.7% 
Five weeks ago: +2.3%  


Cases keep dropping, rate drop pretty flat maybe even decreasing tiniest bit. drop hospitals pulling away it. gap continue grow vaccinations make felt, even \*if\* case plateau higher like, casualty rate continue fall negligible. Woudnt developed countries vaccinated. point getting Canadian taxpayers carry burden vaccinating world. agreed actual fuck. don’t know clinical trial is. Proof second point . ? Bro, Canada ranked 38 vaccines per 100 people. says right article. Per capita. Per 100.  way, source, data vaccines per 100 Australia. like Africa. It’s already given outside trials, case live rock.

Don’t participate trial! get vaccine like almost everybody else! lack vaccines tragic.

But, say behind covid compared USA wrong. Canada’s death rate per capita nearly 1/3 USA’s. USA 20% *of Covid deaths world* despite less 5% world’s population.

I truly believe would well, better Canada, Trump hadn’t president anti-masking covid denialism didn’t take hold huge huge swath population haven’t really heard anything variant transmissible, potent, anything, I’m California. fact, locally UK SA variants concerning. reasonable thought, however would contrast fact data (Of AZ least) shown longer delay doses gives stronger 'net' AB T-cell responses, addition covering population. 

With pfizer still waiting concrete evidence that, ordinary imagine similar effect demonstrated given 3 weeks otherwise unusually short. totally correct. 300% contagious would put 300% people ICU. hospital system can’t handle could well see 10x deaths. Totally agree - convinced period time everyone like “enjoying” (some people like yesss!! lockdowns!!) time continues see narrative shifting turning towards “fine” over, it’s over. say start shifting goal posts summer think people bring rage especially since vaccines shouldn’t excuse. saw doomsday article say won’t back normal 2024 wanted email writer “go f**k yourself” - obviously didn’t gosh hate media much rn negative articles. Fact , dont know. labs US even running database analysis see reinfections problem. Let alone , genetic analysis That's DayQuil ""for.""

Would rather kid labrat experiment they're injected vaccine labrat experiment they're exposed live virus? honestly think live virus going better choice there? Yea even know vaccines? main point tight fit, i. e. air bypasses mask gaps.

If single mask fit tight second one might improve fit. infuriates me. dad constantly saying 99% chance survive. may may true, even survive could lot issues later road. knows mom Covid kinds issues heart it. illegal.

Oh I'm fully board you. would never say wish stayed like forever. want us able beat covid open people go socialize. think mentioned another comment even though need lot socializing, still want able see friends least month go something whether restaurant, museum, park etc.

So I'm definitely one wants push onto everybody. (Although think back 2020 vaccines important us social distance etc saving lives matter), would never support forever think people advocate dumb. 

Where think 2020 taught lesson maybe adopt asian cultures do. somebody gets sick put mask going out. something people Japan, Hong Kong etc done covid. kinda wish here. 

But end socializing still important. Humans social beings even introverts need less it, still dont want zero. Zero socializing bad anyone. lmao moved new jersey south summer, it’s like two totally different planets Yeah bad.

Look way. 100 vaccines sent location sunday. sunday administer 100 vaccines. close since longer vaccines. 100 people received dose sunday. 

Or 

100 vaccines sent location Sunday. Sunday administer 14 doses stop ""vaccinate day"". Monday administer 14 doses stop. repeats day week 100 spread out. 
14 people received dose Sunday. remaining 86 people risk exposure least one additional day be, risk additional 6 days longer needed be.

On hand, USA literally called United States America, pointing fact separated states, uniting. like EU separated european countries uniting. Obviously many differences two, never said they're same, reasoning can't think USA ""country"" traditional sense.

As said above, admid way thinking wrong, mainly thinking size, India bigger anyway, point stand. Thanks this.

This study, interesting discussion, almost comically underpowered. assumptions used wildly different conditions USA. authors acknowledge Limitations section, ignore doozies, loss education life expectancy arising thousands single-parent households orphaned children.

It's certainly worth modeling like this, feel suggesting policies create death, numbers need lot solid. restrictions all. several large events great summer tourists around. home back soon. ""Virus shot"" weird way say ""vaccine"" 😂 tell truth matter examples find against. fact there's bearing current vaccines. could there's prior difference one first one it. maybe many differences crop won't.

The best way think strictly like scientist. guess something important like human health. use data guide. scenario direct data. Give credit credit due.

Sure thing. Nearly half million Americans dead. Thanks Trump. Yeah, like ""health experts"" right suffering dire consequences restrictions that's they're quick spew garbage statements like this. Bad news media...

r/SelfAWarewolves Thanks. realize nickname. Pay wall. seem struggling get deployed. understand US laissez-faire all. easy find get vaccination, struggle. People average lazy stupid. really know expected roughly two months since vaccines approved? supply would endless infrastructure built perfectly right away sustain it? knew along supply would issue, infrastructure always going slugish start pick (if nothing, learning helps). 

You also expect supply continue issue time adjust expectations. There's magic wand... also nothing awful. total “straw man” argument. one ever claimed country vaccine; I’m sharing article it’s good news live US. I'm impressed it. can't even build simple single family home 6 months. Honestly I'm using low risk purposes reuse medical masks time. can't tell everyone actually laundering cloth masks every day. - J&amp;J one dose vector vaccine(half russians one). looks trash nowadays. right booster six months. looks cheap dirty trick J&amp;J get money. sure, immunity six months accept booster. **Correct me, wrong.**

- Pfizer production. Vaccine created BioNTech clear name BNT162b2. 
In months get BioNTech vaccine Novartis, Sanofi, Merck on... **But Pfizer absolutely best big pharma world**. Without Pfizer production two billions doses 2021 would possible.

- Sputnik good vaccine terrible one. Trial phase III mess took place Moscow(still protocol available). enough data data good quality. Additional problem: get Sputnik case soon, domestic production quite limited. 

- Novavax wonder fool, yes. Agree 100%.

P.S. waiting here, Europe CureVac. Despite delay, GSK Bayer signed contracts produce CureVac( partial data III trial phase). understand, excellent news CureVac us all.

ImEveryTuna correct, it’s called “How think like Zeynep Tufecki” w Ezra Klein, calmed nerves  Lol yeah guess karma farming OP get memo sub pivoted wanting bad news wanting good news Even prevent spread (which likely does), severely lowers risk complications reduces hospitalizations, turning COVID minor nuisance  even comorbidity. big deal litter masks everywhere. 

Surgical masks regulated, tested, meet actual standards. cloth mask made anyone, fit range different ways, totally untested unregulated terms public safety far inferior option surgical masks. also breathe much much easier, cloth masks require one layer fabric anything ill fitting decoration face. 

Surgical masks adjusted fit number ways buy types fit better like kn95. buy kids size need to. Really unless kind extraordinarily small face renders unique rare specimen human species, surgical mask big you, like way fits. 

It go high face right underneath eyeballs. way last chin. ear loops tightened. they've got legal liability.

Disney World almost certainly turn away anyone proof vaccination legal exposure. Agreed. ended switching solely medical masks lot easier breathe talk in, dispose done.

Granted lots restrictions already done  What? saying American president put countries first? hand... frankly think children get vaccine -- dangerous side effects, simply necessary children. rationale vaccinating children logical, adults live/work near children already vaccinated. someone good argument it, I've yet hear it.

1-in-17,000 children contract MIS-C virus, 2,000 cases 30 virus deadly children, vaccines kill all. provides cross immunity SA variant, appear case. 'Dominant' relational idea, rather absolute one -- absolute trend SA variant that's thing probably interested in. doctors scientists around world, prior administration, already know that.

There simply comparison. India wore size XL clothing, US wore size M. lost weight. ""average"" American fat metric completely different here.

My mom super fat India hard find western clothes malls. US, find clothes normal stores time. sized women common.  know things fleshed studies, documented obesity decreases influenza vaccine efficiency. Unsure specifically related weight-dose ratio related metabolic syndromes. Yes opposite. plane times 35 years. think even people vulnerable dying flu would want this.  Remember early days people saying we’d 10 million dead US we’d reduced third world country bread riots?

The sub gotten reasonable time people got bored realized isn’t apocalypse. We're still recovering massive crisis caused lies COVID, tens millions Americans still believe. story exactly much Trump lying COVID is, fact, directly relevant national crisis we're *still in*.

And even true, he's former president less month ago, he's still much leader Republican party, extremely likely he's going Republican nominee four years even he's running jail cell. Yes, media still going continue talking him. ah yes, Sweden method: get rid cumbersome old people welfare contributing tax base anymore *climate change entered chat* don’t believe you. weird know could meant. obese

That's bit exaggeration, middle class Indians tend fat tummys prone diabetes etc. vaccine last February. do. He's talking SoCal.

But applying California. Serum 50m+ doses sitting idle. say supply issue?

It's due farce done Covaxxin health care workers willing show up. Yeah, that's earliest seems feasible, outlined, probably like early-to-mid summer.

Unless there's major hiccup vaccinations, absolutely masking song dance fall.

(ETA: least, defined mandates. People voluntarily want.) work basically petri dish.  know optics. brought things light. unhygienic are. sloppy are. many people work worked sick. included.  hope mess leads us smarter. sick, stay home. moment upgrade perk mutate virus Plague Inc. doesn’t slow vaccine progress. Russians amazing scientists engineers, accustomed working limited resources, due much budgets embezzled superiors Moscow. people health issues every flu season? Whatever again. Seems happen lot countries like VN NZ though. “And regardless uncertainty parameters, tell 50% transmission happening community people without symptoms ­— asymptomatic pre-symptomatic.” governments paid it. It’s nothing compared money loosing everyday lockdowns people getting sick.

Our governments dropped ball large. What's point trials government body going ignore science whatever want?

It's really stupid suggestion change things now, imo. paper quite outlier. suggesting 85% cases aymptomatic?

That properly classify pre-symptomatic vs asymptomatic means useless. I’ve heard anecdotally Moderna vaccine worse side effects/pain anecdotal. Governments paid every drug company testing vaccine build dozens plants it. would've cost much, much less lockdown stimulus checks. Another study separate truly asymptomatic cases presymptomatic cases. USA allow export issues getting ingredients. would EU different?

The billion people support enable CCP. Last time checked pretty happy government. Maybe time hold officials responsible. 

Supposedly china also handling well now. need vaccines badly? thought vaccine works well.  200 million people (400 million doses) amount previously secured. 

His administration secured extra 200 million DOSES - additional 100 million people vaccinated.

That means 300 million doses 200 million people... Novavax candidate. Heh might you. whole process fucking young generation more. disgusting  wording suggests, they’re including “asymptomatic” “pre-symptomatic” people. really wonder splits two. get around government relent restrictions? worry people going go along whatever government says. 36 people 31 million vaccinated far? It’s terrible loss, people seriously think vaccines come without risk harmful issues? don’t think fact .000001 % people affected cause anyone actually fear vaccine. Nah, usually enough elicit ""remote island nation"" response hit target quota. want work hard. dat mRNA vaccine goodness Would rather dead people dead people? understanding Avro Nortel situations vast oversimplification. blaming NDP instituting program UCP shut down? 

I hard time seeing credibility ""all parties suck"" types ever seem focus one side spectrum. lol thanks. Glad here. Kind of... sure... go immunology. really feel like old life ransomed back me, like I'm compelled take vaccine duress. appreciate feeling. also forced hard fast lockdown ignored health expenditure 4 ICUs available beginning pandemic. 

Literally making up. ICU availability single digits. kind seeding major countries got would people suffocating homes. fs understand humbling experience, I'm Indian descent lived US entire life. people need start recognizing India potential holds stop looking upon ""behind"" Australia frighteningly authoritarian COVID. 2020 showed much citizens willing, eager put with. find scary. Longterm data please 4 dead ohio? many more? imagine USA end giving away tens millions doses done. using Sweden example? wide spread mask wearing Sweden, also Swedish people compliant regulations around social distancing, mask wearing, limiting gatherings. I’m pretty sure China making tons stuff EU needs make vaccine EU stops exporting, China end one get vaccine. Export sending finished product. Also even suggest Chinese authorities handled beginning pandemic wrong, literally billion people innocent this, fair chance vaccines. It’s bit occasional though Australia. I’m country also handled well don’t near many “leaks” quarantine facilities. Jokes them, can't read It’s like Florida man thing. Florida much crazier states: it’s easier find it.  Oh fuck's sake. right cares mental health, gives left excuse *not* care mental health?

I'm fucking miserable right really patience hear one fucking person try downplay struggles people playing partisan politics. Mental health important. matter party vote for, serious pandemic we're in. right say matter convenient you. friend.. problem. Blame *all* parties whole. 
Do blame Conservatives, blame UCP, blame NDP.
Blame *all* parties whole.

It trick, big lie. Politicians people. Politicians people fund them.

I also tell nations abilities dismantled last 50 years. 

We would become leaders aviation. Lobbyist USA fed politicians enough money shut would leader Telecommunications, time, trade secrets stolen China, support Canadian Government. Alberta, NDP elected. 4 years start program going help lot Canadians.

What happened? releases program 6-8 months office. holding card re-election? promise got elected. Or, know way out, adding program people would able benefit long next administration would shut down?

You understand happens politics. get excited programs government going provide people... this, taking away programs benefited individuals. (Without telling public removed)   sounds like awful way live. Cash king. 10 months develop system

they literally made one vaccine got approved, take work I'm unemployed, live alone, spend every day lifting, playing video games, browsing Reddit hoping God shit ends soon. I've also developed addictions porn alcohol. miss interacting people. want meet new people, isolation good mentally. I'm lonely depressed ever COVID. Online interactions substitute real-life interactions, certainly substitute in-person dating.

It's good fine, please get idea everyone well you. Got source that? think people talking transition period probably summer end fall everyone gets vaccinated world opens back up. 

This sub acts weird sometime, kind suggestion things might go 100 percent back normal June 1st get completely bent shape. 

I think everyone expects world go back normal point semi near future. probably won’t going music festivals late fall earliest. efficacy 100 % Except free movement human right lol, sorry zero chance USA use advantage. cost us EU one way another. fascinating. yes, sadly believable.

""if prevent Covid-19, posting social media"" Good way spend money pandemic.

Frontline healthcare workers doses, long term care residents area current outbreak least 1 dose (they're closed visitors now), northern communities vaccinated. 

We 50 cases today yesterday. 20 20. went 14 active cases last weekend like 260 now. least half new cases 20 probably like 2/3s. He's mainly referring here, sees need set example even though he's fully vaccinated.  said problem US - means police world's largest military very, easily.

Do doubt this? absolutely criticizing Trump rollout issues. storage temperature Pfizer vaccine known distributed. 

Trump's team robust plan get shots arms. know else say that. miss December target 85%, fewer 50% distributed vaccines administered. relying states build networks without providing funding states thing.

The Biden team made tons changes, today actually rolling million doses directly pharmacies, point rate vaccinations accelerated change administration. point current rate vaccinations rate month ago, Trump's team schruted hard. took act congress get money states, instance. Yeah, quite bit difference NY, especially around metro area, vs. Florida haha think it'd costly public spaces put permanent handwashing/sanitiser facilities entrances, considering cost things they've pandemic atm. That's bit doom gloom. Perhaps true, unlikely. vaccine required less month developed. rest time approval, fast-tracked. flu vaccine take year approved, depite new variants.

We get 90% immunity summer/fall two reasons. First, approved children pregnant women. alone means many 75% vaccinated. Second, many people refusing it. I'd surprised hit 50% vaccination US countries large percentage morons children. So, would take results mean vaccine could provide level protection sooner two weeks takes first shot take effect? would good news true! People misuse 'genocide' score internet points dumb brick one one dropped feet. tired people attempting sound smart totally unappropriate ahistorical references intentionally hyped word choices. True; guess better way say would “figure timeline safest way remove recommendations.”

Not Biontech/Pfizer vaccine, though. Smart people talk still believe aerosols linger air while.

I wear mask outdoors right now, go running biking. I'm parent I've worried kids (4y, 5mo). even hope now. adults access summer. think going vaccinating first graders Fall. That's amazing! 

Soon enough, they'll get kids worry every cold might covid. oldest wear mask first grade. baby remember anyone ever did!

Hang there. I'm hoping enough get vaccinated take outdoor festivals summer. :) stated another response, jumped gun making seem like Canada. Nova Scotia really bad. choice have, stay socially distanced forever constantly playing catchup mutations? always wonder many people actually comfortable vs faking it.

Sourh African variant think reinfection much likely it. We've already seen ability reduce vaccine efficiency. We've found greatly reduces efficiency mild moderate symptoms AZ Nissan/J&amp;J reported lower efficiency variant. sure would different natural immunity Africa uniquely prepared comes dealing things like this, ebola taught alot. 

This worrying see though. Indoor meetings things like indoor lunches simply done anymore, least bigger places (F500). Correct I'm wrong, even though Covid-19 vaccine RNA Vaccine, still aim produce immune response, 2 dose recommended body build sufficient resistance time.

If already got virus system already response (is possible different one ?), recommendation seem odd. One problem could quite difficult 100% certain indeed got infected (as tests beginning quite dubious).

 yeah vaccine companies like it, still companies sell product all, sell better (for them). pangolin lobby China strong /S Well JAMA says it’s safe consider it. right advise it.  saying along B.1.1.7 least 90% politics, along rest variant fever. hospital employees already stopped wearing masks outside work.

Bottle count reduction would lead efficiencies supply chain distribution (speed). it’s # bottles x% bottle, that’s net gain using supply chain. either way it’s boost. Best Buy near changed hours three times last 11 months. idea why. Maybe things going expected enough people enrolled now? NovaVax still enrolling people US. CureVac already vaccinated thousands Netherlands alone December trials. since Netherlands biggest surge cases since start pandemic. Netherlands country trial running. CureVac expects enough data entering phase 3 data results somewhere later Q1. took around 1 month approval vaccine since release interim phase 3 trials. keep hearing news purchases, larger supply, etc., LA still can't get enough vaccine, shut multiple mass vaccination locations due lack supply. disconnect things? We're mid-February still feel like vaccination rates significantly ramped here. full comment say? AZ J&amp;J next couple weeks novavax sometime April seem likely? trying feels reals right now? 2 hours post vaccine. Area looks fine, redness blotchiness. Arm's bit sore that's expected im getting moderna shot 3 hours headlines absolutely suck already shaky confidence  Must mobile issue... Proportionally deaths per infection much higher then; learned things since lot young people getting infected recover better also.  That's interesting question might make good discussion thread itself.

Probably biggest difference people decided remove elderly loved ones nursing homes. possible saved life.

And there's lot people making small personal decisions. I'm Chinese-American saw lot elderly Chinese people begin mask public long shutdowns, definitely mask mandates. Statistically, least old people saved lives prevented hospital trip. (Or least catching flu bad flu year.)

Then there's people smart enough voluntarily cancel January/February cruise trips, avoiding least quarantine hell sea.

If forethought sign grocery delivery meal kit delivery boxes early, March came around, nearly impossible sign up.

At time panicked, advisories socially distancing articles pre-shutdown scary enough made minor voluntary changes, like deciding hike weekends rather taking subway indoor cultural events city. accomplish anything? I'll never know. nice hikes get covid. UK started vaccinating faster world watching. Plus saying jab way faster US word. mine going bonfire point year.

I get public health generally local pandemic feds organizing. random number generation took ""a tenth"" claim?  likely strategic. vaccines require least one booster, needing two shots given.

Honestly, come conclusion?

Florida big state large population centers. also old state. they've open states US.

By logic, amongst hardest hit, they're not. data suggests otherwise? News sources state schools reopen march 8th. Theyre already 20 percent done deaths reduced fourty percent since three weeks ago (their peak) Yes really, dumb hot take genocide. makes think even know genocide is, cheapens died real genocides. british slang. Clearly britain's soft culture power strong ! Ehh yeah, doses ordered doses delivered. Germany example still nearly enough vaccine, EU German government totally fucked one. sell short. may something. could debate morality decision export fact matter US worst outbreak need everything get contain
Due aggressive nature population likely could implement multiple lockdowns like EU Israel. 
The type lockdowns seeing Europe would’ve likely resulted armed protests capitols across country mass looting. curious Dutch already accounted vaccines. already assumed receive 21,9 million Q2 top 4,4 million vaccines Q1 (+ december 2020). 21,9 million 7,8 million BioNTech. numbers 2nd February. stick another ~2 million top that, would awesome. Bringing Q2 BioNTech deliveries around 10 million. deliveries already quite high, assume already accounted increased deliveries sadly. hope see ramp seems like pretty linear far admins, course weeks hopefully bidens actions kick soon see increase.  paper: number unaddressed questions. going look vitamin C vs standard care know zinc might doing.

1) Table 1 shows ~2x many standard care patients taking antipyretics, NSAIDS, bronchodilators vs vitamin C group. treatments affect symptom score based fever, cough, shortness breath, fatigue?

2) original plan supposed able detect difference one day time 50% symptom reduction, stopped study early ~40% expected number patients. Table 2 shows standard care took 6.7 days average vs 5.5 days ascorbic acid. results would consistent benefit due vitamin c primary endpoint expected number subjects. Basically ""no benefit"" due small sample size.

3) Figure 3 show apparent benefit vitamin C time treatment stopped (10 days). 5/48 (10%) patients reached primary endpoint vs 14/50 (28%) standard care. know would stop giving treatment even patient still symptoms. seems correct timepoint compare.

4) Baseline 4-component score 4.0 groups. represents mild symptoms begin with, wonder many even vitamin deficiency.

Basically, vitamin C looking promising ended study small sample size misinterpret lack statistical significance benefit. also ignore much higher percentage people taking drugs meant reduce symptoms standard care group. think person claiming isn’t happening experiencing it. 

Why fuck downvoted reporting different experience?!

Fuck. It’s hard enough people wanting get eligible people vaccinated, lot punishing merely expressing really shitty. Nothing, except attempt coup, whatever. D? Rumors say Queen Elizabeth got vaccine decades ago probably one dose shot that's two weeks away approved access already expanded include essential workers age group bigger vectors spread life is...normal? we'll see long citizens New York, New Jersey, Michigan, California willing put that. really. deliberately let people die it’s really far off. yes. whiskey posting dont mix well
Still, upper bound efficacy severe infection. aint 100% sold recently though still good. Oh shit real? see snippet news overseas claim whole story. That's fantastic good guys! point, states vaccinated young people unless healthcare worker, comorbidity, etc.

I'd guess assumption get around vaccinated healthy 20somethings, we'll point we're longer facing supply shortages. Thank you! making false statements fair, sure act like bunch ignorant fucks comes Covid. apparently i'm going become eligible vaccine person underlying health condition current state exact day i'm moving new state given indication they're going expand access group... fuck guess  really hate sub. Every time someone expresses problems finding vaccine get downvoted oblivion everyone saying got there’s diametrically upvoted. That's one! Thank you! explain Macron waited 2021 say anything it. specifically donald do? Harvey Specter make enough either ... countless news reports, documentaries, podcasts plus friends family overseas I've personally spoken to.

Honestly watch news really know pandemic happening Miami. enjoy world fear. difference live democracy...If people wanted leave bad, Government would change decision then, yes. families fucked. That's point. can't afford constant PCR testing quarantine hotels. wish people would admit reality non-Western families years come. Immigrant families told shove it.

Oh don’t worry, we’re Australians, we’ve *for years* also fact many people already infected, also naturally lead decreased new cases. latest survey Delhi showed seropositive rates slightly 50%.  matter neck woods what's secured. County max number facilities opened throughout, numbers moved 20% since middle January. can't more. rate, take 10 months vax adults County. addition pharmacies, let's reduce 7 months best. That's early September everyone. I'm savvy what's happening here, see nothing mentioned speed up. ""excess death"" argument could 100% twisted apply flu coming years since essentially eradicated season COVID measures. hope going forward, countries latch onto lockdowns cure-all disease, instead invest public health infrastructure stop allowing nursing homes care facilities become death camps.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Twisting loops kn95 gives tight fit. twist, there's gaps.  Key word: COULD Hey, might gotten memo sub hates data science now. said appreciate taking time provide numbers don’t let people whining lockdowns make feel crazy super spreading event occurs, masking. 

Period. 

They taking fake safety measures include masking.

Had worn even simple masks, together good handwashing protocols, large super spreading event becomes impossible.

Surely, infection happen even masks, cut infections huge.

Masks work, except people wear them. work.

Sounds like nonsense actual scientific truth. Trudeau brown face made call? I’ll state unpopular opinion makes little difference vaccine roll out. include J&amp;J, already enough vaccines jab everybody. I’m saying it’s bad thing—there may unexpected delays one vaccine help cover fit. expectation we’re gonna need doses. said September likely start school then. even argue prob make kids go back school w w/o vaccinations bc lot adults vaccinated risk lower. Maybe wear mask receive vaccinations 👍🏼 doubt win they’re CEOs/founders company. understanding companies don’t get Nobel prizes. 

Didn’t Orhan Pamuk get Nobel Prize? Well seems probably circulating China October 2019 maybe even before, hardly shocker. news indicates transmissibility rates increasing 150% UK, besides increase transmissibility, ZA variant virulence increase. apparently Amazonian variant 300% infectious. 

I link Fed's saying double mask asap related expected increases. also think 30% masking it, panic consequences stare face. masking thus would/will get gift infection. know nearly 80 year old who's ""waiting see negative side effects vax."" count injured, potentially severely. missionaries almost certainly several vaccinations traveling Amazon god figured prevent malaria. hey, maybe telling truth happens world's epidemiologist never seen measles. like everyone forgot tell whole life. hypothesis might accurate funny i'm running Ugh twisted ear loops bother much. 

I work dental always wear them, nothing new me. Mask wearing never bothered way.

I heard people twisting thought weird. tried today see felt terrible, wasn’t even able wear like full 5 seconds. don’t see people think it’s better. made mask tighter ears opened sides mask you’re breathing everything in, letting air/particles escape. 

It’s much easier wear mask correctly leave alone. Pulling talk expose nose “breathe better” much work. touch masks infrequently forget even time I’m honest. Netherlands really lockdown past late autumn. choose us example. Queen w Adam Lambert UK Europe tour 2020, rescheduled 2021 rescheduled 2022. 

The first move dates almost matched. move dates got little weird.

[QAL moved need advice. haven’t met anyone outside household without mask since pandemic hit. got new job boss called suddenly said planned team lunch next week. panic wanting accepted new workplace, said “sure sounds good.” sound good freaking out. don’t want meet others mask off. go this? Take risk? cancel? still don’t think group get vaccine another without scientific evidence vulnerable. much feel people things, isn’t relevant this.  looking capitalistic view point there's zero chance summer somewhat normal. I'm willing bet end April - May everything packed again.

So necessarily disagree things like concerts marathons canceled right now. planning prep. know rules even going staged, generally going cancel event. 

Right now, lots parents trying figure summer camps (most canceled last year) sure camps want open states loosen rules (and air), many camps open. And, likely many camps close good 2 years revenue. everyone freaking Biden saying masks thru 2022: addressing room full hospital / healthcare workers regards medical facility safety. He’s addressing average citizen. We’re fine lol think Trump administration whole lot things wrong regards COVID, aggressively funding vaccine research production, setting aggressive targets vaccines would available among mistakes. Many countries red tiny elderly population need fraction vaccines countries blue need.

At time, paranoia anxiety around covid means politicians decision makers cannot make choice vaccinating risk groups sharing around. common belief covid airborne ebola every young, healthy person needs vaccine. environment, relinquishing possibility vaccinating risk people poorer countries vaccinate risk groups longer common sense, stops short treason. 

So really complicated situation rich countries greedy here.

What really could stop enforcing intellectual property rights vaccines allow poor countries produce them. win win situation. Solves problem involves begging dependence. last thing happen anyone background epidemiology explain means? Wonder vaccine companies think this. Note one-shot vaccine (i.e. J&amp;J), instead one shot two-dose vaccine. Given results Pfizer yesterday showing two doses necessary proper protection variants, wonder sensible is. parents thatare 100% aware risk kid spreading them, making personal decision? issue unsafe people know know unsafe near you. It’s spreading outside bubble people don’t want burden risk

Ultimately someone masking traveling parents wrong parent getting it, given parents choosing grown adult expose themself sake social connection 

The infantilization elderly rather silly harmful. old person wants see kid pandemic illness puts risk, that’s completely choice. **Immune system**"";""Heeeey,I know you. Get um boys!"" lockdown till Summer! political power, funds forcing lockdowns everything fully focused vaccination - including training people produce vaccines since production seems bottleneck right now. politians proved iq 100. Well, they're *wrong.* Regarding COVID-19 infection rates: month ago say see real impact Christmas start seen first week February.

It looks like wave Christmas New Years cases peaked first two weeks January. CDC's graph COVID-19 cases found here: doom forecasters, lol. mid summer Oz like..... 

You start small time. can't go STRAIGHT federal medical fraud! 14-dose vial load could increase nation’s vaccine supply much 20 percent time governors clamoring vaccine contagious variants coronavirus believed spreading people familiar Moderna’s manufacturing, spoke condition anonymity, said retooling company’s production lines accommodate change could conceivably done fewer 10 weeks, end April. amount liquid vial would change, vials would remain size, production process would drastically change. cant comment rest saying, coronaviruses don’t refer specifically covid-19, coronaviruses like SARs. lot research diseases actually transferred (Pfizer working SARs vaccine pandemic). matter catching every border crossing. matter stopping new mutations, statistically still present people. That’s good know, commenting air travel didn’t realise land borders closed  growing extra arm

That’s hilarious lmao That's he's saying. course higher regions. basically pandemic March areas. Northeast, especially NYC, hospitalization rates lower March 2020 factor 3-4. Five-day? said 14-day march 2020 know happened … so, it’s easy guess going. states, infinitesimal increase cannot noticed. Oh no, absolutely understand Canada making difficult travel now, even legitimate reasons it. trying answer question re-entering US Canadian citizen. cause get many people US vaccinated quickly possible. There's guarantee things go exactly according plan, that's redundancies. travel US back plane you’re Canadian Mexican, provided get negative PCR test traveling. It’s land borders closed since March it’s unlikely change anytime soon.

Mexican borders remained fully open pandemic. Maybe Marcon unpopular tells truth.

Or large part responsible vaccination delays insisted buying French vaccines instead German ones. UK variant going take overwhelm system, would first place see that?

Is fair say? That's model response look like! Check Australia's numbers comparison. There's weird trend internet people notice something understand (like people getting covid vaccinated) instead correctly assuming lack understanding cause confusing observation assume conspiracy malice. People spreading intentional misinformation help people total lack intellectual humility bury good information spreading it. Floridian here, rules they're enforced mainly corporations local governments, state government. yes possible like flu. maybe future go flu corona shot states better decision federal government overstepping rights

Abdicating responsibility guise offering flexibility states. theme throughout Covid. eager top it, US, almost definitely will! Maybe even sooner! great news. However, I’m curious occurred France instead South Africa variant came from. Surely must similar possibilities someone SA previously COVID become exposed possibly reinfected severe symptoms. Yet kind news hasn’t come SA yet. He’s saying Israel vaccinated way people Jordan, mortality dropping faster Israel Jordan, appears claim that’s case. Pretty well paid like NZ/Aus governments did. land borders closed. you’re traveling plane there’re restrictions except need get PCR test board flight. Covid won... May well end society give planet dolphins. consider education important enough accept risks, yes. point - vaccines, etc - allow us fully entire lives back normal? Shit happens, mean can't reasonable things make less shit happen, like wearing masks wearing seatbelts.

Yeah,I know truly fair, *always* going need seatbelts, always need masks. Faster market, faster full effectiveness. Even could stretched, bother way lengthening study time? 

We question theory would way now, also vaccine that's months. think way reasonable. Given guys direct exposure, according CDC, operate assumption caught quarantine next 14 days: testing, get tested couple times, **a negative test mean negative!** recent study suggests false negative rates (e.g. negative test actually positive) **\~30% higher** week exposure, asymptomatic.

So TL;DR, **assume caught quarantine 14 days even get negative test.**

Testing study link (see Figure 3B): I’m beginning think may actually get vaccinated summer! due vaccines wave starting decline again? Concerts illegal Illinois. 

Guess stop fussing now. believe there's restrictions entering US Mexico Canada

I know giving factual information, Canada that's problem. American can't get Canada, oh well, got it. Canadian going US easy, sure, getting back Canada expensive/time-consuming. used quarantine 14 days going back in. quarantine three days hotel, expense apparently *very* expensive.

So intents purposes, there's social travel betweenthe two countries Canada makes hard. also expect see ppl trying cross border get vaccinated neighboring countries neighbors start vaccine roll out. Absolutely. 

For kids find areas government shut everything long periods time, decisions government difficult, long lasting effects. 

Those effects caused tragedy. Anything trigger mental illness child. happens, shouldn’t fucking news story face shouldn’t plastered across world people use prop. Yup, total fucking bullshit. I'm supposed mask check mail. neighbors chance seeing someone walking road zero. hang bar restaurant without one hours. 

Total fucking clownery. security theater, quite honestly, makes question rules place. time vaccine available healthy young individuals probably enough supply measure completely unnecessary. Anyone isn’t childish anti-authority contrarian, yes.  Given Trump's propensity lying everything, surprise me. I'm implying it, I'm stating unequivocally. 12 year olds taught sex education, taught complex math, expected chores help care siblings mature enough conversation whether they're bad thoughts struggles? Give break. Well, someone EU bother. Again. Big Japan concerned CDC plan reopening schools include high schoolers still requires masks / distancing / recess possibly closing cases high locality. getting late vaccinating elderly mention actions end. people quarantine? mixing community soon?

Places like Singapore, NZ, China, etc. problem, there's something wrong AUS system. prediction coming true, we'd hit first 2 mil update early/mid Feb. consistently 2 mil end Feb early March. that's without j j !

This evil. know lot dooming Biden's statement (the guy long history gaffes), honestly, can't see much sociological case mandatory masking year. current trends continue (even factoring variant bump spring), can't see masking anywhere near common June, even big cities. main exceptions think medical facilities, airplanes, *maybe* public transit, though see first two loosening next year, latter q3 year.

Tbh really wasn’t hard. Pretty much discount minimize deaths covid person already underlying conditions right? great aunt passed recently taken ventilator. got nursing home **mid January**. mid 90s we've preparing passing mentally awhile, I'm still livid. Catching *nursing home* vaccinations rolling out. feel bad grandma, lost last sibling, close :( realize many people world able work home? speak privileged viewpoint. Yet are't allowed complain seems. Explain Article 16 ended study early? suck explaining reality enough supply give everyone proper 2-dose regimen actually tested clinical trials.

Better go know works, take risk one-shot strategy significantly less data (especially re: long protection lasts one shot).

EDIT: **way behind** manufacturing might different story. given matter months, think better wait. non-US countries slower rollouts might want make different choice. see value delaying controlling surge? yah, although since covid appears able form source populations animals may rather hard one ever remove. mmm... timeline getting little here, definitions.

Hitler never majority votes. Germany became dictatorship unable freely express political opinion.
Post war actively purged Nazi party, point many symbols still illegal.

How way claim Hitler ""majority support""?
Please present evidence claim. joke,  Im sure 60% covid related deaths covid! really hopeless lot this. positive messaging seen. bother then? wonder know many taken lives last year. still 22 million unused doses states. 

Some states truly running out, many still using supply efficient manner. isn’t works. Lockdowns politically unpopular economically damaging used regularly, governments mostly shown even Covid willing lockdown hard hospitals threatened path threatened. already measures place flu-related hospital surges. Exactly problem, funded things gave cool name forgot existed. vaccine arrived like first they've heard vaccine coming. lazy journalism. two second Google search shows hardly notable. notorious anti vax also guess missed 100% protective death part.... visibly bad faith EMA. ideal world answer live multi generational household, elderly vaccinated isolate 2 weeks? complicated.

There evidence suggest came lab.

The hypothesis came lab can't ruled out. idea behind warp speed sounds nice actually do? first world countries pre bought doses. main issue bet kind domestic manufacturing power had. go lucky countries got choices praising UK, Israel.

My main issue warp speed feels like plan stopped giving money cool name. appears zero plan vaccine distribution. think one ""possible likely"" situations. one accurately predict new variant's impact. definitely gained huge grounds UK, probably Israel, seem spreading fast elsewhere. know why. mind trying re-open see works, government already said pull plug re-opening work. work medical field? able get vaccine? Same.

Never mind years preceding it. can’t reason left lol stop trying Covid sudden death syndrome, chain escalating events resulting pneumonia/severe inflamation death. vaccines prevent chain reaching far. Ooh California You’re welcome son! ❤️ Google it. find anything substance. SA needs Pfizer J&amp;J vaccines EU does, AZ still effective Europe. note sluggish vaccination program broadly equivalent relaxing restrictions soon, epidemiologically speaking. can't read Hebrew know guy saying 38 comes from. study article 523,000 vaccinated people, meanwhile 6 million vaccinated total. Could studies, people, maybe deaths vaccination took effect, knows what. How? got first shot week think, despite doom gloom that's around, remind vaccinations way out. that, moving us closer end point. also think see talking points around transmission change bit data. doctor follow various social media said likely reduce transmission, need data scientists say sure.

So believe relief coming. need give bit longer...even feels really difficult given long thing.

I think also make personal choices. father-in-law late stage lung cancer lives side country husband I. flew see August flying durinn COVID fun. vaccinated, planning try get husband (so long would actually able see him). still take safety precautions okay getting plane vaccination. That's something looking forward right now. Operation ""let's kill 500,000 fucking people unnecessarily"" test well audiences. recommendations vaccinated people already starting relax, CDC updated guidelines yesterday, fully vaccinated people longer need self-isolate exposed. relaxation guidelines come near future evidence pile up/more people get vaccinated. Imagine mandated masks employees, force double mask buy high-grade one expense. sick leave. 😬 Really? Good. Az junk Technically correct, [the advanced (with respect testing) inactivated virus vaccines Chinese confident still provides excellent T-cell immunity. prevented severe illness death, matters. Fuck, even NZ beats us, come Aus, get fuck moving. like Israel. Curious, parents vaccinate young? Assuming 100% people exposed virus.... ""may be,"" Yep can't wait headline ""Israelis get sick even vaccination"". Trump, again? Sorry, blocked fair percentage memory last four years struggling remember : ) /s 7 co-workers got second shots, Pfizer: 3 felt nothing arm pain, 2 fever/chills 1-2 days, 2 fatigue, 1 bad headache thought maybe wine/hot-tub vaccine, lol. 

On first shots, 1 person chills, everyone else arm pain. Governments crack employers, especially America, coerce employees come sick. includes mandated paid sick leave.

Yeah, devil-in-the-details thing think people gloss wax poetic wonderful would ""normalize"" masks going forward.

""Boss, can't come today, I'm sick.""  
""The hell mean? wear mask come work!""

Survey says: Probably r/theydidthemath make seem like big deal since downplayed seriousness Covid last year.  google it? started shit “i think” didn’t work yalls. got news reddit thingy vaguely referring AZ? respected. published. gives EU priority. AZ making best reasonable efforts supply.  want! 98 people got virus fully vaccinated outbreak single hospital spa senior believe Pfizer propaganda mean, Taiwan 40 deaths per million west 1,000+. 

Vietnam 20. I'm saying magical immunity melts COVID. I'm saying maybe spread quite easily thus possible control. Yeah. countries want review data aren’t Russia. Hooray!!!!!👏👏👏 Yep sums situation nicely. They’re putting responsibility poor middle class “stay home save lives” rich, privileged white men like Gavin Newsom Bill Gates live comfortably regardless continue getting paychecks

These rich pampered people think long they’re affected, locking eradicate flu worth it.  agree socially accepted requirements? could see coastal localities that.  agree.  I'm going say pandemic fault falconboy2019. Yes, that's right, I'm holding personally responsible.

That's really based facts, care, never convince otherwise. Got 2nd Pfizer Tuesday. 

Piss covid big one, would really rustle jimmies. 


I pray I'll dead then. big one hits 40 years I'm 70's, well damn. Amen! say? it’s delete sure? heard Astra Vaccines rollout got cancelled  Wel corresponding successful EU program US weird 2-3 week dead space seeing boxes vaccine ship loading docks states starting visibly mobilize week people knew actually getting scheduled. assuming dead space hospital workers getting vaccinated likely didn’t lot public visibility.  would assume anyone tests positive counts infected. hope one good thing come redesign hygiene facilities (e.g. sinks) public/private places. walk building get place wash hands, restroom doors swing outwards (so push open leaving), etc. I've quite grateful chilly flat bathroom sink right next front door - walk house clean hands get home. 🐑   🐑   🐑   🐑   🐑   🐑 correct I'm going cancel. actually really excited schedule first jab. spent last year building mind getting vaccinated would ""the end pandemic"". guess bubble burst bit real.

As vaccine becomes widely available, people experience this. many cases young people feel sicker vaccine would covid. Yes know immunity vaccines stronger natural immunity, vaccine much safer virus etc.. young healthy person hears bad stories vaccine, would risk it? real personal benefit (still mask distance) metrics place # vaccinations needed reopening. problem sooner people think, another blatant goal public health officials. UK started giving first shots vulnerable whereas Isreal far much ahead plus given lot second shots well. UK 2-3 months behind level. What? Number people hospitals number people Ventilators decreased yesterday today? too. I’m tier 4 (out 5) state. announced they’ll probably start tier 2 March 10. Yay. Oh well, May June better fall.

Gotta love cashier busy state run place classed “essential” tier you’re grocery store. save lot lives requiring people eat certain foods only. can't stuff like that. still issues. normal. immune system fucking reason. proves there's actual reduction flu, simply miscounting flu covid. True point good preliminary numbers let’s wait see month two know it’s higher, lower, trial results. good stuff either way came unexpectedly. prepared it. are. everything fight this, return normal. gotta patience. fact vaccines less year remarkable own. joking right? contributing factor public health officials media message vaccine. get wrong. Plenty stupid people to. fight till may dying breath new reality. Whatever takes I'm northern California. LA unified say want. Bidem Newsome wants kids back school want soon. also slippery slope CTA already come assured us making vaccinations mandatory teachers, make mandatory students? 100% Unbiased study. move potentially frees J&amp;J vaccines countries couldn’t afford infrastructure administer mRNA vaccines though. need get whole world vaccinated ASAP new strains stop evolving. vaccinated yet... Lol, clickbait though, holy crap.

Last Thursday saw 124k cases, Thursday saw 103k cases.

Of course comparing Thursday Wednesday show increase like almost every single week since beginning pandemic... means almost nothing don’t control group compare to. Good sign still though. Read article say plan blueprint

""We're certainly starting scratch, activity going distribution""

Fauci manages lots people working ass last year. said plan would throwing people bus. hedge statement grunts working feel bad. 

He made statement January like shit scratch already vaccinating month.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* *Please* ensure keep vaccine appointment. literally shining beacon hope right there. smug talking heads world can't change that.

Remember lot guidance post vaccination behavior based around principle ""better safe sorry"" *factually* going change data comes people vaccinated.

Even though there's good reason believe vaccines severely limit eliminate transmission, known sure, experts err side caution. prevent Scenario A: Person X vaccinated, goes back full normal behavior, still passes virus Person got shot yet, therefore becoming potential severe case/death.

But data rolls in, likely back concept transmission issue someone vaccinated, guidance change. Also keep mind people get shot, even *worst case* Scenario fall apart Person X Person eventually shot, rendering virus useless.  don’t They're individual, difference population could mean true herd immunity sort equilibrium immune system leads 5th, relatively benign endemic human coronavirus seasonal killer scale yet determined. 0 deaths per X cases = 0% mortality rate. need everybody catch it. lot people, go 0 100. First March, virus ""virtually non existent"" ""after 15 cases close zero"" such. 2 weeks later, people stuck home schools closed. Life stopped. week later, record unemployment rates.

So maybe people expect go came. Like door closes opens; Instantaneous. However like building collapsing rebuilt Right! don’t understand wouldn’t get needle (but I’m downvoted, obviously people thoughts) honestly heard age limit vaccine 🤷🏽‍♀️  months, control group continues piling cases - change much, though I'm sure get weird statistical effects ever-changing infection rate combined ever-changing immunity rate. 

Say 1/1,000 unvaccinated people catch per week vs 1/100,000 vaccinated - wait month roughly 400 vs roughly 4, two months roughly 800 vs roughly 8, etc. guess anything would slowly water effects first weeks converge slightly higher effectiveness. understanding EU contract specifies accept vaccines manufactured within EU UK without requiring special approval bloc (quite common factories require audits etc order sell EU alternative global sites may this). coming via Middle East there’s good chance manufactured site India therefore outside remit AZ/EU agreement would require commission approve use across whole bloc, whereas individual countries could make choice quickly.

Just theory, read plant India amazing work vaccines. coronavirus pandemic potential lead increase inequality almost every country once, first time happened since records began. virus exposed, fed increased existing inequalities wealth, gender race. two million people died, hundreds millions people forced poverty many richest – individuals corporations – thriving. Billionaire fortunes returned pre-pandemic highs nine months, recovery world’s poorest people could take crisis exposed collective frailty inability deeply unequal economy work all. Yet also shown us vital importance government action protect health livelihoods. Transformative policies seemed unthinkable crisis suddenly shown possible. return before. Instead, citizens governments must act urgency create equal sustainable world.

Whomever behind this... hope find person. hope prosecute person (that's difficult they're actually abroad). hope lock person decades chance parole. attempted murder mass scale: millions fake masks, thousands medical workers would've infected, least would've died.

This similar case 2008 someone China diluted baby formula random crap. 300,000 babies affected. 54,000 hospitalized. 6 died. particular case, 2 people got sentenced death. others got decades prison. vaccine contagious, asking. contain virus. holy shit described every girl small town grew lmao. still worth noting people manifesting symptoms making majority spread, even might develop symptoms later time. 

Yes case, asymptomatic infections make ~30% infections, attack rates 5 times lower, 6% overall spread.

Attack rates presymptomatic estimated ~40%.

Therefore looking symptomless spread 46%. isolate sick halve reproduction number. reproduction number 1.3 would achieved herd immunity lot countries followed simple message isolate sick. It’s relief read NY Times morning email summary outdoor transmission thing you’re talking someone close while. person jogging cycling past isn’t going anything. 

But says reason colleges banning outdoor activities it’ll force students hang inside. takes lockdown sceptic point zero cases originating within country stopping COVID. biggest success Moderna inexperienced small sized company really challenge large sized companies stumbling (AZ). pumped money expertise Moderna Moderna take larger pharma partner. larger partner US government. 

I think terms success alone measured smashing success. Moderna one best vaccines (although Novovax may slightly better) timeline wise time. vaccine alone account 50% vaccinations US.

When Fauci got vaccine camera took Moderna heavily involved program. damn proud deserves be. doctors think completely remake society “zero disease” selfish empathy people don’t work healthcare government.

It’s ok they’ll demand regardless people lost industries Covid aren’t gonna willing lock four months year eradicate flu, someone 300 miles away doesn’t get Covid. come uk still pissing lockdowns. Surely roadmap news god like.

I house year Thank goodness Donald Trump making possible!!! Israel tortured national testing plan monitor case rate. It’s testing symptomatic people. rate, best thing take vaccine hope best. way possibly stop future variants forming easily now. Would surprised we’ve many states due non-caring places are. I’m sure know one town city state doesn’t give fuck virus minimal thing allowing spread.

With way things going now, end like flu, right? Doesn’t flu new versions every years maybe even year sometimes gets vaccine? feel we’ll add Covid list 10 years word Covid lost sting like flu point something new comes people just, “Oh it’s Covid flu”. Perhaps time, though, doctors super easy way weed got Covid flu. countries much smaller U.S. Australia's population largely concentrated around 3 cities. countries locked everyone earlier preventing people traveling cities traveling in/out countries. people travel, quarantining mandatory officials actually checked individuals. would impossible implement U.S. 

In fact think 2 positive cases Victoria talking lock downs again. yes, people wearing masks, working home, reducing public gatherings, reduce numbers Covid regular flu. said, read CDC postings, state grouping Covid flu together numbers. argument really virus spread restaurants, schools, workplaces, construction sites, etc? home gatherings? 0% people actually follow instructions stay home stop visiting people?

It's one thing say everybody follows lockdown orders letter. another entirely lose forest trees think work cases go zero. never locked everybody would've caught covid within months health care system would've collapsed. 175K cases Wednesday would certainly rise.

Canada, everyone always says best healthcare system, small percentage vaccines distributed even per capita. sure let go vaccine shop get vaccine. I’m even allowed get one fucking september live. fully expect guidelines used justification keep schools closed.

6 feet students? enough space (especially poorer districts), we'll keep st 50%.

High quality ventilation systems recommended? School old (again, especially poorer districts), better stay closed.

I wish optimistic would result kids school. Instead, I'm afraid opposite. wish simple convince stupid Americans like Sister-in-laws MIL get vaccine. 😫.  Ugh!  crazy beliefs really driven wedge relationship. saying mask mandates testing, contact tracing, etc., plus first-world health care system people afraid go doctor. way people stay safe going work. Makes sense, agree!

Sounds great! please explain nearly every single Western country - remote sparsely populated island - that's tried make work failed. It’s like people can’t distinguish something won’t disrupt life much least voluntary (a lot people may never NEED want travel country requires yellow fever vaccine, may even know countries are. Lord knows can’t name them.) something would really upend way life. would show vaccine passport get local minor league hockey games, thought kind disturbing. Alex berenson absolute twat, lies constantly misrepresents data every vaccine related post makes. Covid reactivation/recurrence documented Totally. argument “well need record vaccination travel Angola work terminally-I’ll AIDS patients, would problem present medical history every time enter public space” fucking scary way. president office cared American lives, death toll today. hubris. write book boot.

Full protection occur time second dose even 100% protection. best advice keep masks distancing. safe reported numbers infections drop small number. Keep information high quality. lol - you’re getting uh? Yes knew toddler died flu years ago, I've scared flu years - still lived lives. completely agree worth risk kids go back fall. Hopefully society cautious going work / school sick on! Also keep mind it’s couple month time period yet could cause decrease numbers theory yeah great news early estimate. Excited see data next month two Thanks Geoffrey! Ah, would explain Macron ""admires"" then. Why? here. Wednesday!
Was super tired throughout Thursday, jab arm bit sore that's basically it! Perfectly stated! It’s shocking much concerned cost vaccines bearing risk product failure, yet impact Covid economy government finances trillions Euros. Exactly, hence bullshit hypothetical. thing hoped govt would subsidize production vaccines officially approved tens millions doses would available get go. seems like things subsidized enough accomplish large scale caches time vaccines approved

The way understood it, entire point warp speed. Manufacturers going make vaccine anyway, Pfizer example even take warp speed money. Warp speed supposed make safe manufacture doses even vaccine fails clearly plan help much that, barely million vaccines approval magically ramped super quick. 

I'm big fan warp speed totally forgot distribution. good vaccine get people's arms. Eliminating travel impossible. still essential work travel, cargo transporters, mail. Or, better phrased, possible, would lead much worse world live in. variants found even Australia border tightly shut possible due island. None outweighs 3 scandals corruption charges get ignored hypocrites would conservative similar record thrown out.

The carbon tax Fucking criminal forcing us regular people pay damage billion dollar corporations countries like China cause. carbon tax accomplishes nothing except taking money. introduced restrictions export vaccines long ago row UK AstraZeneca. Except whole world shut time Australia MUCH less COVID already circulating. US shut Australia/New Zealand stage COVID would required Trump closed borders, shut schools businesses, enacted mass quarantines December 2019. think would gone? Everyone know gotten pretty sick dose 2 prepare - lots fluids, rest, Tylenol Advil. Yeah, maybe getting huff righteous indignation, ought read what's said first.

If bothered consider context exchange, know relative outcomes different states countries. Australia poor basis comparison US reasons gave - single one made effort refute. emoted pulled ""but live card."" yet breath, start shitting US response, ignoring fact every Western done poorly US, reasons gave.

I also noted lockdowns *did* positive effect Australia, tremendous cost, outcome applicable rest Western world.

But hey, let *actually said* get way made-up strawman argument keen ranting against. That's india that's covax. India manufacturing country get fair share deal stock piling 80-90 millions doses opening exports. yet never see articles Sunday Monday posting large decreases cases. C’mon everyone knows Thursday Friday highest reported gotta get clicks death counts falling faster say Jordan, neighboring country? save Canada’s economy one world’s widest, efficient economic support program? federal plan hand out. Basically manufacturers shipped States figure individually.

The vaccines produced first place Pfizer Moderna know build factories run human trials themselves.

Honestly Warp Speed empty brand name. lucky companies states still independently mostly competent take slack.

Having cohesive federal plan would probably put us even better position however. Fauci literally said Put teachers top vaccination priority reopen schools now. Problem solved Thank response.. wanna sound ungrateful. I'm really happy got vaccine (working elderly care t).

Right fear permanently losing sense smell that's screwing up. know dying getting lung damage much worse since witnessed friend mine losing thought scares greatly. I've seeing close friends family months. change fact satisfied social life pandemic, told put self-improvement goals hold indefinitely good me. should, protocol France laughable we'll soon like UK I'm boat. working home live area that's pro-lockdown (in American sense) sat bar sporting event/concert year. fiance starting accept dining inside restaurants made anxious past fall know feel. grandmother convinced vaccine kills gives covid. convincing perfectly safe. aslong get vaccinated safe majority population get vaccinated im fairly optimistic lowers risk significantly us even vaccinated.

However, turned around soon could knew allowed want get caught.

I bet like again. continuously patrolled potential fines enough make vast majority ordinary people avoid it. Even perfect, substantially reduce movement people impact viral spread. like lockdowns, rule breakers people obey rules. could definitely see face first filmed heading back WH, took mask greet crowd.

At least doctors understanding get lot ethical training 1:1 patient interactions. wish. think miserable one little contact people. guess, probably Moderna doesn’t stored massively freezing temps like Pfizer could wrong  Right understand intent, capabilities. Hamas want get reelected right? 😘 coach would say run anything significant difficult / stressful norm. body source stress essentially counts since immune system need ramp up, don’t want body getting pulled much two directions essentially trying also recover workout. 

Also, FWIW wife best friend (one Pfizer, one Moderna) essentially reaction sore arm second shot. stick plan it’s guaranteed you’ll feel like crap :) parents days away 2 doses. in-laws got first. opening sign wife weeks. might act able get together easter. can't even tell many times I've gotten takeout walked place picked food eaten walk home. 

Now cue one guy says ""well happened yet will!"" Based available evidence, know:
- schools closed harms kids multiple ways, hits vulnerable hardest 
- schools open increased community spread infection rates among teachers students.

Yes, open. Period. 

If student high risk, virtual option. teacher high risk think vaccine sufficient protect them, perhaps teaching best career path right now.  end day, even doesn’t wipe covid face earth altogether (which really realistic target anyway), vaccine likely eventually turn disease something much lower morbidity mortality, even something like influenza still 100x improvement current situation in. Madrid. Numbers falling despite that. that’s reason 3rd wave. private meetings holidays.

The restrictions CZ way overboard. Blanket closure feasible long term.

All introverts loving lockdowns might think it’s great idea. obey, especially private gatherings. Nowadays, called asshole conforming (and somewhat rightly so), day majority people ultra fed everything waiting others make first move (e.g., take masks not) -- presume happen vaccines become widely available. Agreed, that’s headline talking about. strange. Hopefully someday science tell us why! 

I heard early hope/suspicion strain coronavirus similar enough this, good immune system, T-cells might able fight off. since colds coronaviruses, maybe that's possible? Trouble there's way know that's (LOL) might eventually explain this. There’s places gulf coast barely give away. live Louisiana refresh Walgreens appointment list times day likely find pharmacy get next 72 hours. Folks Houston driving Lake Charles get literally couldn’t fill daily appointments. don’t fill them, risk tossing doses. 

Then there’s redder counties Texas barely waitlist they’ve already vaccinated eligible residents willing get it. reality need reallocate doses regions willing take it’s much free all. stupid things? Win stupid prizes! feeling likely keeping people coming Austria since went SA there. wrong, would choose someone administer care properly trained physically care someone personally believe vaccine stop virus spreading (covid vaccine stop transmission) choosing ideology tangible safety. person covid vaccine make safer. stop people transmitting virus. believe bs I've also seen said (I think niece) ""germaphobia"" fear cooties, rather looking people sick ""weak."" fits whole personality. don’t let existence vulnerable people relegate living constant fear. live would dull meaningless. People care covid million externalities nearly everything downstream effects kill vulnerable. Life quite unfair, vulnerable people expect everyone cater fact ones selfish link posted here, chance? looked ABC Twitter page thing saw Fauci talking mask mandates able relaxed reach 70% vaccination US only? yeah, every day pandemic costing world hundreds billions. record, made [this used CDC backdated data seemed include vast majority these. used CDC data backdated better standardized local health reporting agencies reporting. Ohio's COVID deaths numbers agency reported also made sense levels all-cause mortality experiencing. ready Perfect Peggy need something new gripe about! screams bloody murder masks perfectly screeches unperfect distancing, went nuts married couple (heard secondhand) 6 feet apart times. Yh know much long term effects covid exactly common rare mean worse getting ill vaccine? course not. vaccine ever 100% effective always small level risk remains vaccines significantly lower risk need worry much. people vaccinated safer whole society since there's less cases go around less chance covid mutating lowers vaccine efficiency Marco remarkably unpopular politician. point him. Ha. true. Ah makes sense. didn’t know could that.  keep seeing really stupid memes feeds saying ""if prevent Covid-19, getting vaccinated"". why. prevents death, works.

If one vast majority near-zero risk death Covid infection, that's stupid question ask.

If vaccinated stops spread, however, *that's* clear reason low-risk person get it. 

But public health figures keep saying they've evidence does. reading opinion piece non scientist today coronavirus won’t gone summer fall still locked down, new variants need 90% immunity, new variant might still pop that’s ineffective. authors conclusion still live like tor 2021. 

I feel like people don’t want can’t sell scary op-eds more. reality taking brand new vaccine right away doesn’t suddenly make vaccinations (i.e anti-vaxx). Also “anti-vaxxers” broad definition won’t removed healthcare posistions removed general population. Cry it. lockdown perpetually forever? exactly right. can’t prove (yet) stop transmission assume might not. messaging terrible (not surprising) science always worked. variants came prior vaccines much selection pressure. can't endanger vaccine effectiveness overlap mass vaccination mass infection spread, that's really risks vaccine escape variants. devote much life caring random people internet probably bots think.

Yes, original scientific claim, ""don't know"" gets twisted ""does not"" lot people conversation. can't find single article reporting this... also seeing anything @abc @abcnews within past 24 hours. limit it. seen people say full confidence prevent transmission within last month. visiting loved ones! horror selfish people. Remember people pissed Florida decided prioritize seniors? CDC wasn’t recommending it, that’s every country it’s like Florida alone idea. everyone vaccinating seniors. 

I moved Tampa 2017 I’m rare demographic people voted Cuomo vote DeSantis. still point couple good ideas several bad ideas them. example, Cuomo shouldn’t sent covid positive residents back nursing homes DeSantis let counties institute enforce mask mandates. This, even better getting one all...they lied wrong. Definite BS, fair, see lot ""cases drop"" Sunday/Mondays especially big spikes. doses available different people vaccinated. takes six weeks first shot immunity, adds month half. also realistically going take months get people. I’ve first dose Pfizer well coworkers mine. Sore arm 3 days maybe digestive issues I’ve heard side effects. I’m sure different everyone, though. Agreed. also said breath continue take protective measures. Like...why? CDCs messaging place last 12 months. Everyone flies needs get tested - RT-PCR testing vacilities major airports thermal checks stage offboarding process- flew US saw nothing sort US airports.

Mask adherence 100% well 70-80% Mumbai.

Most India extremely warm sunny - shown drastically reduce amount time virus able survive wild.  
We've also seen research says virus death rates higher countries higher history autoimmune diseases (some relationship cytokine storms)

I would surprised factors combined (climactic, modest mask usage, partial herd immunity due spread younger population) ends reducing R0 less 1. 

During peak pandemic mumbai, death undercounting estimated [a factor 

Another factor could lack old-age homes - socially acceptable India account 40% covid deaths USA. Maybe India avoided super-killer events nursing homes. Please stop lying spread fear. I’m looking forward see people giving Trump credit vaccines.

Operation Warpspeed may become Trump’s *Autobahn*. friend Adelaide certainly willing put lockdowns travel restrictions, also smug largely Covid-free. fairly common human bias. People unable handle uncertainty decent amount uncertainty choose option protects (if assume something risky better reverse).  

I can't count amount times people askes ""is xx safe"" things either safe risky spectrum. really hope people pay attention article. one biggest sticking points this. I'm going wear mask I'm hiking, usually alone less popular trails, I'm sustained close contact others. look forward day seen selfish quite vocal individuals. DC schools reopened going virtual Tuesday educators getting second dose Monday they're prepping case side effects.

Also childcare private/charter schools became eligible couple weeks ago.

In meantime theres mandatory masks (including covering nose) distancing measures, shared supplies (everyone buckets), hvac systems modified replaced necessary.

Kids taught frequently wash hands.

They're also providing virtual learning, people go route.

They're really well handling this, props. even everyone Australia vaccinated covid would still circulate small numbers kill small number people. doesn’t seem like government willing accept even case, end? worked malaria lmao  😂 poor kids holy shit said something along lines ""for rest year"" speech NIH. is... rather different ""mask 100 days"" line he's hammering past months.

Excellent media-ing good news doom gloom. You’re hired. Apparently pulling boot straps doesnt apply land lords. emergency fund, plan. Thank Germany it. BioNtek developed vaccine. Pfizer. America selfishly keeping allies vaccinating vulnerable population. Warp speed also funded moderna’s clinical trials vaccine. Without warp speed moderna’s vaccine would likely still undergoing clinical trials would likely Pfizer vaccine approved right now. without warp speed we’d probably half supply right now. Part weird since like airborne plague, known articles kept talking dangers people would take stance online die seeing someone across street.

Part frustration seeing media finally recognise still see people talking they've outside maybe twice past year they're taking seriously. Obviously effect worry go outside walk least.

I think saw someone Los Angeles daily discussion post say criticised mask car windows case virus flies hits another person. people know perfectly ready live normally.

However, know people going really really struggle interact socially again. definitely need therapy. Social distancing really messed lot people up, mentally speaking.

One colleagues thinks future ""personal HEPA filtered air"" plans wear one space helmet things even everyone vaccinated. Now, talk cheap course. We'll see happens get there. honestly sign really bad health OCD. Many people going struggling moving forward. majority course, surprised everyone among privileged work home class knew someone state. less common among communities people used risk lives. *certain* first stimulus checks went out, secured win.

But proceeded screw every step way November, American people finally decided enough enough. Billy Gates knows milk!! good. supplies Britain 👍cheers lads number people refusing vaccinate

Getting COVID would serious getting yearly cold. Maybe even less.  That’s Pfizer develop vaccine, BioNtek did. Germany paid this. Every life saved BioNtek/Pfizer vaccine thanks Germany paying 80% vaccine without asking anything return. we'd herd immunity. 30 maybe 50% people exposed far. every place this. order get vaccinated flu last fall, break 'do enter building that's home' pandemic rule get vaccinated. super nervous entire time. Crazy got vaccine first Maybe hard believe US government UK pretty damn poorly terms reducing deaths/cases.

UK huge first peak, got cases really low totally squandered advantage opening much willing enter shorter lockdowns cases started going again. led insanely deadly second wave even worse first.

The US actually ok initially never really got cases summer bunch deaths late summer/early autumn countries managed suppress virus.

Corrupt, easily bought out, ignorant, incompetent. answer OPs question. endgame Australia? little natural immunity one big slip could result massive outbreak.

They racing vaccinate population aren't. lockdowns another full year insane path end available using it. practical 100% efficacy severe cases way way mark, facts. doubt even 100k fully vaccinated exposed since, puts severe cases somewhat high number compared several demographics without vaccination. Damn, attributing vaccine rollout Biden administration alarming that's prevailing sentiment Americans good news lot people. definitely describe american penal system ""excessive coddling"" lmao vaccine using developed Germany paid 80% German taxes, anything Trump?

The USA allowing exports, that’s reason well. Taking fair share. getting 10% from? That's impression ive gotten, like flu... always mutating, always going around ...from company makes them, like everyone else is? compared control group unvaccinated people. could even infer many infections happened prior vaccination, vaccine provided protection active infection. Overall country might well, mean every single county state well getting people vaccinated. person could live place going lot slower, might continue slow next months. still multi-vaccine studies, past vaccines indication immune system easily handle getting fact benefit ""booster shot"". Maybe, comment French arrogance. Many common preconditions opening schools — including vaccines teachers students, low rates infection community — necessary safely teach children person, consensus pediatric infectious disease experts said new Instead, **the 175 experts** — mostly pediatricians focused public health — **largely agreed safe enough schools open elementary students full-time in-person instruction now. said true even communities Covid-19 infections widespread, long basic safety measures taken.** important, said, universal masking, physical distancing, adequate ventilation avoidance large group activities. Yea already reports eu locked extra month minimum compared usa  Cool, start vaccinating Palestinians. success rate good Palestinians? Agreed, it’s messaging marketing. way communicated Im sure dismayed possibly
Discouraged people getting vaccine. I’m sure folks thinking what’s point ultimate goal get everyone vaccinated asap. We've hit supply bumps help. Even though supply lines look like let flood gates open missed weeks getting needles arms serious rate. vaccines better less vaccines.

If J&amp;J, Novavax, etc get approved even helps much more. mom 68, eats fast food 10 times week, diabetes health issues, overweight 100 pounds got Covid. symptom slightly scratchy throat headache 3 days. everyone high risk bad outcomes. need ""go away"" get back normal. Science = spreading fear (?) elected officials? Oh yes. assholes oppose masks measures contain god damn virus. ones made stupid bet ""just like flu"". guess what, assholes, mutated multiple times one variant possibility saying fuck vaccines now. Keep making excuses sociopaths [Fauci also said expects mask mandates relaxed public get point vaccination spread greatly reduced. Yh booster shots winter pretty inevitable point. Naive think still provides 95% efficiency vaccines saw notable drop new variant. looks like still offers protection better nothing delay return normality. Starting look like may like flu get annual flu vaccine. lol, European officials held responsible anything. Dreaming big here. literally google read stories children dealing heart lung issues contracting COVID. sent article discusses reasons careful kids that’s bueno guess. You’re troll that’s ok. Im opposite, might get vaccinated make mandatory. It’s scary forcing people get vaccines especially something completely new. smug ""thoughtful intelligent"" public radio speaking cadence

ugh I’ve also heard this... I’ll find guess. Mine’s scheduled 25th. thankful I’m able get it. Honestly really care much mask, nuisance personally think dumb ineffective what.

What care public gatherings allowed again, bars, restaurants, concerts, sporting events, kids events, etc. vaccinated see reason wear mask definition ""normal"".  Pot calling kettle black. Login wall another corrupt asian country Yes, vaccinate Palestinians Occupied territory well. like reversed order events 75 years ago Excessive coddling people fear committing crimes, pansy Could provide source that? believe I’m interested reading more. would make make lot sense considering much hospitalizations dropped. Yeah saying mean right lmao. Stop posting emotions post brain perhaps? Nah, much likely go Kariko Weissman, researchers University Pennsylvania lay foundation vaccines. BioNTech, Moderna, Curevac built Penn technology; companies even paying royalties university vaccines. Team goody two shoes lose mask burning takes right?! Wut, that's insane. want get flu, I'm going get shot. Even though I'm near zero risk dying flu sucks want shot every year... okay let's take side argument actually know several factors.

The data .1% severe cases. likely 10% participants actually exposed virus, like 1% severe cases. Among demographics, that's high higher amount severe cases get without vaccination. 

That's actually little concerning. getting confused, multiple vaccines, effective certain circumstances others. take time people die, also takes time record paperwork deaths get show data. BioNtek Vaccine. Pfizer manufacturer. Keep appointment friend. remember people would kill get appointment right also, missed appointment results shot tossed trash? opposite taking vaccines, that's thing America right they're likely done well countries dropped bag. Japan, Australia, Europe, etc way behind comes vaccine distribution compared US, UK, Israel. mention US government pretty much bankrolled successful vaccine candidates billions taxpayer money. pretty likely Americans travelling year Pacific still heavily restricted. Jeez. “All available evidence” probably include CDC guidelines. “all available evidence” conducted based opening schools precautions place. quality studies support opening schools precautions possible. idea absurd. 

You can’t ignore basic safety FEEL schools open. I’m teacher, school taught number one, first, biggest responsibility provide safe environment. ignoring cdc guidelines that? transmission thing you’re talking someone close while. person jogging cycling past isn’t going anything.

Only now? That's common sense since beginning. ""beach shaming"" articles brought lot clicks... No, thank you. Nicely put. Exactly. smugness unbearable times. Calling Americans ""plague rats"" attacking cars US plates come US cap hand asking vaccines. They're basically raised look Americans find national pride ""not American"". Self proclaimed ""friendly neighbor North"", ""friends"" like needs enemies. Yeah, I’ve following Bloomberg hospitalization tracker religiously lol, added confusion. yeah makes sense takes multiple weeks death occur *""with right *""as long measures *""whenever *""if people really *""provided community spread low""*

So it? can't ways. Nope. I'm saying that, bit patience let vaccination program gather steam, get back normal faster avoid another wave infections. cake eat too, we're patient.

And mean 2022, mean spring summer months vaccinations become widely available. That’s real though. worldwide? Still though, hell fucking yeah vaccines winning still around. Swine Flu Spanish Flu H1N1 influenza strain. Unironically yes Translation: Confirmed deliveries nearly doubled approved vaccines. Great news EU Norway gets ~1% EU total. know misinformation persists. did.

The CDC tons guidance website covered every little detail, feds required stats submit - sign-off - comprehensive plans.

It's really feds' fault hospitals execute. feds' fault that, large, healthcare workers took weekends holidays Covid ran country like wildfire.

This failure execution individual healthcare org level (and failure states quickly recognize lack motivation compel hospitals better), failure federal government. possible according research article posted previously. (Can't immediately find link.) Possible sense research needed rule out, sense likely. I’m going say completely new technology kid 99% chance surviving sniffles. I’d cautious actual flu Covid child. Thank you!

It sure is... plus side, got spend whole first trimester wearing potato sack feeling horrible comfort home husband verrrry understanding. Cannot imagine functioning adult that. Annnnd single person touched belly midwife husband. awful lot dead Americans probably wouldn’t minded Australian plan now, given choice USA 100% use vaccine something repair international image. 100% expected grateful that.

Yeah, probably 25+% medical professionals local hospital wore masks anyway pandemic. literally turn around sending kids school. first everyone saying kids spread germs easily, would even think otherwise?

Now teacher unions difficult apparently.

Honestly, think everything entirely organic. get political numbers outlook changing drastically day Biden inaugurated made raise eyebrows. Theres second hand contact third/forth hand etc. plane bringing people around world would spread around world everyone goes different ways. dont want feel forced vaccination would like free will.

That's maximum potential high end everyone caught Covid could catch Covid using CFR time. Uhh seen US medical system? Thank thank reassurance. &lt;3 

Seeing freaked little JFC New Yorkers enough, can't imagine another intense lockdown exactly one year nightmare April 2020. agree though vaccines getting masses soon, there's lot feel positive not! :) free side affects vaccine, restricted normal life. Enjoy jab smart people people built different. can’t imagine surviving much have. want thank daily thread keeping sane.

I suicidal ideation early last month. month later, I've become cheerleader many others. Sometimes get tired doubt positivity, guys keep going.

I know ways go things turn, thank keeping head perspective. Never thought I'd saying sub places, pretty great! That's really true, though? Care kids age still open much 2020. live New York, daycares never closed. anything, overenrolled due fact start taking school aged children September. voted return normal Biden, new normal crap. hope delivers, it’s lined him. 


I grateful live US amazing states rights fractured government, state local politicians tons control, especially lockdowns. bell end... Tuberculosis HIV endemic, least Europe.  Every boomer know extremely anti-lockdown horrified younger generation: children grandchildren. Anecdotal, I'm aware. millennial everyone know age group - healthy people - terrified want lockdown last eradication... endemic virus... Agreed. Also, hate reddit buddy. Fuck everyone platform (yeah included). That's good news. means confident vaccine sufficient efficacy despite low dosage.

P3 readout scheduled end March. allow approval early April first batch vaccine end April. understand this. Walmart? Fair enough. plus side there’s data studies efficacy 14 days first dose. think full efficacy reached 14 days second dose give take depending version. doesn’t mean drop guard early it, lost causes coverage better none. 

Even “fully” opening hope mask mandates indoor venues remain place least near future. think it’ll fair open businesses fully mid-late spring precautions. still hope it’s see packed sporting events concert venues. Yeah really hope evidence far point continued existence. 

Mutation changes transmissibility susceptibility vaccine. Asymptomatic spread. Global reach. Etc. 

I hope I’m wrong though! dad finally signing get vaccine. peeves many friends - twenties thirties - got get his. Yes. open schools! dangerous narrative. Nursing homes staff properly care isolated covid positive patients. That’s hid deaths death rate high. Ideally, you’d want hospitals. 

The hospitals NYC *never* hit full capacity. rock hard place situation. preparation triage something never happened. 

The place send nursing home patients *not* back nursing homes could infect patients. medical body suggested course action. None. Cuomo made decision actual medical professionals recommending cost lives. He’s investigated it. POSERS DIE, BOB ""people watched dad die"" weirdly specific speaking someone personally know. &amp; followed ""other people know"", implying knew previous person well. bad, sent editor posting.

anyway, understand context, im talking people literally know watched dad die &amp; came back work, mask, distance, vaccine, &amp; planning vacations, change anything original snarky bs?

travel bad long time. everyone knows that. claim that? Where? 

And actually yes much ones control. boomers generation destroyed market raised cost living impossible standards. complain millennials lack “worth ethic” despite fact educated generation America’s yet live. Boomers generation including GenX entitled generation people ever exist world. Mine going flames lmao absolutely makes antivax.  I’m youngish, I’m healthy. I’m already low risk severe covid. Know low efficacy vaccine gets me? Mild covid. Know I’m already naturally risk for? Mild covid. 

JJ 85% effective severe covid. Know Moderna is? 100%.

Why risk long-term lingering covid problems vaccine maker came short? don’t want “mild covid.” Period. 

I’d say I’m good company. doctors know difference. both. one woman used work small town keeps commenting vaccine posts “other people shot” like she’s service everyone. Doesn’t believe masks, got banned Facebook week, routinely shuts conversation anything related “crazy liberal science” people like this? Less 150k dead palastians ~100 years coflict. suck knowing stuff relevant discussion Oh Absolutely. Definitely problem.

Once there’s pediatric approval fir vaccine required vaccination school along others.

I fully support right businesses discriminate based vaccination status hope travel providers so. healthcare provider collecting data actually research arm believe responsible this. Also government pretty clearly laid counts doesn’t. reason careful data ability gather data safety efficacy vaccine part got us vaccine earlier. data sent Pfizer weekly basis. Everyone different, doses, feel anything till like 4-5 hours afterward (and arm pain + fatigue) hear you. close calls must scary.

I think sides selective vision, preferring positive negative news psychological emotional needs anything.

The problem reality messy complicated, entirely good bad news.

We need able see reality *is*, *want be*.

I'm sorry going this. I've struggling depression myself, grandmother ICU likely see dies. Hang there. important part fact unnecessary preventable deaths *at all.* 
The fact action could reduced deaths degree makes lies inaction reprehensible. *Any* unnecessary deaths awful, far tell socio/psychopaths seem feel differently this. :( Meanwhile many dead. This. Thanks info. mean wouldn’t matter, since CureVac doesn’t even Phase 3 results yet.

By late October Novavax 5500 people enrolled trial, results late January among huge surge cases. CureVac began late December there’s update enrolment, likely won’t results April anyways. Regulators can’t approve without info. Easy there. Tongue cheek sarcasm detected post. Also government flat say normal return soon vaccinated?! It’s getting quite scary even US isn’t happening areas. also nervous precedent sent closure schools businesses, it’s frightening. I'm nostalgic 90's rivalry Mets Braves. fun time kid! Israelis treat Palestinians like garbage. would help them. anything would give intentionally spoiled doses. didn’t. Wtf? really know nothing article 3? read “right life” assume means government intervene whenever intent prevent death? Article 3 nothing seem think, extension article 5 related freedom detention torture, etc. resulted response happened concentration camps 

There world interpret article 3 mean seem think means posted last daily thread pretty late, I'm posting again

Legitimate question, what's end goal Australia? started vaccinating, go strict lockdown week even cases region. keep lockdowns next year more? sounds insane. I'd rather US honestly completely false. heard herd immunity works? called ""buying"" , - bought them. Radical ha?  Well, least going war might noble (sans Vietnam War, rightly prompted massive movement). sacrifices noble, sitting home reason build resentment wise brave. suggest do? Netflix chill? makes **no** sense. Remember predicted everything going overflow like crazy last year? Glad never happened. They've wrong lot before. wish said inputs use predictions, seems like ""garbage in, garbage out"" problem.

I worry :) I'm huge worrier! Shots going arms cases naturally going anyway. there's lot positive about! many then? Must least 1 million day, least several million Palestinians total since start Israeli-Palestinian conflict, like educated friend u/fbuell145 mentioned. stop speaking know I'm surrounded idiots &amp; life depends knowing they're wrong?

Advocates final destruction maintain longer ***any valid rationale retaining samples, pose hazard escaping laboratories, opponents destruction maintain samples may still value scientific research, especially since variants smallpox virus may still exist natural world thus present possibility disease re-emerging future and/or used a*** I'm sure data reliable. showing ignorance Israeli healthcare system. bound different collected people slightly different motivations. clinical trial set goals different healthcare provider, might say strict case not. counting sick people presenting data world governments approval. probably lot gleaned picking details point. want timelines lets start \[this NPR right top ""On Feb. 29, U.S. surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams masks offer benefit average citizen.""

So start timeline masks US. clear knew masks effective February preventing spread doctors, April 3rd CDC would start telling us put shirts face.

By comparison article "" Meanwhile, health agencies taken stand calls mask-wearing public early stages outbreak — Hong Kong [Jan. mainland China [Jan. 31](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s7916/202001/a3a261dabfcf4c3fa365d4eb07ddab34.shtml). ""  else happened January 31st.......

Going forward 9 days tweet \[this CNN Interview Fauci telling public wear masks unless sick specifically talking shortages\] interview given right New York infecting self, Deaths would start spiking around March 27ish Peaking April 14th. lets factor mean time death infection 18 days? gave interview telling people mask's help unless sick days New York started rampant uncontrolled spread. already month Source outbreak, China ordered masks general public timeline proven asymptomatic spread multiple countries following.

So lets go deeper \[Here wired article Feb nearly month tweet Dr. Adams telling people capitals letters buy masks. grab quote though prove point. "" China Global Television Network, factories churning 20 million masks day "" China knew masks worked went drive production them.

I wonder happening US time. \[March \[March  \[March lets pretend know April masks helped. Even Trump never invoked defense act force production N95s, properly invoked Ventilators.  \[Here article September still talking mask mean random companies January wanted produce sell US masks said no? would random companies January February expecting increase mask use? Could source outbreak already knew wear masks telling people so?

This also ignoring fact interviewI already linked July "" ""I regret anything said context time said it, correct. told task force  meetings serious problem lack PPEs masks health providers putting harm's way every day take care sick people,"" [Fauci told ""

""we knew masks worked march 8th told public wear masks unless sick everything could prevent general public knowing nothing prepare this"" statement says factor timeline everything else.

Am wrong?

I also apparently follow hyperlink directions? tried 3 different ways. plenty, plenty won’t invalid reasons. agreement Oslo accords israel PLO israel responsible healthcare. Read here: mad bro? vaccinated people still able transmit virus anyway? triggered word Israel lil buddy? Seriously, feel safe teaching getting vaccine wearing high quality mask, enough? masks work? vaccines effective? yes, what's issue?

If believe true, still want teach, making excusing point. you’re claiming generation fixed problems time you’re “boomer” aged? Sure.

The things you’re complaining beyond direct control. Everybody think best theirs. You’ll same. “boomers” got lucky. excerpt:

 data suggest current vaccines could retain ability prevent hospitalizations deaths, even face decreased overall efficacy due antigenic variation. unclear whether changes vaccine composition needed effectively control COVID-19 pandemic; however, prudent prepared. companies indicated plans manufacture test vaccines based emerging variants, studies provide important information potential broaden immune response.  Pfizer vacc good two years know causes infertility? Dying covid. There’s zero evidence vaccine causes infertility. target specific proteins virus nothing fertility. American. yes actually attributed Germany. Since that’s paid BioNtek vaccine (wrongly called Pfizer vaccine) lol yes I'm teacher Seoul online-only last months. fully opened entire school year. think fully open first semester new school year either (Kor school calendar goes March-Feb).

Personally, hybrid system great. measures taken within school students also great. Plus students amazingly cooperative.

A full re-opening would impossible considering dense Seoul importantly many multi-generational households are. would put huge chunk seniors risk.

I'm skeptical full re-opening US can't even data says yes, would proceed. would proceed cautiously. Part reason US disaster reckless overconfidence.  did. Yeah, lot people kind forgetting normal society really great lot ways, kept lot weaknesses swept rug. probably headed hard times future without pandemic, wakeup call start trying fix problems exposed. Instead people basically acted like see something wrong problem, want fight tooth nail hide everything away again. sounds rough, glad worst it. Pfizer vaxx? country can't even manage vaccinate old fast. friend parents 92 years old got appointment April. rate even vaccinated adults vaccines authorized children. nothing kids, lowest risk dying severe symptoms. 1) others get tested give (I assume care that!).

2) vaccines really good, they're 100% effective.

3) One thing I've wondering vaccine protection relates **intensity exposure**. instance, 95% effective averaged clinical trial participants, number lower ""intense"" exposure (like spending weekend indoors together) relative passing stranger street? aware data question directly (it sounds like human challenge trial seem decided vaccines time around).

**If someone better info last point please chime in!** People wary ethics followed.

They literally cannot, cause english work we

We, people living countries happen care future country followed Russia's method Sputnik V accidentally launched vaccine severe side-effects?

Are insane? happened company tested vaccine russia russians. live russia!

But actually happened actually benefit anyone, get vaccine arm earlier, really moot even talk it. No, measles. mother pass along natural immunities nursing. USA stops preventing others filling orders starts vaccination least vulnerable. America first eh? TLDR: vaccine distribution shit show, better give whoever can, soon can. 

As much we'd like to, can't completely optimize gets first. Let's remember president vaccines first distributed - support federal government, leaving states figure own, half state governments spending energy denying issue rather making plans distribute vaccine. Health departments across country legitimately surprised receive vaccines rush communication available. great priority elderly good technology aware what's happening, vaccine hard/impossible store long term. advice every expert get soon can, regardless risk. Otherwise doses might go waste someone thinks high enough risk, whereas higher risk people aware get it. Great, let's talk Israel preventing Palestinians vaccinated. going Covid cases. Died accident, tested positive? way sir. Leave then. statement contradictory news never mentioned?

Do mean that:

Article body: ""One town forced teacher remove PPE""

Should actually be

Article body: ""One town forced teacher remove PPE ***and another allow librarians use masks***"" Right. Moderna say it’s still effective? yet context used fairly unambiguous: consider idea Israel killed millions Palestinians plausible enough ask evidence — indication extreme ignorance. Pfizer, there’s evidence showing reach 90% efficacy 3 weeks **first** dose, ie, day zero second dose. trying spread fear, guys get reason.  mean get far without godlike immune system

she's tortoise territory Around me, businesses gone mostly back full hours. you? might. used cautious flying (I’d fly basically every day) would constantly hand sanitizer, started wiping seat Clorox January. totally see wearing mask flights going forward. sick sucks, COVID worse flu/colds, etc, still want healthy. Avoiding getting sick 300 heathens germbag babies planes important wearing KN95 hours.  Palestinian data  Except Florida faring better California, didn’t. Heck, even Sweden better France, Italy, Spain U.K., Belgium pretty much “threw country open”. 

It’s year. It’s obvious numbers. say true, Florida would epicenter virus California, Sweden would country death decay, France Italy would abolished virus. I've always wondered, fines across different countries within EU easily enforced?

Moderna says 6.4 told decrease neutralizing titers 84% decrease puts levels less lowest convalescent patient 3 months. Pretty sure we've before. hope stupid question but.
Do Israeli government offer Palestinians vaccination? Amazing, thanks! True. Time tell saw earlier hope helps!! CDC FDA 1,170 reports fatalities among individuals U.S. received Covid vaccine — 0.003% vaccinated people — Dec. 14, Feb. 7. time, 41 million doses Covid-19 vaccines administered across country, according CDC. 

From CDC report above, ""a review available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, medical records findings revealed link vaccination. ""

Great! [All fully approved vaccines tiny EUA vaccines, can't find anything. kind message supposed foster confidence? Oslo Accords assign health care responsibility Palestinian Authority.

The end. limited.

CureVac alone produce EU 200 mln doses year, i.e. Moderna.

According schedule **80 mln** Q1&amp;Q2. means 8% EU population. And, condition, BioNTech delivers promised EU may kind herd immunity summer.

Logistic simpler CureVac too. curiosity, one person vaccine rest not, one person still protected? would others need tested? charged appropriately? No...if fake drug taken min. 10 yrs. hard time, death drug, life. Man wanna get vaccinated stop giving Israel money focus people IMO. It’s crazy trump said stuff like “America first!” never even considered giving money Israel. makes honestly believe Mossad plot blackmail politicians world unquestioningly support Israel. feelings anyway article says data regards people received doses. Either way, 93% effectiveness something celebrate ""jab"" ""finna"" vaccine lingo want go ballgame, concert, show, trip - it'll you.

As Floridian, statements like confusing read i'm like.....what's even stopping going sporting event concert right lol Wow, news again! watched news them, apparently Manitoba ordered 2 million doses Providence spec.

Providence apparently going start earlier production thanks investment based possibility vaccine candidate eventually approved.

Not sure correct technical perspective segment was, implied vaccine candidate largely similar Pfizer Moderna's. mRNA based. beg question, simply license approved vaccine produce distribute rather wait months eventually, maybe, release doses vaccine might, possibly approved? younger 60, safe whole time. worry lot people see it. someone please explain tf businesses still limiting hours? seems counterproductive forces people visit within shorter timeframe. honestly think used pandemic excuse cut employee hours. Masks, curfews restrictions exist many dense areas Florida.

They took balanced approach Covid currently 25th nation deaths, far better many hard lockdown states.

The people told Covid Thunderdome lied you.

They agenda. wish could! live it’s probably going May normal people. I’m super glad high risk dad already got vaccine. Israel responsible Palestinians refuses vaccine either way Cool! ask flair mods, pretty easy.

There's tons perspectives could use expertise pandemic. Microbiology immunology one facet. :-) People wary ethics followed. setting wrong precent future would **WE** care that?!

Who we, care future country followed Russia's method Sputnik V accidentally launched vaccine severe side-effects? That's callous, among things. care. Meanwhile US people distrust vaccines stupud Say me:
Mitigation 👏 👏 👏 worthwhile 👏 effort 👏 Hope son ends well, sad hits critical time many kids yeah part PhD trained human rights ethics, also relevant topics policymaking ""flattening curve"" one thing, ""mask 100 days"" Biden talking point clearly disingenuous start, everyone knew would told wear masks much longer  course. Hence point work long term places like Georgia (with porous borders) follow suit well.

The whole country suffers lowest common denominator. think hit nail head right there. explanation beyond plausible well realm likely many mouthbreathers. That's fine. never plan entering grocery store, restaurant, etc. year need mask. Basing decisions around people tell do...... hmmmmm okay answer question. March 2020 many times life worn mask? Let’s say spouse child example cold. Would popped mask go store? started wearing mask told wear one. like everyone else did. People Asia wearing masks decades. you?

I don’t remember issue masks protect ever doubt. Obviously protect people. sure think valid point. 

The common cold Flu also shown high rates asymptomatic infections. certainly deadly COVID still kill people. mind, feel guilt wearing mask times past probably responsible deaths. Also wearing mask protect people. plan wearing one public rest life?

I mean less disgusting cause death person flu 2 years cause death one COVID 2 months? restrictions gotta go get covid vaccine easy flu shot

no point Yeah weird article presupposes every single school building person involved flawless safe measures. happening. Trump let us hard?

Lockdowns, masks, restrictions, etc. determined state level, PEOPLE ultimately decide happens. case numbers hit rock bottom (as will), death numbers hit rock bottom (as will), vaccines sitting shelf everyone wants one gotten one, restrictions disappear. may continue mask choice, fine, want go ballgame, concert, show, trip - it'll you.

And FYI - we'll point end spring.  support closed borders? plan without wall? single country controls entire continent.. control everything coming wants world's largest military. wanted, is. shame offer vaccinations Palestinians. spread misinformation. since superceded Geneva convention says Israel's direct duty vaccinate Palestinians occupied areas. person knows still referring irrelevant agreement harms Palestinian people Agreed lol Strange give Pfizer Astra Zaneca. 

Edit: read article I'll quote something interesting
 
The United Nations (UN) human rights body released statement saying Israel's responsibility provide equitable access Covid-19 vaccines Palestinians Gaza West Bank.

The body says differential access ""morally legally"" unacceptable international law laid Geneva Conventions regulation occupied territories.

But Israeli health minister, Yuli Edelstein, told BBC: ""We also look so-called Oslo agreements says loud clear Palestinians take care health.""

Edit 2: Sorry link pasted below, I'm bad reddit phones  Israel offered Palestine refused.

What want? heard Europe UK, absolutely heard US. fact pushes US fairly recently loosen restrictions, turns out.

I feel bad European friends colleagues, things getting insane especially UK. Sorry. advise us keep fever reducers around well but, since symptom mine, omitted list. still managed make work week (except today. unrelated. live Texas vehicle turned car-cicle. People Texas know drive sunny weather, let alone ice. worth it). push yourself, remember typically passes couple days. think 4th day worst me. closest going home experienced. still made through. Take easy next day relax. Take care let body thing heal. It'll know it. Less custodial sentences petty crimes. perspective, haven't. goal get ad revenue clicks. Fear sells, they're jobs well. really easy compare vaccine efficacy, least headline numbers. mean go dissect linked study, general statement. first Pfizer Moderna look promising 3-4 weeks. issue people comparing headline numbers three vaccines without realizing different phase three trials structured reported. I'd absolutely take J&amp;J jab available today, although covid like 6 weeks ago I'm fine waiting line younger person. Exactly. ""Beating"" coronavirus way Austrlaia kind pyrrhic victory. ""We go back normal now"" say, except moment's notice everything stopped.

Also, give example restrictions long lasted:

[On August residents allowed travel 5km home non-essential purposes. restrction [lifted October (12 weeks). vitamin deficiency (and supplements) make   Yeah argument makes sense me. mean actually pregnant, could see holding off, that's bigger risk. otherwise? Get vaccinated. Well palestinians wish could health response much better significantly lower lever infection. People listened government said need socially distance wear masks stay home wash hands often sign restaurants QR code help contact tracing self isolate get tested. spread lower government implemented sensible plan, made sure everybody knew people it.

If people willing measure become effective. spread quite easily government made competent plan people went along it. still need wear masks social distance years come right?? messaging got really down. want back normal. read title thread? AZ tested approved 12 week gap real change there. others gambled gap extended 6 12 weeks. wife said ""Fauci ouchie"" think cute funny!

The issue could coopted antivaxxers pretty easily. think much smaller impact fact soon one feel ill, people isolate. 

In best worlds, everyone would isolate symptomatic, case 100% infections would people without symptoms.  wearing outdoors jogging outside chillin

I'm pretty sure even now. Also plenty people relatively young war? people heard Iraq Afghanistan? guess draft still great idea! mortal enemy, people want wipe face earth, inject ‘vaccine’. Ask PA vaccine every year type thing? think get special treatment, no. taking zinc Vitamin since beginning still contracted virus  Arabs get free vaccines, like Israelis Yeah would program need. matter lot start getting doses delivered. rural CA county gotten additional doses weeks least. medical community sub standard, common rural areas. local ""hospital"" lowest rating HealthGrades assign, non-critical comments facebook page *from employees hospital*. literally pay people get positive reviews. Back vaccine got FDA approval shipped, wondering badly county would bungle handling this; know. 

The largest group clinics told waiting list, writing people's names spiral notebook, bother calling back got vaccinated meantime, easier call everyone list instead. Since names kind order all, written people call in. WTF... Yeah, dad probably vulnerable person know. stays home sees 1 vulnerable friend. tells careful live im 30. I’m citing Florida government pinnacle ethics integrity. simply pointing California epicenter Florida. Texas. Lmao dumbass Good luck Learning think solely purciew humanities. good public education, I'd say level thinking really taught college. Math classes take burden logical thinking. 

And I'd say medical people believe things like that, medical education failed them, humanities. take pass microbiology immunology classes.  drinking Scotch eating nothing hot dogs year, and, same. vaccine use? want know ask doc for. PA said want israeli help. That's I'm going off. edited titles. No, meant can’t work home. Sorry came way.  us real life jobs can’t sit bedroom day. pity people. 

Desk jobs real? seem trying take high ground here. truth shit sucks everyone. cotagious, less deadly, virus get Makes behavior rhetoric virus reprehensible. getting better every week. need education eat properly Um yeah wouldn’t want follow vaccine available anyone wants it. Which, consider know vaccine supply now, going way way December. keep forcing people wear masks everywhere summer, vaccines widely available US, pretty sure would make dipshit Indiana WAY cases deaths even report today form far back Nov.2020...just saying saw AMA yesterday op answering questions vaccine legislation/administration. anyone link post?
Thanks! litterly refused offer. palastinians decided get vaccines Russia. Thats also pretty dumb thing say considering litterly every country purposefully vaccinating palastinians anything israel offered palastinians crisis, stop propaganda. utilitarian vaccinate citizens? Palestine responsible healthcare. refused help Israel. Got em lmao like amount head injuries increased helmets issued ww1 keep hearing they're ""all over"" like said. Yet whenever ask example one them... crickets.

Seems like they're kind like Big Foot there's people swear exist never actually provide evidence. Autocorrect... fixed it. already sent source said no. bridge at? I’ll meet there.  I'm actually fine now! negative thoughts product negative media social isolation. Social isolation helluva drug, let tell you.

I ton trouble securing therapist last year, finally managed get one! second appointment next week. still feel weird cause really trauma anything special, figured time least try out. way vent professional instead feeling like I'm dragging loved ones. Palestinians separate healthcare system, they've purchased Russian vaccine Russia delayed delivery. think vaccine every caused infertility. Yeah US they're basically China India. they're done studies often stay US, go Europe, go Asia job. I've never seen anyone go Canada. got mine yesterday I'm achy feverish worried would ruin weekend. Thanks confirming might. damage fetus fever cold flu well. Many diseases conditions cause issues fertility pregnancy. don’t vaccines cause infertility. know science behind vaccine there’s nothing would indicate would cause infertility. wouldn’t cite Florida, state gov extremely shady entire time. It’s arguably corrupt reported things. mention even state completely open, doesn’t mean people state traveling tourism like pandemic. It’s really normal. unlike predecessor doesn’t tend make official policy via tweets off-hand comments. People need calm sure good news me. I’d rather learn live best vaccine treatment practices continue measures past summer. That’s lie. Palestinians refused help Israel Yeah Austria prevalence may 10 percent Germany. asking me: private living room, group five vaccinated, could step notch feel comfortable? Well, course could.""
""But grocery store around people chance vaccinated yet, keep mask solidarity risk reduction around you? Yes."" 

They saying vaccinated people gather safely. advising continue wear masks cautious public around people received vaccine yet otherwise risk. seems like common courtesy. 

So correct analogy, give shit vaccinated buddies want take car track go nuts. like asking someone brand new car safety features drive like jackass congested freeway someone might driving '89 Corolla accident might hurt could serious them. I'm glad better case did. I'll try remember add update second round know goes. decrease less people transmit virus, eventually eradicating it? need work order survive doesnt mean ""accept risk"" assholes like I'm glad adverse effects. said, that's experience, way hoping fear monger people, that's sure, others stories symptoms definitely helps drive home. appreciate sharing that.

There much correlation lockdowns declining cases, vice versa, many led believe. Opps timing fine. really isn’t anyone comparable faster Thanks Dr Obvious. South Africa previously purchased covid vaccines covax. Given sloppy news reporting been, it’s perfectly possible doses previously secured, Pfizer trying screw Europe every chance gets. 

Also, order, South Africa paying twice much Europe (2.5 times), despite significantly less financial position Europe. Europe’s obsessive focus cost vs value, meant nations willing put money risk, jumped queue (see Israel, UK, US, etc..). It’s always countries trying screw you.

EAT SHIT COVID I'm wondering vaccines work way too. Like get vaccinated immunity however long, lengthened going periodically exposing it? mean, people die covid also healthy begin Yup. It’s apparently fairly common viral infections. whole point study long term study issues. 

I haven’t seen updated publication follow ups researchers stated media blown findings proportion. really teacher? Plausible mean believe though. Still need evidence that. Probably stay less locked 2022 earliest. travel, course. get confirmation bias though? He's kinda correct. South Africa gave Astrazeneca roll showed less 10% efficacy. However trial quite small involved healthy young adults clue actually helps severe symptoms not, know stop mild cases all. Nevertheless SA government stopped rollout trying sell / trade stockpile get one vaccines shows promising results OMG, glad said this! I've never heard shot described jab life month ago. Now, hear many people calling jab. world!

I agree wish monthly.

Edit- state governments broke right now. That's I'm willing go millions, lowest offer. I'm glad agree plausible evidence needed number. dont see *couldnt* slow it. ability spread limited virus ability replicate inyour body. little virus survive long enough get sneezed out, ability spread much reduced. 

Can still get someone sick? Probably. kill someone it? likely. So... arguments based things personally aware of, “intuition,” fact kids disgusting personal lives go ahead mix even larger groups together enclosed spaces we’ve already established schools able manage upholding CDC guidelines safety.  

Yikes. That’s clearly sane sensible parent.  It’s wife got shot. forever grateful woman took info set us up. went way doctor want mRNA vaccines higher protection efficacy SA variant, especially i've promised. 

Title reads little anti-vax I'd probably situation. 100% agree classic case ""social media represent reality"" India produce majority world's vaccines - pharmaceutical industry huge. They're projected produce 3.6bn doses year. Though, Serum (the main producer) iffy selling Canada, somewhat doubt India source vaccines. That's view honestly, means nothing.

Same. much better going waste. Yes. made exception Melbourne keep locking 5-6 months lockdown unethical. ignored rest Australia it’s literally island nation, restrict comes surrounded ocean. Furthermore, reducing number infections getting still infection getting out. Remember France got deaths zero? sure heck aren’t anymore. virus comes in, spreads. doesn’t matter spent 6 months locking down, comes in, aren’t cleansed protected ever covid again. According people local comment section, four severe cases mean shouldn’t anything pandemic let tear humanity unabated. vaccinate Palestinians Kinda big difference millions billions. ""Millions"" least remotely plausible. ""Billions"" obviously impossible. mention ""or more"". believe Victoria also going one clear. Stop likely make infections mild due lower counts Please note every source, along Jerusalem Post article linked originally, specifically states PA publicly said want Israeli help vaccine.

I noted exactly none said that. 

WP, fact, says pretty much “We technical capabilities that,” said Ali Abd Rabbo, director Palestinian Health Ministry Gaza. “We held sessions Israeli side regard, moment agreement.”

WSJ mentions Palestine ask Israel vaccines lack infrastructure store them. Giving Palestine vaccines different vaccinating Palestinians.

And Time PA publicly saying *do* want Israeli Israel “duty” vaccinate Palestinians, Palestinian Authority said statement released Jan 10. constitutes “racial discrimination Palestinian people denial right healthcare.”

Business Insider, I'm assuming article talking ""Israel, Palestinians, COVID-19 vaccination rollout: legal moral obligations"" mentions another article might really interested in:

**Jerusalem Post: [Palestinians say trying get vaccines find article 2 months ago take inerrant truth, assuming every article would pop googled ""Israel Palestine Vaccine"" would say thing?

Meanwhile coworker got like lol feel nothing! could get monthly deposit instead vote every single one. Well that's great news round then.  see thats whole point! people think responsibility protect around you. there's one forcing wear mask, dont think required &amp; cares people around die. fucking disgusting. wear mask time safety others, there's rule, one needs tell me. reason can't focus good news.

I dont know &amp; offhand comment focus bad news. dont need write 5 page essay every comment make weird people understand mean can't infer information 

there 2 types people:
those come conclusion based incomplete information Post viral syndrome also happens flu. Fuck science! /s pretty impossible assume differences something many variables. could said fear monger without substantial proof. many using 'new variants' agenda. problem variant prolongs pandemic. Vaccines work quite good reinfections happen

Again, please provide substantial proof 'reinfections happen' great degree, verified source. Otherwise would suggest consider apply 'trolling' label yourself. That's literally America did. painted taking others. huge effect infection rates. numbers (vaccination) secular sector. religious sector huge corona outbreaks vaccination sector still lacking duo religious reasons/bad infrastructure. secular cities (Tel Aviv, Haifa) infection rate dropping rates religious cities (Bnei Brak) raising. measures decrease incidence Covid almost completely eliminate flu. much adults, still susceptible Pfizer, feeling better day 2 using theory, also possible many people exposed virus. people always seem ignore. safe certain precautions taken...and precautions like ventilation distancing impossible many schools. poster claimed millions, I'm simply agreeing that's either millions billions more. obsessed evidence numbers, replying him? Hopefully vaccination programme speeds enough counter this. last thing mainland Europe needs another wave covid. ... wear masks Walmart's got everything lol thought could get vaccinated hospitals ignore every state Australia free lockdown time.. virtually restrictions, deaths

they silo infection breaks out, problem Imagine that. Recommending everyone get shot way validated. I’m glad you’re rational acknowledge Trump administration contributed Teachers vaccinated soon enough, although I'm pessimistic anywhere yet open reopen summer, unfortunately. 

Students virtually risk COVID. Frankly, die lockdowns COVID. Let parents virtual option needed, 99%, odds severe infection very, small. checked recently, time personally aware suicides among teens COVID deaths one state.

Not mention, kids school infected often home. statistically shown, makes intuitive sense. school, made keep distance, wash hands, etc. suppose average kids outside school so? Jab, poke, shot, cares? great question many Israelis ask well,
We actually got third quarantine last four weeks, country quarantine days far.

The measures easy going, lot going place, example diplomatic pressure keep airways Dubai open normalization agreement, everyone follow rules way (we many types groups) 

The good news see risk groups, got priority vaccine, much smaller percentage sick death counts.

So mentality people vaccines need take care much, variants virus infectious younger ages cause phenomenon.

Hope helped understand little better, truth can't really understand well fullest is! got vaccine month ago I'm bulletproof! 

/s Maybe whole American Revolution sham UK still puppet master. well we're gonna fudge math hard might well make 300 million.  cause mutations could occurred killed everyone. going pretty pissed everything get vaccine ASAP two months line people vaccine category get paid get it, we’re still probably equally forced follow covid restrictions I’m also liberal place see much IRL friends social media. Especially Super Bowl. lot IG stories haven’t seen friends year yet people thought cool go Super Bowl. Stuff like that. owned China. left shit long time ago.  did. People rarely let facts get way self-righteous indignation Holdup, isn'tl healthcare situation socio economic situation well 4th geneva convention occupier responsible that. one who's stating numbers yet provide single shred evidence them.

Can't feel anything unknown, I? jibes Cousin's experience agreed upon hypothesis. Yup. people realise - total spending vaccines across ENTIRE EU less couple days lockdown Germany. EU could bumped vaccine budget multiples still nowhere near cost EU-wide lockdown week. miss normal Phase 2 starts April? Summer gonna lit! (775k) Don’t show American anti vaxxers this, hate stats positive studies vaccines. “Fake news” that... Moderna per study week effective variants. [Link sure isn’t bigger news. thinking maybe ""variants"" + relaxing restrictions causes spike. spike hospitalizations? ***that*** high? Weeks vulnerable vaxxed? pass snif test. all.

Even among people know taking seriously IRL, still outdoor, distanced activities people summer fall making regular out-of-the-house trips like grocery shopping picking takeout. Yeah...this new one never will. Families get $600 every child 16 under.

17 older regardless dependent/Independent status get 1400 fall income threshold based 2020.

Finally got people care writing legislation. satire, right? Yeah, I've same. optimistic around August really started trending went way up. good news though even though second peak twice high first peak back July so, death peak same. school. city Yet lockdowns causing far economic damage worldwide economic cost covid point though. point lie it. course truth always comes one way another. mean intended truth coming out, rather see stayed hidden. truth nasty habit floating surface given enough time. surprise. Walmart foists chunk employment costs onto government.  still get amount mRNA shot? narrative? B117 US three months able take country incredibly lax public health restrictions peak seasonality. that's narrative, that's reality. 

you're welcome peruse comment history convinced i'm crazy denier, really think questions answers regard new variants right now, answers rolling in, they're pointing variant fever overblown. think things open locally travel still limited...at least intercontinental will. Maybe various travel corridors return normalcy within different regions world. Ok -- sorry, that's bit element terms rights law concerned. think different timings waves. US also dropping like crazy, isn’t vaccine yet. India dropped like crazy first wave.

It’s useful look happening people vaccinated, going extremely well according data Israel Uh, know Australia limited restrictions whole time? Melbourne one city Nothing see here. anyway, Florida bad DeSantis Satan, right, r/coronavirus? /s I'm selective all. think anyone state political affiliation that's found manipulating withholding COVID data vilified minimum, outright prosecuted. Ohio process publishing huge backlogs death counts, close 4,000 so. might that. go target walmart. valid reason seize power They've spent months pretending Covid exist there. Life continues normal, clubs weddings full maskless revelers. difference every week hear someone know dying disagreeing you, could variant?  *good* inevitable. ""settling,"" reality. Diseases spread every country Earth never go away entirely. Seems CCP members heavily downvoting comments. even necessary. know body builds immunity gets infected virus. fix broke CDC apparently give shit teachers. state has, yet teachers unions say still isn’t safe go back person. Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ), nation’s leading federal health agency, announced possible schools transition in-person learning without requiring teachers receive Covid-19 vaccine. agency identifed five key “mitigation strategies” priortised reopenign schools: universal correct mask-wearing; physical distancing; washing hands; cleaning facilities providing proper ventilation; contact tracing, isolating, quarantining cases. Government officials responsible reopening individual distribts, faced pushback teacher unions claim schools don’t proper safety measure. Definitely. Case numbers still high, widespread downward trend statewide, nationwide, global scales. promising considering vaccine distribution still early stages. look this, crazy gets.

&amp;#x200B;

It's almost certainty lab leak. Well take common sense further, already virus better immunity vaccine give. bodies naturally built build immunity soon cat bag, never going back in. foregone conclusion February last year going permanent endemic disease. there’s surplus it’ll happen.  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Yet appear lot people quite contented lockdowns even advocating them.  Except Kansas. Though that's reporting sucks even health secretary idea used check worldometer horror every day, check dose optimism. Feels good. Hope continues. even able get 70 percent agree vaccinated? opportunity respond new report yet. report return direct conflict many city's teacher union say safe yet. fed wont/probably cant force reopen I'm interested see admin handles conflict. Opinion: Headlines media small factor contributing conspiratorial thought. root issue education - adequately taught think critically, there's significantly higher chance believing unbased conspiracy. 

I think keep media accountable, someone reads headline immediately jumps deep-state Bill Gates bullshit, problem headline. them. beast saying 80% it’s done like 12-18% actually asymptomatic. Bad flllow up, mild cases, etc caused initial 80% claims we'd never go back normal never going away. even without going back normal, everybody would eventually virus point (hopefully asymptomatic infection post-vaccination). We've eradicated ONE endemic human disease medical history. feasible goal. Put head happen. vaccinate reduce risk much possible, go life. Target continues show preeminence retail peers. 

Not far forward-thinking company terms technology portfolio, also (apparently) belief human employees shouldn’t treated like cattle. 

Seems like would easy decision Wal Mart, almost always make wrong choices comes labor force.  Maybe considering mutation rate. Yet entire world followed footsteps.. Hmm maybe made mistake daily COVID tracker showing 3,532 U.S. fatalities already today even 3:30 EST (12:30 PST). correct seems awfully high early day might states entering backlog? Good read!

most estimates saying B117 arrived US early November, yet still accounts small percentage cases here. account that? 

one likely explanation B117 regional biomarker trying colonize new population center already massive number super-spreading events occurring cases surging control. order that, would need crazy fucking transmission advantage (again, concrete evidence front) get ""lucky"". considering successfully taken US large countries detected, small, densely populated areas like Israel London, none models give dire transmission estimates take super-spreading account, i'm inclined go door #2. guess makes crazy denier though. privileged enough worrying financially support family likely don’t come immigrant family fled totalitarian country. recent case think use nebuliser helped spread virus infected person people working quarantine facility, infectious strain that's kids get sick bring home bugs school, home summer vacation, get sick quite often....... me, ""study"" read like predetermined outcome worked backwards support it, instead real science? It’s absolute garbage spreading misinformation. It’s easy google OP would rather spread misinformation exposed covid 5 days ago someone asymptomatic. experiencing symptoms want get tested cause still go work. get tested 3 times next three days one negative odds three false negatives?

However, reading researchers crawling caves research coronaviruses bats, really hope they're wearing masks situations. sayin' keep watching scaring variants way watch programs! Thank user bluelivessplatter420 Yeah go back phase 1/2 phase 3 deemed failure. thought still track Q4 approval ""improved"" vaccine. JaRule think? principle, agree, already went rabbit hole started demonetizing. see swearing video worse antivax propaganda. things life explained follow money. Ron DeSantis never recover this. /s Incorrect mean, CDC literally met Union officials concoct this. politics, science common sense. They're banned anyway now.  👍 pretty sure USA vaccinate lot people immediately need vaccination it’s even considered let others vaccines ordered. that’s case Europe export USA.

Yeah think that's fair. Lots people USA like it, I'd gladly give world's elderly population Pfizer moderna shota got one evidence may support person education wild type strain.

The cannot said B117 given greater transmissibility. share food first. Seriously, poor countries worried disease kills mostly elderly population life years (or months) left. Covid panic western thing Yeah shit Sherlock love see think dead May (or June latest) looking pretty damn normal US. average 1.5M/day rest February, 2.5M/day March, little 3M/day April, goals hit. 

Like said, that's 250M doses administered ~200M Americans eligible vaccine. decent portion J&amp;J shots require second dose greater 125M done vaccine regiment. Add pile people disease many places virus go US! Teachers didn’t sign risks. tried convincing someone day work. listen simply told I'm ignorant research. That's one thing I've noticed always ""go research"" they'll never give evidence absurd claims Oh I’m saying that. pointing wasn’t working outdoors ski slope like thinking originally. logic extremely hungover taking 25 shots one night good thing. basically demonstrates drink contained alcohol liver still working. saying we're way reality antibodies 80% reduced chance infection. What's happening suspect people going probably mostly got virus. people staying home continuing stay home careful get it. think we're woods yet same. ok never getting exchange everyone’s Grandma get it. virus equivalent least one shot cases midwest plummeted thanksgiving December, really spike Christmas either. holidays alone enough drive surge. Virtually one promising lockdowns summer. States already started opening up, obviously continue vaccination speeds up. 69 - nice....  
But hitting 2 million today awesome unfortunately turn case Theory vs Practice. sounds great theory. practice, might nightmare. TGT stock 55% last 6 months. turns make money shareholders complete piece shit (looking WMT). Yeah! mean, fear *scared* 475,000 Americans dying! bought narrative! word yet recommend higher education? assholes fucked country (US) ever saw absolute crap poor victims go dying covid, think would careful bit less selfish enough supply that? Safety theater. We're still violated tsa every time fly hijackings happened 20 years ago, despite almost terrorist plots airplanes since then. year several times impactful local, everyday level 9/11 was. can't push reset much (mostly justified, fair) paranoia right away. Hypothetically, could get AstraZeneca soonish wait bunch months get Pfizer Moderna, younger, healthy person, would choose? Thanks bringing attention. Nice discussing :) don't, agree infection. guess also works out. Yes they'll counted completely vaccinated since one dose. Biden used 23 100 days.

To hit spring vaccination targets, daily average (currently 1.62M/day) reach 2M/day later 03/11 (27 days now), continue accelerate rate reach 3.06M 04/30.

Of course, reach 2.00M/day sooner 03/11, acceleration 3.06M/Day required order reach spring targets. acceleration required depend soon 2.00M/day reached. find celebrating interesting. We're levels November, numbers atrociously bad compared happening months before. We're woods, yet. I'm dooming, reticent behaving current trends guaranteed keep going down. Yeah couldn’t infected guests. Lol Fair enough, :) complaining about? article: 
1) media 
2) saying we're \_not\_ completely screwed

There \_were\_ genuine concerns. data, know more. doubt good towards employees, less employees get sick work vaccinating then? Indiana middle/upper done nursing homes, healthcare, &amp; first responders. started 80+.70+, 65+ - everyone categories know able schedule appt get shot. states, even WV, seem opaque process... COVID tracker using? talking that. talking people believe kids high risk, widespread long term illness seen yet, ""we know yet"". Look comment threads vaccinations kids see this. “Most cases traced back social gatherings outside work congregate housing,” Outside Israel, UK, US, countries boat. got hit hardest Pfizer delays (mostly small player compared EU). Judging performance early isn’t helpful - always going rocky start, well way meeting targets set out. fact, we’re likely going moving September date quick order (more vaccine approvals, hopefully exports US later summer). Addressing concerns vaccines preventing disease, transmission. “asymptomatic” transmission mostly coming people soon develop symptoms therefore would listed case trials less need worry vaccinated people accidentally spreading virus place.

Honestly, get vaccine trials testing participants weekly basis determine they're actually healthy asymptomatic Covid. get initially enough tests, testing capacity really issue anymore. think really bad communication tweet. yes, going 23 million cumulative make sense. 

But Globe Mail says Anand say press conference 23 million April end June, hopefully that's end concern subsequent press conference Procurement Minister Anita Anand said two companies deliver combined 23 million shots April June – 20 million first expected time. result 1.5 million Canadians able get shots spring. timeline getting Canadians shots remains hearing broken record since May. 

Not hilarious anymore still every bit deluded. Conflicted getting vaccine since I’m breastfeeding...my dr told it’s decision. Everything read says “theoretically, there’s reason get it” pregnant &amp; breastfeeding women weren’t included trials isn’t technically safety data. insight? appointment tomorrow.. Ok, 1, need put fear porn. hundreds millions infections worldwide, probably 100M US, certainly 30M ""disabled"" people here.

2, also need accept reality reality. Endemic diseases go away. numbers odds see locally. entire county got 60 doses week.

Our state's vaccine delivery 50%.

In regions, LA closed 5 large vaccination locations vaccine.

While hear great news national level, translating local vaccine availability. appear ability put needles arms, available doses vaccine.

I hope states better actually receiving vaccine.    Show huge comment.

There side effects, they're better disease. Scary stuff. get treated second class citizen don’t want vaccine? even matter everyone else vaccinated? 

Yellow stars next? issue goes beyond COVID another factor made pandemic devastating here. mRNA lucky efficacy COVID-19, diseases. stopping investment vector vaccines might best idea. Still, Sputnik vaccine 90% vaccine, often vaccines efficacy around 60/70%. 

They still investing protein vaccines (Sanofi/GSK NovaVax), even older technology (vector vaccines relatively new) even older conventual whole inactivated virus vaccine (ebola vaccine uses example). still invested in. NovaVax vaccine highly effective too, Valneva working second generation whole inactivated virus vaccine.

These multiple weapons fight viruses. mRNA vaccine might effective certain virus, could still try vector, protein whole virus vaccines. continue investing become technology, make better. invest mRNA vaccines out, might restrict much. Definitely good news - see engines turning vaccine operation efficiency gain major win. 

OT: I'm curious J&amp;J vaccine used rolls out. mRNA vaccines clearly amazing, J&amp;J seems like it'd ideal choice lower-risk people want get single dose convenience doctor's office pharmacy. Haha, May 30th bride here... glad I'm one! guess would argue knowing R number isn’t life death. said “we wear mask?!” would back snark.

This recent holiday season fact drive massive surge, US exceeded 100k cases/day quite now. Sure, seems unlikely extend Aug, \_everything\_ wrong. heard ""secured"" [those - poor job government done ""securing"" anything. also syringe makers produce syringes, I'd shocked Canada would ahead line receive these. Right, important separate permanently asymptomatic people two reasons:

1. Addressing concerns vaccines preventing disease, transmission. “asymptomatic” transmission mostly coming people soon develop symptoms therefore would listed case trials less need worry vaccinated people accidentally spreading virus place.

2. determines much mass testing needs prioritized. test way diagnose asymptomatic case, people recently exposed frequently get false negative results therefore told wait get tested anyway. ""We KNOW! There's much virus know, new unique can't ever know anything matter many rigorous tests studies done! scientific papers guesses, can't ever TRULY know!""

""Oh, headline twitter says neck gaiters bad? I'm going believe ardently next 8 months attack anti-science disagree"" VACCINATIONS 👏 AREN’T 👏 👏 👏 THING 👏 👏 CONTRIBUTES 👏 👏 HERD 👏 IMMUNITY

Honestly. fact models keep forgetting account ~75 million Americans likely already degree immunity due previous infection baffling. Thankful good news vaccine front. We're surrendering, we're attacking greatest medical weapon something like this, vaccinations.  got mine yesterday! well-oiled machine volunteers made happen. risk children get COVID spread adults life. use whether people understand policy decisions guided science good litmus test see actually understand complex interconnected system is. I've seen that, thanks. I'd counter R number virus esoteric factoid par Mentos Coke. actually serious ramifications us. know, life-and-death stuff.

Sorry, say: I'm talking COVID-19, checking everyone's heard yeah? contradict headline. rate vaccination improve, mean shortages issue right now. Can’t wait cell tower inside get 6G vaccine next pandemic! Illinois best day almost 100K vaccinated. Everyone apartment least one shot What's wrong informative? misleading irrelevant, issue here.  small. flu also cause myocarditis people never lost mind that. should.

Honestly worse that. Confine ordering things Instacart. Make hurt. Make something one, matter antivaxx, justify life. reason be? We’ve put best position given current state pharmaceutical industry.

Weird, ~45 countries personal vaccine plants country, somehow 25% globe able figure things Trudeau not. appreciate optimism. We're moving fast Oregon, OHA honest it'll many weeks get 1B. even then, 1C 1D whatever, I'll able get vaccination open season.

I'd love wrong, I'd happily pay could bribe way shot later mid-April :). traveling first week May. word advice- avoid main page thread R going UK want keep sanity. 

anyone says variant fever might overblown enough information apparently ""covid denier"" sudden Good Obviously nothing safe fully vaccinated visit, matter data comes out.

I won’t seeing parents person they’re vaccinated fully, week second dose fully kick — work hospital icu, shifts month still risk exposure. But, personal choice, may different wanted give perspective someone similar situation. “increased restrictions” joke. closed outdoor dining hair salons, everything else open. size bottle vaccine less air. size bottle means basically manufacturing equipment still work, eases bottleneck putting tops bottles. true, plus possible get re-infected variant twice anyway, exactly huge surprise point. long term outlook pandemic gotten objectively significantly better people less susceptible scare bait corporate media. 

also, lot past doom-and-gloom predictions vaccines working, safe, one taking them, holidays driving surges, 100k cases per day US August, on.... turned wrong. people looking information they're receiving critical eye. FL? Honestly, state lied numbers point? source Canada enough dead space syringes? understanding Canada order 40M 2M delivered week. third world's population disabled. Great. That's exactly want. it? Asymptomatic infections prevent organ damage long hauler. Trudeau best. need support positive. Indeed actual situation complex, general assumption incorrect. waiting line. Paying less signing contract later might lead making good deal. made decent deal lower price later, made better deal, right vaccine quarter ones paid earlier. Unless explicitly stated contract. two contracts EU released mention influenced external contracts. contract matters, contracts supplier made others problem, pharmaceuticals problem. Even ""best efforts"". contracts matter ""best efforts"". contracts countries available, EU contracts can't compare country's contracts. Maybe everyone made ""best efforts"" contract. Yup.... got vaccine. irony right? imagine kid, teacher tells class, ""now class, need protect wearing masks, wear sent home."" idk effective mandates would point...

s/ satirical prosed question start discussion, idfk even tosay this... watch it. reason new variants. cant anything it. step outside 9pm get 200€ fine here. appears acting cagey respect China. China far transparent, keeps making announcements style reserved counties fully cooperate. Here, here! keep given examples keep moving goalposts. Asymptomatic transmission unusual. CDC office jobs next, particularly parents rushed schools open teacher vaccinations people get injection Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine counted completed vaccinations I'm assuming right guess question would duration effectiveness? know natural immunity recovery vary greatly person person there’s debate serious case need activate CD+4 8 cells. also know, least Pfizer, they’ve clearly stated they’re concerned immunity duration one injection. So, me, seems like could potential disaster. missing something? Never going work. Get ready news stories breakouts schools.

It impossible open schools safely people vaccinated. Period.

""Some may die, that's risk I'm willing take."" Cabin fever think. Vaccine nationalism goes long way, yes.  don’t want understand don’t answer. don’t even want advocate $5-10k month 2 years, claim want stimulus government assistance. reason said incentive lot vaccine hesitation sometimes individuals need little motivation get vaccine. There's really room basic common sense virology. asymptomatic people rarely ever transmit.

and differentiate presympomatic? make actionable difference? hypocrite? I’m stay home person, feel outdoor activities fine long people aren’t other’s faces. Eh checked rest profile longer want understand Again, scientific facts say damage happens roughly 30%. countries eliminated virus effective vaccines probably 70% population gets them. guys indoor dining gyms! neither recovered covid October/Novemberish I'm vaccinated. First dose actually worse second dose! sucked though (ofc vaccine effects cakewalk compared covid) That's said mid April. 150 million people, plus people already gotten gotten vaccinated (whatever number is) enough herd immunity, certainly enough crater new cases.  call reinfection? Different strains flu different flus,yes? covid19? I’ll pay private clinic across us border get Pfizer/Moderna vs AZ confidence increased lot around 50% number, still range know remain similar different context time year? ain’t debate tho lol atleast I’m trying debate anything idk link got taken la times... regardless sharing wouldn’t want vaccine let’s say moderna  sounds like reading fast.
You may want slow try again.

I ""blame"" NDP instituting program UCP shut down..
I specifically said NDP waited election year offer program benefited citizens promised citizens prior elected. could implemented program moment took office?

As far parties suck concerned. saying want focus good bad parties weigh difference? saying focusing negative one party another party?

If noticed, never said anything positive UCP quite frankly, nothing positive say them.

Finally, Avro Nortel. know anything situation yourself? Feel free enlighten do. states restrictions anyone wants get vaccinated can. call May June? California wait 2023 R number new cases, average, every case causes. R(t) number given time, R0 R number one immune one makes effort avoid virus. 

R0 Covid somewhere 2 4, means every case, initially, cause 2-4 cases. Say go 3. every cases causes another 3 cases, first round, index patient causes 3 cases. purposes example, say takes entire 10-day infectious period cause 3 cases, none cases transmit next period.

So it’s day 11, 3 people it, gotten directly index patient. index patient recovered, population consists millions immunity doesn’t matter modeling near future. 3 current cases, next 10 days, create another 3 cases. day 21, 9 current cases, 4 recovered (the three recovered plus index patient). days 21 30, 9 cause 27 new cases, 3 each, recover. 13 recovered day 31, 27 remain infected. total case history 40 now.

So see every time disease’s course passes simplified model, virus spreads factor 3. means model spread equation C(t) = 3^t number 10-day periods passed since index patient became infected. that’s R0

But hold on. virus can’t spread rate 3^t forever. People who’ve previously virus mostly become immune, enough people others around start noticing something going around, they’re going start avoiding it. means hand-washing, masks, maybe staying home, since things deviations normal behavior, R(t), present value, down. mix people immune (and thus failing contract virus otherwise would 1 3) people avoiding (and thus lowering number people infected person exposes virus first place), R(t) value falls 1, sudden means every case creating less 1 new case. look like? Well let’s imagine end previous example, major lockdown instituted (since people immune, likely way get R(t) 1). lockdown pushes R(t) 2/3 1, 0.67. Now, can’t 2/3 case, really means essence 2 every 3 cases go create new case, others fail so. day 41, 27 cases caused 18 recovered themselves. day 51, 18 current cases cause 12. day 61, 8. forth, virus decaying away. 

Eventually, government able identify last people carry virus quarantine longer virus takes recover from, R(t) drops 0. quarantined individuals recover, virus said *eliminated*, meaning one region it. virus *eliminated* everywhere world, said *eradicated*. That’s final goal long term. Drive cases low individual cases reliably found quarantined, denying opportunity spread virus, resulting eventually eradication. Wal-mart pays employees sub-subsistence wages signs public assistance get job. subsidize inhumane business model tax money. corporate welfare queen. I’ve heard Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine doesn’t cause allergic reactions nearly much Moderna Pfizer ones. approved soon, could hold one. Conspiracy theories rooted distrust government. saying true, mistrust understood. clear media pushing lot fear past year, make killing pandemic. true. make people uneasy, issues presented fairly. 

Also, plenty idiocy legitimized mainstream media right now, take look around many people refuse basic, reasonable, common-sense mitigation measures, hard fault people reacting even extreme takes.

I'm sympathetic people angry everyone endangering others absolutely comeuppance. somebody started firing gun blindly air defended actions with, ""Well there's 1 10000 chance I'll actually hit somebody kill them,"" persuasive argument favor letting people shoot guns anywhere anytime? ""Oh, well afraid killing someone, simply gun. I'll continue use mine recklessly."" That's people sub saying fucking every goddamn day. News agencies seeing end rope Covid clicks. 

Trump gone. Coronavirus way out. Government seems getting back track. 

After impeachment, what’s left binge consume? Nah, remember attitude copped Victoria lockdowns. I'm good. I'm behind pc share it. 

The numbers EU based Dutch government source quarterly deliveries vaccine. Netherlands gets 3,89%, divided amounts 3,89%.

The US numbers significantly less reliable. gathered data Reddit post cited multiple news sources amounts. think UK already B117 surge, US avoid one continuing current vaccination course. 


But mere fact R currently 1 UK invalidate hypothesis variant 50% transmissible, poster said. hard-proven Pfizer (really) better SA Brazilian variant. think efficacy easy taken context, especially pick infection treat disease

I understand doctors think they're playing best move, also undermining Astrazeneca's reputation country, nicknamed many ""the Series B vaccine"" (yeah, Italy personal problem soccer)

It get better vaccine skepticism increase Mate isn’t suffering olympics? one right shit others acts others, let’s get yeah? Pretty much true every vaccine understanding, mRNA vaccines remain effective. native language apt expression this. called ""paraculo"". literally hide ass dangers responsability (getting vaccine).

btw there's second class citizenship whatsoever. want vaccine whatever anti-scientific delusion floating boat, fine. go get tested want shit. freedom earned via responsability. case, covid free. point (I suspect) spudulika making people conflate EU ""Europe"".

It's ""politics vs geography"" question, either. Non-EU countries like Britain, Norway Switzerland deep cultural, economic political links rest Europe.

Using ""Europe"" refer EU often hidden meaning behind it: sometimes done imply people want EU less European, even anti-European. least probably infectious people already virus. seems like logical conclusion want sceptical. EU: We're slow approve vaccines everybody else wrong, must cutting corners want take time.

*EU falls behind rest world...

EU: We're going join rest world get stuff approved deployed, cutting corners we're right. Let’s say natural infection vaccine, levels antibodies decline time. memory cells? Would enough quell future infection? live spleen lymphatic system beauty symbolic. photo captures fragility human life strength human spirit. two people know time quickly ending consoled undying love one another. human body far helpless CoronaVirus NON-VARIANTS (""COVID-19 version 1.0"", is) also.

It's serious disease, death sentence. many people still think latter. 3 million lol. Google “coronavirus” friend. Covid-19 wasn’t first one, wasn’t even hundredth one. think whipped vaccines quick? They’ve studying family viruses quite while. politely fuck requests evidence. That’s like asking someone else homework you. armpit swollen second Pfizer shot. Lasted 3-4 days. Worth though. Really interested plot. Could share it?
Bedankt eh ;) Man 2019 normal never coming back even vaccines governments worldwide stated normal never coming back. Get used large indoor outdoor events like concerts sports ect ect. family gatherings ever quite clear, I'm vehemently pro-vax. eagerly await turn.

But policies little authoritarian taste irony much resist. amount people going long term damage infections, yes. I'm telling you, one, ""a third world's population disabled"" hysterical hyperbole and, two, eradicating virus. learn accept that. hoax, eh? doctors refusing, country vials batch information trace chain custody obtained originally. yeah, hesitate. 1point3acres.com Despite massive lockdowns cities? well phizer looks effective variants right? AZ decent african, good phizer right? Yeah figured. I’d pretty happy odds. quite honestly suspected that. virus mutates much order evade vaccines would change spike protein drastically. changed much 'rona can't enter human cells anymore, particulary strain can't infect anyone anymore. even immune answer somewhat changes spike protein - let's say - 1/10 answer thrain developed still extremely effective. dilute blood vaccinated people several hundredfold laboratory testing order even measure lower immuneresponse since serum vaccinated people CRUSHES viral strains exposed to. broke right provide protection reinfection, however Covid idea long natural immunity lasts.

With pandemic scale level transmission last thing want peoples natural immunity end threat virus mostly gone.

By giving people booster ""trick"" immune system thinking Covid common (and world without lockdowns, probably anyway) provide longer lasting immunity remembering virus footprint longer.

Sure people may ""infected"" 2nd time natural booster however something shutdown world whole year, put hopes alternative confident in. I’ve severe allergic reactions vaccines younger, one landed ER. spoke doctor he’s currently consulting colleagues make sure still able take covid vaccine. happens I’m unable take though? Yes.

The difference still reduced chance deliveries increased Q1 and/or Q2. Also holding less stock second dose extending time two doses difference reduced. one May!  taking J&amp;J account? help starting April people think highest number shots US given single day time over? felt like drunk Moderna vaccine day of. mild headache take tylenol injection site little sore. nothing I'm two days feel fine side effects. probably even going see even drop coronavirus cases cold weather week next. People stay home naturally already quarantining cause weather awful.  Right would take AZ. make want 9-12 weeks second shot. get offer July take doubt I'll able travel freely one shot. Umm well really long since they've out. thibk jumping gun. really take time evaluate actual affect people long run. Especially since animal trials done. Yay, lab rats!

Joe Biden said everyone vaccinated end summer Given variants seem able mutate spike protein epitopes without strongly affecting fitness ACE2 binding actually evidence hypothetically able achieve escape immunity. actually pretty solid hypothesis based occurrence variants. variants spike produced much lower binding replication cost fitness it'd suggestive escape immunity might come high cost.

I would bet money immune escape happen. also, however, bet money remotely doomsday. 1918 H1N1 pandemic achieved escape immunity circulated seasonal influenza greatly reduced impact. We're going see something similar happen ultimate impact common cold seasonal influenza -- vaccines available able mitigate impact even further.

It going mutate, going achieve escape immunity, endemic, something get terrified generate clickbait headlines. get shots. Way ignore whole ""anti-maskers holding protests whenever feel like it"" part way UK ""handled"" covid.

Or British government dragged feet fucked every point.

But hey, long get cherrypick bullshit feel smart, that's important thing. I’m sorry beautiful? Previous infection guarantee immunity towards new strains.

If covid July I'm exposed UK SA variant, could become reinfected.

I think that's main reason leaving Walmarts Targets pharmacies?

I would figured chains, especially given size, would able secure vaccine (when becomes widely available) --- offer vaccinations on-site employees.  But...you’ll vaccinated? *scratches head* market, faster full effectiveness. Even could stretched, bother way lengthening study time? 

There's good chance longer interval booster actually effective. 

Almost zero established vaccines adults short gap booster. 

In theory want booster trigger reaction immune memory cells rather primarily remaining response initial dose.

Not Pfizer wrong try get study done approval sorted ASAP. let's pretend variables thoroughly studied expedited trials. There's never nuance conversations. one saying B.1.1.7 real, they're saying due vaccines timing, slowdown maybe small spike spring (though hope wrong even that). Implying there's going even worse peak makes sense anymore--and there's much evidence show even vaccines good, they're still good that's better 0 Sure, true reinfection far often milder first infection. case opposite, hence making false 1st infection plausible. Even [scientific one swab done September - claim reinfection would far valid swab repeated there's mention it. good? don’t understand people happy support laws give government control lives. literally lock society down, give curfews ban seeing loved ones year there’s still people going ‘woohoo! Good news! restrictions!’.

Like...this society. comfortable sort stuff going on? problem think actually Demand, probably mid may early june, Demand vaccines drop off. awful reaction every vaccine. first moderna shot yesterday. tired, minor headache arm soreness. Still bit fatigued today bad means. 

The pneumonia vaccine kicked ass. Fever, joint pain, rash. covid one mild comparison. It’s interesting observe overall case numbers similar per capital versus California simple enough five year old understand, feeble mind thanks  That'd come personal choice without assumption others keep quarantining.

The benefit Johnson Johnson vaccine gets done faster, we're point matters lot. Johnson Johnson vaccine get people vaccinated summer mRNA vaccines till end summer, months matter people, general precautions much longer. Anyone else refreshing Bloomberg every 10 minutes waiting see made 50 million? Nice. theory we’ve run dumbasses don’t wear masks social distance. got cases dropping. there's also many recovered symptom free. there's mutation problem. there's people can't get vaccinated health reasons. people get vaccinated, better long term. might delirious, pissed off, tired dude getting old. perhaps considering things related context ""when nation x (in case israel) opens up"". risk categories + sizeable chunk population get inoculated cases go down, believe need measures.

if vaccine safety, healthy individual get vaccine protect unable receive one? excerpt:

No one forgetting Trudeau promised 6 million doses March 31. promised 6 million doses March 31, today.  Q1 ends March 31, March 15.  Pfizer Moderna assured Canada going meet contractual obligations Q1. Pfizer easily based current supply schedule given. Schools open many states almost year. fear porn schools war zones ravaged covid happened Well Florida literally detriment country, actual factual measurable ways, California represents huge chunk economy. dislike idiotic reason like “they’re liberal” us brain realize “too progressive” stupid reason disown state Herd immunity realistic variants. better endpoint would preventing severe disease elderly people comorbidities. grammar bad enough pretty much sums sort argument people like you.

‘selfish’ - check

How 

Freedom
Of
Choice know one theory rising temperatures, ancient bacteria/viruses frozen polar caps could freed. practice nightmare, that's exactly cdc made recommendations. know covid cast majority children unaffected, whereas virtual school significant affect learning expressed thru test scores still need distribute them. doses available anyways. Ya take 2000IU daily since October. 20k still deficient? That’s surprising. nice. can't wait buy excess supply you, USA!

Signed, Canada.
Please god soon. wanna see movies again. without context, post extremely misleading confusing. Even now. like fairly arbitrary numbers still wait statistics make decision. think mostly used 1 ""good job!"" people.

It nothing graph already do. Swollen lymph node? Sounds like Cuomo Democrat version Trump.  Maybe worse.

""undercounted""?  anything like ""lied"" Go parts US Eastern Europe. Rest western world lockdown obsessed body, choice. society choose choice negative consequences.

Good taking personal responsibility actions. let know movies beach are. Enjoy super market guess. ...what said? extremely strict lock long time now. risk groups likely show symptoms therefor get tracked vaccinated.

 see could make statement confidence considering circumstances. Never said wasn’t. actually believe this??? Well, far know, ""country"" ""state"" sinonyms anyway. country/language refer country state well, depending word choose. EU countries also referred ""member states"" EU. mean see would make asshole call EU countries states said makes ""big headed"".

And european countries consist smaller counties. USA states consist of? Also smaller counties, far know (correct I'm wrong though). That's USA EU feels similar me, consist countries/states consisting even smaller counties. Hopefully see coming from.

Again, know technically said incorrect, got meant that. Though adming wrong anyway, India also fucking huge, point stand. see what's hate for, lol. Smaller spaces, people per space, cross contacts students changing rooms, often old buildings need upgrades, interaction population often asymptomatic, parents already sent sick kids school years get house, many more. 

Teaching done remotely. jobs cannot. minimizing contacts right cases subsiding, woods long shot. No, not. science saying teachers unions putting reopening ventilation structural issues. ones opposed opening every teacher received vax outweigh risks keeping schools closed Yes. answering perspective. article reads similar countries roll vaccines. fair, comes medical biology chemistry degree we've advanced, using 'just different lipids' Karen equivalent assuming chlorine sodium chloride lethal. second shot acts booster. Ahhh what? Every person get spread others. 97 survival rate isn’t issue, see crushed hospital long termers.

Further, takes one person mutant virus appear *isnt* covered vaccine. Best bet coverage fast possible. that, pressuring repentant ones reasonable.

Those refusing vaccines put us take risk lock downs. temporary inconvenience impacts everyone around them.

Self 99 percent cases deeply sorry loss. Dad sounds like incredible man, legacy remain every patient treated addition loved ones. close again. seem recall something lions christians. Please refer previous comments chain cases rise again. even read article? 

It's ""no"", ""depends/not sure"" ""probably not"" risk dying get covid far higher risk dying vaccine don’t put someone’s choice selfish put others risk someone else’s right safe covid can’t get vaccine. think happened California soon restrictions eased? *spread spread widely*. "" ...the B117 growth rate among samples doubled every 10 days, suggesting 35% 45% higher transmissibility strains (29% 37% California, 38% 49% Florida).""

Just comparing strains seems. would describe confidence steadily increasing. takes lot months sure anything science, evidence seem converging around it. safety precautions arent schools able meet within cdc recommendations? like sudden mistrust cdc intentions goes narrative virus going eradicated, ease restrictions responsibly occurs much earlier suggesting. course sounds bad intentionally distort worse anyone wants. Sorry live area got worst parts lockdown worst parts opening up, though, maybe I'd think differently LA too. forgetting children. magically immunity get vaccines Fall. getting spreading covid without symptoms without tested cases reported, sent back in-person school. reach herd immunity early getting covid.

As every post kids covid, I'll point long-term health effects unknown, even ""asymptomatic"" cases (not sick enough think covid) shown cause lung pulmonary damage. holidays likely little morning wintertime surge. People need stop repeating that. typical viral behavior. peaks troughs. See first two waves Covid US three waves Spanish Flu. Good. Ah ok. even noticed sort new. lol anyone want master's degree erasmus restrictions fucking over? want party scared lockdown implemented every week... honest, can’t comprehend second half sentence colors perceived validity first half, don’t know help. It’s basic rhetorical strategy. 

If write “fireman predicts safe summer winter fires roar” it’s blatantly painfully obvious second clause makes fireman sound like full shit eyes stink. Even factually fires worse winter area JohnQ can’t add anything conversation first grader grammar correction.  CVS runs pharmacies Target constrained whether CVS access vaccine. US started shipping vaccines pharmacy chains week may future, also Targets without pharmacies policy least helps ensure workers chance get it. easy fair us Floridians think DeSantis terrible job literally mocks doctors scheduled press briefings refuses follow CDC advice.

He's massive hypocrite, ordering Florida Highway Patrol set checkpoints state border crossings enforce travel bans yet week whining possibility federal government instituting travel bans.

As second hypocrite example, told Hillsborough Schools (one largest school districts country) could make decision opening, adjusted calendar slightly consulting office reneged fought them.

His police also raided house Rebekah Jones, whistleblower covid issues, pointing guns children clearly threat all, even commit crime alleged committing almost evidence yet: sending message professionals using system literally everyone world access to, incompetent government shared single username password every employee well published public website.

He refused comply valid requests information filed prominent Florida news agencies investigating covid pandemic. 

I'd love able say governor decent job. Many metrics decent, fact Ron DeSantis repeatedly lying harassing people obfuscate data makes doubt performance. none things happened might thought surprisingly well even though vote him. Note none related covid performance basis policy. They're self-imposed damage benefited nobody yet them.

There plenty places think able better, seen countless stories terrible situations like seniors waiting cars hours go home without vaccine, websites crashing, multiple websites separately offering vaccine differently, state offering new combined website multiple counties even use. could change policy distribute vaccines, giving Florida National Guard example instead Publix (curious corruption well, defendable policy choice). could adjust vaccines given places put arms within couple days. could take vaccine demonstration (again fair since he's fairly low risk). could institute mandatory mask orders least stop fighting orders jurisdictions enact. could prioritize communities higher risk, Black communities zip codes service workers higher risk dying well spreading virus.

I think fair everything go perfectly, doubt there's anywhere planet done perfect job. think done policy things differently, least there's ostensibly argument certain policies. think fair let hook consistent lies hypocrisy. could firmly stuck policy choices witjout unforced errors. Schools Indiana open since August. protocols followed. Teachers leaving absolute droves. dumb way present conclusion, probably purposefully clicks. Vit C Zinc fight virus, bolster immune system...which fights virus. virus, matter. there's argument Vit C Zinc strengthen immune system. So.....they still *beneficial.*

It's like saying food water cannot used weapon defeat enemy battle, use supplying troops food water. Yes, sure yes. Factories running 100 percent construction. fuck want? 50% transmissible mean faster burnout. shocked surprised.




... Lol really post first one got downvoted? sub. consistently 5-10k upvoted pics people beach tons excuses ok ski resorts open bc lodges closed. Even tho issue same. People going crowd grocery stores houses Personally, hope immunity artificial means tricking immune system. vaccine around long time maybe would think differently, really confidence power immune system. also take consideration time viruses , taking booster shots raise immunity virus get weaker longer here? Seems backwards me. Could applicable old people general population much risk, seems unnecessary. think happen soon restrictions lifted? vanish away? want virus gone, need keep out. long virus gone global scale? Probably mid late 2022. That’s two years. Omg, mutations killed many many millions spanish flu. joke want be. Living god damn dream. J&amp;J AZ vaccines soon

Those two manufacturers submitted final product review PHAC. surely vast majority people vaccinated natural herd immunity fact risk categories (elderly vulnerable) protected means sheer risk groups getting a) virus b) symptoms c) symptoms anything cough temperature unbelievably miniscule it’s worth blackmailing everyone else take vaccine for? answer lockdowns somehow must apply 2 years, don't. started ignoring facts already established, clear going keep discussing good faith. trying get advocate something also advocate for? No, they're not. Good lord. That's good point! bit doubtful order magnitude myself. No, still applies. 100% ""Could Bitcoin become next Gamestop?"" there’s vaccine. loved ones literally safe vaccine. even matter walk past someone supermarket isn’t vaccinated? 

It’s nothing safety vaccine. Young, healthy people simply don’t need vaccine something survival rate 97% millions people recovered symptom free. It’s also freedom choice. betrayal coming inside sub!

You correct math add up.

Funny nobody questioning math news release, title article best spin I'd expect CBC terrible news.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau concealing - yet - nefarious truth manufacturer's vaccine delivery reduction cancellation applies CanSino, Pfizer, Moderna Johnson Johnson.

Nobody seems want remember last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau still promising target six million doses delivered end March.

Pfizer originally going deliver total four million doses first quarter,  while Moderna was set deliver 2 million doses - delivery targets promised Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

As week, Canada received 1.4 million doses Moderna Pfizer products (short 3.6 million doses).

Pfizer committed next two weeks delivery of 878,000 more Pfizer shots, 888,000 March 15th. Meanwhile, Moderna committed shipping 168,000 doses their vaccine over next two weeks.

All told, expect delivery 3,334,000 shots March 15. That means two manufacturers short 2,666,000 doses combined Trudeau promised.

Coincidentally, next quarters deliveries 2.8 million . . . yeah, get irony. hardly holocaust. list people likely suffer covid likely endanger people around them, permitting society get back track vs list people CHOOSE included category. trying hard resort name calling Same. 2.5 year old afraid people. surprised see them. kept home first 6 months life covid became thing 20 months old. She’s 14 months normalcy, 17 months isolation.

I took target recently early high risk hours (both dad high risk) excited also weirded see “real people” kept saying “I want see real people! real people?” saw stats showing people overestimating death rate factor 100. words, typical person thinks they'd 20% chance dying, 0.2% chance, roughly speaking. science saying completely safe open schools ^^if ^^a ^^list ^^of ^^safety ^^precautions ^^is ^^followed ^^^that ^^^most ^^^schools ^^^couldn't ^^^possibly ^^^hope ^^^to ^^^achieve. 

The result massive nationwide push open schools without meeting safety precautions. following science, purposefully putting school districts position pressured open ""the experts say safe"" ""if this"" part swept rug. ummmmmm
You might want go users post history going huge rants.
If would see defend Trudeau probably much do.... isnt proven all. still actual evidence such. justification share % cases grew disproportionally strains. time, share % cases attributed strain shrinking lot places curfews. SF forces businesses shut 10 pm. makes sense though. Curfews effective limiting spread COVID given bats nocturnal. pessimists right non-stop since covid started. things really improving, appreciate too. Turning reddit sort optimist cult sunshine help vaccination effort. everyone get vaccinated? Pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, etc could vulnerable. AstraZeneca, Johnson Johnson, Novavax mix....

If supporting information delivery schedules manufacturers contained article. I'm still taking anyways immune system.  social darwinism, they've saying, asking for, entire time: get it, that's problem. 

Now second concern: explanations vaccines made repeatedly. made every reputable organization related public health America. seen public officials, including president, vice presidentS, yes, plural, senators, governors congresspeople, etc get vaccine tv hopes proving people danger. response? ""They're faking it."", ""We know syringe."", ""They're taking x they'll give us poison control population."" single explanation, single appeal, already made vaccine. initial ""success"" may directly contributed ""failure"" second round. suppress virus, comes back vengeance take foot brakes. 

That's problem lockdown strategy. ""succeeds"" (discounting societal damage) highly effective vaccination around corner. Otherwise prolongs pandemic delays natural immunity. deal talking Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna doses? medical precautions give part concerned data showed, proven accurate, covid infections left spread without resistance would cause essentially societal disaster inundation collapse healthcare services. 

Covid health societal issue, negative effects intertwined. specifically feared doomsday scenario hospitals reaching capacity, medical services becoming inaccessible event emergencies, people dying treatable things like car accidents, causing mass societal panic. saw hospitals could hit capacity even precautions keep things control, doctors actually 100% correct fear happening. thing. also feel paranoid cautious, can't babies get sick! Alright guys, I’m getting first dose Moderna tomorrow morning. I’m pretty nervous, I’ve taken lot vaccines life mom always tried get us date shots whole different ballgame. I’m nervous mostly it’s brand new. anti vaxxers already gotten Covid

Source? least anecdotally, people know who've gotten Covid hard working healthcare folks. anti-vaxxers covidiots extended family far gotten scot free.  That's great, instead two dose, give many one dose UK variant takes like rocket.... 10 days symptoms completely gone. *actual* data *also* says unlikely severe symptoms, not?

I personally know three people gotten it. One people (and entire family, know) symptoms all. contact traced got tests stayed home two weeks. Another headache first day symptoms, hanging home. One said felt like flu two days home next twelve days.

Statistically, that's normal. Thank support. I’m hoping soon well 🤞 Things I'm gonna next week I'm 1 week post 1st shot

-feel less fear go eat

Otherwise, phrase 'CAN vaccinated'. I.e. adults vaccinated vaccinated choice. definitely develop booster. Even though still work well understand still took insignificant efficacy hit SA variants. Yeah there’s reason don’t science asking one random doctor anecdotes  believe you, truly never leave house, never see anyone, recieve packages, etc. fine. Like said though, believe you. Pediatric covid mortality risk appears quite bit lower flu.  lot people realize many kids, often healthy, die influenza every year. kids always get flu shot - also spend flu season panicking, either. kids also get covid vaccine fully approved pediatric use, really little extra risk reduction. 

Overall, mortality risk healthy children thankfully extremely low covid influenza. ...yes. That's half country. fact people continually break quarantine still really pisses reason, it’s even worse people I’m don’t access NHS, sick disabled fend even worse we’ve 4 years anti-science pumped throats anti-maskers actively trying spread virus idiot... changes opinion much... scientific analysis doctor? Lmao  Huh, odd. Annoyingly show me.
Hopefully one better: never said lol.  here. kept 4 year old home year, 2 year old refuse let daycare, baby June. I’d say 1 hopeful me, I’ll take 18 months ""Post-COVID lungs look worse type terrible smoker's lung we've ever seen. collapse. clot off. shortness breath lingers on... &amp; on... &amp; on.""

Edited add: point know could happen kids I'm risking 4 year old. big reason know lot affects kids large portion kids home since March. Well, want live zero risk, go ahead. drive car, partake things everyday probably riskier Covid. cannot continue hold children back something death rate flu them. Yes 2000, 1400 +600 already got explained over. low reading comprehension dont truly understand said. feel like came wrong conclusion there. Flu prevalence lower year, means far fewer carriers exist start spread infection. susceptibility catch flu change much course year, given populations getting annual flu vaccine getting vaccine, fewer initial spreaders take longer virus proliferate previous levels, therefore, fewer cases expected coming years historical trend, more. I'm finding out.

Funny thing lot criticize ""anti-vaxx"" people ones issue sending kids back school without COVID vaccine even available.

I get it. Heh. Never heard it. 

Also, looks like account older series. dangerous flu certain demographics, age 20 so.  math 6% Americans want though, hopefully enough meet demand may true, doesn’t explain Canada reopening quickly now. Manitoba, example, fewer 100 ICU beds entire province (of 1.2 million people). 4 x 0 = 0 10 patients. Zero victims. Weird thing full opened elementary schools here, middle high schools virtual (ok, mixed in-person select few, like special needs kids). able open elementary students now, 12+ able get vaccinated September, there's reason can't open fully. point aren’t “victim” medical condition. That’s vernacular. 6% wayyy less - think tested virus 92% effective symptomatic. 8% tested positive? I'm fully sure - tested everyone yeah would much due asymptomatic cases. percent people hospital vaccines low stand corrected, completely missed link actual study. However, still stand original statement study biased sufficient data.

The proper way see protests contribute increase cases take New York city, duplicate it, let BLM protests occur duplicate. several weeks protesting, compare duplicate original New York city. Eh back July multiple threads everyday many cases/deaths FL largest numbers per capita well basically every northeastern state (and still is). Big numbers grab attention. wish case. I'd like life return normal.  honestly thought people would get it. absurd earnest. absurd enough though apparently. knew. pump full steroids 10 days multiple experimental treatments unless suffering sniffles think EU lower hospital capacity US lot. US let COVID run rampant hospital capacity starts getting hit. seems like every time Europe there's another surge, immediately run hospital beds. wonder something Agree 1000% everything said years science I've never met one person wanted go Canada advance scientific career. I've seen people go US Europe US Asia. I've never ever seen one person go US Canada.

I think change. facilities. There's small pockets real culture scientific industry. Yeah, good stuff that's going help protect family covid. Yeah. son started continuing 6th grade remotely since last August. least older brother year adjust middle school make couple friends. tough. Wasn’t post saying said would enough July? thought thing read it, don’t understand KN95 surgical mask layered top it, wouldn’t even beneficial. didn’t clarify ‘why’ CDC article. Huh. Biden said wouldn’t enough vaccines cover everyone end summer? Welcome party, pal Mr pessimist here...it's 5 months Cuomo opposed attempt stifle travel New York, calling ""an attack states' rights."" course, best workable travel restrictions, overall COVID response best country. Biden wants make Hawaii's restrictions national mandate one thing, singling Florida nonsensical point. heard symptoms? Lol classic... bets long see one? 0 0? 6% people receiving two shots hospital, number got covid way higher 5% Please keep sharp satire up. Wear downvotes badge honor. Apparently people use term apparently usually followed complete fabrications mind. Truth! Well tax dollars paying it, like someone responsible spending money. case I'm fucking it.

Thank Joe! But..aren’t lot vaccines ordered coming American suppliers? value anecdotal evidence real life interactions value anecdotal evidence Reddit interactions. I'm anxious want kids vaccinated. know they'd survive well another semester remote learning fall. far we've two days two million. There's ways go that. Lol. ever heard anti vaxxers. true. mean technically Middle East part Asia people talking months ago ridiculed produced Pfizer US. Europe's supply produced BioNTech Europe. vaccine, different supply chain, US different manufacturing clauses contracts. scared would struggling get jabs.

According a new study by researchers University Oxford, Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine provides strong enough immune system response protect new variants coronavirus found UK South Africa, The Guardian reports.
The study, yet peer reviewed, mixed informative results. antibodies received first shot vaccine unable neutralize deadly South African variant known B.1.351, group’s T-cells — type white blood cells play central role immune system — effective known variants.
The antibodies group were, however, able fend highly transmissible UK variant, otherwise known B117, well original strain, moderately well.
While antibodies T-cells play important roles immune system, antibodies able fight pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 virus by attaching outside of pathogens. T-cells sense destroy pathogens inside infected cells lately become subject an increasing number studies involving coronavirus.

“It may necessarily protect infection, it’s likely first dose make much easier immune system make good response next time around,” William James, professor virology University Oxford co-authored Pfizer study, told The Guardian.
“We think second dose produces good strong antibody response, cells already there, ready react,” James explained.
Second doses, also commonly known booster shots, able greatly increase generation antibodies, suggesting may play important role fight coronavirus previously thought.
“In 90 percent cases, antibodies people generating second dose sort level neutralises virus would expect protect infection,” James told The Guardian. “We’re pretty confident they’ll protected infection South African strain Kent strain, well [original] strain virus.”

The news comes days COVID-19 vaccine manufactured University Oxford pharmaceutical AstraZeneca was found ineffective against South African variant. South Africa stopped planned rollout of vaccine Sunday result.
In words, scientists still working night day understand new variants — weapons them.

MORE VARIANTS: DEADLY UK COVID VARIANT DOMINATE US MARCH, EXPERTS SAY goes without saying Canada lockdown happy US, Ontario Manitoba reopening next couple weeks despite case numbers well wave 1 peaks, Quebec holdout. Even Quebec allows non-essential retail, outdoor recreation, museums open. 

I’m saying that’s bad thing. think it’s good thing, we’re well past due reopen.

What can’t understand Europe pro-lockdown. Quebec’s lockdown far harshest Canada. Meanwhile, France getting roasted soft lockdown equally restrictive Quebec’s plus earlier curfew (6 PM vs 8:30). UK talks extending lockdown month despite huge chunk vulnerable population vaccinated. Ireland extended 6 weeks. Germany 4. they’re significantly strict anything we’ve seen NA. 

So really, gives? EU lockdown happy right now? anyone says vaccines, Canada pretty much spot vaccines EU. didn’t say year btw They’ve actually vaccinating population awesome! people sick, stay home. Asian mask culture good thing. thing person wears mask precaution grocery shopping kid's teacher's second cousin got sick. courtesy people they're symptomatically sick (think like sweating, coughing, sneezing) frowned upon take sick day there. Trying adopt Japanese mask culture distracts us fact need mandatory paid sick time workers. article: ""This means nationwide restrictions, well lockdown three districts comes force Friday, enforceable date."" 


Here daily statistics Czech Republic: Hey someone exact situation wanted say I’m happy made best choice mental health, healthy mama important baby’s well choose feed ❤️ felt guilty formula made life 100 times better made 100 times easier enjoy bond boy. That'd need wait while, though. I'd rather J&amp;J today Moderna July. Odd, that’s manufacturer’s documentation states. Money talks!

Never thought I'd say thank Federal Government! documented vaccines induced guillain-barré paper subject. quote I'd like consider abstract, ""More recent information suggested occurrence GBS currently used influenza vaccines rare. GBS involves genetic environmental factors, may triggered infections vaccinations, predisposition predicted analyzing factors.""

The scientific consensus without risk factors, pretty negligible. Vaccinations nature create sort unseen long-term complications. fact undermined data. 

Here's [a CDC issue, ""Studies suggest likely person get GBS getting flu vaccination. important keep mind severe illness death associated flu, getting vaccinated best way prevent flu infection complications."" lower bar looking former US president. better that. non-issue! mean, think right school starting regardless, lot parents still care risk, even lower. Misc c long term risks fully know classmates unvaccinated there's good chance they'd get it. essentially eliminated flu mask wearing Covid still running rampant around world. many people complain many people aren’t wearing masks yet managed eliminate flu. Doesn’t seem weird anyone? Yes, 600m doses Moderna Pfizer account 300m vaccinations. There's another deal J&amp;J 100 million doses.  usually talking point actual cries help. line people women advancing careers care much kids. Misogynistic busy bodies. 

Actual cries help... well... would sent help organizations, anti lockdown protests. vitro vivo. biological correlates disease protection yet firmly established here. Probably not. rarely given someone company. 99% people universities. East lol..... probable get swepted first round. hey, live NYC hope make it. Israel started trouble getting people door hit 40% population (i think, someone please correct me). Either people want apathetic getting it, unless super easy. 

I feeling US similar. around 11% 1+ doses. Long way go till 40%. TONS people life chomping bit get shot availability soon. Hopefully states notice dip demand, open next phase pretty quick. estimate May ish demand dropping off. Also depends J J.

But lot happen May public perception-wise. Demand probably go up, ease access. demand going way 70-80%? agree that's stretch. bummer. Right? problem getting vaccine myself, something sit right young child giving newer vaccine.

I would think twice, maybe read many books? amazes I'm still seeing people, year later, claiming covid dangerous flu.

That's like surrounding brain 5-mile thick wall selective ignorance. Right. true. add answer Sputnik; use 2P/stabilized spike either LMAO way “eliminate flu season” every single person wearing masks public (which won’t happen) close schools colleges mandate social distancing flu seasons 


Is guys want? hope San Francisco outlier 699 overdose deaths compared 243 covid deaths Nah, enough unnecessary Ys. Itll like varyiynt something. obvious they're saying prevent people taking mask day one getting vaccine immunity developed, avoid people lying vaccinated get wearing mask.

Another reason even vaccinated people virus seems able replicate respirational tract, seem spread virus, too, although lower amounts it. corrected. Eh idk think ill wait long while. Ive hears quite older folks dying adverse reactions. Wonder.cdc.gov Safety mean lot things. it’s different many people. Sending kids school unvaccinated would stupid decision since one immunocompromised. stated several places thread, they’re also middle/high school aged involved in/agree decision. 

What’s best family may best peoples families. That’s don’t see telling people they’re making “a really stupid decision” sending kids school. It’s someone Reddit’s place, idea background situation, tell parent right decision make.

Very unbecoming immature. Keep seething Lost 16kg 32 pounds 9 days hospital covid causes overweight people lose lot weight hospital...especially food give you.

My family kept distance commented much weight lost still mention month leaving hospital.....i cannot seem gain weight still losing albeit little ever week. they? reddit? I'm American liberal moderate reddit still ridiculous much everything gets blamed conservatives. redditors Canadians, they'd overwhelmingly NDP certainly let conservatives Republicans slide *shit*. Even petty shit, make sure criticize for. type petty shit, they'll let Democrats NDPers get away day.

Are reading website am? People shitting Florida purely political reasons—it’s reddish state gone typical narrative/protocol ok compared rest country. feels completely political think it’s gonna backfire. stop suggesting it. Please see comment explain (I slightly date info, made followup comment explain). research ""breastmilk covid"" find PLENTY research topic. breaks mother's exposure covid passes antibodies breastmilk transmission mother baby bordering 0. thing antibodies passed vaccine. even consider reading first sentence article commenting? Um, getting vaccinated making sure kids got one every year. You’re right, life must go on. Getting everyone vaccinated straight line goal. 

I love anti-vax Rhodes Scholars love say shit like “LiVe LiFe FeAr” survival instinct wanting kid catch deadly virus something ashamed of. You’re fucking joke. same, working home homeschooling youngest virtual school older kiddos. many unknowns. I’m happy hear kids okay, worth risk. I’m good. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* current vaccine rollout slow, September extremely efficient. went get covid tested today one drive-up walk-in sites state (Tennessee) took less 5 minutes get tested. waiting times results still comically long tho 2 4 days, needs dropped digress. point vaccines September able handle waves youngin's 5 6 million day. I’m calm, I’m anti vaccinations rushed one. say? Oh thank God! can't vacinate kids hidden dangers?

Nobody 18 trials initially. 12-18 year olds trials Pfizer Moderna months going younger soon Good point, Chinese vaccines seem like could global workhorses. reason think Chinese selling snake oil case (they giving people), don’t see whole lot transparency either. interesting see plays out. ever 3rd world country? No, asking hours research citations time tonight. reason vaccines need 2-3 months safety data declared safe. Either conditions happen don't. lie dormant years. Feline coronavirus does. Doesn’t make much sense either. easily got 50 million dipshits won’t take another 50-100M kids hasn’t approved for. add already bought sounds like overkill. Obama still gets stories every often. President US, American media gonna pay attention him. Awesome. 

I want vaccinated. 

She’ll happy get single shot one, she’ll get whatever necessary. hates shots, knows it’s right. 11 days ago said constrained 10M doses week that's going going forward next 3 months. already proven wrong. supply fixed. Pfizer Moderna increasing production. Honestly? got President therefore getting literal best medical treatment? would've died. He's got comorbidities. Gotcha. Transmission decreased guaranteed null.

Sorry. Words hard. problem actions consequences. craziness, plan executing it! it’s dumb way phrase spook people. You’d never say victim flu victim diabetes Darwin. Every day thousands people dead hundreds $billions wasted. Wow, would mean threshold herd immunity? 90% population? Welp... think Canada ever claimed best health care world. Universal health care wonderful thing, without problems, many Canadians fully aware of. We’re gonna need quadruple mask now! Even reduce transmission, still think everyone get vaccinated. important distinction understood. vaccine make virus magically go away. Even vaccinated, still take precautions, still carry virus pass others. least, current understanding - somebody feel free correct I'm wrong. (Don't downvote asking legitimate question.) need July ones even? I'm curious planning getting approved teenagers July. roughly 255 million adults United States currently approved get vaccine, would amazed even see 80% people actually getting vaccine. 80% 204 million, might reflect Fauci stating people able get one want late April so. Or, could drive, prevent deaths using safety measures (seatbelts, airbags, speed limits, stop signs).

Vaccines safety measures. Let's say typically get 30% population immunized flu vaccines. imagine carnage roads 30% people stopped red lights? kind depends. think n95 known best practice one's skin professionally fitted air coming going mask. If, hospital, known covid positive setting example, surgical mask n95, breathing bottom mask around perimeter n95. Thus, filtering air well could potentially.

With surgical/cloth mask n95, tightening seal, necessarily filtering better n95, properly sealed first place. work vaccine clinic currently Moderna anyone 18 Pfizer 16. Yea I’m way saying wouldn’t rather universal healthcare.100% would. reddit acts like every single American 100k debt stubbed toe That’s I’m saying. Every knew whole tome reduce transmission, wasn’t clear, still isn’t clear, much. I'm sorry, guy. understand rough, wish none us position. Godspeed Right. That’s exactly I’m saying. Require things like public school. 

But saying don’t want get Covid vaccine kid vaccinated you’re afraid government pretty tin-hatty Minnesota, minutes 🙁 unless thus second variant coming Brazil? always disingenuous use total number cases deaths measure response. 

Rhode Island Oregon 2,274 2,056 deaths, respectively, they're 5th 47th US deaths per capita.

New Jersey Florida 22,329 28,384 deaths, respectively, 1st 26th deaths per capita. Better quicker younger that. toddler twins chronic lung disease hard lockdown vaccinated. Glad lost respect. doubt much respect profession begin with. I've teaching person since August, save self-righteous indignation. feel need wear kn95 everytime go McDonald's drive though. I'm made money. Still gotten Covid I'm probably best do. Biden getting shit done.

Donnie, he’s *really* making look like asshole. went take look vaccination site state get feel it. Might write script request appointment get closer general availability deadline. Ah yes, GDP way judge countries level development. Remove top 1% Americans let’s talk development. mean closest I’ve knowingly virus it’s kind freaky that’s assuring least, thank you. 

I’m considering wiping everything desk go back room also taking bedsheets well. I’ve waiting it’s 3 hours since roommate left quarantine virus falls air too

Edit: grammar true. Canadian media fawns Trudeau. world watches Trump getting impeached twice don’t realize Trudeau convicted twice government ethics violations mention many scandals behaviour towards women (he sexually assaulted female reporter said people interpret events differently) fired indigenous female attorney general refused lie. Canada keeps voting in. homies hate UK variant. misspelled Reddit media though? That’s said. takes one mutation Airlines commonsense measures would make american people much greater trust flying. You’re fucking nuts. committed. Jesus. hope you’re felon lost right vote Why?  300mil count includes J&amp;J. Wait, get scheduled 70,200 doses week? Duh. wish matters base, nothing Biden change mind cult. Ever since Biden got office, seems vaccinations ramped quickly. fucking hate Trump much - intentionally trying get Americans vaccinated. heck fix massive social/political divide states I’ll **thrilled** get thing June. I’m afraid won’t be, time also feel hopeful it. seems way. don’t think it’s terrible idea recommend (not mandate) masks you’re sick cold flu store. school closures. way. part said “legal fiction”? Please tell me. can't let people developed countries. ban literally everyone NZ style. sustainable long term, even variants would eventually get in.

The cost potential second pandemic far bigger cost shots. Here’s bro 💩 Yes, don’t know clinical trial. Guess injecting people monitoring reaction tracking monitor progress/health random things fun. think America 0 COVID infrastructure, see Canada Trudeau. Americans vaccinating population rate 3x even Trump office. current government bad ? guy narcissistic personality disorder. think people really get trump mentally ill, hyperbolic sense literal clinical sense. compulsively admit wrong anything. Even smallest inconsequential things. reason read title “Pizza vaccine found give strong immune response new Covid variants”

lol 1. Lower median age
2. Vast under-reporting deaths

Can give one reason racist one ? Look post history. I'd take anything idiot says metric fuck ton salt. tipped ""California California"" bullshit. know I’ll lose sense smell taste day Thanksgiving. know it. look forward Thanksgiving every year. Completely anecdotal, know 5 people Brazil right covid, got Manaus. Three doctors treated around covid patients whole time. 4 5 covid first time. 1 doctors also already vaccinated think days, enough make difference. Maybe they're confident safety vaccine begin with, since uses traditional inactivated virus method. mention anti-vaxxers Yes many obeying safe driving laws - driving intoxicated, texting driving, speeding, etc. duped believing that? Never heard phrase before. newspaper headline question reliably answered ""No"". He’s dead?! clueless believe that. LMAO. Well, care. So, can't really relate unthoughtful generalization. part I'm suppose say...

""Well, Boomers care planet younger generations trying tackle issues burdened onto us!""

I mean... constructive way travel path you? basing entire argument, actions, legal fictions, ignoring significant positive clinical data around world, ignoring global pandemic. foolish get caught legal terms evidence clear.

Even years ago, would paid attention emergency use authorizations global pandemic overwhelming evidence successful vaccine, now. Thanks. read good link someone else posted. heard update. Thats great news. It’s bad. choice go mRNA. Either specific knowledge Aztec culture ability pull guesses thin air pretty impressive. Lol. Cars literally killed children state covid. Stop fear mongering. 8 new variants guaranteed kill everyone love.

YOU WON’T BELIEVE NUMBER FIVE! isolation immunity.

The virus introduced New Zealand early US Europe. gave big head start, could see quickly things could potentially spiral control take measures stop happening country. New Zealand multiple introductions virus substantial community spread December 2019, January 2020 etc, things would gone differently.

It also much easier simply shut borders foreigners. hardly viable strategy places like Europe. cOuLD ProOF 


well starters evidence long lasting damage they're damaged early, still damaged, could/would evidence. 

Does exist? What? NYT. Lottery? What, first I'm hearing this. true, absolutely acceptable. High risk (diabetics, obese, etc), regardless age next. need fix distribution, customer base. get tons essential workers sick people able get vaccine right healthy people they're taking parents grandparents. willing take before, that's bad. elderly willing go before, why's that?

Highly geography dependent. huge number daily available appointments SF area qualified. sense medical worker wants already. California too. covid name disease? so... I'm sorry see point. Yes still patients headline states specific number people. said 4 664 patients fully vaccinated, would incorrect since plenty patients die. 

Look way 10 people admitted hospital. One dies. Would one patient 10 patients? already lying pretend description summer 2021 anything remotely close ""normal."" right, actually. Toci goddess So, including J&amp;J? Moderna/Pfizer? Oh man, would great.  best healthcare system world afford it.

Problem many can't. Incubation Convalescence moron?   Yall shit Florida much, numbers terms infections death per capita middle pack little zero restrictions.

I admit data veracity problems state's projections self-reported infection rate. However, even take pessimistic data set listed CDC collected independent source, still outside top 10 every single critical category per state.

That's pretty amazing considering literally almost ZERO restrictions versus big states lot restrictions like California New York hit hard. Maybe, think majority students able see friends. students US havent seen friends person since March... scary though. waitangi day basically groups people distancing masks, completely normal jealous lol. actually state Bavaria, Germany general ""medical mask"", meaning surgical mask FFP2/N95/KN95 mask.

Anyway since months FFP2/N95/KN95 available euros online, recently often 1-2 € supermarkes. really prefer going shopping many people wear masks tighly, mask wearing hardly protects aerosol transmission. prefer driving car public transport. No. wanted work. wanted giving shots fast possible, right? 


If closing due shortages, we'd getting scary news stories rollout mess bunch unused vaccines. think agree merely surviving infection whole story. step brother Covid months ago still right. long term implications well known. Yeah. Also:

🥅➡️➡️➡️🥅 So, forever? Got it. Anecdotal evidence: somehow coworker managed that, dragged work set coughing day. couple days later felt describe, others sat room us. knew Fauci referring said “we’ll semblance normal return summer”. mRNA vaccines though low chance success. However data finally came showed mRNA vaccines actually best ones.

So think investment producing mRNA vaccines beforehand people probably reluctant go full force 

The US bet heavily AZ turned get great many reasons even approved US. may spent lot money AZ vaccine never see light day call America ""somehow invalid""? say less country, literally said bigger one, therefore rather comparing EU. Canada wanted 6 million vaccines February, ordered delivered February, March 31st. know helps, reported 29 reactions 1.9 million doses administered, rate 11.1 per 1 million doses, everyone reactions fine. former EMS worker, I’d like see people wearing masks flu season every year,

I plan this, partly piss anti-maskers. getting sick often protecting vulnerable people course, nice bonus. Wow that's gigantic drop. Though follows europe's drop aswell. believe anything coming israel right Netenyaho desperate. easier transport vaccinates 1 big site vs 1000 little ones worried necessarily news concerning vaccine shortages mass vaccination sites closed California? Bloomberg updated again.

48 million doses administered. 2 million happening past day.

Looks like hitting 50 million tomorrow(huge milestone).

And weekly average 1,621,693 doses per day.  want back statements actual proof. know sub well hence request substantiate claims. goverment lol. id rather specialists/scientists make declarations random idiots ""society"" Mornings better days.  UK variant, B117 lineage Well given lot early manufactiored vaccines country, going country ). comes early investments , country take risks since worst case invested companies infrastructure. Pfizer american company. stayes there, way smaller Biontech company hast build manufactioring europe first.

The 2nd point Trump made early clear almost early one produce vaccines ( later december sign order so)will stay US . country already unattractive foreign staates invest ( high costs) ,becomes even unattractive (even expensive late arrival vaccines). Thanks fact India lacks infrastructure producing mNRA vaccines , country/block big three vaccine producers EU. everyone wanted early many mNRA vaccine bet Pfizer manufactiored vaccines EU ( like Israel UK). fact comes EU late investing/protecting manufactioring (thanks long negotiations Pfizer/Biontech) , around one third manufactiored Pfizer/Biontech vaccines stay Europe.

So EU gets fucked early inaction , america first policies trump unlucky market dynamics. Absolute insanity. goal always protect vulnerable. registered back January. Whenever call me, I’ll going, city I’m SUPER slow, probably won’t get later spring XD Yeah. pandemic started bought 100 pounds rice beans. concerned food processing facilities would get shut Covid grocery stores would empty. That’s enough rice beans feed wife, daughter, 2 dogs month. 

It’s kind good emergency plan. However, going start eating goes bad. Happy news hopefully it’ll give time figure whole scheduling/appointments mess. I’m struggling get appts parents phase 1 refresh like every hour still nothing Really? I've heard opposite. Standard disposable masks fit me, personally (too big). I've making cloth masks custom sized fit someone's face perfectly, made breathable 100% cotton. husband prefers disposables. Plus better environment. see old masks road ground time.

As long wearing something, that's really matters. Truly. Masks=good. safety isnt variable considering. think commenter trying prevent making really stupid decision. ... add I'm afraid put guinea pig. I'm currently trial Novavax. Yeah also passed ton doses. aztec god. Probably. wild question. looking excuse anti-vax. I've read total mRNA doses 600 million delivered June/July.

That's equivalent 300 million complete vaccinations.

And means US complete entire vaccination using mRNA vaccines. yup definitely happen places.it’s shame, poor kids going seriously behind missing full year person instruction key time education. That's assumption. Vaccine manufacturers may meet target, Canada says will, currently delay. Good point. understand want take gaurenteed sickness possible life altering effects rather slight chance unknown unpredicted side effect. bad everyone smart you. suggest happen out? Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* VAERS - Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System would beg differ. real data something would find credible, would now? risks MIS-C around wonder uptick came parents present kids realizing something wrong. 

Not saying pandemic doesn’t negatively affect mental health, totally does. That's objectively false statement. Here's quote actual study:

""Our data protests collected May 25, 2020, day George Floyd killed, July 7, 2020 315 U.S. cities municipal populations estimated 100,000 2019 (U.S. Census Bureau 2019). Searches protests carried Center

Oh yeah, totally forgot mention bullshit call ""right work""

America fuck yeah? aren’t offering. I’m immunosuppressed high risk, age putting public. It’ll take months get worked out, people still getting shots September, may need booster round then. Yep. know supply going increase. tells triple supply still going running short good getting injected. THANK YOU. discussion friend last night. reinfections common, we'd seeing clear evidence already, year pandemic. fact really haven't, barring unusual iffy cases, actually quite reassuring.

Also, WTF Southern Maryland Chronicle? I'm going limb saying JAMA not. Yeah that's meant. 56 peoples serious condition surely alot infected asymptomatic. maybe efficacy slightly lower? new variants  rest easy kids protected too.

What missing here? Kids shrugs Covid like nothing already. warrants amount concern media fear-mongering US complete entire vaccine strategy using mRNA! Man, wish. longer drink like could college. Plus, knew college know now.... Anywho, good one! really good (relative national size), zero long term investment industries. two patients equals USA. Got it.

You reason concerned, going chronic ""long covid"" -- autoimmune reactions virus similar ME/CFS. there's still nonzero chance severe COVID MIS-C kids (and associated possibility chronic organ damage), vaccines cause.

But kids get virus fine ~3 months later okay rest lives. Omg guy dooming glooming longhaul effects trying convince everyone terrified (even people reasonably pointed otherwise)?

Go away, man! entire comment complete non-sequitur. literally cant piece together youre trying say.

kids vaccinated vaccines approved. lack approvals prevent kids going school person. dont know works places hospital got first dose made appointment second way out. wouldnt matter someone appointment someone brought end day doses left.. leave room appointment second dose. Stop talking norm, normal, etc. It’s boring. know least local health department asking people delay vaccination infected less 90 days ago. aren’t enough shots everyone wants one...if you’ve got good chance immune would bro move let someone else get shot first. mean couldn’t say Kennedy Congress type source that? Still schedule March 31st. delay. Would say victim stomach ache victim cancer? I’ve never heard word choice medical condition. None kids, 'worse smokers lungs', literally looked like lungs pneumonia. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stop spreading bad information. could say college kid done it. Brevity such. India vaccinating whole world rich countries order need export restrictions.

PM Modi needs recognizer honoured generosity. earliest headline would suggest would May, no, March lol crazy happens President spend days golfing, tweeting, eating McDonald's watching Fox News day Good luck that.

Once high-risk people vaccinated, vaccine made available society large, hospitalization/death counts low, restrictions lifted. can't force entire countries shelter place years barring immediate crisis situation.

And say someone supported tougher lockdowns we've actually seen.

Covid going away, certain point get normal lives. want vaccines we've got decent slack public health systems, time.

At point, refuse vaccine, risk you. Trudeau naive gullible, petulant self absorbed. he's blessed good looks, political family bloodline, knows look good camera. He's left wing version trump, agreeable personality cult self aggrandizement pervade orbit. *only* thing he's managed, 5 years, decriminalize marijuana. one too, sorry hear Put microchip supplements make millions it! mean anything without also covid infections/deaths. example Australia New Zealand zero still started vaccinations yet. hardly covid cases. wish easy. suspicion vast majority vaccine refusers refusing intelligent rejection risks associated new vaccine methodologies, instead rumors, fear mongers, people hold strong opinions things choose remain ignorant about.

If bothered understand, I'd lot respect them. think excellent take. groups vaccinated thus far primarily 65+ (aside first responders/front line) since make huge chunk hospitalizations makes sense. Freedum small short number lockdowns did?...../s thing worth looking seven day rolling average. day-to-day changes dominated reporting noise. trend - find angle come best metrics boast it. Like constantly talking recovery rate.

And pro-govt followers blindly follow it.

In reality, vaccination rate peaked Jan 28th 570k 350k since. Instead ramping up, gone down. many differences efficacy trials pointless try figure one better.

They work. Pfizer *might* slightly effective, appear work *faster*, vaccine get (or, um, next months) still faster vaccine can't get while).  Sinovac inactivated virus, ""traditional"" method making vaccines. Thank you- know what's permanent long lasting **for sure** yet, thus caution. can't quite say anything yet maybe look happens case viruses. far deaths populated countries longer wait, probably better honestly. First dose enough short term Really flu deaths year? Basically, April earliest going predictions. seems like gaffe. I'm saying someone despises Trump everything stands for:

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* worry kids already many issues asthma kids well. Anything affects respiratory system seems like gamble. understand parents nervous. reach point vaccines available general public long enough people want fully immunized (booster applicable + waiting period), *and* uptake decently high, *and* deaths hospitalizations consistently low, *and* mask mandates still gone away... point, sensible thing stop following them. whole pandemic feels like eternity likely experimented arrived Wuhan got out. would open windows can,  eye issues chicken pox eyeballs. Kids scratch eyes they're itchy over, knew. I'm sorry got shingles, heard insanely painful I'm sorry effects line. You’ve never helicoptered hospital cause runny nose? course not. importing Kent variant. Fair. Here’s direct quote. 

“We'll see next week two government administration takes topic up. know easy, think lives risk here, know can't make high priority.” Trump's find shame sickness. nice someone wrote it. wait...so good? Damn, wasn’t factoring much contagious thing is.

But widespread vaccination cut right? US's healthcare system joke terms access, co-pay, etc. mean Canada's issues well.

But post specific part healthcare, taht Pharma industry, even specialiazed, vaccine manufacturing, something Canada huge capacity relied globalization seen facilities close.

And horse race.  Canada tail end pretty brutal supply disruption #1 vaccine relying on. supply disruption ends week Canada back vaccinating decent clip (not U.S.'s, that's fine, good US). guess things slowing countries Here's results recent study JNJ South African clinical study vaccine South Africa, part international trials, showed 57% effective preventing moderate severe COVID-19 test conducted variant dominant. provides even better protection severe disease, 85% efficacy 28 days.

So 85% protection severe cases, good Pfizer Moderna, still pretty know many trials conducted none western countries like Chile example. election stolen south rise right ??? LOL No, doesn't. say would implement extension mask mandate federal property, say would try push states extend mandates. FWIW wife Pfizer felt little crappy dose 2, anything severe. Like gotten shot day would thought felt crappy bad night sleep something. Next morning good go work problem. best friend way -- couple coworkers though fevers, took Tylenol, fine. all, worst case think looking crappy 24-36 hours nothing worse. shameful buy goods services us ? 

Your highest living standard built natives blood land grabing selling natural resources . easy feel entitled like oil rich shieks money earned without effort . get bunch together, pass virus around mutates point vaccine relevant more, pass general population, we're super fucked. He’s hero best could. federal response joke, zero leader ship coming end things. sucks. nurse, would think she'd compassionate. character flaw get sick. medical advice, doctor, doctor. medical concerns wish seek medical advice medical opinion, please speak qualified licensed medical provider area.

I felt pretty similar first dose, maybe slightly worse. First dose, felt like got punched arm fatigued next day. Second dose, mild moderate arm pain fatigue, mild headache/feverishness/muscle aches. Cleared within like 24-36 hours part, completely normal 48 hours status post second dose. understand Biden **cannot** mandate mask-wearing except federal property, right? Well fair, 9,000 nursing home patients plus anyone else hospital COVID. remove latter, huge issue. told ""you hospital beds next week"" can't really let people stay hospital they're contagious. That's point hospital. They'd stay hospital going die otherwise. Since hospital deemed ""healthy enough brave home"" go home. Home happens nursing home scenario. Russia communist. it’s little older October revolution. People underestimated Russia, especially citizens long time. percentage people gotten vaccine hospital? Hang there, everybody. wait.

To clear, information LA, knowingly saying, implying impacting California (regarding lottery system shortage)? makes lot sense, especially see California administered 13.39 doses people per 100 people Texas administered 12.79 doses per 100. 

Also Texas given shots 9.5% percent population California given shots 10.4%.  Los Angeles running supply meet distribution efforts mean we've hit hard cap. 

Ca received really low amount vaccine compared population expect first instance. need money. Also true... also depends many cases think it’s good did. need delays. going do? let people die need to. User name fucking check out.  Can't wait till get new variants state, county town. Spread fear! I've learned get sick *anything*, can't admit sister-in-law, nurse, I'll get earful irresponsible must been. many people died flu israel period time? would think 0, based past years. Ohio also seen variant emerge similarities b.1.1.7

Fuck... Yes, true.

But say sky blue, expect people start yelling crayon. Nothing says he's mandating either ""through next year"" ""year-round"". Good bad things :) Bodies definitely 0% effective own. vast majority survive virus develop immunity. anti-vaxxer. willingness take covid vaccine depend nation respect restrictions. close summer time eligible get vaccine. still asked wear masks, social distance, events continue canceled, sign going back normal, take vaccine. support ""new normal."" Show significant progress toward reopening, happily take vaccine. Continue current BS, see point. hmm...electric eels then? Freshwater dolphins protecting young? gill monster still somewhere?  something dangerous missionaries there. Shit happens said borders shouldn’t problem. you’re backtracking say closed? Get neo-nazi dogwhistling elsewhere gets half current level still highest level peak March April 2020. feel that?   Uh us want go Europe US due better Social systems. US bar Europe stop saying need go worse nation like US. American can't go Europe live work even illegally. work like that. Perhaps people say Nation US sucks healthcare response let's fix par Europe instead leave True already seeing drop cases vulnerable risk catch people vaccinated, april R0 driven way lower.     won’t BELIEVE many Israelis got sick Covid Vaccine! soon open, virus comes back in. Federally guided gradual reopening absolute bullshit. soon California hit elusive orange tier cases went shut down. 


And information, saying bankrupting country creating generations poverty homelessness vanquishing tens millions years life expectancy appropriate reaction Covid measures taken little nothing save anyone’s life covid denial. It’s fact. people understanding getting zero covid cases naive dangerous fantasy. live British Columbia. new restrictions since November 19, 2020. 7 day average new cases around 680. 85 days, 7 day average ~440, restrictions extended indefinitely. Schools open since September. entire government prison. Haha idea get vaccinated leave masks home right? Hopefully soon. need start getting shots arms fast. Palestinians area? mean surface yes, expel people homeland ban descendents citizens deny care uh... Well pretty fucked Israel Hopefully many places still appointment-based turn, show stand line. common sense tolerated here, sir.   burden responsibility northern world mass organize provide data vaccine virus world without patent monopolies, delay efforts required vaccinate world. wealthy nations afford this, serve capital interests.  Dont worry. Israel well. vaccinated 50% population felt people stopped rushing vaccinate. Less less come every day. good all. definitely want go back normal know many people want I'm afraid prevent good. first shot reaction, likely covid back afaik.

my first pfizer shot effects whatsoever, little anxious second one tuesday..  No. things like holding government, leaders corporations accountable, demanding better preparedness transparency outbreaks. Developing better media culture. Respecting environment. kind thing Vaccination nationalism doesn’t help WORLD! surprised horrific things people wish others. 2 people downvoted need check back insane asylum. precisely principle “social capital”, pretty much governs modern society. Thank you, quite informative text. Honestly vaccines great develop better treatments end world lack sense humor subreddit tiring. guys nothing short despicable. bit sarcasm expense least deserve. Unless really think original poster intended shocked every 10 seconds rest lives? know point is? borders stay closed year least - everyone. vaccinations. Using napkin math,

You must spilled napkin. talking zero point energy  Good hear!! English first language? bet never governors hinting keeping restrictions disease eradicated. irrational part convinced mask mandates go away  many died? many hospitalized? agree you, don’t think there’s reason either. Basically I’m saying they’re required, they’re required, matter stupid find there’s much do. Yep, we’re island nation ports entry, like them. 🤦‍♂️ Lol they’re *made* wash hands? ever high school bathroom before? ... store. propose opening borders USA? Without covid tests? say open borders shouldn’t problem. Mexico shouldn’t bringing covid in, neither USA right? Straw man lmao. 

Whatever. entire post history insane covid denial subs. conversation. spew point view debunked every person career public health. course vaccine idiots going come back say ""SEE, LOOK NICE NORMAL!"" Completely forgetting fact reason downturns cases deaths states cities implementing restrictions complete absence federal leadership. fact point Europe go back lockdown multiple times, failing mention incredible success Spring 2019 containing outbreaks telling. let brake pretended everything fine, came roaring back tens thousands people died. That's argument shutdowns lmfao

The answer never permanent lockdown. vaccine developed two days genome Covid19 sequenced. simply wait approval distribution, minimize loss life carefully considered FEDERALLY GUIDED curtailment public facing business combined stimulus programs. Instead entire crowd went way contrarian advice smartest public health minds human history, literally. Yeah. that's perfect example ""good enough"" approach concerned about. 

Rather even wait extra days full efficacy, much less information. perfectly fine. saying everyone decide exact time it, rather makes comfortable.

My point simply saying sit around waiting government tell safe again, rather make personal judgement. ready severely would react mine. 

I driven. Within 45 minutes required wait got light headed, almost passed out. 

I luckily gastrointestinal issues, ass 2 days. 

Scheduling second round Friday, clearing schedule whole weekend.  necessarily. new. immune systems react way time encounter it. Furthermore, treatments found, able manage better, mitigating long term effects.

Even flu cause longterm complications. see much learned treat better. Pre exposure helped bodies fight off, vaccine powerful tool least prep immune systems coming flu season Believe not, shortly posted able get husband appointment- he’s one high risk he’s one worried about. It’s 25 miles house he’ll take day work whatever, he’s getting it! happy! Huh? EU's Q2 commitments Pfizer seems increased past month. ROFL. serious, Clark? fudged shit data forced people homes upon penalty death.  going turn full karen

Sounds right. “Doesnt happen must false” People keep saying without realizing reopened last year. We're lockdown lol This. anyone plan future? precedent set cycle covid over. standard next bird flu, swine flu etc. Michael? it? Great article. Given everyone take vaccine, virus continue evolve, likely always danger COVID. can't hold lives forever. Life spent trying avoid risk living. What's even worse French vaccinating Germans Americans vaccinating Mexicans, basically Hitlers.

On top Palestinians denied Israeli offers vaccine, guess Palestinians want Palestinians die Israelis do, nothing new. Like friends gonna breed. Need testing advice. found me, fiancé, brother, two brothers sister law super bowl part somebody tested positive today. weren’t wearing masks much distancing. I’m going try get tested ASAP. test negative get tested see maybe first false negative. many days exposure say it’s likely didn’t catch covid. Secondly, fiancé sister law vaccinated week. possible vaccination cause false positive? Lastly, turns test positive terms getting second vaccination? don’t even know decipher I'll Dr Pepper please. I’d ok wearing mask end year means start lifting restrictions get economy back track. 

People scared we’ve dealing year there’s concrete info restrictions start lifted. ""Lmao"" casually discussing literal torture. course are. disgusting even allowed near people spread stupidity.  read studies last months opposed looking sensationalist media headlines find shocking news response police arresting woman staging masked socially distanced anti lockdown protest? source pride you? fully vaccinated guy (Israel) murdered wife know damn well it’s already circulating cause killer’s rage. Un fucking believable still agree everything saying. almost definitely related Canada approving change 5 doses 6 doses per Pfizer vial (as US EU already January).  good news Pfizer is't cutting back vials 2nd quarter due (thus leading Canada getting doses, paper). amount vaccines coming Pfizer Moderna Q2 revised 23 million 20 million.

Also news Presser: Canada purchased another 4 million doses Moderna, full order Moderna Pfizer supplied end September todal 84 Million. Enough vaccinate every single Canadian 2 vaccines alone.  

Add AstraZeneca, Johnson Johnson, Novavax mix.... “It’s don’t trust you, don’t trust you, also lazy find myself”

Some usernames deleted yeah, enjoy. Plenty people letting kids go school vaccinated, per article year now.  vaccine offer protection get already infected? thought infection would already trigger immune response without vaccine. evidence happens? live Australia - imbecile. Here's another messed-up COVID-19 story: work hospital direct patient contact, sitting yards away vaccination clinic, yet give vaccination I'm direct employee.

I drive 120 miles roundtrip get vaccination another hospital. brag anything live life diseases bring people back dead deaths negative world always like that, covid spreading mutating people deal that. rhinovirus mutated became virulent. J&amp;J, Novavax, AZ, etc. submitted review! We're way. Intentional not, taboo point huge portion deaths nursing homes. begs question: eager bring next generations poverty civil unrest, could probably save lot lives imposing restrictions measures onto nursing homes entire country? miss normal hope comes back vaccine widely available. concerned many people want return normal though may prevent us going back normal life state saying available everyone except kids 16 June. It’s picked speed significantly last weeks, too. places outdoor mandates, pretty mental. get outdoor close quarters minutes. Mandating circumstances overkill. grandma almost died every time got cold vulnerable. never thought blaming society living life passing colds around. vulnerable always risk dying. Social interactions come risk. ways always even covid long gone. represents roughly 3% total country's population. Vaccination started exactly 2 weeks ago, daily vaccination rollout recently around 150-200k doses. Active cases stand 11250 February 12th Evangelical christianity lethal virus... Hang second. again, every time someone old fragile dies covid, gets tear jerking news article, posted gets thousands upvotes despite visibly typical case.

But unnaceptable? really image child family worried want anything shows lockdowns bad light published? US Centers Disease Control Prevention Friday released guidelines reopening schools, including ""five key mitigation strategies"" returning in-person school safely. cases high locality

did set threshold ""high"" here? cases already dropping like rock accelerate J&amp;J rolling out. they'll well unsafe thresholds time get next academic year starting i'm saying is, zipcode 1-3 infections per day mid-October... that, increased significantly (30 per day) dropped 10 per day still much higher March April. graphs bear out. addition variant circulating much infectious anyone thinking woods sorely mistaken. risk low. concern much. might know this, us going work dealing customers every single day since pandemic started. doubt die lunch coworkers. Hoping Aftershock Sacramento October ok. I've never heard injection called ""poke"". last time checked UK still Europe

Que? hovering around 70 75% mask compliance worst winter surge

even he's serious it, he's gonna able enforce Got two days ago. dizzy night sore arm thats it. Deez nuts CDC say whatever restrictions dropped. I'm willing chalk remembering things exaggerated way really was, easy seeing things already seem extreme (like vaccination schools thing linked to).  That's normal human thing happens everybody. worries, nice day. Yet taxpayers still forced build fund stadiums teams housing food crisis local communities. good news! lengths people go admit lockdown harmful wrong. Helmets would reduce peripheral vision lot, need drive properly. much problem BLIS, ""you rely technology drive safely"" :p Portland. yeah, SF looks like even another level. really, can’t mutate well flu. reason it’s able mutate much thus far it’s widespread set records six straight years seven eight, eighth eight years anomalous. question went 2019 effects lowered expected 2020 absent Covid.

For US, see clearer information, looks like deaths bottomed peak March 2019. gradual, accelerating increase Covid.  Whatever caused decrease seems overcome end 2019. San Francisco? wonder using reddit sell fake vaccines! us forever, like many formerly scary viruses/bacteria/parasites rendered irrelevant due modern medicine got first dose Pfizer week ago, fuck covid variants. conservative way, want less police state US right now, want borders controlled.. defunding police? idea even about. 

And rambling.. ""free speech"" loving people reporting deleting posts let stew desserts suppose  US willing pay max price immediately . actually read article, hit piece. explain process normally done couple years challenges condensing single year. Locked due widespread rule-breaking. Please review rules consider difference POLICY POLITICS. place litigate Israel-Palestine conflict. ok controls medicine actually goes areas though didn’t miss them. I’m pointing aren’t based anything meaningful, therefore worth considering. That’s pretty small minority acting like it’s common thing. wanna Debbie downer “Good News” thread, go ahead guess Americans believe

No, Americans believe things. least say dumb Americans. Less effective what?  seen that, got source? Ireland illegal travel 5km house, illegal meet anyone visit anyone, non essential businesses closed foreseeable future etc.

What happening Ireland terrible, mean situation Australia also terrible. Yes, actually EU get twice originally planned, nothing true previous statement. “zero covid” countries stand this? I’d imagine get enough people vaccinated would reopen? aware sensitive sounds? concerts happening US, shit's illegal. top states going go another summer reduced tax incomes deaths low. Businesses going go much longer significantly reduced revenue too. 

Just looking capitalistic view point there's zero chance summer somewhat normal. I'm willing bet end April - May everything packed again. Archived link: agree, general. also concerned general sort action-paralysis lead us staying pandemic mode much longer necessary.

I also think, though, public health experts exist order help society understand work trade-offs coordinated way. least, theory!

An every-man-for-himself solution would chaos last year. completely top approach also rely government officials taking risk opening since ""black white"" signal so, think means reluctant stick necks out.

It's complicated. Happy cake day btw! yah, fact people can't pay still treated part cost loaded upon pay. plus insurance companies skimming shit ton money.  fucking cruel. hope MSM gets swift kick gut know I'll ever trust issues story. We're officials doctors? base blood oxygen level, people lower feel fine. Feeling like would need ventilator different needing it. oxygen night, affected him, way feel overblowing way. clear mild, taking four months come out. bad would come sooner Especially UK? Deaths, hospitalisations infections ppummeted. Johnson commented yesterday hé would look opening soon  would mortality rate decreasing ~1% provide virus relevant evolutionary advantage? haven’t done yet either ones ~50-60% protection.

Are talking JNJ Novavax here?

If there’s clinical trial Moderna Pfizer’s vaccines new variants, strikes guess suggest 50-60% starting. Especially considering non clinical work done shown protective levels. Thank you! Great explanation!  give single doses healthy, young individuals? CDC best guess IFR aged 20-49 0.02%. even single dose 1/4 effect two doses, would likely make COVID comparable flu age group. genuinely curious idea would work not. already entertained? “I don’t expect announce lockdown living God protect us,” Magufuli 

Sounds like Bolsonaro Trump good company. 

Anyway, feel bad people living there...but I'll bottom dollar ban travel Tanzania force hand this. Sick word salad bro  often! Maybe per year every 2 years. husband flies (or prepandemic) every 3 months cross country work, got point first year wasn’t getting sick. totally believe that. another variant might cause cases rise would cause another strain Hospitals vulnerable vaccinated . Johnson Johnson may require boosters. Hell one busiest important roads area (Northern Virginia) dirt road one lane wooden bridges *2005*

Today six lanes speed limit 50. Israel offered vaccinate Palestinians, Palestinians refused offer. health minister entitled organize vaccination program, even would’ve much efficient accept help Israel. great. Let's hope Israeli government develops conscience provides vaccines Palestinians they're oppressing. We're lockdown go concert. reality normal.  world sue China? already production capacity mean vaccine every nation earth time. distribution huge obstacle nations infrastructure support vaccines  Listen, buddy, feel free look back dozens comments day find situations talking about, probably hundred two comments back, I’ve already extended far much goodwill someone seems pathologically incapable polite conversation. talk like one miserable widowed highschool teachers hates job riding last 5 years pension funded. Isn’t Moderna supposedly less effective now? Specifically say false? Sanitizing different, tear walls put new plumbing crazy expensive, for, like said, questionable benefit. really different walk existing sink wash hands vs building new sink door? juice worth squeeze. Come think it, Pfizer kinda sounds like soft drink brand. Sterilization? I’m in.  much higher economic output 300 years ago? Among vaccinated people probably pretty similar/the same. saying vaccine isn’t effective Israel Jordan? Yeah I'm disputing that. want people take statement wrong way think anyone go get vaccine easily come april. I’m telling to, explaining comes from. We’re 3%, understand understand still restrictions want end shit already Oh agree EU screwed large getting facilities build good time.

That change fact exporting countries refusing exports. country infrastructure produce allowed import EU. 

The USA Ana UK enough vaccines. Ah old Quit Fire method Oh right, new area made justify creation illegal settlements. Yea let’s make sure Palestinians don’t take advantage Israeli resources Israel forcefully taken away land owned Palestinians. coronavirus pandemic hit early 2020, musicians festivals began rescheduling early 2021, hopes things would control then.

Plenty variants popped spread around world point, U.S. vaccine designed prevent death hospitalization. still catch Covid. milder symptoms asymptomatic. don’t know viral load low enough prevent transmission still contagious. doesn’t seem communicated.

Mild severe. didn’t test asymptomatic. tested showed symptoms.

Nowhere anyone begging white people come save them. Read fucking article type knee jerk essays. mean dislike lot BJP government does, mean think **everything** bad. Outside internet, nuanced political opinions still exist. data one HMO Israel :/ miss normal Hey variant, didn’t hear bell! find really deliberate news source read listen to, can't flip ""let's see what's going on"" way, instead fully prepared skeptical doubt everything hear try understand what's going behind story, shut necessary. entertainment background noise like potentially toxic ideas.

Podcasts factual informative way digest going on, like Gottlieb (former FDA head) National Review podcast recently. known political/conservative channel podcast almost purely factual Gottlieb one voice reason throughout pandemic said, get shot... lucky opportunity get one. agree mixed messages misinformation going kill demand vaccine. worry 35-45% people eager get demand drop off, rest us get ASAP. Something like ""stop talking norm/normal, boring""  exactly accomplish moving forward? Yeah, far know warp speed funding production. I'm wondering much done ahead time considering vaccine approved doses available quickly ramped making much vaccine.  submission linking businessinsider.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

If anything, US healthcare system shown incompetence maximizing available supply.

This triumph federally backed research development, subsequent supply chain. Oh boy. hard enough refreshing page constantly get appointment earlier week(essential worker), floodgate opens everyone imagine there's going lot fighting vaccines. Chance *symptomatic* infection 5% non-vaccinated downvote want reason UK delaying 2nd dose 3 months. people saying wait awhile see vaccines long term side effects legitimate concerns? parroting anti vax conspiracies? really believe micro chip vaccines  agree it’s cheerful show, I’m sure it’s reporters faults. They’re reporting experts saying experts pretty gloomy :(

I still appreciate show. gets news reasonable time frame spend less time doomscrolling. Lmao bet sources Facebook post Dog, plan, get close 1 million vaccinations per day biden even stepped office? Half America go maskless spring.

That needs source Pfizer vaccine part Operation Warp Speed.  Except weird 3 month caveat CDC recommendations...  They, least couple days ago, said exposed need quarantine, vaccinated within last 3 months.  

It clear said that, did. Turmeric diet maybe, known anti inflammatory properties. Hitler sane person Limiting 75+ instead 65+ huge mistake. state’s response embarrassing frustrating. chat friend yesterday skeptical vaccines roll out. parents got she’s fixated “well may prevent transmission, even people vaccinated won’t able get back normal.” resent media medical experts part this. course hasn’t 100% proven also hasn’t disproven yet harp “we don’t know vaccine prevents transmission.” one liner going mentally fuck people isolated since March scared death concerned shit. Even flu kills kids. dude sharpie thing literally absolutely everything anyone ever said ever. Nothing went unanswered four years. much president sure found time respond every single critique matter minor was. level narcissism self-obsession normal. fair response. It’s unbelievable stupid are. found Germany paid majority development BioNtek vaccine asked nothing return. company Kay back money apart 100 million euro loan. conditions. America’s success vaccination thanks Germany’s efforts. bunch idiots politicians are. say so. Come back reality hits you. claim simply know yet whether (and much) vaccines prevent transmission? קדימההההה!! Neither ""good"" new strains... never said rank file leadership Democratic party, said journalists people social media attribute deaths Trump. Even Trump Death Clock assumed 60% avoidable death rate.

As example expert implying vast majority deaths preventable, [this article ""blood troubling loss life preventable,” said Dr. Steven Woolf, director emeritus Center Society Health Virginia Commonwealth University. “This infectious disease knew prevent, difficult is, far easier solve defeating Nazi Germany.""

When medical professionals suggesting preventable, implies far 40%. like 100M doses 100 days. promise deliver. said 100 days actually 300! There's trend last year camps readily accept bad news intensely scrutinize outright reject good news lot time. I've notice group get smaller time goes on, there's still quite people this. Vaccines ideology. basic foundation medical science. trials rushed, we’re farther out, they’re discovering more. It’s information best practice surrounding virus changing across board time first began. Everything unchartered. 

Link full transcript playing PR, absolutely nothing. latter. Obviously administration blame well let's honest taking marching orders Trump. honestly think accepting made error something trump do. Actually think would rather die literally die that. also look stuff he's lied inconsequential is. lot stuff even address would died own. felt need absolutely defend state 100 percent correct. absolutely NPD.

Also politics-wise think would fared better actually admitted made error caught covet rallied country hind make form attempt get virus control. squandered pretty golden political opportunity likely would gotten second term. even playing politics angle wrong thing  Wouldn’t easier get job web design/management? Lol what? Ever heard tyranny majority? mean cmon, Hitler popular democratic support, doesn’t mean shit thought killing innocent people change minds, would chance?

People antivaxxers respond logic empathy. did, antivaxxers start. Sorry, missed word. meant say **aren't** falling faster Jordan? That's bizarre part considering large difference vaccination rates. father trying convince get insisting leave infertile. scary thing he’s alone beliefs people don’t get vaccinated never chance controlling this.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  don’t understand vaccine works. prioritized. problem take couple months get them. Chicago opened group 1b, acknowledged *20 weeks worth people group*. It’s ok, they’ll wish got vaccine get Covid. Either way, antibodies formed you’ll protected get vaccine. landfills gonna full unused vaccines. 

Here cometh Oxford groupies! Also literally prevents Covid extreme majority cases. people idiots. got mine. sinovac, data one? convenient. Can’t protest thing want protest prevents it. Lol Sentence perpetual shock treatment ... 10 seconds 10 seconds Great news! yep masks &amp; distance still needed.

there's evidence vaccine stops contagious (the flu vaccine stop contagious either) &amp; everyone going vaccine time &amp; people never get vaccine would say still risk others, much risk people vaccinated. starting studies see children get vaccine instance though. No, drink way that. control group everyone else country “SEVERE COVID SYMPTOMS ISRAELIS TOOK COVID VACINE” Vaccine causes infinite increase severe cases compared deaths! Donald Trump's doing, case actually serious. quick forget project light speed, without could never happened, billions greenlit Trump speed development, testing manufacture vaccine. Science definitely biases too, data analysis representation example UK variant already wide spread that. Closing border late variant also keep SA variant Brazilian variants away. SA variant already discovered prior closure, hopefully air travel help contain it. it’s not. media overblowing this. author piece Latino.. 

I read infantalizing minorities immigrants. think unique challenges lot different communities overcoming vaccine hesitancy need address order build herd immunity. spoke specific ones, example bad Spanish translations public health websites. Oklahoma currently Covid worth constant fear unless you’re 70+ diabetes hypertension. Otherwise risk much low “constant fear”, even remotely understand statistics covid CFR asked builder plan build house showed blueprint would say great done? know build house takes drawings. 

Their building things drawings blueprints understand clearly built anything. blueprint house coordinate digging foundation, pouring concrete slab, coordinating electrical plumbing, finalizing installation. arguably much harder blueprint requires coordinating lots people different schedules.

If build infrastructure pass vaccines states plan blueprint. people going vaccinated states vaccines requires mobilizing nurses, doctors, web designers appointment software, storage facilities, spaces safely give vaccine, space make sure negative effects giving vaccine. exactly operation warp speed failed. Like house blueprint plan build materials got everybody site one put together plan build aka distribute vaccine. Yeah like NZ Western Australia 2 weeks ago. Basically restrictions infections all. boom, one case leaks quarantine get 5 days lock another 8 mask wearing.

We became complacent. didn't, already ordered whatever they're gonna order last year (not enough) amended since can't ask Pfizer 40 million doses there's queue. waited \*vague gestures toward safety\* reality politics government wanting admit botched procurement planning advance late party due incompetence. ...what happens blood expires? bin it? According CDC: you’ve exposed you’re vaccinated, need quarantine. Effectively suggesting cannot pass virus others. He's wrong. manufacturing sector died 80s coming back. Chicago allocating vaccines specifically teachers, prioritizing everyone else group 1a &amp; 1b. Probably 5 days. guarantee lockdowns from. Zero covid isn’t sustainable solution USA Today pretty conservative Lancet science supposed change? supposed see friends family ever again? go eat, go concerts, movies? travel? 

Sickness part life. People accept risk take part society There's headline saying 95% deaths could prevented Trump office? Could point citation? Democrat leader point said this? 

The truth many thousands deaths WOULD prevented real leadership. people insignificant simply add 50%. 40% still hell lot PREVENTABLE American deaths. There’s reason mean “justification” keep schools closed? guidelines open schools safely can’t met (and truly can’t many, many schools), suggest? sounds like you’re saying schools open anyways, even can’t meet recommendations make opening remotely safe. supposed do? heard wrong. 2-3 month. Wales ok tho Can't really blame them, false advertising bait switch good ... Australia 3 months complete freedom lockdowns. much better rest world It’s seriously like entire planet learning viruses mutate. feel like I’m going crazy. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* say that? “Working pretty well”

Is April 1st already? It's... opposite hypothetical like Australia, currently entering 3rd total lockdown, 2 hours exercise permitted? Seems like strategy worked great.... Biontech ... Pfizer, could give creators credit? make argument literally anything though.

Everything everyone affects everyone else, nobody island. argument, stated, justify unlimited government intrusion individual liberties.

That said, actually largely supporter mandatory vaccinations. Four Seasons Total Landscaping. Mask mandates basically lockdown me. 

Masks distancing degrade experience fun activities point you’re better spending money at-home fun saving masks required. long there’s masks going bare essentials getting stuff delivered. ~~nothing~~ little transmission...   

Yes, 66% less likely get get transmission still possible. prevent Coivd-19 though..... 100% reduces chances getting substantially Ah, misinterpreted that. Yeah, think reasonable position, assuming cases continue decline (which looks likely). lie fucking die. Palestinian government specifically told Israel want help. specifically asked help instead.

[Palestinians: ask Israel COVID-19 makes sense - pretty much given even stepped office. Would nice actual challenging goal. Hoping step closer 2M day finish thing off. extra level hate anyone scams people money medical reasons. fucked someone else? One high schools steps bottoms bathroom doors allowed use feet swing open. thought pretty ingenious. Sadly, seen catch *fucking SEVEN* years since high school. Yeah that's weird American Big Pharma thing. - rightly - get offered vulnerable UK. anyone dies dude chose wear one mask blood CDCs hands. many people could saved wearing two get go? I’m wearing two either. you’d like wear 12 masks certainly prerogative BioNtek vaccine paid 80% German government, without asking anything return. Every single person who’s live saved Israel thanks German tax payers. 
It won’t make 6 million Jews killed WW2. hope goes little towards debt owed Jewish people. Lol, never reasonable compliment US opinion

Remarkable Public health officials lying public ""for good"" one worst aspects mess. done nothing erode trust public health guidelines vaccines.

They said ""Get vaccinated. probably lowered risk spreading covid, sure yet, continue wear mask people vaccinated."" simple, straightforward understandable.

Instead, say, ""You wear mask even getting vaccinated! vaccines stop transmission!"" absurd simplification makes people distrust vaccine makes people even less likely follow public health guidelines. idiotic.

It's ""Masks work! buy them."" again. say: ""If acts like pretty much every virus know, vaccine likely stop transmission.""

But we're keeping 'this virus Mars' routine, reason. doubled price EU paying vaccine got quantities first... UK unfortunately. time start adjusting behavior. like people think Biden whoever come say...""OK, over, go back normal now!"".

&amp;#x200B;

That's gonna work. Want normality? Start acting normal. Masks work well 100% guarantee like claimed. vaccine get? Anecdotally, son got asymptomatic class mate, gave me, presume gave son 2 week quarantine. None us every showed symptoms. sickness, death inevitable.   hope imo absolutely deserve researchers. know works research behind IP company? also sure case them. Eh, time tell. one get? That's article said. Czech Republic turned offer expensive. study linked article: 
""However, majority individuals whose homotypic neutralization titres modest – including 50% convalescent COVID-19 individuals recipients single dose vaccine – heterotypic neutralization dropped negligible levels. loss cross-neutralization particularly notable B1.351 potential implications vaccine efficacy populations VOC dominates moderate levels antibodies generated vaccination.""

It seems booster shots inevitable point. Would naive think still provides anywhere near 95% efficiency since Novavax J&amp;J saw significant drop. 

However vaccine still provide level protection delay return normality. means we'll need keep booster shots time time big deal really. confusing Astrazeneca/Oxford vaccine others. Moderna, side effects started 23 hours shot went almost exactly 24 hours. article says ‘full protection’ 7 days second dose. Reuters article yesterday graphic suggests it’s still getting effective 7 days.  Same, think case. Especially hospitalizations dropping like are, can't people dying one's hospital Sounds like fun! Good luck good job getting shot! I'm NY, there's definite vibe amongst family friends soon get vaccinated we're done masks tip-toeing around everyone. Public officials would state vaccine controls spread, mean control spread. people latched onto thought meant even vaccination spread virus. like every fatalistic pessimistic idea, spread like wildfire. know whether applies Astrazeneca vaccine South African variant yet. Good.

Also, future reference: *not* sign commercial lease allows cause termination 180 days notice. Like damn, sucks (for non coronavirus reasons). think it’s much simpler less nefarious: 

They’re afraid wrong give wrong information, they’re erring side caution. reason we’ve seen Fauci others times seem err bizarrely conservative side - always unknowns chances things could change worse- they’d rather give small incremental tidbits rather risk saying “hey opened June!” seeing new variant emerge J&amp;J supply get approved etc etc etc 

I’m saying it’s right strategy, one think makes sense given they’re saying doing. also tries avoid people getting optimistic deciding pandemic over. 

Frankly, think messaging much optimistic goal dates advertised widely. Vaccinated Millennials complain severe depression suicidal thoughts

Non vaccinated millenials complain went headline would grab attention. Figured luck gonna run sooner later.

Granted, compared high thing past still relatively low. encouraging, thanks. Glad hear reduces viral loads transmission. going to. sarcastic 100M 100 days pathetic goal people defended still. Makes sense, think assuming people die within 2 weeks. death counts still high couple weeks I’ll scratching head Walk one chief yeah, fucking depressing fuck . . . I'm essential worker, building engineer downtown major city, yesterday learned *none* staff willing get it. Security, janitorial staff, two reports think vaccine ""scary,"" ""do trust it."" Yep, people like sure. like say, it’s harmful parents sitting front cnn susceptible hogwash. mother fully vaccinated already obsessing get booster even thought effectiveness moderna dramatically decreased variants... Always morons confident think also realizing soon going make sure enough demand vaccines. give message even vaccination get life back, lot people get them.

They need say, get vaccinated, get life back. people want get it. I'd take incompetence USA's... think anyone going allowed meet new baby Thanksgiving BEST want try too. UK like me? wonder best way achieve is. SinoVac inactivated virus, typically elicits short mid-term IgG/IgM antibody responses, T/B-cell responses (think flu-shot). It'll likely stop-gap yearly vaccine adenoviruses mRNA widespread give longer lasting immunity. think dropped /s Todays death numbers reporting anomaly, according NYTimes, probably due backlog reports Ohio.

Otherwise, deaths currently starting decline winter peak. Deaths lag cases close month. going meet 100M doses 100 days? averaging 1.5M-1.6M doses. Cases peaked 30 days ago. Deaths lag weeks. Remember top everything else (deaths lagging, etc), lot 50 million older at-risk population. Lots health care workers, essential workers, people going die it. still know lots 65+ trying get vaccine. would consider one people built year watching many people approach absolutely zero care choose safe rather sorry. theres 10 people family/family friends died COVID far. probably 50 people know gotten it.

sure, im high strung, know fact also saved life &amp; life immediate family. many times people invited over, test positive COVID days later.

so many people give fuck 

even people watched father die COVID already planning vacations, weddings, trips. know people got vaccine &amp; went vacation next day (it doesnt reach 100% effective 2 weeks later).

I want shake people like GOOD NEWS STILL NEED CAREFUL It’s especially good news CDC officially advising this, IMO. Clearly there’s convincing evidence vaccination shown reduce transmission. Actually students aren’t tested enough know impact community spread. Primatene Mist is. takes time people die. Deaths trending along cases hospitalizations fall cliff next weeks deliberately pick pessimistic experts find (like Osterholm). experts significantly optimistic mainstream media. didn't. 100% full shit. think we've suspected would next seasonal flu type thing. hope vaccines, *just* seasonal flu type thing.

Shame Berkeley narrowly focused Covid can’t see physical psychological harm they’re inflicting. think that's right, second dose strong antibody response new variants stop people getting ill all. That's different AZ one. Agreed. hard make points without getting blasted.

A couple notes healthcare USA:

- poor people get free healthcare (Medicaid)
- Old people 65 think) get free healthcare (Medicare) (this include prescription coverage though - must purchased separately)
- Children &lt;= 26 years old covered parents plan
- people get healthcare employer
- insurance plans federally required ""out pocket maximums"". means there's hard limit ever pay insurance. Usually like $3,000 $6,000. Yes lot, keep mind see stories people receiving $250,000 medical bills going bankrupt. Unless insurance, usually bunch bullshit.

The people get screwed make much qualify Medicaid, get coverage employer. people usually make slightly minimum wage part time positions.

There definitely problems, blown proportion - usually rile people up. dont dude dick Look get frustration “Excessive bail shall required, excessive fines imposed, __nor cruel unusual punishments inflicted__.” PA can’t get appointment love money. Apparently get 5 start refreshing pharmacy websites try snag spot. feels like hunger games. Maybe hop plane LA. really low risk, people endanger others time. worth taking away civil liberties, IMO system propose respect, times, universal declaration human rights. Sacrificing human rights perceived health security worthy trade scientists telling us could bad thing, reacted appropriately. only... hospital get it. general public, much. probably near constant testing caught got bad. could effectively given things better used early treatment. comments seem suggest give shit mental health too. order say data evidence efficacy, need know exposed didn’t develop disease. 

What if, people vaccinated, 544 people exposed virus, therefore 100% still developed symptoms? 

We don’t know data. point rather don’t know anyone thinks gone summer isn’t paying attention. However idea life won’t normal vaccinations better rapid testing seems unrealistic.

Like I’m sure next time fly plane vaccinated still wearing mask maybe rapid test beforehand airport. who’s gonna care travel safe enough general? UK export restrictions won’t ever eligible anyway young healthy. time it’s turn current version ineffective new mutations start 0 vaccinating vulnerable. accepted cool it.

Germany paid majority BioNtek vaccine development. Turns got 375 million Euros nothing. conditions attached. pretty stupid. 

The Chinese people fault CV19, Americans responsible Spanish flue.

Federal prison probably still worse Sure, people want bad, democracy doesn’t work great. effective political system propose? point government isn’t reflecting people vehicle change. far Australian government taken steps protect everyone society part people agree Sigh. really explain you?? Wow someone lives America, pandemic completely control bad sounds.

Most people know anyone died COVID. 400,000 dead sounds like insane number realize mostly elderly people country 3M people die ordinary year.

I think state, mortality rate something like 1500 per million people. worst states 2000. numbers, average person unlikely even know single person died pandemic. Yes pandemic still exists people dying, I'd rather deal COVID live government arrests people trying organize protest Facebook, leaving house without mask, buying groceries twice single day.  Oxford one 10% effective, preliminary results, South African variant. IIRC sputnik v uses different second dose compared first dose That's basically happened us.  heard via friends hospital neighborhood clinic needed arms taking unscheduled walk-ins.  first day open sign websites totally broken appointments actually existed.  Got first shot, second early next week. lucky hell, things much tighter now. 
I felt bit guilty jumping turnstile regular doc said no, get way can. correct. US, UK Australia first cases days apart. Damn dude, that's crazy good numbers 0.1% people vaccinated became infected correct. missed part. Thanks. Religion worsens state world yet again. Yes, totally understand. actually case young people vocal Covid-friendly behavior, think social media effect. think Covid is, least, generational symbol, know? 18-29 year olds similar positions right now, especially concerning school social stuff.

No, talked people know going vacation next day. Everything else implied referring anyone people general. said people know once. said know people also. However reference people COVID, relevant. 

It really helps remember typed. Fuck that. It’s going trash Memorial Day. @pewdiepie - deaths AZ vaccine good UK variant? do. return. Schools ventilation all. windows usually don’t open, room even windows. need reading vaccines France prevalence 20-25%, Germany 20%)

The latest figures 6% Germany 14% France. figure Germany confirmed RKI yesterday. I’m sure wrote ‘against narrative’ much ‘blatantly untrue’. hell predicted 3 million deaths? [The pretty solid write back. It’s doom gloom people may think. virus needs place live, it’ll continue circulating time probably modify seasonal flu vaccine include vaccines now. Actually healthcare providers really reliable source data Israel every single person country member one four HMOs. Always Israel front line...  What? Ok Donald still waiting everyone else get vaccinated, absolutely insist get PCR tests.

But PCR tests pretty high false negative rate (coming ""negative"" really positive), they're reliable unless people quarantine least 10 days test visit.

I know that's unrealistic lot people work, etc. really make sure everyone gets test least week *fully quarantines* time taking test visit. ""rough day"" second dose first dose already primed immune system react pathogen.

If live virus, expect first dose ""rough day"". agree completely. point mentioning stuff would tap brakes ""the pandemic over, back normal"" message.

There one comment saying hoping back normal seven days second dose regardless antivaxxers.

7 days even enough vaccine fully effective.

The concern everyone saying im vaccinated that's good enough, everything reopens immediately without safeguards, virus mutates everyone still get infected carrier go back uncontrolled spread potentially could gotten ahead it.

Only time tell. year particular taken lot faith people away though. ISRAEL KILLED ALL. Israel kills millions Palestinians every single day!! Exactly, old, want children miss schooling attempt indirectly ""protect"" disease. benefitted greatly schooling want tomorrow's kids benefit too. Ah. Never know days. point pretty sure COVID transmission via surfaces food negligible risk. ""BREAKING NEWS! 4 CASES SEVERE COVID RECEIVING VACCINE!"" - /s Good idea. Surrender, get back work consuming. Accept older (expensive) people need die. many total cases though? Agreed, blue countries map need lot ones red. know. It’s sad leverage. Yep, kids getting home schooled pretty much home since March March 8th fully immunized going back school day back normal life mask don’t mind since don’t like peoples germs anyway. Shut fuck up, moron. ""Illness people, that's also true mental illness, apparently""- comparing inoculated population good control population, exposure rates similar two populations. means amount severe cases statistically lower population.

Sure one start fish dataset select dependent variable find severe cases may worse sub-population, statistically sound method analysis. Gonna book ticket Israel hop West Bank get vaccine! It’s good news there’s good way distribute efficiently take long time herd immunity. mom got second dose yesterday. wait almost 3 hours line distribution inefficient Oh wow, well that’s even better. what’s point then? lol partners like PAMF reporting counts several days behind. Ok fucko amount virus particles wild, eventually go zero not? even 1 billion Palestinians. paid offered massive quantities data. Also rumor we’re going start manufacturing vaccines soon. like long skinny Canada.

The Chile north. works criteria simple new information.

Yes, need wear masks coming months population gets vaccinated, entire next year unrealistic quite frankly, stupid. right. think pissed USA allowing exports EU is.

This completely personal opinion, take whatever that’s worth — point many people getting vaccinated, enough (especially contagious variants around) guarantee won’t another peak, another strain hospitals. moving right direction every sense. But, people need keep wearing masks *for now*, IMO that’s push officials right that. one wants backslide another peak. Biden vaccinated, he’s trying convey vaccinated people can’t throw precautions right minute. Even accept premise Israel country full evil psychopaths (which absurd best anti-Semitic worst), even make sense purely selfish perspective deny vaccine Palestinians, vaccines work properly everybody gets them.

""Bring back Cosmo!"" chants twelve thousand strong crowd streets Jerusalem. know big companies like Kroger wouldn’t surprise me. Looks like total deaths past year Covid 5304 Israel. already low death rate. ""Severe cases"" really mean anything. Vaccines studies take much longer anyone say works treat type cure. plenty scientific studies too, know reading hard you, keep using emojis since writing something logical hard kid. anyone else run people say things like “I’ve house since last March! dare go social!” ? 

Ok, cool. aren’t fucking hero living like hermit never leaving house. aren’t moral high ground quarantined last year. Sorry. know desperately want everyone stroke ego, it’s happening. us real life jobs can’t sit bedroom day. pity people. 

If anything, I’ve got respect people found lower risk ways still see friends contribute community. Cant wait exit pandemic people continue pull moral high ground (stupidly) sat bedroom year. never know reddit can't turn opportunity quote Bill Rights. stores already offer gift cards people get flu shot every year. seem like massive stretch. get $10 go, like schedule flu shot get lunch way store. 4000 deaths suddenly appeared Ohio, excess deaths takes certain states, go ahead selective work kindergarten 4 kids gotten it...I N95 masks (1 day school week), wore glasses gloves, stressed importance social distancing even brought air purifier help already cracking windows slightly help air flow....I can't think anything else could done prevent it....it spread schools creative sculpture teacher college put camp best friend cause gave glass water American gi. 16 years old. friend survive. immigrated states adult. Yeah wrong many aspects... Idk, I'm trying understand common viewpoint people mention happened generally okay acceptable real issue lockdowns. see lot confuses me.

But try real response, I'd start pointing plan lockdowns end virus time die thus undoing momentum built, achievable adequate compliance. premise lockdowns last whole pandemic something serious person ever championed, paying everyone's rent every month never supposed table. way state addressed issue tie stimulus unemployment, worked well ended surprisingly low numbers considering fully open 2 week lockdown. course, ended eventually pandemic we've fair share turns ""surging hotspot"" winter. idea pausing rent payments varying degrees also worth investigating. land lords take bulk expenses (read: reduced profits) saving lives one year seems better everyone take cost supporting landlords pandemic. CVS Walgreens plan, finally rolling states. trying get vaccine directly populations higher barriers access. going include communities color and, case mostly Russian-speaking Holocaust survivors, immigrants. literally part public health strategy. It’s simple hardly selling point. countries people concerns options. 65, risk dying, given AZ Italy (the subject article). notion people wanting options lead mass deaths, plain hysterics. medical professionals, let’s hear out. True, we've done now, think still supports argument look ways speed trials next crisis. r/ihadastroke point documented cases people mild first infections reinfected subtle variants weren’t much different yet people substantially ill second time.

It may variant issue. 17 Lebanon covid One Federal plans accepted states partner CVS Walgreens vaccinate nursing home residents.

West Virginia rejected distributed supplies local pharmacies. one highest vaccination rates among states CVS Walgreens weeks behind. personally not. estimated 'figure' Q1, going actual history actual facts thus far predict shortfall (that perhaps might papered changing doses Pfizer 5 6 despite enough syringes). Moderna shipments keep getting cut every time end sight, Pfizer still delivered large quantity vaccine given week date. actually see 400-500k doses week coming in, I'll believe - justification believe anything Trudeau saying considering he's wrong every time since December. I'm eligible. need register me, since I'm 17, get available younger people. false.

If told anything else (that orders like standing line one that's earlier paid earlier) leid media (or ever get information from, e.g. Reddit, even worse) false... blocked eventually. sooner. said start new formulation, took admission failure time get tested enough vaccines.

Anyways, think Sanofi GSK separate plans get mRNA technology. interesting, center missing exploited children gives number 230,000 per year, note many double counted children run away one time within calendar year.... also nice enough including funding 76,000,000 bucks. quick google search notes hundreds similar charities serving population. 

as far actual government stats (aka charities trying raise money) NCIC reports 87,000 missing people 35% children 18. 

if really want get weeds, 350 people 21 abducted strangers year. 

TLDR: facebook feed full misinformation - government getting hook institute lockdowns introduced start with, dodging blame variants fault. houses architecture yes that's true. work fridge drafting say plans absolutely spell that. yes need contractor coordination We're actually ahead european countries aside Denmark UK count per capita doses. far ahead. EU needs get fucking move vaccination, [the speed vaccination hardly increased month Good. would absolute logistical nightmare. need register get we're approved. Yes business. Passenger numbers would rapidly drop Covid tests mandatory. seen government started require international flights. already low wasn’t continuous funding government, tens thousands people would jobs right now.

P.S.- saying it’s good bad thing require Covid tests. I’m indifferent since need 3 days prior. tested negative virus day started show symptoms. Someone could test negative positive time step airplane. lot (maybe 880,000) majority custody disputes something like 99 percent missing children returned home safely. Child abductions strangers exceedingly rare. holidays weather especially cold, inevitable. wearing masks, federal government cannot force states follow request. longer United, instead divided States Ugh, sad... beautiful time.  implies started trying first place, think could challenged easily enough Well, can't register without him. 100 average IQ ~1.6M shots per day we're now, reason stopped steady growth rate we've seeing, we'd deliver another ~120M shots end April. Adding people already vaccinated, we'd around 100M people first dose 70M people second. 255M adults US, would put us ~27.5% fully vaccinated ~39% least first dose.

That puts us DEEP 1C. 55M people age 65, add ""essential workers"" people qualifying conditions. Take account 100% eligible people actually getting vaccine. absolutely makes sense end April could opening whoever wants it. Especially considering conservative estimates take account increases number shots delivered per day. No, understandably so. Legitimising idiocy isn’t way forward here. It’s transitional year...😔 Couple things. children go missing taken family members (often non custodial parents) people known them. Others runaways. Stranger abductions children extremely rare. 99.8% missing children come home. http://www.pollyklaas.org/about/national-child-kidnapping.html 

Despite elementary schools parents teach pretty much every kid stranger danger. Amber alerts national strategy track missing kids. Parents often don’t allow kids travel neighborhoods alone fear abduction. mass awareness this. pretty clear transmission advantages gone less 10% UK cases months ago 90% cases, similar patterns starting emerge across Europe share cases increasing. issue actual % increase transmissibility hard calculate.  gone 1% cases 90% cases? ""Enjoy"" pandemic can, numbers right, *looks* like things pretty open mid April. many people vaccinated amount people already it, enough bodies virus infect really impact things been. Walmart scum corporation never tested mRNA vaccines large population though, correct? Yes. Starting slow first gets better. interesting explanation. Thanks answering question! involved high number super-spreading events cases surging (especially densely packed population center), absolutely could happen. likely aspect true, slight transmission advantage even approach 50% gone party hon anyone else notice media going hard coronavirus variants progress destroyed bc variants? Even though already proven Pfizer Moderna vaccines work them. seems like many outlets grasping straws days fearmongering continues. think life return normal first concerts return know. Everything helps COVID, nothing helps COVID.

Hmm. Meh. keep trash vaccine. Biontech mRNAs million times better anyway. soon EU enough mRNA everyone. source this? number correct. college isn’t back totally normal fall semester definitely deferring. 

I’m losing half college experience this, especially adults vaccinated. think counts vector (Sputnik/AZ/J&amp;J) vaccines mRNA (BNT/MRNA/CureVac) vaccines. easy adapt new variants. US financial ruin consequence COVID drake\_sreaming\_lets\_go.gif No, agree Fortin means.

What I'm saying, would like confirmation changed 17 million Q2 hiding bad news (or correcting earlier errors communication). think probably right, Anand charge Procurement constant tweets lack clarifying (despite people catching replying) makes wonder.

I know originally saying 20 million Q2. either hiding bad news, hiding earlier miscommunication, miscommunication now. scared changes nothing virus capability kill spare you. might change ability infect also less careful. select daily change reported itll show yesterdays numbers 2 mil daily COVID tracker showing 3,532 U.S. fatalities already today even 3:30 EST (12:30 PST). correct seems awfully high early day might states entering backlog? wonder terminal velocity going vaccinations per day JJ comes online.

Status:

F Community transmission big driver per article. sub become denier driven time goes on. insane. think part getting people remain vigilant spread COVID. might control hundreds thousands people still die around world, curb numbers people act responsibly. 

Same ""the vaccine save might prevent transmitting it"". think message get people vaccinated keep wearing masks people walking around without masks claiming vaccinated. Nice. probably related herd immunity. GSK/Sanofi vaccine still track Q4 approval deliveries right? really hope accounted new variants used booster shots. mean, theme parks open back schools also reopen. I’m supposed go LV May. Maybe even concert, idk. Vaccine companies like it, actually people one shot stronger immune response compared virus two. common sense Agree I’m ground CA well nothing behaviorally changed. people go work going work, people parties still parties. people carefully still carefully. got around 40 percent county (LA) infected 1.2 million least 1st shot vaccinated (with crossover previous infections vaccinated especially HCW population.). It’s virus running immunity already exposed along seasonality. get they're this, agree Coronaviruses particular proven worthy attention. said, mRNA vaccines designed ready test within weeks getting virus' genetic sequence, know much time effort actually save next coronavirus pandemic emerges. 

And mRNA vaccine production capacity, long keep production lines running, e.g. continuing make booster shots virus, using mRNA common flu vaccines, manufacturing much bottleneck future mRNA vaccines.

It seems biggest speedup going come speeding trials. Phase II done pretty quickly, phase III took longest. Speeding trials going take honest hard evaluation much risk we're willing accept.

We required two months safety follow-up data Phase III trials considering EUA, almost severe vaccine side effects show within days. 

The potential risk low-incidence side effects found start dosing lot people, like Pandemrix causing narcolepsy 1 every 18,400 patients, weighed certainty allowing people die disease wait analyze data.

Challenge trials thorny ethical area, certainly want run disease really high fatality rate like Ebola, something like COVID19, young healthy people generally suffer severe disease, might make sense. great news! makes feel safer finally going back school March, assuming rate continues like .

2M+ per day amazing! Gonna interesting see biden administration actually decides ""listen science"" said would 

I feeling they're gonna listening unions instead link, Major General Fortin says: ""Allow start saying already talked six million doses first quarter, 20 second quarter forty-five million doses third quarter."" 

To means 6M Q1, 20M Q2 45M Q3. MGen Fortin also went say would 80M doses total. cumulative make sense 45 doses Q3 can't equal 80M doses total.  


MGen Fortin also released vaccine schedule mid January expected deliveries vaccines. chart shows 13M Canadians fully vaccinated end Q2 approved vaccines (Pfizer Moderan). 3M fully vaccinated Canadians Q1 means 10M Q2 thus 20M doses. Disclaimer: say know ***a lot***. I'm adjacent field, read lot last year, biologist, immunologist. probably know most, def much proper immunologist.

But think question epidemiological one biological one, per se. overall question is, trying optimize? we're trying reduce total amount deaths population, that's epidemiology question. we're trying protect individuals, that's closer immunological/general biological question.

To answer question, caveats, think depends rest community stands. everyone age 50 access vaccine (and we're basically left people want now), think would still focus getting people full two-dose vaccine, prioritizing specific younger people likely get exposed.

The reason why, I'm concerned putting selective pressure virus encourage evolve. vaccinate **a lot people low efficacy**, we're crushing virus we're giving huge pressure mutate new variant evade vaccines.

In words, worry long-term, ""half-dose everyone now"" strategy seriously backfire encouraging evolution new variants.

For reason, western world needs get freaking act together figure **global vaccination strategy** really true poorer countries get vaccinated 2022 2023, become breeding grounds variants keep recurring render ***all*** vaccines useless.

EDIT: **TL;DR Vaccinating slowly and/or partially could seriously backfire generating new variants natural selection**. So, sorta want answer original question ""correct"" answer hurry f\*\*\* get everyone fully vaccinated ASAP. think 2021 better? envy them. hope lucky notebook-esque ending wife time comes.  are. Although, think studies done showing children transmit virus nearly easy adults do.  UK Department Blame Shifting Yes! remember, want put volume single bottle (basically less headspace). Thank god  Wait actually doesn’t believe Covid? greeter wally world sits counts people pad...

If report someone store without mask, literally nothing use people perceive risk COVID-19 children good litmus test see actually following science. believe kids anywhere near level risk adults, know really care actual scientific research.

[Remember, CDC clearly states flu dangerous **for children** risk complications healthy children higher flu compared COVID-19. However, infants children underlying medical conditions increased risk flu COVID-19. Young children higher risk severe illness flu. need that. mean lot governors, regardless party, lied? I’m sitting Florida shocked. Shocked...  Good news, embarrassment required weeks months long delays regulatory approval. They're literally going fill bottles liquid. That's it. extra deaths due delay worth it? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ actually evidence children children transmission relatively uncommon vaccinate them! It’s like droves teachers entering workforce replace sick dead teachers, let alone leaving profession. merely statistical, essence, anecdotal.

lmao Anecdotal worked Target mid 2010's. actually following walmart wages. One 3 4 steps 8.25 10 walmart always made first target announced walmart did.

Stimulus worked fine, worked $8/hr time pandemic hit. exactly killing financial security front close quite.

I sure immigrant directly related unless also filed taxes, case sympathies, know used justify unnecessary deaths. room mate son immigrant even speak english even almost deported Trump admin, (his mother) able receive stimulus. CDC clearly idea like inside public school.

Deploy military suspend constitution? didn’t happen Trump sure fuck ain’t happening Biden.  This. COVID October received first Moderna vaccine late January. knocked us day two.

What Walmart do? Allowed people whatever wanted. 

There difference company values here.  Texas and, well, son's school still several COVID cases anyway. hope work, feel work well might think.

We’ve put best position given current state pharmaceutical industry. Math hard. fraction US covid population ended long-term myocardial scarring resulting mild cases? actually correct though. natural immunity somewhere one two shots vaccine. two shots vaccine gives somewhat stronger response compared someone severe case based natural immunity. reinfected variant, I’m saying also happened pre-variant reinfections people got sicker second time around. It’s common, human immune system highly variable one individual next, it’s impossible draw meaningful conclusions one case report. Yeah, Ebola.

Schools cesspools germs! don’t meant forever. safety wise. haven’t needed start yet kicked 10 shades fuck Covid competent government clear strategy. body, choice - even means choice makes sick! matter. know people continue embarrass defending Trudeau, even got syringes - would - also matter TRAINING people. people keep thinking ordering bunch syringes solve everything **even government** says not.  Even specialized syringes, provinces reporting problem drawing sixth dose consistently. experts British Columbia estimate sixth dose drawn half time. “[Even if] everybody gets best training, everyone using right syringe, we’re going get sixth dose 75 per cent time, max,” Alberta’s health minister Tyler Shandro said Tuesday response there’s “human aspect” green-lighting six-dose regimen, said Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief public health officer. “It’s easy” extract six doses vial, said French. “It’s certain vial, vaccinators always able obtain six doses,” said. “You perhaps need certain level experience. there’s issue training people administer vaccine.

There’s guarantee things always get better. one bit shitty least nobody sending get blown pieces war, die climate collapse induced famine, like grandchildren. don’t see harm it. states remember washing hands whole bag sink thing, think probably stopped soon after. Erm... talking planning vacation, trip wedding here. talking about?

Nobody saying anything wearing masks nonsense mentioned. 

You calling people general, individually, planning vacation’s etc. gave specific time frame information. 

Do favor kiddo. Go get brown paper bag breath to, help calm down. sit quiet room. 

You talk argument. literally don’t one yet provide coherent description point is. First people, apparently people, planning vacations. people pulling black tie leave funeral home. Putting pair shorts espadrilles saying fuck I’m wearing mask etc going vacation. it? 

Top tip you. trying make point. always helps one. Okay? (at least 200, wrote another comment this)20x reduction cases 10x reduction proportion severe cases vaccinated infections. could even reduction young people could imagine. Bc right talking mostly elderly. Right? tired masks. started ripping mine minute get outside feels like oppressive muzzle. I’m dicknosing lot it’s accident. can’t stand them. Thousands aren’t dying every day waiting prime deliveries. welcome government traded data proved could vaccinate massive quantities people rapidly. usefulness proving ground given priority. dare ask questions. Reddit fucking stupid. recovered, would prefer get one dose avoid rough day second dose recovery, guess I'll see like get jab #1 numerous studies already that, found asymptomatic people rarely spread covid. 

Can cite few, please? Thanks advance. Somebody literally told me, ""We know side effects long term, RNA someone's body!"" explain RNA is...already every single cells well studied. like, ""How know that?"" explain worked evolutionary biologist degree focus genetics. still buy it.

Side effects not, side effects coronavirus are...long term health problems potentially death. far, real side effects vaccine found. I'll take fucking chances. Name checks out! Oh stop Redditor sarcasm. Article 3, right life, doesn’t mean government authority circumvent human rights reduce risk death. Article 3 direct response concentration camps, somewhat ironic bring actually. 

You’re completely misinterpreting right life clause think relation covid restrictions way Totally makes sense. seems strange night every one US suddenly saying lol still fully understand 6 million doses administered, includes 523,000 people given two doses, number cases country gone much, things considered. math, that's 5% population fully vaccinated, 50% rest population least first dose. 
 
Like corona measures place something? feel like already bigger effect new infection rates currently seeing someone ELI5 going IHME particular live (New York) currently steady downward trend (re: Deaths) since holiday spike, IHME removed ""rapid vaccine rollout"" tab prediction model (which weird, vaccine rollout going key recovery) base prediction on: likely projection, universal mask wearing, variant spread, worse case scenario.

The model shows state, without vaccine distribution, severely peaking mid-April steadily declining, projection based variant spread. ""worst case"" scenario red line lower lines June 1st. 

How ""worse case"" lower variant spread? vaccine rollout longer taken consideration? makes sense me. It’s almost like punishments don’t fix underlying issues leading bad behavior. copy HTML machinery creates it. mean fair president gets helicoptered ton places. Finally someone common sense thinks head. wish could upvote 1000x I’m citing academic literature. quite literally current news. see people don’t want hear it, someone who’s actually specialist, it’s truth. People bad situations past 'endured much worse' usually fucked PTSD would kill wives children routine night terrors, especially veterans, limit suggesting care? That's true ok 

It's ok bring one parties healthcare. mysterious controversial. That's I'm saying true based support lack support legislation. take personally attack personally, secret. rich countries want get coronavirus control countries first. would poor look showing increased infections deaths among people gets they’re shipping vaccine away countries. Right. think ends massive scale, least US, sometime spring / early summer. lot people unable go parties, people dinner, send kids school, etc. years come.

A lot people talked mental health toll COVID one aspect never discussed. help people psychologically unable stop social distancing, even safe so? Fake news Ha definitely sarcastic system propose respect, times, universal declaration human rights. 

This right? said that? How's vaccine rollout going there? Ah, yes see that. 


I think much better--those conditions handled medical professionals. Still sure ""smoking"" works lumped rest them--are people going smoke cig way doc ask vaccine? 


Part thinks might best completely open everyone start...at least way would less vaccines going waste can't find someone right group give to.  Every person vaccinated helps rest us, including high-risk groups. It’s NPR didn’t somehow make story idpol too. Seriously radio station become shell former shell Waiting fucking stupid. Take first shot available you. They’re losers temporarily validated NEETs. think they’ll give up? LOL. I'm quite sure mean this. disease always going spreading (eventually become endemic). main point restrictions reduce death rate prevent hospitals overwhelmed. death rate low longer risk hospitals overwhelmed (due vulnerable people vaccinated), need return normal. Cringe Yes flaws. testing viral RNA. Positive test mean infection

The cycle threshold (Ct) needed detect virus inversely proportional patient’s viral load. test results correspond clinical presentation, new specimen taken retested using different NAT 

According clinical correlation, test medicine older adults don’t want this. never asked young people them. government did... idea. saw comment they're saying 2022 probably bad 2020 ""varients"".

I worry people using term ""variant"" catch-all pessimism, matter much evidence vaccines still work ability update vaccines.

It's almost like people *want* pandemic continue. understand. Talk horrible headline. Good lord. endgame herd immunity vaccinations, not? difference they’re rush don’t haven’t hundreds thousands deaths day like countries.

And problems scenarios (which think others addressed before) “massive outbreak” hasn’t happened it’s year now, current lockdown, annoying, one state week. don’t get it. There’s shame getting sick. shouldn’t dent anyone’s “tough-guy” image.

Neither self-image, judgment people whose opinions concerned about, based rational evaluation. words people like intended audience Yes days new variants quickly gaining dominance inpatient outpatient? Mexico anyone? plenty exposure grade high school -- I'd say math science. focused critical thinking skills been. mostly focused rote learning facts knowledge. learn world, European, US history grade school high school, really taught interpret read lines take context.

We definitely need critical think skills back, again, part every single field knowledge, humanities. Floridian here, lockdown? That's awful idea, especially vaccinated.

I hate masks much next guy, *feeling* going magically make immune virus unable transmit it.

Vaccination that, feelings. wont know full effects 5-10 years saying illegal immigration is...illegal? shit.

If leaving country make happier, leave. Thousands people come US Europe ilegally everyday improve lives. life shit need leave America happy, fucking stop making excuses it. ""This seat belt efficiency rate 66%, I'm going wear one better one comes out."" That's basically saying. Oh didn’t know that. seems premature make statement like that, many reasons. Troubling, actually. LA Unified public school district? so, thought weren’t allowed require vaccine available EUA. check though... metal microchip.

Hospitals last place drop mask mandate, co-workers already resigned fact. Mine five nights freddys decals :D looking ""worst case scenario"" projection? surprising pessimistic... 

The ""projection"" ""variant spread"" predictions look lot reasonable. Yeah. I'm confused ""doom gloom"" media angle. We're almost half million death America alone. That's pretty fucking gloomy I'd say. know everyone ""over shit"" let's happy idiots. stupid you? 100million people day 1/3 US population. think palestinians would even fit west bank population rate? Take 3 seconds think speak Mussolini lmao. Perfect description ""don't buy masks, work"" again. vaccinated people going stop following measures enough people stop following public, whos gonna stop them?

They learned lol understand want thorough maintain confidence vaccine, alternative vaccines end safe effective children? know say assuming things! thousand ItWorks huns got really excited pyramid scheme cures covid. 

Then disappointed actually stuck inside 24/7 since March, anyways. never heard story. probably look like fucked vampire. Yes do. Long term? Google yourself. Troll. Source??? still follow public health guidelines (i.e. mask wearing/social distancing certain vaccination threshold met). Obviously elderly live-in relatives work around high risk populations cognizant too.

Why? likely heard Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine efficacy 95%, Moderna's 94% Johnson &amp; Johnson's 66%. numbers actually mean? Def pro wondering degree handling people infected yet symptomatic would be. I'm imagining might introduce certain additional margin error? too. think media seriously bungled vaccine messaging. :( Still plausible 100,000%. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

/s - hope goes without saying guess need mention first post sarcastic way real views, hopefully views anyone. Palestinian government refused help vaccinations. They're trying get Russian vaccines. always thought good idea tie either tax break stimulus check vaccine probably late. now, people already vaccine would left out, tracking them. central database vaccinated not. yeah, good job ethnic genociders! [Why Moderna say is? claim millions ""remotely plausible"". claim requires exceptional level ignorance, magnitude claiming ""remotely plausible"" 90% US population died WW2. tax reform taxes could lowered working class, raised rich deficite could paid back slightly next decades. Fixing issue mass inflation.

Spending big crisis paying back safe times helps economy. think mistaken. Australia ordered enough doses. Australia population around 25 million, ordered 10 million Pfizer, 53.8 million AZ (50 million made locally, 3.8 million made overseas), 51 million Novavax doses. [(Source)]( plan excess doses case one vaccines get approved. No, to. people gonna pissed angry see weirdo assume shitty reasons. Tell DNA 8% viral viruses *actually* change DNA - vaccines. (And even tiny cumulative effect generations automatically positive negative) steps taken? much spending? progress steps? give us detailed report efforts?

Hundreds millions Americans making massive sacrifices careers, relationships, mental health protect health care system.

I think unreasonable expect government, asking us make sacrifices, open transparent steps taking improve health care system we're sacrificing much for. Born 1988 :) Jokes you, separated host site 2 teams, separate bathrooms, eating facilities, etc. additional PPE required work areas forced mingle. half 500 person shift limited 8 toilet stalls they’re one end quarter mile long factory. piss breaks take half hour now, lol world without vaccine, going get Pox point, better young. mom got Pox 25, suffered greatly, miscarriage it. long time ago though. 20s, vaccine need suffer. still get shingles chickenpox vaccine much less likely. I'm sorry got shingles badly :( first off, anyone relies govt tell &amp; believe everything say true perfect naive

second, masks protect around you, yourself

third, 60% COVID cases asymptomatic dont even know contagious &amp; need wear mask, that's always wear one.

so basing decisions people tell clearly wrong every step pretty dumb Jerusalem Post article quotes statement PA Health Minister specifically said ask Israel's help sufficient.

It quote statement, claims JP informed anonymous official. even accurate, best outdated information. Every article linked here, including one month later author, shows Palestinians assuredly *do* want Israel's state PA working distribute vaccines, Israel.

""We working non-Israeli sources"" != ""We want Israel's help"". Israel refuses help them, supposed accept die? mean trial completely ignored T-cell immunity? Same. mom mid 70's, many friends relatives 70's 80's able get shots yet either, Michigan. call skeptical say April, six weeks away, available everyone. don’t lock doors either since burglar easily come window Go it! live getting Covid shot every year, there’s zero chance wear mask anywhere doesn’t mandate I’m fully vaccinated. one WANTS lockdown.

We see people forced work unsafe conditions. People restaurant industry America long history forced go sick various reasons, DESPITE laws made it. Teachers forced back schools vaccines made available, despite lack PPE basic supplies, despite disparate impact minority students.

We see irresponsible fucks going partying, famous people ignoring rules partying, pisses us off. millions people right thing, millions spreading disease pandemic. judge people right thing.

Laws matter people enforce them. laws harder enforce large part population wants whatever want without thinking greater good. I’m 64 years old I’m furious young people’s behalf. They’ve thrown bus every right feel resentful. I’m amazed haven’t risen en masse rebelled. color microchip get? want rose gold! Hey HEY bring logic fact house Ricky Bobby Wait, wait, want COVID intestines either! Send somewhere else! R C L L recorded smh wouldn’t even care people get paid take line part incentive get vaccine go back normal life, apparently that’s thing sooo appears normal life, she’s microbiologist Discussions covid precautions rife hypocrisy. ton people (many know personally) happy shame others social media even low-risk activities, time regularly engage activities shaming others for. 

Some blatant examples various government officials violated restrictions (e.g., Newsom's famous dinner party) people went beach last summer, posted pictures social media complaining crowded was. Explain detail dumb COVID. Give examples justification them. 

Go it. Explain dumb it. old you? really one relatively recently compared others. There's small movie theater near kind door bathrooms, place I've seen I've always thought neat.  father keeps telling wait home Biden’s comments convinced there’s point sheltering place another year.

I think it’s time try build life new normal. Watching Netflix day isn’t living. think argument insane.

We could save ~20,000-50,000 lives (in U.S. alone) every winter full, covid style lockdown.

We could save many banning unhealthy food/soda/alcohol giving government complete control diets.

We could save thousands reducing speed limits everywhere, freeways included 25mph. would take week get family members living across country, hey, cars pollute anyways people probably either.

**We things personal freedoms matter, too.** said race. Plenty Arabs getting vaccinated Israel Good! know lot people would feel exactly you, get it.

But want get many people vaccinated possible, something least looked at. probably politically unfeasible it'll piss lot people I'm certainly glad bought house prior pandemic. Massively inflating monetary supply contracting supply consumer goods services going one hell number housing prices next couple years. Setting expectation governments pump trillions new money economy diminished monetary velocity quite experiment.  businesses around back normal hours except grocery stores, close night. really miss making midnight grocery store runs.  know many people risk groups still get virus? E.g. 14 vaccinated (2x) German elderly tested positive British variant live work for? even needed...Covid problem young...In 20 years likely one many flu viruses go kid thats ok... many mild cases? Moderna positive test least 2 symptoms. highly unlikely Western governments going open borders travel year. working frenzy possible mutations vaccines guarantee 100% sterilizing immunity forced quarantine. agenda.

Any person state majorly pro lockdown general agenda sub past couple months. think projections take vaccines account, apparently they're assuming vaccines lot less effective variants mostly untrue comes deaths hospitalizations cool. look forward getting vaccine 2039! course ignorant — even cursory, superficial shallow understanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict, would immediately reveal figure ""millions"" completely nonsensical, utterly disconnected reality. cancelled, can’t.:-/ tickets July obviously cancelled rescheduled year. We’ll see happens. wouldn’t go though. never threatened overwhelm hospitals, silly ask PR rep. Yes. Efficacy 75% 2 doses (three months between) according last Oxford data exactly, know one person fully SIP except medical appts since march, person advanced cancer though well mental issues, count average citizen. Even ""stay home"" people know made exceptions things want important them. Lol. It’s surreal living Mississippi reading opening schools. went online April- June last year. year fully open club sports activities continued minor adjustments. Also teachers aren’t eligible vaccine yet unless fall risk group. Sometimes kinda forget rest US sane compared us. come thread ask every while, anyone heard US border restrictions loosening time soon? I'm Canadian living USA family Canada/Mexico seen since March since may let back US. shit's killing bad, lockdown forever Yeah people reason get focused prevent everything bother. lowering risk categories significantly that's point, even sterilizing (which might be, would lower transmission rate either way). fair treat like garbage would think that?  Piranha actually dangerous reputation implies. scavengers mostly leave humans alone. Honestly, wish could afford it. initially refuse cooperate. changed mind asked Israel help, Israel slowly giving: Prepare stupid illogical anti-vaxxer argument ""even one severe case death many."" Get Covid death rate math ready hit 'em hard it. sure mention US government pretty much bankrolled successful vaccine candidates billions taxpayer money. 

The Pfizer vaccine, developed German company BioNtech, far commonly administered vaccine US. received US funding, substantial amounts German funding. substantially prevent covid though. Name vaccine doesn’t. idea “we idea prevents transmission” goes everything know vaccines, early data pfizer moderna contradict idea too: data show reduction asymptomatic cases viral loads. 

Stop spreading idea terrible messaging. could vaccine prevent disease zero impact transmission? makes sense. like smallpox literally got argument someone like two weeks ago “first graders expected able get vaccine fall 2022” article came out.

So either exist I’m delusional schizophrenic I’m hallucinating. rather unlikely since I’m beyond age onset. Even accept premise Israel country full evil psychopaths

Doesn't full them. evil psychopaths wrong position need. statements redirected sympathy like ""We'll take care Palestine we've inoculated citizens"" hide disdain Palestine quite Furthermore, difficult believe Palestinian government refused Israeli help

""Calling Israel evil absurd anti-semitic, stretch believe Palestine's ineffective government letting people die virus PR"" people idiots.

And told. public.  admitted ""Europe slower strategy."" 

It's EU slower strategy, last time checked UK still Europe.... deflection misinformation Macron. Memorial day I'm burning masks **Can vaccinated people spread virus?**

Any answer get either ""yes"" ""no"" wrong, now. ""maybe, probably not"", going way long time.

In order answer question scientifically, would require ""challenge study"" vaccinated unvaccinated people deliberately exposed virus see transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns deliberate exposure prevent us performing studies humans. reason vaccine trials took long, can't deliberately infect people see need hospitalization die.

However, studies hamsters, results looked pretty bad. able spread it. hamsters greet touching noses like time. Humans really (do you?). similar studies monkeys results look really good.

Also, notice reputable person talking subject always says ""may able spread"", ""maybe"", ""we know if"". that's small chance vaccinated people able spread virus. big chance. Doctors, scientists, regulators careful language subject, would argue they're careful. said, say ""vaccinated people cannot spread virus"", find situations vaccinated people spread virus, would end worse hedge while. least me, way they're framing seems pretty reasonable, put shoes.

**Continued Above**

Looks like amount virus people who've gotten one dose Pfizer vaccine infected [greatly reduced compared heavy reduction ability spread virus.

Despite news, looks like least mRNA vaccines [*still* three worrying variants.

[This regarding efficacy vaccines [mRNA vaccines 100% SA variant, *doesn't* [mean we'll definitely need thought strategies get stragglers get jab.

Say September 2021, million people left vaccinate. gave $1 tax break getting vaccine 2021 taxes, would impact all?

I'm thinking overlap people fight get back every dollar government people may fence vaccine. convince antivaxxers, that's sure. want seem like paying people get vaccine. Whatever strategy use, needs symbolic cheap.

**Spike mutation analogy:**

The spike protein coded 3,831 base pairs. mean?

Well, like lego sculpture 3,831 words instructions build it, writer super-detailed explaining motion piece.  

In analogy, immune system makes lego pieces (antibodies) attach pair exposed bumps lego sculpture. We'll say 40 pairs exposed example.

A variant instructions change one words. Sometimes photocopier instructions page gets tiny smudge. could really bad sometimes, especially critical word phrase, like ""left"" ""repeat six times"" description particularly detailed lego piece. Color might always matter, size would.

Out 3,831 words, many change much every one 40 spots longer there? probably lot.

But wait, many words change make whole sculpture really different, work sculpture anymore? Really many they're right spots, right? variants suck viruses; rare mistake would make instructions *better*.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty minor.

**Booster questions think about, answers**

(note: there's difference ""boost"" ""booster"" needs understood.)

(also, what's term mixture sequences, heterogenous? doubt term overthinking?)

(also also, I'm convinced we're definitely going need boosters, fun think about.)

Could booster shot replace second dose prime/boost regimen?

Should booster shot use one sequence mRNA (or identical spike proteins), both/multiple?

For future vaccines, sequence/spike prime/boost different? four spikes/sequences, would make sense two each, four each?

How much trust mutation modeling here? anticipate future mutations include them? good enough yet?

Do need give non-booster doses people recovered infection?

Could ""stretch"" doses mRNA booster priming vaccine that's easier manufacture, maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), boost mRNA booster? Could better faster prime current mRNA sequence boost updated ChAdOx1? vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing infection, subsequent variant exposed broaden immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). they'll good broad immunity variety variants, seems likely indication catch spread virus well future. thing happens someone vaccinated exposed new variant. immunity broadened strengthened subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. remember, many people less likely spread virus, pretty unlikely reduced level spread sufficient sustain virus way seen past year. variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing mind changed new information though, take gospel.

Tips clarifying terms/language/understanding appreciated. miss something could help people? Please let know! got second shot yesterday. Zero symptoms first shot, today I'm feeling fatigue muscle aches. Self burn? downvoted? thought immunity lasted 3 months. would death toll numbers would cooked media wouldn’t care much Good them. extremely disappointed Israel yet shared vaccines Palestine communities. guess lives worth anything US close island nation Australia is

lol what?? hope schools/colleges open fall atleast, not, looks like deferring semester. # BACK NORMAL Believe they're 100% there. I've seen lot reddit.

The reason replied use ""billions"". would put us 40th deaths per capita, people would likely much less critical. 

It's lot easier ghoulish country top 10 worst world.  they're going shut investigation early cases October/November. Samples discarded scientific information lost. They'll blame importation via fomite transmission know basically happen. investigation animal reservoirs around Wuhan all. They'll happy conspiracy theories lab release since easy distraction dismiss. draftsman trade say certainty blueprints plans definition execution... understand still basing cases. Given vaccine excellent reducing hospitalizations, goal always overwhelm hospitals, CDC criteria based hospitalizations only. cares substantial transmission hospitalizations low? sounds like UK government’s attempt cover fact COVID strategy failure.

I dont even understand teachers arent considered essential workers. thought children future. documented thru test scores virtual learning hurting children academically addition many issues. go every thread ranting raving bad things are

That's **they are**. We're something like 48th falling vaccination rates - FACT.  personally attack want, IDGAF, change fact Canada, Justin Trudeau, failed *miserably* comes procuring vaccines, costing us lives - FACT.  Remember people actually cared ""grandma dying"" that? Funny goes window Trudeau fault. Pfizer Moderna defined case least one symptom (however mild) positive COVID-19 test. Johnson &amp; Johnson defined ""case"" positive COVID-19 test plus least one moderate symptom 

Why tf government holding scientific standard? 

An asymptomatic case biggest load bs ever hopefully approve J&amp;J AZ vaccines soon, distribute general public late Spring. principle. I'd kind like idea, lol. sure China really cares proving innocent Reddit/4chan/etc? say that! Sheesh! Yay! sure fully agree Lockdown summer straight happening. Well several times said different.

Vaccines likely reduce spread disease. we're patient, hang months majority American adults get vaccinated, significantly slow spread go back normal.

There's need put things conflict cake eat little patience (I'm talking summer 2021 becoming widely available, 2022 anything) Yeah that's even time school. Israelis definitely killed many many Palestinians. said, get estimates? 100mil/day - 1mil/day - million ever quite range, no? Because... studies enough give EUA vaccines FDA include information whether vaccine actually stops transmission virus. terms scientific rigor, know yet. CDC may additional information, may tracing spread areas done wide inoculations, may working information available general public. Well, asked legitimate question got legitimate answer. I’m really sure he’s expecting honest. I’m praying people’s behavior changes gets warmer get back normal life spring summer, there’s going point (probably couple weeks vaccines fully available all) I’m going outright refuse wear mask social distance unless I’m school. We’re good place, I’m hoping gets nicer people actually want get lives. don’t want drawn even long already been, goalposts moved “anyone get vaccine” I’m complying all. Pfizer money, accept government. want say thank protecting family. amount people won’t boggling. don’t mean folks need put kids daycare keep roof heads. 

My neighbors work home couldn’t resist introducing newborn family friends first days guess what—they Covid baby 5 weeks old. Dad briefly hospitalized they’ve recovered, knows affect kid’s health rest life. It’s infuriating watching parents reckless children, garner sympathy they’re sick. feel little relief every time hear sensible people like you. feds made perfect sense.

All vaccine infrastructure *always* state, county, city level U.S. Forever always. Trying duplicate would disaster.

And lying ""just shipped states."" feds compelled states develop vetted plans distribution. feds' fault individual healthcare workers took holidays off. point responsibility moves federal executive offices. didn't, there'd need millions government employees trillions dollars taxation. Make America Dumb go slower, things actually happen faster? mean, maybe.  idea reminds similarly paradoxical idea locking hard would lead reopening faster. experience, true: San Francisco's lockdowns lead lockdowns, Georgia's reopening lead reopening. Maybe live, fact younger people tend liberal (which, like not, strong correlation people's positions NPIs US), experience too. Older people know anti-lockdown, younger ones (under 30) much pro-lockdown pro zero-covid strategies.  Dae like lockdowns? Upvotes plz country shit. wonder behind scenes plans government pay people get vaccine come July, whenever vaccine demand falls way off.

I get would wildly unpopular already vaccinated people would hate it, want many people vaccinated possible, offering 50 bucks otherwise go way get might pretty dang helpful. ""Cause numbers game suck math, shut get vaccine stop showing everybody ignorance."" That’s actually good French politician: try link graphic shows average approval rating since Charles de Gaulle that’s even better showing historical approval ratings. shows can’t always compare ratings 2 different cultures hope somethings stay good, like many office jobs able telework governments actually cleaning public transit stations. Oh EU government also blame. USA sure America first this. know trust partner anymore. Yup. extra level hate also aimed anyone public healthcare option. public health figures keep saying they've evidence does.

It's approved purpose yet, can't legally say does. get first next week! school worker excited! wondering, think people category fair regards “return normal?” I’m later 20s working public sine August, honest, get paranoia fear order job. I’m quite concerned people group (young wfh) terms rejoining society. friends tell don’t want people homes it’s bubble willing isolate indefinitely seem enjoy exclusivity pods. don’t mean rude way all, feel like many people like Oxford/Astrazeneca one wasn't, Pfizer vaccine different vaccine appears suffer problems. good friend mine probably little paranoid begin like this. Late 2020 saying vaccines 2022 2023. announced said approved. approved, said safe effective. course latched onto variants, said variants would worse ""just like Spanish Flu"" would evade vaccines. he's saying people take vaccines. goes.

It's uphill battle. guess ok nutty paranoid friend different story media says people take fact otherwise persuaded can't bothered look actual data. 200,000 lowest possible death rate.

And highest predicted death rate 3,000,000.

The current 495,000 figure way closer best-case worst-case scenario.

Huh. still 4k deaths day US almost 50 million people shot? understand people haven’t fully vaccinated thought first dose supposed help significantly. communicated test phase, legitimate release vandidate. Honestly, hard understand? either troll moron. happy news!!! country good headline ""less 1k deaths week"", getting exposed virus lot, vaccine fucking works bro. say 2 weeks second shot 5.5 first would definitely good Pfizer half week shy moderna Possible, yes. 

The 2/3 get obviously can't transmit it.

Of 1/3 do, likely average lower viral load, contagious less time. numbers, someone goes walk 2 mph hour, someone goes run 6 mph two hours exercised, runner done 6 times work walker may apply transmission virus - there's less about, less time. Ummm..pretty sure scientists agree based ability vaccinate, number people refusing vaccinate etc country systematically denies vaccines entire race irony refuse wear mask impinges freedoms lost important freedoms us. Thanks too. know ignorance illiteracy rampant Janssen already tested South Africa, 57% effective much better 10% Astrazeneca one. Moderna shipments got cut, info already misleading/out date. living constant fear getting deadly virus...

Lol guys seriously think rest world living fear day day basis? wonder people willing tolerate insane restrictions.. really brainwashed.

Fun fact: rest us living lives guys. difference us live constant fear next lockdown, also need ask government ""permission"" leave country. near-zero risk dying flu still get flu shot every year. sure point is... know lol. amount weight I’ve gained quite concerning. Israel much ahead. UK finished reaching target offering first shot 70. takes weeks immunity build up(that first week still vulnerable). Although settling roadmap lockdown later month. Good know! Thanks Moderna still reassuring Canada hit Q1 target.

Mmmhmmm....both Pfizer Moderna missed shipments week week week...but yeah, they'll totally make next 6. Despite childish inability look facts statistics, worry, I'm sure count peddle misleading information face reality. forgot ""/s"" Reddit literally wants lock forever. That's honestly I'm getting this. even know sterilizing every time bring cases falling etc, points providing sterilizing immunity, get downvoted oblivion. Yeah.. don’t think masks going anywhere anytime soon hospital. Especially icu settings. Perhaps messages link original. Lol, check post history. It’s pretty evident say am. German socialist living Spain. dislike Russian government every socialist should. mean problem Russia people. majority like everyone else want good life. 6 took note teacher written crayon paper bag tried pass mom wrote it.

The sharpie incident equivalent grown man did.

And president Untied States. Even open full starts passed large groups kids mutating? dont know. top 0 clue long term risks play everything. makes anxious.
 
Thank insight though. kids? Yes. thread specifically US. past couple months certain government officials media outlets pushing narrative still spread virus getting vaccine, can't anything differently vaccinated. However, significant evidence vaccine greatly reduces chance transmitting virus (as expected), changing messaging. Even Fauci said vaccinate people soon take less precautions - ""What's reason get vaccinated first place, want get normal?"" said. "" Fauci, cautious conservative public voice ever, said guidelines going relaxed, going relaxed. one yelling! dick Australia new Zealand tremendous advantages locking cases numbers already low, virus seeded spread throughout much Europe US knew existed. vast majority Americans, unfortunately, support lockdowns well mean look deaths per capita numbers. USA's sandwiched Italy, Bosnia &amp; Portugal Hungary them. Belgium's world's worst hit major country (since Gibraltar San Marino essentially cities). 

A 40% reduction USA deaths puts per capita deaths 1466 880 puts Netherlands, Austria &amp; 15% higher Germany seems pulled one best reactions densely-populated European nation. seems right far 'best case policy scenario' Mortality decline? they're becoming gods? makes perfect sense operate assumption government always right. Source? Canadas roll painfully alow hopefully picks coming weeks Thanks article, helps concerns. 😊  Right I'd rather Australia New Zealand vaccines North America Europe vaccines rolling out. get there, enjoy relative freedom meanwhile. clear good news: given lessons address anti-vaccine movement, lessons contain anti-vax content headline suggests. Better nothing, I'm pretty sure everyone hoping Pfizer shot. set get vaccine February 22. either Pfizer Moderna. anyone know immunity COVID kicks sooner one vaccines other? Like know receive Pfizer, would get second dose 3 weeks opposed Moderna’s 4 week interval. 

Also, five half weeks first vaccine, pretty immune? set quarantine, get tested, visit family Easter weekend. also insist everyone get PCR tests rather rapid antigen tests? thing’s bit bullshitty Although tbf guys seem relatively safe terms covid. Little community spread IIRC? Although surprised guys start vaccinations asap vaccine developed Germany, German tax money. USA nothing it. mistake Germany let BioNtek partner Pfizer without making sure EU gets it’s fair share vaccines. getting doses per capita USA country benefits money gave BioNtek develope vaccine. vast majority Australia New Zealand support respective governments approach. Americans Europeans hundreds thousands deaths. seem think ok. Whether enemy invaded lungs invaded Poland, emerged victorious. true. rushed mean shorter usual. explained gave 2nd dose 3/4 weeks without even trying something like booster 3/4 months instead. It’s seen booster 3/4 months May effective, didn’t time test initially. Maybe read listen :) comparing US deaths G7 averages. Helps fucking read article.
