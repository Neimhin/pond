I‚Äôll look guess I'm aware. see second prolonged spike I'd inclined believe later cases likely result pandemic stands I'm inclined believe first surge result greater time parenting one's children. say obese people overwhelmingly clog hospital systems irresponsible life choices? fact, many hospitalizations covid obese people. Also colleges require vaccination masks kind confusing me.

If wear mask confirmed 100% vaccinated group people stop? Well.. yeah, right... still gonna die without hospital bed.

It interest get unvaccinated vaccinated keep COVID rates low till contain spread.  make light situation, use classic response ""thoughts prayers"" many politicians use national tragedy. poster comment implying people feel like part (i.e. people vaccinated feel like take part mitigation efforts) somehow responsible lack beds.

They aren't. Wearing mask prevent getting car crash.

The people responsible hospitals filling people unvaccinated. Vaccinated people practice risk mitigation risk already extremely mitigated account getting vaccine. rate doesnt need family friends change mind. Florida already lost people lead last election. say obese people? overwhelmingly clog hospital systems due irresponsible life choices.   Schools opening. absolute disaster generation. Stay safe everyone. Vid rampant right unreasonable one group 100 it. Glad hear good news coming Brazil seperated loved ones ability see extraordinary agonizing. long proper measures taken issues. Closing border unnecessary extreme taken last resort. Covid going everlasting issue there's reason keep borders closed further. Tam came said Canada faces fourth wave delta would due domestic travel vaccinated Americans pose threat Canadian health.  path normalcy always high vaccination rates *nationwide* US country currently high vaccination rates. war changed army got cocky. Moderna mamis papis come truuuuu Florida DoH tweeted numbers new daily case counts Florida currently posted CDC COVID Tracker incorrect. current listing states 28,317. accurate data follows:  August 6: 21,500  August 7: 19,567  August 8: 15,319  3 day average: Waiting Delta Decaffinated. Yep, husband trying convince parents 70s mask booster available. One is, others can't stop going restaurants 3x week think golden. guy one best balanced analysts

Please please please true moved Texas East Coast early 2020 pandemic. thankful every goddamn day.  Hey man cappuchinos legit  study simply highlighting mask efficacy poorly studied. literally says conclusion:

""It important construe absence evidence effectiveness evidence absence effectiveness. lack evidence supporting effectiveness facemasks, similarly lack evidence supporting ineffectiveness. information currently available, would imprudent recommend removal facemasks surgery."" like ""incivility"" allowed, post replying saying ""let die,"" remains, along another 15 posts suggest unvaccinated deserve die. totally get it. I'm considered essential also. fucking come right now. know 10 FULLY VACCINATED PEOPLE covid right now. Do. Not. Come. think holding breath worried employees would sue. Guess it‚Äôs safe say shit starting get biblical  kinds wrong

1.) average time FDA approval 12 years. Skipping lab work gold sticker something would proving skeptics‚Äô point. 

2.) MASSIVE ADA cutouts actually make unvaccinated defendable argument termination. Trying fire someone getting vaccine legally argued firing woman getting pregnant. saying won‚Äôt tested really bad law trying defend it. (Eugenic arguments US used sterilize poor women without consent, test drugs black people law allowing Japanese internment). We‚Äôre people talking variant completely vaccine resistant Sunday? yet, know single person (under age 60) measles.

Because live somewhere measles endemic generations ones bore brunt crisis. situation may case grandchildren, generation. part I‚Äôm confident almost big schools announced requirement it.

Seems young children high risk catch can‚Äôt get vaccine. Genuinely confused horribly worried. peace mind, 85 yo obese, heart attack survivor grandpa got Pfizer March. got covid two weeks ago (very likely Delta, 90% cases here). 

It sniffle. He's completely fine. obviously better get covid all, dad vaccinated, stress much. I'd bail. tempt fate. bad there. Two family members went Florida vacation. got Covid, hospitalized, one dead. sounds like survive breakthrough case, risk long haul Covid restaurant meal. Might want run r/COVID19 daily. wonder consider persistent symptoms that's different outcomes viruses flu. endgame just... learn live it, focus policy action makes possible LIVE IT.

Amen! lot countries coming around that, US seems bizarre state denial.  seems rhyme lot doesn‚Äôt it? read 2nd kicked ass first likely prior, since first introduction Covid body know fight yet.. 2nd time immune system learned reacts. first much worse, might already exposed. Isn‚Äôt state wanted secede? Funny thing is. haven‚Äôt even touched tip iceberg covid affects people long term. learning new things every month.

Plus, someone intubated due pneumonia pre-Covid? Trust me, I‚Äôd booster weekly even side effects order keep repeating experience. Definitely recommend intubation avoid it. Luckily, vaccines extremely preventative that! won‚Äôt care. don‚Äôt care. gone. Evidence suggests children school, physically less active much longer screen time, environmental risk factors studied, increased outdoor time consistently shown protective role development Collective efforts taken prevent worsening myopigenic behaviour counteract jeopardisation existing myopia control policies.

Except fire department charge arson, manslaughter anyone dies. think fed ultimately stepped behalf Californians state wouldn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt act. Lol said exact thing March! necessarily, Provincetown cases, viral load nasal swabs identical vaccinated unvaccinated, according CDC

Those nasal swabs PCRs, PCR measures viral RNA come from... dead viral particles, active virus. Even CDC said Ct values equal viral Ct values obtained SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR diagnostic tests might provide crude correlation amount virus present sample **can also affected factors viral want protect kid though. eligible vaccine yet. hilarious america thought pandemic going end made trump administration failure charge dementia biden   Hospitals Texas saturated many Texans failed get vaccinated and/or wear masks, though. elected leader actively work *against* COVID precautions, ask outside help preventable swell COVID cases, pretty bad move. Especially leader stopped working precautions. Well, Land Texas, believe Freedum Liberty shit. don‚Äôt hold Government regulation shit. 

/s school start major school systems. We're strapping bumpy ride. id rather live florida wear facemask failed vaccine Theres like 4 billion people havent vaccinated. Lots warm bodies covid experiment hearts content Lockdowns won‚Äôt anything. need get people vaccine. hope he‚Äôs right. guy pretty reliably right throughout entire duration pandemic. could see would last wave (increasing vaccination, natural immunity, kids getting vaccinated soon), also seemed like completely June. Time tell. Perhaps something share anyone one speaks ‚Äòbut death rates lower old people die anyway‚Äô crowd. intense immune response likely, since vaccine deaths general statistically insignificant. Higher levels 'side effects' good thing case since means higher level protection. I'll trade 1 really shitty day avoid weeks hell possibly life long issues major organs day. year boss running around campaigning one starting fires, gets understandably difficult, even that‚Äôs duty. would certainly come help another state without doubling salary, least. 2nd shot significantly worse, still able work slept got home. significant pressure headache presented 18 hrs shot lingered another 18.

VA paying ass anthrax vaccine understand made mandatory yet. know bases last heard commander 40% fully vaccinated extreme resistance unvaccinated. point makes mad I've arguments poeple year fucking clowns even want wear mask much less take shots. I've shown excess deaths charts, 99% people dying unvaccinated, simply dismiss fake news. Sorry ranting complete lack empathy worn down.  meant current wave. common estimates there's 5-10x amount coronavirus cases recorded. 5x, would around 180million people who've Covid US. We're 70% Americans vaccine now, really much room left virus run through.

I'm guy whose spent much free time looking though, take lol. Masks officially back indoor settings live. can‚Äôt help feel like it‚Äôs performative nonsense won‚Äôt much slow transmission, vaccination high won‚Äôt stop people unmasked gatherings going restaurants. really feels like we‚Äôre never going see end restrictions. feel like we‚Äôre weeks away business closures again. end game? every time new variant takes hold? enough enough? I'm feeling like you-- questioning sanity/reality bit, I'm seeing completely counter narratives: vaccines perfect, WORK advertised VS. current surge way worse realize even vaccinated people getting left right. 

The logical side brain telling worry I'm already double vaxxed, COVID before, live county relatively high vaxx rates, wherever go public, see 95% people masked.

The anxious/illogical side brain telling completely avoid gym anything indoors without distancing (bars, restaurants, etc) stay home hunker weeks.

As compromise, I'm avoiding gym LOL.

FWIW COVID late 2019 even knew boy nearly kill me... mean pretty much every scientific based article here‚Äôs one many: want hurt others. brag it. Schools already shitshow opened. It‚Äôs going bloodbath Yeah, person definitely reading 17 comment trainwreck discussion report reply 45 seconds made it. Lmao. sad little man.  Lockdowns work though. Done early enough people supported This. got diagnosed rare condition last March, day non-Essential surgeries shut down. pain suffering year figured wrong me. However condition would kill painful. wait several months already suffering year. Screw selfish people won‚Äôt get vaccinated. hurt us themselves. Poorer countries even vaccinating teenagers think completely valid feel do. hard threads opinion different masses. seems one wants look others experience knee jerk reaction ‚Äúanti-vaccine‚Äù don‚Äôt agree point view. It‚Äôs sad someone like valid feelings sharing real information would helpful bashing someone. husband 5 minute significant seizure vaccine (not Covid). stop intramuscular injection. never seizure never one since. testing afterwards limitations allowing drive work overwhelming. Nothing found testing would caused seizure outside vaccination. gets ton grief refusing get Covid vaccine. believe old enough know risks willing risk Covid avoid risks vaccine future. thought contagious reading isn‚Äôt. Ding Ding Ding. find ecnomical solution pandemic least societal impact?

The countries least negative economic impact ones adopted zero-covid approaches strict lockdowns response  again: 90% vaccination delta variant would still spreading unless borders closed down. virus never eradicated. Even human hosts vaccinated planet virus still mutate spread animals. didnt actually, makes sense someone else youre clearly lie. public health opt / opt situation, absolute wretch idiot And?! It‚Äôs insane believe states problems. vote urge others vote, voter suppression gerrymandering do? must simplistic world view blame us enough blame go around. getting line duty death benefits. Can't fix stupid pay stupidity. still think lockdowns/capacity restrictions/gathering bans non-starter point even people took/take pandemic seriously (the ones stayed home last year got vaccinated), really curious happen ICU's filled we're back triage thanks 90% cases taking ICU room willingly unvaccinated COVID patients. Don‚Äôt let Covid dominate life. /s Silly Reddit, science matter anti-vaxxers Don‚Äôt dare put us majority Texans vote madman

Your state literally known taking shit. Fucking something it, then. reported child can't fact sifted like 300 reddit posts 7 months cherry pick bullshit totally different situation position supported CDC. Interacting someone life situation depressing anyway. Black teacher Texas, yes, understand many people work throughout lockdowns continue one lol. poorer (still paying back student loans) worse access health care (I never come close reaching even half deductible year). 

There thing lockdown people like me. involves virtual school, provisions less fortunate students teachers afford equipment bandwith need virtual school, nationalized health care system, permanent significant raises critical in-person workers, regular monthly payments citizens families provide childcare, rent, mortgage. 

But would bad stock market, current administration proven serve devotedly predecessor. rent/eviction crisis neither party wants give people enough money forestall outcome. 

Why?

Because people get minimum amount support government, begin realize pitiful wages comparison refuse work pittances \*\*unless forced to\*\*.

The reason see stimulus drive current administration reason behind refuses ""follow scientists"" lock down: would support empower American worker, however fractionally, ensuing adjustment terms industrial wage demands would crater stock market. 

There electoral solution situation. cannot vote largely voted it. now, 2022, 2024. 

Thoughts? believe Biden ""exceeding expectations"", left-most member Democratic Party said him? Ah, see. let's make one public! think side effects diff huge deal, think example try shape public opinion rather give facts beginning. 

I think sabotage trying control ""narrative"" much. lie, downplay certain things insist ""there evidence"" early evidence indicates wind blowing bad direction. Eventually truth comes anti-vaxxers seize previous spin evidence inconsistent say can't trusted. think going happen next 5-10 years? Eventually us contracted covid, magically going disappear. Ideally better medication vaccination regimes don‚Äôt get sick it‚Äôs inevitable ending saga. Agree points. N95 thing would anything useful, never see everyone n95s. I‚Äôm seeing people tesco paper towels used masks.

I opposed mandates simply benefits masks practally mandated outweigh consequences. Many consequences unseen most. Let tell two family. 1st: kindergarten aged son. pretty severe ADD. unable wear mask day. It‚Äôs going stay on. make mandate requires mask school, fall behind, him, remote learning never work. 2nd: 5 autistic cousins. literally piss floor something environment changes. can‚Äôt handle deviation routine. Constant meltdowns. can‚Äôt wear masks. cases, fly reason, 100% know would multi thousand dollar federal fine, would probably get booted airport even got plane, adult autistic cousins case, could actually handcuffed arrested. 

Serious covid preventable outcome high risk groups vaccine. Hospitals treat unvaccinated covid last priority, fill reduce standard care patients. Lock downs delay inevitable future spread. Although r0 falls significantly start lockdown, stabilizes 1 dense areas, take soon let again. thing accomplish besides temporary reprieve, increase poverty. Covid never leave earth. learn live thing.

One thing think wrong due terminology. don‚Äôt think n95 kn95 differ manufacturing standards. think n95s elastic wrap around head, kn95s go around ears. N95s effective though. know CDC estimates since 2010, ***flu-related*** hospitalizations among children younger 5 years old ranged 7,000 26,000 per year United States?

So everyone goes freaking covid children, lets  mcg refer mRNA. nanolipids take lot mass. Now, mRNA formulations different they're comparable like 30/100 = 30%, know that. case recently. Patients tested upon admit reported vax. working FL Epi since 6-2020. review records interviews/contact tracing. lived Orlando summer. worst lightning I‚Äôve ever seen! Great shopping, though. Better Tampa Bay. 

Even people may piling inside Tampa Bay Piney Point spill made red tide lot worse would otherwise. beaches south Tampa Bay Sarasota areas still gross, though understand situation improving. LOL maybe that's Marine CPTs get qualified OERs course dos. guy claiming 150 million Americans Covid, another 150 vaccinated. Here‚Äôs question, depreciation efficacy indicative Pfizer wanes faster. simply Pfizer works poorly Delta variant became prevalent later on. saying ptw41845's friend liar yeah sounds super fishy. Also officer punching junior enlisted SM? Maybe NCO I'd buy LOL I'd feel like officer NCOs would something say it. Imagine salary withheld want take safety precautions.  Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

I'm sure media constantly telling ""completely, utterly ignorant science, medicine, logic instead rely myth, fantasy, heresay, conspiracy basis life choices"" make jump get vaccinated. think common misconception masks they‚Äôre designed protect wearer, case although fair governments haven‚Äôt clearly communicated public view.

Face masks designed filter breathe out, breathe in. Face masks aren‚Äôt designed protect you, they‚Äôre designed protect around you.

Think surgeons always needed wear face masks. It‚Äôs protect breathing anything open body, it‚Äôs don‚Äôt breathe spit anything open body. masks don‚Äôt work wear them? Here's methodology: population figures Economic Research Service United States Department Agriculture. Percentage people fully vaccinated Centers Disease Control Prevention, Virginia Department Health Texas Department State Health Services, accessed 7/28/21. Massachusetts Department Public Health lists Barnstable County 70% fully vaccinated. Least vaccinated county determined CDC data 7/28 counties 20,000 residents. 2020 county-level election results New York Times election results page. Poor phrasing part. 

Masks clearly least somewhat effective, though I'd suggest still great data quantifying *how* effective real world situations. 

We RCTs observational studies can't really disentangle impact masks impact interventions/behavioral changes. ([Here's one lit concludes masks effective acknowledges limitations current research). I'm open seeing research good job disentangling results, seen yet.

fwiw, seems CDC assumes masks 20-30% efficacy personal protection 40-60% efficacy source control ([slide though differentiate b/w different types masks provide sources estimates

Masks relatively low-cost intervention, costless. such, would really nice better, precise estimates efficacy weigh pros/cons policies mask mandates moral thing sending vaccines abroad valid US already ordered 200 million Pfizer shots boosters children. 100 percent children get vaccine that‚Äôs 100 million around 100 million boosters. 

But either way brings total shots we‚Äôve ordered Pfizer 500 million 210 million already supplied. we‚Äôve already paid lot shots whether use lot boosters not. 

Plus near future demand way behind supply Pfizer‚Äôs shots. agree - would even extend poorer countries. People need see efficacy putting forward legitimate worthy candidates consistently‚Ä¶especially local elections. let alone amazingly easy debunk? 
what happens trying disprove negative. 

for every lie, half truth, misrepresentation disproved, three pop up. cycle continues. Masks save lives prevent disease, dress codes limit children‚Äôs freedom expression. One makes sense appease conservative asshats. US, get one right want to. Lol, think covid infection confers zero natural immunity? need educate yourself. work FL Epi Covid. Hospitalization absolutely admitted PICU‚Äînot d/c ED visit. Higher ups Tallahassee also second check reported data. info that‚Äôs reported paints rosy picture vs actual #s. safe! you‚Äôre looking sign get shot, is. efficacy figures. guess July important place look Delta dominant (70%). Definitely wide confidence intervals 75-80% efficacy hospitalization then. encouraging. important thing endgame here. can‚Äôt like restrictions oh I‚Äôm sorry restrictions back

If endgame wanted us live like another year , they‚Äôre underestimating people getting pissed course GOP science denying representative respond state.  dead. second dose moderna trip.

Anything point. Look hopeful back April/May look us now? too, took three days feel better though. third shot required get another jab, absolutely. Oral therapeutic drugs going help end it.

Pretty sure survey data though, validity that, blah. still pretty big difference, even self reporting. covid vaccination? Well, people wearing masks big overlap people getting vaccinated. Wonder many dishonorable discharge they'll issue. Sure many idiots take DH, screw future instead taking easy vaccine.  I‚Äôm going Miami long weekend weekend. best friend getting married wants go nice restaurant one night. plan trying wear mask everywhere indoors bail? I‚Äôm vaccinated healthy 32 yr old.

Jesus Christ Quittin time russia  reminds pipe allowed burst except state authority state orders tries burst cut funding would flee Oh, heard anything that. I'm particularly worried, I'll antibody test days none guess I'll see then. Two months ago, Arizona 600 daily cases. Today, theyre 4x that.

Heres genius we've restrictions months (jumped gun) metrics budged, they've gone anything. Every surge happened much faster, much restrictions place. feel like sitting duck all. Feels immune. seems foolish totally ignore entire aspect natural immunity look vaccination rates exclusively trying figure places vulnerable we've probably somewhere mid-100s million infections country.

I've arguing number weeks now, even metrics started cratering, due availability highly effective vaccines ever growing body science showing us good stopping infection preventing spread. metrics also dropping like rock top that, adults country eligible vaccination entire month (and slowest areas, plenty states open eligibility 2 months now), would think pretty damn obvious start getting lives back normal. variants!"" - think crazy let worried variants can't move this. seen zero credible reason believe need wear mask situation fully vaccinated individual. low incidence covid area, low likelihood catch vaccinated, low likelihood spread catch it, low likelihood anyone give going actually bad illness... longer really worry hurting anyone via coronavirus. wrong then, youre still wrong. entire account could pasted ""agedlikemilk"" 

Delete account. Many countries approved mixing shots first second dose. extremely similar Ah thank info. serious side effects terms causing death hospitalization? ""serious"" side effects mean longer severe periods fever, aches, energy, etc? nit pick word looking exacerbate. Keep mind, reddit healthy (lol) shut-in population. hit truck assholes taken al beds countries allowed different ones two ones depending available american, impression community service standard sentence there. want get vaccinated woukd guess picking rubbish roadside would tge alternative (or watch many films could also be)

It's probably thing actually like american system... Guard: ‚ÄúNo coughing!‚Äù  Moderna here. felt mostly nothing first worried didn‚Äôt produce strong immune response I‚Äôm told that‚Äôs true. arm pain body aches etc. maybe felt like mentally slight fever 3 hours night (round 2) woke fine. Despite feeling stoned ever slightly hot touch, still cracking jokes dancing around house. hope body responded strongly nonetheless! nervous that.

 wife knocked 12 hours. Body aches. Fever. Chills. Terrible arm pain. can‚Äôt imagine actual Covid would like considering immune system seems revved average. I‚Äôm tired weasel words adult vaccinations. hasn‚Äôt harder time kid long long time. adults need grow up. results in, fast typically start distributing vaccine? GIVE FREEDOM, GIVE DEATH!!!!

Looks like 2021 2 1 sale. 

For me, I've chosen vax living life healthy can. Efficacy hospitalization (as determined network clinics/hospitals) would also distorted lots mild/asymptomatic vaccinated people going doctor.

Countries like Israel Singapore lot contact tracing testing plus mandatory Covid tests flu-like symptoms pick lot vaccine breakthroughs, proportion hospitalized lower. Singapore's data past 28 days (essentially Delta essentially Moderna/Pfizer) shows 90% efficacy severe two-dose vaccine still works well preventing people getting seriously sick, demonstrating 88% effectiveness hospitalization 91% effectiveness severe illness, according Israeli data published calculations:

99.942% Americans covid infection requiring hospitalization. 

Hospitalizations: 192143
US Population: 331,449,281 (2020 Census) I'll first line ready. lost get go, small slice big pie still huge number. Yeah, keep thinking student years ago gave asthma inhaler another student attack. (Also TX)

The school suspended them. can‚Äôt parents decide what‚Äôs best case, too? mean rules regulations parents know best? (For record, disagree school‚Äôs decision asthma inhaler situation. I‚Äôm offering another  Bullshit left again. 99.942% Americans covid infection requiring hospitalization. 

Hospitalizations: 192143
US Population: 331,449,281 (2020 Census) kind logic this? Usually repeated actions happen work. can't help countries can't control 99.942% Americans covid infection requiring hospitalization. 

Hospitalizations: 192143
US Population: 331,449,281 (2020 Census) Read science friend. vaccine designed alpha version prevent others infecting people ALPHA coronavirus. DELTA variant little different Alpha version. vaccine still protects 99 ish % folks dying going hospital it‚Äôs good preventing someone vaccinated spreading carrier. Hence cdc reinstated mask
Recommendations. 

The data came vaccines effective preventing severe health outcomes, they‚Äôre effective preventing someone delta variant giving another person. science nutshell, friend. Nothing ever static, new information comes adjust based numbers telling you. fluid situation. say difference unvaccinated vaccinated people peak stupidity. SIL RN Canada. 8 months pregnant working ER. Even though Canadian government told get jab refuses claiming could hurt baby doesn‚Äôt want take risk. told exposing covid know far worse anything covid could her, whole family, spouse included got upset me. also take nursing. also insisting baby shower 50 guests‚Ä¶ Honestly I‚Äôm pretty certain she‚Äôs anti vax using child excuse vaccinate ( getting pregnant said didn‚Äôt trust vaccine) health care workers smart comes this. still biases beliefs. Elimination critical since can‚Äôt control something spreads exponentially without getting spread zero. New Zealand it. China Australia successfully long time again. see mindset coming from... Thanks sharing. Imma dip there's sense continuing this. FDA built speed. set deliberate imagine would happen don‚Äôt thoroughly test dosage serious problem. would world hurt rushed vaccine killed covid would have. Imagine anti-vaxxers that. get ya. Hoping it‚Äôs approved kiddos soon feel better sending back school.  plans postponed

Have now? hanging buddies weekend (all vaccinated, outside FWIW) talking. 

Out 8 us there, I'm one remote pre COVID. One told remote least 2022. One heard anything either way going back office.

The six, work different companies told returning office September 7th. companies going back 100% office. state around 45-50% vaccinated depending source. numbers also say every hospital county ICU beds full right now.

Plus school starting back either week next depending school. person.

This going get much much worse really really soon. Liberals aren‚Äôt morons deny science know they‚Äôre happening now. hardly happened people actually cared pandemic. everyone wants one vaccinated. chance lockdowns come back. Thanks link. definitely take time read that. hope one day US Koreans MERS truly examine things went wrong fix things.

I flew Feb. 20, 2020 Daegu. previous week large outbreak city thanks ""patient 20"". Due contact tracing able stop outbreak weeks. 

When flew Seattle like night day. Koreans sanitizing stations everywhere well messaging airport. US international airport nothing. one wife wearing masks. 

The questions US immigration asked China farm. it. nothing possible symptoms, nothing quarantining ourselves. numbers given case fell I'll. wonder spread states fast. Majority unvaccinated, still unfortunate amount individuals hospitalized vaccinated. statistics awesome, that's still hundreds vaccinated individuals hospital. Dozens deaths. Compared tens thousands unvaccinated! still. Floriduhhh said problem ""promptly detected eliminated within 30 40 minutes"" rest patients transferred ""oxygen cylinders backup oxygen sources.

How sad took 30 mins realize problem. certainly think oxygen failure going here.  I‚Äôm happy you. wish people would realize importance go get shots. Get tested see doc right away though. doesn‚Äôt even make sense, people started getting vaccinated December, still president. It‚Äôs like vaccines changed new president sworn in. wish extended schools. kept 12 son home 17 months exposed whatever school employees feel like getting vaccinated.  I'm just...not going plan anything. miracle things improve it'll spur moment kind trip. Maybe Maybelline. hey, don‚Äôt lump us needle phobia weirdo. i‚Äôm terrified still got it‚Äôs right thing üò§  apply pilots? know union might cause issue. experience took moderna dose 2 Yet Abbott still won‚Äôt allow schools mandate masks potentially fine schools $1,000 impose mandates. 

Page  forget NIH data shows ""imperfect vaccines""- pathogen allowed survive within host, spread others, actually accelerates virulence towards lethality-- I‚Äôm surprised Austin one copying Dallas time!  300? someone verify this? seems surprisingly low.   That's attitude got us situation over, isn't, people asking endgame refuse one thing help end it. Everything bigger Texas....even stupidity!  national security, can't afford deliberate anti-vaccine misinformation foreign adversaries weaken nation's armed forces way dumb ass civilian population. true may water shortage problem? Denver visitors looking move newcomers hated higher real estate terrified would water shortages near future. 

I lived Denver back 2010, hope isnt true. think? Deaths take time report don‚Äôt show weeks spikes cases, plenty hospitals Texas, Florida, etc ICUs capacity.

I‚Äôm worried shouldn‚Äôt full ICUs point wasn‚Äôt legitimate problem. Thank fuck live NE. Never ever living South.   frightening vision future states start hack hospitals cut oxygen people's ventilators. want think lot actually pro vaccine, doubts one due ‚Äúnew‚Äù. course, lot antivaxers gonna understand easy way.

Vaccine passes public places reduce number then? wouldn‚Äôt freak out. You‚Äôre still good spot Uh, Covid hit Washington state bad NY. Then, NY LA SF kept spreading. Spring Break right NYC refrigeration trucks dead bodies. Florida exploded cases.

Delta strain, Melbourne (Australia) MCG cluster: month ago, asymptomatic positive case attended football game. around 2000 people section stands, 5 caught virus. Mask adherence high.

Original strain, 2020 'Black Lives Matter' protest, Melbourne Australia. asymptomatic person attended event among around 10000 people. Mask adherence appeared 99.5% higher photographs. transmission occurred. person would attend (indoor) workplace transmit virus multiple colleagues customers, likely highly infectious.

_______

This scientific paper anything, reasonable conclusion draw transmission risks moderately densely packed outdoor environments masks miniscule prior Delta, low miniscule now.

I would suggest taking minimal precautions weekly cases area lower 0.05% population, moderate precautions 0.05-0.5%, extreme precautions weekly cases exceed 0.5% population (over local regulations)

Minimal precautions means avoid indoor events people, wearing masks indoor venues indoor thoroughfares social distancing possible, testing isolating first sign flu symptoms.

Moderate precautions means plus avoiding indoor events 20, avoiding shopping centres except essentials, wearing masks indoor sittings except house, wearing masks outdoor situations people around.

Extreme measures would plus leaving house without mask, attending anyone else's house all, meeting one two people outdoors only, avoiding shopping centres entirely (buying essentials online) possible possible, attending extremely off-peak hours. 2nd shot Pfizer recently.


It must little unsettling wonder might fared shots. research. kid not, told Also it‚Äôs vaccinated causing need everyone vaccinated. allowed virus deadly enough transform try keep alive. let everyone deal via normal immune systems.

Listen love like family bro different beliefs never argued don‚Äôt want now. 10 years commercials saying ‚ÄúIf got Maderna vaccine developed cancer could part class action lawsuit‚Äù could wrong fda minimum stands behind don‚Äôt want stick chemical still get Covid stuck.

Great! get Tokyo? clinic uncertain second dose even available next month due insufficient supply. always good keep stuff perspective. individual basis, disease never particularly dangerous. Even absolute vulnerable, top top, never even scratches like 50/50 rate hospitalization and/or death. that's catch first place. odds literally always favor. I'm advocating taking unnecessary risks acting like everything normal. panicking outlook individual vaccinated person 2021 really grounded reality. doesnt seem great, comparatively. really wish they'd let us got J&amp;J go get MRNA vax now. ""take first one available"" said, we've left out. people still look web without adblockers. fascinating. they're usually asymptomatic mild, rarely result hospitalization death.

The point many (most) us *didn't* get vaccine protect *ourselves*. got protect *other people*. guys literally admitting vaccine failed one job. still need mask vaccinated, bloody pointless getting it.

And lecture getting covid - *I already got it*. I'm fine. I've worse colds. matter time tragedy like strikes ethnicity indoctrinated caring ""We're testing much, test less get numbers down"" ~ idiot. Roaches Raid. Let‚Äôs continue require masks. make sense?!? worth reaction moderna mild, fatigue intense weightlifting whole body, fine next day two. Modernas. sore arm fatigue. Thankfully fever chills I'm extremely sensitive medications. also CFS I'm general weak sickly time. slight breeze could knock fall would fatal, LOL. miracle virtually side effects 2nd dose.

Another shocking thing father physician around alot Covid patients none family vaccinated (mom, dad, 2 brothers) ever breakthrough covid infections. go ER unrelated issues admitted middle delta surge. wait 4 hours bed open ICU ED filled Covid patients. happened twice think would gotten Covid. even stupid stuff like touch doors ER touch nose mouth ü§£. week ago.

 Thanks Moderna! time like never want live TX Florida. Cheaper living housing used draw living there. checking databases across state lines though? Seems one could cross border get one wanted. moderna also, little overall medical issues, pre-diabetic time impacted wisdom teeth.

First shot gave chills 6 hours later, sore arm day after.

Second shot left pretty well knocked feet around 36 hours, muscle aches, chills, killer headache, could concentrate anything time. basically sat back chair turned ATLA.

Would meant extra protection. delta appears pretty good causing mild infections vaccinated. You‚Äôll almost certainly fine, kids immunocompromised may be.

That's literally admission anti-vax crowd right beginning. vaccine work one job - preventing spread virus.

If vaccine works, vaccinated people need masks. doesn't, anti-vaxxers right along. two positions available. reports make money. Whatever truth may written way publication make money. want look write way look. similar experience J&amp;J.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Going get booster 2 weeks, leaning towards Pfizer, sure anymore. (First vaccination J&amp;J April) Anyone opinions this?  love see it. think possible ""brute force"" control spread virus like China did/does. seal entire regions hint whiff outbreak, forcibly quarantine people, heavily track movement activity apps, etc. seems work well, country continues run.

The issue even though theoretically work, like epidemiology tells us should, never happen practical level western world. stuff simply compatible things here. people say ""lockdowns work"", wrong - really option. That's wheelhouse. shitty half-version it, watch inevitably fail, conclude ""lockdowns work"". stuff, like vaccinate way out, go natural herd immunity, live endemic virus, combination thereof. Sure! Here's one add bought house 2018, $200k anymore house, closer $300k. rent $1350, gone too. apartment like $1600 now. get barrel rents here. seriously sums perfectly studies Astrazenica -Moderna? recommended BioNtech second shot, maybe might make sense take Moderna. Australia done wonderful job contact tracing studies suggest Delta transmitted ""fleeting contact"", I'm pretty sure surgical masks buy full 60 mins Delta.

I'm sure ever heard Dr. Osterholm, he's Director Center Infectious Disease Research Policy. Anyway, podcast listen time-to-time, gets lot flack ""anti-mask"" he's really anti-mask. tries emphasize obvious, masks created equal. Basically sharing air, masks buy time. think get away calling ""masks"" start talking value different kinds masks effectiveness certain situations.

Having said that, think ignore importance **40-60% efficacy source control** (u/Adodie mentioned post links). information, practically own, IMHO supports indoor mask mandates. However, people want minimize transmission much possible, need way informing people right types masks wear different situations. 

For example, going drive-thru, simple cloth mask surgical mask probably fine - enough barrier protect ""fleeting contact"" transmissions brief period time. Especially person wearing mask - *again, source control important.* But, going indoors prolonged period time people outside immediate household, need wear something better surgical mask.

For children age 12, cannot yet vaccinated, need talking KN95s KF94s. Normally, would say N95s, can't seem find N95s fit small children (I found 'small' sizes, seem smaller adult faces).

Ultimately, think Governor Cox Utah right comes giving KN95s kids (I **do not** agree decision sign mask mandate ban). need giving masks better job protecting kids cloth surgical masks. also can't expect masks 100% heavy lifting. Schools going socially distance much possible, improve ventilation, utilize outdoor spaces whenever possible, practice cohorting much possible, maintain good hand hygiene sanitizing practices, list goes on...

If things come together multi-layer approach, schools **will** able minimize spread Delta protect children.

Edit: Reposted tried link articles mask giveaways mask mandate ban, apparently news sources Utah trusted bots.  Yeah, everyone is/was denial Israeli data finding ways nitpick statistics methods. Israeli data fine, hit Delta earlier, vaccinations done earlier wearing faster too. Also, much better system identifying mild/asymptomatic vaccine breakthrough cases, vaccine efficacy infection always look lower places vaccinated people bother getting tested unless get really sick. Efficacy severe disease still good. What's shortest time person wait J&amp;J mRNA top up? 

I hit two weeks J&amp;J Friday want avail Moderna FDA approves fully starts officially recommend booster, probably better end August, would month getting J&amp;J jab. Thanks #4 reason people skeptical (2% case drop 3 weeks isn‚Äôt really effective) live like another year 

If think what's going happen, kidding yourself.

I want happen, neither you, point probably start realizing facts here: COVID absoluely endemic, huge segment population realize this, media outlets producing many scare-articles panic readers becoming complete misinformation. Furthermore, instead taking advantage miracle technology vaccination, leaders completely reverted back trying Summer 2020 tactics universal masking social distancing. Vaccines kids take forever get approved, full approval vaccines barely spur businesses get people vaccinated. businesses retreat nothing, vaccine mandates mirage, especially government fails support them.

We continue masking throughout rest 2021, also continue masking spring/early summer 2022. media continue write scare articles variants even know yet, dedicated scream mask little longer vaccination percentage goes 2% COVID disappear overnight. Meanwhile, leaders preoccupied encouraging masking rather worrying end game: vaccination followed speedy return normalcy. end, end game, end COVID US, gradual slow disappearance tired weary public learns stop caring it.

I wish wrong, I'm not. learned nothing last 17 months, continue fail adapt COVID. come subreddit 6 months now, people talking topics echoing sentiments. tragic, depressing, mind-numbing outcome, almost inevitable.

Only politicians messages stay face evidence - ‚Äúno masks, mandates, etc. people shouldn‚Äôt trusted Still Israel obviously less 90% protection severe cases, cases within vaccinated 90% unvaccinated 10%. Simple mathematics. find surprising. immune system detects new antigen, rapidly replicates new antibodies. would expect strong dose dependent relationship. It‚Äôs like 1 antigen induces 1 antibody, usually moment body finds new antigen gets work generating lots antibodies storing memory cells. maybe degree dose response. That‚Äôs everyone said last year too. homeschooled kids last year concerns everyone raised, much happened far recall. Good.

So, cases vaccinated population; would've gotten worse, thanks relatively low vaccination rate specific area country (78%) public emergency measures taken swiftly. Personally, would vote someone came clean, someone admits faults, even I'd weary. American politics, mind I'm mid 30s-not followed much, become like abusive relationship me. know trust, sometimes I'm flabbergasted ravenous cult like following certain individuals erected. age knowledge, one reason, clear understanding gone, ever even here? point, I'm pretty much right you. idea downvoted. vaccine available months. havent gotten otherwise able so, playing roulette health, zero sympathy if/when suffer consequences. tired brain dead morons giving fire oxygen can't set aside pride. joke. recently shared pic said something like, ""Last year, nurses called heroes. thousands fired personal health choice! stand freedom, force"" blah blah. left hospice hospital dodge getting vaccine, whining possibility find yet another job hospital system mandates it.

Four young people describe it‚Äôs like OK, let's somewhat apples-to-oranges comparison, hospital stays Canada. Based 2019-2020 numbers, COVID baked (but much), hospital *stay* rates (which calculated based hospital admissions, person bad enough require exam treatment) respiratory diseases children 0-4 was:

- 36 kids daily acute lower respiratory rate infections
- 19 kids daily pneumonia
- 11 kids daily asthma
- 8 kids daily acute upper respiratory infections multiple unspecified sites
- 6 kids daily seasonal influenza virus  

This means 80 young kids admitted daily hospital condition bad enough require staying days, yet risk considered benign enough protective measures whatsoever taken.

 True, population Canada double population Florida (which offset Canadian statistic requiring staying least day), yet get idea: less apples-to-bicycles example easily isolated toys playgrounds, risk people willing take without shutting childhood.

Data source: appreciate comment anything. wife 39-weeks pregnant could give birth day. decided get vaccine (I got vaccine right away), wait gives birth. TOTALLY understand pregnant women would get vaccine, especially around people. wife works home literally quarantined past 9-months. made choice would rather interact people lessen risk take vaccine time. agreed interact people regularly would no-brainer get vaccine.

It's absolutely no-win situation. Family members berated getting vaccine, wants ensure health baby. I'm saying vaccine side effects babies, I'm noting even year, unknown everything scary. think CDC one day recommend vaccine pregnant women next day sudden changes scary proposition.

China hoax democrat flu! ""Fauci harder, daddy!"" Gotcha theory cases go hospitalizations deaths won‚Äôt follow like now. already see high vaccination rate places, avoiding worst outcomes

That end game - avoid outcomes make virus manageable cuz we‚Äôre gonna eradicate it. least near term Sadly, unsurprised this. heard anecdotally women life/friends friends trying get pregnant hold vaccine seem think it'll adversely impact fertility. found old friend's wife waiting take vaccine gave birth. antivaxxers friend took shot soon could, appears lot misconceptions vaccine negative affect really cause even believe that. anyone CDC NIH think there‚Äôs chance eradicating they‚Äôre huffing farts.

J&amp;J recipient (late March) COVID-19 January.

We‚Äôre fucked continue play politics? Plus don‚Äôt think Cooper run ‚Äò24 cannot take information politics isolated cases.


I say anything politics. 


N95 masks like half face full face masks various filters/canisters used many workers around world years.


And efficiency evident cases dead/sick soon literally tons research proves vaccines infinitely effective masks.


Would mind showing tons research proving vaccines infinitely effective masks? please forget talking N95 better used properly.  Yes, that‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs also deceptive. lot voters spread rural, low population counties. live, Detroit, right across county line, 40% residents 12+ vaccinated. also 675K people, that‚Äôs lot. Adjacent Macomb County, went red 2020, 58%. empathize easily Detroit‚Äôs population hesitant, can‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs massive problem. We've lost 30% nursing tech staff across entire health system since COVID started. never come back. People thought nursing shortage COVID, going much worse. Incognito mode. longer question. Get vaccine. Abbot DeSantis pushing masks want state help. much 'party personal responsibility' guess. ""Uh yeah sweaty I'm going trust doctors studied researched years trust internet article. Except, doctor disagrees me, he's crackpot."" 58.8% total population 1+ dose. (41.2% without)

About 34% population natural immunity (probably higher now, CDC est months ago havent checked)

.588+ (.34 *.412) = 69.8% 

So rounding 70% type protection. 30% nothing.

331 million population * .3 = 99.3m right? Let burn everyone. got J&amp;J almost exact time except 23 weeks pregnant. Literally 2 days later whole blood clot issue came light. I‚Äôm due deliver weeks I‚Äôm honestly happy made decision get vaccine. Excited meet little one soon getting nervous going hospital cases rising. People actually concerned flu variants, ones concern would pigs catching bird flus, mutating form humans catch. tend extremely dangerous highly contagious.

The regular seasonal flu mainly cycles antigens minor changes, otherwise pretty stable humans evolved viruses long time. Yes follow China doing. 

That always great route go.... Don‚Äôt forget zoom logins! support right choose also need choose another profession.  agree everything said, I'm convinced virus ""giving us one go."" one knows come pass hope right, I'm doubtful that. Asia doesn‚Äôt US‚Äôs level vaccination. 28k cases yesterday.. rate infections imagine deaths weeks‚Ä¶  probably try sue. Seems type. Ah, okay, makes huge difference imo - would've shocked really decided make people pay medical tests. Events travel different story. people want anti-vax, start making pay way appropriately then. slowing resolution pandemic costing everyone money process. Makes sense. RemindMe! 6 months   American college gynecology Society maternal fetal medicine explicitly stated doctor recommending vaccine pregnant women trying conceive unequivocally going standards care. keep up, plus massive previously infected numbers, covid going start running hosts soon, right? true anymore? almost .2% people US died Covid. that‚Äôs including people haven‚Äôt gotten sick.  pretty chill virus since pandemic started. Took precautions course wasn‚Äôt freaking out. now. considering sending kids school remote homeschooling. Florida control atm. it‚Äôs okay! We‚Äôll die free!!! Woohoo‚Ä¶.  Yes no. 

Science: studies I‚Äôve seen. trials (and general public since then), side effects common second shot first, higher percentage affected Moderna Pfizer. scientists medical professionals pretty much agree side effects tied well immune system responded; side effects doesn‚Äôt mean immune system didn‚Äôt job.

Anecdotally though, two patterns I‚Äôve seen. Reasonably health seniors seem fewer side effects. people actually Covid stronger side effects vaccine, often first shot rather second (though one know personally, hospitalized Covid weeks last year, got ass seriously kicked doses). 

For everyone else though, it‚Äôs really random.  Bro, point , willing accept vaccine peephole. FL's vaccine rate deceptively high since much older population. vaccine rate among younger (13-50) good bit national average. driving surge. Never. Almost epidemiologists say never return pre-2019 time. Maybe flare-ups less impact 20-30 years, always there. Endemic. entirely true. Sure, nothing happened Federal level, Sandy Hook Connecticut passed bunch gun reform *because of* Sandy Hook. Here's state did: instituted universal background checks purchase gun, expanded state's assault weapons ban, outlawed sale new high-capacity ammunition magazine, passed law prohibiting people domestic violence restraining orders accessing guns. already mask mandate regardless vaccination status schools buildings. kids start getting sick state actually something it. Genetics plays part well, people family drastically overweight even crappy diet. eat basically whatever want never put pound on, fiance however look slice chocolate cake gain 10 pounds. rest family like well. Make fine $1000. Make example someone open tip line someone turns guy making fake cards. CDC even numbers CDC even numbers  72%, track 80% next couple weeks. Props. 

Whose hiring? too. media slow reporting. 

 think ICU beds Friday. lot deaths opening beds now.  guess 15 beds open day 18 new ICU patients per day right now.

Be safe there. wrong, need re-calculate. Many nurses know ill-informed misguided (MLM, essential oils, etc) people. understand it, probably never will. know multiple vaccinated people caught virus personally want deal catching right potentially spreading anyone (including kids i'm around can't vaccinated) I'm cautious. coworker conversations would take make people take seriously. response ""When kids start die."" point, I'm even sure thatd it. Everywhere country worst 90% normal. vaccines almost brought us way there, virus giving us one go. Delta spike vaccines still work natural immunity. trouble reading graph, showing effectiveness of:

- One dose, prior covid
- One dose, prior covid
- Two doses, prior covid
- Two doses, prior covid.


It shows across three variants:

- Classical (Lineage A)
- Beta (B 1.351)
- Gamma (P.1)

Higher neutralization = better.

So four listed - goes least effective most.

And thus least effective ""no prior covid single shot"" whereas ""prior covid two shots"" Anyone seeing hearing large amounts false negatives rapid antigen tests?  work state gov coworker told get tested, needed quarantine, exposed covid vaccinated. ended testing positive work last week, whole lab teleworking wait get tested/results PCR test üôÉ Makes wonder Desantis precautionary measures. Like, masks even big deal. strange relationship. absolutely agree! use classes already. kids really like home last year, I'm sure long person situation going last anyways. friend child already quarantined exposed first day. Mine fully vaxxed get quarantined, still want exposed obviously. Ugh. terrible, fully-preventable situation. HahahahahahahahahahahahahahahHhahahahahaha

Now make permanent twitter, k thanks ""Sir, Wendys"" I‚Äôm terrified Northern states come fall, even though vaccination general higher. We‚Äôre okay now, worry weather gets cooler people start heading indoors more. would reflect exactly happened last fall southern states getting hit first northern states following fall winter.  Countries Indonesia Thailand bet heavily China‚Äôs Sinovac, despite warnings medical experts

This super disingenuous. ""bet"" Chinese vaccines - ones available! Rich nations hoarding vaccines half year. USA allow export single domestically-produced dose 6 months. Whether right wrong point - point is, poorer nations absolutely choice. nations around world *still* struggling get access vaccines. 3.6 roentgen. great, terrible.  ask, cheek bones fake? Wild type coming back. It'll Omega. :p High stress, long hours, sales reps constantly catering grab attention. experience hospitals nurses tend better shape doctors, average younger. You‚Äôre comparing old data hasn‚Äôt time take Delta account. Either you‚Äôre acting obtuse, tiresome, you‚Äôre oblivious, sad. literally fucking Twitter. Cry river. settle believe bad Democrats solution worse Republicans. Personally, I'm favor strikes. wrote probably upsetting me, rings true. Really, way fades away longer care it. accept death toll, accept tragedy. long happening directly us, really happening, mentality. sad way us live, children inherit. indifference life others. that's exactly US this, always be.  went Lollapalooza unvaccinated tested negative. I'm never getting vaccinated.

(Not really, see silly sounds?) Well I‚Äôm going doxx linking kids school district reopening plan county level vaccination rates area find hard believe you‚Äôre woefully informed and/or fortunate enough live south.

I never made claim schools anywhere taking precautions. said depends live. people position power calling zero covid? havent seen anyone that.

What hear mostly people saying get endemic (so predictable flu-like amount deaths).

My guess get another Winter, enough vaccinations &amp; infections get endemic death/infection numbers.   still time go back 2005 make more.  mondays numbers. Nice try. Yup, correct. death rate Delta lower Covid majority old people vaccinated (82% Texas ones died far higher rates younger people.

Do people still die Delta? course. correctly stated, lower rate vaccinations existed. hear ya. Sorry wrote comment sarcastically. 100s ICU beds left 2nd biggest state. worrying beds may available needed.  Well sub indication, needlessly scare people America first correct right do, hit demand slump ridiculous share. Rachel McAdams, woman played romantic lead *three* time travel movies (four count Doctor Strange). Big boned thing makes weight. bigger frame. doesn‚Äôt lead weight. extra couple lbs. 30 extra lbs. Surely space 0 covid hospitals collapsing?

Vaccinations massively across US, still end game, even unfortunate hickups getting people vaccinated. Sadly, either settle basically get completely unhinged people running show. 95% doctors gotten vaccinated. Unfortunately nurses higher percentage rejecting vaccination.

I've seen every kind redditor insane r/NNN idiots sane reasoning maskers/vaxxers, everything between. worrying chest pain solid week Moderna. Really nervous third :( Didn‚Äôt realize wasn‚Äôt allowed read news conversations surrounding news.

I certainly spend 2-4 hours day it, would say interested, obsessed. may die, sacrifice willing make. Dunno. can‚Äôt answer tube throat.

Great, thank obese someone shoots gun survive due complications health organs (because obesity), still gun shot killed you. know works better either things? Vaccines.

Vaccines also advantage nearly harmful--socially economically--as social distancing.

We mandate vaccines mandate distancing.

We also mandate vaccines parallel mandating masks stopgap. hold true. might cavalier way put it, lots people can‚Äôt kids biologically either- doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt baby. 

I can‚Äôt ever children due childhood accident. sucks. still feel really shitty sometimes, especially I‚Äôm around young kids reminds me. doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt children.

I feel women‚Äôs fertility issues, deadly pandemic that‚Äôs killed 600k+ US alone, mention millions people lasting issues, someone‚Äôs ability children doesn‚Äôt matter much they‚Äôre putting everyone else risk. Especially leading OBs nation highly recommend vaccine, pregnancy considered high risk is.

I truly feel woman miscarriage, certainly feel lot worse people lives cut short. Sandy Hook means faith argument anymore Sources? wonder cried FREEDUM take vaccines measles, mumps, rubella know. Procrastinating guess. always going get it. definitely gotten sooner I've learned one thing pandemic, definitely want parent America.  Chinese vaccines necessarily cheaper. bigger countries region like Indonesia Thailand, basically vaccines available large quantities. Even delays.

Thailand bigger much richer country way behind vaccination drive compared Cambodia, vaccines China. Cambodia population 15 Million far fully vaccinated 40% population, 50% one dose. Outside Singapore, best vaccination rate East Asia, beating likes Japan South Korea. present 500 cases day, drop 900 early July. Vietnam Thailand 9000 20,000 cases respectively. absolutely tested expert conclusion, simple sourced amount fear mongering change that. simply evidence claims research data finds opposite, simply irresponsible kill pregnant mothers fetus zero evidential basis. believe really important parents idea risks COVID children, I've research recently assess risks. **I expert -- welcome comments -- thought may helpful parents navigate worrisome time** (sorry seen -- I've reposted threads talk kids COVID think important idea behind risks):

**Morality Risks:** Obviously, there's extremely fine line walk here: every death child horrendously tragic, cannot imagine parent child died hospitalized. good news parents, however, mortality risks still remain low. [Out 74,000,000 kids U.S., 519 died COVID since crisis began (as July works mortality rate 0.0007%, 0.015% amongst confirmed cases COVID. Again, immensely tragic -- simply put, child die -- parent, I'd probably worried prospects long-term COVID symptoms (discussed below)

**Risks Delta:** Delta new, still much know. However, data U.K (where Delta hit time now) gives us clues. Let's start good news: [based data U.K., kids remain least impacted age group long access vaccines, kids age 5-14 still far lowest hospitalization rates demographic (this past week, 1.08/100,000; kids age 0-4 noticeably higher rates -- 3.12/100k -- though still lower age group). Similarly, chance child would hospitalized confirmed case COVID similar prior waves, maybe even little bit lower.

The bad news? Well, kids going get Delta account transmissible, particularly areas schools taking precautions. know it, we're seeing now, Delta insanely transmissible. fact we're already seeing records hospitalizations amongst kids extremely bad, say least. fact already occurring indications cases nationally close peaking really troubling (An aside: interestingly, U.K. never break record youth hospitalizations Delta we're breaking now. really know, anyone insight it'd interesting hear).

**Risks Long COVID/The Disease Course Generally:** still lots learn long COVID, Delta new enough current studies really address it. COVID generally, however, earliest studies suggested frighteningly high rates long-lasting symptoms (one even pegged third!). suffered immense methodological weaknesses, low sample sizes, parental-reported symptoms, probable selection bias, control groups.

More recent research (which perfect still includes many weaknesses, least somewhat better) suggested much lower rates first studies, albeit risks real. sampling recent work include:

* [In self-reported survey UK, 95% infected kids symptoms lasting longer four weeks, 98% symptoms 56 I'm understanding study correctly, analyzed kids symptomatic COVID, would lower rates infections).
* [In survey UK people COVID, estimated 7.4% children aged 2-11 reported symptoms 12 weeks (this study included control group)
* [In one study control group, researchers found kids infected COVID Zurich actually likely report symptoms long-COVID kids clear: study imply long-Covid occur. However, true, suggests actual prevalence long-COVID kids likely quite low. (This definitely encouraging study found).

So, what's average course illness children (again, caveat research pre-Delta)? First off, seems \~50% children totally asymptomatic ([the Lancet cites source suggesting 43-68% cases asymptomatic). symptoms, one study found median symptom duration 6 days, common symptoms headache fatigue (see previous link).

Three final notes:

First, need careful discussing long-COVID differentiate symptoms bad manageable (and resolve time), symptoms debilitating. Unfortunately, understanding, current research really addressed adequately. Lancet study least (first bullet point), common symptoms lasted children lasting symptoms 1) fatigue, 2) loss smell, 3) (to lesser degree) headaches. really resolve question -- depending levels fatigue, example, certainly debilitating -- think something really lose sight discussing long-COVID.

Second: I've seen concerns organ damage like. really seen great studies focusing children (I well may missed some, take gospel). Moreover, studies I've run across adults, there's lots jargon always clear medical implications certain findings are. Thus, really focused -- might exist, expertise want misinterpret findings.

Third, risks -- even quantified -- hard interpret, people probably different reactions numbers. Let's say [the Lancet (showing 1.8% children symptomatic COVID symptoms lasting days) correct. one hand -- child catches COVID -- means he/she extremely unlikely symptoms last long. One hand -- still means lots kids symptoms last long time.

**Takeaways:** Building last point: people look data likely come different conclusions. me, look feel somewhat reassured -- there's zero risk (there's definitely not) what's currently happening absolutely tragic, data speaks somewhat lower risks impression I'd likely get spent whole day sub. again, I'm also parent. Others may look data (particularly long-COVID studies) still reasonably feel worried.

**In event -- know I'm preaching choir -- important thing protect kids around get vaccinated. happen parent children age 12 who's fence, please get vaccinated, too. It'll protect child truly nasty disease help lower risk around child, too.**  Right on, completely understand questioning HIPPA violation part. I‚Äôm actually similar position wife‚Äôs APN treats colorectal cancer patients. We‚Äôve several fundraisers benefits years I‚Äôve we‚Äôve come across patients grocery stores she‚Äôs always speaks them. She‚Äôs pretty serious HIPPA violations questioned it.  many patients she‚Äôs treated years end making it‚Äôs pretty hard her.  It‚Äôs definitely tough job I‚Äôll take engineering desk job day. Hey friend, great points well organized. would suggest keeping eye however seeing shift covid US. predominant circulating US strain June alpha variant, contagious (ie easier spread) virulent (ie causing worse sickness) initial COVID 19 strains circulating last year. June lowest level transmission Covid US since start pandemic. 

Unfortunately since end June throughout month July Delta variant overtaken essentially supplanted nearly variants US. [source contagious virulent previous strains (see cdc.gov COVID-19 ‚Äúvariants virus‚Äù). 

I can‚Äôt speak everywhere, unfortunately (in Arkansas) seeing significant uptick impact adolescents young adults requiring hospitalization treatment covid. (not mention rising cases among standard risk populations elderly). track surpass state peak covid levels January coming weeks unless rates change. 

On 8/4 Arkansas secretary health (Dr Jose Romero) gave webinar Arkansas chapter American Academy Pediatrics state secretary education getting back school AR. reported April-July 2020 compared April-July 2021 Arkansas saw increases covid 19 cases children &lt;18years (n=5,891) increase hospitalizations kids &lt;18. included 15 icu admissions (a 275% increase). 

National cumulative numbers remain essentially now, truth rates significant disease still low children, delta preliminarily looking like kids greater risk significant illness we‚Äôve seen point pandemic. probably true. would hope republicans would think twice actions held accountable. Double edged sword, guess. Right start insurrection nothing seems happen.  AZ started many districts late July, oh governor one ones passed mask mandate ban. Part reason Fall break early October Spring break. Pandemic aside, situation, makes sense AZ, get kids school July temps summer brutal, give fall break temps cool enough actually allow people things outdoors. serious time! Fool four times watch out.  provide one anecdote.

My SIL talented elementary school music teacher Master's degree Ivy. also wants baby soon, trouble conceiving first. OBGyn told effects vaccine fertility unknown, can't wholeheartedly endorse vaccination time. wildly irresponsible stance, he's got medical license carries lot weight. Needless say, vaccinated.

I epidemiologist frustrated say least. 
Not entirely true‚Ä¶ black hispanic people less likely vaccinate groups vote  surprised number women *really* Disney. Like full nerd shit way guys nerd DC Marvel. insanity guess  
 
No, insanity telling vaccinated individual die get covid. fact. know overwhelmingly unlikely.  
  upset mild inconvenience thats helping stay active alive.  
  
Please. know mask provides much greater protection others individual wearer (and absolutely downplaying effectiveness controlling spread). What's helping stay active alive covid vaccination luckily effective made chance dying covid something longer need worry participating one favorite hobbies.  
  
Covid absolutely serious, acting like significant risk unless wear mask despite vaccinated fearmongering nonsense. I'm healthcare worker Florida, I'm aware I'd like be. What's point relates comment? fairness weren‚Äôt lot hospitals Arkansas begin with‚Ä¶ data January 2021. lot happened since then, especially Delta. Also survival mean woods. Many people, including children, dealing long haul issues. need lose weight know I'm also fatty need lose weight.

It's hard.  Perhaps ask advance, know time shop around. call could influence dynamic.  Oh god, this, much. known risks associated covid far FAR outweigh known risks (are even any?) vacine.

""tHeSE womaN aNTi Vax""... Bollox.

Pregnant women getting vacines pregnancy ages. different. 

I'm 34 weeks, fully vaccinated I'm pissed I'll likely sharing ward heap anti vaxers.   Delta affecting things bit differently not?  know someone hospital right 32 baby also hospital (he poorly, baby recovering though). vaccinated, expect probably would killed him. wife also it, hospitalized laid like 2 weeks home husband oxygen debating putting ventilator sick baby.

I know someone covid last year extreme immune reaction basically severe arthritis now, basically laid almost year joints fucked. 28.

I know someone else hospital oxygen last summer, around 30. 

I know someone got beginning struggled brain fog depression since it, completely fine prior reason depressed. fully thinks covid.

These people know personally. may low risk % wise, low risk get super fucked potentially lifetime die, better bet much smaller risk reactions mild.

but life, disagree choice get vaccinated, I'll certainly argue ability choice, go public spaces require vaccination. there. lol. body choice, everyone elses body suffer it.

I know someone early 50's died blood clot days recovering covid. know that's young there's proof covid caused but, know super old either, likely did. Removing aid means people die. aim harm DeSantis, harming families Florida even more. You‚Äôre right, didn‚Äôt wait left winter surge, one ICU doc old hospital Dec 2019 still there. Hmm, sort mass gathering could traced too? ü§î seems first study looking detail effects COVID mRNA vaccines female fertility. Although sample small, differences noticed. 

This give peace mind young women receiving vaccination.  remember people tried force teachers back classrooms unvaccinated Super-relieving scary noises coming Israel vaccine efficacy. Political points. huge percentage voters don‚Äôt believe science see masks violation ‚Äúfreedoms‚Äù. 

Same people claim they‚Äôd go war take bullet country won‚Äôt take shot arm neighbor. Yes, thank goodness Operation Warp Speed - brought Trump administration.  shit.  someone said earlier, kid went MSD high school Parkland shredded campus. Nobody batted eye. aren‚Äôt learning damn thing. difference reduce odds even roll covid dice vaccine roll dice. actual fuck even saying. Take grammar class come back us. Ask itemized bill, often *mysteriously* lower hospital bills, though always. Hospitals someone talk financial department cost burden, charities help pay people‚Äôs bill. Often, pay full ‚Äúchunk‚Äù bill once, usually 20-30%, seen low 10-15%, disregard rest consider paid full. There‚Äôs also payment plans. Pay losers per month even takes years pay off. took almost 8 pay NICU bill kept original payment plan agreement even could afford add more. Petty, perhaps, oh well.

Would like try again? I‚Äôll help - ask question like lying.

‚ÄúWhy invested letting say, zero evidence, delta variant KILLING (not impacting, affecting, infecting KILLING) LOTS LOTS (not few, LOTS LOTS) children?‚Äù



Ask like answer. could absolutely support that. ZDoggMD really good explanation Tube channel doctor's arguments valid. Would mind linking please? went thread able find  based I'm saying sentence unnecessary say hold true people fertility issues. choose convince pregnant women another approach. 

Also mentioning adoption women suffering infertility #1 unappreciated rudest thing Governor Abbott numerous chances crub virus, instead made every bad choice helped spread. Calling help, still steps stop spread. credit, most. Probably much higher anything, data point probably means among professions supporting profession COVID vaccine mandate, teachers pretty high percentage support.

I'm teacher, I'm vaccinated I'd already vote mandate profession, given option. risk low, add layer defense breakthrough family? 

If part job protect kids, *especially* can't get vaccinated, I'd want coworkers vaccinated even more. Good point. problem enough one's remain would much shoulder's.

Always started day labor day September. Covid island, 3 week minimum stays. Negative pcr get off. get urgency one needs rush job, could disastrous disagree statement, things important may effecting system returning work.


I‚Äôd like see drug testing enacted anything, overhaul job applications process.


As well stimulus working, required prove vaccine status.  would personally avoid indoor attractions indoor dining. Outdoors way safer. Gotta remember base. Older, likely complications due obesity diabetes. could difference 1% 5%. 5% would make state competitive again. what's point?

Four months ago, Florida #28 1,583 deaths per million. behind Ohio 1,611 deaths per million.

Today, Florida 1,859 deaths per million (a 17% increase) Ohio 1,761 (a 9% increase).

New York, comparison, went 2,634 2,793 (a 6% increase).

As 8/1, Florida averaging 75 new deaths per day 7-day moving average. Ohio averaging **3**. New York averaging **7**.

Do see people might little concerned Florida?  anything destructive about? Here's another Shut fucking country already handle couple months lockdown  misrepresentation best - applies certain classes workers (healthcare professionals example), required vaccinated job. number assuming everyone get possibly tested getting tested willing get tested. Asymptomatic people people might refuse go get tested, would surprised real number thousand higher. pretty sad.  nothing say convince change opinion. wore masks gym every day nearly year, despised passion. advice provide make experience better ignores wish wear mask first place. 

If I'm forced wear mask indoors again, will. deeply annoyed it. difficult get reporting vaccinated infections vs unvaccinated, cuts data like age/gender/state/etc? Like, CDC want release it? course wait till pernicious effects delaying kids‚Äô social educational development take hold society. Inevitably lead greater incidences unemployment, criminality, violence, mental health issues, suicides, etc among population kids get older. importance in-person schooling can‚Äôt overlooked. course, doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt mask get vaccinated time! surprising, thought would least two weeks hospitalizations spiked states. MC(19)GA? did. Super super super senior! 

Lol he's janitor, really gets shit end stick. hoping stays healthy all. far, good. visit sometimes, might pleasantly surprised. all, actually vaccinated. I'm afraid fighting lost battle go logic variety ways lmao.

Ok, give example  good bad news otherwise Well, maybe \*you\*. thinking thing. saw Reddit withdraw Scientific American article unsubstantiated journalistic source.

But Vanity Fair? problemo.   lying misinformed. What‚Äôs point?

I‚Äôm talking vaccine ever sold 100%. Every news source said weren‚Äôt 100% logically would get Covid. Maybe they‚Äôve recently started use it. AFAIK deliveries Q1 barely Q2 Everyone great leader. Thanks Andy! Sorry hear that. way *Weeps American* won‚Äôt need make policy need start triage based best chances survival, seems vaccinated people almost always better prognosis better chance survival, they‚Äôll get care unvaccinated get jack shit. Suspended?? Doug, kick tour! That‚Äôs works. turn whole nations fertility year idiots want people sick? thanks link - 14 day future forecast set first chart pretty interesting. point, catching Covid inevitable. going catch point, like going catch cold flu point.

You reduce odds catching short term, given enough trials chance getting going trend 1. Yeah, I‚Äôve stopped caring adults unvaccinated (unless immunocompromised).  don‚Äôt care themselves, care them? Stay home ICU's multiple states maxed moderate risk. holding festival state one lowest vaccinations rates nation moderate risk. festival goers going places festival site - making negative test irrelevant - moderate risk. Wish we'd proactive back chance stop became pandemic. Sigh. still idea international travel shut completely early days. Lockdowns work would nothing. contagious. Get vaccinated live it.

Well that‚Äôs steaming pile bullshit‚Ä¶ even Reddit.  Don‚Äôt know - vaccines still use still EAU older population. nonsense. 

There real privacy concern. vaccine mandate involving schools would doubtless widely publicized news social media. school district would send written notice parents. *Everyone working school would vaccinated condition employment would zero private medical information discuss parents.*

I strongly suspect deliberately obtuse (although possibility remains deliberate) funny keep getting comments removed saying things like title. got downvoted mentioning lower number. article:
Over period, effectiveness Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine fallen 42% 76%, researchers said. jealous people even vaccine skeptic something?  state vaccination system California. sign easily bring QR code prove you‚Äôve vaccinated. 

When coupled ID solves fake card bullshit. Nope.

How stating fact ‚Äúmoving goal posts‚Äù?

I said never saw anything vaccines 100% logically would get Covid.

I also said lying true moment new info showed up. grade in? Hey maybe shift healthcare humble yourself. Nursing doesn‚Äôt suck! party (popular) ideas, culture wars left‚Ä¶ 20% infections children who‚Äôll live upwards 4 decades fallout (which leading pacemakers 19yo kids brain damage)

Not dangerous enough you?  1. read link
2. stop spreading disinformation. 
3. They're lost causes, fuck em.  think fair trade. freedom stay un-vaxxed, vaxxed keep hospital access need it. 

You could even make better advising unvaxxed covid patients take hydroxychloroquine home. they'll really feel heard, 18 month old canard correct, need care anyway! couple nasal vaccines list. seem recall something patch mechanism, too. Vast majority needles though. vaccinating 12+. 1 go (mostly Ultra Orthodox, Israeli Arabs young ppl). shocked though law Universities Hospitals require vaccinations staff/students.  Same! I‚Äôm weeks behind you, vaccinated early healthcare workers. want booster badly keep seeing articles vaccine efficacy decreasing ~5/6 months. I‚Äôm nervous wreck it. I've never seen group better grass-roots organizing parents students disabilities. want take parents. YEARS/DECADES advocating behalf children. wish best 100%. like way think. Unfortunately don‚Äôt know answer. worst could come doesn‚Äôt work.

Edit: [This article says expressed poorly. lots deaths. Everybody vaccinated!

What meant was, COVID kill high percentage people. Like, people talk ""Darwin action,"" ""reducing ranks republicans."" 20% 50% death rate, might effects, really low percentage.

Thing is, 1% 330 million (US population) still lot people.

PS: Everybody get vaccinated.  Hey, answered question; ever heard phrase ask something actually want answer?  


This fits. good know realize effectiveness masking distancing though. Thanks that. Conservative Party Canada: ""Nice vaccine facility got there, would shame federal funding support got cut it..."" Since everyone loved downvoting post - numbers updated correctly CDC weekend 21k, even close 28k. Thanks correction number there.

While agree birthday celebration pretty big, really criticize here? unheard high profile person high profile party. 

The CDC advised everyone vaccinated gathering, need masking. hand, Fauci's latest statement regarding gatherings require proof vaccination, places like schools doctor's offices potentially immunocompromised people children 12 (who can't get vaccine yet). 

Basically, seeing significant portion population still unvaccinated (by choice not), new CDC guidance advises masks worn cant confirm everyone vaccinated.

Also bit workers wearing masks: food service worker myself, surprise. is. surprising seen many foodservice employees leave industry last year. *The breaths night labored tight...* [Here twitter thread linking 70 different studies show masks effective know, please stop making comments like this? incorrect harmful. even regret viral resources everywhere country needs (to varying extents) disproportionately given Florida simply Florida wants dumb, obnoxious cesspool artificially increased covid numbers horrendous leadership? allowed continue horrendous leadership given aid need elsewhere?  I'm aware low mortality rates toddlers (not accounting fact recent variants may different) one reasons comfortable sending daycare all.

If kids school slightest sniffle temperature sent home immediately allowed return 48 hours symptoms. points that:

1) I'd shocked find teachers vaccinated school goes go great lengths make sure kids sick and

2) people would paint teachers victims parents 'difficult' parents want know kid's teachers vaccinated.  Yeah. correlation holds, one shot two offer 70-80% protection within two weeks 

Beggars can‚Äôt choosers. It‚Äôs better nothing. think might surprised attendance. Things like busy summer. know exactly why, explanation would get deleted trigger-happy mod. kids likelihood confused reasonably high. know sister husband 100% pro-vaccine able get nephew vaccinated july figured. Seems like BS. problem isn‚Äôt number beds. It‚Äôs amount staff. ATX beds don‚Äôt enough workers. Nowhere state really does. moved Texas year. can't wait vote idiot office. Two unflushed turds floating political toilet. Yeah, I‚Äôm sure weather plays role, believe relatively consistent timing-wise FL‚Äôs wave last year

But me, doesn‚Äôt really explain difference states like MO, (my understanding) also extremely hot humid US. mean different age bracket? We‚Äôre done pleasantries here. Ok cool. assumed southern state schools opened already mandating masks.  would really like know exactly claims making. Possibly useful changing minds antivax people life. stopping taking vacation? Geniunely curious. fully vaccinated. travel. came home 3 week holiday Greece even vaccinated point. Gyms unfortunate spot obviously. 

Seems risky area given heavy breathing, ventilation needs, sweating , etc. (though haven‚Äôt seen data really spread gyms). 

I imagine one businesses could argue masking requirements hurt business though - given lot people probably don‚Äôt enjoy sporting mask working out. False. He‚Äôs one consistent voices reason pandemic remains
Non partisan Based info, think third dose 60+ would wise. see already have? Ted Cancun Cruz... deadly enough work. Older generations grew without internet trust it, younger generations grew internet know trust it. 

There's large chunk middle generations think know internet well young/adults created, seem susceptible misinformation. know enough use Google like, internet came wondrous source information. think know ins outs used use AOL made website 1995. enough knowledge dangerous, enough wary.

My dad consumed stuff falls middle category. He's early 50s rise internet tech boom 90s. wear mask get vaccinated anything.My grandmother grew knowing kids polio, gotten every vaccine including COVID. ""Republican"". lived Trump, hated him.

Realizing posted yesterday like playing tables making things easier read. definitely that. I've saying alot last days...stopped walmart southern missouri weekend. number visibly, really sick people walking around coughing wheezy one cared, mean outside employees one mask. fucked see person. 2/7 get it. 4 younger folks mildly flu-y like sinus infection really. taste smell now. child mostly asymptomatic. old in-laws verrrrry sick like bronchitis almost. absolutely terrified year half thankful everyone could get vaccinated was. it‚Äôs dealing unpaid wages expended PTO reach quarantine limits / negative tests. I‚Äôll take Gottliebs expertise dude aren‚Äôt requesting fed step yet. trying get traveling healthcare workers come Texas. suppose years able see r/dataisbeautiful posts comparing pregnancy-related COVID death rates due pandemic response. Best option: send help, steps immediately. Yes listed ACGIH article top page. Reference previous reply. admitted lier. read lab leak dossier released? name top 3 periodicals go daily. Stupid question probably, what's ICU bed? mean, probably bed mechanical function move parts also like ports connections hook drip bags heart monitoring machines into? First, fires spread pretty slowly concrete apartment buildings, fires much concern US wooden houses.

If front door opens inwards, 2 metal poles crossed make X really going stop anyone able crawl out. front door opens outwards, going tougher, looks like poles hammered maybe good kick/shove door loosen them.

The ""condo manager"" firemen also come remove metal poles. ""condo manager"" like lowest form government China, least that's gathered colleagues China. get this. Stopping elective procedures way intrusive economy wearing masks. people silly. Well, mean, hill willing die make sure many, many people lost access healthcare. least theme. Well like said, state running around 45-50% vaccination rates. metro live higher still like 60-65%. Plenty room Delta spread. seems really cruel keep bringing person back life Wait, thought everything fine Texas one wear mask bc FREEDOM ADMITTED LYING! people wonder trust broken even goal post. top 3 news establishments every morning. I‚Äôd say 5 lets keep simple since I‚Äôm getting downvotes. Finally winning something. feel superior already. Getting 2nd moderna shot Thursday. still wear mask crowded places elevators. Yea!

Note, articles pre-print. peer-reviewed yet. Hence ""likely"" certainly. :) People keep pointing they're unvaccinated. can't throw women anti-vaxxers though. legitimate concerns comes getting vaccinated. idea cause birth defects make miscarriage. They're horrible position caused anti-vaxxers there, black white decision women. US Army take even score low MOS. forget called 6 Mike? family six vaccinated people caught Covid week. Yes it‚Äôs anecdotal yes we‚Äôre highly cautious people spent year half inside double masking. CDC flipped stance transmission vaccinated people last week needs clear everyone even you‚Äôre vaccinated get delta spread exposed infected even you‚Äôre asymptomatic. funny thing is...it would still stupid issue mask mandate. went beyond that. blocked others issuing mask mandates. Honestly, assume FL TX strong executive immunity laws books shit prosecuted genocide.  we‚Äôd reached 70% vaccination states early July, we‚Äôd nation skipped delta. They're state employees Washington. Ugh. Well, expect. Mr. Garrison's dad lives Arkansas, know do. mom knew. Disgusting. 

Not kind people care others. 720 day Still mask mandates. They‚Äôre forced. choose go. No. sent back home. Someone done may need oxygen. must enjoyed Dec. 2020 Jan. 2021 much wants see again... Anyone common-sense left Texas - GET !!!  Cruz feels like wearing Badge Stupidity honor. I've saying well. also fits narrative since tell healthcare right. Well, may covid then! kept kids home sure cold. 

Thank you! cannot wait read everything this, going fascinating read! people know Moderna (my whole work it), largely fine first dose, knocked 24 hours fever second dose. ask friend Florida send help! sent police border I‚Äôm sure wouldn‚Äôt mind sending medical staff too! 

Oh wait‚Ä¶ blows narrative it‚Äôs time go it‚Äôs time. risk life long disease bad information. generation told growing can‚Äôt believe everything see/read internet, seems generation consumed misinformation. feel like rushing mix-and-match current crop vaccines

I mean it‚Äôs really opinion. Boosters approved FDA yet, recommended CDC. paper, there‚Äôs boosters right now. ofc.. 

I trying lighten mood along tone /u/SilverIdaten 's mssg don‚Äôt disagree this. saying acting like negative consequences ridiculous. totally see hospitals trying everything resort mass firings  Nobody ever sure. That's science. JnJ. Cry river! see comment guy here: love old couch too, that's makes hurt much. stitching seams, intentionally ripping further. there's people intentionally this, intentionally creating deeper divide existed personal gain. angry disgusted them. dump somewhere, sake. I‚Äôm Houston live another state now. ever heard chocolate bayou? Maybe mean dirty bay (Baytown area) trying polite? Lol Unity vs self Yeah unfortunately many people still don‚Äôt understand, especially sub mom little garden kid statues front lawn. sister going make little masks counter signs. NJ Idk feel headlines ‚Äúwill give back full rights x time.‚Äù Sounds problematic begin I‚Äôm huge Vaccine fan. Rights never go away. Restrictions due pandemic shouldn‚Äôt framed taking away rights That's BIL said basically. never quit jet-setting caught corona one endless vacations (he hot spot, Arizona), last year. told us (by text) go ahead ""get catch already"". ""quick judgement calls"". months data world says Pfizer needs boosters. know now. Fauci multiple officials said so. inevitable. thing holding going long bureaucratic process. mean tell less hospitalized covid patients deaths? whered get numbers way date. functioning society would oust ineffective, selfish, abusive political leaders‚Ä¶ Unfortunately no, comes louder voices circle. Chastising condemning vaccine take it. Yeah. sucks. stopped membership gym dropped mask mandate last fall. started got vaccinated spring. Haven‚Äôt back last month due lack mask policy even Delta circulating. Ended buying new studio bike go home gym yesterday. Looks like I‚Äôm back crappy home workouts while. did/do right now. nose little runny usual (I chronic sinus problems) headache one day (though near bad migraines). tested work required someone else building positive (I interaction said person probably picked elsewhere). 

The worst part, tbh, cancelling plans work home again. symptoms stopped Saturday work wants stay home next Monday.

Edit: also want add husband around whole time (we live small-ish apartment) continues test negative.  suppose get airplane Sunday trip Disney world. still go?

The 4 adults vaccinated, believe science, wear masks. 2 kids yet vaccinated excellent wearing masks.  wonder they'd let get Moderna already Pfizer... That‚Äôs extreme thought thing. It‚Äôs really pink bandanna Brought u moderna risk returning office depends live. I‚Äôve back office months major city we‚Äôve zero cases. people area (especially white collar professionals) vaxed. Lolololol I‚Äôm sorry loss you‚Äôre asking government lock people houses????? fuck?? unvaccinated seasoned nurse infects bunch patients they‚Äôre irrational get several extremely effective vaccines proven safe billions doses nearly year use - net-positive benefit hospital.

They‚Äôre great effective care? deliberately injure sometimes kill patients.

Jane Toppan considered great nurse doctors worked for, many patients. murdered 31-100 people, care world. Somebody send bunch masks. honestly shocked that, understand politicians gonna politicians atleast spine. God damit America! Get shit together! wanna get back Vegas spend 18 months worth savings literary making WAY longer needs be. Lol Astra plus Pfizer felt fine.
My teens Pfizer fine.
I Moderna felt like hit bus. seems though governor actually everything powers destroy Texas! gives? NY gov creeper, think actually wants kill us all. condolences. That's good hear Hillsborough County requiring now, also opt-out option parents sign. tragic, avoidable.  us border open Canada uk miss family Go TV, big press conference... Tell everyone terribly wrong stupid been. maybe we'll help you. Yup!  seems like Novavax never never. ""true"" get right limited  Well someones ""non-essential"" procedure essential person. bad people vaxed preventing others accessing health care need. unnecessary. *with one dose hardworking people two jobs kids time research airborne viruses vaccines thought could trust government. Biden literally came said, ""If fully vaccinated, longer need wear mask."" People foolish trusting government one second they're busy trying live lives survive.

I one people, demean them. pandemic still bad time next year plan life. Yeah next question. live Texas it‚Äôs mess here. Houston area. Kids went back school today. Mine wore masks. 

I high Bp that‚Äôs controlled meds 50lbs overweight. I‚Äôm getting little scared. true. slow spread, alone stop even get spread trickle. still need couple mask wearing 1) everyone wearing them, 2) social distancing, 3) washing hands, touching face, public health measures. Plus, reason people cannot figure covering mouth well nose would correct way wear them, let alone trying make correct seal.

Masks work universally worn, worn correctly, public measures followed. That's work South Korea almost everywhere else except US. Wait though said nothing wrong totally fine? Westerners think India = 3rd World Country assume things possibly get bad here. number doesn‚Äôt seem shockingly high. sure it‚Äôs wrong There‚Äôs probably couple reasons guesses:
1. Alabama‚Äôs governor great hasn‚Äôt put restrictions mask ordinances generally anti-mask science Desantis. 
2. Population density economy- don‚Äôt tourist attractions huge events time year(football could kill us). generally don‚Äôt take public transport alot people work outside. 
3. Florida better percentage sheer number unvaccinated people amount people Alabama. Yeah infants MRI check cancer last year canceled moved two months! idea going it‚Äôs cancer can‚Äôt wait around. happens due jerks can‚Äôt even. want cry! first shot two-dose vaccine give much protection Delta -- 25% - 30% effectiveness IIRC. NYTimes tracker reports 61% US adults fully vaccinated.  essential worker, want lockdown due nature job go matter what, fewer people around better, people need around around fewer people better.

That miss days would wake would traffic roads. ‚Äúthe UK much better vaccine penetration‚Äù

UK fully vaccinated adult %: 75%

US fully vaccinated adult %: 70%


People constantly overstate much vaccinated countries are, especially UK Israel That's crazy nurses doctors like need burden choosing get want play God gets live gets die they're already fucking worked max would even legal situation poor medical professionals Frontline workers working asses got deal carry weight burden who's going die that's fucked fucked  tried work day second Moderna. finally left around noon time got home almost tears joints hurt bad. painful drive. body aches worse tested positive flu back 2016. couldn‚Äôt believe joint pain 10/10 would recommend totes again. also canceled infants cancer MRI last year due ventilator shortages. can‚Äôt go another season like looks like it‚Äôs slowly going happen state well. also pushed adult patients children‚Äôs Hospital.

First sort patients three sets: wait. die regardless. benefit help them. rank last set is. likely benefit service. Yeah noticed cities sub. It‚Äôs almost
Like group trying misinform people think dems would anti vax bs trump giving republicans would signing droves really coming hypothetically catching Covid. Something which, unless never leave house, control over‚Ä¶ love vaccine clinic deserve icu bunch articles Yeah seems like vaccination rates big part equation even country pretty low hospitalization transmission Delta arrived. Thanks pointing clear I'm saying Fauci wrong lock wanted bring attention different responses countries Delta. guess we‚Äôll wait people nursing homes vaccinated December start dying droves start giving boosters. 

The US can‚Äôt give vaccines away, they‚Äôll let people die let vaccine expire first proactive one time this.  disturbingly perfect virus. 

It's aggressively contagious long symptoms appear, symptoms largely invisible *do* appear, airborne, ways evading immunity late forces immune system ""oh shit"" mode, death rate high enough catastrophic low enough deceptively easy dismiss, mutates fast enough become real problem fast enough give enough urgency address it.

If wanted create virus lab disrupt entire world years, create SARS-CoV-2.

Oh wait... ^^just kidding ^^^mostly could also time doses longer Moderna DoD cannot mandate drug EUA (not fully approved) due [existing unless President overrides it. 

but condition: must declare override interest national security yet done so. FDA going fully approve vaccine soon moot President avoid backlash waiting FDA.

I think announcement SECDEF gentle reminder FDA also declaration contingency planning FDA follow timeline estimate. reasonable things do.  Legal reasons avoid lawsuits course. reason you‚Äôll see things like ‚Äúdo use bathtub‚Äù hair dryers. dad also got Pfizer whining recently won‚Äôt go back wearing masks ever. He‚Äôs 71 multiple comorbitities:(. bet he‚Äôd get booster though Biden also want lockdown would seem like defeat dealing pandemic, elected back brunch crowd wanted go back normal petite bourgeoisie life. That, plus bosses middle management want feel like mean something controlling people inside offices. think people held criminally responsible know manslaughter involuntary refuse wear mask amid evidence supports safety efficacy covid vaccine infected virus pass people people die think vectors virus spreaders held criminally responsible charge people criminal negligence manslaughter cases time much less. Child endangerment unsafe home life would first step removal children homes obviously kept safe protected parents vulnerable people society put risk elderly children reckless narcissist dangerous individuals talking freedom they're taking away everyone else's freedom. work curiosity needed move FL? wondering! Both. breakthrough cases among vaccinated people insignificant they're much probably going hospitalized 90% effectiveness mean 90% group people infected. means 90% people would gotten covid normal circumstances (like, period time) not. could start making kinds estimates assume every single person going wedding exposed days attending, that's pretty unlikely.

I know calculation want, know one. telling fire department can‚Äôt spray water fire retardant onto house, demand fire extinguished using single spray bottle. protection wearer. reason surgeons wearing masks isn‚Äôt one way guess triage would also mean insurance uninsured think would come play? Seeing treatment done United States person could sick disease virus people receive completely different treatments based insurance covers. see case probably going want treat uninsured people.

Of course not, that's point. people willing endure radical changes temporarily course whole lifetime? Malaria, AIDS..., problem is, impact poor young people Africa Asia purchasing power, European boomers.

This isn‚Äôt open issue either. several well established legal precedents regarding executive power lockdowns. 

Lockdowns considered viable governor president. insider advantage, I‚Äôm describing family KY. Wow. Well, hope power grid ready winter else problems. average person vaccinated likely educated gainfully employed, therefore likely exposed covid due professional familial obligations (read: kids school, mandatory work obligations public settings). know low-income communities negatively affected lot workers required work fast food, retail, etc., mention multigenerational households, especially middle high income families kids going back, definitely KNOWINGLY assuming risk...they don‚Äôt always choice.

Cowards idiots both. pushing vaccine mandates everywhere? want functioning fucking society.  Lol.


The Philippines never COVID control. reason shutting enough vaccines everyone.

Australia similar bet AztraZenca much fell behind buying Moderna Pfizer doses.

The difference examples, U.S. use adequate supply vaccines. That's Fauci says moot lockdown again. I‚Äôm checking go get tomorrow daughter. Desantis serial covid killer.  Get either. Shots arms matters most. Right, countries didn‚Äôt bring cases zero within 4-6 weeks lockdown unless started low number like New Zealand did. lockdown Wuhan quite long still lingering cases afterwards led mass testing city. 

My point it‚Äôs harder eliminate transmission short period time giving people money assholes.  yes agree interstate travel another big challenge. build beds want, Abbott allow funding staff them, they're useless. heard this. good place start primer? know answer perhaps time bring public shame back play. People used embarrassed believing stupid things. fucking banner.

We've 6 months tar, feather shaming. worked, may try something else? get sides work together. call Republican resurgence? I'm Indian. screaming couple months back warning guys get overconfident. many assumed ""vaccinations = end pandemic"" thing clearly going us *years*. Keep hospitals importantly staff falling apart. Especially stops dealing medical emergencies happen non pandemic times. Get state vaxxed tell 'em mask then, Abbott. love one mentions Northern hemisphere summer numbers already bad. Thanks politics ignorance many schools plan reopen optional masking. animal reservoirs? Oh 100% they‚Äôll still need quarantine procedures otherwise vaccinated people getting ports bring back ship described uncle lives Virginia. Delta virus mutates, becomes resistant vaccine, suffer along side. Win? That's big question last month two!

More evidence pointing waning immunity delta specific. instance, people vaccinated recently (with Pfizer) seem solid protection, even Delta. might well combination: Pfizer good vs. Alpha, good vs. Delta, good vs. Delta six months.

Edit: clarify, Pfizer still good vs Delta six months outcome interest hospitalization, severe disease, death. great preventing infeftion. deniers last year data back point.

Eh? IFR Covid 0.5% several times less people 50. known data time now. reasonable argument consider contagious virus 0.5% millions people still large number avoidable deaths. lockdown skeptics crowd wrong data back point. vaccines definitely effective preventing severe disease delta variant, vaccinated people catch transmit far higher rate acknowledged. means pre pandemic social behavior vaccinated people still lead thousands avoidable deaths people dying lobbies , people dying outside hospitals ? possibly need medical assistance oxygen slowly leaving body fluids begin drown people help busy helping dozens affected ??  people need hear refuse to. Miami-Dade says vaccinated 75% population, don‚Äôt know many covid infections it‚Äôs seeing state Florida doesn‚Äôt report county level data (that‚Äôs mayor Miami Beach said last week‚Äîperhaps changed, doubt it. Florida doesn‚Äôt like transparency). 

That said, understanding overwhelmed hospitals seeing record highs north Florida (particularly Jacksonville area). 

It definitely hot here, people inside more, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs entire story. Perhaps see happens gets cold north. 

It would really help Florida transparent.... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è misinformation literally costing lives. anti-vax crowds see that. y‚Äôall mad people aren‚Äôt getting vaccine need understand government - Trump Biden - made die street don‚Äôt continue work. Biden saying open everything up, turning back, everyone back school problem. That‚Äôs denialism. That‚Äôs insane position. countries previously COVID control high vaccination rates returning lockdowns? mentioned article, odd thing editorialize can't think any. That's great much important explain vaccines work.  Thanks OP here. I'm PhD economist, immunologist, cant speak science, statistical perspective, *skim* Mayo clinic report reads like pretty high quality work:

Obviously RCT, use propensity score matching, fairly well established reasonably reliable way controlling confounders (so long tons data, since matching process involves throwing tons data). Note confidence intervals wide for, e.g, monthly estimates efficacy, would think patterns month month consistent enough conclude reasonable certainty efficacy good first, wanes significantly 5 mos. pfizer moderna.

Edit: typo reference: entirety Germany (80.000.000 people) 10 deaths day. get corona, get corona. end day, I‚Äôm gonna let stop partying. fact it‚Äôs contagious means could potentially get sick going something that, months ago, wouldn‚Äôt worried about. don‚Äôt want get sick. less likely go (again).


My fear isn‚Äôt I‚Äôll hospitalized die. It‚Äôs really get sick lasting consequences currently poorly understood. Delta variant turned delta variant plus? Jesus they‚Äôre even stealing apples marketing trick   (actually)

\-ha immune problems *(as llergies ....)* 

\- .. long ... *just one day*

\- needed extra help... *just bad day* media coverage, almost think times - pandemic - never end. point though - guess question when? According article, 18 cases Delta Plus three hospitalized. Florida Department Health detected 18 cases Delta Plus, according latest report Aug. 6. Delta plus dominant strain state found least three people hospitalized. read this? doubting you, can't find reported anywhere. I've gone back self imposed lockdown home. I'll ride thing here, hopefully feel safe public end year. DeSantis = wannabe Trump think point key getting employers involved. full FDA approval companies feel comfortable putting requirements place. That's ""quite divide"".

Physicians large practice evidenced-based medicine. evidence comes scientists. That's physicians trained review interpret literature. That's 96% physicians vaccinated June 8 (pre-delta). 

Not mention large percentage physicians publish well, means....get this.... physicians Lot people medical field skeptics researchers alignment.

Okay, yeah, mostly physicians.  Stop watching news.. incentive keep afraid hooked. focus life family community. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Speaking someone training medicine immunology related fields, think article points loosely direction ""boosters, now!""

People say ""boosters work"" ""let's wait variant specific booster"" look study see Moderna Pfizer stuff; Moderna bigger dose. ""more"" may suffice, ""more, different."" 

Caveat: also studies saying mixing vaccines mrna either Azn JnJ produces especially robust response. That's different delivery, different strain though. anyone know protocol next step deal like what's going happen? Winter going tough, claiming ""all numbnuts wearing masks"" reactionary wrong, divisive well. Masks offer protection doubt, covid would around similar position without masks. Sure may slightly earlier later pandemic, marginally. I'm sure pandemic ends, end everyone starts wear mask every waking moment day. imagine grim would did. Subtle Try use time better health. Get shape. Take mindfulness. Eat better. Stop drinking drugs.

Even credible websites clickbait vomit nonsense. try best information confusing there.  One bus crash alone would put entire state Pickle tried GP? Seasonal mean one season....

Extreme weather, causing people indoors more, takes. occurs twice year, middle summer, middle winter.

North States get hit harder winter, southern harder summer, still see harsh weather part.  Someone who's already recovered Covid believes misinformation spread vaccine risks I‚Äôm sure covid wearing mask flu rates high staying home totally right? know made think argument vaccines. best guess future vaccines fully approved eruption vaccine mandates. places already probably nothing compared weeks now. Mandate employees students get vaccine don‚Äôt, work attend school somewhere else (most complain get shot). 

Until do, tell get tested everyday pay bills get Covid.It won‚Äôt get us 100% domestically globally, get us good majority. people vaccinated, less chance mutations like Delta overwhelmed hospitals. 

Just tired thanks delta follow rules someone never vaccinated. Remember commercials vaccines return normal? past pandemic part, mandate unvaccinated get tested workplaces daily basis, pay bills sick‚Ä¶ 

I still think vaccines work - fact extremely well. hope day comes don‚Äôt rolling restrictions mandates everywhere. sooner people get vaccinated, sooner get rid mask requirements live lives like pre pandemic.

The sooner get vaccinated, sooner put pandemic mask restrictions behind us good. Let‚Äôs end pandemic together - get vaccinated  Wow tiny effectiveness Moderna's vaccine infection dropped 76% July - Delta variant predominant - 86% early 2021. period, effectiveness Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine fallen 42% 76%, Kind like supersize fries please. people take damned thing seriously.

Between ""It's over! Normalize asap!"" ""It's big deal! 
 Normalize asap!"" we're getting... normalization. Though that's sides end ""why vaccinated, self-centered dumbass"" comes in.

If vaccinated within 2 months kids, careful another 1 month, probably finish time enjoy normal Christmas. won't. pair especially well misanthropy! Firstly, numbers wrong. 58.2% Americans one dose, 49.9% fully vaccinated. That's including ineligible (the largest group 16s).

Source: two-thirds (70.4%) people ages 18 older received least one dose vaccine 60.8% fully vaccinated.

So yes, well 70%+ eligible least one shot. Nice flex. anyone else back precovid 2020 anxiety mode? back addicted news covid spreading stressing sign sickness probably allergies (yes I‚Äôm vaccinated taking precautions) feel dark hopelessness simply untrue due delta pandemic really mess business. want done damn thing, following doctor recommendations fastest way get life. also mean people stronger side effect reaction Moderna? would enough actually shut 6-8 weeks doctors recommended.

No would have. It‚Äôs realistic expect entire population stay home. Aside real financial concerns associated mass layoffs (unfortunately can‚Äôt suddenly decide away oligarchy capitalism), would staff hospitals? would keep power on? would care people disabilities? settings like prisons outbreaks didn‚Äôt tests detect early could take long time controlled?

By mid-March 2020 (when large numbers experts starting calling shutdowns) transmission widespread enough country expecting every single infection chain die 4-6 weeks unrealistic. Also eradicating Covid global level even unrealistic would temporary victory anyway. idea shutdowns ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù protect hospital systems, eliminate virus done pandemic afterwards.  Knowingly spreading AIDs actual felony. well drunk driving. pack Karens appeared.

A pack Karens evolved School Board Lobbying Group! Except data showing vaccines effective keeping people hospitals preventing death. COVID deniers last year data back point. correct, missed they're Canadian Citizens. Although that's irrelevant fines/penalties issues falsifying documents. Floridian, that‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt really debate even pandemic. capitalist overlords fine still deaths medical bankruptcies. don‚Äôt get really sick get long Covid - something people constantly ignore. absolutely get delta strain vaccinated, viral load same, means vaccinated people spread it. living like it‚Äôs 2019‚Ä¶. governor psychopath likely gets rush knowing ability make decisions end persons life; proxy serial killer. Henry Kissinger thing: Scientists still think much critically average doctors know interpret data better. Definitely know doctors health care profession agree vaccinations. Lot people medical field skeptics researchers alignment.  think Florida mix problems big one it‚Äôs summer people going inside. 

You can‚Äôt really look population density state whole place like Illinois big density centered around Chicago. Chicago density 11.8k vs Miami 13.3k per square mile. Tampa Orlando 2.5k, Jacksonville even less. shows Miami denser much would cause discrepancy we‚Äôre seeing. testing basically stopped places too? (Caning Singapore legal penalty, done publicly.)  I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs conspiracy anything, headlines ‚ÄúX positives hospital‚Äù seem bit misleading they‚Äôre testing everyone even scan, visit reason. ""Most people died old comorbidities infections either mild asymptomatic"". always true Covid. different crowd using justify behavior.   sure delta. basing long one intensive care needs state 3 million+ people, y‚Äôall fine. BINGO! GOT CDC BINGO!

What win?? Oh fuck‚Äôs sake‚Ä¶. Drive house plant sign lawn next says something like ""because care them"" Letting grandma die okay, problem make sacrifices. 

&amp;#x200B;

But vaccines!! might much. Lord give sign do? real hard time believing people washing hands often careful touch.

But masking? Sure might perfectly anything catch cough droplets probably stopped lot airborne viruses cold. Where‚Äôs lie said though? completely understand caution. hope see soon. Nah, send fresh ones - can‚Äôt risk it. 

I‚Äôll take near-expiration booster though, let‚Äôs go!  Another risk, ages, long covid symptoms. Long covid debilitating. Symptoms shortness breath, brain fog, fatigue, persist year more. risk personally really see would another wave unless there's mutation severe natural immunity vaccines longer prevent it. You‚Äôre fucking idiot.  It‚Äôs happens people fear they‚Äôll mistaken liberal get vaccinated wear mask. I'm extremely interested similar studies J&amp;J, forgotten vaccine. :( Riiiiiip vaccinated get sick, current thinking spread easily, spread *for shorter period time*. Thus lowering total number people would infect. Thanks! friend described almost identical results. Perhaps true, [but also encouraging sign case-positivity rates stalled past week (albeit horrifically high levels).

Ofc much early say sure, I'd say cases test positivity % stalling week, there's least room cautious optimism LA might near peak Cases hospitalizations? following paragraph somewhat answered vaccines remain effective preventing COVID hospitalization**, Moderna booster shot may necessary soon anyone got Pfizer Moderna vaccines earlier year, said Dr. Venky Soundararajan Massachusetts data analytics company nference, led Mayo study.

But explain one effective though. Indeed went bar DTLA Thursday saw live music first time year half fucking ruled, even mask. things mask better last year could really walk around neighborhood. Don‚Äôt one sulky babies large percentage mentioned, go fun. Easier get drink less people bar. Yes. I‚Äôm vaccinated. People aren‚Äôt take precautions. Obviously‚Ä¶ Well, considering fast variant spreading, going another December 2020? know what's better mask? vaccine. Get one, stop hyping masks. Polio asymptomatic [95% got really widespread 5% lot people.

I think interesting we've collectively forgotten lot past pandemics. People forget lot skepticism first smallpox vaccine anti-maskers 1918 pandemic. think imagine everyone got page face clear danger lot history messier. Ok that's amount people hospital. That's much different asking ""how many people vaccinated end hospital"". Different set numbers I'd imagine probably falls somewhere around less 5% used gaiter outside mask required, otherwise n95 inside. Coaching soccer I‚Äôm 50 feet away anyone, required wear mask, seems like fine time gaiter. think CDC need better communication experts. Instead seeing results negatives, could promote vaccines giving people different options (strong reaction might get stronger result, get weaker reaction weaker result). Isn‚Äôt odd discrimination based vaccine status non-issue decades till Corona virus? remember getting college provide proof immunization.

My theory anti-Vaxxers colonies Corona virus disguise, probably sent crafty Dutch, disrupt vaccine distribution.  mean think I'll make judgement kind people considering I've known people I'm talking decades, point average anti-vaxxers think mmr vaccine gives kids autism think they're going get micro chipped. Far far it. know types people idiots pieces shit.

What hope accomplish anyone, let alone completely nuts kind logic? still idiot pieces shit they're convinced go get vaccine? get pass then?

Seriously, approach problem we're really fucked. ‚ÄúThe approval rushed‚Äù Thank appreciate this. wish could recall read this, months ago read article neck gaiters actually worse wearing mask all. something droplets small enough fit holes material added propulsion they'd get squeezed forced out. x100 even questioned? importantly every military person family member base received one ready?

However, worth stressing -- even among elderly -- vaccines extremely effective, particularly hospitalization death. reduction mortality reducing higher baseline. tired thanks delta follow rules someone never vaccinated. Remember commercials vaccines return normal? 

I‚Äôve seen comments like this, like‚Ä¶have y‚Äôall forgotten last year actually like? past Thursday went bar downtown Los Angeles watched friends band play, first live music I‚Äôve heard year half. felt pretty friggin‚Äô normal me.

I agree 100% everything else you‚Äôre saying though. takes wear compliance shit across board. 

It's fucking pandemic, airborne, viral pandemic can't even agree wear fucking mask.

Ridiculous.  Look around world,people vaccinated chances spreading virus around mention take hospital bed due ur mistakes someone else would suffer cuz won‚Äôt able get treated hospitals full..

Also people covid chances mutating  suspect lot spread coming kids. ton young children Austin they‚Äôve camps/other non-distanced activities summer. happened extended family pod - changed behavior cases started trend up, first child group infected delta early July got spread around. case parents vaccinated, kids didn‚Äôt get seriously ill, figured days us hung grandparents, thankfully. eligible population Austin least partially vaccinated (~75%) it‚Äôs tough statewide bans masks. I‚Äôve visited states pandemic, Austin 100% mask friendly Texas cities, Oklahoma, Kansas etc. fuck keep running ""story"" every like 4 days? useless number. Use one numbers actually logically scientifically supports vaccination. care infection reduce spread, people can't vaccinated due legitimate (not imagined) allergies vaccine ingredients, care people compromised immune systems vaccines effective, care hospital capacity unvaccinated people fill ICUs prevent elective surgeries procedures occurring, care level virus community relatively low vaccinated people unlucky reason another suffer serious infection. biggest unvaccinated groups included Republicans, rural residents, uninsured people younger 30.

That's worded oddly. know evidence suggest thing. new point time / large enough sample make determinations.  smallpox would infect person life. Coronaviruses infect people again..... . commonly theorized somewhere 70s, 

Are February? 

Because thats thing makes sense here. also totally disregarded immunity previous infection apparently

You get covid once. seem position mocking people theorized herd immunity

I well positioned mock you, considering said something stupid chain Given issues asymptomatic transmission evidence vaccines help reducing delta transmission, protection infection good.

Totally agree though care severe outcomes, long covid, hospital use, mortality, etc. build enough population immunity turn cold flu, protect remaining elderly, immunocompromised, risk regimen booster shots, antibody cocktails infection break through, etc., get lives. irony kids mind wearing mask. Small children mimic parents reactions tweens teens mind wearing masks. teenage daughters, feel strongly wearing masks protect others important. I'm immunocompromised they've always aware sick cold flu makes me. I'm proud caring others. Yes, want one. fuck social distancing.. parties fun. i'm gonna whatever want 4th that.

Obviously would also wear hospital care home, long wear supermarket could jabs also order online. IFR flu, one called arrogant going mask less people still died it.  neither.

Edit: forgot also disregarded one-dose immunity 10% higher, prior Delta (which period time we're talking here) commonly agreed provide pretty high level immunity itself, something like 65%. can't even keep track shit know. that's bad. upvote!  Same. sick maybe 15 hours. Like vaccines varies person person. many beds, people getting sick faster last time. vac rate isn‚Äôt high enough anywhere near herd immunity.   Thanks responding!

Your original statement objected focused doctors. Adding levels medical personnel moving extent involved research maybe clarify?

Academic hospitals exist nearly every major city. Residency programs usually require residents complete research training, frequently get published. may primary job docs, go onto things like really important vaccine clinical trials. also laughing like mad scientist got side effects. Bwahahaha, worked!  Big recent study JnJ. 71% obviously know shit what's going countries. could go detail allowed ask someones personal medical anything, literal nurses retirement home staff know explain it, considering i'm fucking nurse, youre worthless waste time. Probably, again... Anti-Vaxxers Conservatives exist. They‚Äôll drag shit another couple years want. bet he's win conservative vote reelection. piece shit mild hypertension, plus covid long hauler. issues pfizer. IMO clearly unethical waste limited resources people made choices decided suffer consequences Seems like might unique US. tried googling recent news articles concerning mask mandates schools several European countries, excluding words ""Florida"", ""Texas"", etc returned nothing interest. Symptomatic A-Symptomatic... Either way, potential spread others.

What exactly point? want Paxton punish nurses going traveling gigs calling price gouging. Let Abbott sink!! problem see theory timeline. indicated spike began less year pandemic isolation. completely unscientific conversations nearsighted people like estimate kids suffer year noticed. greater exposure parents would likely get symptoms recognized sooner. That's say spike impossible estimations current ""spike"" likely result earlier interventions many cases. Yeah, seasonal. new wave every season except Vaccination Spring.

The current one Summer Wave II: Delta Boogaloo. know, right since FDA approved. work live nation. vaccinated. covid. got work, live nation venue.  
So far, show requested restrictions venue. 
Pack hundreds/thousands people venue broken AC ventilation, mask/vaccine/test requirements, lots people get sick, like me. we've open month. Can't concert staff. Same. reaction all. still deceptive statistics. Really done regionalized/stratified per 100k vax status across symptom classes.

If said 400 Americans died plane crashes year 330 million, that‚Äôs kinda misleading. everybody eligible counted flown time period. 

The statistic isn‚Äôt necessarily flawed, it‚Äôs application it. It‚Äôs used say ‚Äúthis risk.‚Äù it‚Äôs however, it‚Äôs proportion vaccinated population breakthrough. can‚Äôt relationship probability breakthrough without influence attack rate (of infection). Unless number vaccinated people vaccinated exposed known p(infected|exposed, vaccinated) probability/risk breakthrough isn‚Äôt possible calculate Come y‚Äôall mean haven‚Äôt read chemicals household products may contributing obesity?

Everyone opted shot impacting mental health point. might *just* thing United States America(USA), seems prevalent anywhere else. nearly every case gets tested variant is, get numbers. got moderna absolutely wrecked 2 days. I‚Äôve (unknowingly time) around multiple people tested positive COVID right around haven‚Äôt gotten sick. know 6 people breakthrough infections J&amp;J. N=1 case obviously interesting seeing articles like play real time personal life going ask, order.  Speaking media looking Newsy Roku tonight. Graphic said: COVID cases surge among kids, whatnot. Surge surge surge, spike spike spike. I'm ready watch sports channels. üôÑ unvaccinated using lot hospital resources. Delta variant contagious that‚Äôs problem. wasn‚Äôt contagious wouldn‚Äôt nearly big deal. I‚Äôm making assumption unvaccinated likely anti-maskers mask = spread. great idea worry people leave negative reviews without visiting, seeing proof vaccination required sets lots people off.  It‚Äôs also really good point. Kids asymptomatic upon admission another reason tested positive wouldn‚Äôt life threatening position like title leads us immediately think. got first dose Pfizer today. like living want parents get sick. bad siblings selfish idiots refuse get vaccine. ""by large"" Also resident fellow conservative economic think tank. Everything says push reopening make rich money. Get Moderna. think something immune response everyone fam it. 14 16 yo Pfizer side effects despite hearing young people stronger response. say matter could tell body worked 2nd shot! God helps help themselves. think Fauci talking particular wave, no? we'd hit 200k+ cases? He's also risk-averse makes predictions. prefers prepare us worst.

But right. Humility wiser path. point gets missed vaccinated get infected spread rate. Vaccines still drop chance infection symptomatic spreader (which shouldn‚Äôt shocking anyways) Moderna side effects uncomfortable, knew working huge relief. much 2nd shot. It‚Äôs though. love hate crowd they‚Äôve vocal insufferable it‚Äôs limited long shot. can't covid get idiots like this? office still charging forward Labor Day return office Texas course. put two weeks today also got another job offer today working home permanently. Got small raise better quality life, good luck companies trying hang pathetic excuse control employees. Fair point. twitter continues reply news outlets saying they're wrong correct themselves, still refuse release ""correct"" numbers Well less hospitalizations future theoretically right people either gotten vaccinated infected right? 

Also vaccinations peak risen that‚Äôs good thing think he‚Äôs voicing government‚Äôs realization lockdowns aren‚Äôt realistic policy solution current spike due politics, probably won‚Äôt considered realistic solution future unless hospital systems really begin buckle large scale. admitted hospital 5 times course month non-Covid health issues. tested exactly ZERO times. FWIW, live Cook County (the 2nd largest county US). *Lambda entered chat* admitted hospital 5 times course month non-Covid health issues. tested exactly ZERO times. FWIW, live Cook County (the 2nd largest county US). See grain salt? took it. big one. Huge one. big drop foot, way big. barely lift grain salt. Wonder Pfizer booster would work me. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated Moderna 7 months second shot. He's asking come areas around Texas saturated longer send enough covid patients out. Right. That's horrific part: hospitals filling people themselves, people *regular* medical emergencies suffer this. Makes sense Dr. Fauci saying exactly opposite could get much worse. would think combination natural immunity vaccinations would pretty much end widespread hospitalization death pandemic many twists turns  people got vaccine ones taking hospital beds. They're much much much less likely require hospitalization rare event even contract covid.

Any issues hospital capacity fault unvaccinated, vaccinated. someone can't get vaccine legitimate health issues, going concert, unvaccinated, surrounded people vaccinated could carrying it. lemme get straight: disingenuous Covid hobbyist fakes concern immunosuppressed people gain leverage political opinion want score points online debates? come picking fight order teach lesson pick fights? Interesting world view there... Glad got one pfizer one moderna. Mix match! There‚Äôs widespread cases RSV paraflu going around kids right now.  kids happen get 3 once, it‚Äôs bad news them. Kids near wearing masks. Oh that‚Äôs even higher thought. Thanks posting this, however. testing friend's logic here:

Ought upset people want get vaccinated vaccinated citizens spread virus efficiently un-vaccinated? 

That is, certainly unvaccinated people taking greater (and unnecessary) risk lives, foolish, that's idiotic choice. argument also selfish may harm others continue spread virus. However, terms collectively helping nation, current research indicate likely spread COVID-19 vaccinated population? Therefore, they're really endangering themselves?

My best counterargument unvaccinated put undue pressure medical staff hospital infrastructure. However, apparently nothing harm sick, elderly, immunocompromised people vaccinated. 

Thoughts? Taco Deli! place garbage. food delicious, delicious. priced overblown. Won‚Äôt ever spend money shitholes again. ‚òùÔ∏èthat‚Äôs true.

Problem solved. Texas done that.  I'm nursing home hope covid takes agree let‚Äôs forget every vaccinated like running around without mask without symptoms spreading covid delta everywhere took 8 months get 50% vaccination numbers fraction peak. Combine 30% population country saying never get vaccine. Good luck ""final wave"" Thanks! J&amp;J seemed hardest side effects yet efficacy way less  right, OP asked people learning India's example, think perception Americans India why. kid turns 12 one month today. vaccine definitely near future. Moderna Keep phone case, like phone case. Assuming phone case opaque, course. One thing pisses blatant dishonesty articles. No, Delta causing new covid outbreaks, UNVACCINATED. FUCKING. PEOPLE. Novavax really good booster what's efficacy mixed BioNtech + moderna?

Asking Canadians. one hand, stuff like extremely discouraging, especially area nowhere near numbers public attitude. hand, explain India's metrics then? vaccination rate still quite low (sub 10% fully vaccinated even today, think) Delta came went within 2 months flatlined there, fairly low restrictions far know. 

It make lot sense super-highly-vaxxed city (with vaccine supposedly still works quite well Delta) masking can't control disease, one-tenth-as-vaxxed country lax restrictions seen case movement 6 weeks. took tylenol 24 hrs getting shot never came back. Fever hit night, really felt bad portion that, maybe 14 hours so. masks stop every unvaccinated kid getting infected spending multiple hours every day three months poorly ventilated room? plans, started W Bush maintained Obama. went crap starting 2017.

Blow-by-blow timeline here: main bullet points wife got Korean response ‚Äî contact tracing, consistent messaging, supply management, etc ‚Äî utterly failed administration. likely die birth control pills. mean honestly people.

Or least that‚Äôs I‚Äôve seen. Well Fauci CDC chirping older people underlying conditions getting believe.  numbers go know sure? ""Definitely positive"" cases tomorrow's numbers? would seem like counting twice can't it. kids cloth masks closed room six hours every day protect aerosols?

""what happening extensive nursing shortage, system across country, agency nurses unfortunately able name price, hospitals left options, fork money get nurses need take care patients"" great amount respect Korean government's response. handled pandemic wish US would have. 

Sadly little faith CDC well federal government comes pandemic. even plan? now?

The US gov. recent mixed messaging happened early last year well. keep backtracking advice. Remember Fauci saying masks help gave government time corner N95 market? see lost faith continue listen question whatever say. 

It's enlightening embarrassing see federal state government bureaucratic systems continue fail us. real eye opener me. Account 1000x viral loads delta strain tell whether masks still effective. Going one min five minutes helping lot. Going one hour five hours does. Finally, convince them. /s  Delay ELECTIVE PROCEDURES?! gonna sit well wealthy donor class. Brave man! /Sarcasm could cross state borders get third shot high risk past close six months. 

This initial lying public mask scenario CDC/Fauci did. don‚Äôt want scare hesitant people getting first shot. countries EU booster shots Id follow them. vaccine doses (Moderna) around 8am. Didn‚Äôt hit till 7/8pm night. Felt awful, like flu, muscle aches (even toes ached) sweating overnight felt bad lunchtime next day. dinner 80%, back 100% next day. second dose worse. 

I also idiot worked out, ran errands, worked day second dose, thinking electrolytes would magically make everything better. 

Would gladly take another dose needed. Wouldn‚Äôt work run around day injection, though. Next time I‚Äôll take easy. Less 14% earth unvaccinated, like 5 Billion people.

Also animals function reservoirs billions billions unvaccinated animals. White tailed deer US contracting sars covid 2

Totally back normal like nothing ever happened good nap day. husband also got Moderna experience. rarely gets ill fever body aches never happens man practically crying mama 2nd vax. said it‚Äôs turn booster. question. Hey, look, rerun Living Texas just... great! What's love held hostage senator! /s really crazy italy government said restaurant owner must ask ID, check customer green pass not.

This beyond dumb, since people pass green pass friends simply sharing via whatsapp whatever. far recent reading research goes, vaccinated unvaccinated same.

I wish could find article (Yale?) basically said vaccine stops virus propagating bloodstream. COVID spread blood-to-blood contact. virus enters nasal passages, happens mucous membranes vaccinated people contain much COVID unvaccinated people. believe article stated something effect ""phase one keep people dying, successful. phase two stop virus spreading well."" Right none vaccines darned thing stop delta spreading.

Therefore: spreading vaccinated people = spreading unvaccinated people. Fuck TX

-Lyin‚Äô Ted Citation 70%?  Moderna Here, fairly complex medical history. Dose 1 dragging semi functional 5 days. Headache, chest pain, heart arrythmias. Dose 2 laid completely 5-6 days. Chills, fever, body aches, headache, exhaustion- way fatigue, sore arm. told one Dr's that's controlled vaccine made feel, Covid probably would killed me. I've septic/septic shock ... I've desire repeat experience- I've heard people compare two similar rip apart body. thank you. would get shots tomorrow too. Pleased meet you.
I hoped guess name. Thanks. something concrete discuss. Surgical masks buy 60 min protection parties use one. many hours going keep unvaccinated kids classroom every single day? single kid remains uninfected time FDA authorizes vaccine miracle. That‚Äôs mean. Uh... Australia done compared US even controlling population size? I'm sorry hear :( need happen. one thing that's proven, again, beyond shadow doubt, throughout entire course pandemic, one thing would trusting people ""do right thing"" ""behave responsibly"" work. all. Ever. Church non-essential lol. Reddit. reported high 90%'s seeing. 80-90% range us. one medium sized system among several thousand. I'd love updated ETA children's vaccines. hope too! Something tells while. 

It's hospital administration supposed do. don‚Äôt think anyone saying wont need boosters. question when. don‚Äôt want blow load early it‚Äôs still pretty effective don‚Äôt want wait long. Anyone who‚Äôs gotten vaccine feel pretty good things still. said soon get go ahead I‚Äôll line get it. give ID back April. Maybe different now.

*I actually remember show ID asked name appointment. drive thru put county health department. Indeed Fricken Sturgis going right now. delta pot getting stirred government made hard opt receiving child tax credit year

Wait. Opt receiving free money? fuck. really. Never heard admit we‚Äôd multi-year pandemic, exactly what‚Äôs happening. look San Francisco rates health department: vaccine uptake variability really high, thanks Trump republicans. focus local things really count me. Everyone thread complaining Texas, federal bill would prohibit federal government issuing mask vaccine mandates. affect Texas directly exactly zero percent chance becoming law. Yes, sponsored Ted Cruz, also sponsored Senator Cramer North Dakota. pure political theater base. read study vaccines erratic drops. Moderna dropped 62% month ago recovered following month. month, Pfizer effective.

Is perhaps variables test vaccines different times different situations (more Delta etc)? Yet, probably could similar data available albeit Moderna slight edge. Either way, US prep boosters Moderna soon possible safe. Thanks info. didn‚Äôt even know option. call around tomorrow. 

How long results one? give ID insurance. Make name walk in. Problem thought would go away year so. Reality kicking in. We're war could last much longer imagine. hand, get shit together, perhaps stand ground. Thanks! Could worse yeah! used drained exercising something almost daily last couple years. I'm gonna cynical - Trumpists stopped caring economy moment Trump left office became ""Biden's economy""

In fact, would bet would happily tank economy meant Biden Dems tougher shot getting re-elected going mandate N95? not, security theater. mandate something, vaccinations. Republican knees jerk like Parkinson's. Don‚Äôt really care schtick is, he‚Äôs right anyone. Good luck 50. Lived worked Vancouver ten years, stupidly get citizenship. Biggest regret life. it! worked pretty hard get 9 obtainable moderate running every week. Well find week do. 

I live around many spreadnecks. nurse, it‚Äôs point. gimme 100+/hr ü§ë Well, richest countries donating World Bank get funds task, hope best. won‚Äôt COVID free long aren't. Wearing mask prevent getting car 

I wish did, could watch bunch people whine right want get car crash individual choice (i.e. GUY, MORON).   need 60% disinfecting surfaces, surface transmission primary way spreading. uncle full vaccinated retired US military TON problems border couple days ago trying drive camper stuff Alaska family. wanted sleep mandatory hotels (instead camper) go ton hoops randomly decided would allowed daughter ‚Äútry tomorrow‚Äù. 

They process moving WA Alaska camper full valuables, guns, dogs‚Ä¶ easy stay hotels preferring stay self contained stop anywhere except gas. right time, right time say decades ago. guess do, thanks news one hospital group CEO talking 250 nurses short already, hire temp agency nurses cover gaps. Apparently going rate nurse $268/hr there. Supply demand guess. literally insane. Could obvious using pandemic political goals public education system? I‚Äôll totally move New Zealand work, apply? Ma‚Äô Fre‚Äôd‚Äôm!!! Pandemic going on? Let's fight virus, let's fight things could help us fight virus. Let's ban tool chest limit virus. abuse power. he? Link? never said didn't. simply asked refuse hospital beds people life choices, others. Many obese people take hospital beds simply obese. Save beds responsible people. Man don‚Äôt know think ex wife husband. good conversation, mostly around getting 13 y/o son vaccine (I‚Äôm it, she‚Äôs against) things husband believe odd.

She thinks govt created COVID money power.

That vaccine rushed shouldn‚Äôt used.

That COVID deaths people underlying issues really death COVID.

That government made hard opt receiving child tax credit year (it took 7 mins most) face scanned us take control.

It doesn‚Äôt make sense kids get dosage vaccine adults would.

End conversation let‚Äôs go doctor see suggest, continues tell ok first shot second one.

How combat stupidity. delta variant changing that. Last time heard 1,000 kids ICUs across country. happen first time around Freaking LOVE cold, actually. haven‚Äôt slightest clue immigration works‚Ä¶.wouldn‚Äôt work certain desirable field? realizing 30 I‚Äôve never actually contemplated (for real) leaving country. would, point. What‚Äôs scary half neighbors don‚Äôt seem care. There‚Äôs large divide people it‚Äôs becoming harder harder reconcile. People aren‚Äôt willing make small sacrifices greater good. Who's saying anything afraid keeping permanent sense despair aside you? Seriously. aware aware. aware afraid aware afraid. afraid afraid. 

I think people say stuff like ones really scared. feel you. parent tough, unless bury head sand pretend it‚Äôs happening like people know. another year remote learning outside home district grade schooler. It‚Äôs tough choice feel kind crazy matter do. Seriously fuck Delta, close. Maybe they'll come around like did... Triage works point.

If hospital 1000 beds 1000 people show Covid, send 950 home, put 15 ICU 35 general. 

The problem is, tomorrow, 1200 show Covid. 1400. 1600. Eventually, 1000 beds 1100 people sick Covid. meantime, people still heart attacks getting cancer falling ladders stuff.

That happen mass casualty event - 20 car pileup another one another on... don‚Äôt change behavior now, we‚Äôll f‚Äôed months.

I guarantee vaaaaaast majority vaccinated individuals f‚Äôed months. False.

Nowhere claim ""supposed approved already"" rather said sufficient data fir aproval alresfy, fact is.

The hyoer cautious extend trial approach one pushed MORINS whinignore dekta lot dangerous disease last spring.

But they're covering oetsinal asdrs, deathscftom covid card - even though inactuonniscdirectly blame. ...come dude. really think people vaccinated point (ie hardened anti-vaxxers) ever going wear mask, let alone extremely uncomfortable difficult fit N95? think Dr. Brilliant, yeah that's name, epidemiologist, better gauge what's going happen. Gottlieb GP, turned politician. Plateaued slowly increasing. think little people unvaccinated

I think little people obese. Overconsumption cause society's problems. Ok fuck it. I'll bite. Explain decided get vaccine. I'm thankful stands little chance passage Didnt get last time said bullshit, gonna get time either. No, unfortunately that's possible, live Iran, uncle cousins still there. really frustrating since we're vaccinated feel like get sick probably die. really bums cause hope somehow he'll pull through, mean ICU instead he's laying bedroom fighting thing :/ every mask half measure, mean cumulative benefit significant

unless disposing professionally fitted N95 mask literally every time put take off, medical professionals like surgeons ever actually 100% agree you. don‚Äôt know go‚Ä¶was thinking CO family genuinely don‚Äôt know do. 

I‚Äôm 6th generation Texan. husband tried everything right since March 2020. We‚Äôre vaxxed. significantly changed lifestyle, quit job went remote able keep kids virtual school last year. actually isolated better part 18 months. whatever takes keep kids healthy.

Now state leaders us? kids?!? fearful what‚Äôs coming. breaking heart. also, colder Texas. might competition Abbott Variant.  lol

I think little people unvaccinated, I'm asking change lifestyle, eating habits way life, like obese person would do. get injection arm takes minutes they're done.

So comparing unvaccinated obese same. seem understand everyone obese chose obese. insidious, creeps you. may think simple decision, said earlier unless obese never understand.

Okay, I'm done. good night. seems rumblings ‚Äúmid-winter‚Äù mark going school-aged kids. us babies, toddlers, preschoolers likely continue holding collective breath. 

‚ÄúPfizer said statement NBC News anticipates results clinical trials kids ages 5 11 sometime September, could apply emergency use authorization. ""Data kids 2 5 could arrive soon that,"" company said, adding results kids ages 6 months 2 years may released October local mean state?  source 93 day? find it‚Äôs around 90 week. know I'd teacher, I'd try really hard find job would enforce mask mandate (say private school). meantime, I'd using sick paid time job searched let's see many substitutes find. Translation: ""I valid counter point because, despite saying argue, continue respond."" talking someone mid July Arkansas 500 people hospitalized. said worrying number gone 250 mid June 500 mid July. reply 500 state 3 million. big deal. ü§¶ said look deaths.. flat.. said something like.. media scaring us.. etc etc.. stopped listening point. Nothing good old voter suppression can't fix them. Wooooo Moderna gang!!!!! Suck Pfizer bitches!‚Ä¶. Haha jokes please really want everyone get vaxxed faith humanity restored I‚Äôm desperate. Please remember comes time vote, please vote. I‚Äôm sorry. idea would ever support. I'm thinking far government could possibly go far forcing individuals things may want order try beat virus. force vaccine public, what's stop forcing mandates may public ""interest"", yet go individual rights? Lol downvoted? Completely true. ‚ÄúYou guys fucking idiots tell you‚Äù usually doesn‚Äôt end people going ‚Äú know idiot, I‚Äôll exactly told me, thanks‚Äù Read last post again. Slowly. Twice to. I‚Äôm sure someone gave tip days ago sort new, show lot non-US flaired posts don‚Äôt make top. loser even relevant anymore?? Vote hell out!! Question: Green Cross 40% Isopropyl alcohol good corona? man clearly hates texas, power grid falls apart goes vacation, State suffers dramatic covid surge petitions Mask vaccine mandate ban ?

I'm big believer **Actions speak louder words ,** man hates Texas politically convenient moment something else pays well I'm sure he'll'' throw darts Texans way he's spineless coward clearly never sees source problem.

He strong sense family, country, duty, I've never used word ""feckless ""before image definition think feckless individual would . Vaccination without consent? fuck assholes getting ? Canada open applications immigration Eric Feigl-Ding's number? got 2 Pfizer Feb/Mar. First shot felt nothing, second tired next day. got 3rd, opted Moderna (went different state vaccine system yet). really tired days 2-4, slept afternoons, also mild muscle aches. Think might fever third night.  Fine afterwards. American, remember phrase ‚Äòmy rights end begin‚Äô drilled head civics class. Thanks, mr. Marcoaldi. herd immunity one way Don‚Äôt worry, South Dakota‚Äôs governor surely ask everyone pray children pretty soon, help. definitely helped floods 2 years ago /s ""Sounds like something debate next six months!""-FDA CDC don‚Äôt tell won‚Äôt getting single dime money. Check doctor, probably shouldn‚Äôt get vaccine you‚Äôre ill. Get tested get vaccine you‚Äôre feeling better.  Also companies want cheap deal convention space. predictions would last solid two years back March 2020, I‚Äôd agree, Spring 2022 realistic point.  Look long took southern leaders accept pellagra nutritional deficit.

And case, dietary change would show results short time. would actual dream, tbh. living nightmare here. getting injection arm?

You claimed unvaccinated people refused hospital bed lifestyle decisions. make claim obese people lifestyle also seem need last word lol

You stop responding time. choice yours. elitist attitudes mostly reason going getting point. first didn‚Äôt go get wasn‚Äôt really advertised anywhere wasn‚Äôt super afraid covid didn‚Äôt aggressively seek vaccine, way everyone already gotten acting towards us don‚Äôt kinda scare whole ‚Äúbeing last guy picked gym class‚Äù thing tell everyone already got don‚Äôt freak me. put press release saying Texas Department State Health Services going use staffing agencies bring healthcare workers states, sounds like can‚Äôt cheap (and relies workers needed states they‚Äôre from). end wave, likely virtually every unvaccinated person infected. point, everyone immunity, disease neither threaten hospital system lead mass death.

But toll take health care providers hospital staff? end game virus run course people unvaccinated, that's asking awful lot frontline health care workers keep burning risking health. say nothing variants arise virus continues spread. Texas Republicans probably trying scare Democrats Texas time putting Texas Republican voters risk dying. Masked, yes. Unmasked vaccinated people? suppose could say yes too. Anybody covid spread easily anybody else infectious stage - difference is, stage shorter people vaccinated. Come Canada!  spoke candidly experience said people got real look pandemic, would get vaccinated.

Eventually, somebody going snap start leaking video. likelihood getting infected decreased 85% (mRNA vaccines), preventing spread. everyone vaccinated, anyone spreading 85% less chance catching infection, 95% chance hospitalized, even great chance dying. 
There's world argument statistically makes sense. ignoring everything calculating risk, decisions potentially undesirable outcomes.  it‚Äôs late that. Maybe late winter/spring last year could case decided give vaccinated end pandemic early card carriers incubators virus incubate virus, virus likely start mutating evade vaccine. 

If don‚Äôt change behavior now, we‚Äôll f‚Äôed months. solution simple. Get vaccine perish/starve/become homeless. Survival fittest. Old school rules.  keep looking what‚Äôs keeping us low cost living used highlight along less sprawl. It‚Äôs getting harder harder justify though Yes do. Apparently must think little people don't, least responses.

What getting injection arm? Apparently instant gratification right thing enough? Protecting people well enough? feeling good citizen enough?

You also seem need last word lol Europeans handling school situation kids? remote? Full attendance masks? Partial attendance? masks required? http://www.rapidtests.org good resource best.  That‚Äôs posted link. really informative documentary.üòÉ

But answer questions. Yes first question. look almost carbon copy war top well. people coped probably far worse now. coped nonetheless time. choice.

And regarding flu virus several years roaring 20s, reminds right now. Look festivals parties going on. mention flu virus running rampant mutating like crazy.People didn‚Äôt care. sick tired isolating wearing masks years. said screw it. Everything time exactly now. must human thing suppose. People wanted live lives opportunity. suffered constant intermittent outbreaks.

Eventually 11 years virus simply ran steam point. still people weren‚Äôt dying much. mutated manageable condition.

Like said Flu vaccine didn‚Äôt arrive little decade later.

Check link. üëç Jesus Christ, Texas. Please better betrayed yet ?  still god damn hot balls. 105+ heat indexes fucking suck.  ‚ÄúThanks vaccinations natural immunity Americans recovered COVID-19, America reopening. America recovering, kids going back school, small businesses returning nation's economic heartbeat. time, President Biden imposing unscientific burdensome mandates control Americans' lives.‚Äù

124k cases yesterday. fucking planet dude live on? country (germany) fucking sucks vaccinating people hurts mod lock. can't see thread going anywhere break sub rules. asked ID days ago getting second shot walgreens Well, children 12-15: Pfizer submitted request EUA FDA April 9, 2021. FDA approved Pfizer's EUA May 10, 2021, shots started going arms week. 

What going different younger kids 2 things:

1. data review. 2 months follow-up data requirement 12-15 age group (just like adults), versus 4-6 months data younger groups. data likely means time required review.
2. FDA also announced younger age groups, approval would go advisory committee - 12-15 group go committee. Ultimately, Advisory Committee Immunization Practice CDC make recommendation. knows long going take. sure Star Wars fan, think Han's quote ""There's time discuss committee!"" fits here. need get Covid test get shot. sure would good thing get vaccine time early Covid. Selfishness extreme. Decades broken education system compounded Many people little information spare time get vaccine: migrant workers work Tyson. Hmm. hope facilitating employees getting shots mandating them.  counter argument would rather anybody medical training take care nobody able fired. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs black white situation, I‚Äôm claiming know answer. It‚Äôs obviously good staff vaccinated, obviously would bad ever need staff. Moderna got sick almost week! needle like pain body, slept couple hours time first 2 days. like alcoholic asking kegeragor rehab room.

Sadly, states refuse aid unless he's willing actually stuff mitigate spread state. drain resources (which probably going need) help someone gun aimed foot?  I've two doses Pfizer nothing sore arm. friends, family, neighbours work colleagues also vaccinated (in UK surprising). one anything sore arm. guess that's norm exception. It‚Äôs early feel good fatality numbers. Hospitals filling way up. someone explain three-quarters (74%) reported breakthrough cases among seniors age 65 older. roughly 1,500 people died, one five passed away something Covid-19 even though breakthrough case virus, according CDC.

How one five die something covid-19, COVID-19. One 5 randomly fucking die. Yes, replied another comment left information. include families, talking hundreds thousands people directly impacted indirectly impacted emotional distress. nation, spent time mourning roughly 3000 deaths caused World Trade Center collapse. nearly two orders magnitude worse happening slower less people recognize real.

I wouldn‚Äôt want person can‚Äôt follow (basically simple) medical advice work medical field. would end harm good.  important didn‚Äôt make mistake getting vaccinated first place. vaccine free? till mid October? That‚Äôs bullshit. Give two week. Honestly, sounds like Facebook pseudoscience. There's way small mesh would somehow propel airborne droplets faster completely unimpeded. Ever Boebert‚Äôs district? Call CPS scum! came pass, many people sub would disappointed along NBC, CNN, AP, New York Times. rate I'm sure much point plant workers getting vaccinated November. Thats sad. mix unvaccinated adult babies actual sick children. day green lit kids appointments. phone siblings getting nieces nephews appointments. kids want hug cousins. guy smart name literally Mr. Brilliant. Sure.... soon issues mask mandate.

He damn part instead telling healthcare workers take one team step asking hospitals postpone procedures.. hey guess what.. due strain already are.  vaccines still effective part right?  Unions long keep open vials? Well take CNN. ones reporting potentially misusing data. prefer read news organizations put go look myself. like hard find.  many cases spread around county though. lack secure border exactly great pandemic.

Either way, it‚Äôs frightening. course are... CDC full politicians, scientists  love masks become ""freedom"" ""parent's choice"" issue.

we still wear seatbelt... still wearing masks! entire state? Holy fuck. Biology maybe important class school. Sooner later need life choices.  Call whatever want, still want get it. sounded unpleasant that's putting lightly. I'll take normal civy vaxes quiet. Unvaccinated herd immunity thing imagine people striving for. probably cost half million lives that's gotta aim.

The horror...the horror... High heart rate like simply fighting virus case vaccine. Also anxiety too. Ya know, freedom. People willing die economy last year assholes take shot. I've really curious Europe feels/felt Delta. Like people go supreme leader Iran medical advice DeSantis‚Äô kids wear masks fucks sake  one staff though. temporary morgues. state surge already?

The state already much sharper rise higher peak last summer's surge. 

Good thing hospitalizations deaths seeing rise, although still going up. people know getting COVID though got case assume Delta. started gastric symptoms I've reasons, even consider could Covid 5th day cough test 6th day confirmed. Second dose Pfizer back April. I'm sure would much worse gotten jabs. Interestingly, 10 days start symptoms symptoms almost right money. goes show talking 330 million people, fraction percentage result hundreds thousands victims. Every single one people families also affected indirectly emotional distress. really national tragedy account people directly indirectly impacted.

That's get angry people refuse recognize fact. It‚Äôs experience observation majority people see wearing masks wearing correctly. stupid plan science behind NO.  
Get fucked. pissed corporations want retain employees lose money. still going happen.  


Good job. Fewer deaths per day time summer Delta final boss. It‚Äôs going get approved Labor Day. ""Exposed?"" think vaccinated unvaccinated person get exposed virus, similar viral load nasal passages, easily spread onward there. difference vaccinated person less likely get ""infected"" (symptomatically ill?) much much less likely get seriously ill, vaccine helps immune systems kill virus bloodstreams (wheras unvaccinated protection, vaccine multiply unimpeded bloodstreams). Big, cheap, poorly constructed housing comes cost. Meanwhile, here‚Äôs saying US last year:

‚ÄúIf look masks buy drug store, leakage around really much protect you. People start saying, 'Should start wearing mask?' Now, United States, absolutely reason whatsoever wear mask."" - Dr. Anthony Fauci, February 2020

‚ÄúSeriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS! effective preventing general public catching #Coronavirus‚Äù - US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, February 2020

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs reason walking around mask. you‚Äôre middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it‚Äôs providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences ‚Äî people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.‚Äù - Dr. Anthony Fauci, March 2020

‚ÄúThere specific evidence suggest wearing masks mass population potential benefit. fact, there‚Äôs evidence suggest opposite.‚Äù- Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director health emergencies program, March 2020

‚ÄúYou increase risk getting wearing mask health care provider‚Äù - US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, March 2020

If wonder many people US doubt ‚Äúexperts,‚Äù why. research readily available back proved masks worked, zero evidence showed contrary. flip-flopped ‚Äúthe science changed,‚Äù mask shortage ended. hid behind fake science push policy. 

And history repeating right eyes. experts flip-flopped ‚Äúvaccinated individuals can‚Äôt spread virus don‚Äôt wear masks‚Äù ‚Äúactually keep wearing them.‚Äù Again, science changed, cases rise. use shield ‚Äúscience‚Äù push public policy feel greater good. Need ration masks? ‚ÄúMasks don‚Äôt work!‚Äù Want encourage vaccinations? ‚ÄúVaccinated don‚Äôt wear masks!‚Äù Cases rising quickly? ‚ÄúJk vaccinated spread too! Mask up!‚Äù

Yeah much every life matters  Irony died Nov 2016, RIP. Idk nurses union reason fighting hard hospital mandating vaccines hope he's right, predictions wrong lately Utter nonsense Real question, always 70% effective wouldn‚Äôt 30% cases always breakthrough? That's I'm at.

The risks fluctuate depending much community. clear enough spread worse enough environment, increase chances infected massively vaccinated person (Provincetown).  genuine ‚ÄúI Spartacus‚Äù moment.

People forget vaccines work immune system already mounts strong response, takes small nudge make prepare. make immune aren't.

Reactions vaccines vary. partner got morderna shots.

First one us: sore arm, much else

How bad Delta? UK think ending pandemic. Government done away masks social distancing.

I get it. Why? people willing vaccinate removed gene pool. Canadian Pfizer first shot Moderna 2nd.

Pfizer owned 2 days. moderna shot gave sore arm 2 days it. Wait. What? lie approved? I'm EMS high exposure would like hit Moderna go 9 month old Pfizer. Moderna here. second shot felt like would die. unable lie couch 2 days. Could barely eat soup wife made me. third day gone like never anything wrong first place. 

Super weird, 1/10, would take again.  says buy? would suggest renting situation. Absolutely, governments failing us. find India‚Äôs current vaccination rate unacceptable. Look fast China caught surpassed US. covid response plan? No. I've paid close attention since January 2020 never heard anywhere, except people believe real.   joke? governors, senators House representatives actively fighting plan every step. Honestly? Probably not, Delta incredibly infectious burned available hosts next 8 weeks so, like India. Yay? cares federal employee requirements is. impact everyone else?

Agree, trumps idiot, disagree judged inaction. I‚Äôm still waiting San Antonio catch  Pfizer shots, 30s/M, relatively easy. little tired first time around second almost nothing. guess I‚Äôm fucked.

But nah, freedoms, go trump, guess. explains Moderna's stock shooting moon long exposure wait test? feel like incubation period Delta shorter? (Vaccinated unsure sniffles something else. 3 days exposure) Pfizer produce smaller vials American market. wrong. 100 percent people died alive Almost like it‚Äôs pandemic something. wonder many people 10 11 year old kids lying ages getting vaccinated? understand idea someone better nobody better, it?

The problem staffing, granted working hypothetical problem (disease carrier work vs nobody work). problem medical personnel going one patient another say unvaccinated person could save life least make patient feel better, great. think patients take vaccine (a high likelihood). reasonable people dont blame trump lack action, blame actions often dangerous detrimental population. Hes guy suggested injecting bleach disinfectants body cure covid. man actively worsening situation almost every way could.

And add: *is* distancing mask mandates federal employees iirc.  Good. Hope see FL districts defy Ronnie next.   right thing.  Yeah honestly need wear seat belt. government business telling enforcing it. right die want to.  Put antivaxers tents smarter ones inside Trust anti-vaxxers behind times. I‚Äôm trying get feel measures others taking, anxiety questioned whether I‚Äôm reacting others around reacting. I‚Äôm vaccinated, always wear masks around people. wanted know others starting (or continuing) isolate last spring? would top. Happy see top comment. plenty stats used show effectiveness vaccines one them. know, triple dose match Moderna doesnt impact population regular basis, show that, federal level, least executive branch, covid actually treated care demands, starting, seen, changes also take hold legislative judicial.

How effective feel ""example treat covid"" changing people's behavior?

I mean argumentative. trying highlight covid epidemic seems infectious administration, saying politician really positive negative measureable impact conjecture. virus continue mutate survival. think capability smart/plan it, viruses part ecosystem founded from.

Yes, medically eradicated many illnesses, soon one, might humble occasion realize Republicans stubborn mask, democrats trying dramatize crisis blame. virus killing people. people killing people.

We one day aligned thought, organized execution, prevail nefarious opponent. yet. currently blame other. virus care continues quest survival. holding giant panties pic? Oh boy, ""we see more"". Aha. numbers? actual numbers. ""More"" also mean 0 1. buy it. American media known fearmongering. say forgot, want supply privacy reasons. Walgreens require ID Houston, problem sign get booster presumably means numbers previous days undercounted. 7-day average graph would account shooting right too. local news story post-COVID condition isolated one child. said seeing cases COVID-19 psychosis. blame increase infectious Delta variant. Emergency room physician Dr. Michael Daignault said he‚Äôs seen COVID psychosis before, usually adults long-haulers. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre learning something new COVID every day,‚Äù Daignault said. 
According Daignault, COVID-19 psychosis tends show sooner children. Daniel‚Äôs onset condition came one month contracted coronavirus.

And getting unofficial booster, saving lives people otherwise end hospital. turn CVS get covid jab questions asked? UK there's whole process checking getting logged registered etc.

I'll states near future would half-tempted get booster simple. Well sucks hear, want point anecdotes like mean nothing big picture. scary part reddit comments like inevitable upvotes make sound like everyone mother gets Covid despite fully vaxxed.  first phizer vaccine yesterday, felt drugged stoned good night sleep feel back normal  sounds like fucking awesome night exactly need this. article one special case. bo evidence cases. calm down. looking Glad hear ok intelligent enough take vaccine means going doctor normally would might influence people get vaccine, uninsured positive influence, even vaccine free. Hope helps China already uses it. Singapore while. Afaik reason Singapore stopped using issues getting reliable sample. Patients can't drink eat hard control generate 4ml saliva takes couple minutes. Yeah, 1 person sad story. Wanna hear stories 4.2 million people died far worldwide? I'm sure 200 million+ cases infection worldwide filled fun times!

Also, who's saying care hundreds get blown Africa?  likely fine. Nothing risk-free. sub biases cautious, fine. Wear mask.

My concern vector (carrier) vulnerable unvaccinated family member friend. bad though. heard vaccine get serious illness right? ask comorbidities health issues? state gots big dick energy wish would well. I'm boat you. keep waiting clear ahead get second jab. Yes, exactly clear different sources checked overlap unvaccinated deaths (0.184%) hospitalizations (0.058%), regardless vaccinated number includes I've seen presented apparently &lt;0.005% 

(Even adding reported adverse events associated vaccine, fatal get XXXX%, [0.0005% anaphylaxis, &lt;0.0003% TTS mostly concern women 50 J&amp;J/non-mRNA, 0.0011% GBS limited J&amp;J mostly men 50, 0.0007% myo/pericarditis mostly affecting male adolescents 0.0019% deaths causally linked Even treating conservatively (scientifically, politically), would additional 0.0045% risk. 99.99% / 0.01% numbers widely reported vaccinated hospitalizations and/or deaths essentially includes vaccine complications and/or deaths rounding error. ask comorbidities health issues? mean also lambda Honestly, glad guys figured way prevent appears significant amount death/illness.

I admit early lockdowns continual management prevent exposure thus prevent effectively outbreak. problem difficult understanding needs done, make happen, get people comply, confirm success relatively short time period.

Kudos state figuring unlike world. sources this. got J&amp;J keep reading conflicting reports state wait second jab. Honestly I'd rather another jab, ass days boosts chances long run inevitably come contact covid.  exit strategy 

When comes pandemic, feel we've collectively shouted *MISSION ACCOMPLISHED*... three times far? time look canadian real estate That‚Äôs good approach. Hmm I'd suggest look history. Humans never cared. Moderna vaccine mainly produced used US. increased production EU, still like around 10% doses used

UK, Israel main countries constantly publish new data vaccine efficacy use Moderna vaccine Welcome end time law makers nothing internet trolls. would've hilarious White House Twitter account got banned wonder 12 week gap doses countries affects this, getting second Pfizer time gap here. Heard increases antibodies lot. speak young couple got Moderna shots together, 1st dose came nasty arm pain/tenderness, 2nd dose day flu-like symptoms (nothing gastrointestinal us thankfully) aches, headache, chills. next day fine again. trevor moore died accident last week? Would mean Oklahoma full also? Lol Texas. Idiot GOPers must proud pulled calculator months ago suspected losing next election due deaths, i'm even confident now. Crispr13 detection easily used dip stick type reader. choice cleaving fluorophore quencher minor detail. may give slightly quantitative result though. calls wife virus would keep spreading even borders shut down. keep spreading reach herd immunity, require virtually everyone get vaccinated recovered infection. can't go route natural infection thing 1 2% lethality rate.

Meanwhile Miami look crazy wearing one gym  send church thought believed private companies could make decisions....which one it? felt like took actual bullet arm night of.

COVID-19 - ‚ÄúHold beer‚Äù less sprawl

I'm American maybe I'm wrong Texas sprawling cities world? Collapsing wave functions weak! America killed millions, went religious nut end. Lol sounds like cousins me. 74,000,000 kids U.S., 519 died COVID since crisis began (as July 28). works mortality rate 0.0007%, 0.015% amongst confirmed cases COVID.

Why difficult people apply right denominator? First pretty meaningless look entire population children, 74 *million*, compare died COVID. people earlier pandemic come virus ""less deadly flu"" comparing mortality rate entire country; infected population. 
 
 practically useless number especially much transmissible Delta variant apparent change behavior schools virtual last year ""sardines (probably without masks"". Key word profits That‚Äôs one unfortunate side effects this. freedom get vaccine get sick. next year every single person country going see hospital prices rise 20%. Hospitals going eat nursing cost every single person going pay long run. I'm glad Moderna then... man dead 30hrs second shot though    People playing politics children lives. hope future. one case. One! Case!. 

So stop fearmongering. 
Y'all care hundreds get blown africa act like world going one special case.
So calm keep observing. Fear mindkiller. 
When happens dozens hundreds times come back. Paying access regular GP cost money walk get vaccine hub. kinda different? UK high vaccination rate. value observing India. interested watching anyone suffer, either.  Greetings, fellow Deathling! well triage (choosing gets help) posters mentioned, also lowering standard care. Pre covid, icu bed might defined bed 1 dedicated nurse. 5 nurses, 5 'beds' available. run beds, stretch. 5 nurses equals 10 beds, 1 nurse caring 2 patients each. 5 nurses equals 25 beds, 1 nurse covering 5 patients, maybe less qualified help. Everyone still bed sort, care get massively decreased across board people die result Lol dived world history. Lol humans radical.  Doctors nurses make decisions, emergency care talking about, people going kicked vents admitted need it.   Oops chances virus mutate become contagious and/or deadly. That's Delta variant came be.

Also, people still getting symptoms/ missing work good economy huge portion population ill. Long-term effects also concern; even tiny fraction people face heart/lung issues road, mean higher healthcare costs societal burdens may even know yet. think frickin' hilarious whole time anti-vaxxers all, ""iT's RuShEd! TrUsT QuIcKlY DeVeLoPeD!"" they're like, ""ScReW ScIeNtIfIc PrOcEsS, aPpRoVe vAcCiNe **NOW**!"".  


\*sigh\* OMFG, people. Uh-huh. Sure.

How excess deaths, Putin?  guess really really weird way say ‚Äúgo ahead get OG vaccine, don‚Äôt wait new one‚Äù Early fifties vaccinated. parents got vaccinated kids got many diseases vaccines for: measles, mumps, hepatitis, chicken pox, whooping cough, Rubella stayed home 2 summers scared polio. virus teach everyone doesn‚Äôt pay attention lessons. UK sent news cameras ICUs showed people gasping breath others ventilators. also showed people working hospital mortuaries struggling deal volume dead. played nightly think he's also basing fact people vaccinated, super contagious vaccinated even spreading degree, we're completely open. 

We make unvaccinated immune, whether like not. Literally everybody get sick vaccinated. 

And people vaccinated young. 20 year olds obviously children. example, elderly 90% vaccinated. 

This going cause huge case rate, reduced hospitalizations deaths previously. 

But end wave, combination vaccinated people immune sick, reach herd immunity. nowhere virus go point, unless another variant pops up, still level protection, still producing vaccine global population. 

So ultimately lose wave status.  That‚Äôs going triangulation. Blame Biden, dumb law threw gas fire first place.  Indoor, poorly ventilated space people breathing heavily.

Sure masks crazy /s Nope. running president 2024. hate guy much amazing people willing risk lives others lives political identity. actual political beliefs mind you, impression others may them.
 
They **dare** risk looking like liberal. even help save lives. exactly.

I'm currently heavily pregnant decided vaccine nobody actually knows baby long term.

The recommendation take based risk getting severe covid. loved country lots covid high risk getting it, would likely take vaccine. I'm country risk catching covid quite low result I'm getting vaccine baby born. I‚Äôve heard ridiculous argument pop times now. roughly third population full idiot residents actively sabotaging attempts instead. teeth enforcement yet. Maybe change past experience seem indicate it. I've seen, expected 5-11 year olds get approval sometime late September 2-4 year olds sometime that. Come next year ballot box, Texans remember this? hope so, know won't. plain stupid. familiar idioms right? Yeah am. Get mental toughness pull big boy pants. Imagine everyone done said, we'd done considerably control. Yes! it! get vaccinated delivery, studies show pass antibodies baby they'll several months. That's super cool! republicans. multiple friends/family voted Biden (or didnt vote like trump) vaccinated. 

they either  
A) dont see point vaccine (dont think covid dangerous),  
B) skeptical coming fast. guess one benefit Canada getting jabbed whatever felt like giving us day. Mix match may pay long run :) lol? Idk, folks snuck across fake vaccine documents pretty irresponsible. Regardless Canadian American citizenship. 20k fines? gotten imo

Also food thought. Serious question: last time Abbott asked people, TV, get vaccinated? makes feel better, wife's doctor recommended take 20 weeks. there's evidence dangerous prior that, doctor suggested time baby's much developed lower chance natural miscarriage anyway admired Hutchinson (Arkansas) admitting wrong. takes lot humility that. he‚Äôd followed science wouldn‚Äôt boat.

Watching pair jokers (Abbott Desantis) double anti-mask makes angry sad. surprised. Austin area recorded highest [COVID-19 ICU entire pandemic yesterday.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll necessary protect people South Carolina,‚Äù McMaster said.

No, ‚ÄúAt point, it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs like last year.""

Correct. virulent harmful strain virus, vaccine safe freely available reduce severity impact people resources, state among bottom terms uptake. Masks proven reduce transmission, yet act. *You objectively stupider last ""We know handle virus.""

You do. simply choose ""It‚Äôs completely different situation.‚Äù

Yes, is. nothing hide behind. first timer ignorance. willfully negligent. held responsible civilly. Agreed.
And numbers telling us vaccine (despite Redditors believe) enough stop spread covid. 
But know, let's keep thinking vaccine 100% solution even though Pfizer/moderna studies show currently isn't. Thank you. appreciate reply. Hopefully good Christmas least. wear cloth mask N95. theory since reuse N95s know elastic wear time, holds securely face. (It also, opinion, looks ton better, fashion primary concern.) I'm Houston - last check, 80% zip code (total population) least partially vaccinated. medical profession, put price tag dealing stupid bullshit - high one. also question goal shutdown is. soon open back up, go back spreading. storm right building later? Yeah come Canada 2 bedroom house large city costs 1 million dollars, expensive telecom services, pay 3 years worth car insurance 1.

Canada litteraly everything expensive. guess cold high cost living keeps riff raff out.   Australia can't even get sufficient amount Moderna Pfizer yet. someone SE Asia get access? Thank you! shitshow name new variant Houston variant? Jeez can‚Äôt imagine would get downvoted. It‚Äôs common sense. people interpreting like overly caustic cynical? safety concerns entire parts country right now, that‚Äôs fact.  don‚Äôt know people think shutdown gonna happen event numbers going up.

Until people die streets, days over. one gonna risk killing political career ANOTHER shutdown. got suck up. informative reassuring, thank much! imagine lot people, especially Americans, reading headline pointing fingers yelling ""SEE?"" US. NYC NJ restrictions. varies state state. Unvaxxed states getting slammed 5 vaccinated states (14M people) had

580 people hospital, 12 deaths

In 5 least vaccinated states (16M people)?

6,600 hospitalized, 104 deaths

Per capita , least vaccinated states 

10X hospitalizations 7X deaths

So yeah, vaccines working  technicians control systems (Fanuc, Siemens, etc). billing rate absolutely ridiculous bet tech get paid nearly much price seems indicate. Give two weeks. wild. Source? No, change that. process separate BLA approval vaccine. 

Based seen, Pfizer reporting data either 2+ 5+ Sept. EUA approval age range shortly that. That's good. Maybe common sense end prevailing. doubt returning back school year even feels better. taught Kindergarten First Grade, think homeschool us vaccine comes out...even though already it, really feel like worrying getting re-infected anything. never have. basically Delta. Like, extremely close Delta. Why? Among age group 60+, 90% vaccinated. make significant portion severe illnesses. if, instance, 60% severe illnesses vaxxed concerned about. still mean unvaxxed much likely severely ill.

With example:
10 people, 9 vaxxed, 1 isn't.
Out them: 3 severely ill, 2 vaxxed, 1 isn't.
Meaning vaxxed, 35% likely severely ill, unvaxxed 100%.

So statement mean nothing without adjustment representation ratios general population think *Texas* messed Texas.

What twist!  evidence think also much better place terms vulnerable people Covid. USA like 65s vaccinated, hospitalizations deaths occurring. think alone help keep death rate even cases go up. really go many places general tbh, always wears N95 mask too. Hopefully boosters coming soon, yeah. Yes, Thank you, made my.point. situstionnwe.are.because guys coming millions going home to.iowa complaining. think bringing shit here? think pictures congregated beach summer break? floridians, dont want friends tourists want money.... doesnt, stay whatever shitty state youre from. dont give shit youre there.

Their decisions resulted largest lost life modern history. leadership  Today grandmother finally got vaccinated. 

She lives anti-vax family primary care givers. Since 90, insisted get vaccine ‚Äúit‚Äôs safe old people‚Äù ‚Äúthe side effects could kill her.‚Äù (I know, know.)

Finally siblings enough. anti-vax family go away week long vacation, decided going bring mom get vaccine gone.

Apparently, however, also decided morally wrong tell anti-vax sibling mom getting shot. yesterday one siblings talked anti-vaxers told happening, even going happen town, might well get even leave she‚Äôll fully protected get back. 

I don‚Äôt know conversation went, know morning got J&amp;J dose. haven‚Äôt seen grandmother since 2019, avoiding going even though fully vaccinated don‚Äôt want vector disease. schedule trip home see mom two weeks worry it!  Gottlieb says fourth wave, month fourth wave starts :  guess might‚Äôve? never tested positive symptoms‚Ä¶ got tested like 4 times March shot.

The israeli data consistent UK's data. disease much likely hospitalize elderly, elderly likely vaccinated.

I‚Äôve confused 4 year old home I‚Äôm leaning towards getting sake sake point. agree. think lot countries went rationale less effective vaccine better vaccine global vaccine supply shortage. Can't say blame countries. respect choice, please consider wearing masks indoors. Even fully vaccinated, still don‚Äôt understand long-term implications breakthrough cases.

I don‚Äôt wanna add anything mix. fortunately avoided COVID -so far- reassess stance get studies this.

All said, thank getting vaccinated! ‚ò∫Ô∏è fda approves Moderna / pfizer. kids 12 able get vaccinated? heard that's case wanted sure. 3 year old 18 month old. there's evidence lambda worse delta.

It's like I'm waiting something happen get life back 'forward movement' (so speak) there's indication yet moment come.  


I'm lucky I'm Canada least I've able live safely, far. (Vaccinated, us soon able, safe still mask outside near strangers/inside strangers.) 100%. part. Wore mask mandate got lifted got vaccine soon available age group. worn mask since May dr appt. still keep one car, wear one place going requires one around is. seen signs groceries asking wear mask unvaccinated. Went 2 large crowd events past weekend first time since early 2020. drives insane. Especially [six days denying extra help hospitals.  idea - people already rushing get third dose even though hasn‚Äôt recommended yet west. think idea boosters even though current vaccines still work really well, stay ahead curve Incase? Well, yeah, probably go interview people. something like article:

""Scoop: Inside crowded border patrol tent Donna, Border Patrol Union claiming happening. Now, they're law enforcement union, take mountain salt they're saying, claim ""Not everyone encounter test, exhibit type symptoms everybody symptoms it,"" Chris Cabrera, vice president National Border Patrol Council, said Saturday ""Fox News Live."" ""And we‚Äôre releasing people door day day actual positive tests COVID keep popping up,"" said.

That's claim table. going say fact checking that, can't cite statement government official. That's fact checking, that's lazy online journalism.

I'm saying easy, could maybe contact migrant advocate organizations ask think Covid-positive migrants treated. way get third perspective besides border patrol union government official. Congrats, Governor Abbott! yet mRNA. Coming soon immuno older people. 

Some places started giving mRNA booster J&amp;J - San Francisco US example.

Media terrible job reporting effective mRNA vaccinations people want boosters thinking need recently ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know risk baby‚Äù language acog regarding vaccine. Typical disclaimer bullshit, pregnant working hard avoid anything could hurt baby, don‚Äôt envy pregnant woman feels like she‚Äôs losing either way/had false sense control regarding covid. Thankfully recently updated language include disclaimer, hope encourages pregnant women get vaccine. say sympathy group unvaccinated people. Plenty smart teenagers vaccinated without amtivax parents concent though. 

The rest pandering paranoid Qannons Well, nobody's vaccinating unconscious people though. hospitals generally places keeping vaccines since vaccination centers someone unconscious due Covid, there's way they'd vaccinate even wanted... Now, someone unconscious vaccination center, they'd either middle getting vaccinated, it'd kind done deal would imply consented they'd anywhere else they'd brought hospital without vaccinated. 

Like afraid vaccinated unconscious issue happens... yes exchange resignation. think might irresponsible label COVID psychosis, could coincidence - irresponsible say COVID psychosis absolutely case-specific knowledge regarding kid? confusing six days ago denying hospital ls extra workers.  AZ, we're getting swamped too. watching Facebook antivaxxer know.

Before got COVID-19 constantly posting covid shit mild, hoax, take vitamins *(lets see works you, bud)*

Then finally got it. Ends uo hospital oxygen. he's there, he's still posting, complaining hospital medication make feel better right away (it's *novel* virus, dinkus). 

Of course, wife gets goes oxygen too. Next comes gofundme wellwishers. 

They managed pull through, surprisingly enough. Neither especially healthy individuals.

This serious situation. Hopefully inject humor that. endemic Coronaviruses takes 8-17 years complete antigenic drift. point antibodies produced earlier infection longer reactive. 

Given, SARS-Cov-2 circulating ‚Äúcommon-cold‚Äù Coronaviruses, would expect antigenic drift occur little quicker, still years. drift doesn‚Äôt occur one mutation, it‚Äôs across multiple mutations. Vaccine efficacy natural immunity won‚Äôt fall cliff single mutation.

It‚Äôs exhausting worrisome. DeSantis like, ""If die, die"" RE, MFM, Ob-GYN strongly recommend get vaccine soon possible, back April. truth regardless whatever anti-factsers claimed. go ask immunologists without agenda. far I‚Äôm concerned, unvaccinated choice, don‚Äôt blame situation anyone else‚Äôs. Yeah, DeSantis dumbass, could prevent situation yourself.

I concerned kids 12 immune-compromised people can‚Äôt take vaccine. Everyone else choice preferred go hell. Stop blaming government clearly take control situation yourself. know people typically read headlines address question directly link, may agree assessment answered:

So say ""both spread"", ignoring conditions one case (vaxed covid nose infection) less likely spread extended period, case potentially higher viral load (unvax, symptomatic infection sneeze), entirely productive. clear here, even scenario, vaccinated better option. 

All missing quantitative analysis couse (there's lot data honestly), again, ignores actually calculating risk, vs saying ""this could happen"". Lots things happen, make decisions what's likely happen. nurse union facilities make icu nurses typically 2:1 ratio go 4:1 higher patient nurse ratio. answer question - don‚Äôt.

The British government ordered hundreds millions vaccines sure ones would work ones wouldn't. Ordering many doses possible many companies possible sensible decision 2020.

Now supply started outstrip demand, British government already started donating doses using. near-certainty majority ""hoarded"" doses get donated poorer countries. send masks? follow apples apples IgG Ig G. antibodies made matter got there. mRNA long gone, within day two vaccination. treating mild medium severity.

""But cost one concerns surrounding monoclonal antibodies. safety issues consider, monitored closely PROVENT trial clinical trials. 
One troubling phenomenon called **antibody-dependent enhancement**, observed scientists trying create vaccines dengue fever. Receptors tail region antibodies normally bind immune cells, allowing antibodies activate immune system. cases, though, seems receptors accidentally attach viruses too, allowing pathogens access cells rather stopping them. Monoclonal antibody manufacturers taking steps minimize likelihood, engineering receptors mutations limit risk virus binding. 
Another major issue whether monoclonal antibodies could **quickly become obsolete new variants SARS-CoV-2 emerge**, something already proving challenge. Recent studies conducted U.S., South Africa, China suggest Eli Lilly GSK‚Äôs products, consist single monoclonal antibody, may work one three major variants SARS-CoV-2. papers released bioRxiv preprint server yet peer reviewed."" much shorter gap doses virus consent. Agreed, also accept people largely arguing doubt anxiety here. No! course breakthrough infections super rare! work (do I?) No! 

The thing is, really need worry much. modify behavior bit case spread high community.

The news keeps talking whiplash, slightest bit pattern recognition read couple like graphs, expecting much different happening. like ocean perpetually surprised bobbing Tyson foods got major uptake mandating it. conviction resign principles paycheck Quick question - idea long ultimately took status changed ""Testing Started""? Mine switched early morning. Thanks!  link messed up: Yes know vaccines help body fight virus prevent entirely.People vaccinated less chances spreading also make symptoms milder give chances surviving it.

For example: criminal unknown police,they harder time finding suspect know criminal lives,it easier arrest recently read father Sandy Hook survivor literally accused child crisis actor. It‚Äôs days 8 bed headline  FrEeDuM Pregnant people weren‚Äôt intentionally included trials, became pregnant mid-trial. Granted, it‚Äôs whole lot usable data, since babies born ok antibodies, doc said wait 2nd trimester get shots, that‚Äôs did. far good! Baby bean due November, peak sick season. 

Unfortunately, don‚Äôt think going whole lot ways knowingly ethically include pregnant folks medical trials, hopefully it‚Äôll get better ‚Äúwhoops, trial patients happened get pregnant!‚Äù Yeah, snows gets cold, go skiing, play hockey, snowmobile, ice fish, snowball wars.

Having four diverse seasons awesome! led rise anti intellectualism country? say shut wind turbines cause rapid airborne transmission Delta variant. average number children redditor 0, idea kind choices we've forced make last 18 months. Again, I‚Äôm empathetic situation. ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know long term effects‚Äù mythos. Sure, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù that‚Äôs vaccines work given everything know vaccines work particular vaccines made, don‚Äôt really pose risk pregnant people.

Yes, needs considered maybe even prioritized. save lives places prevent another variant emerging taking hold. Fuck that. Dude needs resign surrender power feds. he'll fucking take credit minute dig hole. always begin masked runs okay. 

But try push end record good time, begin trying draw air can, that's mask becomes cloying horrible. thing happened Moderna June. Yes study-- done Israel looking SARS-CoV-2 antibodies cord blood. Levels highest newborns mothers second dose 30 weeks pregnancy. sound like I‚Äôm wishing bad fortune someone yes hope hospital mandates becomes jobless. forgetting option C: thoughts prayers. everyone get vaccine - protects people can't get one. surprised actually, school board pretty level-headed Georgia. Unless vaccine efficacy asymptomatic infection dropped 53% less bet would wrong.  53% effectiveness expect 100 infections among fully vaccinated every 100 infections among unvaccinated.

Studies seem showing around 64% effectiveness infection.

With 64% effectiveness expect 74 infections among fully vaccinated every 100 infections among unvaccinated.

For Vermont formula follows:

  VE=Vaccine Effectiveness
  Iv=# Infections among vaccinated
  Iuv=# Infections among unvaccinated
  Pv=%population Vaccinated = 68%
  Pu=%population Unvaccinated = 32%
  
  = (1-(Iv/Iu)*(Pu/Pv))*100
  = (1-Iv/Iuv*(32/68))*100

You claiming Iv/Iuv 1 higher (AKA vaccinated people infections).

  = (1-32/68)*100
    = (1-1*32/68)*100
    = 53%

So unless vaccine effectiveness 53 less still higher cases among Interesting idea! prolly right they're going bother. I'd it. evidence lamba mutations help virus evade vaccines. even infectious, could outperform delta highly vaccinated areas.
 would hope least large enough portion non-vaxxed holding full FDA approval. see reasoning apprehensive wanting wait data (not plenty already). I'll even admit, slight apprehension got mine, taking immunosuppressants seen much way efficacy, side effects, etc. people similar boats. still got soon could believed benefit would seriously outweigh potential costs. 

For people, continued employment contingency hopefully enough get get vaccinated. They'll whatever side effects get, see they're ultimately fine could potentially convince others get doses.

For others still refuse, wonder cost/benefit analysis would be. one hand, likely quit terminated, making wards shorter staffed. other, that's risk contagion eliminated patients staff. know way advantageous, one side necessarily ""better"" other. Regardless, going nightmare around like first massive spike. time, biggest shame could prevented. Aubrey Huff MTG week people can‚Äôt get easy access covid test, numbers go /s 

But seriously- riding cases, testing centers opening again. lines testing crazy long cali Mother Teresa model. Lots praying comfort sick, keep away hospitals.  Happy you. CDC vs FL DOH difference numbers fuckin huge.

For Sat/Sun/Monday:

CDC says 80,538 cases.

FLDOH says 56,386

This massive difference. previous week 3 day span 55,679.

So either FL 44.6% increase cases time frame (aka continued massive growth) 1.2% increase (aka possible peak actual decrease Sunday).


FL gives every reason believe numbers actually think im leaning towards this. (its like numbers good, lies 55k cases day). also odd CDC got numbers Monday update normally Tuesday get sun/mon/tues (based last 2 weeks).

Guess we'll see CDC updates numbers today stick simple really. much ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù crowd. honestly even worth discussing. debunking articles anything except teaching (very stupid) controversy. postponed getting vaccinated first trimester, got Pfizer shots that. Yes, IgA SARS-CoV-2 like IgA. IgG SARS-CoV-2 like IgG. new virus mean reinvent wheel prove antibodies work IgG transported across placenta IgA secreted breast milk. No, it‚Äôs not. Article says so.   Somehow exactly predicted shitshow became politicized. still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll wild Jan bloodbath getting 4K deaths day. 2k per day see that.    I‚Äôve enjoyed homeschooling kids recognize importance peer interaction/socialization. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm fence homeschooling year. far religious exemptions go, totally agree. Someone elsewhere thread brought fact post r/Catholicism way discredit me. However Catholic Church pro-vaccine published multiple documents fact. Catholics (myself included) believe covid vaccines morally permissible gotten healthy, eligible individuals means serving common good. Everyone family eligible vaccinated. truly understand ""I want guinea pig"" bullshit. billion people vaccinated COVID. think we're well past testing phase. not. there's major reason need constantly reiterate ""I'm racist, but..."" akin someone instinctively needs add ""believe me"" every fucking statement make. 

Sure guarantee subconsciously mean opposite; looks like duck, quacks like duck, probably racist liar. Also duck. Reminds 2020 Proof what? ""being same""; applying flawed risk evaluation.
 
For odd reason, people think worth risking one's child transport vehicle, even though roughly twice many kids die car accidents covid-19!
 
The reality kids dying car accidents enough dissuade people driving kids. one really cared kid surviving car accident, reduce fatality rate never driving highway? drive beyond 30mph?
 
To put different way, would let kid outside house 14, minuscule possibility getting kidnapped stranger? say ridiculous, public willing send gov't employees investigate parents allowing seven year olds take bus without accompanying them!
 
I anti-masker. think reasonable precaution require kids wear mask attending school. also think reasonable significantly reduce number kids classroom, even though could double cost providing public education. without people properly grasping risk factor (i.e. - science tells us)

The reality extremely unlikely child 12 die contracting covid-19 (even delta). unlikely, arguable still important child 12 attend public school, even maskless. dumb public policy prevent kids 12 going school maskless, almost guaranteed contract covid attending school (pre-covid policies), spread family members community.

Stop going 1/6/21 fear kid 12 contracting covid dying. happens, twice likely kid die riding vehicle, even take reasonable precautions avoid that!  Godspeed. gf teacher I‚Äôm livid Texas right now. least many districts telling Abbot choke eating fines. youre fat shaming!? Wow woke  Yes except Democratic Karens wanted safely masks social distancing, etc. 

This year republican Karens want bury head sand open schools like aren‚Äôt cusp largest wave pandemic far. Gosh, sucks. it‚Äôs big planet. Guess bound happen somebody.

Glad it‚Äôs severe! least you‚Äôll many antibodies won‚Äôt know all.

I hope feel better soon. question regarding variants;

Why seem much concern Covid related variants opposed Flu related variants? inherent difference virus make likely turn dangerous, something like incubation period? Seems don‚Äôt get Flu vaccines there‚Äôs global concern it.

I assume there‚Äôs reasoning here, don‚Äôt know :) BAG ON! APPLY DIRECTLY FOREHEAD! ones yelling need anyone else insisting they're best they're local governance?

I hope people children get help need. mean, it‚Äôs pandemic. Even masked schools seeing cases. won‚Äôt see end cases long long time ever. Covid endemic, it‚Äôs time reassess want live society going forward. Exactly Sunday Saturday. count Monday‚Äôs positive test rate‚Ä¶  like Nate lot think he's good analyzing polls creating useful statistical models. interested takes COVID first, really going way stay lane anymore. He's essentially arguing scientists epidemiologists Twitter point. said true? got AZ followed Moderna mix. Rheumatoid Arthritis. hope boosters offered. I‚Äôd love get another Moderna shot, right studies suggested people Immune Modulating drugs shown lower immune response vaccines. Florida institutes mask mandate follows CDC guidelines vigorously promotes vaccination. I‚Äôve said it, I‚Äôll say again, looks like Marylin Manson makeup.  Oh, wants help? S.O.B. resign he's done state. let someone ethics brain cells manage now. realize simple that. Reduced transmission prior delta great

Reduced transmission even delta also great. vaccinated people breakthrough infections transmit, vaccines still good preventing these, well. top that, vaccinated people clear virus faster, also reducing transmission. yet another study improvement immune response vaccination previously infected understand someone could logically ignore science, medicine, research embrace homeopathy. logical argument. 

It's ego driven narcissistic view world. Whatever want believe choose see better anything counter ""evil"". tomcat already dirty. could use good bath too. Anyone still unvaxxed (with exceptions couldn't) get care. send home hope best like chose to. They're taking space jeopardizing people got sick fault own.

No, inhumae. humane we're helping save room protect lives people jeopardize rest society. 100s ICU beds still empty. know anyone's panicking.

/S Two words ""exponential growth"" sure case Delta though? know that's we've living swearing last year instead cleaning groceries lol Delta seems transmissible general wonder [study looked data 2005-2007 covering 97 three years studied, total ICU occupancy ranged 57.4% 82.1%... change occupancy across years increase occupancy influenza seasons. FLVS Flex awesome. Seriously. Pfizer. First dose gave Migraine Hell. miserable day half. Second dose, felt little flu-ish weather. slept lot. NBD. sure comparing 6 month efficacy numbers delta current numbers delta. Yes, different variants. report 6 month numbers delta.  ...people absolutely need scared high numbers. need understand situation delta, needs behavior change. understanding Hutchinson never wanted sign passed veto proof majority wouldn‚Äôt helped. said, signing it, could made stronger statement beginning probably regrets that.  Good thing aren‚Äôt charge reason every Chinese resident already vaccinated vaccine supply. enough, they'll require everyone get suffer official consequences. calculation includes whole population seems clear Rs seem think COVID really isn‚Äôt big deal tactics angle votes going get voters killed. Talk cutting nose spite face. feel like go gym taking self responsibility risk. I‚Äôd rather wear mask gym want go ahead. think confirmed space breathing won‚Äôt matter either way. get vaccinated move want stop death, bad news you...

I live Ontario. restricted. still restrictions! Everyone mad it. much. cases currently low hospitalizations even lower. highly vaccinated still masks indoors. Kids going school September better circumstances states opened quickly. virus suck. hope kids everywhere safe things go better think going too.

 Perhaps that's see results glorious lockdowns first-hand?  governor won‚Äôt allow counties mandate masks

Will allow state funding organizations require Covid vaccines (including hospitals)

Did provide funding virtual learning

While pretend speak freedom pro-birth, backward luddites responsible many deaths always said covid impacted dicks aesthetically   acolytes trump, Abbott DeSantis never offer step friend sent me. anyone send articles/documents incorrect? students. read CDC includes pneumonia organ failure ‚Äúmild‚Äù cases. every child vaccinated today mRNA vaccines, would put full immunity earlier September 21st.

October going shitshow. Drs already immunising Australia 2 X Pfizer vaccines followed 2 X Astrazenica.  15 days slow spread  need help. 
I deal Covidiots daily basis, common one arguments ""we would need vaccinate at-risk groups old people solve problem able lift every single restriction since everyone else covid almost always progresses like mild moderate flu"" I'm sure that's bullshit probably is. Anyone, please? See actually feel bad antivaxxers. don‚Äôt know flip understand need get page. Maybe letting see vaccine developed start finish? Showing direct long term human response vaccine? Education key can‚Äôt force people want learn. talk them. think many friends doctors much aware bad outcomes Covid include dying. Many millions already struggling long Covid people get infected, certain percentage ongoing medical &amp; mental problems knows long.

Because it‚Äôs attacking younger people now, likely survive even extensive hospitalization, quality life 40 year old spending 2 months vent? don‚Äôt know answers things think about‚Ä¶ I'm assuming flying LAX SFO? We're great L.A. County, hopefully September we'll better shape - said, schools starts August 16th could also flying crisis. LAUSD requiring masks weekly testing students staff probably bad locales, could go either way. careful airports can. Best luck!!  Yeah, unvaccinated people exist. Unless federal order making people get vaccinated cut essential services (like grocery), need build policies knowledge.

Mask mandates lifted bit early Delta first started popping up. said vaccinated people wear them, even knew anti-maskers gonna stop wearing them. know even vaccinated spread bad get it. 

Other nations even need vaccine get control.   conservatives know, boris trump doesnt really make whole lot difference politics inherently reggressive, populist clinging status quo never exxisted first place saying GA TX dealing wackos well complete lack safety protocols part, parents wary. listened gut sent back. parents fence similar state situations, reading us may make situation worried og minds weeks. 

You said dont try scare people safer states, say dont act like states safe clearly arent. consider lucky live state easier make safe choices in. us place afford move one moment. Smallpox didn‚Äôt asymptomatic transmission period. work hospital DFW. wonder considers things like hospital opened closed unit made ICU. account that, ""negative"" ICU beds hospital. Really?

Pretty shitty narrow-minded attitude. say knowing baby brother diagnosed months ago cancer currently going thru pretty extreme chemo. can‚Äôt get damn vax right now. hope, god forbid, gets Covid (and everything else avoid it) someone like isn‚Äôt triage panel. Also frustrating lack clarity masks personal defensive measure protect others yourself. fact person responding isn‚Äôt quite correct. lab evidence improves immuno response little real world evidence (more antibodies don‚Äôt necessarily mean stronger protection). Immunocompromised people shown limited response right bat, waned.

The main hesitation doses could go vaccinating everyone world rather giving third doses may provide limited relief. US getting third dose everyone Egypt remains unvaccinated, unvaccinated country could one produce variant escapes vaccine significantly  boys still young, 7yo going back just... he's tough! üòÇ

Still moving, lot fewer people alive beginning. No, hospitalizations deaths countries (Seychelles, Chile, Brazilian town gave adults Sinovac experiment) rise along increase cases. decoupling cases vs . hospitalizations/death, much like happened Israel UK.

Basically, Sinovac performed like mRNAs performing US (i.e. substantially reduced efficacy infections, effective hospitalizations deaths). football season school horizon. Mark Kline, chief Children‚Äôs Hospital New Orleans, told local news outpatient Covid positivity rates risen 1% month ago 20%. hospital treating 18 child Covid inpatients six intensive care. three ventilators, including three month old baby, Kline told WDSU News.

Even every child got mRNA shots today, fully vaccinated September 21st. Every day counts. fraud fraud illegal? Fucking charge done it. read article, doesn‚Äôt support statement made post replied to.

It‚Äôs new concept, way whatsoever research suggest vaccines lead better viruses. replication errors (evolution). Vaccination actually SLOWS process though, greatly reducing number hosts replication continue taking place. Fewer hosts less replication new variants arise less less frequently. cut people life now. stay contact rotten human beings? Yeah. get 40 scale even work amounts low.

Driving biggest concern kids objectively single largest risk face lives. spend TON money buying new cars regularly best follow IIHS, NHTSA, regulatory data that.

Dude, think people places like India can't vaccinate scared shitless? think random dude Bangalore fighting measures? They're masking. distance country people WFH Amazon food delivery available? Masks much.

Even places people followed mandates really closely can't stop spread entirely. Look ROK (South Korea) great example. They're probably 2nd best world among democracies they're still dealing it. 

Again, I'm saying mask. wear masks indoors right now. exercise due caution masks, testing, epidemiologically-proven measures. world cannot simply stand still either. fair, let expire millions vaccines. shipped 100 million vaccines.

You said ""most people choices listen MSM social media"" later say ""don't time"" verify statements claims. takes minutes fact check article statement. takes less time verify OANN, Fox, Newsmax, MSNBC, example, highly biased sources. takes less time understand FW: FW: FW: FW: FW: FW: FW: FW: FW: FW: email got crazy uncle source information Facebook post made yoga instructor also sells essential oils good source truth. takes maybe 10-15 minutes week catch what's going virus ESPECIALLY young, unvaccinated kids.

This endemic. Get vaccinated, understand life risks trust vaccine get sick. Lockdowns work would nothing. contagious. Get vaccinated live it.  Republican said repeatedly Texans information intelligence make decisions steps take protect health health around them.

Survey says, that‚Äôs lie. Paint eagle side 2 AR 15s blonde bikini. treated like indoors groop leisure/hobby activity. meant Iranian people seemed genuinely want progress shit government knew Bill Gates trusted! 
Some folks wear cloth mask surgical mask help close side gaps surgical mask. Back N95s could found ones exhaust ports, folks would wear another mask top cover unfiltered port. Otherwise, additional masks benefit wearing N95. 

I think idea wearing surgical cloth masks protect works pretty well enough people it, know count level compliance anymore. think worth effort find good fitting N95. seen anyone tarred feathered. opposite, given platforms allowed host anti vax rallies. claiming they're persecuted. bizarre world. guy video total ass. He's got mask purpose pretending exercise, telling officer ok one near by. officer gives first warning, guy goes ""I'll go back moment"" snarky way. officer yells ""second warning"" guy goes ""2 minutes!"" Later fakes going wrong floor well troll officer.

It's clear whether guy infected contact positive case (and thus enforced quarantine) whole area lockdown.

The local authorities supposed deliver food people.  Well, even one authors israel study said calculated data wrong vaccine efficacy higher calculated. check sources posting. since ""WHO's OK"" made legitimacy since whole fiasco started?

WHO knew decade ago anymore. medical science based entity anymore, purely political. big issue booster 2.0 version vaccine tailored Delta + variants. feel like rushing mix-and-match current crop vaccines exactly prudent. I'm saying bad idea per se, wait months shot that's targeting specific spike proteins variants, seems like might well that. 2nd shot Moderna (back May), able leave bed 5 days.....I tried going work 5 days feeling hot chills time got sent home (stayed home 2 days). side effects hit like truck, body aches unbelievable little appetite. feel great I'm willing take booster shot means avoid hospital machine helping breathe. I'm still masking public places, mostly immune system bad I'm usually type catch cold summer. YES SUMMER. D: gotten cold far wearing mask saved me. That's part, schools need thing, politicians (e.g.Desantis) getting way political points.  syphilis shit dictionary. case wanted find it. also think following spanish flu, hasnt multi waves. two waves - first one, old people adults burn out, second wave got kids young adults sick -- burned -- lot people died burn happened.

all 'waves' marketing / news cycle talk makes harder grasp think similiar pattern spanish flu. 

That said, covid? anything could happen. think might stay like influenza, low level/seasonal us ever hiding, mutating every year - less deadly, host defense - always hosted humans mammals around world sad. soon former coworkers (2 6) wear mask vaccinate. I'm out. [There's xkcd currently recovering covid. Pfizer shots months ago. symptoms terrible fever, cough, muscle aches, chills, fatigue. Fever hit low 100s. isolated since symptoms symptoms lasted couple days. feel 98% now, still test positive, continuing isolate.  

Eta: also sore throat Texas ambassador Cancun introducing bills senate?  history.  Yeah, horrible stat, capture relative risk. Trumpians know like that. Damn. hope we'll start recommending vaccine (germany). See 'fantasy myth'. I'm vaccinated work office unvaxxed ppl masking. wear mask avoid close contact them. wash hands times throughout day. right I'm pushing understand new norm live it. best protect trust ability vax decrease symptoms experience catch it. I'm old, I'm fat, I'm done fear. positive value me. know we'll catch point. Moderna piece cake. Took nap day one (anxiety overload lack sleep appointment, exhausted afterwards) second shot‚Ä¶ first 24 hours fine, developed annoying headache lasted day half approx (like one allergy headaches). 72 hour mark post shot happy clam totally normal. Yes, ""long COVID"" virtually meaningless currently documented - ""Most breakthrough cases mild asymptomatic, although 19% persistent symptoms weeks).""

When people think long COVID, probably arn't thinking person cough lingers seven weeks, person would included 19%.  flu years back, feel 100% 2-3 months. 2 years later, 100% recovered.  big difference lingering, mild symptoms months, fatigue loss taste/smell lingers years. They6 Boomers older.  thing. virus level data based number cycles required detect virus PCR tests, significant source bias.

The big problem PCR count dead viral particles active virus. great test determine one *infected* valid test see one *infectious*. This. People think virus going ""just disappear"" one day lack historical perspective. variants duration. 
Continual yearly vaccination severe illness/death options, unless science develops new method combat type virus. GA husband fully vaxxed, work home, grocery pickup. better judgement, six year started first grade last week. wore mask, many class didnt, covid....after five days school....she feeling bad, two starting feel bad, feel fine cant smell well. smell really strong essential oils mildly get close bottle, cant smell cooking toddlers dirty diapers all...so anyone fence school, vote yo homeschool awhile.  It‚Äôs don‚Äôt care unvaccinated, pales comparison much care people endangering. sincerely don‚Äôt want anyone die, want get vaccinated rest world quit holding breath. 

But burnout real themselves. Yesterday wifes coworker induced early followed ventilator use. Florida USA Part wants say bad, made bed electing Abbott.

Then realize, OK. Abbott admitting defeat lack competently, outside help step in, others created mess step down. Wouldn‚Äôt resort measures people gotten shot earlier on. SO's cousin works hospital &amp; entire nursing staff claimed feel days after. However, got Moderna &amp; felt worse flu shot. Exactly. Hospitalizations california going (around 1200 people hospitalized lowest point June, 6000+ now, rising). seems inevitable people die well. Nurses wanted? imagine America nurses would interested comes true, I'm happy it, especially considering complete lack able plan life past months. want guarantee vaccinated person, fear restrictions anymore. I'm happy wear mask public transport end winter to.

What I'm missing suggestion, though, clear end point. could say remaining restrictions lifted soon 70% population fully vaccinated, health system overwhelmed anymore immunity rate. NZ good white rich. okay. presented facts scientist make conclusion viral load using nasal swabs PCRs, PCR measures viral RNA come from... dead viral particles, active virus.

But kind non-factual vaxxed swabs affected factors viral load way grossly underestimate viral load respiratory systems vaxxed.

Then there's point continue discussion! Yeah almost felt bit relieved side-effects kicked morning got second shot Moderna, feel anything first day, sore arm first shot. tried avoid taking Paracetamol fever headache long possible (to get strongest immune response), 10 hours gave took 2x500 mg. side-effects already began subside however. much worse bad hangover, again, tend suffer hangovers hell I've drinking. wear outside? Wtf? hes least texan person ever seen... yet... Uncle bragged Pfizer Moderns like 4 hours. Im sure he‚Äôll say crock shit.  You‚Äôre fine. Losing weight exercise best thing protect COVID point. It‚Äôs already hard replicate. Unique QR code first last name. happen healthcare workers throwing away injections giving people QR code Compared vaccination, still significant improvement. vaccine working well former strains near unheard IMO people acting like Covid worry kids. However kids wearing masks distancing whole pandemic helped keep numbers low. public none parents got vaccine think kids ""if get even notice"". think great example statistic misleading. Claiming 99.99% fully vaccinated people severe breakthrough claiming significant portion hospitalized people fully vaccinated true, measure different things. 99.99% statistic trying inflate effectiveness vaccines hospitalization figure shown demonstrate actual effectiveness adjusting proportion vaccinated population.

In case UK, 90%+ people aged 50+ fully vaccinated, 45% hospitalizations among fully vaccinated, massive point support vaccination. Covid? Everyone know rough first shot Covid getting vaccinated. badly Bhutan, health education free 8% national poverty line. horrifying. 

I'm mad antimask antivaccine idiots making horrible pandemic even worse prolonging time suffer. Trumpians know say facemasks cause Covid. tell surgery get doctor medical team wear masks gloves, they're like, ""well that's crazy though"". SMH. people exactly brightest bulbs box!

It's probably large amount air exhaled inhaled via mouth, without filtering effect nasal route, virus directly hitting lung.

Reasonable thing protecting respiratory system others using proper masks (or methods any), regardless vaccination status.


Unfortunately, vaccination give level protection obtain form good masks (at least N95 equivalent) used properly. Delta. Oh might cede authority feds throw temper tantrum federal government took over. See? Obviously government overreach. would surprised prediction comes true. makes amazing much covid there.

The numbers Texas Florida rising vaccine even exist. True, african Americans hesitations different reasons. crazy bad history Tuskegee situations.

Something completely different?

Herd immunity is: resistance spread infectious disease within population based pre-existing immunity high proportion individuals result previous infection vaccination.

New Zealand R 0. Doesnt mean herd immunity. Agreed. siblings vegan everyone took it. Plus one worked clinical trials.  might missed it, say anything severe disease/death? Pfizer still effective that?

It‚Äôs 64% fully vaccinated according world data hope say no. Popeyes fried chicken places delivery  Yea... that's fair. also hate heat, would fun (but kids wanting go Disney land might Trump that). way measure ethical irresponsibility?

And way measure whether symptomatic person *hasn't tested* contagious? We've already informed vaccinated, infected people spread virus *at viral load* unvaxxed. also found **no significant difference** viral load present breakthrough infections occurring fully vaccinated people cases, suggesting viral load vaccinated unvaccinated persons infected coronavirus similar.

So yes, indeed ""measure"" ethical responsibility/irresponsibility *anyone* chooses go public symptomatic untested. yet advocate lockdown would disproportionally effected them. Remember weeks ago Israel's health ministry showed Pfizer 40% effective preventing infection (and lot people thought wrong)? Pepperidge Farms remembers.

Remember Pfizer made case July booster shots, US health authorities said needed yet? Pepperidge Farms remembers.

When looking proportion fully vaccinated people test positive, ranges 2.2% unvaccinated Connecticut, 5.9% fully vaccinated Arkansas. However, keep mind numbers clouded base rate fallacy.

You reap sow. Lucky you, took week. Still, way better getting Covid :)

I jsut hope booster shots every year spent week bed :( hearing past year half.

It's mathematical epidemiological fact, proven many times practice. Vietnam prime example, many community close 100%, indoors (through roughly March) outdoors. yet COVID kept marching anyway

So need ask, leak. Kids school masks? Bars still open? Spring break? hard figure retrospect. Look curve turned sharply correlate happened then. Start new school term perhaps? Yes really paid attention one shot vs two since J&amp;J approved. first shot big money anyway *While* they're busy saving neighbors personally put risk. Delta recently became predominant strain. older studies would data primarily original strain, variants, little bit delta. efficacy studies older couple months mean much anymore.  I'm sure people wanted smallpox eradicated immediately, too, technical means exist. do. 

What's point? unfortunately, happen Vancouver. 

I agree federal government drop ball, lot unhappy people that. trust me, that's bigger ball wax. 

also numbers looking rates? overall country may 2% US graph looks sketchy touch slightly different areas so.... Also warry drove up. long story less likely regular physician talks risks rewards preventative care. Louisiananian reporting in:

It sucks guys. got vaccinated turn...I work, called around &amp; got put ""extra/expiring doses"" list. Got 1st shot Feb 12th. 2nd March 12th. several months feeling good...and shit show.

 I've locked old folks (Dad &amp; MIL) again. means grocery shopping 3 households again. top that, policing masking inside store yet again.

I'm exhausted. I'm mentally drained. need vacation.

If Louisiana, please...do part &amp; encourage every person know get shot. 

I know soon &amp; aware coming, TOTALLY unprepared would make feel. Maybe worth some. family member got Moderna stating he's sure get booster. said felt pretty sick two days. hope changes mind, he's high risk. Perhaps initially got different vaccine concerns. Yeah many times repeat story leaders get hint premature declare victory virus stops racking killcount? Great news, sure isn‚Äôt attempt divert attention CDC‚Äôs chicken recall? already home tester Cue Quite fascinating.

This good proof concept COVID-19 eradication, several countries jurisdictions achieved elimination without vaccination, using new established public health social measures (PHSMs) (eg, border control, physical distancing, mask wearing, testing contact tracing supported genome sequencing). Successful jurisdictions included vast land borders China, high population densities Hong Kong, also island nations Iceland New Zealand, although occasional outbreaks border control failures brought control.

Non-vaccine strategies also play huge role. Welp.   Good thing got both! Remember Texas Florida led charge masking precautions months ago, prior variants didn‚Äôt immediately blow consequence celebrated heroes certain ‚Äúside‚Äù political aisle? sure do, how‚Äôs looking now? getting sick post vaccination rare, still uncommon. vaccines help slow spread substantially. nuance lost. Damn. Wild days. happened Ol‚Äô Greg‚Äôs bootstraps?  clean mess purposely ~~made~~ continue make, nothing stop making.

Minor clarification. ‚Äúplan‚Äù involves prevention whatsoever.   History look kindly him. story history books 100 years ruined response covid. like spanish flu. No, book burning own. feel need to. knocking anyone vaccinated doesn‚Äôt get vaccinated don‚Äôt symptoms. Y‚Äôall already part It‚Äôs news. US CDC recommended Americans wear mask indoors whether we‚Äôre vaccinated not. That‚Äôs ‚Äúclickbait‚Äù fear mongering, that‚Äôs government warning us we‚Äôre danger need protect ourselves.

You can‚Äôt sit pretend sensationalist news‚Ä¶ Florida DoH could tell everyone number. Well, put direct democratic vote, majority people vaccinated want undergo lockdown protect minority people chose vaccinated.

If want die COVID, get vaccine. is‚Ä¶.a bit overkill someone fully vaccinated. Also saying temporary hunkering pretty rich considering we‚Äôre 18 months this. hope immune-compromised vaxxed people get go hospital, unvaxxed get cots tents. Friend attended packed indoor wedding 100-150 guests traveling multiple states, presumed vaccinated, zero social distancing masks wearing. 

What odds testing positive, and/or becoming silent carrier? Trying convince quarantine better yet get tested. rarely look fb, opened day see friend mine elementary school died 31 due covid. Married 10 years, 2 kids, gave birth covid positive, put ventilator heart failure died. Pretty jarring actually, left assume un vaxxed. sure getting pretty close home though time passes!

I also cousin who's whole family anti vaccine covid atm said lethargic could barely get couch. another friend mine vaccine covid positive said like worst cold life.

Shits real there! worries, important distinction make. Breakthroughs still rare hospitalizations even rarer yet. article suggests would likely recommendation.

Of course always possible Pfizer might delta specific booster time. pedantic 70% adults one shot, half country total. It‚Äôs possible, still tall order.

In San Francisco, 85% residents 12 older received least one dose, 78% fully vaccinated. Nevertheless, despite high compliance indoor masking, SF seeing big exponential uptick number cases. Lockdown 3030 then?

Polio's vaccination campaign took decades. disease thrives nasty environments poor sanitation, solving already great step. affects once, vaccine simple drop, low tech solution even need syringe. Polio also large number asymptomatic cases, unlike covid, nobody gives slightest flying fuck asymptomatic polio. people want return life unless covid eradicated, meanwhile, consider every mild case tragedy.

Imagine required 2-5 hours per year. country actually utilized lockdowns ever literally everyone stay home, even Wuhan. main issue really works lockdowns US interstate travel can't really stopped. Basically this, feel real ""benefit"" less tested, less positive. 
If everyone got tested (monthly) example, would bet positive case numbers many locations would increase. [That's way viruses way airborne thought possible even begun reckon means ventilation systems things masks initially recommended due fundamental bedrock assumption medicine totally wrong. article fascinating. going stores accept exposed virus, especially spread asymptomatically. know aren‚Äôt actually back square one sure feels like it. delta surge makes feel like never end COVID anxiety stay. Jokes assuming taking advantage manpower underprivileged peoples MO poor entity. Anecdotally, husband moderna Pfizer. fever; 103. felt like hangover, told thought dying (for 6 hours). Miami Dade worst hit!!! Delta doesn‚Äôt fuck around. come see you!! Germany's numbers way even Delta peaks.

Someone tell differently, cos getting control really good. Ontario Canada - giving never know going get sign arrive. wish would ok boosters dad meds interfered vaccine antibody test negative. ‚òπÔ∏è faulty logic. Mutations likely occur people become infected. breakthrough infections occur, happen less frequently vaccinated. vaccinations = less opportunity virus mutate. agree sucks it‚Äôs way is‚Ä¶ unvaccinated unfortunately drag us along them. Omg bail. crazy?! FL 20% POS RATE Yes, US currently position lockdown would useful, there's point suggesting them. Looks like   covid December, blood pressure high. gave water pill able control blood pressure covid. it‚Äôs controlled, plus intense cardiovascular exercises. eating could better. Also donated blood four weeks ago still antibodies. worried reaction BP know strong reaction second dose Moderna. Fever, chills nausea. stayed bed day. get J&amp;J, rather Moderna. However, second shot way back January. actually go getting booster shot? Something tells can't walk pharmacy ask... don‚Äôt want it? lockdown that's actually purposeful, like UK kept certain restrictions enough people vaccinated, make sense. However, lockdown without securing higher vaccination rates place us back situation soon lockdown ends.

Too many people think lockdowns Get-Out-Of-COVID-Free card, they're not. delta alpha beta strain mutation too. son tested positive! I‚Äôm vaccinated, he‚Äôs not. got symptoms Saturday - extremely mild. slight fever Saturday, body aches fatigue etc. 

Just got tested. doubts rapid tests they‚Äôre could get. Let‚Äôs see finally it! parent comment replied eugdot mentioned kids really curious happen ICU's filled we're back triage

I think it‚Äôs pretty safe say you‚Äôll start see stuff close happens You‚Äôll need buy new one every months wire coating split plug. Kn95 similar? think anyone claiming masks (of type) 100% effective. Even cloth mask almost certainly help reduce spread amount, no? hope get booster soon. Right. Diseases eradicate kind one exposure grants strong, long lasting immunity. care infection reduce spread

There's scientific data showing infected fully-vaxxeds infectious unvaxxeds, infectious all. Israeli study shows, half breakthrough cases using PCR tests, antigen tests pick virus. Let alone level high enough infectious. cannot concluded person infectious based positive PCR tests. PCR tests measure viral RNAs come active virus well as... dead virus (which fully-vaxxed mostly sheds.) knocked butt days jabs. second shot‚Äôs side effects slightly tolerable. Remember certain blood type taking lot Vitamin supposed huge game changers overcome virus? Funny little panned out. Pfizer got wrecked. 102+ degree fever, crazy chills, digestive stuff, serious full body pain, basically everything. Wife found middle night getting water asked doing. said horrible asked smiling. Simply said looks like working. 2nd Moderna shot, fever would break felt like full body arthritis. Like every joint head toe aching throbbing. aweful, would invest funeral homes? going bet something fact moderna dose much higher leading larger buildup nAb (of course immune response, timing, factors influence well) therefore concentration higher longer. seen results yet tracks nAB levels time groups could explain it. lead man reason, can't make think. Yep, right. cases only. didn‚Äôt see y‚Äôall discussing cases vs hospitalization missed republicans. Si broader point grew even 90s (surely least 20s) survived wildly greater dangers kid. Again, whole argument white knuckle airplane calm car: greater risk car. FAR. 

I'm suggesting go back 60s cars (deathtraps) still far relatively dangerous things kids. 

Did worry endlessly RSV kids 2? Surely not. IMO simple.

Either everyone gets vaccinated wear masks short interval reached.

Or get everyone vaccinated, lock still wear masks.

There's ""no masks"" option. there's one path ""masks less time"".

Why, oh why, 2 separate administrations, year half, communicate two two options available?

Instead, Trump said need anything, Biden saying go back way things hope vaccines alone enough. hope I‚Äôm wrong. Mild hypertension side effects whatsoever. pretty clear US herd immunity couple months ago

Unless seroprevalence survey cite, fact ""pretty clear"" Yes. FL gubernatorial impeachment process. FL courts would remove too. Cases. need stop looking caseload point. start telling high number hospitalizations vaccinated people I‚Äôll start worry. God forbid catch Covid, I‚Äôm vaccinated, I‚Äôll quarantine feel safe. I'm happy town vaccination rate 80% 18 over. Fully vaccinated. think 71% residents.  made wrong assumptions argument, sorry confused.

What mean?  Making vaccines mandatory government job. lockdown vaccination rates rise, we're going eventually situation lockdown ends. won‚Äôt stop people unmasked gatherings going restaurants

This part feel ridiculous school's mask mandate. masks, college 100% back normal. people leave classroom, masks go immediately. don‚Äôt mean vaccinating children, referring booster (3rd shot). Idk. He‚Äôs pissed lot parents old people. people FL know someone infected infected severely. It‚Äôs hitting closer home vs last year. see long lasts kids...now kids getting COVID hospital beds medical staff sparse. Going jail pwn libs!  hills die on...  Would effect birth control efficacy well? Thank you! idea find studies like volunteer for? How'd register get 3rd dose? think official guidance CDC 3rd specific people.

I family member immunocompromised moment. thinking asking oncologist 3rd makes sense. forget fraction elderly actually problem anti-vax kids discouraging going get vaccinations. get tested it‚Äôs officially counted. lot counties free testing sites opened now. really stand show leadership. pretty much thinking I've heard since last March. ended global lost real chance eradicate nature coronaviruses. hope continuous widespread vaccination (ha) minimize death effects novel virus human body, plus natural infections obviously take place, get point virus runs room mutate settles fit form circulates endemically. mean, I'm expert field feels like consensus me. back normal now? Perhaps need designate set number beds unvaccinated covid patients remaining beds everybody else. Oxygen administered using new micro-USB-c line Even classes, generally speaking want blow nose front teachers students. would leave area, blow nose come back. Keep doubld bubbled can. really shitshow right now. 80% capacity yesterday.  I'm sure lockdowns answer tone comments completely unnecessary unhelpful. 

Prior vaccine, believe locked done sooner aggressively protect everyone society especially lower income employees often work direct face-to-face service industries.

Many industry locked employ individuals restaurants, bars, movie theaters etc. employees would exposed covid order pay rent feed families. Yet, industries closed, received weekly compensation often paychecks, able avoid occupational hazard working type industries would exposed various sectors country taken pandemic seriously.  I've read seen, lockdown measures, including unemployment insurance, stimulus packages, rent relief programs done help ""poor racialized"" say hurt them. 

On side, average middle income families work data communication sector employment simply switch work online lockdown. greatly mischaracterize things say they're usually leisurely enjoying backyards. 


What sickens ax grind mischaracterize reality order push narrative . almost like saying poor workers deemed essential exposed covid rather lockdowns exist poor workers go work exposed covid. hope whatever America find way help many people possible especially vulnerable without safety nets. don‚Äôt need 300 million immune herd immunity. alpha anyway, knows delta. 

Btw it‚Äôs distinctly possible 150 million Americans covid. Likely, even. Surely find ecnomical solution pandemic least societal impact

Agree, imo, think assumed least societal impact would best economical solution since ppl could keep working. also think job enforce since authority belong them, blindly, might well have, disregarding public health advice.

Vaccines 100%. also think may sound weird, masks still take precedence. infections allow, chances next variant. Removing mask mandates time promoting vaccines didnt really make sense. comment weird overlap removed everything _before_ securing vaccination rates.

Sorry, kinda drawn out. Thats odd, thought Texas open business. telling private companies turn away valuable customers? That's need make life hard humanly possible unvaccinated take away creature comforts little bread circus events keep going day day. Treat like kids ground they're supposed do. Why? COVID issue Texas, it? yeah, needing wear mask step far. irony issuing palpable There‚Äôs bunch people parents nursing homes nervously waiting day vaccinated people start dropping dead CDC say, ‚ÄúOh yeah, let‚Äôs get third shot now‚Äù. data probably good political pressure keep low. That's CDC operates - political organization. scientific one. bits news gathered India/Nepal outbreak. believe seen scientific study topic yet.

It grown delta anywhere last 2 months. Let's make real juicy call Santini's death variant. I‚Äôm France it‚Äôs approved immunocompromised. People using tiny bit herd immunity vaccinated people justify getting vaccine. Well, that‚Äôs working anymore. Pfizer here, doses kicked ass different ways, first tolerable didn‚Äôt sleep night. Dose 2 wicked. tested covid since pandemic began. Think may infected January 2020 never know I'm going lie, correct.

""Florida church members die COVID-19"" title made think vaccine denier congregation, deal listening nonsense again. states apparently knew better letting people ""be charge health"" seeing effects. Oh well. mandate likely save thousands lives...
It boggles mind. sure. weather def one factor. mentioned comparing IL FL. live Orlando crowded TP area, so. even beaches! agree Singapore one ""gold standards"" pandemic response. also possible they're authoritarian small country.

What's different vaccine mandate? already exist children? away then? literally agreed leaders fucked big time. colossal fuck end. look anti mask anti vaxx movements. individual level bullshit. blame ends. Even government handled pandemic perfectly didn‚Äôt, dumbasses would spread virus anyways. Even ended lockdown orders still mask mandates place. enforced much seriously everyone voluntarily followed leader‚Äôs directions would done covid April 2020. reaction either P thankfully. study months ago clearly showed side effects we're prevalent Moderna vs Pfizer. two Pfizer felt absolutely side effects. think majority people don‚Äôt feel anything, make point share news. aren‚Äôt everywhere. niece 8th grade schools haven‚Äôt planned dances really extracurricular.

I‚Äôd say 20% wear masks. even vaccinated don‚Äôt wear masks here. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Sure, wouldn‚Äôt get 3 doses didn‚Äôt think  I‚Äôve many people don‚Äôt need take precautions they‚Äôve ‚Äúalready it‚Äù. P.S. contains vague arguments fear mongering, may imagine. says also Delta variant might six month event rather two year one indeed chance super variant appear, low/unlikely. grow up. old suspect? consider decades mentioned passed?

Holy fucking shit dense. people grow 8n 90's 2000's 2010's?

You think I'm 60 worrying young children? Ventricles, course agree everything said. thing though Principal HS things listed dances, movies, etc still happening. man fit run taco stand. People going wear N95 prolonged period time. entire subreddit delusional going wear one. uncomfortable, tight, general fun wear. wear mine 6+ hours day tell average American can't bothered miss favorite TV show putting much discomfort. Where‚Äôs state 20% hospitalizations vaccinated people? I‚Äôve seen like 1-5%. made die street don‚Äôt continue work.

Do understand many people work throughout lockdowns keep society running? understand people tend poorer worse access health care? There's thing ""lockdown"" people. Abbott pipe bursts basement? US least case, CNN (rather CDC) whomever posted like clearly misleading title.

Actual title: ""More 99.99% fully vaccinated people severe breakthrough case, CDC data suggests"" want end constant fear/anxiety/stress/panic brings $$$$$$$ reported misinformation. Trying create doubt zero evidence. No, got vaccination live life. life life am. Surely isn‚Äôt Greg Abbott issued executive order prohibiting cities enacting mask vaccine mandates? surely isn‚Äôt Greg Abbott stated covid-19-related operating limits business establishment?

I mean odds what?

There's pretty great documentary Post-Covid future looks like. called Death Stranding. prior COVID infection doses, especially second, put ass. peaked 103 second dose.

I didn‚Äôt know many Pfizer friends harsh side effects. Except whole issue breakthroughs 20% infections hospitalizations. Im old enough remember people kept flooding sub parrot ""look Florida, everyone drop restrictions open everything, two weeks cases going down"" 

What happened people high vaccination clear see difference. Add fact somewhere like Australia virtually natural immunity.

Also, pretty clear U.S. following China's lead here. hope children's parents thank governor Desantis!! good news pay extra get infected it. Table 4 says 12.6% spontaneous abortions, within normal range 10-26% pregnancies end spontaneous abortions. see figure 82%? I‚Äôm sure areas without restrictions it‚Äôs everything back normal. might fall deaf ears. It‚Äôs true people inside, don‚Äôt think account whole problem. Phoenix Arizona seeing 100+ temps week, virus isn‚Äôt completely control there. fully vaccinated 45% population (compared Florida‚Äôs 49%). 

One big difference two states Arizona population density 63 Florida‚Äôs 400.

Florida damn crowded. even added 300k people last year! state growing quickly. mean, go grocery store Tampa Bay, it‚Äôs impossible get aisle without passing three four people. course hardly anyone wearing mask now, so... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We‚Äôll see goes north winter people pack in, I‚Äôm expecting Florida get better ‚Äúgood‚Äù season. *largely* preventing hospitalizations deaths, key. less effective reducing transmission Delta compared previous variants. Vaccinated people get highest priority. I‚Äôm shocked, everyone fit healthy climbing mountains‚Ä¶actually think thinking Colorado. countries use Moderna most? Switzerland? dunno man. Enlighten me. One less spoken aspects COVID something extra top usual emergencies.  

A person heart attack likely need ICU bed much COVID case. Currently, US government encouraging boosters, likely point later year. believe would able get one currently even wanted to, barring lying vaccination status. Keep mind, people Florida died covid number votes by. Students 12 need vaccinations attend school. support mandatory vaccinations students anyone working campus.

With regards 12, saying results studies done 2 months, others point end year. Waiting months using online learning smart safe thing do. 

No child fail master subjects waiting little amount time. Sadly go school end hospital result. 

As teachers, know teach online (particularly different tech available). Creating engaging lesson challenging impossible. Kids watch YouTube TV. realm reality think learning done online. described exact reason lockdowns popular. I'm gonna use one, see butthurt cons trigger. Yes, date. CDC provide numbers daily.

Are claiming numbers correct explaining thought cases lower person claimed? would assume college newspaper got figures CDC.  **MISLEADING TITLE**

Real title: ""More 99.99% fully vaccinated people severe breakthrough case, CDC data suggests""

So, CNN rather CDC spreading statistical nonsense (at least case) P.S. despite sensationalism fear mongering words, says Delta might six month phenomenon instead two year one, variants may totally evade vaccines low chance appear, impossible though. summed I've thinking last weeks.

Bravo! Presumably point treatment/vaccines advance point virus becomes comparable common cold. When? Nobody knows, hopefully within year two. delta plus mutation K417N previously found alpha variants Beta.  coworker boycotts safety glasses calls stupid. Hospitals Texas asked help/extra staff state week ago denied, anyone wondering. Abbott says shit ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è K-12 *excluded.* CVS Walgreens require ID Insurance info.

So sign online, fill forms. slightly modified address, declined provide insurance info, take ID.

When arrived pharmacy, even ask ID, do, say forgot.

DONT mention got 2 shot, legally cannot give 3rd one. Even though vaccinated Moderna 100% provax feel pretty good protected due vaccination lifestyle, reports map respect efficacy. Several states state income tax aren‚Äôt run buffoons. really misleading though? Provides context anecdotal stories breakthrough cases. Turns out, super duper rare.

It would lot meaningful compared stat unvaccinated folks doubt, doesn‚Äôt strike crazy misleading. wild watch. Holy shit. supreme leader trump got vax. people blindly following lead? They‚Äôre not, got too. Canadians wild way!

Our Pfizer supply running low, lot people becoming eligible second doses, huge shipment Moderna finally came in. Moderna chronically late short shipments, finally made it. pragmatic public health authorities decided since they‚Äôre mRNA vaccines, we‚Äôll treat interchangeable. See now, school superintendent gloves would come I'd implement mask mandate hard. Fuck DeSantis. Yeah. I've already work year half pandemic. I'm going risk things still bad late 2022. Australia five lockdowns, perhaps work? You‚Äôre absolutely right. Running taco stand successfully requires effort, skill, hard work. would prefer say Abbot isn‚Äôt fit charge anything requires ability, effort, intelligence, integrity running ‚ÄúEssential Oils‚Äù franchise parent‚Äôs garage. He‚Äôs truly garbage person, let‚Äôs leave delicious life giving tacos it, please. Absolutely. fool proof point. Many people let shields prematurely here. Vaccination doesnt perfectly parallel immunity. 

That anecdote also shared pure frustration lack safety measures I‚Äôm experiencing Florida. teacher, vaccinated, feel risk year prior since ZERO precautions place state district. Last year measures taken.  Texas!! need help outside states!!! /s Here's study: self-reported survey incidences mild reactions 1 2 doses vaccines 0 7 days vaccination. table report pretty clearly shows Moderna recipients experienced reactions Pfizer recipients, especially second dose. believe assessed severity individual reactions.

Moderna falling slower still falling.

And lambda epsilon becoming concern...

Yeah definitely need boosters..  Shot 1, lot fatigue. Basically deathly tired 2-3 days. sore arm. all, bad. Get Friday, sleep weekend.

Shot 2, Sore arm, way less bad shot 1. Mild fever (100f) first night fever associated symptoms (chills, joint/body aches etc). Tired, bad shot 1. Fever gone morning. tired next day gone completely next. 

In many ways shot 2 milder shot 1, minus fever. 

Pfizer though. Lucky lol. Thanks! sure that, pretty sure depends person side effects. We're quickly heading back March 2020. Actually latest data UK aligns Israel

Protection infection: Evidence Israel shows Pfizer 39% effective preventing infection Delta, evidence UK shows 49%

Symptomatic infection: Evidence UK shows 59% protection vs symptomatic infections

Hospitalization: Evidence Israel shows Pfizer prevents 81% hospitalizations (for years old) another study found hospitalization rate Delta 85% higher variants. However, evidence UK shows 96% effectiveness hospitalizations.

Israel: Granted, Pfizer sore shoulder first shot - fee days. Nothing second. affect people differently.  I‚Äôm almost begging deltas combination infecting almost unvaccinated people increasing vaccination rates helps us get closer end pandemic. Maybe it‚Äôs dream also mandatory vaccines didn‚Äôt couple weeks ago help too

let antivaxxers die. long around endanger rest us got Moderna glad side effects 2nd dose.. meant triggering immune response therefore working. Intense body aches/headache 24 hours, imagined body superhero armor modifications installed. ü§ì

From understood, zero side effects might mean weaker immune system Covid recently. 'Side effects' sounds negative, calling immune system responses instead would palatable. like little details get way things. all, War making powers reside congress, president basically power congress tried take back.

I feel pretty level-headed reasonable take situation. Hopefully find it. Yeah, percent 62% even vote? Good them! I‚Äôm glad populace cares protecting others. Since covid, vaccines likely give side-effects; good part J&amp;J go once. brunt J&amp;J side-effects lasted 10 hours, main symptom pretty intense fatigue. regret one bit would heartbeat to.  1 day horrible flu symptoms VS possibility two weeks horrible flu symptoms w/ possible hospitalization death. East choice make. Lol wtf  beating Florida? Everything‚Äôs bigger Texas! politics. history. lot people aware nation founded vaccine mandate.  patriotic duty.

George Washington forced entire continental army get vaccinated small pox. Betcha $100 gotten vaccine herself. states Governors state legislatures passing laws favor letting Covid spread borders shut down. surprised ""mental fog"" people describe covid symptoms could trigger temporary dementia onset cause similar symptoms. case lady mentioned normal signs dementia covid (lost talking capacity, recognise people understand was) medicine gave treat triggered worse bout (it known effect). changing medication, symptoms subsided weeks later came back mostly normal. sooner 15 year olds get vaccinated, sooner masks go away forever life comes back normal. You‚Äôll able go school dances, live music, movies, whatever you‚Äôre to, faster everyone gets vaccinated. 

Basically, neither covid vaccine pose real risk you. You‚Äôll likely totally fine either. vaccine poses *way less* risk covid. there‚Äôs .1% chance you‚Äôll get seriously sick covid, there‚Äôs .001% chance you‚Äôll get seriously sick vaccine (not exact numbers), makes sense get it. sad, right seems inevitable Florida might show us

It‚Äôs almost trying fuck every aspect purposely. think Moderna people side effects. also larger amount shot. think exactly opposite maybe going Pfizer 3rd shot point. timing isn‚Äôt surprising. Wish they‚Äôd hurry authorize boosters. dimwitted morons won‚Äôt take shot, I‚Äôll gladly take booster alternative tossing doses expire highly contagious disease caused virus, usually results high fever rash, lead blindness, encephalitis death. end 2020, 84% children received one dose measles-containing vaccine second birthday, 179 Member States included second dose part routine immunization 70% children received two doses measles vaccine according national immunization fact measles MUCH contagious, 70% recieved two doses 84% recieved one dose, according saying would mean measles would still spreading across globe considering R0 value 18 compared COVID's 2/2.4. course know hard say considering we've lived measles long prior vaccines, even delta strain value double (5 more), still mean need 90% reach herd immunity.

1. Measles vaccines effective (93-97%) covid vaccine tackling current variants concern.

2. said, higher proportion overall population already measles antibodies widespread vaccination efforts began. 70% kids fully vaccinated mean 70% general population antibodies. effect we‚Äôve piggybacking older population providing herd immunity undervaxxed population children.

3. areas measles vaccination rates dipped, see outbreaks.

4. Measles longer endemic populations, shows typically manageable number cases contact traced isolated. It‚Äôs also pretty easy spot. CDCs go hands deck snuff measles outbreaks. Covid get point eventually, again, we‚Äôre yet. There‚Äôs much virus floating around. 

5. sure you‚Äôre referring R 2-2.4. Delta shown somewhere around 7. vaccines come immediately (obviously impossible) ring vaccinations begun around outbreaks R 2-2.4, would negative growth ages take novel example, Swine Flu know R0 lower COVID, recent example another pandemic could find.

Swine flu R0 1.5 - even lower Covid classic. Bringing R 1 scenario requires much much lower threshold actions. Localized lockdowns, mask wearing, transportation screening contact tracing pretty much neutered swine flu long even got vaccines arms. also never became nearly widespread top that, know we've found traces COVID-19 dating back previously thought, we've obviously living disease quite already. likely high percentage people even know they've already immune.

As September 2020, fewer 1 10 Americans Covid antibodies. true covid circulating earlier first thought, competitively low rates. takes time exponential growth get going. Hence nowhere, suddenly everywhere. 1. Getting vaccinated helps ensure mask requirements end sooner later. 

2. Vaccines reduce risk spreading virus others either can‚Äôt get vaccinated due health issues people vaccinated health issues make vulnerable reinfection. 

3. delta variant appears greater threat young people. 

4. euphoric, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm vaccinated!‚Äù feeling. chest pain hurt rate 100 night sleep. odd. Yeah, I'm antibody test week see reacted Sinovac, I've seen around 2% people get antibodies general levels way less viral vector mRNA vaccines. getting booster 1-3 months I'd get 1 dose, given next year I'm thinking 2 may better especially considering Moderna probably easier vaccine travel with. know I‚Äôve noticed ‚Äúunmask kids‚Äù idiots?

It‚Äôs virulent. 70% fully vaccinated still struggling keep latest cluster control full mask wearing, lots government effort semi lockdown. Way back first week March 2020, in-laws Korea asked us buy masks sanitizer US mail running short.

During month took us get packages, everything control Korea, *we* ones needing masks sanitizer. Sir, aware 98% survival rate? /s 2nd shot Moderna knocked ass day after.

Painfully accurate. freakin‚Äô WISH. NZ accepting applications fully vaxxed Texans fleeing home county? say 2nd shot Moderna inflamed good bit pain 24 hrs. regrets, though would heartbeat. threaten *everyone.*

It‚Äôs matter time another variant emerges (which could render vaccines less effective) due rate spread among unvaxxed. Gottlieb steady, consistent, largely correct throughout pandemic. I‚Äôve listening someone like walensky fired instead. Could worse. Good question. make people finally get vaccine? Getting get fired otherwise show kind progress. Getting full FDA approval might something though.  8 months though still gotten vaccine character problem. billion people fully vaccinated entire medical community behind it. gotten board tough justify. You‚Äôre giving Trump much credit. people would‚Äôve made decisions even Trump never born. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è sweet summer child. wait. You‚Äôll see. look Abbott same.

I wont even remember tomorrow sweetheart, whatever helps sleep night Gottlieb voice reason pandemic. However I‚Äôve learned count future predictions they‚Äôve wrong much they‚Äôve right. vaccines work. see would politicizing things.

Unlike Republicans, invented stoked conspiracy theories virus, safety children, motive behind lockdowns, bullshit cures, safety vaccine, inevitable moment get lazy blame immigrants. That's freedom speech research. really want get 9yr old done too. one kids look you‚Äôre sick gets sick. Terrible immune system. Makes nervous. Hoping release vaccine soon them. Maybe Someone said GR masked kids daughter whispered me, ‚ÄúI like mask. haven‚Äôt gotten sick year.‚Äù see certain group people come back sub-reddit. see we're going one last wave north flu/holiday season like last year. *That* final wave. Mostly. child Houston flown hundreds miles away ICU capacity yet. Well, time Pfizer shots go *get fucked* guess! It‚Äôs storm there. children 12 getting sick, can‚Äôt even vaccinated yet. spouse's unit got 90% vaccination strong leadership levels. They're different pages politically one leaders called hesitating right out, said safety issue, political issue. grateful working person since beginning even precautions many gotten sick. Well kinda Deja Vu, time lot people caring, masks, everyone crowding places again. India third word country? Sadly, it‚Äôs talking point I‚Äôve seen echoed elsewhere, especially Facebook. horrible truth lot people refusing get vaccinated constant misinformation campaigns. don‚Äôt think Covid going epidemic fall winter ‚Ä¶ *assuming don‚Äôt variant emerge pierces immunity offered prior infection vaccination*,‚Äù


Yes. lot assumptions there. Dr Gottlieb see what's happening Florida? effectively coronavirus petri dish breeding new strains point. much I'd love end year, I'm holding breath. Yes, can't really speak that. mask mandate sports etc last year year. Life basically normal outside headlines news. nice state high vax rate. see LA upping vax total though encouraging. society large sending us possibly deaths start pandemic little protective gear hazard pay.

Any illusion people society whole working whole looking gone. best look try minimize collateral damage might cause others, maybe help others want help themselves. it'll much worse winter. We'll see. Covid hit idea wearing masks, even knowledge effective, wasn‚Äôt really people‚Äôs radar US. get butt-hurt someone caring immune compromised people understand risks may may work seems bit silly. anyone suggest reusable masks actually stock kids lab tested? Yes mate, agreeing you. logic abolish travelling, socializing entertainment industry like, forever. Unfortunately vaccination isn‚Äôt fool proof. partner went back work vaccinated caught covid within first month (service industry), 2 Pfizer JJ vaccinated employees. hospital visits, day 18 still can‚Äôt stand long enough go back work. 

(I add: We‚Äôre Florida, everything control one cares.üî•) also need negative test well vaccinated enter Canada American good knows. went beer tasting thousands people everyone touching rim glass filling cup. went 4 crowded bars hour roughly strip club Uber home. 


Tested negative 3 times (rapids) next 10 days. Maybe vaccines work, maybe it‚Äôs luck. 


That said lived life fear beer tasting. could count 2 hands many times saw friends since March 2020. Maybe people spend time air conditioning inside summer South? neducable IDIOT.

When resort name calling, prove lost argument. I'm fully aware going September. Pfizer said bunch cases myocarditis, expanding size test group. point claimed supposed approved already, showed pfizer plans approved September demolishing supposition. Merely proving pfizer's findings adjustments reason delayed secondary point. go one happily wrong calling people names run ways actually argue facts. constitution short sighted document. see reason would eradicated. We've successfully eradicated one 5 6 known coronaviruses, nearly transmissible SARS-CoV-2. seems like magical thinking. really point we‚Äôre going taking pandemic advice Randall Flagg? vaccine prevents those? cousins going school tomorrow FL. They‚Äôre vaccinated wear mask. youngest one can‚Äôt take covid vaccine yet. hope stay safe allow younger 12 years old. Suppose depends quite anti vax RN's area. Granted went 80%+ Trump 100 miles nearest city. know RN's fully board 5G, microchip, etc nonsense. Delta White probably number admissions really small. statistics work well small numbers.  believe died. Abbott saying illegals.. yeah right state databases. sure insurance. I'm sure they're looking uninsured people.

They check charge insurance rather government, insurance pays bucks more.   got email ad saying ‚ÄúDelta Vacations‚Äù kind shuddered. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre thrilled. Human tragedy aside- fucking idiot going cause kinds economic damage state. 

Asking hospitals cancel elective surgeries asking take huge financial hit. Something felt hospital staff. fucking turns around requests expenditure time effort part healthcare professionals he‚Äôs actively undermining professionally economically. Fuck moron. 

This doesn‚Äôt even account lost productivity wages everyone suffer due massive surge resulting fallout. Gov Abbott sabotaging local economy putting untold lives risk culture war bullshit. It‚Äôs tragic I‚Äôd upset, wasn‚Äôt sure blow face. that, I‚Äôm for. lies huh.  end near No. information that‚Äôs kept far away people possible. They're saying talk breakthroughs. way rate presenting misleading. better way judge risk would know per capita rate vaccinated people.

So ideally report would show two numbers:

* X new cases per 100,000 vaccinated people.

* new cases per 100,000 unvaccinated people.

This better judging real risk shows risk breakthrough area better. different headline number factors population level vaccination rate.

Wapo article Well, went socialized without masks 30-50 percent population vaccinated. expect‚Äîa miracle? massive confidence intervals ICU admission... anyone recommend mask liner it? used Halyard one day clinic liked liner prevented loose threads getting face tickling me. Hoping get quickly. Thanks Source vaccinations expiring? remember everyone last year said thing spring 2021 :/ involves virtual school,

Lol. Virtual school useless. Get vaccinated fine. lot people really mad wear cloth face. like, get kids back school, need there. really worried economy fragile egos. course, working gym.

They also scientists read article No, many pointing doesn‚Äôt help large population already vaccinated. gives appearance something really doesn‚Äôt much - especially compared vaccines fact nothing stopping people gathering unvaccinated parties think passed law requiring unvaccinated employees mask. made masks required workplace again, big factor decision want litigate employees vaccinated haven't. talk human level think get jab, dont want enforce masks unvaccinated employees company policy. all. bet factor decision well. comply law requiring unvaccinated employees mask, unmasked unvaccinated employees sparks cases, could conceivably sued. changed recommendations new science comes out.

It's like complaining spoiled food :


""You told banana yellow last month, come changed mind? even trust now?"" thing gets whenever there's like mass casualty incident usually preventable people died lost lives affecting kids like three kids Florida age 16 recently died past weeks covid preventable taking vaccine yet baffled people common sense. Damn right. Abbot piece shit I‚Äôd rather mini honestly idea. surprised hear say this. happens play politics pandemic. Florida even worse.

If healthcare professional either state, exit time another state new field, This. Absolutely spot-on. prove proven like article researched studied i'd like read Polio great apes rarely. reaction either Pfizer shots. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   Yeah. Smallpox animal reservoirs. Polio rarely infect great primates really happen wild.

COVID lots animal reservoirs. know literally lick toilet seats prove covid real. can, actually. saying grid favorite part living here. Honestly good part lack state income tax. technically can. Thats true, though predictions fairly accurate throughout whole thing whatever thats worth. Covid cases increasing winter around corner, looking good‚Ä¶ No, we're *not* back again. people died April/May 2020 innocent victims.

These willful ignorant. don‚Äôt get final wave? know lot immunity many countries many left unvaccinated, Covid likely going always us. bad sure maybe he‚Äôs talking about? think opinion book burning planet burning actually... can't burn fast enough. crazy, already happens time there's mass casualty incident overwhelms local emergency responders. Everyone medical sector understands basic idea behind triage. 

Hell, native language, emergency room fact called ""the triage room."" Well, least admit selfishness then. want lollipop? maybe pretend shot airplane coming landing. 

It‚Äôs difficult take pro-Covid party seriously begged talk like children.   Delta motherfucker. recommended CDC even trust CDC saying multiple different things No, get fucking vaccinated. Jesus. Expiring? Come now. I‚Äômin favor boosters hyperbolic. Help first, dipshit. Try masks. need socially responsible CDC says so? I‚Äôm wondering see lot people talking protecting immunosuppressed people never saw pre-covid. find disingenuous think people like use leverage political opinion. 

As one people (apparently) desperate protect, I‚Äôm good thanks. I‚Äôve dealing risks like two decades I‚Äôll continue deal lost interest coronavirus hobby move something else. 

Not looking debate (I certainly don‚Äôt want give pleasure) I‚Äôm tired ‚ÄúbUt iMMunOsUPpreSsEd pEopLe??‚Äù Y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt never gave shit became valid strategy winning Reddit debates.  Well, I'm sure August Texas pleasant. live 90 minutes away Burlington. used nice day trip. That's shortsighted. federal government plenty tools available incentivize whatever want. able directly order state-level lockdown matter slightest. could use things control make choice can't refused. 

That said, I'm arguing one way fed - point matter one single bit established legal precedents regarding executive power lockdowns. that's result want, plenty things absolutely within power could use get it. get it, either. wear mask work. I've working person entire pandemic. Masks big deal. 

Do love wearing mask? No. masking hardship overwhelming majority us. tone comments completely unnecessary unhelpful.

Sorry, care. ""tone"" matters vaccine, believe lockdowns done sooner aggressively protect everyone society especially lower income employees often work direct face-to-face service industries.

But ""prior industries locked employ individuals restaurants, bars, movie theaters etc. employees would exposed covid order pay rent feed families. Yet, industries closed, received weekly compensation often paychecks, able avoid occupational hazard working type industries would exposed to. Likey various sectors country taken pandemic seriously. I've read seen, lockdown measures, including unemployment insurance, stimulus packages, rent relief programs done help ""poor racialized"" say hurt them.

Hasn't experience all. support nearly good enough many working class folks. side, average middle income families often work data communication sector employment simply switch work online lockdown. work mostly done via email computers anyways continued home. greatly mischaracterize things say they're usually leisurely enjoying backyards everyone else goes work.

Right, got continue collect full paycheck, *and* avoid getting infected. absolutely privleged sickens ax grind mischaracterize reality order push narrative . almost like saying poor workers deemed essential exposed covid rather lockdowns exist poor workers go work exposed covid.

I would rather lockdowns exist *post vaccines*, blunt tool used last ditch effort. live 9 month lockdown throughout whole winter. extremely dark days, excuse think lockdown necessary every adult wants vaccine get hope whatever America find way help many people possible especially vulnerable without safety nets.

That happened past 18 months, lockdown lockdown, little faith case.  Scott Gottlieb epidemiologist. opinions experts tend wave period. Texas cities fighting back state oppressive authoritarian rules. governor claims Texans smart enough mark decisions 20k plus daily case count proves otherwise.  That's well good still find people I've dealt staffing agencies told many times one. actually brought people 500 miles away breach contract still bad. I'm saying say want, people ground talk 1000 nurses coming soon worth less 10 dying   interest get unvaccinated vaccinated

I mean, shit. pretty obvious without even considering hospital capacity, anything else. Eradication (or control, least) disease team sport half guys playing damn team.    Europe, go government page getting vaccinated get QR code show people. 

Paper‚Äôs bad idea? Ted Cruz personally paying health care bills dead kids.

Doubling ERCOT kicked ass bad tried leave country. hope make mistake choosing Pfizer. option Pfizer Moderna.  would like get 9 min mile, never Covid. I'm really shape. peach colored shaded range graph indicates ""confidence interval"", range true value might be: 62% 76% within range, dip recovery likely random variation statistics.

So people getting hospitalized vaccination know little - bottom graph's confidence intervals almost whole graph, reflects low sample size. (That's good thing!) think it‚Äôs still 10 days you‚Äôre almost there. Thanks right thing hope you‚Äôre feeling better!! I'm immunocompromised, second shot wrecked me. 102 fever horrible chills four days. awful headache, tired, achy... said, would happily 3rd dose.  Why? No, release booster targeting new variant existing vaccine effective it.

Even Texas statewide first dose rate ages 65+ 86% (source:NYT). probably explains cases spiking much fatalities remaining relatively low. getting vaccinated, given symptoms, consider getting COVID test. currently ill COVID, talk pharmacist may need wait bit recovered first. (And test comes back negative, wait, get vaccine now!)

Both Pfizer Moderna great. article talking waning protection 6 months, probably happening Moderna dosage higher. likely need booster next year anyway, either one good choice today - whatever stock pharmacy. keep hearing argument stupid fuck. First selfish. can't see people's smiling faces? child entitled see ""smiling faces."" That's problem. mentality genuinely baffles me. I've even seen sub coming people refuse mask again. necessarily. right fairly localized problem currently; states pretty OK right really handful states contributing majority cases hospitalizations. plan going be, example, kicking mass vaccination machine back distributing third dose, focused whole country. all, coronavirus ""local problem"" first. New York New Jersey northeast. wasn't. think pretty obvious many states going Florida-like curve next couple months, definitely already see seeding many states OK now. would best everyone respond soon possible - waiting hand forced take serious action massive, repetitive mistake throughout past year. much effective take action stuff gets bad.

And, often, unintended consequences ‚Äî people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.‚Äù - Dr. Anthony Fauci, March 2020

‚ÄúThere specific evidence suggest wearing masks mass population potential benefit. fact, there‚Äôs evidence suggest opposite.‚Äù- Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director health emergencies program, March 2020

‚ÄúYou increase risk getting wearing mask health care provider‚Äù - US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, March 2020

If wonder many people US doubt ‚Äúexperts,‚Äù why. research readily available back proved masks worked, zero evidence showed contrary. flip-flopped ‚Äúthe science changed,‚Äù mask shortage ended. 

And history repeating right eyes. experts flip-flopped ‚Äúvaccinated individuals can‚Äôt spread virus don‚Äôt wear masks‚Äù ‚Äúactually keep wearing them.‚Äù Again, science changed, cases rise. use shield ‚Äúscience‚Äù push public policy feel greater good. Need ration masks? ‚ÄúMasks don‚Äôt work!‚Äù Want encourage vaccinations? ‚ÄúVaccinated don‚Äôt wear masks!‚Äù Cases rising quickly? ‚ÄúJk vaccinated spread too! Mask up!‚Äù

It‚Äôs farce. It‚Äôs ending October  There's actually thread it. 

Not liking free market advantage, eh? would work people, me. don‚Äôt problem telling people I‚Äôm vaccinated, encouraging others get vaccinated. 

Most schools open next week. Several schools using lawsuits ban mask mandates reason *not* require masks. Judge already issued restraining order additional hearings scheduled. 

We think we‚Äôve seen exponential growth. students/staff wearing masks, schools even attempting social distancing, it‚Äôs going get lot worse. Australia done wonderful job contact tracing studies suggest Delta transmitted ""fleeting contact"", I'm pretty sure surgical masks buy full 60 mins Delta. 

I'm sure ever heard Dr. Osterholm, he's Director Center Infectious Disease Research Policy. Anyway, podcast listen time-to-time, gets lot flack ""anti-mask"" he's really anti-mask. tries emphasize obvious, masks created equal. Basically sharing air, masks buy time. think get away calling ""masks"" start talking value different kinds masks effectiveness certain situations.

Having said that, think ignore importance **40-60% efficacy source control masks** (u/Adodie mentioned post links). information, practically own, imho supports indoor mask mandates. However, people want minimize transmission much possible, need way informing people right types masks wear different situations. 

For example, going drive-thru, simple cloth mask surgical mask probably fine - enough barrier protect ""fleeting contact"" transmissions brief period time. Especially person wearing mask - *again, source control important*. But, going indoors prolonged period time people outside immediate household, need wear something better surgical mask. 

For children age 12, cannot yet vaccinated, need talking KN95s KF94s. Normally, would say N95s, can't seem find N95s fit small children (I found 'small' sizes, seem smaller adult faces).

Ultimately, think Governor Cox right. need giving masks better job protecting kids cloth surgical masks. also can't expect masks 100% heavy lifting. Schools going socially distance much possible, improve ventilation, utilize outdoors spaces whenever possible, practice cohorting much possible, maintain good hand hygiene sanitizing practices, list goes on... 

If things come together multi-layer approach, schools **will** able minimize spread Delta protect children. Persian girls gorgeous gotta give Swab nasal passages vaccinated people actually got infected, mean. vaxxed people. Yes. Medical mistakes serious problem, people stupid get vaccinated likely make mistakes throughout every aspect jobs. Following. find legitimate ones? correct i‚Äôm wrong governor seems stupid Florida‚Äôs governor. really sunk vulnerable people vaccinated. wave, like UK wave, far fewer deaths. number hospitalizations deeply concerning worth minor freaking out, depending live. getting kicked country taking covid back Venezuela. moved girlfriend Washington State almost every week tells happy is, Tennessee. wake everyday see shit Florida Texas happy call Washington home. Though news article also video recently saw Prime Minister England says praising lockdowns I‚Äôm hoping don‚Äôt get salads going say lockdowns best thing. Though hearing Makes wonder really wants locked like one country heard going treat like flu season yet people trying say Delta variant deadlier thought virus actually weak overtime least become deadly R number currently 1.10, 1.50 month ago. sense turned around. case numbers start decreasing soon. Can't recall him, need wait 2022 sadly. hope people Texas remember this. OnE YOuTuBe DoCtOr DiSaGrEeS! Here's article goes detail:  effect shots. 9 hours started feel effect extreme fatigue. really symptoms, fatigue boy strong. Felt like 90 years old. thing I've never strong reaction flu shot anything heard got strong reaction second shot first figure felt tired first. honestly expecting side effects. 

Second shot ready it. Drank good amount water hoping would help. Nope. Felt like 90 years old 48 hours. however Covid July last year let tell feels hell lot worse. I'll front line say booster needed.  really feel like war zone, close I‚Äôll ever get one hopefully. u enter unit ppl putting gowns u goggles n95‚Äôs double gloves shoe covers n hair covers u walk hell. Every room full ppl dying close dying. U know ur gonna short staffed barebones crew. order eat water use bathroom u need leave unit go back donning area. felt like gearing war question wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúare reasons good fire medical staff don‚Äôt get vaccine‚Äù. question ‚Äúdo pros outweigh cons firing medical staff don‚Äôt get vaccinated?‚Äù

Obviously one con decision may fire medical staff desperately need things get drastically worse. think sick then? Unknown yet. They've experimenting mix-and-match shots, certain yet whether need booster, when, whether behooves stick one got get different ""brand."" Let's wait see rush decisions.  Doesn‚Äôt even sound like worst porn plot. Exactly never stopped wearing mask. Everyone quick drop guard. Republicans suddenly thinking Iran bad country 3...2...1.. anyone able convince antivax risk parents get vaccinated? Like way trump antivax. Decades. 

My family extremely anti vax. waited data come breastfeeding moms getting shot week. I‚Äôve seen enough data look available horrified risks parents taking delta rise. even conversation topic.

Hmm, common... article says even vaccinated 70 years old risk dying 35 year old unvaccinated people, true that? It‚Äôs making freak little since vaccines people telling even young healthy stay home cause still danger apparently even you‚Äôre older vaccine you‚Äôre still risk? don‚Äôt want start worrying vaccinated parents :( 

I haven‚Äôt able find reasons IFR vaccinated older individuals.  matter, Houstonians care. care 2020 virus lethal absolutely care now. ship sailed, whatever happens happen. reason even mild optimism presence vaccinations (albeit lower frequencies would like) obviously possible 2020 - help keep mortality rates lower before.

Source: Lived Houston late 2019 summer run-ins aggressive anti-vaxxers conspiracy theorists care admit. think he‚Äôs right think we‚Äôll see ‚Äúmini wave‚Äù winter negative weight media never talks SARS COVID1 outbreak‚Ä¶I wonder is. Maybe media tell people vaccines development since much original work done time. Fucking whyyyyyyyy Moderna here, slept little extra first shot, second nothing me. good bad thing? thought read strong reaction signs healthy immune system.  Thanks, good points reassuring. go indoors without mask, prepared potentially getting mild covid. Who'd thunk Khamenei much common millions Americans comes pandemic...or anything? Perfect! time Mardi Gras. Except there's covid introduced either shot , that's vaccines work. Yes averaging 326 deaths per day lately could worked - cleared 70% vaccinated enough. death keeps following midwife... maybe try different midwife? Good point. number deaths bad thing, anywhere near peak 4000 deaths per day.

I think panic deaths quick spread variant general changes bring health system.

Additionally think messaging somewhat intended scare people getting vaccinated. would actually pretty big impact. absolutely embarrassing. US can‚Äôt give vaccines away

But US donated vaccines promised donate more. confused mean? Seems like real endgame strong, effective pancoronavirus vaccine. believe animal testing now. get that, variant escape become much harder. 22 year old girl know healthy, good diet, weight, doesn‚Äôt smoke drink pre existing conditions. long graduated nursing school, got married wedding church guest caught Covid, rough time managed recover without going hospital.

Moderna well, first shot sore arm next day felt like cheap wine hangover, pretty sure hydrated enough.
Second shit rougher, definitely flu like symptoms fever, started getting better next day. worth it. past study showed pfizer better moderna, NYtimes j&amp;j.

If can‚Äôt follow basic guidelines health safety, don‚Äôt need/should patients. Moderna‚Ä¶ absolutely nothing times except little soreness around injection site. different flu shot, definitely getting months.  would think body sufficiently primed dose 1 2 dose 3 provide many side effects.

Nationally, roughly 1 percent children infected virus end hospitalized, 0.01 percent die, according A.A.P. data. hospitalization death rates declined since last still possible, course, Delta could turn cause severe disease children...But U.K., Delta swept population variant became widespread United States, experts say seen clear evidence variant making children sicker.

Delta causing increase case numbers, means hospitalizations, rate hospitalization still roughly 1%, far currently seen. many times said X walk back say way saying ""we wrong, want come right say it""? 

Yes cases would domestic international travel would still impact.

Also suggestions longer intervals doses increases immunity duration. main thing promotes mutation given time domain simply number infections. infections = viruses = chances mutation. like rolling trillion sided die couple magic numbers - shuffles get, chances land one. took hundreds millions infections india produce delta variant.

The best way reduce chances variants showing reduce number infections world, means getting people vaccinated, worldwide. know, mean relatively speaking. Vaccine efficacy studies countries high relative usage Moderna interesting watch. things correct time. UK high vaccination rate makes sense whatever cases end hospital higher % vaccinated people lower number general since many unvaccinated people. Also 99.99 number accurate amount people vaccinated USA 99.99 fine..though take account gotten sick caught covid. entire picture case u.k. makes sense see lower cases overall higher % vaccinated people since make bulk population pretty much reaction Moderna.

Had done nothing prevent COVID, probably still pandemic - albeit much greater cost terms lives, permanent illness, economic damage.

I'm advocating letting pandemic rage control among unvaccinated; given unvaccinated seem want exactly that, it'll probably happen, means enough people without immunity sustain pandemic another 18 months. mean, wearing grocery store, much good really do?

American lived US many years - need explain US healthcare me.

You‚Äôre making fatal assumption infected person prior immunity ability promote mutations virus someone unvaccinated. bad assumption two counts. first someone vaccinated dramatically less likely infected first place. Spread levels place 100% vaccination different one 10% vaccination. already, ground less fertile mutation happen vaccinating people. Two, key one, vaccinated people indeed get sick, they‚Äôre sick long people unvaccinated. means virus less time find mutations infected person. Think like slot machine. virus gets inside unvaccinated person, virus gets six pulls machine- inside vaccinated person, it‚Äôs one pull. example works well mutations completely random. virus occasionally get lucky, that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs selecting anything make fit, happens gets good pull. It‚Äôs posited level evidence alpha delta variants originated immunocompromised patients multi-month long infections- basically letting virus stay casino night pulling slots. Vaccination inhibits that. 

As mutations general, viruses aren‚Äôt like bacteria. Bacteria living organisms transfer genetic information that‚Äôs beneficial survival amongst multiply own. also survive environment lot longer maintain homeostasis. Viruses can‚Äôt this. virus gains beneficial mutation, it‚Äôs entirely dependent particular virus make inside human cell propagate itself. virus beneficial mutation stays air long, proteins comprising oxidize. infected individual quarantines, virus nowhere go. gets inside body needs latch right cell, caught immune system antigens attach antibodies (something vaccination infection generates lot of) There‚Äôs whole host things go wrong virus even beneficial mutation allows avoid immune system. 

I could go it‚Äôs extraordinarily unlikely virus make mutation makes dramatically virulent immune evasive one fell swoop, think point made. never deficit getting vaccinated immunity within you. always help people. Here's thought. Maybe Pfizer others could donate one dose Africa per dose sold western country? 

Have seen profits they've made?   Valid point, look death worse... 614,856 deaths vs 331.45 = 0.184% death rate vs population (0.01% hospitalization death.

Just recommendation. give doctor call worried it. Yup, bad headline. vaccine 95% effective infection, ""twice likely reinfected"" implies prior infection 90% effective re-infection. 

Delta may change things up, data study pre-Delta. know actually happened first wave, right? ƒåCP ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø Agreed. sounds horrid, locking infected people broken stay-at-home quarantine. free first world countries jailed people. live US quarantine close contact someone got infected. order obeyed said could leave property 2 weeks.

Right now, agency RN area would probably earn around $60-90/hr + $1200 weekly meals &amp; lodging.

Having longterm damage major organs rest life cant recover cant reversed.  buried medical debt preventing pursuing certain dreams it, would cause way mental health issues missing school regular social interaction years like everyone else to. They're alone since boat.

There ways protect things high level protection adherence people, people refuse participate society responsibly politicians forbid protections enforced.. ones forcing one other. choose health first sacrifices make pay long run. apples oranges, tragedies enormous impacts society. Yes can't paralyzed fear also recognize is. 9/11. paralyzed fear, went way overboard reaction surveillance wars. still living impacts overreaction today. There's whole generation Americans never know like meet someone gate coming plane.

People longer trust Americans tragedy well. think already overcome hopelessness despair bridge sell Brooklyn. many people sub complained friends neighbors? lack trust? importantly social connections broken speak. impacts echo another decade ends even end tomorrow. tearing fabric society apart seams. start judging people reason end emergency room now? Seems anti-human. People going make mistakes stupid, life never change, point getting upset it. Inb4nooxygen Infection response depends plethora factors. That's getting vaccinated much reliable. There's likely reason four waves Spanish flu. I'm sure we'll find winter. think we'll reach herd immunity delta surge. like Alabama doctor. hold hands tell late. :-( Nope. Masks haven‚Äôt used anywhere Denmark since June (except select cases). Even back mandated never applied children 12. know study studies ""masks data"" link draws numbers from? Idiocracy, listen think smartest man. worse Idiocracy. information nine hours old. beds full. People vaccinated still getting virus. probably mean logistically speaking US can't give away vaccines distribution, sitting pharmacies such. Vaccines sitting warehouses yet distributed states ones donated. No, one clearly 95% actually means vaccinated people 95% lower risk getting COVID-19 compared control group participants, vaccinated. words, vaccinated people Pfizer clinical trial 20 times less likely control group get COVID-19. 

It nothing ""severe illness/hospitalization/death"". spread misinformation, please.  Huh, mine mild. 12 hours shot mild chills little head ache, back normal 2 days. feel like obvious.

Yes, oppressive government ensure compliance, lock downs waste time involved viable solution. scrolled Police Officer Justin White's memorial post department's page someone wrote ""believe"" COVID-19 vaccinated. 

A lot people leaving thoughts prayers talking gov divisive whatnot, nobody bringing reality team red's messaging covid ignited chaos. 

These people themselves. That's worst part all. children. mean, can't think kids? dad. 

This flat madness. People need reality check, even then, seem help. I'm vaccinated fully committed proponent public health measures, please take question loaded political statement. question, I'm trying educate myself. Given transmissibility delta variant (relatively) high vaccination rate certain locales, conditions promote mutation increased virulence coronavirus? I'm thinking antibiotics foster resistant ""super bugs"" example. get latter example refers overuse unnecessary prescription antibiotics, nobody abusing coronavirus vaccines. also understand alternative leaving defenseless deadly virus. I'm trying think future outcomes. I'm pretty sure are. There's something like 70 80 million people country currently eligible vaccinated. We've always contingent anti-vaxx, course, I've never gotten impression EIGHTY MILLION them. 

I sure significant percentage people either politically brainwashed vaccine particular, unsure safety efficacy short timeline, thought could get away getting shot situation seemed control quite there, simply give crap never worried covid objectively threatening (especially young people, far least-vaccinated cohort). combination thereof.

None makes ""anti-vaxx"" classic sense (the ""vaccines gave kid autism, killed grandma, fucked wife, decreased property value"" sense) I'd like think part, non-die-hards could swayed outreach, incentives (money), dangerous situation general, see right vaccination rates climbing due deteriorating Delta situation. love island?

I feel like that's way possible current situation. Look covid numbers Korea, Vietnam, China, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Sinapore.

*For sake getting banned downplaying dangerous virus is, simply quoting article. longer rare exception, overreaction. Young healthy people definitely risk needing hospitalized unvaccinated get COVID, specifically Delta. 

That's ""scare tactic left""- truth.  Probably much data vaccine pregnant women, legitimate concerns.

In Canada least, took health authorities *forever* recommend pregnant women get vaccinated - biologically plausible serious risks, enough testing pregnant women specifically.

Circulating antibody levels wane time. yes, break cases increase. said, still memory B cells ready ramp production infection happen. vaccine provides protection severe disease. can‚Äôt figure data breakthrough cases vax type? Like, shouldn‚Äôt collecting that? they, telling us? #facepalm Also, higher vaccination rates would lead vaccinated people hospitalized e.g. 80% vaccination rate population 4 times many vaccinated people unvaccinated people population. whole city war zone.

The Israel data include raw figures. worse reaction shingles vaccines received. pretty hardy comes shots, shingles made arm feel like someone hit sledgehammer. Significantly worse COVID jab got.

Neither healthcare workers he‚Äôs mandating them. Houston El Paso likely join well. meetings week approve mask mandates. always strong reactions/side effects vaccines many medications. Local anesthetic work well either. plus side almost never get sick. certainly possible highly unlikely due area getting hit hard precautions took. love science. changes evidence, we're right also right 2020. Ugh two year old go Hospital cancer appointments. I‚Äôm ready know we‚Äôve done protection wise. I‚Äôm going mentally prepare December age group. Exactly. Whenever anyone talks old people die teh virus, small percentage people die, asked go read posts long haul subreddit.

People dealing heart, respiratory, neurological stuff (sometimes three)...some well year virus. hospitalized. impacts mild even asymptomatic cases. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article people antivax wanted wait see dumb deserve death, right?

By playing ""wait see"" game know FDA ALREADY accumulated data issued EUA, yes, dumb.

It's pandemic, likes seen 100 years. something ""wait see"" with. trust people relevant knowledge go get vaccine soon available.

That said, deserve death? That's decide. body COVID-19. feel like Malvern isn‚Äôt britpoor tho lol That‚Äôs what‚Äôs going happen ‚Ä¶. there‚Äôs going lot suffering. US massive population almost 100 million aren‚Äôt vaccinated. Hospitals can‚Äôt handle kind overload. Roflmao. say unvaccinated share Facebook messages vaccine tell everyone around get it.


Good one there.   Dude, know. dozens studies long COVID. we're seeing relatively short term, long term effects potential extremely negative. Hey, same! Texas. didn‚Äôt even ask OB, got it. Granted already second trimester time available March. afterwards asked appointment vaccinated, happy gotten it. drives crazy many providers still giving mixed signals, there‚Äôs clearly high risk pregnant women, plus there‚Äôs evidence antibodies passed baby.  directly Certainly. Since delivered early Feb, got lucky several ways. 

1) allowed us minimize visitors hospital (that overwhelming normal times. ha) 

2) Vaccines rolling even though antivax hot spot, immediate family willing get vaccinated abide rules. 

3) short months vaccine roll delta appearing let questionable friends/family see visit us. 

We back self imposed lock (as much possible anyway). Eldest started school...private school thats requires masks. working, masking. Anyone remotely questionable kept away.

Good luck friend! He‚Äôs snake oil salesman. Textbook bullshit artist Kids die number 30+ years old adults. many children could die florida?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, florida hospital top capacity? sick children would hospital go? Although incidence co-morbidities fairly clustered (technical term follow independence uniqueness principal).

It completely possible two obese parents smoke grandparent smokes COPD. Given priors much likely whole adult portion gets killed disabled COVID. 

Having one obese parent increases chance one obese weight. unlike dice rolls rolling 6 affect next roll. Brah we're trying play DLCs. already next version.  ‚ÄúHey look dummy‚Ä¶ predicted things going get bad convinced leaders take action, didn‚Äôt get bad said could‚Äù

Most US ""felt"" like almost normal couple months ago, we're backpedaling thanks unvaccinated. nothing HIPAA. HIPAA actually supposed fix problems setting standards distribution health data. mostly lack strong national state health authorities poor collection practices county health organizations. HIPAA allows distribution anonymized data health insurance companies, providers, health data clearinghouses.

However lot companies universities consider data proprietary tend sell rather distribute it. Patients request health records, stuff like statistics anonymized data belongs hospital/insurance company. Check Aaron Collins YouTube. puts link master doc suppliers N95s, KN95s lot KF94s video descriptions. recommend getting KF94s mask fitter cheaper. Otherwise, you‚Äôre still set N95s, check Grainger, Fastenal, and/or Moldex suppliers (on website). logic, won‚Äôt believe anything it‚Äôs multiple platforms.

The flu viral champion fast mutation immune evasion. There's reason tons pandemic preparation pre-2020 focused possibility pandemic flu there's reason flu shot one people need annually.

I'm hoping increase people getting flu shots comes pandemic (at least US flu shot uptake seriously atrocious). layman, yes. scientist, no. discussed many times /r/COVID19. simple seems. Sadly 99% stuff read layman takes/headlines.

To fair, Abbott DeSantis _could_ make offer step exchange federal help something along lines that's law. likely get help without so. I'd 100% system like though. Remember hitting cities like New York LA kept hearing rural America say ""not problem?""

That mentality never left, *their* problem 'mine', even neighbors dropping like flies

It's bizarre really. dead, everything great /s Even include 1 dose + natural immunity numbers, probably around 70% protected.

30% population unvaccinated still lot people, almost 100 million people. that's lot bodies spread through. 

On top that, people tend hang like minded people. anti-vaxxers likely hang anti-vaxxers. covid gets groups, gonna spread like wild fire Well question mind set anyone would travel Florida middle summer ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è No. One unavoidable, potentially easily avoidable, except people like make pandemic take 12x longer should, patience much entitlement.

I overnight observation last week woman room section morning going get vacine ""who knows toxic things it""- also woman; ""I wait get smoke"" ... ask stupid question? simply understand consistently 100k new cases per day. minimum 10% country already infected half country FULLY vaccinated. Beyond that, breakthrough cases still pretty rare, least knowledge much evidence re-infections. somebody help understand still many daily new cases? Also, overweight airborne communicable disease, right? tell brother-in-law, critical care pulmonologist, ordered intubation 32 year old last Tuesday. patient dead now. He's arguing death rates reach insignificant levels due vaccines/catching it, covid defacto new influenza medical journals saying heard immunity never achieved. death rate Harris county 5 7 day average far cry seeing average 20s, 30s 40s, likely deaths unvaccinated people. wish add Florida. beaches packed many state plates mostly NY, NJ, MA.

Fortunately, actually added protection breastmilk get vaxxed delivery. working now.

[Biden administration developing plan require almost foreign visitors still early phases developing plan announcement imminent. reliable source, state telling people exposed, test day 3-5 (Indiana) people dont time even think read scientific papers vaccine efficacy. need ridicule it.

Kind shitty state government. company would let go long ago loss money. save half so‚Ä¶ situation would want one. make decision withdraw enrollment oldest child first grade they‚Äôre mandating masks second grade up. even then, actual compliance rate going total shit we‚Äôre red state one highest number cases.

üëÄ oh my... Well probably dealing new surge people vaccinated. What? vaccines specifically given pregnant women every time. wife gotted TDAP shot every pregnancy part typical treatment. CDC recommends getting TDAP flu vaccine every  make medical decisions based thinking company produces medicine vaccine. make based evidence need benefit. evidence collected, decision made. People say often realize many different versions familiar vaccines many new too. 

We're familiar main covid19 vaccines, Pfizer, Moderna, AZ, J&amp;J. multiple competing offerings almost traditional vaccines. Makes sense right, think they're still using vaccines invented color TV?

For example versions DPaT vaccine around since 1940s, today lot kids get Quadracel first approved 2015. first MMR vaccine approved 1960s, ProQuad, recent MMRV shot get local pediatrician's office, approved 2005. Nimenrix common meningitis vaccine first released 2012. first HepB vaccine released 1981, modern version folks get (Nimenrix) approved 2017.

If people think they're getting exact vaccine grandparents got, they're wrong. vaccines get pharmacy doctor's office recent inventions. good thing safer far refined terms antigens (now important ones instead ""we know important include all"" mentality existed before). Kids today get 3-4x jabs did, immune systems get exposed 1/30th many unique antigens.

Since vaccines pretty new, I'd bet safety profile covid vaccines better understood damn near anything market. Especially rare vaccines like meningitis (in US, required students living college dorms). covid shots given literally billions people side effect surveillance anal caught 1/1.2 million blood clotting issue paused delivery entire nation. many people gotten Nimerix since launched 2012, probably 1/100th many. Yet nobody complains mandatory meningitis vaccination. arguing we're experiencing fourth wave now? think that's clearly false, many sources reporting fourth wave point. Gottlieb wrong. let face-saving impulse blind reality... That's we're mess, folks doubling wrong. He's admitting anything. allows voters see thing. fed cleans up, he's still Texas bro gets kiss Trump rump. long keeps TX anything even suggested D.C. own, he's hero. Federal government get way progress Florida. fauci them! They‚Äôve also found antibodies breastmilk

We've told well wife plan breastfeed understand baby receive antibodies whether gets vaccinated birth. I'm arguing you. commenting sliding narrative others sub. hope y'all get good news soon, wife son healthy I'll teaching school mandates masks, vast majority students staff cloth masks. Furthermore, kids ages 3-6. barely wear correctly. I'll double masking surgical mask KN95 every day, I'm sure much protect there's outbreak everyone else's masks essentially useless. I'm new hire can't come tell everyone they're wrong, especially protocols worked last year pre-Delta. I'm really worried. still run pregnant women

I visited handful friends. One group knew coming anyone else. fully vaccinated quarantined arrived. Chatting made realize Floridians dont care following rules. always business usual there. Theres major events like concerts live DJ performances parties weekly. Ive seen tons posts packed venues. Nobody wearing masks crammed tightly building. 

One night visited best friend since high school. got chat smoking fat bowl (she bought new piece visit) said perfectly. ""Florida dont give fuck Covid"". frame mind Florida hit mega hard variant. Theres huge number unvaccinated people there. younger crowd partying like 1999 mixing massive older retired population. recipe disaster. Even new variant, numbers skyrocketing, still dont care.

**‚ÄòWorrying‚Äô numbers pregnant women intensive care Covid**

Well depends one considers 'worrying"". 66 thousands likely unvaccinated. So, yes, worrying worried?

**Dozens Texas hospitals ICU beds COVID-19 cases overwhelm state's capacity**

Sounds scary it? TFA says 14% people COVID patients. minimize COVID that's issue. must additional capacity begin with. 

I could go on. make sound like sudden change. mention increase occurrences upward trend 10-15 years now.

So logic canceled outdoor events festivals etc long ago.

But reality chances getting lyme disease much much lower compared catching covid indoors. CDC recommendations changed around April 23rd, makes sense given time line. 

I murky language time frame well got vaxxed anyway. thankful did. going administer shots? It‚Äôs problem again.

You 300 million doses, give many shots day. general population getting vaccinated important random Redditor disagrees!

/s Yeah what's interesting they'll say long covid data worry breath say know long term side effects vaccine. feel like everyone argues edge cases glaring fact vaccine incredible job preventing death hospitalization. Another weekly gain U.S. prefer ‚Äòwe‚Äôre pregnant‚Äô type language.

Pfizer said it‚Äôs highly likely people need booster 6-12 month range, approaching nine month mark first elderly recipients, nothing. part isn‚Äôt factual? 

Anxiously awaiting rebuttal‚Ä¶ let get straight...

The governor asking help COVID killing people Texas, yet refuses lift ban mask mandates?

Do right? stuck infinite looping nightmare? Astrazeneca plus mrna vaccine actually seems best combo all. don‚Äôt know people straight make shit lie things. tests positive refuse let her? ask hospital policy?

It's anecdotal, hospital may different, hospital would allow us together regardless results. US, Florida. baby, got tested(luckily negative). thought positive test would kick out, nurses told different. said tests safety. know husband, wife, baby coming home together. make lot sense separate couple days hospital. wanted know much protective equipment needed keep safe. 

I'm sure hospitals different rules, worth asking together. rough situation you. Hope stay healthy. Good luck. Actually tested babies mothers vaccinated antibodies. They‚Äôve also found antibodies breastmilk I‚Äôm directing you, I‚Äôm starting really hate statement, ‚Äúit‚Äôs proven yet‚Äù.

I vaccinated early third trimester holding healthy, happy almost 4 month old right now. peace mind gave well worth it, knowing may protective antibodies awhile incredibly comforting given Delta.  Same. Ontario resident, due early November. Got first vax May second end June. Really hoping DoFo right thing(s) prevent fourth wave here.

There's evidence substantial waning protection serious disease. would expected see sterilizing immunity fade time, protection serious disease remain. Nah, Plato cave boi. Socrates sent prank. 99.99% people fully vaccinated COVID breakthrough case resulting hospitalization death.

Vaccines work highly effective hospitalization death, that's stupid statistic. people exposed COVID, tell anything well vaccines actually do. That's look vaccines terms efficacy (comparing vaccinated vs unvaccinated population). absolutely working. genetic aspect Crohn's, think Covid root cause it. could catalyst caused immune system act though. I've Crohn's 20 years now, unfortunately somewhat common family - terrible disease, thoughts go poor girl. fail see why. Pregnant women choosing get vaccine either doctor told want risk hurting child. putting child first safety. Trying beat virus like trying hold shit. two couples family trying conceive right now, none vaccinated they're worried effects fertility. 12 year-old best friend masked kids dropped middle school morning. I'm hearing similar stuff friends high schooler texting me. Brevard county, Florida 24% positivity rate. could end anything badly?  holding anymore. makes wonder, Covid kill narcissists higher rate people without high rate narcissism? Like, refuse care community safety taken gene pool? know probably make complete sense, evolutionary biologist would rip apart.

Long story short, nurse ringing Dr. Scholls foot supports administering medicine people.  US? No. places centralized databases general got little CDC cards told us lot vaccines in. super easy fake. People selling fake cards online months. Long COVID real, seriously debilitating.

So far Covid claimed 10 lives FL 0 17 age range. Take 10 kids gun nothing changes. Obfuscate across entire state even  don‚Äôt really think are. Reports England, Scotland, Singapore, Canada Chile rather consistent.

I think confusing mention deaths, cite severe infections, cite symptomatic infections, cite asymptomatic infections completely. 

Israel outlier, it‚Äôs really bad study report discredited less, leaving ~60% one make sense given Israel vaccinated heavily two months anyone else.

This report rather new cause Moderna hasn‚Äôt used much Pfizer, AZ various Chinese vaccines‚Ä¶ less data it. I'm definitely sympathetic fact lasting impact children coming years. collective global trauma we've endured, unless one assholes still running around pretending covid exist.

But children grow learn parents could keep others safe. parent want? vaccinated hospitalized. FAR late. fucking late, kids school month September god damn late. fuck MONTHS. Public Health Policy slow, 21st century process. Thank god COVID deadly diseases. Yet. noted children aged 0-11 *extremely* low risk hospitalization death.

She‚Äôs unvaccinated OB said wasn‚Äôt good baby. family remains unvaccinated small town doctors keep telling ‚Äúit‚Äôs unsafe. many unknowns.‚Äù it‚Äôs frustrating thing witness. Wife telling vaccinated. See that‚Äôs problem. don‚Äôt care antivax morons filling hospitals? suppose precognition chance need use hospital non Covid reason? guess don‚Äôt care antivax idiots greatly increasing chances new variants may beat vaccine? Don‚Äôt know old people weak immune systems may susceptible even though got shots? well actively read covid daily. probably spend anywhere 2-4 hours day

What led become obsessed covid? assume virologist someone related field? point, exactly? article TX commenting GA commented situation NY different. 232 deaths past two days, endorsed enabled frontrunner 2024 presidential nominee major US political party. get not-believe science feel like it, ask government fancy science-machines realize people dying fuck-up. 

It's helluva lot cheaper get people wear mask ventilator. Best luck. Depending situation covid like next May, could suggest rapid tests everyone. relatively cheap professional show perform test everyone. results person back within 15 mins. Vaccines work.

Desantis hire Todd Howard...why go 4 go 16 times details republican loves state hate governor position always would take whichever vaccine syringe front me, ended Pfizer myself. I‚Äôm increasingly glad older family members (mom aunts/uncles) ended Moderna.  Anyone know good disposable masks uncomfortable buy online? Don‚Äôt like wearing cloth masks finally went box ones liked. super high risk, Alpha would probably fine. Delta much contagious.

You need try convince sister. could end dead.

Latest study shown Moderna (100mg dosage) effective vaccine, even Pfizer (30 mg Articles like clearly politically motivated, little accuracy situation actual development use covid vaccines part region.

We've abused used west sorts bullcrap last 100 years.

Edit: unaware, [if pregnant, receive COVID-19 Interesting, thanks info.  New England true. However, also true parents access miracle vaccine close eliminates risk death. 

There always anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately, point must become responsibility protect    IMO every healthcare professional refuses get vaccinated ineligible work healthcare throughout country. clearly lack intelligence empathy needed competent healthcare professional.  least, televise scene la 'A Good Men' forces Desantis ""ask nicely"" nothing politics, lol, commenting ""brown people"" (such disgusting vulgarity), probably think everyone underdeveloped countries Caucasians everyone developed countries are.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   We're much better treating people last year. think issue children dying, large number children getting long covid. Estimates range 2-15% lingering symptoms months.

Remember childhood diseases cause drop dead 30 years later? COVID that? know. novel virus. Erroring side caution always better. 6 months till vaccine 5 year olds come big deal big scheme things. 1-2% kids condition kill years later worrysome. even ""killing them"". Look Shingles, herpes. 

All additional 3-4 months social life lifespan.

Now get ideal. pandemic. Shit happens. Tomorrow asteroid, volcano whatever.

When california wildfires made AQI 400+ kids kept indoors. Sometimes inconvenient thing stave deadly.  also run issue many homeschool groups anti-vax anti-health protocols? One local ones monthly indoor potlucks last year‚Äîno masks!

Also‚Äîcongrats new baby! Washington (state) Oregon high vaccination rate also surging right -- reached peak COVID likely go beyond previous peaks. hospitalization rates immediately shown Google know going angle, higher lower COVID vaccination rates seem make huge difference terms case numbers. Iceland instance 90% adult vaccination (and \~80% total vaccination) they're record peak COVID infections right -- \~1/5th 1/8th many hospitalizations last time peaked. Same, always started September there, keep mind atleast kid 80's schools AC one biggest reasons. Headlights start ‚ÄúFlorida Man Ron Desantis‚Ä¶‚Äù don‚Äôt doubt all. Yea can‚Äôt seem say etc can‚Äôt even say type rn is. Like said she‚Äôs oncology nurse broke hippa States report numbers **to** CDC. 

They don‚Äôt get CDC. Yes. Preventing towns cities protecting citizens harsh.  work 5 star hotel it‚Äôs $300 night. nurses staying 2-3 months straight. looking ( mods won‚Äôt let post link unfortunately) one article really broke down. Basically kids young vaccinated driving force behind infections giving fully vaccinated adults. know vaccine effective delta even fully vaccinated asymptotic adults spread vaccinated. getting critically ill still 97% effective preventing death. reason many infections vaccinated adults population mostly vaccinated, default people, break infections. 10 people vaccinated one population 100 another, 1 person get first 10 get percentage. 

I hope makes sense happy try answer questions relayed info unclear way. course implore research info! I'm really interested see Pfizer Delta Canada, prolonged second dose. 

Hopefully better results Israel / USA doses stick 21 day regiment. weekend sickness death Mississippi, 6,912 residents tested positive COVID-19 28 people reported died coronavirus.

Read here:  kicker unvaccinated child 12 actually taller larger 12 child. Kids grow different rates. money ridiculous. married settled I'd grabbing travel jobs well. Certainly so. healthcare provider serves immunocompromised patients. also wanted antibodies protect baby. Stupid DeSatan else force DeSantis reasonable? can‚Äôt require masks, can‚Äôt require vaccines, need support feds people dying. sucks, make change backward policies? blows mind many I‚Äôm similar spot you. kids homeschooled since March 2020. baby June 2020 don‚Äôt energy time effective teacher home. need interaction kids outside other. hate that. I'm state handling well myself. Read post recently said virus people dying become way life, like guns/mass shootings things. People going back normal acting like okay. many concerned. asked OB got (mostly wanted know needed lie pregnant not) started describing placentas covid patients. dude trenches saw first hand covid otherwise healthy pregnancy. would really hope OB's seeing similar things, they'd front patients risks covid rather focusing unknown vaccine. Thank you! time vaccination could've mitigated spread first started dealing alpha, even goal, goal dying. 'we' sat hands gotten everyone vaccinated likely would've reduced ability mutate delta higher viral load. wish messaging would straightforward, realize crappy politicization virus puts everyone tough spot. (I know kind descriptions, want trigger bots). ACOG professional organization board certified obstetricians gynecologists. SMFM professional organization obstetricians specialize high risk pregnancies. Ask obgyn confirm credible sources information field. federal government push $3.5 trillion spending package. 

If will, could absolutely afford $250 million give every kid 5 N95s $500 million buy $150 air purifier classroom.  Lol, you‚Äôre hysterical. Parent commenter vaccinated. persisted 18+ months now. I‚Äôm sure much would desire to, can‚Äôt stay homes post ‚Äú#StayHome‚Äù forever. 

For vaccinated people, it‚Äôs glorified cold receive it, barring exceptionally rare circumstances. Everyone ample time vaccinated (excepting kids disease effect largely negligible, 300-something deaths 2020); vaccinated, it‚Äôs personal choice. everyone can, likely desires, putting lives hold people. shows last year's lockdowns unnecessary. 

More cases yet fewer deaths. 

If want minimize chance catching COVID, get vaccinated. vaccinated worried, stay home. Exercise choice also embrace consequences choice. Huh? study literally summarizes with‚Ä¶

‚ÄúOur data show anti-disease vaccines prevent transmission create conditions promote emergence pathogen strains cause severe disease unvaccinated Florida: want hear blip covid Feds!

Also Florida: Requesting ventilators Feds. School started north part. go ahead make dumb comments, guess.  guess way wrote confusing. thought obvious meant, ""Yes, fire surgeons wash hands."" Guess DeSantis ‚Äústanding Biden‚Äôs way‚Äù 6 days needing help. Milk lasts longer aged. Wait, remember back day people saying federal governments responsibility provide stuff. Something hospitals responsible ready, states needing fend themselves. Looks like Florida fend here. ""Let breathe cake."" PRN friend CO working TX last year half, finishes paying loans December. aren‚Äôt helping all. sub loves doom. know getting downvoted bit. 100% correct reason.

Biden really stretching constitutional abilities far right now, giving credit that. He's can. However, sometimes even best solutions within reach. data Israel clearly show 3rd dose offer strong benefits reducing deaths end month.  Good start. Many parents won‚Äôt vaccinating kids though. nursing sub several examples people intubated saying last words it‚Äôs hoax. It‚Äôs sad.  commented saw post - yes! husband's aunt lunch lady elementary school refuses get vaccinated. co-worker quit last year want wear mask. Masks optional year.... I'm worried.  still would be. Keeping smaller kids attention happening zoom entire day. Sorry think otherwise report 166 cases school district 41,000 students. 

Georgia state 10.6 million population 108k active coronavirus cases.  educational system whole trash. Get vaccines people end ! Thanks. Like username fyi Obstruction nothing. give religious exemptions. major religion even opposes vaccines? guess depends risk profile COVID. you‚Äôre stay home mom homeschooled kids would imagine it‚Äôs much easier justify getting vaccine pregnancy. you‚Äôre working hospital grocery store, one day high fever got preferable two weeks severe flu-like symptoms (or worse).

It sounds like it‚Äôs easy decision mothers either way‚Äîit‚Äôs like trolley problem where, paradoxically, taking action intentionally produce lesser harm hard nothing passively incur greater harm. I‚Äôm confused point is‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs winter many school districts can‚Äôt even afford new supplies want n95 masks ventilation devices? feasible signed kids Moderna Kid's trial way back April still called schedule first appointment yet. confirmation phone call email 2 weeks ago. Mississippi late. time start shutting everything now.  wonder would happen football stadiums implemented vaccination requirement attend. agree this. sadly, people know unwilling vaccinate teachers 20s. believe Facebook hype infertility. Sad they're ones educating next generation. Er...no.

Independent SAGE catastrophic scenarios following latest reopenings vocally opposed it. Yet Johnson ignored advice. I've seen much push back numbers. They're fake, really RSV corona hurting children, even hospitalized mean going die (?!), nothing bad happened me. exhausting, like swatting flies manure pile. percentage teachers unvaccinated? may moot point already vaxed. companies testing lower doses kids. current dosage might high kids.  husband's aunt cafeteria worker prepares food entire elementary building - get vaccinated. Anyone responsible care children needs vaccinated. He's literally pulling funding schools dare make kids wear masks greatest resurgence pandemic date. analogy, covering blood dangling water.

School compulsory case forgot. bad, misread comment way chain. saying clearly number uninfected (or rather potentially infectable people) higher math would indicate.

i catch conservative estimation say whatever number come still lot bodies go through, even though real answer potentially higher. son WAVA (K12 Stride) - well designed online program. free live WA state. thrived past 2 years ahead ELA math. entered brick mortar, behind. online options failed approaches. Many states option available WA does. Search free online public school state.  Well, holds that‚Äôs little bit silver lining mess.

At point I‚Äôll take tiny bit hopeful news get so‚Ä¶ reading lot pregnant people undecided get impacts pregnancy still largely unknown, understandable. see 3400 cases Mississippi 7000 Broward defying governor mask mandate. passed board 1 vote.  Pediatric ICUs full RSV cases, mostly COVID. policies frozen pole. He's looking it, knows dumb idea, anyways, asks help. I‚Äôm CT! post removed cannot verify reliable source.

WTF yes do. save half, die ventilators die ventilators. [excellent, facility late ‚Äô80s, boneheaded prime minister caught Thatcher/Reagan bug sold private interests. Wholly crap...reading comprehension Batman. statement context means variants even whole US vaccinates...because need vaccinate whole world. See next sentence? mean vaccines created variant. No, really good question hope revisited one day. invaded two countries nothing it, spend 20 years trillions $ (but fuck kids can't afford lunch), surrendering great deal civil liberties way none us could fully grasp time terrorist/funding third country shielded. questions need asked answered that. 

One week now:

'illegal immigrants posing healthcare workers spreading covid throughout state. identify them, Healthcare workers longer wear masks.' hitting new wave, vaccinated unvaccinated getting sick, variants still coming; letting eviction moratorium work benefits expire?


It doesn‚Äôt seem yet, acting is. Maybe import masks? Yup you‚Äôre right. sure number came from, seems recent numbers could find state released are:

Friday, Aug. 6: 21,500
Saturday Aug. 7: 19,567
Sunday, Aug. 8: 15,319
3-day average: 18,795

So let‚Äôs take average divided population that‚Äôs .086% state testing positive new cases one day. rates continue level (with schools opening next week two they‚Äôll likely go even more) 30 day period live state Florida 2.57% chance testing positive. 

Meanwhile governor busy trying pull funding school districts want impose mask mandates. Made sweeter dingus Twitter asking BBC staying silent protest outside HQ... hospitals get full, stop offering expensive elective procedures would otherwise bring plenty money. late. original ""flatten curve"" became ""and one asymptomatic case many!"" shit. hear steel drums Maybe varies state? teacher MN, I've never asked vaccine status. Although many districts offered give hep (I think hep b?) vaccine hiring. Honestly enough people think teachers kids :(

I think less think care. School government funded daycare. People want interrupted. care well-being people involved it, want service disrupted. Today 3488, highest entire pandemic. We're 34 hospitalizations away topping Jan 4th highest reported hospitalizations 1444. mean, it‚Äôs not, especially deadly pandemic. die, that‚Äôs it. can‚Äôt kids. You‚Äôre putting rest family, unborn child, general public risk tiny possibility miscarriage, bad case Covid thing slew issues.

Even miscarriage, tragic is, can‚Äôt get pregnant again‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs still better dead. also doesn‚Äôt mean never children again- adoption, surrogacy, etc. always possible. still another child even last shot pregnancy. call guy gun nut. crazy. I'd consider somewhat gun nut want associated real crazy mass murderers. entire teachers' union strike put position danger could prevented this‚Ä¶somehow‚Ä¶  Yep, hardcore conservative teachers' unions! Cool. guess everything A-OK then!

Fool ‚Ä¶ Exactly hoping hear. Thank you! I‚Äôm Georgia school started days ago, way they‚Äôre handling school bad. aren‚Äôt offering digital learning, aren‚Äôt social distancing (they‚Äôve packing us together shoulder shoulder buses classrooms), teachers don‚Äôt even wear masks right. It‚Äôs almost laughable they‚Äôre acting like covid never happened. cases start rolling know they‚Äôll send us right back digital. 

I wonder long take covid over, way handled feels like last years. miss able touch things without anxiety covid. Agreed. Isn‚Äôt part ‚Äúsocial contract‚Äù help other‚Ä¶? You‚Äôll fine.. Yes, lot conflicting studies Pfizer efficacy Delta. Israel study like 39% something like that. We're waiting more/bigger/better studies publish hone precision, guess. feel socially distance.. Florida right dangerous place nearly 1 100 people covid WTF getting vaccine help health save life ""selfish""? Triage works, right also collapses.

You triage x patients per day. start seeing 2x patients multiple days row, going fall behind. point, project management tricks process patients faster reducing triage checklist, add second triage team on.

I'm thinking analogy would protest turns riot. Eventually, one side retreat, outnumbered badly cannot control situation.

I said past family friends would want involved logistics staffing emergency room. pre-covid. expensive ER doctors hanging around people dying lobby off...  school hit might Covid. generally think coughing throat/lung issues, gas acid reflux. also vaccinated CDC came new guidance P-Town. know, know someone FDA working thats answer gave me. Id love see got ""information"". *sell* health care related information? *America?* *For profit?!* 

Shocked, say. Shocked. Southern schools start earlier, usually. way long time That's great idea. wife also due October. hope honor type request. FL another country would travel ban still catch Covid breakthrough infection vaccinated. addition, (albeit slight) increased chance premature birth miscarriage pregnant women infected Covid. We're talking couple percent, even scary mother. vaccines available cheaply massively produced, ineffective, next worthless vaccines based papers rarely ever peer reviewed, almost never published international journals

\-First Vaccines prevented getting covid, ""breakthrough cases"" supposedly rare

\-Then vaccines prevented hospitalizations

\-Now vaccines prevent serious illness (Well half serious illness Israel among fully vaccinated).

&amp;#x200B;

I got vaccine clear works time, unvaccinated people still likely get covid especially get serious illness, I'm really worried long term efficacy especially since Israel world's first vaccination drive 3 week spacing unlike UK. Herd immunity seems like pipedream. Thankfully governor wants protect kids from‚Ä¶. Masks? Greg Abbott's brilliant solution is... *checks notes*... hiring healthcare workers states? Sure, Greg.   long tern risk microplastics. Also long term risks gases fume plastic. plastic packaging plastic forks.

There greater zero chance get smacked meteor able reply message. worth trying hide meteors deep caverns radon get instead. California hiding caves even worse earthquake collapse threat.

South Korea Taiwan used mostly contact tracing widespread testing keep cases isolated without locking down, New Zealand Western cultural values government power level similar lockdowns happened Europe, China high government power level heavy lockdown. one thing common responded early decisively. true examples either, pretty much every country think responded early well - hell even Germany great first wave, mistakes fall destroyed them. People want admit great number 200 countries reason things bad really made wrong decisions beginning, they've paying price ever since. Urban/academic setting, local choices it. bounced back leaving seeing really better elsewhere.

Even CDC power order mass quarantine (which, may may have), administration political it, enforcing would near impossible. Half counties country would tell go jump lake (""Freedom!""), understaffed, overworked, local cops time ability enforce it, without getting shot thrown street, half governors country enforce quarantine, even disease 50% kill rate. too! Good luck keep kiddos safe already is. hurts heart hear that. baby due October want able rely medical staff protect him. selfish people. vaccines also portable, important poor countries. It‚Äôs daycare center people. That's definitely good point consider, thanks mentioning hope case. might hard track fest attracts people country.  Yesterday IL reported highest case count since Jan year. saying direct result Lollapalooza, something note.  see one side  curtain assume side looks  glamorous. DeSantis murderer new nickname. vacation Florida planned October parents, husband (we vaccinated) 11.5 month daughter. 14 months planning go. I‚Äôm anxious going don‚Äôt want daughter get sick. plan flying btw. need unbiased advice. Thanks.  Please remember DeSantis speak Floridians. He's playing dangerous popularity game real people hurt it. Yes, need better job making sure people information. 

The ACOG recommends vaccination 
pregnant lactating women.

[link recommends vaccination please, anyone doctors advising otherwise following guidelines standard care. That's I'm doing. tried explain I'm citing say problem. I'm citing show people OP talking worried about.

I'm saying ""look facts Fox."" I'm saying: concerned people read Fox believe this. claim **they** concerned about, article fact check it, ineffective rebuttal concerned reader Fox. ""I think standpoint public, really matter,"" Offit said. ""It's given half American population. 300 million doses there. far experimental. tremendous safety efficacy portfolio vaccines -- mean, licensed products now.""

Bingo. Anyone still doubts really paying attention. Trump can't real authority anymore. DeSantis probably still could.

The thing is, they've made career-defining point *won't*   people deny literal dying breath Covid real despite dying Covid, death kids change thing.

I'm mindset stop wasting bed space resources idiots. Makes sense. It‚Äôs odd I‚Äôm looking individual states reported NY times don‚Äôt see huge jumps would account increase. I‚Äôd assume data dump, don‚Äôt see one. could missing it! seeing demons goes sleep probably.

He middle shit storm lose. vaccinated live life. past weekend went 2 crowed events without hesitation wearing mask. also fully vax'd. concerned, wear mask safe. Probably risk thr drive wherever plan going It‚Äôs four days school district six schools already sending notices Covid exposure campuses! Thanks added original post. parents hbp. dad took AZ sore muscles mom took Sinovac (as per doctors recommendation much worse commodities) zero side-effects. Also, I‚Äôm sure guidance changed since exposed work month ago HR department told CDC guidelines didn‚Äôt test quarantine since vaccinated. I‚Äôm sure lot breakthrough cases really mild we‚Äôre catching vaccinated people basically told rules don‚Äôt apply them. Absolutely. many friends torn do. know mask mandate CDC Americans. Social distancing. think absence really much effect currently.

smh Access healthcare preventable disease prioritized peoples' medical needs idiots choose get vaccinated. I'm talking kids 12 Covid, adults got vaccinated still got sick, adults unable vaccinated health reason. I'm talking people chance get free, efficacious vaccine still opted roll dice. We're 18 months USA, effective vaccines widely available since March-April places here... none new anymore. Eligible people chance get it. point need consequences getting putting whole d-mn community risk, we'll dealing mask/distancing/mutations junk forever. months data

That absolutely quick judgement call... LOL longer pandemic People asking questions refuse answer. aren‚Äôt insults. Yes do. makes sense actions state leaders affects states. actions affect country too. same. I‚Äôve never seen many parents eager turn kid‚Äôs lives game Russian Roulette ‚Äúright‚Äù send vulnerable, unvaccinated, unmasked littles classroom full non-distanced kids raging pandemic. They've ranting months unmaking kids in/on county FB pages - I‚Äôm floored all.

I'm wondering many suddenly start shouting county protected children unfortunately begin get ill. \*will\* get ill... trying wait full approval 15 year old. (All family 18 vaxxed). felt better parent. delta changed things area. 

So agree believe see uptick full approval. ‚ÄúI could stand middle I-4 shoot someone wouldn‚Äôt lose voters‚Äù ""Out migrants encountered Southern border US Customs Border Protection January June,¬†64% removed¬†from US health order.""

Data seems back claim. lot removed health order. 

Difficult get great intel something happening. find someone unconscious, may way get consent. cases, understanding reasonable actions considered consented unless noted (a DNR tattooed chest example). happens next year another variant sends case counts up? wish understood endgame got pregnant February, vaccines first becoming available. OB said ""*we know lot this, know employer allow work home. can't guarantee exposed. think get vaccine.""* trust got 1st vaccine 8 weeks 2nd 12 weeks. 

You would believe amount hate got choosing get vaccine.

You also believe amount unmasked, unvaccinated people see nothing wrong coming breathing me, clearly pregnant woman.

People never learn. tying people injecting them

That's want believe. wording congruent that. Ironically they're crying wanting controlled fact controlled. vaccine children 12 though. heard $10,000-15,000 week depending skills. 235x40 $9,400 right range. Oh yeah sure, think I'm becoming programmed view things rather pessimistically point. months ago assuming another surge question. 

At point I'm keeping eye numbers, eye variants. personally masking, waiting information booster shots avoiding medium large gatherings regardless vaccination. hopefully taking simple reductions help ensure last surge.

Basically prepare worst, hope best. think we're becoming experts dealing stepping completely unknown future point. able make vaccine appointment California person aged 12-15 since mid May. actually quite studies show vaccines safe pregnant women. studied 35,700 vaccinated pregnant women, rate complications normal rate complications unvaccinated pregnancies.
There also smaller studies found - vaccines safe pregnant women babies.

Covid, hand, risky pregnant women babies. reported pregnant women Covid 22 times likely die pregnant women without Covid (95% confidence interval 2.88-172), way higher previous estimate doubling mortality risk. also five fold higher risk ICU admission, double risk preterm birth, triple risk severe infections, five fold risk neonatal complications. bright side, asymptomatically infected women (around 40% infections) higher morbidity risk deaths/ICU admissions, babies born positive (roughly 20% get infected womb) tend mild cases. everyone‚Äôs situation unique, weighing DVC points health disease avoidance, I‚Äôd ask sit really think it. survive w DVC points 100% time. saying don‚Äôt go, don‚Äôt go might lose imaginary marketing points. tried said no. asked could explain biological reason purely administrative. purely administrative.

Mandating K-12 vaccines would undoubtedly force schools close due resignations. agree call all, trying keep schools open. parents CA Germany? vaccinated? parents early 70s worry since got vaccinated. I'm worried young kids. MASKS! MAH FREDUMS! WoM take reports states data dumps put day shoulda reported - lack information evenly split it. 

For example, last week Sun-Tues, FL reported 51k cases 3 days data dump. WoM added ~17k day sun/mon/tues.  

I sure NYTimes does, might report total day came in. last Tuesday, might dumped 51k FL Tuesday, sun/mon FL 0.

I also know vulnerable groups vaccinated many new hospitalizations? cases rising highly vaccinated countries like Chile Seychelles (without corresponding spike hospitalizations deaths), quick point Chinese vaccine ineffective.

I think could due dosage difference: Moderna 100mg, Pfizer 30mg. difference two mRNA fairly disgusting. I'm super far left wishing Republican voters, truthfully ignorant propagandized regular folk, die disgusting. many upvotes even disgusting. guess one bright side vaccinated friend got covid full symptoms knew stay home...and gave young get vaccine kids unfortunately. thinking Asa‚Äôs ‚Äúregret‚Äù would fix things. agree unprofessional perhaps nurse treated adverse reactions she‚Äôs afraid. doesn‚Äôt give right pass fear others we‚Äôre afraid.  ridiculous. feel sorry kids teachers hospital workers. gonna overrule dumbasses, blame bad info spreaders make feel consequences? literally sacrificing children. wish federal government would something governor live is, shall say gently, good job.  children get vaccinated it‚Äôs free point imo. Can‚Äôt waste several years like this. Using total vaccinated counting hospitalizations deathsto downplay number breakthrough cases irrelevant everyone vaccinated testing positive.  Exactly. problem that, often not, people get severe cases go it, ""covid big deal"" mentality reinforced even worse. think compare covid numbers respiratory viruses, covid necessarily replacing admissions, possibly adding them. 

But right pretty weird, RSV also up, stressing hospitals would normal summer. definitely concerning hospital systems running peds ICU beds. herd immunity Delta. 

If vaccinated people still get minor, asymptomatic infections spread virus, keep circulating even everyone vaccinated. 

Plus, COVID-19 zoonotic, jumps species easily. North America, cats, ferrets, deer reservoirs COVID-19. 

This disease us forever. Best case scenario everyone gets annual booster shot keeps check. Yup. much complicated zero-sum game. chance in-silico binding assays usually done without glycosylation factor.


Also, almost always ACE2 vs Spike, ignore Siglec factors.


In addition these, ACE2 seems behave different induced IFN. think study consider factor, either. sad southern states giving people northern states heads what's coming, idiots still get vaccinated. wondering. seems odd. So, two senators admitting currently legal mandate vaccination, right? Otherwise, need bill make illegal.

Also, seems bit odd aim health care providers. like ever going inject will. wait till classes go back full. latest deflection ""illegals bringing state"" I'm afraid another massive sci comm mistake made. rationale recovered unvaccinated people get vaccinated thus far vaccine immunity lasts longer 6-8 months natural infection. latest data suggest vaccine immunity starts dropping precipitously intervals, though severe outcome protection still there. vocal number vaccine mandate passport opponents using natural immunity soapbox, need start communicating newer data showing vaccine vs. natural infection arguments going countered.  really appreciate unlike sites trying predict virus behave, live, think update week (I would guess computations expensive run real time).

Anyway, order make good predictions, also need accurate estimate real adjust graph show entire pandemic beginning switch ""confirmed infections"" see spike getting numbers winter. still hit peak though. switch ""estimated infections"". almost three times high highest peak winter. Estimating 90K/day infections. We're vaccinated polio, chickenpox myriad life threatening diseases babies.

These people fucking idiots, talking choice sociopolitical bullshit.

Your right swing fist ends might meet face period.

The narrorive needs change. 

Lay blame unvaccinated be. 
They ones driving pandemic now.

There's perfectly safe vaccine choose get it. immunologist noted coronavirus respiratory virus particles small enough go masks. also argued vaccines effective stop spread COVID-19 virus ‚Äúanimal reservoirs.‚Äù COVID vaccines ease symptoms, don‚Äôt stop spread virus, Stock noted.

So technically true ignores (intentionally) fact virus carried droplets (pay attention, Covid basics 101) easily stopped masking. 

And second point, that‚Äôs entirely certain yet there‚Äôs many people masking. Vaccines stopped viruses virus means spread mutate, died out.

These measures needed taking collective effort everyone half population acting like bunch whiney babies. studies look mrna vaccines? provoke immune response differently? I'm full support vaccinations, I'd love know applicable previous vaccines studies comparison mrna. don‚Äôt need advanced degrees know foods lifestyles healthy us. varying reasons don‚Äôt always what‚Äôs best. already saving lives , tasked setting example too?  horrified. last year longer see relative way. never knew family could heartless. sister pregnant hope every single one nurses hospital staff vaccinated gives birth, lives South probably not. misinformation. caution things tested. giving info isnt vaccinating pregnant women. much trial period still. one rush time.

The Trump strategy kick toward state local. could said eagerly awaiting mask mandated governor, CDC, city council. county board health, mask mandates neighborhood associations. could kick way suggest individual vigilantes enforce mask mandated instead local, state, federal government. stance remarkable different. Texas: KNOW RIGHTS!!! get vaccinated! wear masks! right make take mask gun point. get help us.

Healthcare workers: Pass.  Travelers coming either, say, pay rising. key question whether hospitalization rate stabilized plateaued. One would hope double dose protect 60 hospitalized.

Look covid numbers India, Brazil, argentina, across Europe. still rising, majority population vaccinated, mutations result. responded post lumping friend group US citizens, hence confusion. Right people rather spread out, lots outdoor activities indoor ones. helps. winter comes though, kids school activity shifts indoors. mean see Provincetown outbreak. crappy weekend everyone packed indoors definitely aided spread. nice sunny weekend, people would beach winds would blown virus away instead concentrating it. crazy went vaccines return normal nope‚Ä¶ still wear mask may able return normal life long time. know it‚Äôs simple it‚Äôs frustrating seeing progress made last months kind eroded 

Governments knew everyone would vaccinated country globally yet insist everyone 90% would get vaccinated seems like never happen  delicious irony highlighting (almost) unfathomably abject stupidity? 


To steal tagline, ""I'm lovin' it."". Oh, GAF, many giving fucks wrong thing.  Traveling nurses PAs already thing typically compensated much higher rate. imagine covid care probably many multiples higher normal could hourly rate 2-3x local hospital job would pay. Uhh money.. lots lots money one videos, locking rich guy's big front gate. sealing symbolic humiliating, continue defy probably get dragged real quarantine facility (or jail).

They say initial ""sealing"" paper tape. person breaks seal, bar in. barring step 2. sounds like theyre going guidelines set forth professional society. american college obstetricians gynecologists recommends vaccination pregnant lactating individuals. getting vaccinated gives bebby antibodies.

My wife pregnant vaccinated, even question. thought physician would recommend otherwise abhorrent. Yes, people risk severe cases, contribute vast vast majority them, vaccinated.

Severe cases elderly cases, vast majority time. Thank you. calculations rough estimate. makes point even clearer. People share sources worst. proud shit take share got from. Best case convince right, worse case still look stupid thinking legit. Nothing really lose.  Keep mind rule what's right, rule legal interpretations constitutionality. it‚Äôs worth, Florida done better Texas vaccination front. Especially since like 80% elderly Florida fully vaccinated. 

That may role play. Yet overcame phobia got jab, rational decent person would. yep, like can't get flu twice, right? thing is, already, going endemic people going catch again. chance get past possibility long gone thinks he‚Äôs land Republican presidential nomination.

It likely won‚Äôt one day every region everyone realizes time. end pandemic different every country ACOG SMFM advocate vaccination pregnant women. I'm vaccinated wear mask everywhere. want imprisoned never change.  as? concern, would likely first three months. Fortunately, concerns haven‚Äôt demonstrated.  moved Canada almost three years ago, family- including son- still back Texas. I'm starting think I'll never see again. Mandatory testing apply unvaccinated, way, crucial. know that. I'm pushing silly argument. 

But fact check, run CBP told CNN migrants taken custody required wear face masks provided agency ‚Äúanyone exhibits signs illness CBP custody, referred local health systems appropriate testing, diagnosis, treatment.‚Äù 

then job journalist find they're actually referred way, that's policy reality ground looks much different.

Because headline Fox news this:

""AZ Attorney General scolds Biden administration releasing COVID-positive migrants"" citing say problem. I'm citing show people OP talking worried about.

So Covid positive migrants referred local health system appropriate testing, diagnosis, treatment, sent bus wherever?

If Covid positive anywhere else supposed quarantine.

Again, believe makes big difference overall situation. difference delta anti-vax. I'm saying is: agree conclusion article, journalistic work shoddy. think argument bad even agree conclusion. Labor rights one thing, forbidding rules protect employees children different story. Add top retribution paying people following unlawful orders. basically akin making order says cannot opposite party governor people switch parties strip pay. cannot that. Physician here.

ICU nurse usually 1 2 pts, unlike floor nurse mave 8 more. ICU therapies require continuous monitoring used: infusion vasoactive rx (like adrenaline-like rx), antiarrhythmics, sedatives, others. Advanced airway management: intratracheal intubation mechanical ventilation.

What awful people can't consider viable reasons?

There always reasons baby. One could look US birth rate note many choosing to, wonder one took risk, what's country look like years? Ok question flu vaccine! asked every pharmacist year get flu shot thry can't answer it! flu shot get year protect particular variant forever? makes wonder exactly waiting approval think FDA find make want approve it? Millions upon millions people already received vaccine. Many different types vaccines. Might well get sooner later. 

It's like FDA holding back strange reason either. process get things approved approved around Sept one quickest FDA approved vaccines time. safe. know vaccines work. know particular disease exactly works. understand technology behind vaccines better disease itself.  listening shitwinds. specifically people think obey everything they're told 'the leaders' - maybe people threatened MUST go back school else 'consequence' - even arrest threat maybe ie -'its law refuse sending kids back school'.. 

(Im sorry - currently bigger problem going on, even kids dont get sick - spread people - COVID fact cause permanent lasting damage!! -like 'smoker lungs', brain damage - maybe even organ failure, happen totally healthy people)..

Maybe people say 'but look everyones - therefore big deal..' - 'but I've got vaccine, even kids - wont hurt us anymore.. even wear masks! CDC even said so..' -Your exposed virus wearing protection due vaccine 100% cure susceptible infection thus may cause mutated variant adapted vaccines occur - virus chance infect vaccine -a 'breakthrough case'. even vaccine STILL cause permanent damage body!!! Press conference hour ago, results less expected.

The important point opinion: another lockdown/further restrictions vaccinated people fall. finally means: whatever happens regards case numbers, give f*** anymore carry life. Finally. 

Unvaccinated people tested entering public indoor space, tests free anymore October.  also pisses people go 'likely kids fine', ignoring fact would call kid 'fine' they're s*uddenly orphan/only one parent now.*

* acts like kind big reveal vaccinated people spread disease. widely acknowledged well known fact. goal vaccination reduce serious illness hospitalizations, slow (not eliminate) spread. 
* claims covid outbreak middle summer possible respiratory viruses can't spread summer. That's literally true. plenty covid infections last summer vaccine. plenty huge covid outbreaks hot countries vitamin deficiency low. I've also caught flu summer plenty times. claim literally made up.

Vaccines like pharmaceuticals. part, show weight/height/body size/etc. based response. fact, uncommon childhood vaccines 100% identical adult doses. areas encounter regular significantly differing response across populations biological sex admin part vaccination drives people crazy right now. 

This nothing admin system, conflating two irresponsible. admin system something legitimate complaints. Age restrictions based upon clinical data, lack thereof, 100% totally different arbitrary age-based cutoffs decided bureaucrats. understand one draw line somewhere

It drawing line, safety efficacy data support use. fundamental feature regulatory system keeps people safe ensures pharmaceuticals say. seen happens require safety efficacy data. resulting deaths injuries, FDA developed risk based approach ensure safety pharmaceuticals. 

For example, FDA requiring manufacturers submit additional data myocarditis risks approving 12. recently noted risk one really observe younger ages allowed take vaccine. lot know risk. Considering risks COVID 18 significantly less ensuring vaccine good harm extra critical. given emergency, floating (or rolling? I‚Äôm sure imof term) year system would smarter.

I totally understand concerns, end day, side effects (if any) vaccine, much better actually getting COVID. fertility doctor said unfortunately one patients unvaccinated, got covid, lost baby. Shit, sign up. want booster already (even though done vaccines April). 

Hoping got real deal! Good thing Democrats control House Senate then! 

Again, need repeat, effort 1980s raise drinking age. far less imperative keeping Americans, mostly children likelihood, dying preventable deaths due overflowed hospitals respiratory pandemic. One excuse inaction face catastrophe long. Democrats demanded kids go school last year? point states, pretty much every low vaccination state, seems trajectory herd immunity. Can't help feeling message severity starting get across states, governments putting precautions back place vaccination rate increases little late.

Pfizer vaccine requires dilution administration, prone mishandling compared Moderna. 

Anecdotally speaking, I've seen ""empty"" Pfizer vials least 1-2 doses left, due lack zero dead space needles extract 6 doses vial.   hope right too. Scott Gottlieb, lot interviews, keeps mentioning that, barring vaccine busting variant, last surge infection.  point, aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated, doubt much anything convince them. I‚Äôm going random pregnant saying something like that, reality, reminding people mortality might honestly help anything else. Especially many pregnant women ending ICU.

In lot circles, pregnancy isn‚Äôt considered high risk situation, especially pandemic. someone concerned side effects vaccine, reminding far worse realities virus kind seems prudent. Especially decision effects lot them.

Obviously don‚Äôt think someone solely say ‚Äúyou another baby‚Äù included actual information data possible risks vaccines, versus virus, said slightly less cavalier way think it‚Äôs important reality note. You‚Äôve got one chance life, always another kid even involve alternate routes so. It‚Äôs true, matter cruel statement feels say. group teachers refused maskless party got covid shut school down. working really hard keep kids person time. Fantastic right?

And you‚Äôre right, bills seem never stop go ER. think received six different bills total last time kid went‚Äîfor actual visit, doctors, imaging, etc. It‚Äôs nuts. happened Spring pulled newest bill week ago. feel sad anyone waited vaccine planning baby antivaxxers got baseless claim would impact fertility. you‚Äôre pregnant, you‚Äôre going nervous getting vaccinated also increased risk dying covid. bright side could luck end baby antibodies.

Kids likely die. Although immune death, 15 kids (0-17) Florida died covid. Compare 18+ Fuck, real. feel same.

He's sure going get it, would high risk. odds would favor :( Yeah, strange. see countries mandating teachers get vaccinated. Wow, mess. instead? talking kids heart too? I'd prefer get political conversation, either. yes, is, multiplying two entities (federal state) using citizens pawns one good.

In Italy cases lowest ever months now, started reaching 30/40% population vaccinated even delta variants still basically impossible come back numbers last year national message current administration ""open everything, schools safe, lock down, enforce mask mandates, get money.""

My governor's message ""open everything, schools safe, lock down, enforce mask mandates, get money.""

There much daylight perspectives like believe. Replacing one messages much ""solution"", it? Oh, great idea. abolish meetings permanently live world one gets sick? surely worth it!  Whenever see people cite data information COVID barely effects kids, it‚Äôs like forget last March kids first major group people sought protect. 

Even heavily conservative state, schools implemented strict protocols almost immediately, carried next school session too.

Yes, believe data shows kids likely different immune response COVID, large exposure different thus far think many people overlook reality. ‚ÄúBut children can‚Äôt get COVID!!‚Äù hear one time I‚Äôm going punch parent face. really sorry hear partner's circumstances deal sister. Wishing family best, stay safe there. question scale. We're talking 10 million people still unvaccinated variant incredibly transmissible transmitted vaccinated people. percentage people got getting transmit it.

The unvaccinated baseline, millions cases go Texas. vast majority feel like crap bit spread it, sure. subset long covids and/or hospitalizations, subset ICU beds and/or deaths.

The coming week, January indication, going bad time lot Texans. Get whatever get now, US, 2 pfizer/Moderna shot series. know plenty enough COVID infection short term. standpoint principled one anything. safe protect pharm industry negligence? FDA approve it?

When probably get it. point, young healthy almost chance getting serious illness this. got co-morbidities secondary issues. willing put butts line, would willing put mine? know long term effects. vaccine new method providing ""immunity"" never release FDA approval. like flu vaccine mmr. use pieces weakned viruses. similar virus self infects cells (using mRNA) create spike protein resembles covid spike protein additional additives induce faster immune response. 

I would surprised already covid. Never got sick felt sick past 4 years. never much anything protect it. I've traveled overseas multiple countries mutlille us cities states height covid outbreak.    Democrats go logic variety ways lmao.

But yes everyone refusing get vaccine non genuine medical reasons idiot. That's horrifying. ""Damn it. end Four Season Landscaping?"" That's I'm hoping. sister got vaccine pregnant doctor's encouragement.

Hence person charge oxford vaccine saying export doses, give people already protected more. I'm sure plays role it, still

[There's currently higher percentage folks age 18-29 hospitalized FL folks age 60-69 (which going Delta, actually does't much higher share population vaccinated FL -- 54% vs. 50%).

At rate, 70% eligible people first dose week - 60% total population 8 days. peer-reviewed study concludes ‚Äúabsolutely evidence‚Äù covid-19 vaccines affect fertility women men.

I actually skin game too. I'm professional entertainer living. realized important people live job vital life.

Vaccines effective they're perfect. especially since current data shows unvaccinated people spread rate vaccinated people combined Delta variant rates make massive 10,000+ person music festivals - often already poor hygiene distancing - incredibly irresponsible.

If 100% vaccinated would different story. unfortunately bunch people get vaccinated, vaccines made mandatory. responsible people going ""punished"" irresponsible people get vaccinated.

And can't say gives shit unvaccinated. unless make can't clog hospitals, can't continue stress health care workers, otherwise burden society stupidity. still matters they're getting sick.

So know know event like definitely going super-spreader. say ""How privileged life can't go 2 years without music festival. literally mean people die"" restraining order means state can‚Äôt implement law. It‚Äôs really restraining order like domestic violence.  numbers account Delta. Yeah, dad's school starting back weeks.

Why would matter parents still ask you‚Äôre vaccinated? simple (and seemingly painless) response question would ‚ÄúAll school staff required vaccinated.‚Äù could even print copy policy, post it, ask, *tap sign* virus never going away.

It's infuriating. Cuomo resigned. point stands. actively worked protect NYers. exactly. it‚Äôs extremely frustrating. Politicians don‚Äôt make vaccines, moron.

Trumpian cousin even posted Facebook day, ""why wear mask protect neighbors?"" - and, Evangelical Christian too. week 2nd dose moderna Maybe Texas Republicans ate less avocado toast they'd able afford decent hospital system. Yeah, really confused people called intended immune response ""side-effects"". brain, automatically interpret side-effects non-intentional unhelpful effects drug. Immune response vaccine neither unintended unhelpful.

Not sure people about. say tech: feature, bug! trans people using bathroom. mother high blood pressure, diabetic shes taking blood thinners due recent blood clot. side effects shots (Pfizer) it'll kind lockdown half places closed many staff sick covid fools downgrading state facts? that's quite true    got wrecked first shot already, likely infected virus point earlier.  amazed jail yet? considered local news story ""stop presses let's cover 24/7 news item focus on?"" mean asking *others* calm down.

Luckily (sort of) convinced quite people firmly it. parent, perspective BAD PEOPLE NEED STOP TRYING DOWNPLAY IT. deaths higher hospitalizations would better comparison. 99.82% Americans died Covid, details OC above. 

So 30% eligible Americans get vaccinated basically 150,000 additional, preventable deaths (and accounts ~180k expected 30% remain unvaccinated less ~30k vaccinated 0.01% go vectors reduced; also account potentially variations could resistant vaccine, deadly, Covid complications line point appear much prevalent vaccine complications. Wondering anyone covid already vaccinated? symptoms look like vaccinated people? I‚Äôve vaccinated couple months sore inflamed throat right now.. worried could somehow covid since leave go abroad couple days. harassing people turning car headlights on. Why? vaccine lessens symptoms someone might need intensive care treated priority?

Or thin veil mask stupid schadenfreude? SCHOOL EVEN STARTED YET. That's pretty good considering vaccine rate 65+ extremely high.

My B.S. detector goes hear 99.99%.

That's all. didn‚Äôt go away. 1918 pandemic lasted 11 years began wane become manageable.

[Spanish Flu Pandemic vaccine wasn‚Äôt available early 1940s.

The good thing vaccines available let‚Äôs hope pray doesn‚Äôt take long.

But Covid stay unfortunately like Flu now. Exactly, pay $9.99 month it. default oppose anything right gate gives administrators power teachers There's absolutely reason us either ""team cohesion"". Whatever means. 

It's masters cracking whip. Wow mean, personally that, certainly can't judge decision. reasonable expect people give 2 weeks lives protect others. reasonable expect people continue month two like that, try control crisis. maybe even within reason ask people continue making sacrifices 6 months tried fight thing.

But damn near year half now. 86 year old, year half INSANELY long time. simply many year-and-a-halfs left life give up. know medical situation, pretty much 86 year old probably liable drop dead given month, least, develop debilitating condition going ruin rest life know it. neither practical realistic expect people, even responsible well-intentioned people, sacrifice YEARS life fight something like this. enemy invisible, ever-changing, individual basis, really threatening. could've told back March ever saw another covid wave, would little/no response it. people completely spent. flatline empty.

In April 2020, understand many people irate inconveniencing weeks could try put stop thing. August 2021, opposite - understand people expect regular people continue living like this. Yep, none countries authoritarian China high vaccination rates. Countries actual high vaccination rates, lockdowns like vaccines. Unless employee federal government property owned federally funded, ability issue ""mask mandate"" claim. federal government recommend mask mandates done that. mask mandates hero striking state local government. He's tyrant. vaccinated within 2 months kids, careful another 1 month, probably finish time enjoy normal Christmas. won't.

It's honestly amazing people think that.

You could careful whole year, vaccinate 100% countries population. Guess what? come back. majority worlds population vaccinated. There's finishing off. stay, everyone know infected point life, matter careful are. I'm looking forward release Delta Pro Delta Pro Max. exactly Read article close number California sure that's true everywhere though. Switzerland close top, least know sure, country higher relative percentage them, higher US und EU countries sure. However, overall vaccination readiness fairly low western central European country e.g. Portugal, Spain, Denmark, Ireland UK far ahead. expand R values herd immunity bit, here‚Äôs simplified example assuming 100% effective vaccine.

If disease R0 2, group 10 infected people expected infect 20 people. break exponential growth, would need 10+(50%+) group 20 immune either via infection vaccination. 51%, average person infects less 1 person disease eventually dies out.

At R0=3, 10 people infect 30. still need 10 fewer infections, need 20+ (66%) people immune.

At R0=7, 10 infects 70. need 60/70 protected (85.7%).


All assumes normal contact rates. decrease contact rates (mask wearing, social distancing, limit super spreader events, etc), effective R value lowered threshold herd immunity lowered accordingly. 

That‚Äôs long term solution everywhere, manage flare ups. sits it. medical professionals scientists. even majority involved patient care. yea im well aware get published‚Ä¶Im researcher I‚Äôm saying still divide especially look medical field broadly well many nurses well reject vaccinations. Yes, never implication. strictly talking purchasing power. never claimed directly correlated. Sounds like Vancouver Island?

I personally visiting Vancouver Island week USA. fully vaccinated, tests such. think we'll telling many people US. cases fairly low here, now. cases lower this, Delta arrived, cases gone way up.

Not doom sayer, gonna happen too. Canada proud vaccination catch (after royally fucking imo), fine, BC vaccination rate 74%/63%. Well, San Francisco vaccination 77%/70% cases went 11/day 300/day. Delta monster, huge R value R=5 - 9 (as per wikipedia). 

&amp;#x200B;

The good news Delta much easier test for, much virulent much prevalent nose. RT-PCR tests detect fairly easily. Found person without school age kids! I‚Äôll never understand 5 days week companies. see writing wall? Frankly, needed hard lockdown. would worth it. foreign travel done. Harsh penalties going anything except food medical care/medications, etc. getting groceries medical care survive, going jail, exceptions.

Lol, good luck getting whole world get board that. mention, would still many people working essential jobs keep supply chain running. People poorer countries would starve death. that's without even mentioning fact COVID 19 large animal reservoirs.

People denial, pretty clear day one SARS-CoV-2 endemic, us rest lives. simply good virus. thing could see eradicating sterilizing vaccine, may never happen. dunno - bit stretch. lot European countries also quite bit vaccine hesitancy well. closer think, mumps level, yes, none data I've seen thrown around suggests infective measles*. also bit irrelevant distinction know people gotten going drive-thru. Prevention measures need quite extreme spread.

*In context R0 really single (important) parameter epidemiological model. something actually measure make models assume different R0 get identical results. It'll take long time there's consensus R0 delta be.  nothing far AFAIK suggests long covid vaccinated. want ever catch COVID, bad time. ain't going anywhere. get treatment start actually getting penalties spreading disease kill people. AIDs works way, COVID. Culture culture.


The cultural impulse says it‚Äôs solely incumbent upon individual use guns responsibly, thinks mitigating risk exposure best achieved individual Choices. keep mind 71% relative protection hospitalisation poor compared 92% AstraZeneca 96% BioNTech/Pfizer course, based population, direct comparison difficult, imo gap large ignore.

Anyway, Pfizer-BioNTech change formula, others effective initial infection. Maine mvp  appears so. Anecdotally though. I‚Äôm sure many didn‚Äôt expect masks return also don‚Äôt think social distancing capacity limits come back.

Must hard companies mandate vaccines still work home. There‚Äôs things called masks vaccines could prevent suffering. people would rather take chances either dying Covid potential long term effects vs getting vaccine significantly cuts chances hospitalized supposed long term effects vaccine.

That's tenfold reduction fatality risk absolute game vaccines definitely effective preventing severe disease delta variant, vaccinated people catch transmit far higher rate acknowledged.

There's scientific data that. scientifically proven thing makes Delta dominant variant increases spread shorter incubation period, 4 days vs 6 days Alpha. replicates faster infected (unvaxxed) became infectious 2 days earlier. said, memory t-cells memory b-cells recall 1 3 days fully-vaxxed immunocompetents. immune system start killing virus become infectious.

Anyways, exercising covid? ok? make things worse? What‚Äôs name it?? People's convictions go window money involved. Remember early days pandemic?

Great, way full lockdown don‚Äôt get shit together‚Ä¶ Vaccines PLUS masks. I'm shocked talk family back US (not even Texas/Florida), they're telling local ICU slammed covid patients.

Masks required, food drink always prohibited.  would never want enter live Country state 'judge' kind right/power. hospitals filling unvaccinated patients. vaccines reduce chances hospitalized 25x.

Put another way, 100% population fully vaccinated got breakthrough infections simultaneously, would equivalent load hospitals random 4% unvaccinated population infected.

Vaccinated people threat hospital system

Fortunately, exactly way vaccines keep people hospital, large recovery natural infections thing. Disclaimer: obviously, better getting vaccinated, since infection kill since getting disease get immunity said disease *insane*.

By end wave, likely virtually every unvaccinated person infected. point, everyone immunity, disease neither threaten hospital system lead mass death. 

At least idea.

The massively unfair things yet authorized third vaccine doses immunocompromised children yet eligible vaccine.

I think going here, people mean say virus become endemic.

Obviously, right need mask public, keep hospital system overwhelmed, *as already absolutely happening South*. States functioning governments cannot allow happen. Ok, makes sound stupid. 

Better? I‚Äôd argue problem major portion pandemic, hard scientists mostly ignored due over-appreciation (read: fear of) sociopolitical economic consequences.  No. Catching rona part experiance.  Governor virus tracker raided detained, absolutely trust Florida's Covid numbers. Honest! /s gotten vaccinated‚Ä¶ all, better transparency this. knew back March 35% people 80 produce insufficient amount antibodies stop infection double dose. amazing much snowball effect become. Like soon government required federal employees, businesses fell line started own. Cool, link then. Here's 70 studies  free, could prevent long-term damage get bad roll end long-Covid. 


Unless live buttfuck nowhere viable transport arrangement anywhere offering vaccinations, there's little reason get it. Think free insurance.   jnj safe I‚Äôm worried vaccine side effects covid itself, I‚Äôm getting shot job   I‚Äôm happy hug extra hard Yes, he's gonna you. Lol. Delusional! Previous infection + J&amp;J pretty good. point is, anyone point rare exceptions something use justification overreaction.

I don‚Äôt like right it, don‚Äôt like left it.  I‚Äôm infectious disease expert, tried understand Florida complete wreck, found Florida one population dense places America. around 25 fully vaccinated (49%, almost 70% least one shot), puts 25 states *below* us. Yet number 2 spread (behind Louisiana). One big difference top 10 density. I‚Äôd add *four* major metropolitan areas (not Illinois‚Äô one).

Zero states America even 70% fully vaccinated (I think Vermont highest around 67%. I‚Äôd also note low pop density). 

Wyoming around 37% fully vaxxed doesn‚Äôt look Iike FL TX. doesn‚Äôt even one large metro, much less Florida‚Äôs four. 

It‚Äôs true south hot people staying inside, maybe they‚Äôre 10 people instead 5? 

Maybe FL big cities people staying heat. think see snow falls people north crowd together.

It‚Äôs interesting question. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  You. clearly idiot here. Hence boosting. understanding nothing well 6 months point elderly antibodies decline considerably. sort unexpected turn events. depends, severe disease generate strong protection, vs. asymptomatic cases. What‚Äôs safest vaccine ? already covid job prob gonna mandate soon get jnj call day news CDC last week event breakthrough infection (infection vaccinated) people carrying virus someone vaccinated. theory would infectious someone unvaccinated.

lol backing voter army uneducated, ignorant dumb Florida, that's whole lot people Every single time see something country want hide corner. 103.7 fever 2nd dose, violently shaking, chills, felt horrible. Lasted 1 day.

As soon FDA says get 3rd dose I‚Äôll first line. though CDC tracking breakthrough cases? majority people die auto accidents wearing seatbelts. say anything effectiveness seatbelts? course not. people die auto accidents wearing seatbelts 90% people wear seatbelts.

The statistic would want know risk dying auto accident wearing seatbelt, compared wearing seatbelt. Likewise, meaningful statistic would risk death Covid unvaccinated people compared vaccinated. Otherwise statistic used deceive. help understand table 4? say 82% women got vaccine 1st trimester resulted spontaneous abortion, reading data incorrectly? become danger around you

Any evidence? We're currently facing Mexico. government time declaring we're alert level red (the highest), ordering reopening presential school classes. Teachers received early vaccination, Cansino, couple days ago announced booster shot needed.

Currently people protesting using hashtag (Means ""Since They're Children"") He's talking US. wave, people left least immunity covid.

Look uks data then. shows asymptomatic, symptomatic, sought treatment hospital outpatient, inpatient hospital, overnifht, death, vaccination status, full, partial, days shot, 50 yrs old etc.

The breakthrough rate like 12 percent cases. rare. Vaccinated serious hospitalization death exceedingly rare young, rare old. state better send anyone. lockdown hurts everyone According CDC, 1507 vaccinated people US died Covid-19. number isn‚Äôt sorted variant, entirely sure that‚Äôs important? Large parts US health care deserts aren‚Äôt much different developing country.  Yeah, ending end 2021. Florida Texas around, it‚Äôll probably late 2022/early 2023. Good, lockdowns work much so. Unless unfortunate 0.01%, would imagine get immediately admitted front unvaxxed. pray so. think be. DeSantis said would seasonal so...

Okay, anecdote doesn‚Äôt mean people greater risk vaccines... side effects Moderna, lasted day feeling fine day after. one family got Moderna rest family ended getting Pfizer. far I'm aware of, none side effects it.

With said, take whatever vaccine can. I'd rather feel bad day catch covid potentially fall deathly ill. it‚Äôs worth, [mRNA vaccine technology animals quite years.

Also, sungliht kill corona tougher though delta. high vax rates Seattle think we'd get full third wave, definitely are. I'm one-or-two degrees away lot people recently covid, *all* people vaccinated. we're wearing masks work, going shows, etc. vax rate high, high enough overpower combination 100% pre-covid lifestyles contagious variant lol. experimental antiviral called DRACO may protect viruses - tested flu, common cold, others - likely protect COVID well - works differently usual antibodies that'd cover outer part virus - DRACO hand sits inside bodies cells detects whether virus actually enters cell hijack virus put self destruct code onto virus - instead cell looking virus producing viruses reads self destruct immediately dies.

So antibodies basically coat exterior virus misses spot virus still infect thus causing viruses produced - basically perhaps vaccines 100% effective - effectiveness / concentration antibodies.

Now - imagine getting antibodies first line defense - DRACO case virus get through.

So basically perhaps antibodies may wear time perhaps due mutation unlike DRACO may way effective -even protecting even mutated variants..

However angered literally NOONE talking DRACO - completely unknown..

Texas overall 53/44, big cities like Austin, Dallas, Houston, El Paso higher state average, 58/50, West Texas crazy high like 80/68 :) less populated counties bring average way down, like 30% fully.

This third shitty time history I‚Äôve lived through. I‚Äôm done all. think got position putting political theater middle pandemic? Mmm what‚Äôs mindset you‚Äôre referring exactly?

So getting vaccinated, convinced vaccines untested harmful, getting covid would different common cold. mother pleaded sister get vaccinated... late lol. judges getting vaccines arms extremely vulnerable people organization clearly getting done. defendants also agree get vaccinated reduce probation petty crimes like drug addiction (possession). Mask mandate? miss days could call someone c word nothing would ever done.

I've wearing mask work go every day since last March April. **never** went away many others. 

They never gone away, anyone. drop June suggests undersampling‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs right approach now. variant far far transmissible. unvaccinated right it‚Äôs run - point - many people going expose? coolest summer record, least üòÖ 100s season.  Ignore him. last thing insulting people finally making right choice. could end sending right back anti-vax crowd.

While initial mindset ignorant, finally realized making mistake making right decision. shows growth. Thank research changing mind! making right decision children. protecting yourself, family, community! makes difference.

The laws physics disagree. burn calories intake, lose mass. problem obese people realize much less actually eating. We‚Äôll take care pesky animal reservoirs destroying planet. Well lets theorize. Lock 100 people room, sing, dance whatnot. One person group positive. 12hrs likelyhood another person positive? 

All know zero chance.

End days type shit. lot vaccinated people pissed wear masks again, seem hard-core stance antivax/antimask crowd. idea suddenly think masks help proven do, vaccinated people get spread it. Plus, bringing back masks force unvaccinated cover again, least cases. also contains shorter RNA. Pfizer used much longer antigen Moderna ~300 amino acids.

So mass means proportionately molecules well. differences less likely due amount mRNA instead different antigens used. say vaccines protect better infection. anti vaxxers likely continue get infected regular basis... Perhaps annually sooner. long? Yesterday florida 5x covid deaths next state. accounted almost 35+% new deaths 27% new cases.


And noted florida actually good job getting 65+ year olds vaccinated, younger people dying. 

Take look daily cases/deaths chart, increasing exponentially without signs slowing.  upset people want get vaccinated vaccinated citizens spread virus efficiently un-vaccinated? 

No. less likely yo covid first place get vaccinated. also less likely need hospital bed. Yeah, like people make leap ""it possible vaccinated person catch it"" ""unvaccinated vaccinated same!""

It's possible person wearing seatbelt die, therefore let's abolish seatbelts! got J&amp;J back April. county 45% vaxxed, I'm really contemplating getting one mRNA vaccines too.

I'm talking ER ICU  lots evidence one one conversations vaccine reluctant people, particularly people color, traditionally suspicious health care system, help increase vaccine rates. also good data migrant farm workers simply really heard much vaccine, underserved health care system. Targeted messaging folks might also help increase vax rate population. agree insults condescension limit, probably helpful achieving goal want. However, difficult, face blatant anti-vax stupidity, reason people want anything actual facts.

I think time mandates here, basically take ""choice"" hands. seeing mandates vaccine--I think direction need go, much possible. ‚ÄúScientists found 99% pregnant women admitted hospital Covid-19 unvaccinated, Delta variant posing greater risk severe disease.‚Äù would fight way supreme court necessary. court would side. 

its life supporting instruments care personnel. I'm sure google wiki help further. United stand, divided we.....repeatedly fill hospitals people sick dying covid repeatedly crap health care workers, health systems, everyone else part needs treatment cancer, brain aneurysms, etc. 

Oh kids....divided create society kids removed definition ""everyone"" speak behave either regard harmful intention. Great job 'Merica. think everyone became disease enthusiasts since beginning last year. like keeping informed relevant topics unfortunately, COVID-19 still quite relevant.

There's also billions unvaccinated developing countries consider.

If keep boosting west production cant diverted unvaccinated might lead extending pandemic even more...  lock works. Thats lesson article. lol Yeah, they're spreading, people acting like means they're ***everything***. Vaccines still make less likely infected first place likely milder case get infected.

Sounds like every country world. know lot pre-prints China stopped like, March April? government put stop info leaving country one point, sure change that. 

The COVID19 sub learned that. many articles read February April (I became exhausted!)

Hell time alive, huh? got stories future generations! 

I'm curious, Economist, disease ""enthusiast?"" love reading diseases! sort like reality-horror really lets us know nature charge! üòÇ August 2021, scientifically known, beyond redemption.

He‚Äôs killing Floridians spreading misinformation, imposing laws schools can‚Äôt mandate masks precious children go fucking private schools guess what? Mandate fucking masks. pissed runs pres. He‚Äôs done nothing fuck Florida. Sadly, obesity may prevent doctors giving sound medical advice. Imagine telling patient needs lose 30 pounds 60 pounds overweight yourself.  talking about? consequences past covid cases occured might able help understand risk highlighting. one said wouldn‚Äôt. Would feel differently willing take precautions? feel risk still high personally given concert increase delta? Thank thoughts.  now, study Israel found highest level antibodies cord blood mother fully vaccinated 30 weeks. 7 months pregnant vaccine became available me. doctor told get whichever available ASAP (Kentucky, USA). ended getting J&amp;J, fine. Please get vaccinated you‚Äôre pregnant!! Immunity carry baby first months, soooo important. North remembers Vaccines diseases, infections. long known. Reduced transmission prior delta great, designed end-point trial.

Our education system failed us, producing way many morons like MTG congress. shame trust ""Fact checkers"" much cousin posts Facebook point.

Do think cause surge? No, 100%. think adding surge, definitely. Stress. time sit good meal. Grab go whatever free pizza donuts sitting break room. Running fumes time. Eating decompress. 15 hour shifts, little sleep. like there‚Äôs doctors smoke addicted pain killers. Yes someone ‚Äúknow‚Äù better, life messy stress pushes us sometimes unhealthy things take edge off. Let's assume entirely right, evidence vaccine reducing spread reducing symptoms, *become danger*, *remain danger* take vaccine *you remain danger, less risk* take vaccine. Moderna/Pfizer booster us when?? end"" preventable.. blessed science vaccines people can‚Äôt even get right :(  doubletake read ""double jointed"". disappointed. wife gave birth 3 months ago pretty much experience. vaccinated now, pregnancy OB said can‚Äôt recommend gets shot unknown‚Ä¶. incredibly stressful pregnant Covid. 

Long story short, can‚Äôt blame women vaccinated. Like all. trying make best decision baby given information available ‚Ä¶which virtually none right now. better - prove sinking level.

Which continue win elections over; aren‚Äôt least bit afraid lie, cheat, steal way victory. 

Not saying I‚Äôm advocating sides that, highlighting much disadvantage honesty morality unfortunately. Anecdotally, same. First dose Dec 2020, day 7 feeling much better now. worst part body aches/chills neusea-inducing headaches. Cannot imagine sick I'd without vaccine.  It‚Äôs Bird‚Äôs Eye nothing! Needs upvotes. benefits internal discord, country US can‚Äôt even get page simplest way pandemic? FTA:
 children COVID-19 mild symptoms, yet enough evidence conclude delta causes severe disease children variants do, scientists said.  always option waiting get pregnant receiving vaccine. Birth control option. think come publicly, like Arkansas Gov, admit wrong. Unfortunate. Delta resistant vaccine (compared alpha) could get away ""vaccinated only"" situation. considering still pass virus breakthrough case, get it. much outside happens am. 

But needs done push unvaccinated people engaging society. reason dealing shit 8 months post-vaccine covid. It‚Äôs infuriating. great NPR piece discussed ‚Äúpatient centered‚Äù care upholding patient autonomy creating confusion-particularly pregnant women. Mixed messaging indeed. someone mentioned below, ACOG updated stance (only week ago!!) definitively recommend vaccine pregnant women. 

[‚ÄúOpinion: Doctors Candid ACOG Statement (Updated July 30,  Same, sort easy button everyone could push prevent covid entering home hospitalizing  It‚Äôs crazy many people moved since pandemic started 900 people day. Mostly NY, NJ, MA. can‚Äôt follow people‚Äôs thought process would move  Thursday 25. 12 . 


Monday 8. 

It Tuesday reporting yesterday's numbers.. Given evidence *against* vaccinating either, decide trust vaccine COVID more. Ideally, exposed neither given risk infected next three months, less risky option seems clear. sort comment really shows fucking insane people are. moderate asthma I'm otherwise healthy young adult takes care body. also vaccinated. chance dying covid insanely low know data vaccine. likely die million things go daily life. Yet sit spout fear mongering misinformation covid kill me. Disgusting.  
  
And anyone jumps saying masks protect others, aware this. simply responding asinine claim covid kill that's wear mask. Vaccine efficacy always falls time, don‚Äôt focus that. 

Vaccines measured prevention capabilities control group. words, unvaccinated folks get Covid develop natural immunities, smaller distance immunity vaccinated vaccinated groups. 

The vaccines still incredibly effective especially preventing serious illness death. Dallas Austin already defying order luckily. Wow. Texas ""conservatives"" made desperate plea federal bailout laughably hypocritical since... know, FEMA bailing freezing Texas power grid customers [5 months [elected leaders America bailing Texas Hurricane Harvey [4 years pointedly done us? Come think it, maybe fucking secede. least could charge bailouts. seem lost grip bootstraps. Hopefully forgot /s Personally, think habits formed early life. dear cuz sat front television sodas bags chips early age. different era 5 kids blaming mother foolish. body sets pattern ""abuse"" almost impossible change. opinion, anyway. wonderful human struggled life obesity. doom kids battle! Fresh healthy food, always! given article OAN yesterday, claimed 600 people miscarriages vaccine.

Basically tore article front face (digitally course) 

1) research team someone gets paid research, seems suspect research would come there

2) hundreds millions people vaccine, 600 miscarriages likely correlation, causation. (pregnant people happened vaccine miscarrage, vaccine cause miscarrage)

But broadcast OAN. :sigh: kind people already likely vaccinated watching it. going ER instead posting Facebook got covid info begin with? Medical industry personnel refusing take vaccine. I'd like hear interviews staff fired explaining reasoning.  current guidance American College Obstetrics Gynecology Society Maternal Fetal Medicine: Get vaccine. UK, public recommendation updated late April, advising pregnant women get vaccinated. generally advised Moderna/Pfizer. public recommendation based real-world data (mostly US) women made choice themselves. though also preliminary data actual clinical trials pregnancy (which started around... Feb think), messaging updated places. Thank you! one #3 us first post-COVID, regular pregnancy stuff another layer angst flavor. üôÉ

Parenting tough, it‚Äôs also best thing ever did! CDC manipulating numbers. made error divided 2 instead 3. work 12 hour days 6 7 days week tends re-prioritize activities outside work you. Arkansas? saw story 800 kids teachers quarantining No, Biden administration put increased effort vaccinating immigrants narrative would change ""Biden open borders bringing immigrants free vaccines"" anti-immigration people never satisfied.  Already confirmed CDC spilt number 2 instead 3. daily case write CORRECT Florida announced. German leaders agreed German government stop paying rapid coronavirus tests order encourage people get vaccinated. Unvaccinated people still required take tests. trickle economics vaccines?

Brb calling Africa let know benefit us getting third fourth shot. would assume anything Marjorie Taylor Greene says categorically false unless strong evidence contrary.  told get first trimester, cautious second definitely get third. responsibility unvaccinated society? asking utilize personal responsibility think they'll actually go along without consequences? already saw worked. Thanks sharing - part reason heard first trimester moms miscarriages shots. figured risk generally low now. Yeah, it‚Äôs really disappointing nurses buy conspiracy nonsense. definitely subset don‚Äôt believe modern medicine, jump every conspiracy bandwagon. It‚Äôs especially upsetting work elderly. community, large amount long term care facility staff refused vaccines Covid. Unfortunately, kids start dying, don‚Äôt think anyone care. Dude.

I'm glad went then, looks like might safe quite while. went hospital oxygen, medical bill can‚Äôt small. hearing average Covid bill like 70k US. Let wallow that. recent joint statement American College Obstetrics Gynecology Society Maternal Fetal Medicine saying every pregnant women vaccinated Retired ER/ICU nurse here. get job non Healthcare field make enough support families. Doctors nurses eat too. horrible time work Healthcare profession. CDC know something Israel whole world even Israel know about

Its odd seeing Israel high vax rates.

Or CDC inconsistent. Tbh travel covid advisories I've seen hella inconsistent, UK amber alert example. madness help Texas Florida equipment staff long governors legislatures creating conditions require them. receive aid drop bans masks, widen testing contact tracing, allow vaccine passports, ramp vaccination campaigns.

It's like medical treatments sometimes rationed according patients' behaviors. Every year thousands people die want donor organs. either cannot get waiting lists far refuse treatment conditions like substance abuse disorder, mental health issues treated. Border? Georgia Alabama? I'm guessing Alabama since place control  ""Craig think wrong type BBC""

Spot on. also hazard everybody else hospital, including immune compromised, cancer patients, etc.

Forget concerts, bars, restaurants. hospitals real hot spots. 
The west hoarded? Vaccinating citizens hoarding? mention nobody knew resistant people would get vaccine.


CCP vaccines available cheaply massively produced, ineffective, vaccines based papers rarely peer reviewed, almost never published international journals, CC refuses announce many infected folks Indonesian authorities begun giving health workers booster Moderna shots hundreds doctors vaccinated Sinovac subsequently infected. Malaysia last month said would stop using Sinovac supplies ran out.

Even best case Chile scenario, CCP vaccines 65.9%, much less Pfizer Moderna. see, much worse countries. Mine started kindergarten. Masks optional first day oly ones masks. kids came home telling kids told disease anymore could take off. So... yeah. send masks im almost positive wasted effort.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  exxxxxxxxxxactly Yeah sure, every expert community wackjobs, scientific opinion peer reviewed scrutinized internally.

More 96% doctors vaccinated June, listening tiny minority vast majority study evidence would super stupid. Long COVID pretty much reason I've afraid COVID.

Just, personally speaking. 

I'm - kidney problems aside - really healthy COVID wrecks days, ok, I'll deal. 

However seeing otherwise healthy people 15-25 years younger actually know suffering mild meaningful lingering effects weeks after?

Screw that. knows might manifest line. Getting vaccine never stopping transmission, Maybe slowing down, beginning made clear vaccinated stop able spread disease. point getting vaccinated keep healthy get it. Focusing transmission missing point entirely.

From CDC:
""Experts say report shows importance getting shot prevent hospitalizations deaths virus continues circulate.

‚ÄúThe biggest takeaway need people vaccinated. vaccines still extremely effective delta,‚Äù said Rachael Piltch-Loeb, public health emergency preparedness response fellow Harvard T.H. Chan School Public Health. ‚ÄúThere significant difference fever dying COVID-19.‚Äù

Monica Gandhi, professor medicine University California, San Francisco, said robust measurements, like examining virus lab, would needed make claim vaccinated unvaccinated people equally infectious."" Yeah, geography obviously DeSantis' strong suit. mean I'm pretty terrible geography come on. get access one, pulse oximeter 20$ they‚Äôre fairly reliable follow instructions package, understand it. check intermittently, tell O2 saturation dipped low 90s 80s, point would advisable seek medical care. always two different types numbers. ""Daily new cases"" ""confirmed daily cases"". frequently takes multiple days confirm positive test. reason believe rate new infections Florida dropped Friday Sunday. always confirmation three day old data 1 day old data.

The weekly data Florida department health matches CDC chart quite close week July 23rd week July 30th. Week starting August 6th going match CDC's chart fairly closely. That'd probably get 2 terms Sorry Florida elected regardless margin, represents Florida now. usual, elections consequence maybe next time people learn stay home waiting unicorn candidate.

As much hated it, Trump represented USA 2016-2020. election results. US going area already ""the brink collapse""? probably survival. basing believe future last two weeks next two weeks always disappointed.  could even make new Britain combine. add Nova Scotia (New Scotland) onto New England. New Brunswick changed names New Wales we'd full set. 
Tbh US Canada ever split up, doubt Atlantic Canada New England would unite. Thanks, might order one Yep brilliant news. Sunday went first football match since march last year pandemic hit hard first lockdown. Thanks many people vaccinated slowly get things back normal. Living proof generations cousins siblings marry other.  ""it takes years go nursing school""

You LVN/LPN 12 months fast track RN 18.  that, transport enough oxygen hospitals need it? (There articles hospitals struggling five days ago.) hospitals systems handle increased delivery needs? (I heard concern raised seen much talk it... suppose moot point can't get oxygen staff first place.)

This like watching video car partway sliding hill icy road. FL already shattering daily infection records January [single day seven day guys enter fresh new level hell governor nothing he's political sycophant thinks victory appealing lowest common denominator cost. criminal, really. Yes, require useless ass kissing Biden absolutely require state mandate mask policies agreeing help.

It politics all, ensuring resources wasted utilized properly. requires lot coordination teachers. We‚Äôve already lost lot teachers retiring Covid. resources aren‚Äôt available. would nice, pipe dream school districts would FSIS recall, believe CDC gave FSIS data higher listeria cases, would FSIS. mean technically would Tyson recalls ""voluntary"" ignore big stick government uses cases. ""handled"" mean? What's solution people getting vaccine then, huh?

I, many people, done everything right. worked home year. mask go out. got vaccine soon available me. 

I can't control idiots do. neither you. neither us predict future regards new variants, hospital capacity, etc. 

How supposed care anti vaxxers care themselves, me? THAT'S get vaccine. YOURSELF. know got yours. Fuck rest em. affect colleges plan students staff return fall? University sending emails boasting X% students planning return campus 3 weeks fully vaccinated. go without hitch? end disaster? phrased: Substitute Teachers eager  full time position vaccinate.  guess that's differ. people denied health precautions beginning. Anti mask, anti distancing, anti vax.   150MM+ vacinnated. empirical evidence exists. time stop forming policy caters conspiracy theorists.  solution exists. Take society move forward. work? we've vaccinated risk folks...is covid over? second jab today. Excellent.

Canada wait 3 months get vaccines, longer.

Next pandemic could much deadlier. Countries need prepare. vaccine started distribution December 2020, lot people got first trimester (women early pregnancy Dec-Mar 2020) beginning babies. initial research done US pregnant vaccinated women, even stated enough research provided women first trimester.  42% quite bit slow spread. importantly, vaccines prevent death hospitalisation effectively. 1000 people dying Indonesia would benefit much vaccines fully vaccinated healthy people US would. 

I problem countries getting fully vaccinated others. Thinking booster shots healthy individuals makes sense risk countries vaccinated completely insane. people get ‚Äúboosted‚Äù common cold Coronaviruses achieved full antigenic drift. past, would keep getting sick colds.

Coronaviruses make small amount viruses cause colds. past research showed almost everybody exposed common cold corona every 18 months provides ‚Äúbooster‚Äù. One theory circulating common-cold Coronaviruses one point epidemic/pandemic similar SARS-Cov-2 first infected humans hundreds thousands years ago. likely conclusion covid-19 pandemic virus eventually become endemic.

The way able time antigenic drift exposing banked blood decades ago blood old new strains virus. serum antibodies reactive strains circulating time banked reactive modern strains virus. basically, someone traveled 20 years He's not. He's asking people wear masks stop spread. He's letting schools businesses require masks protect students patrons. 

He's single thing *stop people catching COVID* - trying get nurses care get sick dying. I‚Äôm sorry hear it. 
Having 3 children, know labor delivery hard enough without lung function necessitates needing vent. brilliant. know people argue ""states rights"" situations like Abbott DeSantis they're actively making situation worse. actions lead deaths help prolong pandemic. 

But since country set 50 small states there's little federal government do. entire system wack. think susceptibility misinformation less generational thing make out. Gen X'ers boomers aware can't trust read internet. people said Wikipedia used source.

I tried see data support point. could find suggested trust internet decreased older suggests millennials likely older generations get news social media unverified sources.

 issue really ""trust internet."" skepticism trust general. Millennials late Gen X'ers [more preceding generations. trend towards trust skews age. 

Anyone used AOL made webpage 1995 realizes easy give platform idiot.

Regarding vaccination, demographic likely unvaccinated [millennials young Precisely aforementioned skepticism. Older people likely trust doctors, scientists, traditional institutions. strong predictors republican uneducated. Hopefully giving baby immunity main reason wanted get vaccine comes. waited end second trimester safe (made sure far enough along mostly done building blocks life growing), zero complications.

To honest, based decisions vaccines based known data fevers pregnancy. fever first months catastrophic baby, risk reasonable, getting vaccine brainer. I'm you. can't forever. Get vaccinated, assess personal risk profile, live life accordingly. Time guarantee. Okay, okay, I‚Äôll give that. lol missed joke mate. cousin (who high statewide medical administration) got Delta. reported extreme fatigue 4 days. 60s ""in shape"". hospital, tubes, crisis. fully vaccinated. THAT'S difference. Get shots folks. states report weekend sites take monday report split back multiple days others leave monday zeros days one group people believe vaccine virus 

Then side thinks covid black plague even vaccine enough save 

The media/govt blame misinformation reporting half truths government mandated it. think current research suggests effectiveness goes time. 

Very fun me, vaccinated September part vaccine trials. I‚Äôll y‚Äôall‚Äôs canary coal mine world generally safe that, pregnancy, mindset simply ""avoid anything harmful"" rather ""weigh costs benefits action."" costs benefits weighed, risks usually suuuuuper tiny somewhat theoretical sides kind unimportant tossup end day.

So faced something sounds kind scary like ""emergency use approved vaccine formally tested pregnant women"" vs. ""getting COVID pregnancy,"" also OB feel empowered make strong suggestion one way other... totally see pregnant women get it. 

Granted, REALLY wanted get vaccine pregnant (gave birth February), understand pregnant women able appropriately weigh risks would treat situation like ""eating deli meat not"" rather serious situation is.   must get jokes every day thought DeSantis banned asking ventilators. personal opinion personal situation, i'd rather wait boosters designed new variants come around rather getting 3rd shot exactly first two messaging mess CDC, though scientific organization hope wake start showing scientific messaging done. One thing would help put efficacy percentage, pair endpoint (symptomatic, hospitalized, etc) along it. 

People looking Israeli percentages many appreciate context. They're testing aggressively country looking Covid zero catching asymptomatic cases left right places US leaders trying cut citizens getting tests even symptomatic closing testing centers. direct comparison numbers wholly unscientific. 

People take low efficacy number freak out. morning read Pfizer Moderna reported 6 month efficacy numbers 84% 93%, respectively. C'mon guys, give endpoint contexts right news articles! Tell us symptomatic case efficacy. Tell us region. Tell us delta yet. 

Further, let's lose perspective make assumptions false equivalency. got Pfizer 6 months ago mean shot 84% chance working nothing all. *IF* breakthrough infection vax still helped build massive army. 16% chance bad sad. 16% chance breakthrough case vaccinated got much better prepared immune response fantastic odds good outcome. like Former Guy governors kiss ring Federal aid comes. This.

The doctors hospitals requesting ventilators caught stupid political game. aren‚Äôt picking choosing lives dies based bias. trying save many lives possible - would expect to. Oh, will. Lots people US would say actors video staged. stupid runs deep US. 

Texas vaccination rate 45% despite fact vaccines widely available 3 months now. past two months rate went 10% past month curve pretty much flat. Apparently, remaining 50% people aged 12 interested getting vaccinated. give 5% people cannot take shot medical reasons. stop trash ""news"" sites putting articles citing dangers vaccine. saw articles last week. I'm starting wonder sinister intent get people vaccinate. guess we‚Äôll wait people nursing homes vaccinated December start dying droves start giving boosters.

We make medical decisions based hysterical catastrophizing redditors. Appreciate work! feel guys. haven‚Äôt done recently, please check wife‚Äôs OB get vaccine. I‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôll interact people end pregnancy/labor; please consider n-95 her. risk profile likely remain high postpartum, particularly weeks immediately following birth. Good luck sympathy world. That's correct, CT value SARS-CoV2 RNA determined PCR. However, CT value converted determine viral load based interpolation known standard curve within PCR run. viral load CT, least US, disclosed patients, negative/positive.

The data I've seen shown infectiousness drops 10 days post-onset symptoms, patients remain PCR positive RNA months. \[[references cited summary key findings agree. Think senior care homes elderly vaccinated back December January. Think healthcare workers vaccinated back December January well. continue call heroes, comes health safety, knowing know waning immunity, well, feels like back days people sew cloth masks enough N95s go around. Only, different now, self inflicted wound, knowing long take boosters get going, lot unnecessary illness. Even impact people sick days, ""mild"" covid breakthrough cases could really impact hospital capacities already stretched thin. let's wait, perfect data, CDC already monitoring real time. Never underestimate selfish people be.

Look autism proponents vaccines. argument literally better dead kids living ones slightly disabled. That's it. course say bluntly gist message. think realize high mortality rate children without vaccines. Take look graph linked. 1800, 46% born children survive see 5th birthday. Advances public health policies outside vaccines certainly contribute drop. However, say vaccines played role There's pretty simple answer this. lockdown locking down, taking action contain virus early. South Korea, Taiwan, China, New Zealand significantly different ways handling this, successful started plans virus spread everywhere. ""impossible stop"" US, UK etc. waited things already far control actually try anything, thought bit lockdown would magically reset things them. dealing ""one person infected unstoppable,"" dealing ""oh thousands infected exponential growth already happening, maybe try something now."" Delta thing even spread aggressively people actively trying avoid - idea nothing could've done bother excuse justify countries completely dropping ball start.  grandfather blamed COVID spikes black people Detroit. lives white suburb got COVID living Florida winter. reason people think significant 99.5% country died covid Maybe, proven yet. Florida Gov: Federal government, GTFO tell do!

Also Florida: Uncle Sam stuff... took entirely long realize meant. üôÑ I‚Äôm sorry family didn‚Äôt love you. done nothing prevent COVID, probably still pandemic - albeit much greater cost terms lives, permanent illness, economic damage.

It's interesting thought think less something took weak, inconsistent, half measures. we'd strong, consistent response throughout would over. National mask mandates, national lock downs financial support strong push vaccines soon available probably happening right now. Want say thing voting lose anyway many brainwashed dumb fucks live walking around spouting Fox news. I'm NYC lots hospitals lose money lot patients make long term therapy similar stuff. old independent hospitals long bought big chains balance loss leaders profitable services Congrats new house! I‚Äôm confused 
So vaccinated back January protection went 

If vaccinated April defense disease still high? performative nature make less dangerous. point undermine federal government's authority comes COVID cast big scary government violating rights. could name least 20 Republicans thing last months clear see successful message midterms. political unfortunately everyone dies given life Presidential aspirations Ted Cruz. Yep, informed consent dog whistle ""extra bureaucracy keep it""

They want herd immunity, want thin herd.  wife gave birth two days ago. three women ward tested positive old toddler? test positive? I'm little worried 3 year old + Covid there's little data children age. Glad consider 500K+ US deaths much happening. level travel warning give florida texas right now? Texassastan Many US states far worse Israel right now. CDC issuing warnings travel Louisiana, Texas Florida? Obviously, nothing. answer person exist? 99.99% people fully vaccinated COVID breakthrough case resulting hospitalization death.

So media local governments following science? vaccinated people still scared something literally almost chance harm?

Why talking booster shots masks?

Get vaccinated fine bout prep scub gear /s guess missed part 615,000 people died. COVID somehow threatened F-35 purchases, maybe rep would actually something useful‚Ä¶ hit point seriously wonder parents actually trying kill kids, actively would get trouble, inaction (think?) get trouble. 

 
I can't think reason many people would risking lives kid(s), *unnecessarily.* Watch graph go like crazy coming weeks amount people willing get fake vaccine card small don‚Äôt matter. course. They're suffering 5 bone spurs.  soon word got infected vaccinated person could spread Covid, that‚Äôs push panic started. doesn‚Äôt even matter contagious less period overall unvaccinated person (because get Covid easier) much less chance getting it, could potentially spread it

I think doesn‚Äôt hurt get boosters safe ahead curve, think current vaccines ineffective far point. media done terrible job vaccines - see article article breakthrough cases like vaccinated people part problem

The media negative whole pandemic. Everything doomsday type coverage. one even thinks fact even delta, vaccines way better could‚Äôve hoped year ago don‚Äôt think covid. live family member test weekly always negative. felt sick second moderna dose. don‚Äôt even want think sick may gotten actually covid. I‚Äôm high risk covid don‚Äôt know affect you. probably discussed time ago, recently found out. 
What's deal Pentagon Microchip thing? Excellent. Need keep pressure rollout.

That‚Äôs still one four people who, whatever reason, double jabbed. Millions jabs still go chance sacred herd immunity. House Reps better. need lose jobs they've done Texas. I‚Äôd say least 90% people saw pool used exclusively. It‚Äôs swim facility available 30 mile radius. It‚Äôs used swim teams, including local high school teams. Also, older folks low impact exercise. Ugh, coworker tell avoiding vaccine might cause fertility issues (even though evidence anywhere supports that), FDA approved, she'll get :\ much happened, except 500K US deaths due Covid. don‚Äôt believe facts straight, 1976 Swine Flu vaccine cause GBS people, deaths perhaps wrongly attributed vaccine. known one reasons people distrust vaccines since. wife 39-weeks pregnant ensure health baby

Are ... father? know pregnant one 39 weeks seems weird say ""her"" baby. paying attention, then. We‚Äôve tried get Cruz now. well loved many Houston republicans. what? don‚Äôt know. Beto best chance thus far came close still wasn‚Äôt enough. able squeeze trip Iceland last month. relaxed travel restrictions I‚Äôm terms incoming testing although needed test reenter US. Right came back, restrictions ramped again. Today CDC designating hot spot. great trip nothing race, everything administration protecting people border   spoke person pregnant women could find president ""Pregnant Screwed"" group?

And case mix messages""? officials clearly said beginning data confirm safety. data enough, urged get vaccinated. ant size attention span? mean are, considered perfectly normal? said going gym? However care hospitals filling up, others getting affected people understand seriousness situation.

Vaccine mandates meaningless US since people lie easily without consequences either gyms need mask mandate need closed given situation today. move outdoors considering weather nice across country. reconsider current wave weeks. Well, forge vaxx card easily. deliberately designed way, even printing QR codes verification forbidden formatted.

I heard several conversations, public, people got fakes. Gotta love working location draws congregations antivaxxer antimasker protests.

Can‚Äôt forge mask face. I‚Äôm pro vax. hope policy forces unwilling people get vaxed.

The gambit though doesn‚Äôt people still vector transmission top staff shortages hospitals.

I friend doctor basically said they‚Äôre understaffed, he‚Äôd rather idiots working idiots running around free time spreading virus anyway. I'm pregnant, 34 weeks, vaccinated. OBGYN suggested waiting 3rd trimester, got first shot (pfizer) 24-26 weeks. I'm sure exactly far along was, felt baby developmentally far enough along ready get immunity.

I zero complications vaccine except sore arm. Baby growing well kicking storm except asleep. weigh born. might short legs, I, lol. case, I'd begging America Russia point come liberate us.   course wife‚Äôs pregnancy, every country including US went process ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know vaccine impacts unborn child mother‚Äù ‚Äúit may beneficial covid don‚Äôt know could present worse long-term effects‚Äù ‚Äúokay yeah vaccine safer getting covid pregnancy‚Äù finally ‚Äúplease get vaccine pregnant.‚Äù journey deal uncertain experts pregnant women getting vaccine, fetal development happens weekly, waiting couple months experts know vaccine‚Äôs safety frustrating. 



Critical thinking deciding medical decision may impact pregnancy, you‚Äôre dealing novel vaccine research weigh options. empathy women I‚Äôve position. lot aren‚Äôt anti-vax, it‚Äôs medical experts weren‚Äôt even clear late spring early summer best course. countries banned pregnant women getting months ago. Winter coming‚Ä¶ Senators statewide it‚Äôs gerrymandering that‚Äôs issue. lot neighbors genuinely like human rat known Ted Cruz.  true pretty much every state surging right now, exclusively Texas.

Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida much steeper curve time around past.  !remindme 14 days counter tail-between-the-legs traumatized people denial evidence showing vaccines better Israel found, choose cherry pick worst evidence justify paranoia. No. Kids considered competent Canada make medical choices. familiar defaming someone render less credible  wonder way connected personal idiot charge - Governor Ron DeSantis, proud member exclusive brainless club Republican Party US. 

You go, DeSantis! Show world brain needed office! need prepare mentally spike children hospitalizations. ballpark expect largest surge hospitalized kids? Lol. course it‚Äôs Obama‚Äôs fault. 
Yeah, 2009 swine flu too‚ÄîI got year. Even virologists epidemiologists acknowledge 1976 Swine Flu scare vaccine disaster caused distrust vaccines government vaccine pushes. immunity mother baby, would serve temporary protection, 6 months, baby developes defenses. Amen. better - prove sinking level. Oh man, Harvey :(
That tough one, friend lived time basically stuck apartment. Texas gets slammed, remember sneaking weather sites Ike wild... 

You need break, friend! broke 2 weeks ago, isolation, feeling like never going end, go school keep home, yeah, I'm done. I've reading books complex PTSD, I'm hot mess üòÇ

I recommend unf*ck brain, really helpful dealing ghosts demons. author Texan, Faith Harper, shall leave caution, salty peppery words! love it! Makes stick nicely steel-trap memory!  shot ? don‚Äôt mind asking cousin nurse ""it causes autism...so get it"" train. Ugh

My mom also keeps saying many kids autistic. (She believes crap well) They‚Äôre anyone vulnerable. Anecdotally, false negative office. us moderna get sick, pfizer did. *oh no*

So anyway...

It‚Äôs almost vaccines might actually worth Basically that.  ones unvaccinated lazy ones couldn‚Äôt bothered, also give excuses excuses‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs mandated, boom, nvm excuses, shot done.  That‚Äôs still 500 kids dead annually. consolation parents whose kid died hospital?

But see rationalized one risk away now?

That‚Äôs point: risk actually higher one hand waved away.  Um...COVID? Yeah pregnant women group unvaccinated adults (besides medically exempt) really sympathy for. Like safe them, feel get shot, *understand* concern. Humans capable making proper decisions benefit community. That's small government conservatives delusional really making excuses selfish wanting told do. it‚Äôs worth, got Moderna side effect sore arm. really varies person person Utterly completely. real? Thought still sincerely ""this fine"" mindframe. end variants. US Covid hot spot currently WORLD. developed nations things better control sending vaccines nations. divert things places running rampant. US source vaccines.

Roughly 50% 320 million US vaccinated. vaccine 42% effective, means 21% population blocking spread virus. numbers still sound great you? ventilator vacation!    know 3 women got vaccinated third trimester delivered healthy babies. friend 24 weeks doctor told get vaccine gets 12 week mark. got Moderna baby great!

Meanwhile, SIL refuses get vaccine believes causes infertility. Apparently friends received vaccine hard time conceiving. Even though infertility, miscarriage, even conception taking completely normal things talk general. evidence happening often due vaccines, refuses listen. 2 kids 3 years old lives high risk state :( Absolutely; hard lockdowns complete inaction bring pandemic faster end plodding along, result weaker measures (but might maximize compliance minimize shock system). 3 additional DLC costumes new scenario added storyline. Let's disingenuous here. Delta Plus great value  much happened schools period essentially shut down? say? Imagine that. can't give honest correct answer w/o posts deleted due political. He's single thing stop people catching COVID - trying get nurses care get sick dying.

And makes wonder he'll able get help.

I'm nurse, tons traveling positions available anywhere -- going cluster fuck place like FL TX desirable?

How much money worth go watch unvaxed people get vented pass away? NY paying $75/hr, go TX $100/hr, like f nonsense.

But maybe I'm nurse insufficiently motivated go place people need badly, nurses think like go. might consequences getting it, nobody forcing anyone.

Exactly. People may find difficult get decent job, attend social functions, etc, nobody forced. incoherent. Oh yeah it‚Äôs hilarious concerning. shit local hospital. One antivax nurse bitching last year lauded heroes, got military flyovers, free food. she‚Äôs ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù losing job doesn‚Äôt get vaccine. 

Never trust person wallows adoration called hero. think people would define heroism involving kind sacrifice ‚Äî getting vaccine that‚Äôs proven safe vast majority recipients like barest, minimal sacrifice. Arguably vaccines we've delivered far big difference last year. one hand, every death since like April preventable. other, vulnerable widely vaccinated point. stay tough follow - maybe even though ok gettinf OTHERS -stay - people - heres tricky part - die. Like lot people die. arent you. many people die - stay - therefore bad take seriously.  register mr anti-vaxxer? No? Space lasers? Jews!? course. Mine (back April) recommended waiting 3rd trimester. waited 25 weeks along.

No complications. Yes, thank you. Dr. Marta Perez specifically great highlight V-Safe data confirmed subsequent testing. 

I used literally science communication doctors listed well OB supportive, help make decision. pregnant August 2020. got vaccinated V-Safe data came 30,000 women mid February, got second dose March. Obviously anecdotal, healthy birth, healthy baby. 

All background rates adverse pregnancy events higher vaccinated population.

The CDC began actively recommending vaccination pregnant women late April. ACOG also changed recommend April specifically recommending pregnant women get vaccinated. sure women still getting conflicting messages physicians, going get killed. Yes. However, small gym old industrial building that's one large room high ceilings three big doors keep open big fans going. Meaning, see people day day good ventilation.

If standard globo gym, I'm sure comfortable I'd feel. happened last year? Chernobyl level. another reason wife wanted get vaccinated pregnant soon possible. newborn immune system get mother womb milk. getting vaccinated, baby getting protection COVID otherwise. second child one-week old now.

We scare last week 2-year-old go hospital croup (horrible barking cough, high fever), symptoms babies/toddlers get respiratory viruses. chance COVID (test came back negative, likely common cold), much less worried newborn's potential exposure knew residual immunity wife vaccinated. specifically mentioned Obama 2009 sadly lol maybe that's meant take ""the primary goal protect person getting vaccinated"" make unjustified leap ""Why care protection infection?"" secondary benefit *typical* vaccinations, *expected* vaccinations. make sound like unexpected important. age 80, expected. 615,000 last saw. 4.2 MILLION across globe. 

People 20s dialysis, probably life. Permanent lung damage. Heart damage. 


If that's nothing, want imagine ""bad"" would chucklefucks. don‚Äôt seems acknowledge kids get long COVID much (per rate incidence) adults do, even original infection asymptomatic. put article point two U.K. studies effect kids took reasons I‚Äôm still clear on. good news we're halfway there. Let's keep up, folks.  Said I'll say again: thing harmless delusion, delusional people rarely stop one delusion.

Religion glorifies idea rejecting truth makes uncomfortable replacing feel good fairy tale instead. really surprise people taught extend mindset rest lives too. live rock ignoring economic collapse, tens millions unemployed, 600k dead, health professionals killing selves quitting work, lack PPE everywhere... comment section though... husband nervous bad reaction vaccine due preexisting conditions. I'm vaccinated pregnant, due 5 weeks.

I've straight told he's allowed hospital he's vaccinated everyone could exposed we're hospital. 18+ months quarantine mean shit get exposed childbirth.

Get vaccinated. Hell yeah brothers, ain‚Äôt real man unless brave blood clot get inferior vaccine 

(I‚Äôm kidding grabbed first one available help get New York vaccinated fast possible don‚Äôt regret anything) second trimester Pfizer side effects included sleepiness sore arm shot. Baby due October can't speak portion except heart rate awesome enjoys daily boxing sessions. :) Make make sense üôÑ Though parents might suddenly rediscover humanity grief feel regret.

Some will, won't. Give weeks. Even crazier, people contagious long. People good spreading virus *really good spreaders*. might   Come man, read headline article thread kids return school, Florida counties report COVID cases four times higher last year even issue all. 4k deaths day? Florida? live AZ bunch nurses outside protesting vaccine mandate news. grandma appointment TMC seeing dumb behavior news we've cancelled it. Blissfully (and especially scientist whore) get fundraising emails. Completely agree. vaccination rates directly correlate education unfortunately.  schools north doing? guess news zero cases anywhere besides Florida Texas Georgia!  feel anything prevent people getting sick, get extra help. feel handled keep doing. Keep ventilators states taking necessary precautions still needing help. 

They ones say pandemic happening. feel anyone vaccinated, feel imaginary problem. say let nature take course. Everyone vaccinated chose outcome. time face results poor decisions. Pretty simple me.  fear it‚Äôs good enough. people faking vaccine cards / tests, vaccinated people able spread disease, delta variant, safe way hold event 100k people close together.  TN always start first week august get summer like may 15-20 area  Nah GOP way.... (except comes Roe v Wade course) ob recommended second trimester (I first discussing it). I'm grateful number people come contact anti vaxxers. good comparison.. even closer mayor forcing kids swim ocean.   work factory setting. pretty much every education level represented here, people GED PhD. 

The proportion anti-vax vaccinated really vary department department. deliver October I‚Äôm going specifically ask vaccinated caregivers. think hospital I‚Äôm delivering already put mandate effect, there‚Äôs always possibility apply exemption.

Your sister same. says teach school. Maybe saw kids really taught? teacher, get vaccinated everything can. lovely students bring sorts wonderful things us. remember encephalitis outbreak school. first line, baby! :) minor side effects, any... but, better life long morbidity.... stop fighting proven measures help reduce spread. they're supporting politician.

I bet proud move kid front seat soon unreasonably possible, rite passage fear PTSD actual science small body accident. Front faced em 6 months?  end goal

For US? getting vaccination rates past 70%, everyone seems forgotten that, even CDC government. seems big motivation treat vaccinations like group effort, huge departure previous vaccination campaigns treated. give 4 weeks everything‚Äôs shut again. sort thing makes huge difference return high risk activities. Based numbers things like high school wrestling, combat sports can't afford island, things masks compatible likely still risky. Back Pfizer vaccine 99 percent effective happily training gym, Delta 85% effective Pfizer ass back couch anti-vax teammates improving. average person mask literally anything would normally great, though. Absolutely.

And anyone exempt due say religion x,y,z, work online. Porque Los tres?  links posted almost mRNA Covid vaccine studies, largest study (with 35,700 participants) handful Johnson Johnson recipients.

Isn‚Äôt expectation Covid eventually become common endemic disease? analogy I‚Äôve heard experience covid-19 could expected influenza novel pathogen first encounter us. would cut swath death terrible initial pandemic, nearly everybody many vaccinated, lethality would subside (it‚Äôs near lethal you‚Äôre vaccinated or, suspect, you‚Äôve already it) would primarily mortal threat elderly medically vulnerable, like flu.

Surely, intentionally misinterpreting available information. I, honestly, don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre willfully ignorant. think school systems failed many ways, critical thinking one.

It course question long lasts brings autumn. Yeah article specifically stated 25% spike staying localized distributed bloodstream throughout body within hours potentially harming organs tissues. 

Again, trying give credit, I'm honestly curious want know others thoughts/research suggest.

Here's article headline: Researcher: ‚ÄòWe Made Big Mistake‚Äô COVID-19 Vaccine lot people cheering America donating 100 million vaccines it‚Äôs fantastic fairness lot make for. really problem that. health maybe lives line, need communicate current situation clearly, assure people wanting additional protection access quickly possible. Phew, thats relief!  Pretty much drugs pregnancy category c meaning potential benefits outweigh risks. enough data assess (it‚Äôs unethical studies) it‚Äôs hedge saying think it‚Äôs safe anything bad happens it‚Äôs decide. I‚Äôve given lots different drugs pregnant women porofessional opinion, benefits covid vaccine tremendously outweigh risks severe lung damage, icu admission, low oxygen insults baby. get votes. followers love stuff whatever takes vote since goes grain.  Everyone unless you‚Äôve got damn good reason be. Well least guys fighting well. hope experience gets better &amp; fast recovery Source NY CA economies ""destroyed""? It‚Äôs crazy uneven is. state New York, averaging 9 deaths day. Texas 58 Florida 122. That‚Äôs ridiculous. Glad 2-year old got tested! cousins child diagnosed croup November known exposure (mother father already tested positive later childcare provider -Grandma- tested positive)...

Doctor later agreed probably Covid still test him! force medical records case long-term effects. 

Then doctor tried blame getting one nurses infected. üôÑ Disable Javascript.  Damn that's well said.  breakthrough infections rare enough, enough big deal put resources tracking reporting. Focus needs hospitals unvaccinated Considering nature job close proximity they'll covid patients, ""antivax nurse"" problem solve pretty soon, provide job openings sane nurses!   Fauci deliver ventilators personally. Boom! Good, responsible public health. Nope (28) vaccinated April, bf (27) day, sister law (23) month ago, little brother (25) got first dose recently. COVID right now. got Pfizer. Delta gets regardless got vaccine- none us deathly ill headaches slight coughs fatigue.  Delta results 1000x viral RNA compared earlier variants. similar sized outbreak would look considerably worse wastewater evaluation. current Texas outbreaks aren‚Äôt major concern. doesn‚Äôt seem match data I‚Äôve read anywhere He‚Äôs busy fighting imaginary border war created. almost reminds movie Canadian Bacon [It's already crazy enough talking death graph? Pleading vaccinated people stay home going mitigate brink collapse. That's point. feel like messages misdirected. Truth^ husband works education he's heard similar rumors, idk, trust anything anymore. ACOG SMFM recommended it. available last year pregnant, would‚Äôve gotten it. is, got breastfeeding newborn. We‚Äôre healthy! Please get vaccinated Vaccine mandates public workers (especially working around kids) starters. right people got damn vaccines. 100% 100% agree, jobs requiring right work way public. point UK currently fixed Covid booster plan, preparations way *if* goes ahead, final decision made. urgency return school lol..

""Do kneel Trump let take place claim right House Speaker?""  fair, hes wrong hahaha, kids disgusting. mean, fault know better, still.  Damn dude works Good, need use tools fight this! 34% cdc estimated total number people covid, tested postitive.

I looked updated 36% - estimate (again, post based older 34% number)

What wrong math?  don‚Äôt know extent virulent delta virus differs virus strain, trust professionals‚Äô opinions guidance. Pesky thing called 1st amendment. /s 

Seriously tho, 1st amendment allow run theater yell fire. apply misinformation spreaders pandemic. Anything possible really great argument, especially unlikely happen  counties started school today Florida. much work paste Wikipedia I'm sorry man. worked retail pandemic uncommon occurrence sadly. store would even actively encourage people get tested extreme close proximity people fill missing shifts. 

I centrist leaning right reguarding businesses whole thing, needless say pandemic drastically shifted perspective Feels like long say situation never really going get better. wonder people dodge pfizer boosters. AZ intranasal vaccine (that essentially identical intramuscular one) good preclinical data. Chinese adenovirus vaccine good clinical (phase 2) data. think see intranasal vaccine next year. put ‚Äú/s‚Äù sarcastic mostly. didn‚Äôt say variant completely evades vaccines, possibility. eligible people work schools kids could required vaxxed. High quality, well fit masks could required everyone. could daily testing everyone. 

There‚Äôs lot could done, isn‚Äôt. many places aren‚Äôt even trying. Desantis still threating Schools salary reductions require masks? remove reasonable amount shots people decline provide ID insurance info. Match names DOB existing databases, match, throw out. suddenly 30% ppl decline provide id compared 5% months ago, throw out. like statistics want steal third jab entitled to

Nope, lives saved usually folks comorbidities, LIVING folks comorbidities getting booster shot. Especially 6 months.  Got kids getting ready start 4th grade kindergarten. thought rolling virtual school makes cringe. goddamn shame.  Godspeed friend.  Trudeau basically one win left, need hand reigns someone else Cons get 2025. take big question, seem grooming Chrystia Freeland heir apparent. But....I thought vaccine made unable get pregnant! /s really, really hope lagging deaths spike hard winter, people vaccinated cases skew towards younger populations risk death infection.

But delta variant different experiencing last winter, heck knows! send kid school Florida I'd pissed.  like 15 years ago, envy Florida. always want kind lifestyle.

but 2016 2020, changed mind. Florida sucks. yes could 20x better, probably best state USA, nope, give Florida enough love turning shithole state. fuckin gross hell

You sound like real treat yourself. Yeah, reason whatsoever. /s

The benevolent China throwing tantrum Japan donated AstraZeneca Taiwan. mayor seeking protect constituents overthrown? weird logic cases contracted school (5 days incubation). following weeks determine cases transmitted school. necessary. free lunches. Republicans tell themselves.   long one doctor million agrees you, never question whether right. Convenient. *Angry Jeff Bridges rant* would tend agree florida also open exact numbers certain days. even dates cited match cdc reported days explanation ""cdc combined multiple dates one"" work mathematically. 

let produce numbers daily see what's going  also asthma, really hard. mostly mental block people. open mouth wide breathing mask. would completely fuck national data? like there's bum rush million people rushing get 3rd dose.

Also, statistically analyze, remove portion shots people decline submit ID , insurance info get reasonable accurate picture.

In case, since info coming 3rd dose needed, saving lives better theoretical 'fucking national data'. Send church pray. articles making continue. Wear making continue:

‚ÄúThere ventilators, yours‚Äù - son-in-law couldn‚Äôt even pass security clearance plenty sick need hospitalization. also spread others. get long term health complications.

Well interesting see happens. fact checking     Nobody 12 great solution right now. thought standard claim they're carcinogenic I'm HS principal VA sitting call State vaccination coordinator Danny Avula. mentioned fully expects emergency use approval kids 5 11 sometime next month. Clearly he'd know thought pushed back. still case? I'd think positive development schools society general.  ok, taking anything shady site half seriously already mistake :D specially corona, unbiased information hardly exists all.

I can't talk numbers really clue. corona, matters change trends. Excessive hospital admittance, excessive deaths, excessive miscarriages vaccinated comparing vaccinated? Since can't talk real numbers take problematic. I'll leave that.  Come Santa Clara County.  80% fully vaccinated, bullshit health officials. population submission

Submission exactly? dying due contagious disease? Like exactly think accomplished getting people vaccinate except vaccinations? vaccinated polio, chickenpox myriad life threatening diseases babies.

Speak yourself. I'm father three never six kids vaccinated babies. Israel like 90% vaccinated? Level 4 (Very High) India Level 3 (High)? LOL @ China Level 1 (Low); yeah, okay.  Closing schools due outbreaks won‚Äôt improvement. Eventually you‚Äôll run substitute teachers many kids once.  Ah yes, simultaneously deny Covid deadly also requiring governments aid deadliness. going back school mid August? facts insanity guess.  happy protected everyone around.  upset mild inconvenience thats helping stay active alive

Weird much anti mask sentiment coronavirus sub Yeah VA 55% 12-17 crowd least shot plus masks school districts 8 days since Lolla ended locally I've seen huge increase. Chicago averaging 100 cases day last week time, attribute general rise delta variant rather festival (the rest state significantly worse). think cases happen result festival, believe going huge spike cases result festival. I'm glad hear festivals requiring proof vaccination/negative testing. Whats stupid morons know 1 4 pregnancies end miscarriage. here. moved CT VA started day Labor Day places. wife TN started good month us. flip side, school lets mid June VA mid May TN. sure why.  Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted ‚ÄúThe FDA approve covid vaccines‚Äù ‚Äútoo many reports infection &amp; spread #COVID19 among vaccinated people.‚Äù

If whole fucking county covid nobody dying it, fucking cares? Totally.

Maybe virologist comment that's experience 40+ years I've planet. pass cost onto voluntarily unvaccinated instead onto everyone? usual, Israel ahead curve.

Other western countries plenty supply now, held back sclerotic, overly cautious, public health institutions reason recommending boosters anyone.

That's standard precautionarily language. I've got baby meds tell talk doctor administering x age. doc says sure, safe baby. anticipate situations age x could dicey way age, hence getting medical professional weigh in.

Nearly 90% adults first dose approximately 94% adults antibodies.  conservatives become afraid everything? mean, like find new thing terrified every day need protect side it. government hunting children vaccine dart guns, chill fuck out. hard objective situation. Delta clearly contagious, kids get sick, even one every 1,000-10,000 kids get serious effects, multiplying total number cases result serious cases. 

I really wish FDA would approve vaccines kids, parents want peace mind want kids return normal life so. Israel study flawed - I'd call even one ""worrying"" but, I'm monster... midwife cautious recommend first study time, told figured would ok get like vaccines pregnant folks. soon one study came Washington put pregnant people priority list like: ""GO! GO! GO!"" haha

So got right end first trimester. lady giving vaccine seemed hesitant tho, asking doctor ok everything lol mean, narly Delta is. folks vaccinated (probably like 50% Texas). summertime. likely degree mask wearing. 

And yet...here are. Hospitals getting filled stretched breaking point. 

I imagine bad would strain hit us originally winter months. market touring power, that's I'm set for. ways make audio sort work. there's shows physically power. Either way, lot idle equipment right now. 

Hopefully government starts sort serious incentive program people start getting vaccinated.  Sounds like migrant vaccine rates better Texans.... No. say no. willful idiots need learn. wife got vaccinated pregnant. recommended every doctor talked to. Plus studies show infants carry antibodies months least born. Can't wait big hospitals mandate it. 

See long antivax nurses hold lol. doctor. This. Especially residency.  libs owned yet? speak Iowa, got J&amp;J Hy-vee March able get Pfizer Walgreen's month. website sign-up even ask J&amp;J, Pfizer/Moderna even dishonest. ""Let's vaccinate brown people reasons""

Come on. Try even harder. friend END... must new anti-vax crowd. always Doctors ready peddle non-sense see conspiracy threads.

did forget pharmacist wisconsin intentionally left vaccines storage space thrown out? accurate say mode 0. pretty hard average zero.  Govenor said nothing worry about? He's got control right? Right? Riiiiiiight?!!! Wrong.

It opens first, fever, July 25, four quiet days convalescing home, ribs began hurt. next day, Villarraga took emergency room, chest X-rays revealed Sophia developed pneumonia. soon began coughing blood.

Then continues Hospitals coronavirus hot spots particularly hard hit. single day last week, Arkansas Children‚Äôs Hospital, Little Rock, 19 hospitalized children COVID; Johns Hopkins Children‚Äôs Hospital, St. Petersburg, Florida, 15; Children‚Äôs Mercy Kansas City, Missouri, 12. multiple children intensive care unit.

And clear confluence factors ‚Äî including delta‚Äôs contagiousness fact people 12 yet eligible vaccinated ‚Äî sending children hospital, especially areas country virus surging.  

And  number positive COVID tests started climb early July,‚Äù said Marcy Doderer, president CEO Arkansas Children‚Äôs Hospital. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs really started see kids get sick.‚Äù

I guess ""no"" talking about:  15 children COVID-19 inpatients Children‚Äôs Hospital New Orleans late last week, four ‚Äî including 3-month-old baby ‚Äî intensive care, said Dr. Mark Kline, hospital‚Äôs physician chief. None children, including eight old enough eligible, vaccinated.


Try harder, denier. bad, better ones available fewer side effects.  keeps saying 30% immigrants refusing vaccine far 55% Texans refuse. Saw doc qualified talk stuff say Delta's screwing thought knew Covid, guidelines like. Like know passed surfaces right -- going get mail, groceries. Seems like close indoors proximity. Large outdoor protests feared would superspreader events weren't. think know Covid Delta's different. transmissible, higher viral load, even vaxxed spread it. kind go back early covid precautions dial back determine what's overkill. 

It still drives nuts find could nixed whole thing without shutting economy wore masks, one thing idiots wanted keep everything open do.    Props Arkansas doctor! mention might given you! viral encephalitis 

Sure - want everyone careful garbage 1-off stories - here's example right shows doctors over-including encephalitis cases been.

This doctor may correct diagnosis - encaphalitis usually caused viral infections - question - less likely COVID-19 compared common  general politicians immune negative outcomes policies push official capacity government employee. sue government, politician.  last time I‚Äôll explain you, I‚Äôll simplify much understand.

Just going twirling moustaches saying ""hahaha going spread Iibs!"" mean share responsibility. They're killing people indirectly. like collateral damage really. Millions donated doses already wasted sub-Saharan countries, primarily anti-vax beliefs also absolutely awful infrastructure. 

Lots countries around world sufficient infrastructure demand, lousy politicians prefer let people meet huge groups religious reasons focus getting enough vaccines timely manner. countries, delivery 100s thousands expensive vaccines would targeted terrorists, stolen, fought over. Still countries want debt foreign powers. Here's thought.

Not good one. Oh I'm sure will, I'm guessing gotten bill yet.   ask people continue conceiving.

To looks like FL DOH changed reported numbers, didnt communicate well enough CDC (if all) tried pin problem CDC.

Its also curious FL DOH big mad CDC over-reported cases 24,150 dont care CDC under-reported cases points.

If conspiracy nut I'd say FL DOH trying help Governor stirring doubt CDC numbers distract bad numbers (and Govs polling numbers) are. States like FL TX get help without consequences. Obviously, want people dying governors legislatures put active measures place minimize spread. FL spend X amount money actively trying get people vaccinate, example.

Fuck asshole GOP nuts. know say whatever want without consequences. also know Dems federal government help matter taking advantage. Remember Trump wouldn;t send money CA?

I mean, it‚Äôs even insane take blaming another country‚Äôs minority party, never know nowadays.  information makes respect Disney employees even more. hell job!  as....?

United States America. Take tyrannical bullshit Europe. P.S. take papers lambda saw post, seems paper month ago seems suggest vaccines hold fine Lambda variant. thread here: want SHRUBBERY! ^(to hide bodies.) Oh yeah. couple individuals head scratchers work don‚Äôt choice. Dealing immunocompromised patients leaves zero room error. It‚Äôs vaccination highway clinic/ might argue ""somehow"" part, unless used ironically, otherwise spot on. That's awesome. Obviously wish paid better treated employees better, many ways experience working Disney going fantastic. lot regulars there's lots camaraderie. customers super happy there, there's excitement air. wish cousin best. right proud ‚Äî going lead great things. It‚Äôs hard believe isn‚Äôt it? don‚Äôt see get past knowing people really think act. People I‚Äôve seen last years school sports. I‚Äôll never look same. course, choose vaccinated, also choosing assume risk?

Why anyone concerned? Rosier picture. Turns lot Israeli data looking places 95% vaccine rates unvaccinated infect. numbers lot clearer Delta spread pockets unvaccinated. 2 smaller kids (1st + 3rd) fine 3 hours day. done. Well let's see data data also show giving people first dose (in poorer countries) much giving people 3rd dose space 10 months. can‚Äôt require masks? president executive order way 4 years. election covid disappear! want Trump look bad! way  No, it‚Äôs violation say hi, deal people crossing deaths door, attachment becomes much strong patient nurse.

Just past weekend ran grandmother facing death sentence due prognosis children‚Äôs science museum. introduced us family husband started crying thanking wife compassion comfort provided since family isn‚Äôt allowed treatment clinic. bonds people form nurses doctors quite life altering, sometimes nurses speck light sea darkness. COVID impacted everyone‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs even harder people go chemo radiation alone. Family aren‚Äôt allowed right clinic it‚Äôs patient, nurse, doctor. People still unsure despite CDC's statement.   I‚Äôm you. really struggling. can‚Äôt wait vote Joe Cunningham 2022. government get nut wear mask. 

Oooohh yeah!!! Control!!!! Yeah, lot education difference RN LPN CNA. Meanwhile, 146 new deaths, highest number since 12 March. mean like Florida Governor threatening deny salary pay school officials require ""No MRI"" tattoo, metals make MRI dangerous? Would heeded emergency?  two factors play here: 

* Florida's state ban school mask mandates.
* Increased Transmission Delta

There [pretty show least last year's variants, in-person education low transmission rates long everyone wearing masks. 

So, question is, much transmission due students masking, much due increased transmission rate Delta variant? 

As parent kids school district that's headed back in-person-with-masks-required school weeks, hope masks still effective enough allow safe in-person learning under-12s get vaccinated. really know yet. There's definitely technology ways (such cross-referencing valid ID ""SMART Health Card"" (QR code),.. many US States already doing. 

The problem becomes ""implementing EFFECTIVELY"".. especially across diverse population attendees.. many may Digital ""SMART Health Card"" provide paper vaccination card. 

The venue would way query States database.. think there's centralized way that. 

This (yet again) one life situations ""Possible"" versus ""practical"". right. alone agreed everything said, probably make difference. However, strongly believe vast majority people agreed said, would turn fucking fire anyone knew getting vaccinated. ""I got mine"" attitude, might feel compelled push people orbit IRL get theirs. I'm talking social pressure/relational organizing. Hardly anyone fucking website change opinions anonymous stranger talking shit. 10 users repeat disinformation feeds biases irrational fears. need say this. I'm surrounded skeptics Florida I'm starting get annoyed.

You generate type data virus without 100% certainty exists. wake watch news chills spine ""a hoax.""

I sign genomics pandemic even *occurred* good reason. want someone read know *understand* like, first global pandemic people can't wrap heads around it. Hey that‚Äôs reddit haha 

I don‚Äôt think people quite understand dire staffing right places.  majority Brazil vaccinated Sinovac (CoronaVac), Sinopharm 2nd widely distributed vaccine Argentina (after Sputnik). mandate surge ends, what? one US seems want talk plan it. School start another 2 weeks VA though. Agree, VA higher % vaccination younger people overall. doubt you, I'm looking something credible cite. I'm sure understand age misinformation need confirming something passing along truth. Well, vaccine isn‚Äôt ‚Äúrequired‚Äù everywhere neither masks‚Ä¶. point is: wouldn‚Äôt someone educator willing get protected another illness? Getting second Friday too, snap! sister/mother idiots brothers got theirs. guess us don‚Äôt Facebook account? 

Congrats right thing.  emerge even get vaccinated that's Delta variant got here.

ummm delta variant first detected india last October last checked countries besides china russia giving vaccines time. delta vaccines. doesn‚Äôt work there‚Äôs option D: thongs pears. Yeah brainer people field people vacinnated. 
Truly people serious probkems. unvaccinated dealing public ‚Äî firefighters, nurses, teachers, etc. - even acceptable, crazy. Completely irresponsible part reason many people still hesitant return ‚Äú normal ‚Äú. get novax variant? Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

My wife waiting research, reaches 3rd trimester.  quite say he's hesitant take vaccine, though. He's right last administration ton damage politicizing government institutions. Delta showing higher rates hospitalization children. Using cumulative stats whole pandemic equate current risk. Dude even like kids I'm fuming. people effectively stop abortions draconian laws, they're sending kids giant petri dishes without even option vaccination. makes blood boil. sorry, 5 year old supposed start kindergarten week state laws mask mandates. wanted vaccinated badly didnt keep home another year. disappointing scary terrible knowing best disrupted little lives are. hope soon ):  ""and state ban school mask mandates vaccines available schoolchildren.""

Okay, wait, what!? say state banned wearing mask public places? miss something? seems counter productive... Florida thing do.  Connecticut alright. get saying, matching cruelty cruelty makes people suffer. not? That‚Äôs definition Freedom! seems like whenever try talk loved one ( states anyway) getting vaccinated typically get lashed at. discouraging. people closest get defensive I'm trying show concern health. That's actually air. Papers pre-print servers duking out. saw one said viral loads actually lower, another said viral loads diminish faster vaccinated people. would anyone wear anything flip flops Florida? wore everyday Florida never got sent office  Google pulling showed 0 cases 8/8 0 cases 8/7. 56k includes cases day(s). seems a/unlikely light many many virologists said b/bizarre messaging trying get many people vaxxed possible. already fence, would bother head CDC says likely pointless?

Except outliers, pandemic basically us. think places reporting shot administered, residence person. garbage. even remotely reliable source, dude bitching mandates. I'd bet vast majority actually double jabbed. age people dying really changed much, nearly every elderly person UK double jabbed now. deaths likely elderly age group, likely fully vaccinated saying is, Covid breaks snickering laughing like weasels Framed Roger Rabbit, immune system holds finger decides huge fucking bat Harley Quinn mallet. recent email got said one would scheduled week, gave concrete trial start date frustrating. know need ducks row approval get things started, basic communication would nice.

I‚Äôm constantly trying reach Kaiser vaccine study center luck Rapid antigen tests known less sensitive nucleic acid tests, especially early infection prior symptoms. thought time ‚Äúpersonal responsibility.‚Äù 1) deaths \*reported\*; (as always) actually occurred several days. Tuesday figures nearly always highest admin reasons.

2) Yes, highest figure time, 146 population 66.65 million, fully opened three weeks (with significant opening two months that). really promising UK's future many countries, detract achievement stated OP. Almost everyone needs one chose get vaccine. ones dying aren‚Äôt eligible/are breakthrough infections minimal. Probably less respiratory viruses. anyone florida recently catch Delta? Going disneyworld next week (staying week) 7 fully vaccinated adults, planning wearing masks times, outdoors indoors safe wonder else avoid catching every comment read ""I came back tested positive"" LOL sort real GDP growth rate, three middle pack, CA NY higher per capital GDP, states stricter less strict measures noticeable grouping.

COVID measures affect economy. Florida letting vulnerable populations die nothing. usually ~22 day lag curve increasing cases curve increasing deaths. 22 days ago, cases 1/4 now. Even people go hospital, typically drop dead right away, takes time progress. hopefully, pointed below, survival rate higher since average age people hospital younger. expect see deaths rise substantially next weeks. Think said. 3 hours third grader. Virtually. announcement little effect what's reported state level. still mostly - feel good, go get tested, heckers positive get added day's total cases. Case numbers always overwhelmingly symptomatic cases. small proportion tests people getting tested regularly. Gosh bet need everyone responsible gotten vaccinated basically increases deductible 'what have?' Exactly. Children small adults conditional, people opted dependants wear seat belts, nobody else needs part you‚Äôre flying projectile 80 miles hour.

This matter. Texas-sized screw-up! saw too, saw Germany approving use pregnant women, used influence choice. serious question: personally invested proving Covid killing children? 

Since wrote comment last week, dozens articles suggesting likelihood Delta indeed affecting children original strain Covid did. Yet still, insisting true. What's that?   deniers going move goal post many people dying? first people hospital.. age well. actually 56k new cases yesterday. 28k rolling 7 day average. Even high school didn‚Äôt AC still. horrible. know article question quoting CDC numbers - Monday data teacher, completely agree. Ted Cruz ever let opportunity massive piece shit pass by? point I'm numb man... Well think go back school. need masks vaccinated 12 older. Hello fellow vaccinated Houstonite Also, even think they've drawn attention shift recommending vaccine pregnant women. made mind get NS still ""we know effects talk doctor"" website, idea started recommending checked website weeks later curiosity. z e n Related: 'Delta plus' variant? escape vaccines? expert Nope, vaccine recommended children age last month. sister husband got vaccinated back May, get 14 year-old vaccinated last month. 

If everyone eligible get vaccinated done though dealing serious outbreak kid might never gotten exposed. least five year old died freedom intact. exactly rationalize it. Though parents might suddenly rediscover humanity grief feel regret.

T Man, fuck Montgomery County. I‚Äôve adverse reactions vaccines past like ones get children get flu shot. long side effect isn‚Äôt anaphylactic death deal others lol.  see China seems going zero Covid. I‚Äôm wondering going level around 50-70% population vaccinated? going keep rest getting infected forever? point proven electricity situation well! Well there's solution... give permission lock it, .... promise stay quarantine period time break promise, lock (which btw article say, seal home break quarantine, mean initially lock up) Florida...""We want government telling us do'.... understand every one Florida thinks way. continue support this...  $286/hour would tempting many vaccinated workers. SIL's plan same... got covid 38 weeks. already something want move forward with, wait delivery. think anyone happy govt handling it. NZ poster child controlling terms deaths many vaccinated? like horrendous project never ends nobody ever 'lessons learned' exercise. Given probably going Covidland another couple years, high time did.  bootstraps? fucking mutt asking state help attended unmasked superspreader event UFC 265 Houston past Saturday night. guy wants simultaneously lead know nothing anti vaccine anti mask wing party asking outside help due folly. stand corrected. vaccine widely available UK well though. Showing ID done anything unless got first 2 shots Walgreens well. 

They dontnhave access state immunization tracking system (I'm aware state would). submit info system, can't access system business use.  I'm well aware that. Geographical location change current scientific findings, discussed CDC link. state‚Äôs hospital system could handle level ongoing covid catastrophe.

But state hospital system could weathered much higher percentage people vaccinated mask mandates mass gathering rules enforced. Last last March multiple friends nurses pregnant December/January. got shot babies born antibodies! Geo Politics cruel mistress. think already got next day hopefully it‚Äôs less problems vaccinated Never underestimate power stupid people large numbers‚Ä¶sadly, affecting everyone time. Vaxxed Texan, understand people day age fkn dumb‚Ä¶and ‚Äúviolation rights‚Äù BS‚Ä¶seriously? Nobody holding gun heads. Private institutions right mandate vaccine mask don‚Äôt like fk quit. right‚Ä¶To total fool. don‚Äôt get anymore. Lots folks behaving like 3rd world illiterates‚Ä¶everyone claims expert, conspiracies, etc. It‚Äôs appalling. Texas beyond. meanwhile, rotten news networks make 0 attempts educate create something meaningful educate less educated basics‚Ä¶instead, let‚Äôs continue report numbers covid deaths infections 24/7. think challenge people assume hear updates updates. Everybody involved working hard make sure done safely. 

Some people groups different levels acceptable risks (of complications) others, sometimes willing accept higher level risk making decision without facts (as case AAP) stress, anxiety, desperation. think there's much focus wearing masks. Looking research, average mask worn people absolutely nothing help. Even large contaminated water vapor particles contained cough sneeze, blasts sides. thought regards every little bit containment helps relation protecting others necessarily true delta. poor choice average person's mask type wear them, along dirty worthless adds false sense security.  
I've personally witnessed whole departments get covid diligently wearing masks times. incorrectly worn, dirty gaping masks nothing stop spread. One technician cute little mask barely covering beard, nearly killed two people felt comfortable letting paint spots office.  
There way away virus...people must must must get vaccinated immediately. took moderna times laid feeling like worst flu ever experienced. bones hurt. second shot even worse.  two days first shot 3 days second. felt like gave covid.  still get booster. Texas‚Äôs Governors joke almost throughout state‚Äôs entire history. Political ignorance corruption get punished there.  I'm US citizen Germany planning fly back California (SF) visit family two weeks mid September. situation seems stable regions atm, what's trend right now? What's chance numbers would skyrocket coming month? mind reschedule, biggest concern infecting \~70 y.o. parents. thought DeSantis control? Earth would need anything? Interesting, dad age group. got vaccinated soon could, back March. think mentioned grandma knowing people polio important relationship internet. 

Don't get twisted I've jaded internet cultivating sense intelligent skepticism years main thing drove get vaccinated developing chronic illness late 20s. I'm recovered lost lot time due that. 

I mistrust development process vaccines sure knowledge could another bout long term illness got covid prompted get vaccinated. 

Early pandemic still hope community spread could prevented, US citizens quarantined military bases. never visit Mexico criteria. DOZENS regrets reading thread. option Pfizer Moderna chose...Pfizer. /fml  Must lazy journalism. Thanks! 

\- Vaccinated Houston Resident üíØ this.  It‚Äôs like saying ‚Äú99.99% humans killed atomic bomb blasts WW2. It‚Äôs meaningless.  Heard blurb news night higher Texas hospital. said nurses agencies asking something like $235/hour. I‚Äôm exactly sure average hourly wage is, I‚Äôm assuming least 4-5 times average wage pre-pandemic? sore arm first one, bad body aches, sleep 2nd one day half. definitely brain fog day really reminded want Covid brain fog! fine. pleasant maybe that's reved up. needed I'd again. &lt;- Born Texas, living Alberta. confirm. So, insurance allowed billed cost appointment. However, insurance, person allowed billed. recoup costs (or profits), places little overly aggressive asking insurance information, scares people away. issue insurance found system went mine, huge headache, even though actually needed. non-equivalency. feel like already starting happen:

""assuming don‚Äôt variant emerge pierces immunity offered prior infection vaccination""

It's yet, though epsilon lambda definitely concerning. efficacy going wrong direction. feel like going assumption vaccine immune variant already emerged.

And think we're going get 75% fully vaccinated nationwide. reading 44,000 additional deaths. Apparently misunderstood. every one lives US would've thunk. almost year.. feel people can't get vaccinated yet medical reasons age. seriously eligible people choose covid vaccine.. time let die.

Indeed. made question existing beliefs regarding build long lasting stable society benefit all. feel side effects less compared people univalent shots (Pfizer/Pfizer --- Moderna/Moderna)? know comparison, based people's reports side effects either vaccine shots, feel less severe severe?  hey! least they're reporting now!

/s + /smh best friend sister pregnant right vaccine fine. Definitely get shot mama! Getting covid dealing side effects worse newborn. Congratulations good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è states say no. TX refused anything slow spread. made mess, deal it. Historians write truth damn enough distance event. left Texas 2011 glad. stupid crap too, nearly level. thing miss good thunderstorms. health care staff run many additional ventilators? one dumb us! I'd love to, unfortunately think strain first defined Korea. Seminole County enacted something closer mandate weekend. require masks students don‚Äôt submit written request parents seeking exclusion mandate. 

Yeah, it‚Äôs big loophole, it‚Äôs better before. family didn‚Äôt choice, send kid school, opted virtual option year we‚Äôd withdraw gifted school, would put lottery get back again, it‚Äôs extremely difficult get in.

Meanwhile Desantis‚Äô kids mask-requiring private school. California getting too, sigh.

Waiting fairy give PTO shot isn‚Äôt happening. got bunch stimulus money, even undocumented. Labor demand bosses kill career side effects. Get shot contribute surge. You‚Äôre exactly right ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù. Even kid hospitalized dies, there‚Äôs sizable portion fundamentally change. seems really stupid needs Florida sore arm Pfizer REALLY sore arm Moderna. Like, move. felt like shot. got 2nd dose June 23rd left arm still hurts little. patient child, informed consent parent guardian. 

It amazing parent deny children medical care. country Florida seems fine according compassionate president, sure they'd need outside assistance. realize jails/prisons employ large number staff? yet, though epsilon lambda definitely concerning. efficacy going wrong direction. feel like going assumption vaccine immune variant already emerged.

Well, lambda said controlled easier Delta, epsilon much information about, need think fear. vaccine immune variant may come indeed, even know variants changing speed unbeatable vaccines, far looks like ain't case. get wrong, saying wrong speculation something need take reason. loading dart guns shooting will.

This half bad idea! /s worth, vaccinated second trimester. baby 8 weeks old, absolutely amazing. healthy meeting milestones, etc. Also, vaccinated tested negative, nurses felt comfortable around let deliver without mask. (Rules different different hospitals, obvs.) CDC says, almost children catch RSV first two years life. babies born shortly pandemic may encountered RSV usually would have, meaning they‚Äôre extra susceptible now.""

This meant said isolating children protect covid would lot negative effects  Great news! I'm happy someone advocate her. fuck supposed it? literally could  
short loading dart guns shooting  
their will.

I mean...  small sample size, problematic studies. Even CDC going Israeli stats reason. 

If CDC hesitant make decisions based Israeli study 2 weeks ago, blast others same. one skeptical significant uptick vaccinations FDA clears it? RemindMe! 6 months read ""oh shit"" No. think many people already vaccinated less likely die fear aspect completely gone idiots aren‚Äôt vaccinated there‚Äôs way would cooperate. literally true, im indonesia also got astrazeneca covax used even every single western nation advised it. also waiting pfizer shipments coming months. reason indonesia used sinovac vaccinations one available big numbers, imported locally manufactured. 

This article fucked many levels another propaganda piece justify vax disparity worldwide. Sorry, border opening makes nervous.  


I mean, still dealing Alberta's insane stupidity, need outside help fucking things further. :( 

&amp;#x200B;

If coming back, please be, get, vaccinated safe! Make Desantis go TV ask them‚Ä¶.. got Florida health‚Äôs Twitter‚Ä¶..when Florida accused cooking books case counts.  stat? read disappointing amount avoided shot.   got knocked day half. night gotten shot ran 102 fever. Symptoms basically gone next night.  ""potential""

No, keyword ""extremely negative"". we're already seeing evidence long term issues, even though we've studying short time. like rather stick head sand (or, likely, ass) long term also ""potential"" next Bezos

You don't. It‚Äôs even straight 1 1 swap patients.  

A heart attack might traditionally require icu bed couple days. vented covid patient could couple weeks.  1 person covid isn‚Äôt blocking 1 heart patient ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre blocking 7 8. got pregnant early February (2021), found March. OB consensus vaccination pregnant left me, chose wait delivery. 

I positive covid test end April admitted May 1st oxygen sats 91-92 recommended pregnant 95. started bleeding day admittance (13 weeks) stopped hours later babies heartbeat strong 147 bpm. stayed 3 days released oxygen stabilized. Within 4 days rapidly deteriorated home came back, sats tanking went needing 2 oxygen ER maxing room air antepartum 10 ICU 45% oxygen 9 hours. stayed ICU oxygen maintenance another 3 days able step back room air regular covid floor another 3 days. still go home oxygen couldn‚Äôt maintain 95 oxygen otherwise stable. took 3 weeks wean home oxygen. 

At 21 weeks went anatomy scan found baby severe growth restriction (iugr) absent end diastolic flow. measuring 16 + 2 21 weeks. told would likely stillbirth within week needed weekly checks heartbeat 3 week checks growth. following week still reverse end diastolic flow dr said normally marker imminent fetal demise. prepared took leave work, next week still there. hopeful may able carry she‚Äôs big enough medical intervention since 100 grams 450 needed feeding tubes/intubation equipment etc. 

At 24 weeks went checkup blood pressure 186/102 growth scan. told someone drive larger labor delivery hospital immediately. time instead taking antepartum monitoring taken labor delivery room told within 3 hours blood pressure doesn‚Äôt drop 155/109 24 urine came back significant protein would consider confirmation severe preeclampsia even without changes blood work recommend immediate induction, point measuring 226 grams earlier scan, much small equipment size help her. Luckily able get blood pressure threshold 10 grams amlodipine staying additional blood pressure monitoring 4 hour checks heartbeat. 

I stayed 3 days, last day afternoon check nurse trouble finding babies heartbeat, catching mine. called dr bring ultrasound machine. longest 5 minutes silence life nurse started sniffling. knew couldn‚Äôt find heartbeat. Dr confirmed couldn‚Äôt find heartbeat see movement. given choice medial &amp; E, induction chose induce could hold baby autopsy/placenta study performed. following afternoon induced delivered baby 9:59 following morning. Knowing delivery you‚Äôre stillbirth already hard, nothing really prepare silence. know won‚Äôt cry, somehow still expect it. 

I received autopsy back within week, nothing anatomically wrong baby. 2 weeks later placenta study came back, found CHI autoimmune response body basically attacked placenta filling junk little nutrients could get baby. also found villous syncitiotrophoblast necrosis recognized hallmark covid 19 placentitis. believe covid infection triggered immune response body attacked placenta. CHI occurs likely reoccur subsequent pregnancies. 

At point there‚Äôs obviously nothing do. I‚Äôm little 3 weeks post delivery still mentally struggling. can‚Äôt say whether bodies immune system would still responded way whether I‚Äôd gotten vaccine not, wish had. slight chance wouldn‚Äôt have, really wish had. No, I'm saying can't simply hole forever expect go away. privilege save us it. going continue spread remain threat globally long time. 

As much want treat ""those selfish people"" ""glorious imperfect me"" simple. vast bulk world simply cannot stay home pretend exist. vast bulk people can't little angels take ""THE CYBER"" avoid risks. 

The rest world shoulders burdens you, liege, stay safe. Good thing, too. you. you. bury kids

LOL, treat like fait accompli. SUPER low risk. means everything within means protect kids

Just pretend rest us making similar calculations, trying best either. That's thing. one thing protect kids something that's low risk say ""I'm super risk averse."" another call rest world can't bunch selfish pricks care kids.

You think wife love kids? What, think quit medicine even though way likely vector anyone lives? guess like doctors around!  yet pay gone staff sticks around. wonder people still pick travel contracts areas travelers burnt everyone else? Large vaccinated populations, middle summer, virus outbreak.. hmm. Oh guess unvaxxed yalls opinion see another shutdown quarantine future (united states) also told people shoot anyone tries encourage vaccines. domestic terrorist. emergency c-sections (several either mom and/or baby died) one pregnant mama vent don‚Äôt know she‚Äôll make it. unvaccinated

And believing they're protecting one notice care RIGHT worst Covid ever US?‚Äù

I think couple reasons, one cases concentrated certain states areas, terms cases especially deaths per day worst we've nationwide.

Another much believe threat covid matters, vast majority unvaccinated people die covid. caring ones shitty, deadly. Can't really hold liable give non-answer, point think Yeah, today Tuesday would getting Mondays numbers today.

If read tweet, Friday, Saturday, Sunday numbers.  dispise political parties, republicans eat big ol bag dicks. typical side effects associated vaccine? curious. Obviously COVID worse, (short-lived) side effects intense broad nature, might doctors hesitant recommend it. protected party.   wonder don‚Äôt know ask question without called piece shit. Imagine age 3-7 locked away society 2 years little human interaction outside parents (or siblings you‚Äôre lucky enough them). *huge* fucking portion life cause problems development. hope I‚Äôm wrong seems like nobody talking this. everyone misunderstands maybe need work communication skills. Gulf Stream collapses Hudson Bay freezes over.  Good guess? gym daily July 2020 May 2021, wearing mask every time. ran treadmill least one hour daily mask. stunk! always uncomfortable, never got used it. days I'd sweat much felt like waterboarded myself.

I've allowed since June gym maskless since fully vaccinated I've loved it. want go back. described nephew's situation perfectly. hope pray ok. parents trump, antivax, dip shits. Ellenton here.

I'm glad work determined keep us remote permanently. teams going back office, supposed early September already pushed back.

Luckily wife home bodies. we're like stay home, desperate travel again. trips remote areas country near many people hopefully helps alleviate cabin fever.

Just really wish people ridiculous vaxxing masking source info nugget? curious. best friend delivered beginning July. signed vaccine opened her, SE Missouri lot misinformation anticovid vaccine goes around. terrified get even though doctor recommended get said safe her. 

When went get it, NURSE stopped right gave shot said ""Are SURE want this...?"" felt horrible, ended going it, said left tears called comforted right thing.

I livid her. unprofessional. hope nurse one this, seeing nurse vaccination rate, I'm guessing not. Sorry, can‚Äôt c‚Äômon. won‚Äôt ever board ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù you‚Äôre obviously okay with, matter age. you, though. county passed mandate universal masking - three weeks- parents LOSING minds. apoplectic. Thank god kid isn‚Äôt school aged yet. feel parents deal crazies.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôm like really? three weeks? wait vaccines get passed younger kids take masks off?? vaccinated people need ventilators non-Covid reasons?

What shitshow. Well, mother American citizen born, makes American citizen even though born Canada. So, American birth eligible presidency, unless legal challenge results Supreme Court interpreting things differently.

This Obama Birther crap pushed Trump complete bullshit Cruz never hopped bandwagon. Yes rare complication. Probably par rate viral encephalitis acute necrotizing encephalopathy seen influenza. No, rate neurological complications seen Covid far exceeds seen common cold - rate respiratory complications, coagulopathy, multisystem organ failure significantly greater Covid vs common cold. compare virulence pathogenicity common cold Covid point pandemic foolish. Oh, texas. would thought? question: end goal? learned vaccines extremely effective preventing illness &amp; death still may carry viral load due Delta variant. solution get many people possible vaccinated masks restrictions end? another vaccine works developed strong enough vaccinated carry viral load heavily? solution masks forever?

I hard time seeing goal - even finish line - goal everyone working towards. anyone insight? noticed came lockdown ‚Äî 4 different viruses tear house back back (and took several COVID tests sure, negative).

So definitely something wasn‚Äôt even thinking of, it‚Äôs something needs major consideration. thinking long term negative psychological effects missing crucial social development time, generally state poor mental health critical developmental period. risks disease would honestly need *much* higher good trade children. people entitled? Sure impossible, life wear interesting piece, sudden forced upon them. That's quite change someone's life changes make people uncomfortable. ""Entitled"" thrown around word days... perfect world, everyone would shut complain single thing... would nice. mean know last one, there's least one go. think mostly everyone exposed vaccine infection hospitlization rate decrease even infections keep happening. might live flu season year round due covid. last line bit ironic given reads like anti-China propaganda. 

Yes, vaccines less effective. However also available cheaper West hoarded effective vaccines, point many doses wasted. Despite less effective Chinese vaccines nevertheless provide significant protection, look Chile. Yes, news like please.   I‚Äôve seen learning kids remote. another year would disastrous. see shitstorm coming...prepare umbrellas    She‚Äôs vaccine dodger, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs anything that‚Äôs going convince her. ""Children fine, pack 'em schools!"" Ignoring adults also inside schools get even they're vaccinated, happened friend mine, hospitalization rate kids increasing school fully started yet everywhere.  matter. unmitigated slaughter people continues temporarily wearing cloth coverings much horrific!!! /s ""Stupid people try something stupid try able continue stupid"" 


FTheadlineFY Haha we‚Äôre fucked haha vaccine 12 first‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm vaccinated everyone be. need acknowledge cases even 100% vaccinated rate. still keep posting stories daily positive counts. point move move brand.  I'm pretty okay unvaccinsted person gasping breath home. Fuck em. Stay strong üí™ ‚ù§Ô∏è reading story makes long better days ahead people relatively uninformed whatever reason? cannot deny way much inconsistent information surrounding many facets pandemic. insult/downvote someone trying learn more? Even they‚Äôre insincere, provide facts let be? totally selfish. could give rats ass anti vaccine morons.  90% sure would hospitalized vaccinated (I got rona) asthma. don‚Äôt/won‚Äôt care. wall ignorant dissonance secure. reassessment necessary. perfectly viable solution. *need* reassess hell population fucking uneducated. think that's right, UK, Pfizer vaccine first came initial caution regarding giving pregnant women (I seem recall checklist item vaccinators ask about, first month 'best not' - changed fairly swiftly, initial messaging made people cautious. agree, whole course PT wearing mask little uncomfortable totally doable. also done cardio indoors out. asthma. Exactly. can't control people do. Everybody get vaccinated, don't, did, I'm good. 

If everybody thought way, people would get vaccine. time start.  funny see people look numbers without ability really think big picture. 

New York others hit FIRST people generally idea happening bad happening. 

Delta hitting florida like original hit NY. difference know help stop spread, idiots charge wont it. work Trump one work DeSantis. 

A logic class might good folks can't see big deal. whole return in-person school without vaxxed mask mandates distancing maybe maybe needs get reassessed. imaging heart monitor beeping:

FAU-CI ... FU-CI ... FAU-CI ...  literally hard downvote. I‚Äôm pregnant everything fine, couldn‚Äôt imagine worry NICU nurses vaccinated not. selfish. One ICU nurse absolutely cover Covid patients normal ICU patients. They‚Äôve super sick need tons care plus add time putting on/off isolation gear. get ""Fuckin' duh!""? Yes, renewed statewide mandate plays Republican hands regardless candidates. NC's state Republican party would give FL run money able take trifecta control again. worth risk.  FrEedoM SPeeeCHh üòµ‚Äçüí´ Trump's task force stealing them.

Not time saying nurses must selling ""out back door"". article comment referring vaccine. Distancing masks obvious. Hurts bit worse see ~1/3 Americans interest getting vaccinated..but 1/4 Canadians seem give shit either guess really matter hahah.  types gastric symptoms, may ask? Honestly study makes *very* happy Canada allowed mixing.

Not get Moderna dose #2 sooner, also likely give lasting protection done double Pfizer. wonder getting vaccine help kid like tends help folks long haul leftover covid crud. can't believe sending kids school states like Florida infection rate 4 times higher remote learning. 

This got plan gov. get everyone sick, die, strong survive. way look he's doing... right? Dr. Evil take Gov.'s office FL last 12 months? Serious question, what‚Äôs stopping someone going clinic offering Moderna telling didn‚Äôt get Pfizer anything else yet using Moderna first shot booster? 
 
The clinic got Pfizer shots didn‚Äôt even check ID wife doesn‚Äôt social left field blank. AWOL 2,000 years long enough take schedule.   Just.... send back Canada, please? Hi. Currently pregnant vaccinated. 

If you‚Äôre US - load shit. one first groups allowed get vaccine due high risk status. Yep. Got Pfizer #1 Moderna #2 study making feel vindicated everyone saying ""but never ran clinical trials mixed dosing, risky"". bet lots staff quit many breaking point now. get paid enough deal idiots abuses.

Time bring freezer trucks. china covid? Anyone know conditions border irrelevant respiratory virus that's long introduced country though legal travel spreading within communities. COVID 93% mortality rate instead 3%? essential imagine worst case scenarios disaster recovery plan. COVID far worst thing could happen could something would require sort triage someday. would foolish completely unprepared without sort plan. think denying in-state help/prevention supposed first step getting out-of-state help. mistake, edited original comment really sucks. found working mask pretty miserable. enjoy going gym much don‚Äôt wear mask. guys post history shows he's commented virus ""overhyped."" thinks warrants extreme interventions field hospitals hospital ships, Trump save Houston. it? saying he's allowed change mind, he's year half late.

Of course deleted comment. Here's [some concerning CDC recommendation.  every weekend since opening, great time every night :) Money/'big corporate'  whole fucking county covid nobody dying it, fucking cares?

Because, discussed many threads subreddit, sick people still taking ICU beds hospital resources. cancer treatments surgeries delayed. get car wreck might literally able get treatment unvaxxed covidiots swamping hospitals. loved Fried ever since refused honor rush limbaugh lowering flag (one absurd ways pander seen awhile..and abhorrent) Use quotation marks stress healthcare workers, etc‚Ä¶just why. Maybe you. moderate asthma high rep squats days push sled we‚Äôre absolute hell mask. I‚Äôm glad gym longer requires them. God. desantis. trump. Well, that‚Äôs people smart enough realize problem dumb enough think three help. It‚Äôs shit show there. Here's hint: He's guy spent 3 days cave, everybody surprised came out. recently went cinema California ordered popcorn flavour shaker should‚Äôve seen look confusion asked ketchup ü§£.  deprived nation. /s I'm sorry bug can't figure own: earth 'kegeragor'?!

Did mean write 'keg rager'? mean write 'keg refrigerator'? *is* something I've never heard before? I'm curious. Thanks time. agree risk. conversation we're underscores people agree risk. want hand wave away conversation great certain risk changes behavior justified result risk. want shortcut ""if covid, risk inherently great.""  I'm entirely sure point trying make. Delta already Canada. Obviously going attempt border fraud. vast majority Americans coming going responsible citizens reasons listed earlier. guys got caught never made Canada. fully vaccinated. defending came following legal process (the people significant threat Canada's well being). Although agree heavier fines. understand new standard $750k fine 5 years jail time.

To reiterate, covid going away anytime soon. never right time near future. something need learn live with. entire argument basis can't keep famalies, loved ones, property owners apart forever. PCR test expensive act deterrent looking leasiurely travel. summer travel season well. Americans going entering country. Let seperated unite. strong measures place. Border security take fraud lightly trained spotting it. hint something border security tends turn away prospective travelers. Americans cause fourth wave Canada contribute significantly. educated decision government based data available. even make docket committee, empty gesture wants president 2025 thinks democrats able keep enough constituency alive make happen loving it. every weekend ball. How's bedroom still terrified leave smelling? What‚Äôs really sad comment could apply multiple states right now. Korea still allowing pregnant women vaccinated. Mask mandate vaccine mandate (early enough) could prevented mess. Poor child. hope gets it. Please [read CDC. remember OBGYN's office pregnant nurse hospital called ask pregnant patient ER able receive tetanus shot. OBGYN gave adamant NO. said vaccines (in general) given pregnant woman OBGYN definitely antivax. general guidance around vaccines pregnancy OBGYNs people receiving vaccines they're pregnant unless specific guidance so. Reason many studies safety unborn babies. 

Public health officials issued specific instructions pregnant women...not leave individual OBGYNs make arbitrary decision feel would *personally* responsible negative outcomes baby. mean, imagine OBGYN would feel told patients get vaccine public health never issued specific guidance something bad happened baby.

I'm Canada federal public health agency specifically issued guidance pregnant women April. manager pregnant time advised get vaccine public health issued specific instruction pregnant women. Yeah okay. Let get straight - Florida mandate masks, vaccines, social distancing; Florida demonize Fauci; Florida penalize schools teachers masking children ... way Florida wants Federal Government supply additional ventilators. - **get fucking shit together first** \- talking DeSantis. kidding. surprised staff open house(s). 2 children different schools. teachers 3 wore masks. alarming. wait teachers get covid quarantine, use personal sick time go around. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* supposed go second destination honeymoon, put hold far probably last minute Florida improves quickly (doubt tbh). 

From I‚Äôve heard, parks taking lot measures still wouldn‚Äôt risk personally. I‚Äôm double vaxxed Moderna young would like sick thousand miles home. Yup. pregnant, got doses, first 10 weeks, second 18. OB recommended told relieved work convince me. Aka: ""Fauci fuck Florida"" German politicians pretty much telling us expect masks stay *at least* five years, so... We‚Äôll noticeable child deaths school year. won‚Äôt matter, remember Sandy Hook? Murdering kindergartens zero impact psychopaths.  sucks. I'm sorry. shocks many people need vaccine unused supply become USA. Also, vaccines effective others world needs access those. honestly know solution long term, entire world needs get endemic forever. Yea, im vaxxed yet since age group eligible yet country. Double mask, alcohol disinfectant norm gym Vaccinated folks unlikely need hospitalization die, I‚Äôm sure enough data know risks long COVID breakthrough cases thought double vaxxed 40- something, main concern. bizarre level failure triggering riots Florida. think going save them?  Must nice privileged enough lock home without end date. Good thing entire country able thing, right? solution work vast, vast majority people especially considering virus endemic never going away. Paywall new site I'm unable find site. anyone else access information? fuck FDA waiting for. Covid fixing stupid. sick angry people stupid, feeling bad stupid. point bootstraps Republicans always talk appear? going blow terribly.  mean takes lot balls cities override states.

Which happening instances.

I think learned first outbreak, widespread federal rules real option Pfizer. Second shots back late March.

I deal worse symptoms sinus issues near weekly basis time year, caught me. vaccines supposed do. sure break cases far break cases typically requiring hospitalization. hospital overflow would unvaxxed. Says it‚Äôs migrant camps humanitarian settings Deflect, deflect deflect  Lol... orange imbecile would've done best rage tweeting, blame Obama, called flu go golfing every weekend.

Don't worry, it'll disappear April, like magic. doesn't, drink Clorox shine UV light ass. very, beautiful. Tremendously beautiful, beautiful since Abraham Lincoln! Oh wait, also happening Florida? Hmmm... pattern here? ü§î 44.6% fully vaccinated. worst definitely best. honestly expect pandemic ‚Äúover‚Äù 12-16 months? something productive every day, don‚Äôt fret ‚Äúthe next mask mandate‚Äù. You‚Äôre today. hope it‚Äôs good day you. love Canada, too, get fooled: share idiots. :(   don‚Äôt even use ventilators much first, shows dire situation currently. Texas cities famously known urban sprawl needing cars? pregnant friend misinformed. Please share [this CDC her. Surprise, surprise. wonder happening Texas... ü§îüòÜ good luck, Canada. inversion Republican talking point.

Republicans want make everything ""personal responsiblity"" right fuck up, problems national concern.

It's ""personal responsibility"" affects republicans personally.

And say stupid shit like ""millennials can't afford homes they're eating much avocado toast.""

Because conservatives fucking stupid, I'm tired pretending aren't. 

Conservatism refusing take responsibility society live in, one trouble, case society owes something.

They're literal parasites. that's Texas situation. parasite. made stupid decisions, they're begging rest us bail out.

And we'll that, want new Texas mutation virus.

But I'll point forever example conservatives, again, fucking stupid never get say words ""personal responsibility"" ever again. moving average moving wrong direction‚Ä¶and quickly. really indication covid transmissible fall winter? northern cities going surge surge now? Actually may message businesses mandate vaccinations. mean weeks ago. one really thinking this.

No need auto-cynic  Unless every parent sign too, requirement.  sound like anti-vaxxer whataboutism you, life death them. have‚Äîand Ronnie went school board members superintendents directly. Oh one, 70% GD population gets vaccinated, requires 70% population it. 50% vaccinated vote overwhelmingly one way, unvaccinated other. CDC going win FOX. Same! Katrina tore apart, anywhere near LA. still want know little boy, name Charles, want know he's doing. cool calm said ""we need help!"" Little guy shredded top seeing, well, aftermath all. 

For real though, scary shit! Anything carry water weight, I'm giving shit absolute right way I'm running Canada! 

You remember old days weather channel? good remember thinking see Cantore, time find new home üòÇ  God helps help Aha, fine. 96 today! Practically fall weather. That's million dollar question. like asking ""why people get cancer not."" comes individual immune system, guess... UK variant India variant called Delta variant? one governor best remove mask mandates that? fact managed locally kinda whole federal problem. really difficult wear mask gym. done entire time. cardio weightlifting. Even playing basketball. done PT well. even better, never got sick once. less concerned plane shitshow Florida right now. 

Due federal mask mandate‚Äîand fact flight attendants fuck shit don‚Äôt wear mask plane‚Äîtravel isn‚Äôt terrible right now. read study New York Times several months ago air changeover rate planes actually really good. appears dangerous part eating, particularly airport restaurants. 

But get Florida bets off. posted yesterday dad Florida needs heart surgery admitted early doctor didn‚Äôt know bed would still available day surgery. It‚Äôs bad there. 

Of course, come Coronavirus subreddit, hear people obsessed Coronavirus. figure people would worried things average person. take account.

But also take account would traveling US hot spot governor actively taking measures facilitate spread coronavirus. would go Florida right except emergency.  Yep, son perfect age us Europe (and really lasts years). Wanted 2020, nope. Wanted 2021, nope. point lot faith 2022 either. I'm guessing Texas Florida here. Florida looking Louisiana: ""Pathetic!""   Huh? Oh man time start another 20+ year war, it? Makes sense, thanks reply. Abbott clear must rely personal responsibility, government mandates

Doesn‚Äôt statement imply getting vaccine responsible choice, refusing one acting responsibly? know they‚Äôre talking right? Texas instruments? love seeing literal whataboutism wild aware this, Israel far away 100% vaccinated That‚Äôs still 44,000 deaths get almost perfect compliance. feel bad friends Florida. shitshow. Hi, pregnant person here. absolutely get vaccines pregnant. don‚Äôt know doctor would advise it. dozens us! right die want to...

Sure, guarantee careless driving kill innocents. also ensure definitely killed right away -- lingering crippling injuries responsible society pay for. Like study? like works pretty well! 

Phase 3 COVE Study: Updated cases show continued strong efficacy, including greater 90% cases COVID-19 greater 95% severe cases COVID-19, approximately 6 months median follow-up post dose 2 We‚Äôre still pandemic, don‚Äôt understand people suddenly whipping ‚Äúwell life risks‚Äù argument time. doesn‚Äôt apply here, there‚Äôs specific risk still exists virtually us agreed serious months ago.

Paying attention specific identifiable risk still prevalent trying mitigate doesn‚Äôt commit people needing start worrying incessantly risks life. sure you‚Äôre downvoted correct take. said, reason freely say isolated concert certain could get tested confirmed negative. say wasn‚Äôt taking precautions.  Sad takes stories change people‚Äôs minds. should‚Äôve never happened. Dude, guy grieving venting.  would rather kill someone weapon allow falsely imprison inside home. People died lockdowns due covid. idea batshit insane. wont. care American lives prior birth texas good vaccination rate? surprised - ive found continually shocked many labour rights seem gentlemans agreement rather actual right enshrined law. First off, wish family speedy recovery! &lt;3 said ""highly cautious people spent year half inside double masking."" May ask became less careful masks got vaccinated / caught Covid? I'm asking wondering one one still get Covid one keeps strict masking. Passing antibodies placenta effective via breastmilk encourage women get TDAP shots pregnant well flu shots Definitely try get kid who‚Äôs old enough though. See get without given symptoms.  Hopefully get fooled is. Added fact rhat js winter. I.e. hot people stay indoors. MYOB iowa. Noone cares. in-laws Huston got new variant, whatever happens happen quite hard deal long lasting emotional trauma. Get vaxed friends Yes People think logically care. 100% people vaccinated, 100% cases vaccinated people. take vaccination rates account. Every thing eat alive derived living organism, getting around that. We're plants can't convert dirt energy. 42% effectivity barely anything slow spread. much world needs shots, need show things down. area world many cases do. feel u/Neusbaum hope things spiral badly rest fellow Texans making decision based science medical experts vs. politics Facebook. 

And remember run hope things spiral badly rest fellow Texans making decisions based science medical experts vs. politics Facebook. keep Repubs power. That, true (and certainly believe it) makes doubly sad. It‚Äôs really tough swim mask on. Impossible, actually. around bunch covid deniers 3 weeks ago. spewing types crazy bs imagine.  3 separate times people mentioned one say care civid mitigation weren‚Äôt stopping migrants. people white virtually 100% white county significant covid numbers past wave. someone dreams getting vaccinated twice week, want cry imagining getting thrown trash =(   Ah, reason virus running rampant Florida tourists. Got it.

It anything governor's poor management situation. know, seemingly trying everything power eliminate steps taken help stop spread virus?

Seriously, honestly think whole situation Florida due tourists? That's hot take right there. Please elaborate Africa thing. Chile vaccinated mainly CoronaVac went medical advice ""beijing influence stronger here"", (as u/chriswmf pointed out), enough Pfizer Astrazeneca doses us. One right decisions government made buying vaccines whatever provider could find: every major vaccine variant one point used simultaneously vast majority doses administered coronaVac Well point get vaccinated staying home make sure goes smoothly.

But aren‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. Hahaha yes Canada combination thing already.  Averages that. One agency rounds 270, another 265, one 255, another 280, average together get: 267.5 (I swear, first try, damn got close). want doctors hospitals start turning people awayu depending steps took prevent needing go said hospital?

im right you, long include morbid obesity, alcoholism, cancers related tobacco, type 2 diabetics, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

(im actually right you, horrible idea). Instead certain party America wants open floodgates give up. worse? China probably less dead, tell me. I'm one them. every new donated batch get, people fight rich people usually get first. old. We're working giving first doses elderly capital city, give second dose end year, move cities.    Someone work tried bringing swine flu vaccine killed swine flu itself. googled it, even went duck duck go, find anywhere. asked show link saw, said feel need try convince knew truth booing me? I'm right ever time covid restrictions completely gone good? Masks back live, county ruled shutdowns. Even mask mandate lifted, I‚Äôm sure another one next variant. I‚Äôm depressed. feel like normal life never coming back. none top comments really anyone pushing 3rd shot boosters? Like seriously that‚Äôs best hope nobody talks high risk child fully vaccinated, thank goodness. merely-has-a-heart-murmur child young.

I hope school district take seriously, using CDC recommendations, honestly don‚Äôt know. homeschooled last year poor kids can‚Äôt again. It‚Äôs affecting mental health interact kids outside other.  seem like TX struggling FL hospitalization room? Despite like half amount cases per 100k?

Or seeing articles would socialism? Greg Abbott suddenly become communist? Let voters voted for. Abbott admitting defeat

He doesn't.   person asked, got first shot (Pfizer) week ago. reason waiting long already myocarditis couple years ago (from flu). nervous would higher risk another myocarditis, given fact Pfizer Moderna side effects. course, knew likelihood getting myocarditis 100 times higher Covid, get irrational fear week ago.

Now seeing thread, wish gotten Moderna, though. :( likely, 70% vaccination would prevent spread disease R0 6. reported article. 

The US good collecting population health data due privated nature healthcare, also HIPA laws. Countries like UK, Canada, Israel centralized healthcare systems records tend better collecting detailed data population health Trust me, stupid, probably tad smarter Floridians. must lying right? supposed say, numbers fake governor lying get extra money. That's right? old misleading. deals humanitarian measures extreme evacuation emergencies.

OP: post mislead people?

Actual Operational Considerations Implementing Shielding Approach Prevent COVID-19 Infections Humanitarian Settings

Now know rule 2 exists. trying misleading get banned tbh. Yes vaccinated folks areas extremely low transmission. Doesn‚Äôt matter. ‚ÄúLambda‚Äù prominent strain within months‚Ä¶ several studies Lambda show vaccination useless it.

Before mob starts shouting ‚Äúanti-vaxer!‚Äù, I‚Äôm vaccinated. Yup, would rather make less work butt hospital cares whos administrators dusting scrbs helping out. treat always pay. TX, OK KS didnt pay nurses enough precovid also could hurting more. short staffed walking aren‚Äôt mRNAs effective Delta? [According protection infection dropped steeply July much less previously. 

Of course, vaccines massively protective major indicators hospitalization death‚Äîthat changed. even 75% protection infection great. Nate Silver seems comparing J&amp;J Delta infection numbers mRNA wild type infection numbers. I‚Äôve got family member nurse that, pay insane she‚Äôs eating going comment this!! looked 75 mil give take May know vaccine husband had? think idea go jail breaking government mandated order aimed stopping slowing spread virus plaguing globe... anxiety definitely growing around this. vaccinated Pfizer December early January, conceived May seemed like turning corner COVID. know I‚Äôm still somewhat protected, seems like Pfizer‚Äôs efficacy really waves time (especially Delta). It‚Äôs frustrating delayed pregnancy try safe possible, time, situation still scary. Can't get sick alive!

 
\*taps forehead la 'modern problems require modern solutions' meme format\* Absolutely ask postpone. Wife Pregnancy take priority considerations including polite family. going filled anxiety either way. Either worry bringing virus making mad asking come. So, unfortunately anxious discomfort given. control contact vector. one situations, anyone cant accommodate rules get participate. (I soon six month old, there.)  Thought still sincerely ""this fine"" mindframe.

That's problem. base thinks mask mandates make Stalin, becoming harder harder pretend everything fine. Republican politician right must serious rock-and-a-hard-place situation right now.  saw volleyball player keep mask entire time gold medal match. impossible.   Brown announced 8-5 OHA adopted rules 8-9. Oregon ahead Washington. game wiggle room WA didnt.

All healthcare undergo weekly testing starting 9-30 unless vaccinated. $500/day fines noncompliance. Wow, that's stunningly optimistic take situation! surprised?

Is Florida starting look like India?

Governor Florida failed city. too. talked like new variant much worse. delta variant may contagious previous virus. 
So vaccination made catch covid mild case it? Yep. initially optimistic since vaccinated every single person came back positive. feels unreal. Yes... open flood gate, anyone high risk access vaccine. person's personal decision risk. think modest uptick. There's certainly good percentage using excuse find another one approved. Definitely bigger catalyst article employer mandate. expect absolute avalanche employers one get full approval.  Obviously Biden shouldn't, wouldn't, that, think ""sinking level"" Biden attach strings request, like allowing local governments school districts implement mask vaccine mandates deem necessary. Antibodies wane. bound happen antibodies lingered forever lymph nodes would bloat, we‚Äôd look like gold fish.

What memory cells primed beat hell anything like resembles COVID. likely cause curb stomping virus gains advantage body. B cells create antibodies large quantities destroy virus cells aid beating. Unfortunately, means you‚Äôre prone infected, ALWAYS unless plan boostering every 6 months so. Even you‚Äôll still chance catching COVID.

Many studies shown memory cell response robust, long term immunity question. know you‚Äôre well protected catch COVID, you‚Äôre also reducing transmission since viral shedding reduced duration illness. incredibly frustrating, there's lot antivax propaganda disguised fearmongering vaccines' effects fertility. must run different Facebook circles nearly never see trashy articles recommended shared me, apparently something circling back spike protein targeted vaccines one found placenta (it's not), shot would cause body attack protein placenta, causing miscarriage.

It's bunk, course. got first shot 3 weeks (recently pregnant, even know yet), second 10 weeks. We're still chugging along.

The sad thing heard story nurse, apparently many young nurses vaccine hesitant. fear infertile, especially already struggling start family, powerful tool used antivaxxers. Maybe ask Mexico help. live dude? dealing directly impact irresponsible political theater every day? not, bugging it? Sad part is, could‚Äôve won. vaccines vaccine rate make COVID history delta got heels dug in. 35% population decided fucking pieces shit listen conspiracy theorist yoga instructors YouTube instead licensed doctor trust life. 
 
We needed beat COVID, weapon so. 35% people decided side COVID. easy let someone else bury dead. realize works differently people crossing border right? administration mobilize vaccines area encourage people get it, 30% refusing, simply can‚Äôt get yet, good enough job. highly doubt they‚Äôll using assisted living facilities vaccine distribution centers, 5-12 need additional place, thus need double administering vaccine. Moderna hit like fucking truck, maybe lol get vaccinated now. local walmart going ask see birth certificate bring vaccine say 12. literally think updated language week ago, yes, recently. never data suggest vaccine unsafe, lack data due vaccine tested pregnant people. Keep mind cohort telling eat deli meat, take Tylenol, take bath 98¬∞, etc. official language essentially stating ‚Äútake risk‚Äù absolutely deterred huge number pregnant people. got thinking. request monoclonal antibody infusion doctor even though don‚Äôt COVID since immune system compromised. guess might come cost insurance companies. Inject antibodies wait someone infected. Cost treat hospitalized, you‚Äôre treating much smaller number. Everything‚Äôs bigger texas last part: think ideology inherently anti-social. Admitting individuals actions impact people strong society benefits everyone something must deny costs. ideal state nut job forest guns pick trucks somehow self-sufficient, rejects change interactions strangers doc said pregnant women trials mostly 2nd trimester got vaxxed babies born issues due vaccine (this April 2021), since 1st trimester self-quarantined home, working home, wanted wait 2nd trimester. scheduled first jab first week 2nd trimester second three weeks after. 100% since June 8, 13 y/o. 2 y/o signed soon approve age group. There‚Äôs evidence show vaccine anywhere near level risk getting real COVID. Get jabs, you‚Äôll feel whole lot better! 

Plus give bebby antibodies too!! feel like pregnant woman scared get vaccinated. getting wrong information. 

My doctor told get vaccinated breastfeeding enough research. I'm sure telling pregnant women too. 

But anyways. research saying would pass baby milk. that's good enough me.  Rebekah Jones lol Variants mutate globally countries low vaccination rates regardless here. Another aspect virus spread inter species; cats deer mutate animals spread back humans. 

We always risk variants mutating spreading. first school open state 800 kids day 3 shut down. seem operating incorrect assumption immunity flip like switch we'll go protected ""stacking bodies."" immunity works. suggest leave medical experts make decisions. trauma past year half seems catastrophizing. suggest logging off, perhaps talking someone better dealing anxieties. 14 days administration needs better getting people coming vaccinated.

so dumbasses like bleat giving immigrants free healthcare? ever get tired waiting Final Solution? tested positive? That‚Äôs terrible luck. Look many headlines stating little none hospital beds left many parts country. That‚Äôs world ‚Äúkeeping moving‚Äù you? feel great 42% protection Pfizer right now. one single link reference material, databases, research material, nothing. one single link whole article.

Not surprising tbh, Guardian. Rebekah Jones, refuse report numbers daily, requiring hospitals report health department CDC directly‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Wasn‚Äôt trump sent broken ventilators New York California?  Like I‚Äôm saying go full retribution maybe make scream ‚ÄúFAUCI!‚Äù Honestly I'm you. I'm vaccinated, wife isn't.. unfortunate part we're yet pregnant trying. Last time took us year trying, going see fertility doctors get pregnant. We've also experience miscarriage past, wife absolutely terrified anything might lessen destroy chances getting pregnant.

That aside, I'm increasingly wishing would go get vaccinated anyways, although see side things well. shitty situation. Definitely kid that‚Äôs already here. sucks lose mom age, littlies really suffer developmentally that. yourself, life isn‚Äôt worth risking catching virus. I! I‚Äôm honestly starting feel believe things like riding motorcycle work much dangerous life getting covid vaccinated. 

But feel day going day Well Florida Texas also Level 4 demonstrated capacity deliver *at least* 3.4M shots per day. Approval would next come children aged 5-11. That's bit 30 million people. every one wanted immediately, would take 9 days vaccinate 3.4M shots per day. Capacity significant concern. Truth, say ""ICU beds"" often physical beds qualified ICU RNs staff them. Texas Florida best places work RN begin with, staffing shortage pandemic surprise anyone!   99.8% survive /s  
Fuck people say that. many pregnant women newborns hospital right now. That's good point. Even Canada getting priority access, able supply significant quantities internationally. Plus even Canada gets exclusive access cover local population, even covered relatively quickly shift pure exports. TIL   protecting Covid? mean except widely available free vaccines public health guidance? one making Texas versus illegals instead USA vs Covid-19.  would‚Äôve thought he‚Äôd cousin could retrofit tinsmithery ventilator factory cool half bil. That's I'm really thinking catalyst. Restaurants governments mandating people avoid places skirt around them. Put barrier job cut livelihood they'll change tune. many businesses want deal massive outbreaks losing good employees want feel safer office. based it, see adults 60 need booster. can't tell exactly why, far people speculating, probably Delta peak beginning turn endemic virus. necessarily immunity here‚Äôs Mayo article covid children that‚Äôll hopefully put ease   Glad here, too. pregnant sister trying avoid scary situation. number family members taking seriously appalling. (She vaxxed though. OB 100% aboard.) That's nuts reccomending them,some regulators seem intervention could possibly rare harm let harm happen. know plenty pregnant women died Covid, probably others miscarried. Meanwhile deaths miscarriages due Pfizer women age. no-brainer. access state. considered healthcare providers afterall. there's one thing thread comments show privileged are.

The fact first generation mRNA vaccines two companies highly effective, safe offer protection hospitalisation severe illness high 80-90% numbers absolutely brilliant amazing.

There people dozens countries vaccines available small numbers waiting handouts guys bitching Pfizer J&amp;J asking get Moderna shot privileged ass two doses Pfizer 7% shorter hospitalisation Moderna.

Check privilege. happy live country able get fully vaccinated fast ""free"".

Now, comes papers, authors clearly acknowledged variables caveats. 

The erratic drop happened Moderna June too, Pfizer ""better"".

This paper potential helpful formulating next generations mRNA vaccines dose effectively.

That's really it.

Doesn't matter Pfizer Moderna. right thing protecting people around you.

Stop acting like children. recently?

There never data suggest anything perfectly safe woman pregnant take vaccine.

Sorry I‚Äôm bit heated - know multiple people bought hesitancy argument ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm pregnant.‚Äù I‚Äôm empathetic course, evidence information available months. least [since first heard someone went ahead looked up.

When talk anti-vaxxers, need concerned with. people think Bill Gates microchipping us satan whatever. It‚Äôs people hold inaccurate beliefs vaccine refuse adjust presented new data. positive test mild symptoms basically ideal scenario children right now. like they've received single dose Pfizer/Moderna. exactly! expectation maintain level health, already means troops inoculated something like 17 diseases iirc. completely reasonable required get covid vaccine near future know far even positive test still able immediately get skin-skin time. She‚Äôll hospital issued n95 time check-in, wear child, get hold him. We‚Äôre still trouble finding place this, course depends test. It‚Äôs presumed point I‚Äôll restrictions test positive, allowed present allowed full contact. hospital updating guidelines daily rn. fortunate delivery hospital deals women &amp; babies, pregnancy. general Covid patients. 

We actually discussed getting tested since negative test file, feels horribly irresponsible. You‚Äôre basing opinion what? vaccinated? parents vaccinated? get tested traveling go anywhere except airport travel? certainly precautions take, hanging anywhere without mask groups people. Stop. completely normal pregnant person cautious vaccines. even allowed take cranberry supplements got like 3 UTIs pregnancy. would get vax doc recommended knows doctors say. Drugs usually tested pregnant people! think got regular vax right giving birth normal vax even something new. think got flu shot pregnancy. saying coming unvaccinated areas months.

Here SW Missouri finally looks like peaked. hope kids starting school next basically, someone traveled 20 years past, would keep getting sick colds.

That fun episode 'Quantum Leap', lol Well, pushed ""extremely rare"" talking point, anyone looking data knew rubbish.

It's also psychology. People want done, understandably sick shit. kept saying ""the pandemic me."" always ludicrous. Even 40 risk super low, that's things work. can't unaffected pandemic killing hundreds day infecting many around dint sheer will.

So, people dismissed data like. Right, least grades 7-12, vaxxed masked. isn‚Äôt enough, we‚Äôre looking something truly catastrophic schools never possible. far K-6, need vax, masked, continue enchants safety features last year. 

Sadly won‚Äôt able close K-6 parents largely work. finding day care dangerous school. Hm, study also shows Pfizer 88% effective (against symptomatic infection) Delta (in UK), OP's study showed 42% (in US)... expect variation, that's also linked elsewhere thread, showing efficacy hospitalisations Delta 96% Pfizer 92% AZ (in UK). U.S. 61.1% fully vaccinated, 71.1% least one dose. daily counts administration ticked up, gap going people within 28 day wait, account big difference. lot people gone back second dose. age 65+ numbers 90.4% one dose more, 80.4% full. pending second shots, lot, vulnerable group also skipping second shots higher ideal rate.  Texas Gov: Federal government, GTFO tell do!

(Keep mind Total revenue fed. gov. $269.0 billion 2019 - 2nd compared states) doc said pregnant women trials mostly 2nd trimester got vaxxed babies born issues due vaccine (this April 2021), since 1st trimester self-quarantined home, working home, wanted wait 2nd trimester. scheduled first jab first week 2nd trimester second three weeks after. 100% since June 8, 13 y/o. 2 y/o signed soon approve age group.

Next time post, try think clearly trying say. paragraph goddamn mess. don‚Äôt trust they‚Äôre accurately reporting, period. DeSantis lording data since beginning pandemic. Yes!! got vaxxed soon could. Baby Bean won‚Äôt likely able get vaccine cold sore kill newborn, I‚Äôm taking chances! Parents CA vaccinated, they're largely protected. I'll still take barrage tests arrival sure too.

Ditto concerned kids - young nephews I'll visiting too, something keep mind. would say victims. may way independently check told situation going grain result loss gain. feel people.

Never got kids vaccinated flu, never took oldest child autoimmune disorder diagnosed. Blamed medical issues wifi, Obama, decided naturopath could cure them. Except oldest got MRSA developed cellulitis. youngest one hole heart turned blue oxygen deficiency. 

I feel people like that. feel victims go refuse admit might right told are. Europe, UK. Good! need scare people high numbers. girlfriend's best friend 8 months pregnant doctor advised get vaccinated. I'm assuming single case. Cousins doctor told get vaccinated could make able kid. doctor's spreading misinformation patients wonder country shit show. said  Abbott Variant spike protein different though, effectively different strain.

BioNTech Moderna generalized spike protein J&amp;J/AZ let full spike protein. Join fucking crowd! Says Oregon. response be, ""I want hear blip covid.""  Texas state board nursing doesn‚Äôt make easier state staff get in, tried go Texas 4 week travel nursing contract. Can‚Äôt go need Texas nursing license takes 3 weeks get one‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs emergency order let staff state in. Oh that's awesome, languages speak?

Yes, November-January seems. since vaccinated people spread (asymptomatic barely symptomatic) covid, right best interest stay home regularly contact people can't get vaccinated vaccinated months ago (elderly) might concerned about.

Rep party losing re-election also avoidable. Even JVCI says Prime Minister free wishes decisions followed voluntarily. JVCI already back tracked saying vaccinate healthy 18 &amp; 17 year olds unless high risk lived was. preparations way goes ahead, final decision made

While technically true, clear roll boosters. people charge already discussing prioritisation first line. JCVI go motions announcing plan. Politically clear, roll boosters British population riot forced lock again. lockdown occurs &amp; prime minister diverted UK vaccine supply sacked.

Unfortunately district, they're requiring doctor's note medical reason keep child home. oldest medical reason problem us feel parents want keep kids safe, regardless increased risk not. parents upset state's mask mandate well honestly, can't trust anyone right thing anymore.

Case counts taking faster Moderna stock! think counts late term abortion folks keep going about. unfair people, entire situation unfair. States like TX, FL, many southern states given trying slow spread voluntarily turned potential variant factories. People states travel parts country spread disease. That's fair rest us.

If want state right make response COVID respond poorly suffer. want states band together defeat COVID implement nation-wide mask vaccine mandates, done it. States can't expect freedom put individual state economy ahead nation-wide public health, expect rest nation bail uncontrolled COVID spread. raw number people vaccinated, are, mingle with, mingle, live with, etc. uniform dispersion 70% vaccinated going way different 90% vaccinated half state 40% another part state.

There also dumb luck, previous infections, many people fully vaccinated, etc. Really curious percentage people ICU beds  Obama change Sandy Hook exactly? 
The duopoly fucking problem. they'll screech FaTPhObiA You‚Äôre getting raped god‚Äîthat‚Äôs call it. ideology, economy. Even Texans know another wave trash economy again.  cannot take information politics isolated cases. literally tons research proves vaccines infinitely effective masks. Ahhhh,what breakthroughs? worst one America fucking broken. Jfc People look data say waiting data not. trying shame people ignorant busy. Latest number around 80 confirmed Delta cases, reality gotta much more... However time low active cases daily cases. longer quarantines there's little restrictions regards public activities.

¬øWhat could go wrong? /S  Pay wall things benefit health ""selfish"". wife works NICU. Previously pretty rare covid positive mothers passed L&amp;D, 1 2 time. past weekend 8 hospital. Last week lost mother ICU.  I‚Äôm grateful vaccine too. situation left perpetual mental state ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù caught covid vaxxed‚Ä¶how much worse would been‚Ä¶.kinda unnerving. Oh damn. Good   thought sub filled people knew severity virus wanted take seriously. 

Instead it‚Äôs people badly want certain narrative true try speaking existence false hope Okay Looks like application full approval ages 16+. approval expected sometime 1-4 weeks. Ages 12-15 currently EUA well. Ages 5-11 follow September, probably EUA - 5 clinical trials, sure timing there.

Edit: approval may open ""off label"" use younger ages. I'd like see wording approval labelling saying definitively. good time home birth. Even water home birth. try (in small way) estimate might go. 

Original Covid (OC) largely replaced Delta Variant (DV) US. Though imperfect, immunity past infection and/or vaccination render fair section population less vulnerable serious illness death. 

DV transmissible, maybe maybe serious - seems likely burn hotter, faster - mostly hosted prior exposure vaccination. 

If see lambda emerge, surely will, would expect sharp brief spike. Ultimately, herd immunity emerge, vulnerable either die get vaccinated. hardy survive. 

The problem many people assume they're far healthy really are. I've someone four different maintenance medications, history heart disease, diabetes, overweight say trust god-given immune system. Well alrighty then. state sub‚Ä¶ Guy advocate increase deaths months. 

Now deaths increased, wants help. 

Take L; resign governor title; let competent thinking adults start fixing mess. people keep harping research? supporters dead soon enough poor attitude killing racists think blame everything immigrants. Shame you. assume natural infection provides lasting protection getting reinfected. ""Governor Abbott clear must rely personal responsibility, government mandates,‚Äù Abbott press secretary Renae Eze said statement Monday. ‚ÄúEvery Texan right choose children whether wear masks, open businesses, get vaccinated.‚Äù

I also choose stop wearing seat belt, stop registering vehicle, stop driving right side road. I'm Texan, know do.. 
I mean, personal responsibility trumps gubment mandates, right? guess...

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* oops It‚Äôs crazy best hospital(or largest anyway) located texas. Pretty nuts collapsing. Idiot. narrative people sub convinced of. keyword-driven script? Okay, get. good potentially sacrificing health children regardless consequences. Thanks letting us know... Except unvaccinated people likely get infected, therefore likely spreading unvaccinated people (who may transmit much infected, get infected less).   know kids usually OK get virus I'd feel lot better ""letting rip"" Trump would say could get vaccinated well. Paediatric hospitalization non-COVID respiratory diseases jumping roof ([e.g. [another really seems like ""missing"" year normal respiratory diseases (kids sick time!) altered trajectory children's immune systems, also skewed normal seasonality viruses. 

I know long-term consequences kids getting sick 2+ years would be. Childhood critical period immune development learning difference ""pathogens"" ""safe"" things (self-antigens, food). coincidence kids always snot running nose. 

The fact normal respiratory diseases hitting hard probably reason delta hitting harder past variants. immune systems shape. Kids need running around playing kids, I'm genuinely worried long-term immune consequences quasi-sterile environment they've many months. Cuomo resigned  scared covid too. denier anything like that. wants another child bad wants avoid anything might hinder chances.

When went get vaccinated, want us try ~72 hours got worried might impact sperm cause complications, etc.

Much nonsensical illogical, realize extent, also wanting try everything possible increase chances getting pregnant suffering another miscarriage.

Other side diagnosed cancer months birth first. underwent chemo come alright all. chemo risk damaging eggs and/or leaving unable bear children. course necessarily know stand we're month #7 trying since given clear.

It's shitshow I'm best support know struggles lot stuff right now. ok minds thing random conference, law's eyes religion special status. pregnant women comment section, wife 8 months pregnant local pharmacy vaccine availability, J&amp;J, little convincing went got vaccine, 3 days later government cut due blood clotting issue, concern wife‚Äôs part regret mine, I‚Äôm happy tell I‚Äôm father happy healthy baby girl light lives. know scary get deadly illness pregnant poses risk baby well risk leaving Significant alone shattered. said would fully endorse getting vaccine it‚Äôs available. Hi Canada, neighbor, United States. Numbers incorrect: Wow Ok bud, say whatever need make feel good First, covid absolutely worse flu. either medically illiterate living rock know that. Second, want child safe. fucking comforting lot children survive dying. Polio ""only"" crippled like 30,000 children year people still vaccinated that. 3-week-old local ICU ventilator. There's 3-month-old ventilator local ICU. Awesome, Aubrey giant piece wanna alpha poser shit. Fuck dude. point valid Remove elected official endangering public serving people point. parts would concerning are:

* 31 weeks far delivery. get covid can't wife delivers? course concern wife get covid.
* going large concert shortly trip. She'll exposed hundreds people.
* refuses wear mask. Again, regularly exposed people...
* She'll flying visit you. Sounds like flying reasonably safe, especially vaccinated masked. trust wear mask properly plane?
* think know yet flying still reasonably safe delta ramping up.

Ultimately, delta really changed things. know vaccinated people getting spreading covid. would really crappy time wife get covid. comes comfortable with, personally (as fellow pregnant person) would comfortable it.  baby May. told vaccine safe good enough me. able isolate throughout pregnancy everywhere still requiring masks. covid getting pregnant time, reinvention reported common.. got vaccinated shortly baby born breastfed. blame pregnant women comfortable vaccine unless think microchiped something stupid like that. blame Biden. Hillary. Obama. think would liable providing advice contradicting CDC ACOG point trained bark like Pavlov's dog blame anything happens Texas immigrants even clearly issue bet 

You **KNOW** are! keep saying 70% migrants taking vaccine, 45% Texans done same. None colleagues department SC wearing masks, half aren‚Äôt vaccinated either. Fuck ima quit Maybe can't see :) think everyone get vaccinated! I'm observing even don't, death rate high liberals sometimes make be. completely sure anyone care even then. I'm gonna show walk hope let it.

If not, I'm close enough MN border could drive west try there.  lack empathy understanding pregnant woman reluctant get vaccine astounding comments. expect anything less ""cheer deaths people get vaccine"" reddit crowd. Yep. showed signs day drinking well water small town. incredible quickly went downhill that. identified large amount genes high penetrance associated disease - unfortunately think going something able treat future gene therapies like CRISPR. consider lot kids still unvaccinated - population children 12 US? - would nice parents could give kids nasal spray block getting infection first place..I'm sure there's parents would interested? wonder Sanotize israel? See

Mar 2021 Nitric Oxide - Canadian company - efficacious according company, still needs independent Well, may lacking immunity front, we're country full jelly doughnuts. count something, right? Fucking prick. It‚Äôs mess. Step down. Houston too, believe, thankfully. Kinda wish feds would refuse unless DeSantis recanted anti-mask nonsense. Please turn political question/discussion. 

I understand high cases FL vs example VA (732 vs. 98 per 100k rn) vaccination rates comparable (69 % vs 73 % least 1 dose 12+). live northern VA (liberal) way half people wear masks anymore / mask mandates. 

Is started spreading yet ? Kind like NY start pandemic missing something? Sorry, that's bit callous thing say.

As someone went grueling IVF journey, last sentence actually depressing. women can't make another baby...

Though even reason get vaccinated. I've seeing exact meme make rounds fb previous coworkers rehab used work at. Glad left man setting bad example clients. No, really need read infantile trolling. really better hope TX power grid fail now, tents get dangerously HOT fast! Im hoping will! Good luck new baby, first January even covid it‚Äôs joy Desantis said wasn‚Äôt big deal. need vents? lie?! /s Governor Death Sentence like Mayor Jaws. Gee wonder anything happening could change that? dying bad outcome. Absolutely. Washing hands helps allow sterile conditions. Surgery already taxing body. recovery, weakened state. last thing need surgeon washed hands touched god-knows-what digging around body. Infections post-op kill even healthiest people. Especially infections becoming resistant antibiotics. Back germ theory widely accepted, surgeons sanitized hands tools laughing stock field. higher survival rate surgeons worked non-sanitized hands tools. Yes, remember reading something newborn COVID. really got too. 4 year old well. think need kiddos, well me. provided, condition unvaccinated receive lower priority care. fair waste care resources, incentive get vaccinated. 2 ICU. 1 diabetes can't see. Permanent eye damage. 3 work currently 2 weeks+, hospitalized severely sick home. others moderately sick without severe symptoms.

Personally, that's gamble I'm unwilling take right now. Delta whole level.  seems unfair folks done best stay afloat amidst chaos. plenty Texans worn masks throughout pandemic followed regulations. They're constantly punished poor leadership, pandemic best time leave. They're drowning without lifeboat, people states want help. haven‚Äôt heard I‚Äôm pregnancy #3. know TDAP flu vaccines least explicitly recommended pregnant women third trimester baby get antibodies via placenta won‚Äôt able vaccinated time birth. Even got TDAP booster last year got pregnant, it‚Äôs totally safe get another one year 10 years up. 

I think guidelines vaccinations pregnancy, it‚Äôs wait 2nd trimester least fever common vaccine side effect, fevers first trimester harmful fetus, that‚Äôs I‚Äôve heard. I‚Äôm doctor, obviously don‚Äôt take comment gospel, overall, vaccines seem pretty safe pregnant people. Remember people want government keep hands Medicare. un-ironically hate idea socialized medicine simultaneously benefiting it. stop listening anti vaccine propaganda social media. That's one common themes works, fertility emotional issue. Thousands women become pregnant receiving vaccine. biologic plausibility could affect fertility. birth control easy. Probably think Moderna 15 doses vial Pfizer like 5? make sense open Moderna unless 15 people scheduled. poopy - prophetic? Yes. Spot on. ‚ÄúTake mask off. You‚Äôve earned right.‚Äù

- Joe Biden, last month 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time roll sleeves get back classrooms.‚Äù

- Joe Biden speaking NEA (National Educators Association) representatives yearly conference last month 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going lock economy schools. going back. turning back clock.‚Äù

- Jen Psaki, Press Secretary, Friday 

Yup! That‚Äôll fix it! time hospitals limit number unvaccinated COVID patients 65%-75% capacity reserve rest space non-covid related cases. choose get vaccinated need consequences accompany choice access hospitals ICUs needs one them. 

Passed vaccine? Got COVID anyway? Hospital already 75% full anti-vaxxers? Sorry luck. Here's tank O2 -- Go home good luck.

(obviously, apply children people medical condition prevent vaccinated)  entire American health system described one sentence. dont pass judgement state ypu dobt live in

Wait, what? can't form opinion based upon immense amount data easily available news reporting physically live Florida?

Come man. even ridiculous statement assertion virus problem Florida solely based tourists. Similar messaging OB, Reproductive Endocrinologist adamant get it, even IVF. glad did, agree messaging clear lot women caused hesitancy. fair, variants Alpha Delta arrived international flights. Since variants causing us may issues, flight restrictions first enacted IMO need system checking. go proving vaccine status. needs something centralized state using app, yet another app. right much way offering proof. Unless going accept photo CDC card call day. dont disagree vaccine requirments school jobs, easy prove HR administration office done, like SUNY Buffalo asking people bring vax card every Chem lab.
However one time places question proving it. Serious question. many doctors nurses terrible shape. know obesity problem states. people supposed know better. make 8-12 years school. can‚Äôt put chipotle. Pretty sure Northeast thing. We‚Äôre gunshy antivaxxers coming proclaiming vaccinated people getting hospitalized. Without context, initial comment sounds like might drinking flavor Koolaid. Anecdotally me. Fully vaxxed Pfizer January, covid positive bed day 4. fever feels like bad sinus infection. thirties comorbidities. can‚Äôt really feel bad parents CHOSE get pregnant pandemic getting vaccinated. Newborns conceived still mask mandates throughout entire country. awful people would think right time get pregnant? [And American College Obstetrics 

It updated end July Similar experience Moderna autoimmune disease complications, often react shots. felt awful week.  Republicans make sense things would quite different. would seem pre-existing conditions would reason get vaccine, since getting covid could worse complications him. Doesn‚Äôt take 5 weeks full protection kick Pfizer Moderna? We've denying transfers Texas ICU full (Kansas). mess there! what‚Äôs evidence then? start stacking bodies front nursing homes? good enough? time say, ‚ÄúWelp, looks like immunity gone‚Äù, it‚Äôs going late shit load people would anyone come help Abbott preventing precautions reduce spread? I.e. banning mask mandates. next, going ban use sand bags hurricane beg states disaster relief? Good job adults, getting kids vaccinated going critical. vaccine 42% effective, means 21% population blocking spread virus.

50% population blocking spread virus 42%, different 21% population blocking spread virus. There's also fact lots people already infected blocking spread virus % well.

It still important send use vaccines countries give healthy people boosters now. Significantly people saved way, chance preventing new variant virtually unchanged. Yes- totally feel this. knew we‚Äôd trying soon rushed get vaccine back telling women wait 6 weeks becoming pregnant. got pregnant sooner honestly felt like something bad long time one info yet. I‚Äôm glad made point get shot early, I‚Äôm hoping boosters approved end pregnancy give son little boost too. wish would happen. would also halt insane amount international flights much world hasn‚Äôt chance get vaccinated fault own. would cause huge disruptions industry, also international economy whole. Perhaps next best thing would negative tests prior travel? know countries implemented that. Totally agree. real eye opening pandemic.

""limited government"" issue executive orders ban masks schools cruise. 

Claim ""pro-life"" ban preventive measure spread contagious disease anti-vaccine. 

I feel sorry rational people caught politics. Politicians sacraficing people lives pander voters. Double vaccinated ‚â† unvaccinated. 8 week gap means there's lot people allowed second dose yet. OK, offer help. few. Paid upfront.

Still remembering want help Super Storm Sandy hit. literally &lt;German bad personally using masks getting vaccine, disagreeing idea mandates?  Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-29 vaccine currently authorized ages 12 older, whereas Moderna Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines authorized adults 18 older.

COVID-29?? Damn, we're planning way ahead. Bad bot get already, I'll even help take care troops trip fall something. ( healthcare worker) knew... poor kids starting school right screwed. 12 can't get vaccine. stuck crazy parents believe science. people immediately eligible going who‚Äôs received doses beginning (the elderly). highly doubt it‚Äôs wise allow children assisted living facilities get doses time elderly, need double distribution centers. Things seem fairly consistent pointing toward Moderna vaccine (as currently administered) better Delta. point, seems likely true.

But yeah, especially comes actual numbers, feels like things change week week. discrepancies reporting country country don‚Äôt help.  original comment removed way added second source. midst politically charged tantrum seems passed comments nothing race immigration, point administration simply failing provide needed amenities people border terms pushing vaccination. Also, source quite literally says ‚Äúfederal authorities made data available cases.‚Äù regard aid provided crossing border, assume it‚Äôs happening clearly viable unless better source. ‚ÄúThe main culprits people refuse get vaccinated.‚Äù whole point here. 30% migrants refusing vaccines, administration needs better getting people coming vaccinated. much seem think did, mean migrants people covid, moreso need better field. Someone went high school baby; nurse working home? That's got Instagram. Anyway, literally got vaccinated hospital giving birth. posted super cute picture husband holding baby showing CDC vaccine card hospital. 

I think people pregnant victims anti-vaxxers, like people allergies immunocompromised. pregnant right really puts lose-lose situation; genuinely feel them. happened unreasonable. Feds basically stole emergency supplies.

It's right even talk again. time, states need cheered north west getting beat Trump's task force stealing them. needs form apology happened Trump. rich. Let rot. waste time know probably laugh this, can't help it. That‚Ä¶ seems less logical. you‚Äôre worried, maybe wait month two getting vaccinated? I'll look it, thanks! Yeah, it‚Äôs voters they‚Äôre killing‚Ä¶totally big brain time‚Ä¶ completely agree seems, make logical sense republicans can't win popular vote decrease number people voted republican. would make sense hype progressive bio attack meant kill economy socialism step save day every god fearing red white blue star-spangled republican get vaccine thwart plan. 30s misconception humans logical intelligent creatures evaporated consign fact got lucky family people either mentally deficient willfully ignorant.  sure either. genuinely trying get sense whether it‚Äôll worse year. commented elsewhere thread could‚Äôve worded comments better, got downvoted lot. assume people going profile mass voting. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è DeSantis tried negligence homicide point. heard?

Enjoy! It‚Äôs actually infuriating seeing doom peddlers continually ask vaccinated people cover faces. mean except fact Delta considerably more¬†transmissible¬†([2+ times much wild-type SARS CoV-2] considerably virulent ([nearly 5 times many contract require oxygen, ICU admission die] It‚Äôs coordinated disinformation campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

the midterm elections bloodbath democrats ""Hello step Fauci"" didn‚Äôt address fact there‚Äôs much higher number vaccine eligible 0-12 year olds, 12-16 year olds, combined 18+ due booster. Profit made treatment, prevention. Key Sophia one roughly 130 children COVID-19 admitted U.S. hospital day, according Centers Disease Control Prevention. number climbing since early July. July 31 Aug. 6, 216 children COVID hospitalized every day, average, nearly matching 217 daily admissions pandemic‚Äôs peak early January. though? *really* shocking? 


I think so. Depressing, infuriating, maybe, shocking? NOOOOOOOOooooope. sure want pregnant women vaccinated something whose clinical trials last 6 months tested pregnant women. could cause serious damage unborn child.

Doctors live advised this. Preemptively surrender! problem Delta significantly contagious impacting kids harder. kids get sick year seriously ill. I‚Äôm 33 weeks pregnant 2nd. work major hospital respiratory therapist. got vaccines back January I‚Äôve attempting get 3rd booster since June. cannot understand putting unborn child risk knowing statistics covid pregnant women. drives crazy. Vermont seems sick somewhere vaccination rate high af Yet pregnant friend saying ‚Äú3 different doctors told get vaccinated birth,‚Äù idk hard time believing given what‚Äôs going Florida Delta variant. Lol oh know!

I want know person thinks happened since keep saying nothing much happened last year I‚Äôm litigating, yeah  I‚Äôve posted elsewhere thought I‚Äôd try get information. 

My wife vaccinated (Pfizer March soon Florida opened doctors note) got breakthrough infection July 23rd. Nothing serious everything cleared within week except cough still going. unvaccinated 6 4 year old kids also tested positive mild headache one day 4 year old, symptoms.

I know likely immunity due positive test I‚Äôm curious almost entirely asymptomatic case different provided less immune response. likely reinfection them? safer positive test wear masks public stay away people? wearing masks school? 

Sincerely, scared dad. yeah, probably one hardest countries immigrate easy process Except delta wasn‚Äôt around last year.   Wow. You‚Äôre troll, hunh?

‚ÄúAnswers tiny amount information relevance matter hand.‚Äù sort reaction? thinking got placebo?

I'm imagining third dose (in case) would probably make feel like #2. But, guessing. Things going get control next year. new voting restrictions ballot box, they're controlling deems votes acceptable, bring new round shit, mutating pandemic top.

I'm afraid go outside nowadays I'm afraid seeing hog wild. full crusade mode ready die. wish joking. relief. I‚Äôm newly pregnant vaccinated back winter I‚Äôve anxious go get breakthrough delta case I‚Äôm likely breakthrough case. Early pregnancy really rough last time sick really scary. hear you. Running mask makes feel like I'm waterboarded. I'll jog outside now. local TV network currently ""Covid Pregnancy: Vaccinate Not"" Facebook page. like chum water anti-vaxxer conspiracy nuts. grossly irresponsible make look like there's kind debate. There's even requisite ""consult doctor"" disclaimer.  Except Delta infectious kids kids vaccinated don‚Äôt know mean ‚Äúzero reason‚Äù right kids infected hospitalized ever before.   Must nice agree. Let's use guts determine what's right wrong. enough effort bigot could dig kind hate facts support twisted claims. vulnerable among us might lap up, spurred dig (into nasty soil). really, cursory glance needed dismiss hateful focus ""facts"". forced interpret said, deleted original comment. 

And, still *didn‚Äôt actually answer question*.  OBs following ACOG CDC guidelines. got mine 20 weeks full support practice baby antibodies. No, haven‚Äôt. 

Have ever fit tested N95 respirator? annually - it‚Äôs annoying. 

The point failure mask, it‚Äôs seal. 

Unless mask forms tight seal face, getting much protection virus demonstrates least airborne transmission. 

There tricks getting tighter seal normal masks, doubling actually increases chances getting good seal, it‚Äôs you‚Äôre doubling filter. actually get good seal normal mask, protect well, guarantee getting good seal. 

You try fit test mister high concentration sucralose solution - taste sweetness, mask protecting airborne pathogens. 

Or walk past someone smoking smell it. 

Or maybe analogy appropriate reddit - doubling condom doesn‚Äôt help you‚Äôve poked hole them. google person's name, find CV/practice/resume decide reliable going reach herd immunity one way another. Would nice hit everyone getting vaccine, guess going option B people. point several years road, predict we‚Äôll see man-made mass extinction deer encouraging people walking concrete paths instead wooden trails. Viral encephalitis COVID changes imaging (MRI) would see psychological disorders. I‚Äôm certain ER doc/radiologist/neurologist taking care patient make correct diagnosis.   Apparently know B cells are. Tell one good thing ever come Florida? certainly possible, even delta, death rate COVID high.

How high *that* high*?*

Say death rate 1%, say probability mom dying independent probability dad dying. 1 / 10,000 families parents die. Texas 10,000,000 households. Say half have, average, 2 kids. say half vaccinated.

5,000,000 / 10,000,000 \* 2 = 500 orphaned kids. 

That's *that* high? Step-Fauci, doing? 1) implying research teams work free?

2) one legit. goes ways. something happened covid positive 99% (the beloved number here) likely causation. something happened vaccination likely correlation we'll leave that. rare cases actually undoubtedly proved result vaccination standard response: odds still better.

Not got short end stick oh well, better luck next jab.  Totally agree teacher evaluations students. parents also helpful, know mean. Teachers jobs drastically challenging past year half sure, mention much students negatively impacted too.  
  
Regarding Catholic community, assume talking priests abusing others. You‚Äôre correct they‚Äôve given whole church bad name. It‚Äôs embarrassing needs addressed fullest extent.

GTFOH Remember /r/Coronavirus praised DeSantis Florida standing ""fear mongering"".

Pepperidge Farm Remembers... several weeks ago.   Exactly. Efficacy king, recent reports Moderna longer lasting protection true, Pfizer would wise advocate targeted booster could prove best weapon delta. also refuse issue state emergency unable bring medical staff around country. health department forced modify licensing laws allow practice time application, still pay license compared could simply practice valid license. Shots FUCKED. can‚Äôt wait try vote out. He‚Äôs idiot he‚Äôs putting kids danger go back school next week. anxiety horrible atm. causes Crohns somewhat unknown. definite correlation post viral syndrome‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs disease single simple cause. recent info contact transmission variants? I'm trying decide need fully decontaminate (shower, change clothes, wipe contact points luggage) flying interacting family - double masking basic hand sanitizing would trick. I'd hate risk rubbing variants airport come pick up. least we're vaccinated I'm still super nervous.  hope mandate gets it? vaccines 90-95% effective preventing severe disease.

*At minimum*, prioritize getting doses aged 60+ medical workers everywhere, start giving boosters top protection.

First shots third shots. statistic hopeful one thing doesn‚Äôt take account many private businesses requiring employees mask areas without mandate like I‚Äôm NJ. people person know required wear masks quite frustrating. Glad it‚Äôs mandate don‚Äôt wear personal time sucks wear work. said bet mandate end quicker first time one year plus progress. Universities use serology tests verify vaccination status issue verifications. Countries like Hong Kong Singapore overseas verifications. Ah yes, easy get pregnant. Doesn‚Äôt take months years anyone totally predictable. Clearly, particular vaccine determining factor children. 

Please realize many couples struggle fertility faced tough decisions pandemic whether riskier wait riskier keep trying.  CDC states fully vaccinated two weeks second dose. mind, essentially unvaccinated you‚Äôd received first dose. body hasn‚Äôt chance react vaccine all. infected, you‚Äôd definitely susceptible based time exposure. masks? would variable limiting exposure. Also, infected Delta variant, increases odds exposure well. way know sure, neither masked infected, little protection vaccine yet. lot. current candidates - There's also beginning talk vaccine would work multiple Coronavirus strains SARS-CoV-2 variants. That's ways encouraging. Lastly mRNA tech worked influenza arena now, predominate method still involves eggs. one single bright spot pandemic vaccine research overall really jumped forward.

Novavax hit supply chain issues may holdup US filing, since manufacturing part review process. Still coming, though. fertility specialist too- opportunity get appointment early shots would either side IUI, told could get appointment, whenever was, get ASAP, clinic seeing detrimental fertility effects important safe pregnant.  Lol weeks ago almost bought concert ticket December. cheap, I'm glad didn't. crazy quickly things change. would feel dumb concert ticket. Maybe already genocide implies someone others will. call anti-vax people getting deserts genocide insult victims actual genocide.

political affiliation solid indicator vaccine status. psycho realize even holed another 2 years change damn thing, right?

The virus going continue spreading globally-- think sending kids school going stop spreading India? Brazil?

You think going stop spreading among folks can't work home? think wife stop going hospital treat patients? like blame others this, again: vaccinated January March. like club, partying. reality endemic virus stop spreading even every American stays home: WORLD vaccinates gets immunity infection keep spreading. 

""Easily avoidable"" bullshit argument roughly 90% world. Yeah, I'm sure people India work online like bunch assholes. God. Abbott two amigos resign never allowed hold office Texas again. bad bot. even political comment. smh RemindMe! 20 Days ""is OP's family safe?"" You‚Äôre using Kevin Spacey argument. gives shit they‚Äôre ‚Äúseasoned‚Äù hurting people actions? It‚Äôs simple. mind asking weakened immune system anything? seems crazy got already vaccinated. reason vaccinated people get secure digital certificates? politically impossible would Mark Beast? see, take much get outbreak going. 1 person brought in. area normal vaccination rates likely outbreak all. virus circulating still present danger outbreak need people getting vaccinated sufficient numbers. doctor believes Crohns disease result post viral syndrome. He‚Äôs well known researcher suspect data back up.  fall, Miramax Studios presents: Yesterday Wife. WTF- completely irrelevant inappropriate. Seriously wrong insult physical features people save lives everyday?? Easy solve: instant expulsion. 500$ reward anyone turns fake card. COVID ICU basically doubling labor delivery unit According daily new cases going pretty dramatically last weeks. School going starting pretty soon across country... I'm worried numbers going go pretty fast. Please, everyone, stay safe. sick can't get bed. hospital sent back home. boyfriend says still denial, hence probably sent home. 

People think virus can't touch anyone 60 symptoms short-term, mild... probably due president's ""mild flu"" comments year half ago. reality is, [hitting people 40's harder harder, especially Delta variant. Quite firms sigma names. Aaaaaand (still?) people need hear everything power acknowledge truth. :( numbers part irrelevant, fuel vaccine hesitancy. dont need right now. obviously strong correlation education vaccination. solution problems seems education.  important note there's 25-30% chance natural miscarriage first trimester there's evidence vaccines increased odds. misinformation vaccine causing miscarriages think development natural immunity happening fast enough make major difference here? would rate state today? Get fucked girl named Ashley King 6th grade class, never forget, died bone cancer parents withheld medical treatment Christian science beliefs. remember teacher went visit broke class telling us visit. Religion (and ignorance) makes people terrible things. Gotcha - essentially, idea Covid would take far fewer miscopies get us somewhere terrible, Flu much larger degree changes would need occur become equivalently dangerous. makes implication flu certainly _could_ mutate several ways become similarly threatening, rate spread degree change requires lead less pressing concern (for better worse) (for worse)

Is right? That's horrifying. actually got pregnant shots, every time see OB now, asks I'm vaccinated asking every single patient every single appointment feels strongly need vaccinated encourages every single pregnant person every appointment, case. posts ‚Äúno new normal‚Äô doubt

Angry today we? got triggered lmao make un-vaxxed people pay hospital bills. Don‚Äôt like vaccines? Enjoy bankruptcy. state reports three days week. look 3 Day trend, noisy jumps around, especially hit Friday-Monday gap. 7 Day reliable.   Jesus‚Ä¶ cousin moved fulfill dream someday working Disney. vaccinated wears masks, health issues. Man, feel bad knowing park surrounded belligerent folk mask requirements basic distancing precautions... think also small subset people vocal within social circle would get ""experimental"" vaccine ""harmless"" virus, scared Delta considering vaccine cannot climb particular tree. 

Full FDA approval could serve way - getting vaccine saving face. ""Now safe/official, etc. etc."", sort thing. Lock up. Fuck em! It‚Äôs flat fraud puts everyone risk. I'd say worse though relatively small area, easy commute big cities need (NY Boston) we're already bumping housing shortages pandemic. Fortunately looks like might abating soon, seen bunch new subdivisions going properties largely unused before. builders catch up, get better. concluding paragraph:

In schools choose open without mask mandates limited vaccine uptakes, increased Covid likely. children get vaccinated, masks remain well-researched solution lowering risk getting Covid. Children school, embrace measures keep safe. good portion discontinued due lack need, people back normal jobs. Short redeploying national guard states, manpower isn‚Äôt there. choice protecting thereby protecting baby 4 year old risking covid, it‚Äôs complications death. thing babies born perfect. would even know caused defect.

Didn't think would tell seemingly intelligent person everyone's circumstances different, world revolve around Western health systems, are...  curve look flat right now?  Texas Abotted.  Congratulations. addition vaccines zero time anything, chances getting covid :) 

(6 months father haha)  Though words need take Pfizer shot Sputnik listed, received both.  colitis diagnosis. teacher's medical status literally danger children's health, right know. 

Simple solution mandate, nobody ask. DeSantis appears precisely that, using lives ordinary citizens pawns. 

At risk making conversation political already is, perhaps petition elected officials imagine. state trip sometimes. sincerely idea happy makes me. Good you. get shot, spread word everyone know trusts you. bright spot blight shit news. mean.............  Well think best vax first one get. 

I got AZ April second dose Pfizer. regrets. One could also say don‚Äôt know much longitudinal effects COVID infection   Someone better hurry up.

This pretty much situation, guess good since 2 months. honestly never thought I'd mixing vaccines I'm going live abroad month Sputnik approved EU, living vaccine pass restrictions hell. 

Thanks answer :) 2020 back guess.  states getting hit hardest (aka Southern states) highest rates obesity. Probably coincidence. support putting willingly unvaccinated camps? 

... I'm listening...   Preparing deal forever include actual preparations. Normalizing mask wearing public spaces, example. saying ""shrug live mass death disability guess"". well escalated quickly! LOL Got second dose end march/early april, somewhere around then, i'm around 4-4 half months. I'm hoping boosters ready hit six mark. Good god, believe India Brazil data, bridge sell you. hundreds articles posted data correct. 

There developing world Africa. effective, Pfizer stonks moon  Years brainwashing freedom democracy backfired hilariously sadly country.  may biased.

My cousin followups data collecting hospital part research decide if/when put people vent. Around quarter patients survived time vent 60 days weaned ventilator. three quarters died intubated 60 days weaned mechanical ventilation.

And wasn‚Äôt initial surge mostly elderly nursing home patients.   may late help. two weeks. wild.

Do mean quarantine? two week quarantine? Yea, go back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù two weeks :-)  cool, vast majority people making anti-mask anti-vaccination religion republican. Democrat politicians ones going logic refusing basic safety measures like masks vaccinations‚Ä¶ fact several young children killed sandy hook didn‚Äôt sway anyone away gun beliefs makes think children dying COVID still won‚Äôt convince people ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going get COVID vaccinations‚Äù - president Joe Biden July 21st.  CNN 2015: [August new Seasonality probably plays role. Last year around time cases also sharply increased (Texas well). think idea due hot weather, people tend stay indoors more. Plus, 50 % great highly contagious variant like Delta. Especially since vaccinations homogeneous. social circles, close 100 % vaxxed social circles almost 0 % vaxxed. one people circle gets infected, virus go like wildfire.

Desmar Walkes, Austin-Travis County health authority, said Region ‚Äî made 2.3 million people 11 counties: Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop, Blanco, Burnet, Caldwell, Fayette, Lee, Llano San Saba ‚Äî two staffed ICU beds, according Texas Department State Health Services. important stand support masking contact tracing,"" Walkes said. 

Rome burning. Again, governor likes double down. We've seen time time again. Withholding aid change nothing, fact likely worsen situation 1) DeSantis would pounce opportunity dig even deeper, 2) people *may* able saved likely die.

I solution this, that's sure. I'm politician. tell using lives ordinary citizens pawns try twist lawmaker's arm unacceptable, least me.  quote CDC shared absolutely implying 100% effectiveness. straight said vaccinated people don‚Äôt get sick. 

You know else said vaccine 100% effective? president United States. said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going get COVID vaccinations.‚Äù delta. 

I‚Äôm gonna argue numbers, I‚Äôll say given cdc isn‚Äôt counting breakthroughs, wouldn‚Äôt much confidence *any* breakthrough case number data. 

I‚Äôm also fully vaccinated, matters you. it‚Äôs undeniable vaccines efficacy dramatically overstated CDC, president, media. Better ventilation, eating outside‚Ä¶ listening radio, swear could hear audible eye-rolling everyone room. going late, earliest looking late September. Thanks, appreciate that. tried search criteria faulty, find anything except covid deaths among health care workers. another year would disastrous.

More classmates die? por que los dos? trying suggest critical infrastructure directly affect even people rental assistance, even though infrastructure spending ensures safety heavily used roads, bridges, railways, tunnels airports, spending help lower energy costs people new grids, help combat climate change?

At point, need strategy taper assistance out. Let's use existing unspent funds fill gap move forward. I‚Äôll get back updated stats Delta first arrived US. (I‚Äôll edit comment) Yeehaw. muuh fureeedumb! Ignorance reaping rewards‚Ä¶ wonder teachers unions going get involved tell it‚Äôs none business they‚Äôre vaccinated? don‚Äôt mean rudely either. board mandating teachers get vaccinated. But, it‚Äôs fair tell every parent status. school know safety reasons teacher wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable telling whole town medical status, even vaccinated. well

fuck. Yeah that's discussed. many school districts can‚Äôt even afford new supplies 

Then direct funding them.

It's utterly depressing politicians who've made career defunding public schools attacking teachers calling importance free public education. get extra vaccinations medical shots without OK primary care physician.

Didn't think would tell adults are... state Fauchified, wouldn‚Äôt need 300 ventilators joke lol Lotta COVID central FL moment. would definitely wearing N95 masks come - cloth masks dont cut protecting you.

Also, try avoid driving I-4 (most dangerous highway US runs past Disney) ERs &amp; ICUs full long wait get care.

N95, wash hands &amp; licking doorknobs - probably fine. Sorry, forgot reply! That's fascinating. get sick, suddenly start trusting medical personnel. Stay home stay hospital think it. would explain lot general. Destructive, arguably murderous comes covid.  think so. think Supreme Court recently declared legality employer mandates many hospitals already fired refusers. Must union types health care already gotten axe.  peer-reviewed study concludes ‚Äúabsolutely evidence‚Äù covid-19 vaccines affect fertility women men. 

And meta-analysis showed pregnant recently pregnant women likely need intensive care treatment COVID-19 compared non-pregnant women reproductive age, pregnant women COVID-19 likely deliver preterm compared pregnant women without COVID-19. Furthermore, found babies born mothers COVID-19 likely admitted neonatal unit. 

Not expect information good, unfortunately thought read CA issues statewide mask mandate schools?  Yes, cost freedom people free make bad choices. I‚Äôve encouraging pregnant breastfeeding c patients consider vaccine since came out, formally strongly recommending since joint statement released last week. Every day still patients ask ‚Äúbut safe?‚Äù Like would recommend something you, pregnant patient, wasn‚Äôt safe? I‚Äôm tired.  Oh god stupid. talk idiots. Another sequel Dumb Dumber. vaccinated Gen Xer recently changed careers become elementary school teacher, trouble even getting job interview. Jeez Louise, what's wrong picture? news protest healthcare workers San Diego shot mandate. funny since last people expected it.  maybe maybe virus mutated something dangerous. always wondered this‚Äîeven covid. animal vaccines. 150lb mastiff 10lb yorkie get rabies vaccine dose? didn‚Äôt make sense me. 

Why get vaccine dose 300lbs 160? might want ""family vacation"" first week school - outbreak could bad they're forced shut return masks open, go virtual. first think ridiculous people go trouble find PAY something get free actually provide protection. take pride ignorance wave like flag. really jarring statement. see students every day. don‚Äôt really know another life anymore. aren‚Äôt picking choosing lives dies based bias.

Maybe damn well should! Wear ""Don't Fauci Florida"" shirt ER?"" Pay upfront service (see...I'm compassionate) go Fauci yourself.

Anyone comes un-vaxxed covid symptoms pay upfront. Letting die spite would ‚Äúdon‚Äôt send them‚Äù. 

But think ‚Äúwe send rescind order prohibiting mask mandates‚Äù would probably save lives. 5 vaccine expected months 5-11 need jail. house arrest w/ sensors/cameras doors 30-day stay-at-home period. Automatic fine sensor tripped without justification (food/doctor/pharmacy/hospital visit / essential worker - appointment system set &amp; required trips). Zap future tax returns garnish wages % fine amount paid person can't pay straight away. happens right student loan defaults (a friend mine getting garnished years one semester defaulted federal loans) even crime easy pandemic.

Any better ideas? Let's hope ER near never gets anywhere close that!

I actually feel bad people became doctors nurses 2-3 years ago, covid came worked ground. care getting paid overtime, working much OT much intensity long.... that's crushing. know there's info?  Yes, letting people, potentially children, die, solution.  Going sub school. Masks required there. I'm way supporting him, elected leader state far understand rules, final word. Unfortunately think government much. Texas Florida ! /s... think would great least live we‚Äôd disband teachers union it. submit Risk Assessment document containing proof vaccination. cook military bases vital health welfare us all.  Race bottom continues hospitals don‚Äôt even want patients. chest thumping freedom smile Karens. harsh time. What, there‚Äôs 300 rich republicans Florida want save? That's asked can't transfer patients. know, ICU means really sick easy transport, seems could somehow manage Austin completely beds.  


Our area (N) bumped along zero two ICU beds open month so, today four. county reported two deaths yesterday, possibly why. Sure, letting people die spite (whatever political affiliation) thing. I... I... understand privileged life can't go two years without attending giant music festival literally means life death others hear you. said bit reckless citizens support giv decisions. Like dad driving drunk kids back seat. Still gotta save innocent. basically keeping bubbled away society indefinitely.

Strawman Americans obsessed all-or-nothing thinking 

Strawman destroyed.

Do enjoy debating yourself?  work computer hardware retailer pretty much liberal even Texas. kind comes culture internet weebs like science tech haha hate trump like anime ü§£ about, Fuck No. Put fucking mask. Im sure early grades work US Canada least start age 3 4 depending birthday is. Cuomo creepy disgusting guy, appreciate right thing regarding COVId. Gov. Greg Abbott appealed out-of-state help fight third wave COVID-19 Texas two state‚Äôs largest school districts announced mask mandates
in defiance governor.

Can't make shit up.  Lost first pneumonia 3. Agreed, ever want go child PICU ventilator ever again. anything happens son probably offmyself.  apply separately without agency? Parents threaten leadership send kids back school like it‚Äôs normal this. absolutely info Obama's birthday party? people instructed live lives sort policies governments enact regards COVID.  Mixing two could provide additional benefits well, since use different mechanism.  streets extended gutters, gutters full blood, drains finally scab vermin drown. accumulated filth sex murder foam waists whores politicians look shout ""Save us!"" I'll whisper ""No..‚Äù got mine old fashioned way. 

I earned it!  Cruz Cramer sounds like cancelled sitcom 90's.  coworkers people everything could contain spread people truly feel sorry suffer this. know rough you, I've ICUs patients died seen impact staff myself. even pandemic.

If power excise choose shelter you, would. I'm sorry endure this. Exactly. read something yesterday said Pfizer successful protection. knows? think anyone does. really need speed authorization process, really dangerous people.  sister unvaccinated teacher. underlying health conditions mitigation measures wear mask keep windows open classroom. There's convincing her. prepared pharmacist pull something like went get shot. confirmed pregnant almost sure would pull comment something already ready argument. calmly said ‚Äúok, well remember take ibuprofen take Tylenol instead arm feels sore after‚Äù. 

I felt wave relief said that. read many stories moms getting comment providers friend legitimately ready argument. Maybe spike cases speed results. get venues, either vaccinated, recovered infection tested.


So testing longer free, someone refusing get vaccinated, need test example go restaurant. means need pay pocket. 


I fine that. fcking get vaccinated free. active cases entire pandemic tends that. mean know nothing brother wasn‚Äôt diagnosed primary immunodeficiency twenty years. one says primary immunodeficiency means born it, genetic. Sometimes it‚Äôs invisible, it‚Äôs not. lot doctors don‚Äôt test things

Again know nothing brother except wasn‚Äôt vaccinated. sincerely don‚Äôt get someone works constantly science told it‚Äôs good idea, shuns meat plant based diet, generally science agrees with, except doctor says need little animal protein diet 80/20 plant favored, still couldn‚Äôt believe science enough know Covid don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs best option healthy life Same. signed Pfizer moderna. None called. dildos forget dildos  Maybe not. I'm Republican voter, vote Mr. vote cronies either.  I'd bet large percentage us feel way. vote way either, disenfranchised guess. Interesting. checked area 20+ places could get vaccinated week within 30 minute drive. city still well. year half playing safe, probably silliest thing past weekend walked Bourbon Street New Orleans.

I'd say maybe 10% everyone masked, insane. I'm fully vaxxed Moderna wore mask whole time, figured time finally use experiment. walked Bourbon Street Thursday night Tuesday afternoon I'm feeling nothing. I'd assumed would caught wind anything. Thank you. really helped getting chest. ""Last week saw largest week-over-week percentage increase pediatric COVID-19 cases since start pandemic. data show 71,726 COVID cases children reported last week, almost double 38,654 reported previous friend 11 year old strongly considering lying age get shots school starts. Parents impossible situations this. get wrong Texas leadership seems absolutely awful throughout pandemic, individual Texans favor rejecting vaccine &amp; face masks... even not, long covid thing &amp; uncommon. Speaking personal experience (not covid), serious disease leaves mark. want that, trust me.

This game medic running you, flashing red cross appearing head &amp; back normal. Dr. Gottlieb notice U.S. still 'first wave', never passed 10,000 new cases average per week.

U.S. currently equivalent Nov. 10th 2020, rising rapidly. remember wonderful December 2020 January 2021 were...  Postponed vacation proposal, really feel like home... feel mate make clear end points know variants may come? reasonable decent plan pre-delta waste bin 2 months later.

So matter hear today, matter vaccinated, story mid winter may may hold similarity. Exactly experience moderna well.  opened 9th, makes sense come back good chunk patients made ICU said regret getting shot. People tend change view real quick actually affects *them*. happened military?! battalion got sent Iraq got small pox vaccinated. one *asked* wanted ok it. plenty vaccinations Boot Camp weren‚Äôt optional. Covid apparently treated differently? want shit hole state. started applying jobs couple weeks ago. Cruz willful ignorance, lack ability care anything political power. Dude would thrown family bus votes. Variants bad news may think. immune system make one type antibody exactly fit virus, makes loads slightly different versions. That's people vaccinated original virus also fight Delta - also people can't, everyone's immunity slightly different.

I think keeping antibody levels, much virus circulating, important. either exposed (a small amount, possible, of) virus, getting booster shot. Yikes, suck  impossible say decline protection result waning effect increase Delta prevalence, AFAIK. didn‚Äôt even sore arm. It‚Äôs like injected saline. One common thread see people less severe reactions well hydrated, also case me. W . . F prevent air leakage around sides. read somewhere increases effectiveness surgical mask around 50%. Still nowhere near effective even IMPROPERLY worn N95 let alone properly worn selfish.

And far developed country hoarding way vaccines need.

This bite us ass dangerous variants emerge developing countries. It‚Äôs like modern-day ‚Äúa starving child Africa would kill much food that‚Äôs plate‚Äù. many wasted doses less fortunate countries would benefit from, it‚Äôs beyond frustrating. meth get ya going morning keep ypu going day night next morning night next morning crash, think productivity! #methaccomplishments /s (obviously) support masks vaccines 110% also 110% support people‚Äôs right too! Nah, people charge grasp going numbers lockdown. Instead use Russian Doctrine throwing endless numbers bodies economy whoever makes makes through. Tests free unvaccinated people, absolutely right thing do. gym classes outside, maybe something like would best? got moderna vaccine 1.5 weeks ago. immediately injection intense tingling arm/body ive ever experienced, mean immediately. soon sat felt nausia, white out, grainy vision..went desk, almost fell over. sat down, held called paramedics. laid floor sweating harder ever 15 min finally normalized. fun times..anyone know was? Colorado nice! CDC gathering data breakthrough infections everywhere, running targeted studies could gathering information subset population. Well, still 92% effective hospitalization apparently. Yikes, done yet? 

USA, got vaccine February pregnant. think officiaL CDC recommendation came month later. we're compiling lists I've read these, list appears back June 2020, still contain valid information.

If studies truly suspect, turn debunked, I'll delete post.  admits he‚Äôs idiot made mistake well, thats actually containment works. lol Well, sort created mess....  harm would people getting boosters fake name cause though? 
 
Completely fucking national data? know thing use assess danger make policy personal decisions? 
 
I understand someone particularly threatened (like J&amp;J high-risk area) feeling compelled skirt system safety. 
But we're talking top off, think worth it. keep wearing well-fitted mask avoid large crowds. authorization boosters come pretty soon here. agree here, courts seem agreed past effective implementation depend future rulings. 

My employer pulling ""we can't ask status require HIPPA violation"" card claims corp. lawyers interpretations law.

Hopefully there's big shift mandates FDA approvals. travel Canada sent Ketchup Flavored Lay's potato chips here. ~~Give~~ Sell em oxygen tank send em back home. teacher, least say higher percentage us vaccinated nurses.  Yea. context nurses solders, Trump would like Nixon. lot ways‚Ä¶ Masks also help preventing RSV spread though... Starting think people actually hate children. Tourism would best guess don‚Äôt see link actual data there, least based have[seen doesn‚Äôt appear dangerous. Yea, said party big. Guess what. was. understand nutball governors get hit recall campaigns. would think Democrats maybe half concerned Republicans would sign on.

The complete process takes long, targeted might shake up.

But maybe understand states majority actually support nonsense. I'm Republican friends know single refuser denier among them. nutballs speak us. Nah it‚Äôs Reddit liberal anything goes agenda deleted. know we‚Äôre frustrated holy shit wild sentiment unvaccinated going around sub. Multiple upvoted comments posts Texas florida saying provide lower level care care denied vax. wrong people. agree precedent requiring vaccines I'm vaccines, massive teacher shortage currently. level shortage going significant impacts next year accelerate timeline. Imagine fucking sick hospital. Doc says ""you meningitis,"" use little strength left respond ""no don't."" You‚Äôre fucking cornball. sound like great folks :). work around lot faux news viewers spawn. Facebook addicts. fair expect kids answers. FDA fully approves vaccine, states implement vaccine mandates hefty fines. Supreme Court already ruled back 1904 states that, situation IMO Bruh, look sub. people like ‚Äúi got vacc, I‚Äôm wearing mask anymore‚Äù. Obama held different standard. Plus, he‚Äôs rich af, venture guess mega dollars thrown mitigation.  Yeah, flexibility...the gettin' good.  seem missing point parents STILL ask question. teachers able say it‚Äôs business. remember bleeding heart. trump became president christian followers showed true colors. zero fucks left give. good still care. Thing is, people live vote again, may world worth living anymore. saw meme once. future liberals trying create - picture Star Trek Federation Planets. future Republicans trying create - picture Mad Max. I'd heartbeat. Wife baby weeks ago. vaxxed 20 23 weeks. He‚Äôs perfect it‚Äôs definitely good vaccinated got covid safe never got it.

Get vaccine. makes think haven‚Äôt?  People don‚Äôt recognize risk comes weight. staunchest anti vaxers know personally obese ages. pointed weight thing tune (I guess, don‚Äôt really know they‚Äôre thinking).  population? dense well? Lots tourists over? Glad help! wishing happen, exactly circumstance heading fall. 38 job applications counting, knowing unvaccinated teachers schools want get hired. Abbott Texas. helps, let know [small Israel suggests vaccine impact fertility. 

The numbers study small, start. stupid, also dishonest : ""I want save vaccine need it"", yeah right.  first global pandemic

Previous worldwide epidemics include: Spanish flu, HIV/AIDS pandemic, Third plague pandemic, 1957‚Äì1958 influenza pandemic, 
Hong Kong flu, 1846‚Äì1860 cholera pandemic, 1889‚Äì1890 flu mean, might get downvoted, recently scientist found link use paracetamol kid's development. needs studies really establish anything sure, adds long list of: coffee, pate (liver paste), liquorice root etc, show effects years baby born. personally huge dilemma around vaccine precise reason. know shorter-term effects, nothing long-term. body, yeah sure, get vaccine. pregnant make decisions name future kid well, ""not enough data"" might enough many moms-to-be. Hopefully soon know more, though theory might take years kids need grow first. yet, good able feel administration help states appropriately whether red blue.  right, many politicians foresight anything fat stacks cash they're pocketing table. statement could true politician country regardless political affiliation.

So changing tried decisions crimes still better. truly levels playing field good first step limiting corruption political leaders. Good thing Texas world-class foster care system! ""Everything's bigger Texas."" Unless fetus FL badly?

Clearly, DeSantis done terrible job this, FL's vaccination rates completely average, far state banned mask/vaccine mandates.

Other states (such MO) largely institute mitigation measures, got hit Delta earlier, lower vaccination rates -- yet seemingly seeing cases crest \*much\* lower point.

What gives? Man, ain't human little part wants hear feds say, ""go fish"". 
Or maybe are, assholes caused lose humanity. 

I hope get help need. hope they'll get vaccinated keep getting boosters this... kill thing. 

If every no-Vaxxer die changes tune getting sick, get objectively smarter, less psychopathically driven population. 

I already know two people recovered Delta still debating getting vaccine telling others to... least families went got it. overflow fear no-vaxxers one goes let's hope helps too. Genuinely curious. Why? science behind reasonable. Vaccinated people, infected, spread virus rate unvaccinated people. Legitimately, someone explain me. 

My child marked close contact covid + child (however 3ft, &lt;15 minutes. Whatever hell really means) may keep attending school temp checked twice daily. ass backwards? feel constraints literally meaningless maybe it‚Äôs opinion scientifically okay. I‚Äôm waiting hear pediatrician- I‚Äôve pulled child older child due fact live household. 

If anyone offer insight / shaming please would helpful. well may I‚Äôm overreacting due close family member dying covid around time last year, super sensitive it‚Äôs kids. 

Thanks! Hey paywall that. way see it?  something changes terms danger children I‚Äôm sure see reason rush vaccine trials. Preschool optional, kindergarten states. So, aiming 5 11 school. Pregnant February got vaccinated 4w 8w March/April. sought appt found it. Zero side effects zero covid. ask ob, reason to. 

Everyone get it, different vaccine get recommended pregnant. try searching ""Obama Birthday"" search bar? leads thread: events several hundred people unusual point, even delta cases rising. I'm sure one particularly significant. Quote science redeem me. additional concerns stem added variable people received one dose mRNA vaccines get second dose whatever reason. Back December last year read review different vaccines development lot unknowns (and still are), still known-risk fully vaccinated individuals may able infect others since still significant viral load upper-respiratory tracks NHP vaccine trials. downplayed (and still is), people vaccinated breakthrough infections cropping up, feels like matter time resistant strain emerges. 


I think fairly universal assumption sars-cov-2 virus stay end like flu. I'm hopeful easier path finding near-universal coronavirus vaccine vs finding near-universal flu vaccine since incredible advances science technology last 50 years‚Ä¶.and able ‚Äúcatch it‚Äù (no pun intended) pretty early on. But, know, still ton information don‚Äôt know probably won‚Äôt know while. information can‚Äôt know current technology (omg immune system insanely complex). 


Anyway, sorry rambling, nothing coronavirus research past year half, lot thoughts. Cheers! Clearly, DeSantis done terrible job this, still really get FL spiraling \*this\* much control.

Its vaccination rates completely average. far state banned mask/vaccine mandates. 

Other states (such MO) largely institute mitigation measures, got hit Delta earlier, lower vaccination rates -- yet seemingly seeing cases crest \*much\* lower point.

What gives? doctor, probably vaccines actually function. intended create immune response immune system function much differently depending heavy are. actual physical volume vaccine tiny regardless total body mass. supporters certain orange person almost always ones falling R u n propaganda? mostly killing members ethnic minorities. suspect point number accounts posting conspiracy videos little context trying spread misinfo hoping claim trying refute kind protection downvoted removed.

To OP: Nobodies going watch whole conspiracy video refute give creator ad revenue process. specific questions ask specific questions link (and thereby inevitably spread) disinformation. Technically, yes. would discretion doctor patient, would could full approval Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine open door doctors give booster doses certain fully vaccinated adults even vaccinate children Experts say, technically, yes. they? That's ""As approved product, like medical products, used label discretion health care provider patient,"" said Goodman, also former chief scientist FDA former director agency's Center Biologics Evaluation Research. ""But could complicated Goodman said little safety data available yet comes Covid booster shots, doctors would taking ""I think would follow recommended approvals FDA what's recommended"" Advisory Committee Immunization Practices, said, referring Centers Disease Control Prevention's panel independent advisers helps set vaccination guidelines. ""But clearly all. people get strong beliefs patient family member pressures doctor, may say OK. open door problematic uses."" suspicious. 

best idea google speaker see kind background has. pretty obvious statements practice website social media says incorrect (even without watching video question) thought really loop read headline. nothing changed there? Seems really odd. Every comment mask up. Even schools mask policies cases. aren‚Äôt talking full remote, suggesting. give ID? I'm thinking this. Walmart info go CVS think might able get booster.  ""We've tried nothing we're ideas!"" also little city rules neighboring communities nothing. I'm New Orleans fairly strict rules literally couple miles away rules minimal enforced. Even worse Mississippi hour away never, ever really anything all. People commute daily NOLA Mississippi. federal approach thing could worked imo. Federal government must require mask mandates across state sending single dime. Good idea, im concerned couple things:

1) know people making fake vaccine cards, counter measures place catch (if even possible)

2) negative covid test good, taken festival, isolation period. test negative Friday, walk maskless Saturday, could still catch time. mean hospital rates hard-hit areas put lie rest.   He's right.

Plus kids fuckin gross hell god knows kinda shit they're carrying. like these:  That's awesome. rate, increasing 1 percentage point first shots adults every four days so. Hitting 72 days imagine. fetus infected COVID-19 ? many stuck parents don‚Äôt options‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs cheap stop working stay home kids. Spread contained developing nations. Read news. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article nurse, so....

irrelevant.  ended Bush I. raised taxes (on wealthy) began undoing mess Reagan created...when inevitable recession hit cutting debt hose, right thing let run course (not BS 2007). great part led massive economic boom Clinton, also increased taxes wealthy (shared country large part). made active decision destroying country remain power, better power active goal last 30 years. Pretty good they. started fucking Newt. maybe tried true tactic blame anything border ""I'm racist but's"" eat whatever say.

For example, Texans worried getting vaccinated illegals covid right  think significant uptick schools/companies able mandate it. likely significant amount people outright anti-vax pressed get it. Mandating vaccine schools jobs make easier get vaccine get it.  Yup. literally like week ago, women might swayed haven‚Äôt nearly enough time develop immunity. Part challenge, think, agencies didn‚Äôt know much Delta would upend understanding risk profiles different demographics. Delta clearly massive risk unvaccinated pregnant women. It‚Äôs sad awful, personally would never lump ‚Äústupid antivax‚Äù pile.  stimulus money undocumented people related conversation hand? Lol Fauci Florida! something simple could done prevent this. Like cloth covering face? know.  I'm surprised states sending children back in-person school.

This article + NYT ""‚ÄòThis Really Scary‚Äô: Kids Struggle Long Covid"" article really jarring reads. Read sources linked seems crazy me. Ontario live, pregnant women put category ""high risk"" offered vaccines people, risk COVID pregnancy.

We second child last week wife got vaccinated pregnancy soon able (first dose May, second early July). obviously tiny bit anxious it, since many studies pregnant women yet, *was* data found studies released show adverse effects women babies. Conversely, tons evidence getting COVID pregnant bad. told ""we know 100% harm baby"" vs. ""if get covid pregnant baby could die"" pretty easy choice IMO. 

This say sympathy women subject mixed messaging. simply pointing fear vaccine ridiculous point something prevent virus known deadly, people taking becausse there's remote bogeyman factor vaccine somehow cause unknown harm road. Good you. case China, virus exactly run rampage yet, need do. nations, late, vaccine make feel better.

Also quarantine apply oversea traveller, though locked room break quarantine countries.... spend time jail  Britain, mainly supply issues government imposing 8 - 12 week gap doses.

I think we're truly woods global vaccine production ramps vaccines get updated tackle latest variants. breakthrough variant renders vaccines useless seems almost inevitable. wife 38 weeks pregnant struggled quite bit decision get vaccinated. Ultimately listened OB pro-vaccine seeing several patients get covid pregnant. people unvax understand pregnant women most. sucks rest people reason couldnt get vax protect kids vulnerable people.  DCs mayor needs overthrown. Charging tests smart move. now, people should‚Äôve gotten chance get vaccinated, haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine yet likely either don‚Äôt bother getting reason. It‚Äôll good incentive those. surprise precisely nobody one issue texas sheer number small hospitals since state big. always lot hospitals overflowing since usually send patients far wide better treatment...but big hospitals full hearing stories also small hospitals normally dump well Here's novel idea Drs Ar, try prescribing Tamiflu again. don‚Äôt believe ever ‚Äúsafe‚Äù remove restrictions far politicians concerned. six months we‚Äôll locking next variant.  stuff Texas, Florida Louisiana pump gulf making stupid.

I really hope offer booster shot guys position pretty soon. Although good point statistics certainly tied vaccination levels, seasons also matter. unvaccinated areas South hot hell right everyone indoors.

Also delta affecting lot fully vaccinated people (60%-78% effectiveness infection) we‚Äôre learning lot risk long Covid UK it‚Äôs affecting 6% UK - 3.2 million 11 report. odds ratio confidence interval long Covid (after two shots) goes .4:1 nearly 1:1. Meaning risk long Covid hard pin fully vaccinated could help substantially slightly reduce risk tip, odds ratios can‚Äôt interpreted getting shot used needed, delta scene big way makes sense protect ourselves, families, communities. still pandemic affects everybody  supply bottleneck, supply use. we've seen capacity deliver millions shots per day. we've seen that, 12-15yo made eligible, mad rush get vaccinated - got pretty quickly around 18% vaccinated first shot slowed 2 months later we're 42%. wonder someday ( soon ) realize, virus something fucked with!!! , sadly, see happening, see anything poll says partisanship reason hesitancy.

This number fun, even account fact 6% Texas undocumented *before* 2020, 55% Texans unvaccinated, would almost suggest immigrants nowhere near biggest Covid problem Texas. 

You're narrowing even further, 30% new arrivals. laser focus look like anything concerted effort blame immigrants something Texas itself. Option B: Unvaxxed people die rest us move lives   It‚Äôs job. don‚Äôt scope practice that. pandemic ""over"" =/= disease going away

I'm concerned lack interest public health authority matters, though.


This virus supposedly came certain intermediate host. So, it' normal virus jump one host another.


When jumps, new variants may emerge different selection pressure.


So, important check virus genome whenever find infected animal.

May 2022. already booked venue. holds 180 people, looks like they're planning large wedding (groom's side tons people). hope turns well sound like real 'tempting fate' situation. short answer is: vaccines highly effective preventing hospitalization death, perfect importantly, human mobility almost 2019 levels (Sports arenas, Lollapalooza, etc.) mitigation measure slim. think compare covid numbers respiratory viruses, covid necessarily replacing admissions, possibly adding them.

 mostly agree hospital beds context (although numbers gave annual averages, seasonality headroom), point terms actual danger hospitalization COVID within ""regular"" respiratory problems are, less accept risk ""regular"" respiratory problems without feeling need switch everything distance learning banning playdates. false. science supports getting vaccine.

**[Vaccine Disinformation sure paying disinformation campaign best guess Russian Manufacturing firm created Sputnik Vaccine. (Timestamp: 4:00 in) city's FB group I've already argued even have.   bright side, based lot major counties Florida decently high vaccination rates... Especially Miami-Dade, Delta going continue run rampant schools everything else open. time peak hurricane season. see take much get small measles outbreak going, also see small outbreak quickly stifled.

&amp;#x200B;

... small outbreak gotten bigger... yea... would've become dangerous problem.

... small outbreak get bigger? Two main reasons see: pre-existing vaccination rates higher compliance quarantine related measures helped mitigate spread.

&amp;#x200B;

In end, known, pre-prepared-for problem less dangerous ongoing, already control, still mutating problem. One day, covid measles could present levels danger, then, continue get daily proof already widely distributed new virus dangerous already well contained virus, vaccines mitigation main tools case. Twitter gets lot attention, twenty times votes story Cuomo resigning. must make profit news every week. Yes, usual ones. Texas also this: wondering store managed awesome vax rate? management proactive? large retail store rural midwest almost one getting vaxxed despite offered pharmacy. one, including management, seems care. yes, workers catching Covid. fucked make higher level name ""Level Florida"" Oh look, got stuck ventilator‚Ä¶..  Jesus. number new cases higher point pandemic signs slowing. suspicious number Monday (28,317) supposedly exactly wrong number Sunday (28,317).

I think likely another error. attachment/infectivity mechanism viral mRNA reaches cell. still need large enough 'dose' viral particles truly expose still probably isnt happening methods fomite transmission. Especially contact surfaces, sunlight, heat, etc breaking samples time land. students. parents. everyone be. reason? Seriously. I'm pregnant, what? people feelings pregnant. science says okay. People going kill unborn children reluctance believe science.  


Being pregnant magically give pass idiot. Yes... ""destroyed"" economy California...  worries. I've seen majority articles, familiar points trying make. absolutely acknowledge potential reduced vaccine efficacy, like seen delta. think several things working likelihood complete immune evasion generated vaccination. mean think boosters necessary anything like that. scenario previous vaccination provides protection whatsoever extremely unlikely opinion. Thanks links! Vaccines reduce viral shedding Delta. Everything else said right however. usually stop loading page text loads, easier Desktop mobile. Thank you! Love  Regarding contact tracing, CDC ""An infected person spread COVID-19 starting 48 hours (or 2 days) person symptoms tests positive.""

Is still correct delta variant?   fun troll. I've actually really started enjoy trolling people like Twitter, usually respond followers duuuuuumb. Interesting. Everyone team work vaxxed. everyone team professional average intelligence, might contributing factor. 

I came back family reunion strong correlation IQ vax status. Say want guy, despite past kidnappings unruly children, Bowser really cares health safety constituents. Well Delta close sort immunity. half country vaccinated fully half delta ravaging like wildfire. peaks, would assume large part population sort immunity - least hospitalization death

Vaccines return normal life - including ending mask mandates. Delta hopefully bump - granted big bump - road.

Don‚Äôt get people saying everyone 90% country would vaccinated know probably never going happen home abroad Absolutely! asked really consider price that‚Äôs worth risk. gets covid, complications, etc - matter risk - what‚Äôs price worth paying? That‚Äôs you, there‚Äôs zillion considerations, priceless sounds right :). Yeah, there's lot dumb people spreading mask vaccine fear, politicians deserve blame too. mean, Joe Biden now, little better, still pushing people go back school work. additional stimulus talk all. wonder say this. fake card basically thing forged government document. - could probably play enough gymnastics turn felony. Right? cancel annual family vacation Myrtle Beach last year, year out, parents booked condo next year (March) I'm buying plane tickets yet. Starting get feeling thing going stop kills us all. Vaccines can't stop it, masks stop it, washing hands 50 billion times day stop it. I'm pregnant zero special sympathy pregnant women get vaccinated now. studies clearly show demonstrable risk, meanwhile clear risk Covid bad things happening get COVID.  


It makes furious.  


I'm new mom FB groups. people post questions like ""Should get vaccinated, plz nice me?"" idiot post ""Covid cause miscarriages"" zero linked scientific sources. they'll post Really?

Then post linked study, listen care. People want afraid.  


I think people's fear unknown always greater fear something quantifiable, like COVID risk. yhou make decisions based INFO now, scientific info says get vaccinated.  


What's worse getting vaccinated help PROTECT baby, transferring immunity them. unvaccinated pregnant women hurting future children.  


Ugh. worst.  doubt he‚Äôs paid. I‚Äôm paid agree entirely. Masks charade. saying don‚Äôt work, mandates living like eradicate virus moronic. It‚Äôs stay forever. Also *mandatory* able participate aspects public life, *mandatory* general. test vaccination needed enter restaurants, concerts, etc. N95 may protect well, N99 surely does.

I'm less troubled see completely abandon argument next case. means never sincere begin with. Fair. Need keep numbers accurate reliable. averages still highest ever hospitals full.  Novavax different? 

I thought AZ less old style vaccine?  Trump started ""kick someone else"" strategy dealing coronavirus, persists.

The mayor, spine all, would issue mandate let courts sort out.  Thanks balanced common sense response typically see here. R0 Delta high high-end estimate puts close smallpox, seems layman's perspective wave going put previous ones shame we're still front edge it. can't help think going get way way way uglier next weeks burning much quickly previous waves.

Small pox burn out. stamped massive worldwide vaccination effort. time whole world declared war virus. won, determined end this. take vaccinating whole world.   now? Isn‚Äôt wanted restrictions protecting people covid? incompetent fool. Religion. People fundamentalist christians think come election time religious leaders south simply tell followers vote Republicans god wants. 

Seriously, remove religion element Texas blue. Uuuuuf, yeah, based experience US... lifting restrictions + Delta getting started recipe success. Thanks info. mother-in-law Chile got 2 doses Sinovac. I'm sure know, they're starting 3rd shot booster, AstraZeneca age group. asked look whether would good idea get booster.... looking like yes. That‚Äôs actually less icu capacity Covid thought think article title wants convey Get job, kid. don‚Äôt think Sandy Hook Parkland one little anecdote personal experience.. perfectly fine 2 weeks second dose moderna visited antivax family tried convincing government plot ton unreported cases myocarditis/pericarditis young adult men, cohort. got stressed bad anxiety actually started making heart hurt. reassure fine delving deeper literature. soon started feeling 100% confident made right choice, felt completely back normal. Dont overlook stress anxiety, it'll kill much faster vaccine allegedly Congratulations you!! Wishing chubby, cuddly, amazing smelling babies sleep night right away!!  live Bucks, one local hospitals there. rehab. Good luck! Covid endemic, it‚Äôs time reassess want live society going forward.

We‚Äôve already done this. 

Get vaccinated move on. Abusing use present statistics order get 99.9% lying opinion. wondering, side PA? I'm imagining Philadelphia area? Unpopular (but accurate) take. going hard vaccine Africa. Hard in.....it's going work, realistically.

You think vaccines hesitancy bad US? large areas entire continent, traditional medicine favored modern science. Many Africans shrug medical treatments things right front killing huge percentages population. Covid vaccinations? good chance go lock everyone agrees vaccinate. letting people get disease option. would think people weight problem already know unhealthy. problem, addictive tendencies feel little sorry ones struggling it. says 14% people COVID patients. minimize COVID that's issue. must additional capacity begin with.

For context: that's 14% covid regular hospital beds, ICU. Texas health department publish number covid ICU patients. regional organization tracks hospitalization Houston surrounding areas. Covid patients taking 30% ICU capacity. increase 7% month ago. CDC even numbers Whoo-hoo! Look guys! Using tax payer money (their wages) everything make sure many people harmed killed possible!  
What dedication! 


/S, like, lots  That's exactly I'm saying. 

COVID could give miscarriage, vaccines. got second dose Pfizer hard decision make, weight shoulders it. I, too, hoping wait delivery (I‚Äôm 36 weeks), I‚Äôm glad bit bullet decided go it. even eradicated polio yet? heck anyone think we're gonna knock Omega strain mutates? heard much time reading sub that. Walmart pay enough. They're scared require vaccines, able fill jobs.  Thanks. Also, know didn‚Äôt come across tone, don‚Äôt hate anything. lot us best difficult circumstances. Something way phrased ‚Äúim following rules anymore FREEDOM‚Äù rubbed wrong way Advice ""get Pfizer available, get AZ even get bad Sydney"".

I'm group 1B ITP overly severe, public-facing work.  DeSantis personally call Biden camera those. Yeah, isn‚Äôt true, least US: ‚ÄúThe American College Obstetrics Gynecology recommends eligible persons, including pregnant lactating individuals, receive COVID vaccine vaccines series.‚Äù Source:  Who's they? moment, virus unvaccinated dictating direction restrictions going. science tells hell up. ""They"" trying keep us killing directly Covid transmission indirectly overloaded healthcare system. Wait...what happened ""Dont Fauci Florida""....!?

I guess include asking nicely needed medical supplies, vaccine. think good fact check, article bit puff piece. Especially concerning actual conditions border they‚Äôre going press release administration. Trump Biden caught trying cover what‚Äôs really going there, would expected dig little deeper it.

Without would hard convince anyone seriously pushes argument, reduces ‚ÄúThe officials charge say isn‚Äôt problem.‚Äù us will, we'll remember electric grid problems.

But, bulk Abbott's base hate masks, refuse get vaccinated, think virus hoax. 

It's frustrating surges past year half, still people refuse take virus seriously refuse get vaccinated.

Yesterday NPR played audio anti mask rally Florida 10 year old girl went mic said ""masks dumb,"" feel bad mad parents. lucky person got first dose! *Sad Thai noises*  talking SEVERE cases. Modt SEVERE cases vaccinated people making kids take risk wouldn't. risk, yes, objectively much smaller risk unvaccinated adult would take on. always agreed ""zero risk"" requirement life, somewhere zero ""risk unvaccinated adult high spread"" exists level risk person find acceptable, level may differ person person. agree. much darkness days. broken country. stupid! Also it‚Äôs confusing say ‚ÄúICU beds‚Äù it‚Äôs really beds mean (although icu beds different usually floor beds) really means icu rooms slots. say can‚Äôt admit patient don‚Äôt bed, it‚Äôs don‚Äôt room spot (which also refers whether staff cover room).

Anyways, differences handful things. beds staffed ICU nurses extensive training managing patients critically ill often intubated (on ventilator), continuous dialysis (unfortunately many critically ill patients end kidney failure, usually temporary always), vasopressor medications keep blood pressure getting low (requires careful attention dosed incorrectly kill you, tube feedings (because breathing tube). nurses 2-1 ratio (1 nurse 2 patients unlike floor ratio higher). doesn‚Äôt include respiratory therapists (actually shorter nurses worst surge here) manage ventilators help suctioning oral care patients breathing tubes (don‚Äôt google mucous plug, it‚Äôs insane much suctioning oral care intubated patient requires). ICU physicians responsible managing bunch critically ill patients writing orders nurses need above, organizing consults billion doctors need help manage critically ill patients like kidney doctors infectious disease specialists, writing notes 20 plus critically ill patients, placing invasive monitoring devices, line artery measures blood pressure, line neck give vasopressor meds through, line chest get dialysis through, breathing tube, etc. Anyone who‚Äôs intubated needs daily labs drawn sticking artery (not vein) assess well ventilator oxygenating them. also need daily chest x rays potentially imaging requires tech come around take images. patients also need seen physical occupational therapy, speech pathology, etc. 

Okay ended handful things go. South American countries like Brazil Argentina also trending ton, remains seen whether Sinovac, overall trend.

Chile detected Delta variant month ago, we'll see month happens institutions built normal time where. pandemics need proactive rather reactive. Absolute insanity happening there, certain people politicized pandemic. I‚Äôm vaccinated fear long term affects Covid also. vaccine protects dead long term affects. I‚Äôm educated HIPPA laws, don‚Äôt think provider ignore patient pretend don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre greeted public.  could wrong‚Ä¶ Yup September 7 law office work says going back. shit show. focusing trying find something else keep going insane.  submission linking businessinsider.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  simply need google opposite said read research. several posts made related issues week spoken like someone cant take slightest adversity. push difficulty. yet complain pushing difficulty. Unfortunately, people believe numbers fake, purposely inflated instill fear control people. hope headlines make difference someone, though, get vaccinated basics: hand washing, etc. Twitter ban Congress nope, see websites podcasts details believed. opinions fringe doctors outweigh concensus opinion medical community. Apps written confirm immunization secure way, US even central database this. screwed there's nothing carry around forged unless lot money spent. True that, population smaller California. Thanks. want Publix sub. Chicken tenders.. üòÇ logic waiting? mother gets Covid, might die. mother gets vaccinated, mother survive, way baby survive. Texas: Big talk leaders best times, begging help worst times. 

Rinse. Lather. Repeat. Whoa cannot believe kind government bigger state level could come help. Fucking wild. hear you. Luckily, mine fully vaxxed I'm concerned well go COVID fits starts beginning school year. 

Thanks tip, I'll check out! People always follow ""But vaccine tech new, basing older vaccine types apples apples"" course sinister intent get people vaccinate.

We've new era warfare many years now, understand it.

Many ardent supporters US 2nd amendment live US.

Just pay thousand college kids 2nd language minimum wage fuck internet countries around world. old days countries put boots ground bullets enemy.

For decades interests convinced us shoot ourselves. Sowing vaccine doubt pandemic kill millions. win bad guys. boat. Mine 10. go back Sept 2 virtual option currently. I'm NJ, reinstated mask mandate inside schools. I'm crossing fingers within next weeks they'll decide start virtually, least kids protected. 

I add I'm ER nurse last year half seen worst covid, still scared right coming school year. Science require belief, requires understanding comprehension. 
 
Something \*may not\* considering 'I believe science' comment.  like virus  it‚Äôs easy don‚Äôt professional athletes wear masks competing? Yes, that‚Äôs pool users, gym users. Every gym within 30 miles could still function fine. number gym users per capita lot higher number competitive swimmers.

For medical therapy pools, hospital affiliated ones area extended hours reserved individual time slots nobody exercised groups. 

It would better enforced vaccine mandates public use spaces like pools. can‚Äôt politics. areas don‚Äôt effective way avoid fraud. antivaxxers actively lie vaccine status. like lie wearing masks.

We‚Äôd regularly go visitors remind stay masked they‚Äôd asked leave. Oh, they‚Äôd say. wore masks time, someone complained wasn‚Äôt them, must mistake. we‚Äôd point cameras ask thought decoration. see every public area. *your aunt might antivax*  One rights parents keep kids taken away foster care, right vaccinate, along cutting hair deny special education. you‚Äôll trust wrong numbers CDC even know they‚Äôre wrong? You‚Äôll surprised find Asia, gyms never dropped masking requirement. People gotten used lifting weights mask on.  bots annoying imagine vaccine gets full approval see universities, businesses gov entities requiring vaccinations. It‚Äôs gonna way convince people. Carrot doesn‚Äôt work. Time stick. Full FDA approval gives everyone permission get stick.  Everybody‚Äôs different. Lots anecdotes pointing different directions amongst friends/family. Perhaps unexpectedly, people know strongest negative reactions Pfizer.

I Moderna, nothing first shot. Second shot, four-six hours day felt like flu sucked. cleared bizarrely quickly basically 100% dinner.

IMO, people big negative reactions likely feel compelled share stories makes look worse is. guidance changed. say vaccinated people test exposed (I remember quarantine, I'd guess so). guess I'm sure comment removed, since part civil discussion taking place, contains less profanity post responding. Please explain. Bigger briskets, bigger power cuts. Yes, seems silly actually perks given sensibly vaccinated. honestly hope continues, course there's still plenty time even virus. know anyone personally (although know second/third hand), *expect* get case point.  friend said sister law got third dose. walked difficult questions asked. 60. read thread man also got third dose - told second dose forgotten card again, got jabbed without questions. people US visas reside US also Canadian visa? allowed travel Canada? Depends fact checking. Assuming union guy correct, mean COVID numbers heavily driven immigrants? Revoke laws, everyone enough common sense never hurt anyone! breaking news?

Plenty EU countries hit ago discount kids. Simply 

1 Vaccines wear off.

2 protect cannot get vaxxed, vulnarable people, preggos kids (and muppets won't). agree totally. maybe wait year two, planned thing already? instance, neither surprise pregnancies, women still 20s; one couple actively seeing fertility specialists, lesbian couple they're.... something. 

Edit: think it, one mom couple 2 actually vaxxed, since carrying child guess use egg? honestly know sure. Feels like waste dose vaccine allocation massive portion planet isn‚Äôt vaccinated yet.  Work perinatology, recommend vaccine pregnant patients. risk contracting Covid pregnant far exceeds unknown concerns taking vaccine, time seem insignificant compared Covid. mother fetus. Virtually pre-existing condition would increase risk reaction vaccine also increases risk dying Covid. Maybe also remind husband unborn child shares half DNA/can‚Äôt get vaccinated potentially risking baby‚Äôs life.   It‚Äôs almost certainty point I‚Äôve seen overwhelming anecdotal evidence conservatives support him. find ways get people vaccinated. least get UK levels. outbreak turned mild, lots places (Germany included) far vaccination rates among people 65+. vaccination campaign basically collapsed past weeks. might get going again. Though quite unfortunate travelers. literally needs vaccinated diseases RN. stupid? vaccinated coworker traveled cross country Florida work came back Covid. Spent full day office back west coast realized sick. Infection scariness aside, really illustrated Florida going drag us it. area 80% vaccinated starting enjoy benefits that‚Ä¶ more, guess.

Edit add: SUPER CAREFUL. Masked constantly. hella fucked. Cowardice. Plain simple. first mistake attempting reason people. immune logic facts. weren't, believe believe. know could change minds, bad personal experience. Yeah, I've heard KS class exposed still go school wear masks around classes. Although lot teachers saying way really dumb, harder teach teaching present class people online time, it'd much easier sent exposed home teach whole class online. mention much safer. course go stupid ass way. don‚Äôt think enough brain capacity that. Selfishness hatred filled up. would shocked many nurses (nationwide, south/bible belt) EXTREMELY religious...and either vocal usual evangelical proclivities...which would lead one think many nurses may let one die (or slow process could) believe ''it's god's will/plan you, patient''. place nuts. Many people said wouldn't.

They said would reduce chance infected, hospitalized, put ventilator, dying.

The vaccine still great.

But perpetuate ""it never meant keep getting sick"" mantra. worry, I'm sure pharmaceutical industry develop many treatments children's lifelong disabilities marginal cost, know profits really matter. !remindme 14 days countries high population densities well. always factor England high numbers. must keep mind healthy user bias. returning school cases rising vaccination mandate? vaccine 5 12 years age group expected ? right delivery. 24 weeks.  Cries Johnson &amp; Johnson   Nope. There's stimulus coming.

Quite frankly, point, there's really reason considering it. vaccines available demand. Lockdowns, quarantines, NPIs restrictions stop-gaps that. like, want variant farms something...boggles mind, truly. half day remember correctly. says wasn‚Äôt request Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday aware request asked it, TRUE‚Ä¶. terrifying he‚Äôs sidestepped fix state‚Ä¶.
‚ÄúI heard that, check see that‚Äôs true not,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúI would honestly doubt that‚Äôs true, I‚Äôll look. lot stuff stockpiled last year half department emergency management. requests across desk. haven‚Äôt notified that.‚Äù  already hearing know what? sympathy ""Convergence"" Republican thing, everybody either vaccinated, COVID, died. death toll smaller would last year, still high. Florida, older people vaccinated less risky die less.

Now Delta increasing deaths younger people, Republicans budging convergence. sucks. honeymoon south beach one week lol.  boat sinking, grab nearest flotation device. life preserver, others, life jacket. might access life boat. Either way boat goes down, going glad choose swim nothing. Restrictions due pandemic shouldn‚Äôt framed taking away rights

I'll honest, newspeak.

Pandemic restrictions taking away rights.

Of course make valid argument cases (like pandemic), acceptable rights taken away, make argument ""framed"" sit well me. here, got multiple immunocompromised adults social circle, plus newborns toddlers worry :( pubs NOBODY masked.

I think ever realistic expect people mask bars/clubs. People go places socialise get close other. Exactly! son height weighs 10 pounds less MIL. lot vaccinated people watching loved ones fall anti vaccine rabbit hole horrible heart breaking outcomes.  SCC shacks go 600K eat pencil shavings drink cod liver oil get this. made bed, go lie it. entire American ~~health~~ system described one sentence.

Fixed Yes, *number* breakthrough cases surprising, given early statements made vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness. Also, findings fully vaccinated people much viral load non-vaccinated people easily spread virus surprising, given CDC saying months ago. 

This April:

‚ÄúVaccinated people carry virus ‚Äî don‚Äôt get sick,‚Äù Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director CDC, told MSNBC‚Äôs Rachel Maddow Tuesday. That‚Äôs ‚Äúnot clinical trials, it‚Äôs also real-world think anybody reading April taking face value every reason surprised what‚Äôs happening breakthrough infections hospitalizations now. sound excited ! He'll blame ""illegal"" Mexicans state tilting windmills hero Quixote. Mainers? would cool decided Mainiacs instead! Highest community transmission developing nations vaccines‚Ä¶  continually extending eviction moratorium simply financially tenable. Someone pay maintenance, mortgages expenses there's limit ability continue provide rental assistance. [Bypass paywalls plugin right  childish notion freedom amounts ""nyah nyah, can't tell do!"" prefer fun gun hyenas either side, bat mallet work suppose. That's fair, that's choice

If wanna wear mask good Sadly, think right. Same. I‚Äôm half tempted lie 11 year old‚Äôs birthday try get protection goes back school. He‚Äôs already 5‚Äô3‚Äù hundred pounds -bigger many adults able get it. Make EUA let parents pediatricians decide kids like him! word/hope Dade County? wife goes back next week I'm terrified.  I'm interested antibody response 2 vaccines plus breakthrough mild asymptomatic infection. point going vaxxed sooner later get exposed covid pre-pandemic social interactions (partying masks, sharing drinks, etc.). post-vaccine infection keeps antibodies high level limit transmitability disease, would die given enough time.  No, data 7/31/2021 last updated 8/4. 4.5% kids symptomatic COVID (which small percent already), symptoms beyond 4 üò¨ first day school half people don‚Äôt wear masks follow guidelines.  Agreed. I‚Äôm auditor state much dislike sitting desk spreadsheets day, beats dealing death daily basis.   way worded what? literally quoted headline article. Exactly issue it‚Äôs hoping there‚Äôd central system place places started requiring vaccine. paper card picture phone. state doesn‚Äôt way look records. Kids die number 30+ years old adults

I want minimize loss child -- insanely tragic -- COVID mortality risks much, much, much lower children adults mocking propaganda mask wearing literally child abuse. Hundreds die. Deaths lagged infection 22 days  though treatment much better pt side, dexamethasone high supplemented oxygen respiratory therapy ECMO less vents. 1 percent die running 100k infection week, 3 weeks 1000 dead week. Delta variant estimated R naught R0 6.5 indicating person infected infect average 6 others. Pt population younger 85 percent 65 population vaccinated survival rates better. people cared got vaccinated stopped worrying it. Delta showing much cases Chile? Last checked Gamma/Lambda. kept vaccinated people need mind boggles comment downvoted.  


I'll take harsh truthful reality sweet deadly lies day. Seems mentality wide spread I'd thought started. :( Good point. Thank you. want lose world relevance? it, cripple kill youngest.

Doctor: Well isn‚Äôt data protect decision, good luck! Oh won‚Äôt prescribe anything basis. Oh sick? Find another doctor! Pffft nonsense talking about, know root human suffering Republicans? true, also need prepare eventual wave infections happen here. may serious first year another wave can't afford sacrifice others want favor needed most. west coast needs help? Sure, cheering deaths. need hear south maxima culpa

And mean it.  Delta literally ripped India. easier virus transmits, faster going run hosts. Regardless get immunity (natural vaccine), got immunity. strong, long, etc. besides point.

Vaccines help keeping cases per 100k much lower slow growth, eliminate entirely. think difference anything total population huge difference? US 160 million fully vaxed UK around 50 Million. Going numbers US well. They‚Äôre overworked. time work out. bullshit? Perma ban. End story.  opposite true.

""As result, hospitals healthcare systems lost least $323 billion 2020, according recent AHA Could also sample bias.

I'm happy able information fingertips make informed decision. misinformation spread like wildfire hard undo. sister still hesitant fertility concerns, although proven factually inaccurate. I've sent countless pieces information smart cookie. can't believe easily misinformation entrenched people false beliefs. think pretty reasonable think vaccine relation ongoing pregnancies. Many people spoken disrupted menstrual cycles, concerning. initial vaccine trials, pregnant women also included - understandable, also meant data collected potential side effects.

I remember seeing folks several months ago local subreddit got downvoted recommending pregnant ladies talk OB vaccine. Perhaps came across wrong way - saying ""talk doctor specific situation"" exactly anti-vax sentiment. Chances doctor going recommend it, since seems much safer alternative. baby 10 days ago. OB practice highly recommended vaccine 1st trimester it‚Äôs pretty standard US. side effects baby antibody protection now. glad this.
