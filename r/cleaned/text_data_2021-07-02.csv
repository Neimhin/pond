0,2021-07-02,"  first world country going shut another year Covid vaccines available Covid zero? That’s gonna happen.

The rate mentioned 100% relevant That's unfortunate. Hopefully, does. dont know people “confused“ masks. It’s simple reason confusing feelings wanting wear mask.

Lets look whats happening. Vaccination high enough create safe environment. Delta variant noted contagious showing up.
FLASH BACK 2020, wear masks prevent spread. 

Information vaccines vs delta variant developing atm looks promising developing.
Side note: recommend masks protect unvaccinated.

There confusion, tldr dont 100% certainty vaccine interaction delta. keep people safe literally protect yourself. Seasons affect severity symptoms. Independently r0 is, we’re seeing UK broken chain cases hospitalizations/deaths. studies Pfizwr seem show 90% sterilizing, 95% mild, 99.99% (whatever 100%) serious/death. (CDC others)

For Delta drops 79%, 88-90%, unsure lack data similar. (Israel)

Still great, great. Moderna essentially same.  bad never happen :D .90% positivity still really good. example, elbow handshake (instead cheek kisses) could become forever. memory B Cell? Whatever happens travelers pandemic making. Stay home. Same. got soon could lucky eligible lot people age, also got second dose 7 days ago. uncle says he'd rather die get vaccine understand. whole family feels elderly laws live hope regret it. This. irrelevant long Rt 1,0 hospitalization cases 0. 42 days local shutdowns trick. 
Or 365 days local shutdowns less effective ideally. Since we're fairy land now, they'd actually prefer Super Vaccine X protects death itself. recreation pool work Philadelphia, pretty much one, staff patrons, wears mask. Summer camp start Tuesday however, children camp along counselors wear masks inside rec building. think may wear pool deck well obviously wear pool. Yeah, won’t happen opinion. CFR US vastly different; barely lower last summer.

The UK places vaccinating exclusively elderly high uptake several times lower CFR, much less order magnitude difference expect (under-30's something like 0.05% CFR, yet UK's CFR remains many times higher). Whether low enough let remaining unvaccinated catch COVID seems borderline. again, buying time extremely high value.    amazing news, exactly get young people safely vaccinated soon possible get lives back. wish Germany would same. Something tells one day microscope they'll find variant looks like Florida man.  Los Angeles County today: 549 new cases, positivity rate 0.90%. great terrible. social ""restrictions"" norms could become ""forever"", yes.  *everywhere low vaccination rates. Fixed Full approval would least mean could make mandatory military. ideas Wikipedia list emergency? thing is, China willing work WHO. hard see China would give G7-led investigation sort meaningful access. That's like Russia asking investigate election security US.  I’m talking spread cases. I’m talking historical percent cases resulted deaths vulnerable vaccinated.  end year everyone 60 meant offered pfizer. Everyone get astra health officials disagree politicians say one 60 astra. still get want. 

The prime minister came pretty vague ""4 stage strategy"" moving past caronavirus. giving specific dates targets super shit country opening vaccinated people sometime next year vaccine ""targets"" met. talking vaccine passports travellers. 

It's going anything like across next decade though. I'd surprised still closed end next year. 


It's interesting watching culture change around vaccine though. Antivaxers used almost get equal platform seem scurge media. can't really say that. general trend millenia toward lower lethality, viable path actual evolutionary pressure direction. Even then, along trendline mutations take drunken walk. rates (including Rt) seasonal. 
Unfortunately spring ""break"" ended midsummer solstice Rt 1,0. Rt 1,0 cases (including hospitalized intensive care) continue rise geometrically. forever shut down, please That’s everyone world luxury choice. countries use vaccines used countries, seek regulatory approvals. don’t deserve disadvantaged that.

There’s difference approval use, discriminating someone he/she injected vaccine authorized approved local health authority. mean say “can’t shut forever” seriously suggesting shutting forever. Well, people get Covid vaccine die.

But people drink water also die.

And people don’t get Covid vaccine.

So mean, technically… America Fucked…… excuse language that’s truth. Calling July 4th weekend cases skyrocket everywhere Official numbers joke. like 1,400,000 ...

- [I Believe One Million Indians Already Died COVID, Says Mathematician Murad [A Million Indians Likely Died End Second Covid Wave, Says Pandemic new UK wave happened natural ""spring break"" spread seasonal viruses decreases considerably (ie. infection rate Rt seasonal). last spring - summer new rise cases Europe started end June - early July. year delta strain brought rise 1-2 weeks forward higher baseline spring decline seriously lagging last year. Last year hospitalization capacity problems started appear September - October - November timeframe. anyone wants vaccines it. Duh. Thank you. great weekend! Albania given option receive donated vaccines different manufacturers price relevant. I'm trying make equivalence, opposite. That's point. corona vaccines. nations Eastern Europe used emergency approval use Russian Chinese vvaccines.they decided usual approval process lower vaccines hesitancy make sure unknown side effects. England everything open apart night clubs, masks still mandatory indoor, that’s far know. keep mind they’re schools still open classes presence.  Happy cake day! Like, sporadic remission? markers? West Loop still one two places wear masks, basically done with. throw 19 20 bus?  False equivalence. Make points good faith, thank you.

Likely AZ, given way, way cheaper.  They're probably lying maybe themselves. 

Folks general need get better recognizing bad faith arguments actors. usually pretty transparent reason difficult many pick on. think even low vaccination states link cases deaths broken. Let's see - Missouri 73% 65+ vaccinated, accounted 80% deaths. yeah may small uptick deaths mostly going unnecessary suffering ranging sniffles extended hospital stay 6 figure bill. put perspective. roughly 6 million people living Denmark, donated 3 million vaccines, thats like Usa donated 164 million vaccines, (wouldnt unlikely thing vaccine hessitation there) wasn’t commenting vaccination policy. commenting statement link wasn’t broken it’s definitely vastly different. SAR published PHE lower bound relies NHS Test Trace system. kind depends region mixture variants point. example states &lt; 10% delta variant states like Missouri around 70% delta variant. 1 dose Pfizer 30% effective delta variant (that's effectiveness illness probably higher hospitalization). 2 doses 80-88% effective delta. effectiveness higher rest strains still going around. read somewhere real number 3 million +. Nearly everyone india knows someone died disease course shut forever. 
Human societies done last 5000+ years plague epidemics. Even 25000 years corona viruses. anti vaxxers literally means finally truth got published somewhere evil powers squashed forcing retracted 

in fact, retraction PROVES true is!

I talk people lot 100% predictable say Ah, okay. ""an unforced curfew"" UK currently doing?  Can’t wait go next month!!!

*stares nervously* We've zero cases long time, relaxed restrictions low vaccination rates. Fleeting transmission seen number different settings

In Portugal can't give everyone first doses yet; makes sense buy weeks so. know vaccine uptake, 1% CFR nearly good UK has. Seattle dropped mask requirement 2 days ago. Still lots people wearing here. looks like hospitalizations rise linear there, different exponentially. 

Wrong. _looks_ linear linear scale, look log scale, linear roughly straight, actually indicates exponential exponentially rising positive tests literally shows balance vaccination efficacy symptoms, severe symptoms delta variant

Wrong. Regardless vaccine effectivness (Even 99.9999%), exponential growth cases results exponential growth hospitalisation (Just slower growth vaccines work.

Of course. got shot 11AM. night sleep 5AM (this thing Astrazeneca first shot too), really hard shivers, felt hot cold time.

Chicken soup might also help lot could uncomfortable area thats currently suffering heat. Maybe let cool bit? Mind sharing first presented you? vaccine received? placebo effect protect covid. However real vaccination will, itll also help protect vulnerable loved ones:) Oh, yes...I think deaths could lower, based UK seeing. need better vaccinations 29-30 crowd. would make great difference.

Though state reopen school anytime sooner. think anglophone Canada area us culturally described yankeeland, particularly far apart.

I agree that, however initial point (not much discussion) US general Québec culture quite different anglophone Canada.

Anyone edit Wikipedia quality sources rarely checked.  point 12+ adults. Obviously way 80+. NYC NZ covid zero? NZ isolates rest world (I know possible) NZ would need vaccinations. tested positive Missouri city despite vaccinated. Got lying coworker claimed vaccinated wasn't. anger real. followed every CDC guideline, got vaccinated, still got bullshit.

Symptoms mild now, I'm barely 24 hours since first symptom. short, no, think significant difference.

I think difference explicable amount friction involved scheduling receiving vaccine, considerably higher usa, well lack trusted unified healthcare provider.

It certainly speak large cultural difference two me, think crux original discussion. Again, matters society, habit role government, think anglophone Canada area us culturally described yankeeland, particularly far apart. Certainly much less far apart Yankeeland deep south. kooky plot Trudeau global elite control poor sclubs like him. Q casualty. Damn hate middle class people too? can’t keep possible, possible anymore now.

If everyone taken measures, would probably near zero China, NZ, Australia, constant monitoring hotspots. Shocker don’t get lol. think vaccine gonna he’d rather die get it?? 80% fully dosed would huge. though.  Well right hospitlisations/deaths still low level compared previous waves UK seen massive rise like would usually seen. way cases may spike hopefully vaccinations keep majority people hospital. Although UK fairly high vaccination rate amongst adults(85% 1st dose) gonna lie: 2nd shot laid couple days. arm soreness took better part week completely go away.

I don’t get sick often, whenever do, get really sick.

I’d rather get vaccine shots million times get COVID-19 once. Oh yeah, 12-18 years well course. receive Pfizer. lots probably vaccinated first dose huge number second doses start reduced Pfizer deliveries start affecting vaccinations. remaining group tiny probably affect vaccinations spread out. running educational campaigns lottos (in province win million dollars getting vaccinated) incentivize people? Honest question, know next nothing Romania.  Hang - understand vaccine stop catching transmitting covid right? reduces symptoms have, catch covid. 

The vaccine stop going hospital. would still end cancer comes catching covid start linking like viruses later road, regardless received vaccine not.

To honest I'm expert, sound totally ignorant vaccine works, yet still trying project onto people's children. Unbelievable. Society going break 600,000 dead either. 9-11. ISIS. That's terrible way thinking world. can't head loops unfortunately. found N95 uses ear loops would've switched work everyone. Floridian pissed daily data eliminated replaced inadequate weekly snapshot.
Pissed. implying facebook feed dude aunt saw facebook credible source? mean, right obviously incredible source. Covid zero possibility. Even every person America vaccinated, 95% efficacy (excellent vaccine standards way), still leaves tens millions people still able spread disease. Add waining immunity number even higher.

Realistically options to

1 vaccinate

2 get covid

3 isolate permanently

There high expectation numbers stay fairly low level turn seasonal like flu. Hmmm. CDC seem behind. possible. Honestly, noticed P1 losing ground last week. Yes, Pfizer completely used 12-18 second doses coming weeks. think 18+ first dose booked July almost 100% sure it’s Moderna. 

It seems like last weeks extra Pfizer deliveries really got us point supply constrains thing past. I’m freaking going 200 cases Michigan yesterday really can't covid free forever. Highly unlikely we'll eradicate covid anytime soon(only 2 diseases eradicated globally). Best vaccinate many people possible covid reach Australia larger numbers hospitlisations surge. Australia actually opens borders eventually accept level covid cases. LA county hotspot? LAX tourism?  matter adults families extended families neighbours vaccinated “People vaccinated protected variant, Levine added, underscoring fact vaccinated individuals ""extremely unlikely get sick"" would ""virtually impossible require hospitalizations."" “ that, little Jimmy, chemtrails made. Interesting...because secondary attack rate basis relative contagiousness estimates first place? comparison alpha delta SAR? It’s going super annoying dumbasses states low vaccination rate causes variant created.

Beyond that, Bharat really dropped ball setting manufacturing, instead focused pushing approval wealthy markets like United States licensing partners.

2. [A plan end role mRNA - including already vaccinated.
3. reduction quotas, lockdowns invariably costly - facilities manage quarantine (because even started building them...).

The easier option, given News Ltd + LNP situation looming election brave, bold strategy:

1. Race virus. jabs arms, AZ, whatever have. ATAGI advice longer relevant, threat level lot higher now.
2. lockdowns, containment.
3. AZ makes weaker symptoms, virus roll million infections provide (hopefully) full immunity quicker Feds vaccinate.
4. ""Open Christmas"".

WA/Vic/SA plan isolate, observe. They'll try less impact mRNA, coming spades October (10mn+ doses/month).

QLD perilous situation - dependent domestic tourism, multiple outbreaks, Federal aid protect businesses - end lockdown tonight, minimal restrictions. happens, happens.

Visibly spitting/screaming post national cabinet, preference. Key references include ""we heaps Pfizer coming September, wait"" similar exasperated comments. ""I want AZ all"". much _not_ pick, cannot self finance fight this, tied happens NSW.

NSW delay long can, every week buys, well, week. lot 1st-shot vaccinations.

Further, buys time observe UK places delta booming. Never mind vax+immunity prior waves, we'll watch hope similar.

They _may_ move this, cannot without Feds financing it. They're currency issuer, one that's responsible welfare broader economy. fund jobkeeper etc, QLD cannot turn back own.

Makes sense guess, since inactivated vaccines use mature technologies.

Also, agree hospitalisation may remain acceptable level. However, unchecked spread virus population widely vaccinated, high selection pressure vaccine resistant strain (since evolutionary advantage vaccine resistant strain high 70%+ vaccinated population).

Up now, selection pressure biased towards infectiousness, people get vaccinated, dont manage stop spread, threat new vaccine resistant variants important.

Let us hope happen, unchecked spread even (hopefully) correlate unchecked hospitalisations, threat anyway.  Oh, understand saying. I've tried. I'm fairly good persuasive arguments, people deep. believe whole thing hoax....their entire identity wrapped this.

The irony many vaccines US high rate people don’t want (compared countries) tragic. Unvaccinated people got mess first place. sure, vaccine exist first outbreak occurred even ways mitigate it. people care simplest things like wearing mask could saved thousands lives. half mind you’d check yourself, refuse waste time lol. sure won’t die, don’t bother checking statistics. sure hell won’t pull lazy ass 😉  sentence mess. I'd *heard* that! Problematic, it? one study. need sure. Ok think he's downvote farmer There's much misinformation vaccines stupid.

I'm personally choosing wear mask summer. know I'll get ""but rules changed?!?!?!"" idiots, rules whether I'm gonna end dead sooner later.

I got shit live for. I'm one making claim, are. Prove assertation.  guess depends live percentage vaccinated. area, expect anything prevent outbreak despite fact low vaccinated rate cases increasing. state legislation banned mask mandates schools end school year. doubt bring masks back, probably anything else protect kids chance vaccinated yet. reason ignorant reality comes spoon fed information. can’t even go nhs website check death toll really is? it’s people lazy taking 2 seconds day mess Bummer them. would lie statistics readily available?

So provide them? Burden proof kid. Brazil replied, went US

This fascinating perspective me. I’m Canada, among first countries order Pfizer. Yet still went USA. get Europe USA blocked vaccine exports came domestic vaccine hesitancy. Eventually they'll die switch stance. That's headed unfortunately. ***Called it!***  stands southerner they're readily available provide us. can't, course, exist. Mutations mostly ""random"" go either way. guess educated means you’re dumbie. energy this?

I've tried to...these people nuts. reasoning crazy wearing mask considered 'overreacting' anyone. literally easiest thing do. People act like asking take shot everytime leave house. Fucking unbelievable frankly. Cognitive dissonance lmao. kill you. would lie statistics readily available? 😂 can’t see need news tell .. large population rare get bad side effects.  understanding said would successful variant virus (for virus, us) since spread kill less hosts. That’s ideal scenario sucker.

Effectively aerosols move chaotically air pass mask, crash large fibers mask get stuck. Obviously tighter weave better, common misconception cloth masks work via sieve like action.

Additionally, recent CDC study shows cloth masks along HEPA filters actually really effective reducing aerosols room. Miami area various rural counties. It’s true UK. news misinformation go statistics. acting like it’s medical emergency it’s declassified high consequence contagious disease since March 2020 Keep us updated! higher chance hospitalised vax , exactly reducing risk of?

This true. Quit spreading misinformation. It’s tough see people actively discrediting vaccines. Saying things like aren’t 100% effective vaccinated people there’s still cases therefore wear mask naive. goal never eradicate Covid it’s virtually impossible 

The goal was/is make Covid like flu hurts most. never thing Covid zero. Could people mask rest life? Sure could - there’s nothing says can’t can’t - lot people don’t want 

For people though, want get back living lives. life many see face masks tied pandemic. It’s one thing cautious - insist things end pandemic don’t work

Your risk may different want accept. accept risk every part lives living day day. It’s laughable people said long ago listen CDC people say don’t disagree guidance

Vaccines road normal. exit pandemic  Mhm... say so... valid exemptions medical. Everyone else arseholes. problem everyone removing masks returning ""normal"" yeah, we're going start getting colds, etc. again. definitely sucks 18+ months without getting sick. Good thing nobody said ignore them, instead work assistance medical professionals, eh? wouldn’t say poor much non industrialized. natural resource wealth cut ties them. amount people get arms ""Calories vs Out"" statement unreal. 

It really simple that, be? 

Are ways weight equation favour? course. body receives energy requires, put storage. body receives less, stores called upon meet shortfall. Anime pfp Prune variants Also children 12. Proof vaccines work Exactly onto something. 

I quote medical article research area. Apparently recognized journal. One quote ""

Look one food source kills species one species adapts mutation allows safely consume food source entire species **will** adapt mutation.

That said respiratory systems mammals similar (hence zoonotic diseases) still differ. virus evolves infect certain species better would likely lose ability infect species. Normally, evolutionary pressure specialize generalize unless different species coexist long time large numbers (farms, wet markets, livestock markets). still luck variables push wonder many new variants can't get foothold patients target cells already infected prevalent variant. can't replicate sufficient numbers, die get passed on.

I come immigrants, bounce United States home country whenever please. country, residents offered sinovac series. 

Hypothetically, could take sino-vac series based current data around 40% effencncy. could go work attest vaccinated, longer routine covid screening.

Is safer outcome vaccinated, thus policy take temperature spo2 everyday, take two covid PCR tests per week? seems like sufficient towards reducing chances spreading virus others. many people spread covid tested negative covid since March last year? concern well know, you’re going build strawman pretend it, helps it’s plausible. Instead you’re coming defensively like someone persecution complex. Yeah, much. Viruses evolved make people expel liquids sneezing, diarrhea, vomiting, etc that's best way infect bunch people. asymptomatic person sneezes allergies, sneezed virus.  Ok unexpected, thank laugh!! 😂 Unknown effectiveness delta variant probably lacklustre compared two dose traditional vaccine (eg. AstraZeneca) two dose mRNA vaccine (Pfizer, Moderna). seems situation different depending are. Munich basically impossible find anything days ago, priority 4. that, nothing doctolib, many family doctors long waiting lists (mine still working people registered April) accept outside patients anyway, vaccination centers people prioritization. days vaccination centers open everyone seems possible find something. fucking building collapsed thing guys care covid, next time mass shooting happens USA guys gonna come say 

„Mass Shooter infects 8 people COVID terrorist attack“ 

That’s fucking ridiculous think whole lot utter bullshit, including “Satan”.  happens end year?  Right?

I super active kids, get extra workout watch show lift, row, bike, run (again super privileged well equipped home gym).

My wife would say I’m wrong bike I’m supposed get beat. whatever, like two things once. know, get kind distain urgent care clinic. However, find attached impatience. Impatience there, impatience pandemic, impatience anyone might get way lives. 

Socially, even South, people used charm legendary politeness, we've taken *huge* step back. Staying home ruined socialization. People forgotten patient kind other. 

I found using motherly growl tends shut they're fit. That, and...""Get out,"" work well.   always spread mutate. goal slow make flu like everyone Gross, unvaccinated people gross sure we're looking death vs clots. lot else worry covid.  They're also dumbasses ignorant medical science experts devote lives make better. see scum. wish would US Many estimates infections among vaccinated people come regular testing groups people part study regular screenings find positives.... yes test less sick less, also routine study based testing get picture many vaccinated people infected. you’re saying data fuels sentiment information? Yeah...we get rid data /s think time technique used Ebola vaccine. I’ve living cave avoiding world lol. family taking since last summer much riskier say least (no masks, bars etc) never caught it. Certainly enough evidence champion drug really find strange immediate united turn soon results announced. 

They say “we don’t recommend it” 0 reasoning. least suggested labels legitimate concerns. one baffling. seem making money suffering go method propagating political power? governing administration governed. faith humanity taking beating late, again.

Edit:The article cookie grab way. Stronger meaning infectious necessarily deadly.  article literally saying anything short FFP3 ineffective; Etsy-made chin diapers folks clinging last year diddly squat. comparing it, joking.

And fact get tinnitus hearing problems Covid-19 itself. worry you? Roughly 1.3M cases year kids?  Travel weekend literally back pre pandemic levels. Country essentially moved   Oh totally agree. think investigated treatment, pointing it’s totally without side effects crowd pointing total alternative vaccinations. actually bought last summer case based early research came out. need tools tool belt really overcome disease. They're going outside. People celebrate sorts ways. middle summer. gets hot fuck place. understand. Variants scary mutate enough vaccine original virus longer effective. think soap killing bacteria, worries humanity breeding superbug due antibacterial soap, argument antibacterial soap killed bacteria resistant, resistant bacteria would thrive. obviously virus, variants infect people vaccinated better reproductive capacity viruses can't. means unvaccinated people ""variant factories"", vaccines selecting variants.

I make clear I'm much pro-vaccine, argument stupid. That’s different, say evangelical family, since God made women subordinate men. wave Bible around prove argument.  Well would higher case, reported 15k alone. doesn’t really matter point. Vaccines available. Death decoupled made correct decision. Others get Covid. That’s pretty much say It’s unfortunate, least west, fortunate enough options. AstraZeneca vaccine saved lot lives save many across world. Whaaaaaaat? Anyone seeing parallels? reminded criminals tearfully plead judges *mean* ruin someone else's life. *think*.

That's key...*to think* consequences, take action. 

I see time clinic patients walk right past ""wear mask"" signs, come mask, act surprised sternly request wear mask give them. first blurt is, ""I think..."" Nope. didn't.  Heart disease leading now, latest numbers back covid. 20k new cases last US dash board. think remembering 20k new cases breaking point Faucci major outbreak back year ago. Oh god, want vaccination already. Everyone else gets go grab one whenever, requirement eighteen!  police dart guns vaccines showing antivax Rally's. oooo...zombie covid? Question: friend flying Arizona significant toddler (they vaccinated, except toddler) Denver. toddler well, I’m vaccinated. question this: would safe allow toddler hang even though they’re high risk flying? know I’ll safe adults be, delta transmissible is, worry toddler mine. Plus, lot times people think flu really cold. Also, mention last pandemic keep bringing 1918 FLU Loki entered chat  article clear difference FFP2 FFP3, using different PPE before. think, without scientific reasoning opinion. decisions reopen based models predictions made people way smarter two us. remember one profs talking law wear seatbelt city back time... one day changed. said immediately dozens dozens people complaining police anyone would listen. #1 complaint — getting injuries seatbelts crashed. said thing none realized nobody complaining seatbelts nobody really wearing dead couldn’t complain.  endured ear loops 40 hours week. need endure go shopping want see movie indoor theater productions. 2 hours easy used 10 hours day. need associate probabilities verbs “can” really understand sentences mean. probabilities different, that’s point vaccines. says 'freshens up' work. **This correct question.** 

Unfortunately, many seem hellbent *forcing* others vaccinated, simply kicks road best... introduces nasty authoritarian precedents worst. Internet Rage Mob care long-term consequences; punishing ""the other"" immediate gratification. Thanks!!! data Lancet exactly looking for. people hit old enough reproduced already. However, parents/grandparents around help things probably won’t good children covidiots there’s still natural selection play directly. quite conclusion drawing there. Could maybe also think reasons people stopped wearing masks longer obligated? trust decision lift ban made well informed people, know rivm plenty people smarter me. Tennessee Valley Authoratah?  order 4000 hospitalizations vaccinated people covid-positive June (and hospitalizations distinctly due covid symptoms). 4000 millions vaccinated since start vaccinations, absence strong herd immunity. vaccine strongly reduce chances hospitalization (which exactly designed - reduction infection rate bonus). Keep mind NEVER vaccine prevents infection 100% time (mumps like 80 something % effectiveness rate iirc).

Furthermore, fixated risk bubble. primary trouble covid individual catching covid, rather community catching it. Covid highly infective, high rate hospitalization. Sure, people die (IF get medical attention), get hospitalized take hospital space use medical supplies. covid ransacks way community (assuming masking/distancing), easily overwhelm hosptials within community. shown early modeling ""flatten curve"" graph. Even masking distancing, states hit 90+% ICU capacity statewide worst. vaccine acts permanent solution (as opposed temporary solution masking/distancing) removes hospitalization risk. 

Source breakthrough hospitalizations: 90% ICU capacity:    No
Evidence vaccines going severely impacted regards terrible outcomes. endemic virus, course continue spread. inevitability. point is, vaccines work. Look UK—-cases going up, it’s okay. They’re opening weeks vaccines decoupled deaths cases. Protozombies   have, also close friend wishes could get vaccine advised doctors. I’m saying it’s common, I’m saying happen. Everyone get vaccinated people can’t.  doesn’t mean much. It’s like immune forever lol. Btw neither vaccinated people
But sure lot longer looking data else would see side effects vaccine far rarer less impactful covid Note Florida posts cases throughout week Fridays, hence higher case count yesterday.  Wtf no... keeps spreading mutating. Ahah yep  fear mongering cnn typically Yup, that's said generally. also elaborated regard Ebola (don't know edit post).

In case Ebola, terrible death phase victim spews virus-laden fluid everywhere. so, infectivity increased, little bit comparison flu. flu, generally killing host, essentially allowed spread unchecked.

It's curve local maximum near killing-with-virus-spreading-side-effects, global maximum firmly biased towards appreciable impact host species. “Expert” Yes, bodily medical autonomy take precedence justification public health. get vaccinated absolutely made to. agree. know do. still small amount people get though 

I actually mild tinnitus guess got experience regularly do!  Sure cant even take vacation deserves dealing covid deniers...  There's still couple dozen cases per year, occasional larger outbreak. Saudi Arabia hundred cases around 2018. title makes sense. virus pathogen. risk entirely depends much prevalent society. fixed ratio risk vaccination virus.

India larger population US there's way fewer deaths. situation India seemed worse US, number people India came /r/covid19positive talking situation actually worse reported. need simply present anymore.

If enough people vaccinated another big wave. inevitable. 

20ish percent vaxxed pathetic. overall risk getting myocarditis vaccine still much, much lower getting regular viral infection, especially COVID. best child protecting COVID lot actions taken US federal state governments pandemic surprised poor decisions, one completely unsupportable.

There’s moral ethical obligation public health provide data hospitalizations COVID. bet statutory requirement well. hope someone sues data - preferably feds. /u/gwarm01 top presidential nominee 2024 That’s completely incorrect. manufacturers recommended “minimum 2-4 year observation period” origin probe politicized, organization acceptable US China. ""experts"" think G-7 better mystery me. anything quoted contradict anything study linked? There's literally contradiction....not sure getting at. Pfizer, Moderna, AZ, Sputnik, Sinopharm Janssen. One roadkill every shot!

No respectable Arkansan pass free dinner possum! Nothing definition requires complete protection. never vaccine gives 100% immunity. sore arm days injected fake vaccines, huh. Good know, thanks info! says opposite. scroll fully vaccinated people concerned Delta variant country destination transmissible variants detected far, twice contagious original virus. Cases hospitalizations increasing many countries around world becoming dominant variant number good news vaccines we’re using world today seem effective preventing severe disease Delta variants currently vaccinated people less likely hospitalized disease, doesn’t mean drop guard: still get ill virus still spread others. That’s it’s important everyone follow #SummerSense tips.

Neither group (CDC WHO) high credibility tbh. Probably reality get sick vaccination, spread virus, agree it’s major driver infection. would love see definitive study someone must done one.

Edit: forgot say thanks posting that. kept getting vague news articles searching.  Thanks, US certainly came aspect  Seriously don’t try bring pragmatism sub, it’s loosing proposition. absolutely baffled people’s response ANYTHING outside “JUST SHOOT UP”.... basic questions met “oh you’re one anti-vax idiots”. looked guy's profile. lot posts trolling people Covid. Ah Yes. I’d love one “we told so, enough yet?” him. Even child parents made sure knew done something truly foolish. “Yes, it’s hot. told you.” I’m Minnesota love it! live Kansas City, much…

Why Missouri suck vaccinations? bad idea since state drowning plague rats. We're going reading lot stories like coming months. Good job, dummies. That’s end saying, lead says “Will Delta variant kill children regardless vaccination status? Tune tonight answers.”  Thank you. 

Now next needlessly alarming headline. part punishment work COVID ward, serve well Thanks letting know, I’ll remove comment. “It’S FdA aPpRovEd.”

Because FDA’s approval would definitely sway them. Uh-huh. wonder causes that. Anyone clue? Keep mind bot incorrect, article 2 July 2021, recent. live Clay county Missouri, north side Kansas City. vax rate much higher Missouri, still significantly lagging full states like Vermont. It’s embarrassing. 

If look vax map I-70 corridor many vaxxed, north south they’re scared needles. something could point would tell us LA county better delta hot spots …

Hmmmm.  wish president would articulate uncertain terms stubborn states. Kids catch take home families extended families neighbors. Hinging deal continued compliance psychiatric medication makes sense original offense occurred result untreated mental illness. (Even though I’d argue potential abuse I’m comfortable with) 

Hinging deal agreeing methadone treatment makes sense drug offenses.

Hinging deal Covid-19 vaccine arbitrary. “incentive” vaccinated May 26th—$20 scratch-off lottery ticket, gift certificate redeemable hunting fishing license. I’m guessing governor received complaints since recently stated Arkansas cannot legally offer lottery exchange getting vaccinated. Since scratch-off ticket lottery, it’s don’t want spend money. South ~~Carolina~~ greater risk Yep. remember immense relief felt got second dose realized days away pandemic largely me.

It’s feeling I’ll never forget completely controlled china UK also lot vaccines arms already. Vaccinated people still catch delta, viral load much smaller don’t pass much. hope least used sterile new needles You’re spot on. That’s precisely rare condition it’s referring to. phrasing “not harmful initially thought” doesn’t inspire confidence. Looking stats it’s hardly harmful all. 600,000 people it. They're dead. Millions mourn them. Millions likely long term health consequences virus. 

Grow up. Israel lift mask mandate again? Here's many more. Seems infer resistance spreading getting it. try hard look sketchy say, ""hey... want shrooms?""

Then proceed hand portobellos trenchcoat would good national moral mental health people saying that, inability bring Australians home (and fact still can't halfway 2021) huge failing federal government, direct result fucking quarantine arrangements, vaccine procurement

halfway 2021 we're wondering even transmissible virus managed escape iron dome local ibis motel. joke. one richest countries earth btw Suffer? Fucking SUFFER?

We've lost fucking plot here. Wearing mask suffering. think you’re talking enabling vs trying disable it. I’m saying hey it’s cool scared worries.... I’m saying hey people scared that’s probably aren’t getting vaccinated. don’t necessarily mean scared literal sense, they’re afraid insecure don’t understand. 

I’m also generalizing little bit too, sorry that. Yup, Governor blamed last summer spike press reporting enough. Maybe think don’t much you’ll keep precautions 2 weeks past second shot. would suck get sick shots. Well said, nevertheless, looks like history repeating itself. Chicago opened early surge Spanish Flu nearly wiped huge portion population? 

Florida already seeing localized pockets infection. Duval, Henry, Washington Counties looking grim. political Canada know share rural people get it. Rural. People stubborn. agree. Although certain areas so/so vaccination rates AND/OR natural immunity (i'm advocating route FYI - looking N/S Dakota) may enough immunity prevent spike. Yeah miracle injection almost entirely prevents severe illness something see sci fi novel😁 uk curve bad check Spain curve. like line going straight required attend public school... school requirements legally circumvented, note, adult dictating children can't get vaccines is, opinion, fucked court compelling people get them.

Im saying get vaccines, I'm saying hold individuals accountable transmitting pathogens without intent, shouldn't.

As far antivaxxers go, c'est la vie. illegal fucking idiot, think that's road wanna go down. We'd end almost government, cops, entire state California would end giant prison colony we'd rename australifornia something... (I'm joking... Jeffersonians exempt, know are). Thank posting number. 40%. Yes, bad. wait another *week*. seen curve UK showing quickly numbers rose, took barely month Delta took root hit 90% versions COVID had. Insane. It'll dominant soon. 

By keeping numbers quiet, it'll make worse. walked gas station/convenience store Pasco (I masked despite vaccinated) *not one person* store masked except me. 

So people taking CDC's ""mask vaccinated"" cue wear masks all. Who's going ask them? bother? tempted ask, see responses....but frankly wanted get 5 minutes. knows Delta's exposure time is? want sore throat runny nose. cold *anything* 2 years. refuse get sick now. Scary, though, looking faces unvaccinated. could walking dead. sure mean old man, current emperor Naruhito who's 60s. don’t pull punches… propaganda machine running full speed He’ll fine That's exactly did. want immunity full two weeks stage three starts Ontario. taking chances delta I'd rather take Moderna hold another Pfizer playing delusions.

Waves infection respiratory virus self-limiting well herd immunity reached. true Spanish Flu well. second wave devastating infected tens millions people peaked within month fell cases low right mid-winter. Spring 1919 third wave nevertheless took place, less deadly second still far deadlier first wave. 

Cases India declined now, likely rise coming months unless get far people vaccinated first. shall see that. 
And first world countries act wrong well. mistaken. 
For long Rt 1,0 hospitalization levels would rise geometrically - eventually would mean triage. reach herd immunity may unmask. Anti-vaxxers assuring reach herd immunity.

Sorry, deleted earlier comment said much thing. removed sentence expressing pointed opinion. anyone first hand experience revaccination? I'm aware CDC recommends 28 window last dose non-FDA, non-WHO approved vaccine. One parents fully vaccinated Sputnik I'm starting think looking J&amp;J them, I'm afraid probably studied. went ready take whatever gave matched first pfizer dose, sounds like they're saving 12 17s (I'm Ottawa) terrifying  Can't argue stupid people.

 Independently r0 is, we’re seeing UK broken chain cases hospitalizations/deaths. 
 
The chain broken. Triage achieved even lower hospitalization rate long Rt 1,0.  Well lot people returning citizens caught Australia pandemic hit 18 months ago Yeah offered shot moderna second although given pfizer first, took shit ASAP People's brains breaking last xxxx years Yes. Notable example: Eduardo Rodriguez Red Sox sidelined last season getting covid developing myocarditis. got brain that’s how. great start linking autoimmunity cancer road, like many viruses. kids gonna ask couldn’t vaccinated 'long-term?' area low vaccination rate? informing decision? Early thirties, overweight. Hopefully treatments improved gets better. CFR (0.3%) hospitalization rate (5%?) low vulnerable vaccinated. young people need hospital stays much shorter times. 

THIS. Followup, hospitalizations contunued shoot today well. 4 times rate month ago.  people commenting site right-wingers outlying rural counties. town papers either exist one commenting, spam St. Louis news comments day validate other. 2k day, makes worst state good margin. theyve worst state month, since spring Michigan surge. 

It's amazing stopped reporting daily numbers trick people thinking state well - worked! New info:

The seven-day case average Florida increased 1,578 really highest bar though I'd like know more. May subscribe newsletter? rate deaths traditionally followed cases broken

CFR lower, broken link. old people 90% uptake CFR could low enough let young catch - could UK 0.3% CFR US still 1-2% (more test avoidance US also contribute). unclear would rather waiting two weeks give younger people first weeks behind UK vaccinations. believe it’s 70 percent adults 20 states.

Well, stats say youre wrong doesnt even out, since blood donors antibodies general public. 

Why earth would even lol. 
Do math: even half cases unreported (say 20% covid) still high enough antibody levels, single blood donor got covid, modest 1/3 higher likelyhood vaccinating would make difference. Well started back April already, middle first wave, quite lot donors already. started 2.7%. Since tested thousands donors monthly results.

Alright, that's similar Netherlands. people received least one dose Netherlands 60%, Poland 45%. That's quite difference. estimate vaccination readiness is? Something around 60% maybe?

Throughout pandemic, even working peak ICU physician wife worked every single day home gym.

Now know everyone home gym like ours, there’s privilege everyone access place push ups, sit ups, walk.

Not stimulating work out, 30 minutes activity day huge (as minimally processed diet). many places offering antibody tests donate blood. Sometimes tests even recognized vaccination passport. That's masks still important long case numbers still fairly high. Everyone acting like anyone wearing mask over-reacting, there's still real chance infection groups. creating strawman fallacy since vast vast vast majority unvaccinated people among tiny number people ""can't get vaccine"" Also, countries low degree vaccination (pretty much entire third world) mass variant manufacturing sites. can't go leave unless vaccinated.  mandatory good citizens.   understand article saying people can't get vaccine ever reasons.

Demonising people creating fear divining people work. Pfizer Moderna? Kind sad Heart Disease, Diabetes Strokes often brought weight issues, main deaths Americans. chances stroke like 5-10x higher general population overweight, diabetes II heart condition. brought weight lack exercise. Smoking alligator sounds like scaley high ""Double triple"" current case counts would basically put Missouri back late December 2020 early January 2021. Delta variant joke ... get vaccinated! Buy scientists time work boosters! economy mostly based mining ponzi scheme real estate market overvalued max. International travel required either those.  even website China bid houses like Ebay auction. 

So lack travel incoming tourists probably harming tourist airline industries much else. 

We recent small number Delta variant cases. Instead spending money properly ramp vaccination program, PM announced incoming flights restricted. currently last developed nations % vaccinated. Based username, I'm guessing Philippines? Really hope vaccine supply gets ramped quickly region. 

We recently accelerated Singapore seem 5% dropoff rate first second doses far. sure that's simply delayed avoided second doses though. run space... Percentage patients need oxygen constant monitoring start lose consciousness pass away. certain point medical teams can't keep lose people would survived treatment. mean mrna-mrna two different vaccines (pfizer + moderna) ? vaccine? CDC politicalized since late 1970s director became presidential appointee (previously SES level senior civil servant like Dr Fauci is). got half sick day per vaccine. didn’t covid vaccine needed full day first one due waiting afterwards location vaccine site/appointment times available. second shot needed 2 days getting vaccine ready work. Brazil keep seeing seemingly endless surges? sounds like wishful thinking Covid supporters. I've read nothing suggest states going change zero Covid strategy, states responsible (and taking action over) public health. hospitals country require staff vaccine? Oh, way, elected officials run Galveston County, decided divert important Covid Relief money political publicity stunt.

- That’s true all. Vaccines prevent 90% infections original strain least Covid. That’s infections went way - vaccines. Hospitalizations also went thanks largely vaccines

These vaccines work. Sure, people may abnormal reaction vast, vast majority won’t don’t still absolutely mind boggled year half global pandemic, people still don’t know properly wear masks (over mouth nose).

I recently saw article virus levels spiking Russia photo maybe eight nine people walking public, masks chins. /s???? comment leads ask: happens Australia’s vaccination hits high levels cases creep ? foreseeable future… going lockdown isolate forever? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

The risk serious myocarditis much higher get virus, vaccine still much safer.  would potentially years talking about. Us, India, Japan, countries Europe... would’ve talking years months. Also, what’s low? People differing definitions low cases. 

About booster shots, talking booster shots fall. talked months. Whether it’s good strategy idk - know goal shots come yearly tackle new strains virus also develop treatments like flu

Vaccines touted road normal that’s be. think that’s virtually impossible go back restrictions general - there’s much overall public sentiment country wear mine public indoors, definitely school (I teach 8th summer school) Floriduh. They're giving Covid vaccines schools US. works like describe.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   I'm even sure shots got Army. literally walked hallway underwear getting pneumatic shots arms couple butt end. basic deployment.  Would fairly easy keep masking keep restrictions cases low could deal isolated areas.

instead strategy fully open soon possible. It’s also going near impossible go back restrictions, constant half assed approaches biting us every time still haven’t learned.

“Just take another variant booster shot” it’s little month since got vaccinated strategy. It’s time… least go low hanging fruit. fed total control military wondering heck don’t make fully mandatory.

I really hope private employers quickly follow suite. think vaccines approved kids 12 September ? July even get time school? Ok. adults. Currently almost 75% adults one dose vaccine. Let's say around measurement around 70% adults antibodies vaccinations. assume around 20% COVID-19 quite bit overlap two groups. Add selection bias quickly get 77%. never going time get rid virus. That’s goal. goal make like flu vaccines boosters do

The goal world ending every single time new variant. one freaks much time flu one time extremely deadly  Sounds like Australia run old wankers care business interests. Specifically business interests donate them. Don’t want obvious wearing mask won’t help live home family. people going wear mask home therefore virus still spreads

As vaccinated people, still get sick chances severe disease much lower - especially say unvaccinated person Shenanigans give up! 17%. 10% indeed bollocks. Time move on. ones saying that. People saying risk level much smaller thanks vaccines. Vaccines road normal Well, people want get seriously ill Covid will. said yourself, people care. 

I think beyond eradicating virus, vaccines provide level immunity like flu, suggest? Lockdowns forever?

I complain lockdowns get years that's much even strategy must change. Let people want vaccines catch Covid, good them. university refused allowed unvaccinated students sit exams result even brain dead thinks vaccination kill 2 years got first dose. Maybe could ask volunteers administering schools. know friend nurse volunteered spend couple days working local clinic administered vaccine community back April running large clinics. Many areas could probably find doctors nurses willing volunteer, even non-medical people could volunteer help records paperwork aspect schools. would honestly say what’s risk getting vaccine? Millions gotten vaccines fine. Especially Pfizer Moderna - even don’t think high risk, doesn’t hurt take maybe ten minutes day get vaccinated first dose bit sleepy minor aches 48 hours. 
2nd dose, bed 48 hours. Felt like flu (aches/pains).

But whole hell lot better catching COVID, again. Bribery 'Show Me' reported 1,000 additional COVID-19 cases Wednesday Thursday, first time since Feb. 12 consecutive days 1,000 cases. last date 3,000 cases Jan. 15. Yeah, definitely not. However, it’s probably least portion them. entirely. idea make Covid like flu everyone - mostly older adults underlying conditions. strategy everyone mask up

Although agree say everyone get booster shot work, it’s going to. think point accept higher level risk much one wants to. level governors clue tbh that’s pandemics hard manage - one agree do

It’s anyone wants people die get sick - it’s people know can’t continue forever even though Covid always around  good road start down. Vaccines offer protection, complete protection. sense vaccines create fitness filter serves evolutionary pressure escape immunity. vaccinated people exposed variants likely variant bypasses immunity emerge. Oh dang I’m sorry hear that. Hope things work ok. Sure, often see people make sound like Covid vaccine issue a: there's bunch different Covid vaccines b: judging data different vaccines. Seriously get mad firefighters something like that?? people literally go burning buildings save lives. important anyone get vaccinated people saving lives. course gotten vaccinated early. would town whole fire department came COVID fire emergency requiring help?  Eww, thank info. TIL! Maybe threaten knife something ? Pretty sure already known. point. Stuff happens people able discuss without accused discouraging vaccines. way ""force"" get it. Came this. Smallpox issue spreading like wildfire whilst retaining massive lethality many, many years. Besides, covid kill untill primary infectious period ends, deadly really matter transmission. reaction vaccines

Yeah well sister intense 3 week reaction whopping cough vaccine. Stuff happens. (cancels citizenship application) that's obviously valid, think case 15 million allergies. military whatever hell wants. property. 100% Covid. shot trigger normal even intense immune response. Shortness breath immune response, virus symptom.

Please edit original reply clarification. essentially.spreading misinformation vaccine. worst strategy. tough time getting people take 1 vaccine. many people get next one? next? diminishing returns someone Covid whose shots, could understand someone hesitant get second shot. 

Covid breeze me. runny nose couple hours, overall asymptomatic. 

My first shot Moderna really kicked ass, chills, body aches, head ache, 36 hours. Symptoms started roughly 12 hours j got shot. 

My second shot wasn’t nearly bad. symptoms miniature scale. 

My point people like Covid wasn’t serious all, decided get shot way worse Covid itself, may thinking get second shot first shot made way sick getting Covid actually did. shot long acting penicillin consistency peanut butter Yeah, reading actual reported side effects little info packet get vaccine Germany pretty enlightning. update frequently even stuff like feeling tired, assume inflated bit, 60%. Muscle aches like 30%. think Moderna tad bit higher still. KN95 N95 respirators (masks) properly worn shown highly effective preventing spread virus. One study showed even stronger filter - N99 FFP3 offer appears complete protection. proven effective environments workers must work virus known air ICUs. work principle electrostatic precipitation, simple screening like cloth mask, finer virus particles effective masks are. means matter much effective virus gets hanging air, able defeat masks. happens double vaccinated people Missouri need medical help different reason there's capacity? really feel like taken account point prioritising patients, tough call make. I'd hate responsible admissions make decisions. worry UK due surging cases, parents elderly needed hospital care last years. They're double dosed need care something else hospitals full... slight headache first shot, injection site hurt days. second shot, migraine, dizzy, leave couch, felt awful. migraine eleven days. absolutely terrible. wish reports honest side effects. Almost everyone know got sick second shot, typically day. people older, seem get affected. mom, step-dad, father affected.  always assume basically one read article, especially Reddit (the goes long comments way), title always informative enough clear. However, posted translation comments. Springfield, Missouri, covid patients ICU unvaccinated. Wait yet finished third wave fifth wave? believe thousands scientists doctors, dont know could say sway mentality. Sounds like probably covid, vaccines cause shortness breath NYC already done schools underserved communities.

That said, feel since they've already gotten Pfizer going CVS/Walgreens, primary care offices. Pfizer's deep freeze requirements relaxed research. 10% official case number 1.69M (population 17.3M).

17.75k deaths 0.6% death rate would point 2.96M cases (17%). Covid infections missed, covid deaths, unlikely.

Show single source ""many would argue 20% low"". number would need around 30%-40% make ""balancing out"" theories even remotely possible mathematically. “Peanut butter shot”? physical activity better sitting around. feel overwhelmed exercise regimen, something like walking gardening working minutes day longer undeniable benefits: better mood, energy, better heart health. 

Exercise alone enough lose weight (and, actually, *required* lose weight makes bit easier). What's required simply burning calories one consumes.

But thats pretty much it. think hospitals earlier announcing requirement, perhaps longer timeframe (e.g., September 1). Methodist certainly first saying ""you fired"" *actually firing people*. definitely experienced lymph node swelling injection side first Moderna shot. overall arm soreness general shitty feeling pretty remarkable 2nd shot much easier deal with. wonder there’s small portion actually got second though. son got shots went second said something weird system info put again. He’s fully vaxxed keep getting texts confirmation number urging get second shot.  “third world” also coined countries didn’t ally NATO Soviet’s like 50 years ago. There’s huge difference countries people love throw “third world”. Yeah, there’s chance actual covid vacation, I’ll never know. imagine last right lose job and/or medical insurance. well that's case portugal, so. dunno bring don’t feel unsafe either tbh. I’ve fully vaccinated since April, everyone know either fully vaxxed adamantly opposed getting it’s loss IMO. Second dose 16th July NL (32 yo, somehow lucked next day appointment first jab) maybe would usually show within days vaccinated. worth making phone call doctor offices open weekend. agree disagree then? We’re going get anywhere, won’t change mind won’t change yours. 

My reason absolutely grounded, personal morals. sure isn’t reason, that’s may well quit going back forth. wife I, well parents, COVID January year. 2 kids, 5 4, also sick, never got tested. Now, they’re sick again, fevers, sore throats, cough. We’re Missouri, Delta cases around. Could COVID again, almost certainly January? ??? dog doesn’t get corona   Congratulations! 🥳 got first shot yesterday can't wait second dose 🥳 virus needs healthy people provide links vulnerable populations like organ transplant recipients immune suppressants can't build immunity even get vaccine. vaccine protect yourself, break links virus easily encounter healthy people keep spreading asymptomatically reaches another vulnerable person adds another death list. Also, time virus replicates chance mutation. healthy, unvaccinated people are, incubators exist mutate potentially stronger iterations. kids basically?? long presymptomatic phase, virus could mutate deadly, selective pressure applied it. reason viruses typically get deadly kill host chance spread it. case cov2, infected people would spread place finally showing symptoms dying. mean I’ve vaccinated three months, lump discovered three days ago. I’ll definitely ask though see dr month. believe so. Please someone correct I'm wrong extremely limited understanding viruses, mutations generally contagious less deadly.  Doubtful seems based surveys - article makes reference reasons given missing second shot. not? 

Reg. Wearing masks, already wear 10 different pieces clothing whenever go out. extra mask much ask. 

Reg. Social distancing, opinion, less crowded public spaces much better humans packed like sardines.  Many people (at least US) opting out. excuses range from: “Covid big fat conspiracy” “I’m young healthy, don’t need it” “the vaccine dangerous”. simply refuse step back understand science, impact decision society. It’s truly one low points history, squander medical miracle ignorance selfishness. raise insurance rates? require proof vaccination travel? We’ve tried incentives … minimal impact. choices have? apple pie actually English? idea.  don’t know details reaction recommended second. also already Covid I’m hoping he’ll okay. variant likely little closer defeating vaccines entirely, cycle repeat variant spreads.

I don’t think so. vaccine works producing entire protein spike. It’s like putting wanted sign Bears. Bears breed create new Bears new Bears still Bears they’re easily identifiable Bears. vaccine works way. entire protein spike used put wanted poster. means virus covid protein spike easily identifiable covid immune system body attacks it. work variants virus mutates beyond human infectious covid point won’t problem humans spike can’t latch onto human cells. bet RNA vaccine continues work variants foreseeable future. They're violating nap breathing Absolutely. Even clinic providers rarely test patients cold/flu symptoms covid they’ve vaccinated. divisive, drunk driving assholes people make choices 🙄 think people worried new variant pop new guidance issued. 

Personally I’m glad rid mask looks like vaccine working.   know big anti mask vaccine guy MO. He's sitting duck. sad, do? listen anything he's certain knows everything. may survive this. 400/10,000,000 fewer per capita 50/600,000 thought told “vaccine shop”

I’m freakin confused man lol I’m listening scientists keep getting worried lol Ofc, say otherwise 🙄 wearing hazmat suits.  cannot read article link aware Los Angeles Times, like Washington Post New York Times, provides coronavirus news free charge. sign newsletter access stories subject.  Sorry dude ""I take medicine unless to"" reason. ""I take medicine unless *because* I'm immunocompromised"", ""I take medicine unless *because* I'm naturally immune everything"", reasons. reason grounded anything, life ""moral"" leads hazardous conditions everyone around you. really hope much public around people risk spreading anything them.  got vaccine soon available, I'm USA. kind irritating say OK. assure got first shot soon eligible, getting second shot now, soon possible. sound like kind ass. 

Restaurants reopened dine here, early, live province Canada controversially opened everything Jul 1. 

Even lockdowns mild could walk right major places completely boarded signs taken now. give crap idea mean. never left house article specially regards receive flu shot cardiovascular disease, general population.  Sure bad society seen value robust safety net citizens 17% mortality numbers (assuming standard 0.6% mortality). conspiracy theorists promoting fears vaccine make people infertile kill years line. making vaccines dangerous ways instantly observable, keep distrust going lot longer claiming vaccines cause immediate effects. trust people vaccinated truly healthy. Lots anecdotal evidence UK people recovered covid catch delta. anecdotal evidence recovered people also double-vaccinated also catch delta.

That said: likely cases much less severe would otherwise been. Think bad cold instead hospitalization.    suspect part issue relatively low uptake rates US compared rates Canada, combined fact supply, still behind US full vaccination rates. We’re catching I’m pretty sure do, we’ll see movement.

Also possible requiring proof full vaccination sticking point since I’m sure US states/Canadian provinces still figuring integrate data secure federal system… Yeah lower used 17 20 too. Still quite impossible then. Everybody know extreme example post kind thing writer worried about, make al individual action. IMHO, piece telling society move on, warning response portion population isn’t matter individual action- medical “system” (such US) prepared deal COVID long haulers, employers don’t policies people highlighted article vaccinated friends family pushy people vaccinated, advised doctors act aren’t vaccinated. 

Go live vaccinated life, see friends family help society recover, little understanding people whose way back “normal” tedious murky. According article, flu shot actually lowers risk developing blood  countries, infection + 1 dose Pfizer considered fully vaccinated (for control purposes) see coming from. got take sick time work. thought would've got stimulus check taking now. that's case, I'll take sick time. I'll take whatever get. took selfish reasons also protects others consider type anti-hero. Neither good bad. stubborn? That's get vaccine? far vaccines pretty effective variants, COVID curtailed, fewer fewer variants (due less total infections).

This easy category restaurants, etc etc

What restaurants still closed due covid? least northeast US every restaurant still business fully open months I'm getting Pfizer shot

Kudos, fact waited long makes wonder I'm even arguing with...  Yes. Viruses kill host good (from virus perspective). general trend contagious less deadly rule thumb. 

Of course takes one exception Source? would love links this, interested read this. Thank provide. extremely important statistic though, especially since Astrazenica given many places medical care harder get. would honestly wait get different vaccine risk death getting disease lower vaccine. would interested see stats every day vaccines things like Flu, travel see compares I’m sure adenovirus vaccines stick arms without issue carry risk. cases like covid see many asymptomatic carriers

It's much worse that:

Symptomatic carriers become infectious onset symptoms! bulk transmission happens way someone ends hospital. So, thing becomes 10x deadly, directly affect transmission rates Isn’t medical consensus variant different enough evade vaccine immunity would probably also enough change fundamentally change COVID (to less severe)? Well questions are, vaccinated people still getting Covid (yes get PR less severe, less need hospitalizations, etc.,) well still ""traveling"" around something transmission stuff potential variants. pain, didn’t see paragraph article posted - source paragraph? like flu, probably.

But make mistake; influenza fatal. kills 646,000 people annually, that’s *with* highly available vaccine updated every year. problem manufacturing capacity. Like sure, it’s possible update vaccine pretty quickly, keeping manufacturing capacity quickly push 7 billion doses available case need would massively expensive obvious year ago?

China upgraded full PPE early hospital staff infections managed zero additional staff infections whole Wuhan lockdown period measures implemented. Yeah, sounds awesome, someone also severe anxiety.. Glad able go it. I'm deleting original comment, downvote one instead now. 
Take care. article:

""That rare clotting, known Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS), case fatality rate 17% 20%, said."" read people getting two ""first shots"" different locations convenient traveling school something first. wonder many people actually two shots counted twice single shot. Ireland made AZ available 18-34 year olds want wait mRNA vaccine get age group. imagine related that. me, unvaccinated person: well f\*ck  must eliminate variants protect sacred timeline risk dying clots? thought low.  Masks issue with. No, talking that. talking restrictions places vaccines. Closed restaurants, etc etc. see plenty popular places shuttered good am. year, ok necessary sacrifice. one year businesses going bankrupt? No. Strategy must change, enough enough vaccines here.

Also, I'm getting Pfizer shot, potentially consider wearing mask indoors, parties house, otherwise living normal. Masks big deal, I'm going freak people wearing places high vaccination rates like am. 

The places access, well, better work that. bad headline, could definitely worded better. scientific illiterate die harmed wealthy countries quickly iterate variants?

Sounds fine me.  clearly expert going mad, share credentials are? planning emergency use authorization submission older age group [ages 5-11] September October year, younger group follow soon thereafter.

I doubt could get submit October still, maybe thanksgiving indeed think pandemic controlled leans cautious imho.  true cultures...

For instance Mexican friends family mom lead charge, dad follows. says like among many Mexican families.  Exactly world nuanced, can't take something face value, especially situation / topic many nuances.  Serious question guys , alternatives popping serious studies backing ivermectin, UK trails Mexico trials , pushed also? combination vaccines potential drugs like ivermectin , wouldn’t create powerhouse combat scenario virus ? heard ivermectin studies history behind terms trials side effects ? 

Genuine question. he's quarantining home getting vaccinated he's not, going store. that, works public, goes restaurants, pretty much anything could come contact people, he's risk spreading since he's unvaccinated. Selfish logical

Chances going called hate politicized become. I’ve telling people variants ever since vaccines available. would bet money report gets public, anti-vaxxers claim “new” “excuse” “force” vaccine them. Something like “I hope Covid wipes half population drags antivaxxers screaming rest us.”  would test sure symptoms. true context viruses. advantageous virus kill debilitate host soon infectious period-- instance, starkly lethal 1918 flu pandemic evolved another seasonal flu strain, spread easier host dead. However, covid confounding factors might provide evolutionary pressure become less lethal: infectious 2 days prior symptom onset, allowing spread time, asymptomatic / variable symptom spread. delta variant infectious associated higher rate hospitalization. Could fluke. We'll see usually wear FFP2 FFP3 mask 7 8 hours day job. Used 8 months still can't understand fuck hard wearing people. Seriously guys piece clothing fucking Facehugger Alien saga.  moral obligation reduce spread somehow participate society. means wearing mask situations transmission likely (ex. know Vax status others), required. morally inconsistent let others make decision wear mask take medicine. decision take medicine reason take vaccine arbitrary illogical moral value. moral value principles behind gets consistent results applied variety circumstances - arbitrary rule made (and likely cause self harm good either). seem victim false health information benefit education analytical thinking yet. late seek remedy that. Biontech CEO said exact opposite. said currently expect need new, modified vaccine. really something else begrudging firefighters getting shot early. Wow. That's said ""stay internet"", stay Marvel online communities. creep anywhere. Remember r/4chan Endgame spoilers description? Yeah stay deal decisions hang r/tropicalweather hurricane season people well clearly cheering for, least thrilled by, destruction loss life. People weird.  Ok partially true misleading way. Yes, vaccines put evolutionary pressure viruses mutant successful high barrier would mutate significantly suppressed immune system point longer transmissable. would likely also fundamentally change virus infecting people vaccine targets protein COVID uses penetrate cells. MUCH likely see variants coming unvaccinated people virus freely mutate become transmissable again. always always always better people vaccinated. Think normal flu, put vaccine every year even though mutates quickly, still 1000x better people vaccinated controls severity, spread also reduces random chance virus mutant infecting others.
Example: study hepatitis B mutant managed evolve evade vaccine, infections rare conclusion 'it warrant changes vaccines programs' keeping eye rare mutants.  You’re unreasonable. wouldn’t hanging anti-vax/mask people unvaccinated kids. don’t willingly hang idiots even non-pandemic times, either. 🧑‍🚀🔫🧑‍🚀

Always been. Yep, didn’t covid either. Sounds like experience almost same. Oh yea anything possible. likelihood becoming real bad low based historical precedence. 

Also even significant mutation prior infection vaccinated likely least level protection (e.g. avoid severe cases) 

During H1N1 kids dying high rates everyone surprised elderly severely impacted. turned partial protection virus like 50s variants ""regular"" adenovirus vaccines part. vaccines usually get subunit, inactivated live vaccines, attenuated, traditional vaccines. Virus vector vaccines approved anything widespread past prior covid. #science Ah yes. variants come places treated covid well populations 50% vaccination rate variants developed. smoke, buddy? Source?

Here's me, let know want more. symptoms covid. brief headache 20min. vaccine worse. ever colonoscopy, make sure mark end insert scope, I'm sure they'll confused. HSE said risk rare blood clotting Astrazeneca Janssen, known adenoviral vector vaccines, one per 100,000 aged 50, double that, two per 100,000 aged younger 50.

Well, would lower people higher age? must co-factor, like birth-control, initially suggested. still give good answers that. Talking fucking covid subreddit scummy thing though World Health Organisation.  Weird saying months getting downvoted oblivion. promoting mask wearing virus fully contained hey working honor system. joke. or, acknowledge personal choice put risk doubt three day lockdown severe mental health impact.  bullshit.  probably spend 99% outside time work.  unvaccinated kids home?
Correct-Mongoose, every right laser focused rage plague rat.  ""The science"" filtered US news pharmaceutical bureaucrats. 

Any virologist anyone basic introductory college level biology courses tell important thing reducing vaccine resistant strains ensure vaccinated regularly exposed virus. unvaccinated much less likely source vaccine resistant strain.

The US seems feel need reward recieve vaccine wear masks really masks stay foreseeable future indoor public locations, especially among vaccinated. children get shot? trend. guarantee. Mutation random.

Suitability strain survive less prevalent less contagiousness. two attributes coexist though tend remain separate exclusive. dice rolled random mutation mutations occur - virus attempts infect another cell (be originally infected individual another) succeeds survives whether contagious original strain not.

The people available immunity whatsoever possibility wider range mutations (which essentially biological equivalent ""what this?""). virus larger playground reproduction.

Despite trend contagious less deadly (due selective pressure) mix attributes created mutation mutations.

It biological equivalent several dice rolls new copy created infection virus. stay internet? That's Endgame came out. Nothing stop us talking  second shot automatically scheduled based chosen date first shot. example, Pfizer exactly five weeks first dose. important comment! Hope numbers continue despite Delta variant, really think it’s time start adding stat including who’ve long-term/seriously disabled virus.

Now, heart disease leading again, looks like Americans dying inhaling cheeseburgers, chair watching screen instead real life … *yay, us*( /s)  kind is, actually.

See let’s look giraffes example.
Long ago giraffes may much shorter necks. may able access much food couldn’t reach high tree tops. along came offspring born slightly longer necks. easier time getting food source able produce babies food = reproductive activity.
Over time, number giraffe families longer necks reproduced faster giraffe families shorter necks, time long necked families efficient gathering food themselves. time, shorter necked giraffes could keep reproduction out-bred.

The lack food source acted selective constraint guide evolutionary path giraffe.

Similarly, virus, instead food reproduce, need host.
If many potential hosts vaccinated, many viruses might able use them. However, offspring may mutations allow still infect vaccinated hosts.

In time, mutated viruses get access hosts able reproduce, causing species whole adapt mutation allows infect vaccinated hosts.

This sort process allows bacteria develop anti-biotic resistant properties. it’s encouraged use antibiotics needed, use them, use ensure trace bacteria left alive don’t go spread acquired antibiotic resistance. Bro, cool... delete comment... Major spoilers like bummer like wait whole show come watch once. Vaccinations happened. correlation people make choice personalities people I'd rather around high that, anyway, pretty much perfect outcome. world total uproar people crying dogs cats do/not year etc. - obviously, zoonotic infection possible (since, know, happened), animal-to-human (or human-to-animal) transmission apparently low really significant problem factor. 


While \*are\* spending seconds dimes problem, that. spending even percent corona budget ""what animals?"". That's true. Personally think people take stand vaccines myopic pussies, possibly bright. latter category stops judging harshly. they're born certain capacity reason struggle understand utility society getting vaccinated, judge. It'd like judging cat born two legs slower siblings. can't control limitations. yikes dude. going go enlightened centrism now? f empty-headed, joe rogan-esque political ""philosophy"" There's actually real proof jumped animal human. There's also proof theory. wanted make clear alternative bat theory still possible, able actually find evidence this. exactly conclusion committee went Wuhan. considered lab escape unlikely, still possible. I'm saying jump animal, there's proof point. easy YOU

some us wear masks 10+ hours straight work

taking shot everytime leave house would much easier wearing mask hot kitchen 10+ hours straight day actually major spoiler. Mark  Except much immunity NIH wrong...

Herd Immunity. occur vaccines. mutated strain propagate non mutant strain (and may well get where) without selective pressure vaccine resistance. fun masking social distancing! mostly got moderna. never covid sore arm first shot, second one solid fever within 5 hours couldn’t eat much. took 2 days shot felt mostly good little tired. I’m youngish though, nurse warned “if you’re young healthy it’s going make feel sick- least know worked!” 

If need booster future I’m planning Friday afternoon. 1. don’t know true length immunity. hoping around 8 months doesn’t stop able spread others

3. aren’t dealing one strain Covid anymore. delta fucking around. Thank amazing internet person! Replication appears somewhat diminished within vaccinated individuals exposure. virus you’re vaccinated short opportunity replicate immune system mounts full defense. 

Anyway say breakthrough cases covid-19 variants vaccinated people definitely excuse get vaccinated. vast extreme majority new variants come pool unvaccinated people virus replicate unchecked. Maybe long term, completely chance. people get vaccinated, likely evolutionary pressure favor infectious less severe virus that's maximum way virus spread. However, biology works sloppy way mutation completely based chance. Color unimpressed Wired.com article doesnt link single study

And im asking AIDs claim   permission call laws variant factories? case study one individual. Absolutely zero value really

edit: plus im asking made claim AIDs Maybe already immune recovered virus? Gamble money - health! Great time get rid masks open nightclubs. like taking stuff either facts COVID way worse terms known damage community refuses take reasonable measures reduce spread (like masks), refuses vaccine non emotional risk analysis risk perspective vaccine best lowest risk option- especially teens jam-packed classrooms 7 hours day come August. 

If want delay taking vaccine MUST part reduce spread vaccine avoidant people want continue precautions either. nothing = help COVID spread mutate morally defenable posture ethicl systems Americans subscribe to. Damn. unvaxed people get play sacred timeline don’t?  Available adults. 

Not children. unable receive it. 

They selfish. It’s exhausting.  Vegas hot Hades time year temperature-wise usually isn’t popular unless getting rays poolside (get skin cancers started).  casinos air conditioned many love walking “the Strip” hitting restaurants. Thing won’t cool way midnight. 

May uptick people wanting last splurge returning work. 

Hope they’ve vaccinated .. people headed back home states spread it.

It’s going long, hot, Covid summer. vaccines cause super 5g autism   identified enemy. true vaccine even vaccines. Feb 2nd 7 people died covid, soooo everyone died since unvaccinated. That's chaps hide. stop listening Facebook chain letters get asses get vaccine doses, folks. even need everyone, 80% everyone. 20% refuse hopeless morons anyway. sit 50% variants keep coming. Thank much think is. comment makes concern delta variant sound hysterical overblown, nation's top disease experts urging caution delta variant likely cause resurgences areas low vaccination rates (e.g Missouri Arkansas). Variant prunes. Gives right runs, do. little trick hospital managers want know about!

Covid variants HATE one simple trick Y’all spoiling stuff barely week old major show Covid subreddit. Come on. least try mark spoilers. Southern drawl: ""That's *Miss* Minutes, y'all!"" :-) resistance pressure, bad, slowly mutating virus. experts worries much part dumbasses citizens poor countries continue give virus millions infections needs mutate. ivermectin treatments even nearly profitable vaccines require booster shots every six months year. comment say? I'm sorry bad case COVID. way everyone - one friends COVID barely worse vaccine symptoms. got vaccine, said bad actual COVID him.  Unless able force antivaxer jab chances information going go one ear evolution works   hard enough people start wearing masks, way going sustain summer. sure going able tell vaccinated people continue wearing masks months. One unvaccinated co-workers finally got first shot company said fully vaccinated people wear masks office started getting worried Delta variant. anti-vaxer, ""it's new know side effects"" person actually sort clicked Covid going go away ignore getting vaccinated. got covid vaccine

the vaccine 1000x worse lmao Let's real, preaching countries wheelchair ramps elevators mean handicapped people good go need accessibilities assistance.

It's able-bodied world and, enough us able-bodied people see care it, nothing gonna change ""they've taking care far"".

And I'm saying keep mask mandates restrictions forever, necessarily agree there, need create spaces people still at-risk safe least ways access spaces safely. one said 100%, virus effective means little chance serious infection. Also carry lot less viral load ao spread among vaccinated population low chance others. JRE #1671 favorite response right to, one hold force get it.

But judge putting others risk, makes twat something utterly basic, save lives health others.  It’s tragic success fight pandemic depends one thing human beings worst - united. people would unite, agree take vaccines given them, mask up/stay home necessary, fight would hard. got unite fight together. Density one key benefits urban centers, though. It’s feature, bug. 

Also, masking winters especially you’re sick great idea… time? Security issues aside, humans social forever. expect ppl live like never implied did. covid make immune. Gotta milk upvotes since reddit beaten friend? vaccinated people!

I’m pro vax, literally every carrier actively infected person vector. Regardless much country opening restricting, please remember takes 1 person generate “echo” variant could go back square 1.

Get vaccinated, wear mask, responsible  Ah, ""Dumbass Leak"" origin theory 1000% correct. vaccine get?

Outside really well fitting varieties floppy surgical masks cutesy little thing Etsy paper armor. 

However, mask *does* vaccine *doesn't* give subconscious sense control psychological feeling ""Active Protection"" even though vaccine actually MUCH BETTER. vaccine though invisible flowing around blood, feel like there's suit armor protecting you. So, end ""I dunno, vaccines ain't 100%, imma throw thin Spongebob mask got Dollar general"" mentalities. take responsibility actions? personally happily take COVID shot every months means deal lockdown event again. Thanks, able comprehend without FYI.   want live that’s fine. people still want wear masks that’s fine, even it’s forever. fine expecting everyone live like you. want live again, go concerts plays, travel again, go back person university, see family wonders life . got vaccine protect vulnerable also get normal life back. one wild precious life hope live fullest. hope live life way that’s fulfilling you, even radically different mine. bad teeth highly contagious. would okay prison time someone knowingly, intentionally neglectful smallpox ebola. didn’t get sticker either. disappointed. 570,000 dead Americans year. 

With one simple trick less dead less people complications lung infections.   TBH seem bad. would guessed number higher.  nuance sometimes missed situation vast majority people vaccinated, majority infectious spread among group, unvaccinated. statistical reality. 

Unvaccinated people susceptible long term severe exposure, making likely create variant strains. 

But since still minority create minority risk.  Daniel Griffin made clear TWiV today low risk kids doesn’t mean risk. I'm sure mRNA vaccines freely available anytime year Ireland. there's lot J&amp;J supply, actually option.

I'm 21 since rollout adults expected complete least September would put getting first mRNA end August. predicted cases go. see that's I'm thinking AZ might worth since transmission high.  explained really.

Do think actions affect others? Ya confused! thought might missed news FDA approved news sky blue water wet. Chad sports report. think splitting hairs really hammer home difference hard.

 Yes, EUA full approval different processes. Physicians universally recommending get vaccinated either way.  Good know. Hopefully also protects variants.  Paywall.    going matter much. still work situations described. related, usually inversely.

Covid long incubation period infectious serious symptoms (along large number asymptomatic people).

If takes month kill become immune infectious 3 weeks difference someone dying day 30 becoming immune day 30. Either way removed pool people reinfected. kind morals subscribe say care actions affect others? Gee... happen?! understand saying apologize clear. I'm talking us wear grocery, doct appt, etc. hour 2 day. imagine difficult wear 10hrs day, yes. Again, headline makes sound like better unvaccinated rather get AZ 39 years old. 


I'm sure explain encouraging notion bad news. Sorry late answer! basically paralized legs 3 dans straight. Tachicardia also, I'm bradycardiac (46 bpm resting, 39 night). 39C fever two days. Brain fog 10 days, could barely read, basically phone avoid headaches. 9th day blood clot scare right leg abandoned walk! Nobody could tell though. Though experience. Still getting AZ 2nd dose. simply favor simple changes like wearing masks social distancing.

Wearing masks social distancing *forever* ""simple changes"" like suggest. people wear masks unrealistic asking everyone wear clothing upper body (shirts, tops, t-shirts).

That's absolutely untrue know it.

 wanna keep stubbornly suggesting things, go ahead. It'll never happen.  too! Very! Highly recommend. Honest question - hearing mentions multiple scientists also high likelihood vaccine resistant variants coming vaccinated people singular vaccine works (not sure singular correct word basically tells bodies make spike proteins). vaccinated people still shed virus, highly likely virus evolve make vaccines less effective. thoughts/evidence proving/disproving this?  Yes, safe. dont like facts here. Yup. Food 'calories' lot people, comfort, socialization, fun, something share others, etc, etc.  It’s really good.

I'm exactly wishing death anyone, really nature thing Feels like COVID cases nothing … nothing … nothing warning. vaccinated spicy  evolution series accidents, goal. virus mutates, mutation either proves beneficial proliferates, hinders way proliferates less. time, pressures acting virus mean it’s deadlier less beneficial mutation killing hosts needs, whereas less deadly mutation spread more. would compounded humans would react stronger deadlier variant (lockdowns, social distancing, etc). Again, there’s goal here, deadlier variant could arise wipe lot people out, doesn’t make successful virus. common cold, believe number different viruses, could considered successful it’s mild rarely kills, reinfect hosts, we’ll probably never go effort stamping out. could say there’s goal virus, maximum proliferation, lethality.  Well clearly didn’t get past basic biology high school assuming statement. doesn’t mean vaccines prevent variants, variants occurring infection mutating unvaccinated people allows faster development RNA viruses. vaccine slows mutations less less people getting actual infection. Eventually either mutates dies, mutation becomes less hassle. Like annual flu shot. Vaccinated people ones causing mutations moment yes unvaccinated - road people vaccinated mutations stem both. takes lot longer - remember thing called herd immunity, that’s purpose getting vaccine. crossover never expected Loki like banking interest. Compound interest. Well, yes since vaccines 100% frail people still severely affected succumb even mild infections.

At least USA political tribalism real problem vaccination seems align tribe one belongs to.

However, strictly politics, Social Media plays role, peer pressure plays role, fact article posted sub recently peer pressure big reason one get vaccinated. 

There question right large part political viewpoints play massive role determining whether one vaccinated not, sad imho.

My wife often wonders outloud folks politics determines whether get vaccine not, realizes people developed vaccines motivated politics, motivated ability save lives.  , least area NRW easily book appointment Biontech . Earliest free spot wednesday morning . concludes using vaccine entire adult population would avert 10 deaths Covid among 18-39-year-olds, would associated 21 deaths blood clotting age grouping time period.

No, article already done adjustment specifically states death risk double.

There also collateral damage people might reluctant get vaccines enough young people die clots due AZ.     Well, basic everyone except kids indoctrinated creationism home anyway picture rescue workers look like ready already retired. less likely form vaccinated people, immune system dispatch virus quickly won’t much chance reproduce many generations evolve

I'm biologist, best guess killing host side-effect viruses work survival mechanism itself. Think way: viruses enslave cells. People slaves known work death, human beings, matter cruel are, usually least rational enough want protect investment keeping slaves healthy. virus ability act rationally, lot time kill host simply know better.

Across many generations, virus evolve way mimics rationality, viruses keep hosts alive tend lot better overall. lot successful viruses, like HPV HSV, never fatal often completely asymptomatic. suspect viruses even successful cause visible symptoms all, therefore nothing stop spreading. know viruses like there's reason care them, virologist might. Nice try there's couple flaws shitty argument

1. Blood clots always mean going die, 15-25% people blood clots end dead. 

2. AZ offers lot protection COVID -19 youre definitely likely die unvaccinated vaccinated AZ.

I like you, anti vaxxer. like what's Maybe many Covid know one shot enough? Various studies countries around world take one dose approach recovered.

If it’s unnecessary second dose certain group, can’t expect take it. harm benefit person, benefits pharmaceutical company. They'd probably rather referred virus job creators. Also, understand, India's government decided COVID over, plus low vaccination rate led massive wave. People take precautions late avoid. Imagine family inadvertently killing one another. last year time, going point vast majority humans unable grasp exponential progression. unwilling learn it, lack education it. amount education practice help. brains simply perform function well enough anticipate outcome matter hard try. mean think stupid. perfectly normal human characteristic.

Doubling every [X] period exponential progression. minority people grasp urgency essential majority convinced way. I've loop lately aside hearing bits delta varient. Anyone know (even though I'm guessing speculation) might full FDA approval phizer vaccine? Also, can't freaking wait till young kids get green light. okay. That's good distinction.  vaccine safe, reduce severity covid symptoms contracted, decrease chance acquiring long covid, reduce chance spread virus contracted. Well, come first shot! ^(j/k) God damnit, wish idiots would part get vaccine. Instead, deal indefinitely. goal may may deadly depending benefits most. still simple organism things help spread/evolve may also make deadly byproduct core focus. instance, driving car faster makes complete task transportation better, also makes deadly tradeoff still better overall. God damnit, wish idiots would part get vaccine. Instead, get this. Jump ropes really cheap opposed what? There's thing ""no risk"". 

But we're talking healthy kids 18, need locking anything masking anything protect covid. die average flu season died covid. first shot pretty painless second one made arm sore first one. sure injection. barely felt first injection second dose felt like literal jab lol. 

I'm feeling weird atm sure that's body performing autoimmune response hungry and/or joining fully vaxxed gang!

Thanks! can't believe people would refuse take shot information. take vaccine that's deadly virus itself?

Taking 17-20% another reply, assuming worst 20%, wind roughly 60% less likely die result versus risk getting assumes 100% vaccine efficiency, it'll closer 50% less likely die overall account small chance still getting COVID vaccinated. guessing thoughts increase

1. Delta legit making people fearful getting it

2. School ending means teens might likely get dont risk missing school

3. People planning travel summer want protected We've delay vaccinating students company employees planned we're running short supplies. Supplies left sitting around rot figured even begin distributing. gov IOC still gun ho hosting Olympics.

Pray us, we're Banzai right major Covid outbreak.  Proliferation requires replication - vaccines going create variants faster pace natural infection. antivaxxers trying falsely apply this. important remember propaganda environment discussing possible scenarios.
Vaccines still better always superior letting run rampant yhe current tech easily adaptable variants change spike protein significantly. (remember virus needs gain entry cell would need mutation preserved purpose escaping antibodies every defense - pretty damn tricky) hear 8th wave predicted real hell storm. won’t arrive early 2022. Mutations less likely form vaccinated people, immune system dispatch virus quickly won’t much chance reproduce many generations evolve. 

If anyone going provide many generations virus it’ll unvaccinated person, provide virus time (hopefully) fought off.

Because give virus opportunity evolve, people going unvaccinated might produce strain significantly different original point able infect vaccinated people, we’ll again. That’s it’s important everyone get vaccinated get vaccinated. two variants one person duking out, person vaccinated, obviously resistant variant going win. pressure exerted virus unvaccinated person would favor resistant variant? downvoted? truth lol Germany still requiring appointments?

Data Scotland shows 60-80% protection offered depending vaccine.

Didn’t Covid cause myocarditis anyway? friend lives rural Missouri told year almost one wears mask. area vaccinated. vaccinated wears mask times. know Delta variant causing significant mortality unvaccinated populations India Russia. still need see behaves vaccinated populations elsewhere.

We don’t really know India never massive outbreak Delta variant spread there. one big wave one “holy shit gtfo” wave. know deaths rose line would expect massive outbreak. Even earlier wave relatively similar case death count. still see lot people wearing DC proper, especially grocery stores. wanna say 60/40 mask/no mask Trader Joe’s today. every often store requires them, always make sure one leave apartment, even never put on. nowhere go regularly, apart public transit, requires anymore. Everywhere risk measles outbreaks. point make easier Measles. 

There’s reason Ireland’s entire outbreak measles patients could fit single decker bus Romania’s killed 20 children infected 2,000. 

The virus Ireland literally nowhere go. handily interruptible. one Romania able run rampant even infect foreign countries.  Yep, proud it. Wow, that's extra effort show Astrazeneca much really want vaccine... ;-) me! It’s situation Ireland arrogance ignorance point outside Don’t get it? outbreak demonstrated Ireland remains risk measles outbreaks due persistent suboptimal vaccination rates. retracted.  Oh, I’m heading Brasov morning skate (they real ice rink… anyway...) I’m sorry can’t remember much since last time years ago, find anything cool weekend I’ll update. :)

Sigisoara lovely semi preserved medieval city time drive there.

Btw, driving mountains crazy people passing blind curves going probably stress bit. Bran castle pretty neat see photos from, bunch castles around too.

If get Bucharest time please consider eating meal two Zexe. It’s amazing food prices features foods typical nobility couple centuries ago.

I find weird cool buildings admire walking around, it’s kind hard say “check out,” it’s cohesive? walked along portion Dacia blvd today *some* interesting architecture example, don’t know would want wander along that. Old town cool, want see something different try refine walk around ‘hood list. :) feel free message.

I highly recommend going village museum think cool old buildings interesting. relocated many old structures across country, love place. depends kind stuff though. Also, spread happened Ireland literally Romanian. bad making argument you’ve actually made mine, again. Yeah, that's correct way put it. Yea, facts alone aren’t enough? wrong? It’s like said fear flying, knowing it’s safe isn’t enough overcome fear. It’s one thing person chooses get one, sure fine, everyone else hasn’t they’re worried, scared, shouldn’t counted basket.  I'm glad hear this! friend Singapore still gotten yet (just become available yet). need guys get vaccination rates up! love visit part world tourism can't open back people safe. Prayers guys, stay safe keep vaccinating! addition, government decided convert lending 55,000 doses AstraZeneca Schleswig-Holstein donation. vaccine doses delivered Schleswig-Holstein 10 May scheduled returned Denmark 7 July.

They changed mind :) lmao tool make huge difference. reason Pfizer outperformed Astra trials, Pfizer 2-shot, Astra 1 shot, 2 doses AZ provides nearly protection 2 doses Pfizer. Even describe legally possible ethically acceptable (which doubt), problem go away. still faced doctors nurses working limits weeks end, chances mistakes, etc., rises dramatically.

And nurses simply pack show work cannot take anymore? Thanks! do! Thanks! Appreciate Facts...Also, us got vaccine, idea even help us. (Compromised immune system) truly understand people get point? soo many people sense human decency? hasn’t yet established unmasking vaccinated people safe zero risk adverse effect. Much safer still excellent result. Hopefully people get vaccinated. wonder placebo plays role hmmmm ""How child getting sick problem?""

Holy fuckballs Batman. lost IQ points reading comments. really glad hear US this. I’m terribly sorry lost father hope smooth easy get second doses time comes. hotspots emerging across country, fueled highly transmissible delta variant lagging vaccination rates, California, Nevada, Missouri Arkansas. Yup, casinos making money pre-covid! believe, technically, Schleswig-Holstein doses loan, donation. ;-) Yes, that’s diseases spread fucking moron. That’s literally point.

Group foreign town decides say vaccines, subsequently catches easily preventable disease. leave said town spread disease people also choose say vaccines can’t take medical reasons (allergies, weakened immune system). 

Then disease spreads mutates spreads mutates congratulations, you’re burning corpses hazmat suits 6.01 news.

Read fucking history book, world terrible place vaccination. people “choose” say vaccinations, happens.  exist 100% effective vaccines. Biology weird complicated enough nothing medicine 100%. main way deal vaccines [herd vaccinate enough people less 100% effective vaccines protect population. sure would way complicated make completely unaffordable average citizen.

If something like could even invented. (at zero risk adverse effects transmitting).

This directly false. measurable percentage transmissions vaccinated people (which affect safety, see instance), really good data adverse effect (though certainly assume small).

Science says risk low, zero. Humans choose level risk worthwhile. taxpayer dollars also pay hospitalizations unvaccinated, absolutely still pretty high cost us anti-sciencers choose COVID vaccination. Also, asking anti-sciencers wear masks pointless, thing public health left asking rational people so. let's pretend wartime.. advice would also consequences. could come home chose - rolled dice lost simple (pets excuse? give break) . I'm curious United States many people still wearing masks? Around Chicago metro, see many masks. significant number people wearing masks part country? Hell, calling something like Covid-19 normal horrible enough  India scamming people shocked!!!! Wonder also worked critical Microsoft support  Somewhere probably. bet UK sort built immunity since they've getting hit year. Australia large doesn't. We've done year; would different? We're paying businesses close can't rational response pandemic, health care costs incurred (payed tax dollars) choose COVID vaccination, ultimately long-term healthcare burden neither die fully recover. wanted say government done anything revert tens years distrust mismanagement one year. Also government, authority general. Even western governments medical experts said vaccines safe recommended, people still trust them. institutions people trust army church... That'd make sense actually, gotta figure even military setting everyone could pop doctor pretty quickly lots people mild cases even bother. I’ve arguing country’s subreddit this, people actually think someone CHOOSES get vaccine shouldn’t frowned upon. Like seriously… you’re selfish ignorant course I’m gonna treat differently. Ireland - - national measles outbreak Ireland linked single imported case, April September, 2016. labelling nation idiots make bigger idiot. critical thinking? Well, yeah, Romania hit hesitancy wall Missouri resident here!

St. Louis County looks highest percentage people fully vaccinated… whopping 43%.

In words George Carlin “people fucking dumb.” Yeah, sounds like intelligent policy. large percentage population vaccinated would different story case risk it?   Wondering cycle people like 36% current population confirmed case Pre-pandemic almost 1 20. one silver lining whole fiasco, it’s hippie/woo faction port side aisle come grips fact compadres nut jobs starboard side. Same. ""made mistake"" ignoring scientists screaming get vaccinated, refuse to? I'd call moron. that's me. Holy balls. think must near herd immunity detected + undetected infections + whoever get vaccinated? individual community large. mentality like put vulnerable medically compromised (to point cannot receive vaccine) risk, fault own.

Basically, fighting right selfish people act selfishly infringes health safety say matter. 

Also, Covid = mutations = potentially worse Covid strains slamming community again. Romania measles outbreak 2016. Dozens children died Measles. disease deaths door. nation unfortunately filled anti-vaccine morons.

It’s arrogant ignorant call nation state that’s failing eradicate disease almost extinct fucking thing 5 years later. 

It blind luck lot hard work dedicated experts that’s reason haven’t gotten much deadlier disease COVID thanks idiots. Taipei, July 2 (CNA) Taiwan Friday reported 58 new cases COVID-19, falling 100 eighth straight day, 15 people died disease cases discovered Taipei wholesale market created uncertainty outbreak's path.

Speaking daily Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) press briefing, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said recent outbreak continues ease, new cases confirmed wholesale market Wanhua District needed closely monitored.

Taipei reported earlier Friday 41 vendors market tested positive COVID-19, none included Friday's tallies.

The cases discovered vendors site tested COVID-19 nearby First Fruit &amp; Vegetable Wholesale Market reported cluster infection late June.

The PCR screening program test around 2,800 individuals Huannan Market another 8,400 people First Second Fruit &amp; Vegetable Wholesale Markets July 1 3.
It known many people Huannan Market tested get 41 positive results.

More cases could discovered testing continues, operations Huannan Market suspended July 5 fully disinfected, Chen said.

Using government's contact tracing app, text messages also sent to anyone visited market past days urge get tested COVID-19, Chen said.

According CECC, expects contacts infected vendors identified quarantined Saturday, special command center set Huannan Market monitor situation there.

Friday's new cases brought total country 14,911, around 13,500 domestic infections reported since May 15, country first recorded 100 COVID-19 cases single day.

The 15 deaths reported eight men seven women, 40s 80s, passed away June 3 June 30, CECC said.
To date, 676 people Taiwan died COVID-19, including 664 since May 15.

Of 57 new domestic cases reported Thursday, 29 Taipei 15 New Taipei.

Hsinchu County reported four cases, three Taoyuan Keelung. Taichung reported two cases Hsinchu City one, CECC data showed.

No new case reported cluster Pingtung County caused Delta variant.

Among 57 cases, six unclear links cases, 23 investigated 28 known source infection, CECC said.

The one imported case, meanwhile, Taiwanese national 50s, entered Taiwan June 28 Hungary, CECC said.

(By Chiang Hui-chun Lee Hsin-Yin) disagree. Children grow adults susceptible Covid same. don’t know sane person would want child catch Covid develop antibodies natural infection (if that’s insinuating) versus vaccination targeted produce antibodies.
Especially many schools requiring 7-14-28 days pass Covid-positive kid return. stop learning loss becomes issue, allow schools get back work without charade (and expense) security theater. “We need remove fear world again” “Dear working poor person, please go back work keep consuming enough wealth weather coming collapse society due man-made global warming.”

Or maybe Xyonik wants fun. can't recall single pre-print academic article claiming that. People hoped virus would attenuate mild like swine flu did, guarantee. Canadians! Yay Canada! wish Irish people could express gratefully reasonably like did. Many comments social media pity demonstrate appalling arrogance ignorance. condolences father. 

Take easy rest weekend. Treat something!  last part something agree on, note hesitation focusing literally one spot country cases rising in. Anyways, it’s unclear messaging would appeal people point. Frankly imagine need republican leaders (the ones like like Trump) come encourage vaccination maybe robust incentive programs.

But give people credit, lived village 10,000 already coronavirus wave months ago, probably wouldn’t prioritizing shot either aren't. understand myocarditis overwhelmingly comes autoimmune reaction virus (the antibodies created virus looks like heart reaction heart occurs). antibodies vaccines spike protein incredibly similar infection (though make much less antibodies vaccination).

Flat out, everyone got vaccinated, rate myocarditis would go compared everyone getting covid. see thing guillan barre, myocarditis type 1 diabetes rates going get flu vaccine compared get flu Well, yes. Exactly point... happens media pushes propaganda. happening bit US, resistance create large enough offset benefits vaccines.....yet 
 
If ever another pandemic sure many wear masks get go.....thanks propaganda spread left unchecked certain media outlets time around. 3 months, definitely call doctor! maybe they’re going fully FDA approved soon

IIRC, Pfizer applied full FDA approval least month ago (and Moderna little after), saying ""September"" actually conservative.  gonna happen, vaccines less 100 percent effective, know (as vaccines ever). reason number 784 I'll keep masking distancing whatever cdc say. Stupid vaccinated flanders  point medical institutions need simply instruct unvaccinated ride home authority order ankle bracelets ensure compliance. really need risk lives medical staff opted vax. include medical staff opted well. us followed guidelines, got shot, survived shutdowns, unwilling go thru another shutdown anti-vaxers; need shutdown, me. If/when fall wave hits, unvaxed need ordered home confinement, vaccinated. Hungary EU country such, receiving vaccines distributed EU (Pfizer, Moderna, AZ, J&amp;J). also decided buy Sputnik Sinopharm EU *slow* first months year (if compared USA, UK, Israel) Paywalls help one, copy paste whole articles? maths based numbers making up. 10% stupidly low many would argue 20% low too. higher numbers delta obviously less pronounced. Get shots kids 💉💉 Yellow Journalism finest. 10.5 million residents Los Angeles county - 400/500 Covid infections surge. winter numbers (20,000 daily infections) surge. LA County numbers going see increase state opened mid June. children get vaccinations (hopefully September) Covid numbers disperse quickly. got Pfizer shots Friday mornings worked night doubles Saturday Sunday restaurant completely fine little arm soreness. don’t scared severe reactions. cousin covid October, got first shot end Feb. Within 6 hours getting spot vomiting, diarrhea, body aches, fever. Basically covid like 36 hours. Didn’t nearly bad reaction second time. brainwashed big-pharma communist shadow government secret 5G transmissions. Obviously. 


/s someone numbers UK instead? must it. fastest way pandemic! Probably kids 6-12 won’t get vaccinated til October 1-5 December next year. 

That’s bummer tests must cautious them. surprised sensible doctors already left country COVID greener pastures. Like dividing choose steal don't? went pretty much symptoms (diarrhea, pink eye, lost smell/taste, general feeling fatigue feeling always slightly breathe) except cough fever. Thankfully, symptoms pretty mild taking 2 weeks recover month really ""fully"" get back normal. got vaccinated, aside normal sore arm also felt little feverish. I've also feeling queasy fatigued since wednesday. Though, feel better today yesterday. Yes mean vaccinated person anything worry about. Hopefully ten percent make rational choice work nurses doctors work around irrational phobia Fucking timekeepers died covid  uncle allergic reaction first doctor told get second dose. 🤷🏻‍♂️ *”We talking scenarios making vaccination obligatory exposed serious consequence COVID - talking senior citizens, first doctors,"" said.*

**doctors**. What. The. Fuck. 

I can’t anymore. tf healthcare watches people die *still isn’t vaccinated*? 

I don’t understand. even little bit. Avoid unnecessary prolonged (15m+) indoor exposure strangers (or known unvaccinated people) especially poorly ventilated small spaces. wear mask. gov pays non insured. get don’t provide ins don’t get paid gov. issue technical legalities, think (?)

Since jabs still EUA fully approved don’t think army, federal entity, make jabs mandatory, maybe they’re going fully FDA approved soon/they found legal thing enables despite still EUA:d.

I could completely wrong tho Well duh. basic high school biology ubermensch immune system folks something else. allowed compete olympics, superwoman Good *used

I don’t expect know difference though. Thanks much three months. lump noticed like three days ago.
Thank appreciate reply. took long? last month working nurse COVID unit hospital prohibiting us using anything better droplet mask well knowing patient room COvid chance getting inches away patient. know that's required socially distance. cant really socially distance critically I'll patient taking care of. like think way, get bit sick vaccine, then, disease would kill without protection vaccine. 

&amp;#x200B;

And know, dieing covid-19 preventable disease something would like future. 

Please go full vaccination cycle. Vaccines free US though P.1 Brazilian variant called Gamma.

Florida stronger links South America, Gamma prevalent Delta last report, Delta growing faster. Okay read ten percent people get jabs might phobia article Moderna.

I probably also say got first shot, 2 hours later boss called inform co-worker worked directly close proximity (the car, worked/traveled together) covid. it’s possible covid shot time. 13 year old reaction 1st dose, fever, chills, sweats, nausea (my kid puked, not) 2nd dose. MMR booster last year family take flu shot yearly. never reaction vaccines. lymph nodes swollen 5 days after. siblings spouses almost side effects. happen, people able discuss without accused lying ulterior motives discouraging vaccine. Oh I’m going anywhere anyone here, know sentiment around one cancel poor weather, they’ll definitely move indoors. likely vaccinated aside everyone &lt;12. could something else tbh  what? Good fuck. vaccine get?

Edit: old you? sounds like got myocarditis they've talking Things change. Effectiveness changes. people received vaccine would agree unfortunately chose selfish. know people immunocompromised won’t risk giving them. thought that’s society supposed work, care others, year rude awakening lump couldn’t really seen raise arm. It’s sun overweight anything, I’m fit it’s nearly impossible see it. Hence went doctor third day, hesitant help

Pressing armpit felt lump wasn’t really painful rather like it’s “full”. Like wasn’t space anymore

The lump lasted like 5 days want see effect highlighted, checkout Indonesia UK worldometer. case graphs fairly similar (I think stunted UK, still big upswing) upswings start time. death graphs different. wait TVA start taking away varients Im14andthisisdeep Pfizer vaccine--first shot left feeling tired. Second one strong immune response. 102F temp, body aches, malaise. snowed benadryl ativan, sleeping it. Felt better 8 hours later That's call ""Public"" Health. person's actions affect others. making stats go along. Lol (sic). Well lucky mRNA vaccines updated quickly. least heard, one benefits rapidly developed updated new variants emerge. Vaccine meal?

sign up!

This whole original tweet thread comment section basically pushing anti-vax talking points:

“I’m seeing 2 3 break cases *a day* feed” (in one area, country, world?)

“Here another thread experience fully vaccinated, feeling safe encouraged believe that, finding firsthand COVID-19 passed vaccinated individuals providers insist rare”

I can’t believe people seriously trying discredit one thing going get us thing shocked people don’t get vaccine. Yeah chance spread low outside spread really exist much even areas there's low vaccination rates. guess festivities area. plan going. Yes, countries like Germany regard fully vaccinated one shot PCR-confirmed COVID. Anti-vaxxers generally make last long US military. Refusing vaccinated FDA-approved vaccine ordered punishable UCMJ.  enlist commissioned basically consent getting whatever vaccine military tells get, bring date boosters/anything missed.  Active duty servicemembers required get yearly flu shot.  

While law requiring informed consent servicemembers get vaccines EUA, waived President national security reasons.  law came due controversy military anthrax vaccinations around 20 years ago. What?  lump almost certainly swollen lymph nodes vaccine. Nothing concerned about, call doctor help put mind ease. gone week enlarged lymph nodes may feel like lump little tender, may notice all, Dr. Roy adds. generally appear within days vaccination feel 10 days—and may visible imaging tests month, says. still feel two weeks shot, call doctor, 4 NOTABLE variants definitively changed way virus transmitted. don’t say 4. also tracking 7 Variants Interest Yep. got shots ten years military entire childhood. even mandate annual flu shot. deployed Iraq get smallpox shot, forms big blister arm. Covid shot walk park comparison that. 

People military used shots, hence already high Covid vaccination rate among troops. There's tons small variants died out... 4 matter. fine cause delta killing ton people unvaccinated... won’t. told people get vaccinated won’t wear masks. studies show vaccines effective big mean scary delta variant. You’ll hard pressed get even people like masked distanced year go back that. Yeah people get covid vaccination going asymptomatic good Absolutely nada first Pfizer shot. bit sore arm felt bit buzz, actual unpleasant feeling, like little light headed nothing like ""damn want end"". wife same. fever hours second shot, completely fine next day. Going second shot today. Covaxin handling Delta Variant Hospitalization well mRNA vaccines (Trials held among 25000+ people India 25+ sites time Delta Variant led 2nd wave peak India)

Comparing Delta effectiveness Pfizer vs AZ vs Covaxin

Hospitalization (after 2 doses) : 96% vs 92% vs 93.4%

Sources Pfizer AZ data (Covaxin Data already Holy shit, sore arm like 4 hours. know symptoms vaccine bad. understanding government cover cost administering vaccine flat rate. providers like CVS went insurance went government’s flat rate. either case vaccine recipient charged nothing. Idk liked Anecdotal, children local schools got compared waves. Europe/Delta variant That's good sign though. contracted covid need get tested vaccines work. Rationality. love man. 

“There’s sort isolated parts country you’re seeing infection levels rise. rest country looks good,” Gottlieb said. “I think you’re seeing decoupling places high vaccination rates places low vaccination rates. You’re also, quite frankly, seeing decoupling cases extreme death disease virus causing.”

In nations high vaccination rates also rising cases due delta variant, U.K. Israel, “hospitalizations deaths aren’t increasing” manner earlier global health crisis, Gottlieb said.

“For while, thought lagging effect don’t see hospitalizations pick three, four weeks see cases start rise, deaths,” said Gottlieb, led FDA 2017 2019 Trump administration.

“But point, enough trend suggest you’re going see decoupling right you’re going see extreme outcomes virus parts world vaccination rates high, includes United States.” Pretty spot covid last year April, nyc hit hard. Since still worked got exposed. insane sharp pain chest coughing night could still taste Catholic, good thing Vatican specifically said getting vaccine allowed Every vaccine shot comes free packet crayons! say lot things called expert.

Interesting article though. developer vaccine pretty much said thing. It’s going create mutations. live it. vaccines. Well kids masked least live. Rather distancing playing together,going camps, parties, exposed adults unvacinated.

Viruses deadly spread quickly kill host halts spread. order virus mutate become highly contagious must become less deadly.

It's evolving common cold aunt died night supposed get 2nd shot ): (not COVID, passed sleep) constant variants never jab everyone time eradicate next variant comes. one time jab fine not. bother math, whole thing BS, think number they're claiming would lot less that... Maybe joking. They're saying 2 dead per 3 dead covid. hundreds thousands dead vaccine, maybe low millions depending they're projecting people would died vaccines thing everyone got covid. part reason cancer common too. kills reproductive age, evolution can't really select it. got 2 shots 2 different pharmacy chains. looking doses/patient pharmacy might count 2 those.  knowledge isn’t proof that. unvaccinated provide platform new variants evolve.

The mRNA vaccines train immune systems recognize structure Covid virus’ spikes. Thus far, they’ve done good job recognizing spike among variants. concern variants may emerge spikes (or protein structures) unrecognizable. I’m guessing read link provided person replied you, deeper dive, wherein realize wrong were? Let know really good attitude have. starting ""there's reasoning them"" position, step aside let someone else convince them.

Here Canada sizable number people anti-vax, hesitant. talk ask why, reasonable conversation fears. vaccines provide level immunity like flu, suggest? Lockdowns forever?

If ""lockdowns forever"" mean ""people areas low vaccination rates need wear mask grocery store rates increase slightly,"" yes.

You're making common-sense policies sound outrageously unworkable aren't. Animals also factor less important. variant evolves non-human animal would evolved better infect particular animal. Oddballs still possible though time become less less issue. got demand something like 3 billion people Earth wanting vaccine right now, limited supply. 2-3 years time, demand far less, probably, stays high, supply also follow.  assume mean (2x Pfizer 2x Moderna). studies mixing mRNA (one each) there’s data yet. Canada mixing assumption least *as* effective possibly effective don’t know either way yet (we supply imbalance) second Moderna shot absolutely wrecked 24 hours. fever 103 highest, body aches, nausea, vomiting whole flu symptom gambit. didn’t expect effect truthfully I’ve never anything sore arm flu shots. way wrong. symptoms completely went away 24 hours starting even though felt worst I’ve ever felt I’d absolutely get two shots knowing may feel. may sound callous, people need toughen they’re able take day deal that. able definite problem country way long seriously needs addressed, people definitely understand hesitancy. do! well! Wow, keep preaching message unity then, brother. Enjoy life turtles.  Let's go 3 - 5 years. long enough measure fertility/birth defects. Long-term immunity, effectiveness etc. count positive tests 1.6 million roughly 10% population says much actual number people infected. can't use 10% reasoning. Air bags also lethal, much dangerous go without them.

Not taking vaccines risk like wearing seat belts air bags. mutate deadlier variant (there's nothing biologically stops this, mutations essentially random), time less lethal variants typically selected for.

So average, time goes on, COVID get less deadly. deadlier strain always possibility, albeit less less likely. get sentiment time, society can’t revolve around protecting at-risk groups indefinitely.

People immunocompromised pre-existing conditions take individual action protect long Covid, won’t different pandemic gone. can’t expect everyone mask/distance indefinitely keep safe.

If kid 12 right now, it’s situation. Keep crowded indoor spaces make sure they’re wearing mask go out. can’t keep mask on, don’t let go unsupervised. school online handle make sure schools don’t become crowded. job requires regular contact little kids, like teaching childcare, wear mask work get tested going frequently hours. best strategies might actually make difference protecting kids.

The main thing healthy people regular contact vulnerable groups judge people they’re still wearing mask and/or social distancing. Respect people situation you, reasons, choosing stay vigilant. might make jealous it’s incredibly frustrating vaccinated Americans. could moving this, donating vaccines, etc. Instead we’re stuck kind time warp.  high barrier state that, honest, trouble getting citizens vaccinated. take action, words. Bingo. wish people understood more. Covid spread well kills victim, there's little chance less deadly variant overtake deadly one. would need complete random chance one becoming virulent less lethal time, whereas Spanish flu easily overtaken less deadly variant kill hosts couple days.  Look state world today.....sure hell know turtles  SARS variants going happen. 

I'll wait there's expert consensus this, think there's ton evidence support idea variants ""going happen"" *no matter what* due animal reservoirs. Seems like excuse ignore role unvaccinated people prolonging pandemic. wear N95 mask.

However, vaccine best protection available  ""people"" much?  low vaccinations. unvaccinated people, much higher roof.  worries. upvote caring. 

People get emotional political, downvoting posts like irrespective whether correct not. Post data two different subs one gets upvoted downvoted, that's reddit you. heard many virologists say healthy vaccinated people actually expose themselfs virus, immune system learns whole virus, spike protein vaccines, future mutated variant becomes able get vaccination, people exposed whole virus much better protected.

I haven’t heard anyone say something like that, let alone “many virologists.” call BS one flagged misinformation review mods.

The messaging I’ve heard pretty much unanimously avoid exposure sars-cov-2…

If you’re able provide proof “many virologists” saying this, please so. Otherwise lying giving potentially harmful advice people. People.... confused subreddit 10 seconds (I've commenting Loki subreddit)    Unless wearing N95, wearing cloth/surgical mask protection. stopping spreading others.

An N95 provide good protection you.  they?  Where's proof variants deadlier original Yup, good all. 

However, 1 death reported, 8 hospitalised hospital 0 ICU today. Let's hope rise together cases stays current low level.  state set clear order vaccinations didn’t start healthy young firefighters spent better part year getting sick. didn’t make rules. They're reporting results study. Many countries already restricted AZ older cohorts. see bad headline.   low outside, depends getting together. everybody clumping together one large mass people like crowd, different indoors. Remember virus persist 3 hours airborne. lot people given area that's lot viral load circulated across large number people. really matters vaccinated not, outside guarantee protection. survived first dose antihistamine, could theory get second?   guess learn lesson one way another vaccinations way future. Thanks! kind headlines fuels anti vaxxers.   said region, that's provincial reporting works. 620,000 people. know that's significantly smaller LA County, still think 400 far many. Toronto, population close 3 million, reported 23 cases recent reporting day.      vaccinated person catch unvaccinated person?

No.

Breakthrough infection rare, happen.

Infection requires exposure someone it. (Since whole fomites thing refuted.)

Because breakthrough infection rare, statistically less likely *exposed* COVID-19 group fully vaccinated people, there’s less chance person group carrying it.

If group unvaccinated people, higher risk *exposed* unvaccinated person statistically likely it.

So… partially right it’s safer around vaccinated people. you’re wrong saying unvaccinated people infect vaccinated people.

Basically every vaccinated person gets exposed SARS-CoV-2 virus “rolls dice” breakthrough infection.

By getting *exposed*, don’t roll dice.

Or another way looking it, takes two rolls get infected.

- Roll dice whether someone around exposed virus.

- Roll dice whether exposure give breakthrough infection

If you’re highly vaccinated community, first dice roll going fall favor much, much higher frequency. becomes rare even *exposed* virus.

If you’re around lot unvaccinated people often, much higher chance failing first dice roll, exposing second dice roll.

The often make second roll, risk becoming breakthrough case… but, odds still generally favorable, least variant.

Vaccination also makes odds favorable subsequent dice rolls come infected: spread others? go hospital? go ICU? negative outcome morbidity?

Data shows us vaccination makes dice rolls favorable odds, too.

But theory, there’s always going unlikely dice rolls. best follow CDC Guidelines manage risk best can.

And help encourage people get vaccinated, lowers risk.  Indeed post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Delta reported worse outcomes (more deadly) prior variants. 
  there's vaccines available there's two choices. ""worst strategy"" implies better one, no, ignoring realistic strategy point less deadly previous generation viruses. Also since asymptomatic transmission debunked ages ago, stay home self-Quarantine it.

The bad news comes Las Vegas, one top tourist destinations country, seeing rebound visitors. 2.9 million tourists came city May, nearly 12% increase prior month. 300,000 expected descend Las Vegas Fourth July holiday weekend, according Nevada Department Transportation.

“There’s lot people coming over,” said Michael Gardner, vice dean clinical affairs School Medicine University Nevada, Las Vegas. “Some visitors bringing things.”

Nevada coping convergence factors. state low vaccination rate fewer half residents receiving least one dose. That’s coinciding return Las Vegas’s famous nightlife: casinos restaurants packed point it’s difficult even get reservation, many locals also enjoying fun. Masks rarely worn.

Resorts World, latest property open along Las Vegas Strip, said it’s “solidly booked” weekend average room rates seen even pandemic visitors flood city.

About 90% new patients greater Las Vegas area people weren’t vaccinated, according Cassius Lockett, director disease surveillance control Southern Nevada Health District. highly contagious delta variant also becoming prevalent, making almost quarter cases 2.2% May.

How effective COVID-19 vaccines Delta variant?

By Melissa HealyStaff Writer 
July 2, 2021 8:27 PT
Once distant threat, Delta variant coronavirus first identified India reached every corner United States — promises live name.

The Greek letter delta scientific shorthand “change.” It’s increasingly clear coronavirus strain bears name track shift pandemic’s trajectory.

The Delta variant estimated 60% transmissible next-most infectious strain — Alpha variant first detected United Kingdom. means spreads close twice readily original coronavirus

But vaccines limit havoc, 181 million Americans received least one dose. much protection help Delta variant? explore.

Will COVID-19 vaccines protect Delta variant?

Yes, though slightly reduced level versions coronavirus. got vaccine requires two doses — U.S., means ones made Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna — need gotten shots waited two weeks reach full immunity.

A study based real-world data U.K. found two doses Pfizer vaccine 88% effective preventing COVID-19 result infection Delta variant. That’s notch 95% efficacy demonstrated clinical trials earlier, less transmissible strains.

However, who’ve single dose vaccines made either Pfizer AstraZeneca, effectiveness Delta variant 33%, U.K. researchers found. effectiveness one dose vaccines earlier strains 51%.

These results backed laboratory tests antibodies produced response two doses Pfizer vaccine. antibodies able neutralize Delta variant, 9.6-fold reduction efficacy. That’s likely translate modest reduction effectiveness, since vaccine mobilizes army “neutralizing” antibodies far larger needed stop slow replication virus human cells.

But got one dose Moderna vaccine. protect me?

Moderna said week vaccine — similar Pfizer shot — also highly effective Delta variant.

The company tested blood serum eight fully vaccinated individuals found 2.1-fold reduction efficiency people would fend infection Delta variant. Again, given legion antibodies induced vaccine, reduction little effect vaccine’s protection.

I got Johnson &amp; Johnson shot. protected Delta variant?

The jury still one.

In early June, researchers tested serum people vaccinated J&amp;J vaccine variety “variants concern,” found performance suffered little Beta, Gamma Epsilon variants first detected South Africa, Brazil California, respectively. Delta variant wasn’t included tests.

Johnson &amp; Johnson reporting lab study, serum eight people got company’s vaccine mounted strong immune response Delta variant. didn’t say strong, paper presenting results hasn’t posted yet.

The J&amp;J vaccine bears strong resemblance AstraZeneca vaccine, widely used United Kingdom tested Delta variant there. study, getting doses 60% effective reducing risk COVID-19 caused Delta.

Should still wearing mask protect Delta variant even I’m vaccinated?

Research conducted U.K. November 2020 mid-May 2021 found even face coverings social-distancing strictures place period didn’t stop Delta variant spreading time lightly vaccinated population. (However, measures almost certainly helped slow virus’ spread)

There things consider besides vaccination status. What’s vaccination rates community? long Delta variant area?

Once Delta crept in, won’t take long see whether begins crowd variants. Centers Disease Control Prevention keeps track is. also check state county health departments’ websites detailed information variants live. transmission place characterized “substantial” “high,” consider wearing mask even you’re vaccinated.

Your community’s level vaccination also matters. early May, Delta variant elbowed circulating variants picture quickly counties less 29% population fully vaccinated, according study. Delta competed strongly vaccination levels higher well, number U.S. counties currently showing even 40% 50% residents fully vaccinated, variant spread briskly.

I already COVID-19, natural immunity. help Delta variant?

Sometimes, Delta variant appears care you’ve got natural immunity. always.

A study Columbia University researchers estimated that, based India’s recent disastrous wave Delta-fueled infections, natural immunity protective “approximately half time.”

It’s still known, though, whether matters variant infected before, long ago it, robustly immune system responded first infection. Given uncertainties, you’re willing run 50% chance catching Delta variant, there’s one piece data throw mix: study U.K.'s Office National Statistics tracked 300,000 Britons tested positive infection variant virus. found that, 18 weeks out, almost 14% reported lingering symptoms.

If come COVID-19, know I’ve got Delta variant?

If you’ve infected recently U.S., there’s roughly one-in-four chance it’s Delta. That’s 25% coronavirus samples genetically sequenced days turn Delta variant, according CDC.

But things related COVID-19, varies widely state state even county county. Montana Dakotas, Utah Iowa Missouri, Delta variant thought responsible many 57% new coronavirus cases. CDC monitoring region made California, Nevada Arizona, it’s making way charts considered responsible 38% new cases. Meanwhile, mid-Atlantic New England Pacific Northwest, it’s getting started.

I dont think good correlation single-out medical doctors group spread likely occur, counter-arguments could also would need mandatory vaccinate say... partygoers?

I'm arguing vaccinations though, providing possible explanations, hoping maybe helps find understand little bit? :) Netherlands natural immunity factored in. tested positive past you’re considered fully vaccinated single dose instead two. I’m sure, think single dose risky two doses susceptible people, isn’t it? Anyway, AstraZeneca used anymore people 60, Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson) opt in. Everyone else gets Pfizer Moderna. We’ll see plays out. Evolution stems essentially random mutations. successful, thus likely thrive, others less various reasons.

If virus evolves chance deadly would tend less successful destroys method transmission environment, however depends incubation period: still long enough deadly may matter. quite short could reduce likliehood transmission all.

There method mutations though, happens happens. Take chances don't.  Honestly point let’s Darwinism it’s course unvaccinated people.

You’re taking vaccine concerns with, would rather take chances virus kills people get infected, leaves many hospital, leaves even awful symptoms last months. could averted taking vaccine don’t concerns about, yet reason don’t want to.  average every day person want think hard SCIENCE..follow herd, use critical thinking..we are, average, dumbed necessarily. that’s pattern 1918 flu followed, COVID necessarily follow path, primarily due long incubation period high number asymptomatic carriers. deadliness severity virus basically irrelevant successful is, since affect virus’ ability spread.

The evolutionary path virus going incentivizes higher transmissibility, resistance vaccines, evasion immune response, preference previously less-vulnerable populations. Unfortunately, mutations make virus transmittable able evade immune system also made deadly. Again, due long incubation period asymptomatic carriers, evolutionary disadvantage way 1918 flu. Right. understand, I'm ground. see patients everyday, I'm seeing large levels infectiousness right now. I'm Pasco, FL. confirmed P1 death elderly patient May. Since cut seeing variant data detail due lovely governor's order. He's sued news outlets, releases localized data papers court constantly badger it.

That said, counties *around* experiencing significant upticks infectiousness. county half innoculated. half comprised mostly geriatrics people 55-60. expect see ""spill-over"" infections neighboring counties soon.

Live Texas I’m fully vaxxed 2 months now(Moderna).

I plan going mall later today wondering wear mask, would good skipping it. know CDC says it’s generally fine point, due spread Delta variant said otherwise. 

It’d kind nice wear one year half (I work retail constantly wear one there, understandably so), don’t want personally irresponsible anything. trying imply I'm one ""parroting"", perhaps somehow failed notice I've never actually made statement requesting back claim.

I'm looking UK statistics right now, surprise... suggest anything even close implying. Smallpox natural too. That’s reason eradication unlikely. would assume would many common cold coronaviruses well. so, that’s pretty big safe effective.  Viruses mutate deadlier versions. successful variant needs contagious, biologically unrelated deadly is, would lead 50/50 chance whether gets less deadly (or could stay well). However, two social reasons deadlier variant usually less contagious.

First, deadlier variant likely noticed infected people around them, causing infected isolated contagious. Second, variant deadly, people alter actions government action, social distancing, isolation. Imagine variant became 90% deadly people would react compared now.

Unfortunately, factors mitigated specific case COVID. first factor, COVID often contagious symptoms appear, decouples deadliness noticeable contagious phase. second factor, 90% deadly variant would surely cause change actions, also burned deadliness could probably double triple people would willing take actions going back lockdowns. Short answer, they're screwed. 50% adults ages vaccinated delta variant spreading possibility hospitals need triage. 

It's quite unlikely UK hospitals allowed get full, even doubtful get full unless daily cases get ridiculously high, 300,000+ day high. vaccination vulnerable groups means likely end hospital orders magnitude less likely to. 

Daily hospital intake January 4,000 day, yesterday 304, doubling rate scary short government let daily cases get 300,000 cases day high, least really, really hope don't. nice. Variants keep getting stronger deadlier, that's changed mind. Also feeling guilty contributing spread, considering also wanna go back gym soon. feels like weird thing happy about. yay? think vaccine supply plentiful US many places possible. primary care doctor vaccine clinics fridays. Goddamn unvaccinated fire fighters. aren’t addressing mental aspect weight loss hardest part it. Immuno compromised exponential factors this, aids documented multiple mutations single host instances ( least one) guess almost chance schoolkids &lt; 15 vaccinated year. It’s possible small subset could get like 12-15 maybe.

My kids (10 8) last 3 semesters whole class classroom masks (Sweden). tested times cold symptoms, never positive. one either kids’ class tested positive period, despite massive community transmission. doubt next semester different, - schools fully open younger kids despite threat delta variant. 
Especially recent reports seem reporting smaller risks children initially feared (e.g new report found basically zero “long Covid” compared control group). Thanks last sentence. People always say calories calories aren’t psychological reasons cause people overeat lay bed. found keto subreddits toxic kept expressing diet triggering old eating disorder thoughts they’re like “calories calories out”. see... new side effects discovered full approval? stop approved? vaccinated person catch unvaccinated person? caught actually symptoms, vaccinated, could pass people now, too?

So unvaccinated people give unvaccinated people vaccinated people, vaccinated people generally can’t give vaccinated people, unvaccinated people considered extremely dangerous avoid around cost.

That would include taking full precautions under-vaccinated regions, i.e. stay home, wear mask, etc.

And yet… CDC saying this, they’re continuing say you’re vaccinated you’re safe.

These confusing times we’re living in. it’s changed enough. concern goes vaccines - variant changed enough vaccine less effective, may need vaccinate towards new variants (like flu year). help people want helped point. Need start making difficult people refusing get vaccinated fun shit (sporting events, concerts, etc.) feel incentivized get it. you’re comfortable one, wear one. don’t lecture vaccinated people made different choice. important thing got shots. don’t need squabbling mask. need additional safety showing EUA. eyes? get eyes? Wow must gotten one worst side effects. feeling relief, surprise, hopefulness Cloud9 comes Moderna. team Pfizer side effects hopefulness relief. Seriously. mom keeps asking visit husband get vaccinated follow mask/distancing guidelines outside businesses require them. Family exhausting. Wearing mask going make difference living dying already vaccinated, though? There's merit wearing regarding diseases can't knock entirely, CDC literally reiterated couple times ""yeah, hey guys fully vaxxed need anymore"". Personally fog glasses inconvenience. I'm fully vaccinated, need anymore. still idiot? needlessly push aggressive judgmental ideology. Good luck. They're ballpark, India 7x population Nigeria 27x population Kenya.

And GDP per Capita really issue here. can't find median household income Nigeria, comparing median income relevant we're talking many people approximate $2000 USD per year English speaking telemarketers get paid.

In short, still numbers game. entire population Africa hundred million less India, affluent countries sub Saharan Africa like Kenya Nigeria even smaller portion continent's population.

Africa course take coming decades population grows faster India especially China. yet, India huge.

Again, India's dominance telemarketing another major factor scam prominence telemarketing phone scams essentially skillset. Yes.

It took 9 weeks able get second shot, of... wait it... supply issues, second dose different vaccine first one. Pfizer too.. first shot sore arm.

Obviously that's baring fda approval I'm guessing move forward plans unless good insider info.

On top that, lot colleges want require getting fda approval done start back good goal.  vaccine have?

Covid gain immunity, therefore taking resources. virus may well eliminate point, thus nudging people make new replacement people virus could infect. Akin classic [trolley(bus) give ideas virus mutates randomly.

When new hosts easily available, mutations result higher rates replication shedding expense host's life well-being consequences, since virus infect hosts. So, vulnerable people available, especially close proximity, ""hot"" variant one prevalent population.

When, due widespread immunity public health practices, new hosts harder obtain, hot variant likely die host. Variants less detrimental host become prevalent.

There probably link infection rate illness, rapidly replicating variant use host's resources. cases, two characteristics linked. instance, variant may contagious survive longer air, dry surfaces.   sub doesn’t usually post studies. You’re lucky link something Google search results. Japan fellow laymen think correct. big difference vaccinated people spread less.

So actually replication level still positive vaccinated people, that's probably worst case scenario.

If enough vaccinated replication level negative, odds variant emerge beats vaccine goes less less people getting it. Unfortunately, good company. TVA truly oversees time, never heard now? deadly, less evolutionarily fit virus is, generally.

San Diego county low case counts per capita, chances particular people, ill-informed may be, would currently infected visit *very, very* small.

Any half decent survey would accounted that. presymptomatic spreading phase likely removes selective pressure deadly variant, unlike viruses Tennessee Valley Authority? Reddit moment. Put shut up.

Explain ""not even close"" true. exaggeration, concept essentially correct. Looks like might specific places like work, doesn’t apply them. worries. also shared experience many us would known about. 

All good :)  many past viruses, yeah case. one, sure. Long presymptomatic spread periods mean selective pressure deadly variant basically eliminated since infect people know sick. made joke another covid variant thread one noticed :( 32 yo well. expect people 30s fully vaccinated end July. I'm well aware many people vaccinated be, yes. protect infection (not perfectly high degree). addition get infected tend infected much shorter period much lower viral loads (and, virus significantly fewer rolls dice develop new mutations). They’re perfect (no vaccine is) good people sub enthusiastic happy talk stuff like this? people want enjoy bad news? can’t understand it. ethical dilemma. expect people ages take vaccine scientifically proven risky actual illness protects want protect society whole.  case wonder world could stretch limited supply mRNA vaccines making AZ-mRNA standard recommendation?

Has anybody tested Chinese vaccines followed mRNA? article found mention blood clots relating flu shot. find mention flu shot ever giving people blood clots. I'm curious, sure adenovirus vaccines carry risk? world can't live lockdown forever

This everybody saying 6 months ago Try telling unvaccinated person that. headache 15 minutes, perhaps there’s catchy name syndrome? clear I’m talking poor folks wish could vaccinated, cannot medical reasons.  That’s bad reading it. work critical care setting covid patients healthcare provider, yet vaccinated. could give 14 paragraph explanation why, would deleted quickly seen one. could go both. viruses, contagious showing symptoms, would mutate deadly, virus would either kill host infect people, people would react deadlier variant stay away symptomatic people.

 


The long presymptomatic period cov2 means people infect others know sick, removes selective pressure deadlier variant. study find hard number says mask-wearing reduces risk say American never wore mask social distanced 50% chance catching COVID now. Wearing mask would reduce chance 35% 50- 17.5% chance. Pretty big reduction risk. 

But vaccinated person, let’s say odds catching COVID onwards like 1%. Wearing mask would reduce odds 1% .35%. That’s still 65% reduction risk, since risk small begin it’s big change. 

My point vaccine protect mask ever will, wearing mask, me, seems redundant. report? Untrue virus still spread vaccinated vaccinated. engage risky behavior chance increases. So, sole intent avoid infection (not severe COVID) masking would still best chance source work pharmacy administering told us don’t get paid bill government patient insurance. aren’t 98%+ people “bad cold” symptoms Covid anyway? thought hospitalization rate less 2% people ""Tell understand infectious diseases without telling understand infectious diseases."" many times already pandemic. Scientists still researching whether vaccinated people produce enough virus infect people around them- evidence suggests viral load low. mutate vaccinated host, host can't transmit others, maybe matter? people already caught Covid?

I caught Covid last year symptoms. Wouldn’t strain less dangerous me? Yes, this. long presymptomatic period means selective pressure deadlier variants. pretty much likely get deadlier variant get less deadly one Well, disappointed. expecting 5G maybe personal voice mail delivered via telephone poles Bill Gates got band-aid left arm :P lot people risk hospitalised already fully vaccinated.

How borne reality since see delta variant less deadly? unvaccinated people seen ""disease factories"" vaccinated people still contract virus spread it? Presumably virus mutate body infects, vaccine no.

Most likely update tomorrow since 4th. Gotta careful making sound cool though don’t want give people ideas  It’s super unlikely virus become significantly deadlier, requires major virology thingies happen stuff stuff it’s hard. 

I expert, *is* bigly unlikely mutates something deadlier.

Yes, there’s danger ecological fallacy major health indicators really, really good ways get handle well given society deals health states overall healthcare. I'd worried kid's social development stunted COVID parent. People realise low risk them. Also Germany: good luck getting appointment anything Astrazeneca. Thanks explanation. appreciate it. work healthcare. One co-workers voluntarily received COVID vaccination, shortly experienced severe malaise point requested transported emergency room eval. subsequently left ER several thousand dollar bill, going entirely responsible for. co-worker waited workplace mandated vaccine condition employment, would strong case file worker's compensation claim. yet vaccinated myself, I'm absolutely rush say least. Purge sucks man. got covid stage vaccination process. vaccine, first Pfizer shot, second. Speaking anecdotally, covid symptoms became less severe time.  still gotten sense smell back. That's September. expect full approval then. Interesting headline says ""unvaccinated people 'variant factories' "" article says ""unvaccinated people potential 'variant factories' "" mean two completely different things. omg Enterprise. LOVED show. One worst things happen sudden end. sphere builders xindi, wanna go binge lmao I'll watch loki first cuz something seen.

It’s like need backpack carry around … kind dick stranger going give grief taking precautions? don’t know youre immune compromised not. Yeah, heard mention that, I'm sure. thought long-haul percentage 10%, Journal saying 10-30% seems high.

Long-haulers *are* one things bring people bitching *BuH pEoPlE dOnT wAnT wOrK!* I'm like: 600,000 1,000,000 people died. least 3,000,000 long covid, they're working, often family friends helping things, meaning family friends less likely pick extra shifts.

Not mention that, people dumped asses help, they: moved back home away jobs coming back; went back school learn something new coming back; found new job/new way living turns suits better coming back. decent number immigrants (legal not) moved back home able willing come back yet.

But sure, I'm sure extra $300 week entirely responsible labor shortage. *have* people understand can't work way college, can't live minimum wage, many young people still live parents. go overseas military vaccinate many different diseases. guess lot felt covid different. choice biggest risk getting severely ill getting covid, getting vaccine. there's still chance getting sick vaccines, medicine works.   got Pfizer arm super sore (I've heard arm circles helps feel like made worse lol) 6 hours later got fever flu like symptoms. people get bad symptoms pfizer. 

Congrats joining fully vaxxed gang! bother look doubt find legitimate, non anecdotal, proof this. However, known pets animals *can* infected covid, course spread it. There's little concrete information this, seems like could catch virus pet (and you). I'd imagine quite rare though. hard avoid contact pets mouth/breath, wash hands make contact. concerned catching pet much pet catching you.    chances spread outside low given people piled together. ability infected aerosols get transmitted lot good ventilation movement air is, packed outdoor parties really allow that. Damn spam filters  lot family there. None ever acknowledged COVID even exists... hyped AstraZeneca back early 2020... right punished failing take vaccine constitution. Period. Personally vaccine nothing compared actually covid. vaccine made feel like common flu symptoms (all passed within 24 hours). Mild fever, body aches, headache, etc,. Whereas covid chest pain one night (almost went hospital), headache, sense smell gone, overall weakness. covid oddest illness I’ve ever had. wasn’t like type respiratory illness I’ve through. 

With covid could tell *something* going lungs. wasn’t congestion, really bizarre feeling chest. felt type interference going lungs scary shit. could tell battle going there, body tearing lungs process. returned work, almost passed several times extremely diminished lung capacity. I’m 26 healthy still kind fucked up. don’t even get started horrible insomnia developed still struggle today 5 months covid. interesting heart disease deaths suspiciously increased peaks covid waves. leads suspect lot heart issues triggered covid infections. prove vaccine works using big enough double-blind trial. get trial big enough representative population higher risk exposed. give half vaccine, half placebo without telling nurse vial which. continue normals lives check make sure side effects see getting infected. wait long enough crunch numbers results. That's ethically test vaccine works proves not. large enough trial also shows statistically immune people day shot 1 2.  Yes. vaccinated people catch transmit virus, [they provide challenging evolutionary environment lead variants much virulent unvaccinated people original virus vaccine available.

That's one reason urgent everyone get vaccinated soon possible, increasingly virulent variants possible, quite likely pose much risk unvaccinated people. Sounds like one making unsubstantiated claims person mental health. Care comment said rather attack person? I'm pro-vaccine also pro-science science, slandering someone like writing tabloid.   would expect trend toward infectious less deadly, although nothing say can’t become deadly.  cares though?  Fine, use that. Commemorate somehow really matter. That’s usually July 4th lake. Covid sick nearly month, symptoms fairly mild. J&amp;J absolutely wrecked nearly two days. husband felt terrible Covid, side effects vaccine. 

I'm glad got one done, would gotten second dose needed to. Please spread mistruths vaccine side effects though. people strong reactions, told absolute terms nothing happen maybe possible little headache might scaring people getting second dose get really sick. there's got first trial participant... Ideally phase 1/2 trial basic safety demonstrated. problem “de-densifying” tends lead sprawl, awful environment. 

Privacy vs. security push back lot businesses things settle imagine, plus personally don’t care much privacy regards face seen public. enjoy privacy, there’s limit mind. can’t imagine going live music event doors six months year still seeing venue social distanced, masked, both. never uncomfortable crowds this, so, always, YMMV. Likely less deadly understand viral mutation. virus wants live spread better sneakier. novax probably saying “I don’t want give money big pharma”, actually getting vaccinated - variants constantly need rolling new vaccines etc. Surprise, uncle, get party!! really surprised? We're global pandemic ffs  roller coaster covid test results. Tuesday started feeling dry throat dry cough stuffy nose. Thursday got rapid test test, positive. Friday take PCR test, negative. Today took rapid antigen test PCR, waiting PCR, antigen said negative. cold negative right? muh freedoms  vaccinated individuals able asymptomatically transmit covid others?  think medical care withheld people antivax?  Mine are, MIL super overweight, lung issues relative die covid. trust vaccine angry us visiting.  thought robots, no?!&lt; Yeah, US never really got level containment keep virus able quickly regrow strength. also see countries able control buy time. think we'll need booster shots since current shots still good protection, hope update vaccines people getting first shot. US level density might sufficient expect social distancing, European cities dense taste. Dedensifying latter extent might bad. 

Reg. Masks, generally see net positive - privacy, reduces spread. advocating wearing masks public transportation, malls social distancing possible closed spaces. CDC : ""The Vaccinated stop wearing masks indoors""

The Unvaccinated: ""See CDC said masks required indoors!""

The number idiots I've come across misquoting CDC staggering.

...And course Governor TX, hell bent pushing policies make easier people get infected. FL TX round top 2 states highest daily case numbers. Sure they're lower list accounting population, also larger land mass, works argument, especially states higher population densities performing wayy better them. really good. Though loved two shows
 
I say better worse necessarily, same. time travel
 
It reminds hell lot star trek Enterprise, especially season 3, temporal cold War, real power behind bad guys controlling things different moment time, etc. Also use odd star trek term show, dunno that's thing comics whether writers show star trek fans trying drop Easter eggs 
 
It's good like sort stuff. would investigate. seemed help wife second Pfizer shot worked morning shot. sedentary shots felt pretty bad day after. 

I think staying active helps lot. Dammit, I’ll need edit edit.

Edited add I’ve edited edit. Again, there's difference trolly 4cham actual covid news subreddit. COVID-19 \*is\* likely become less deadly, contract early lives throughout lives, endemic human coronaviruses. actually case viruses tend become less deadly. There's certainly obvious pressure SARS-CoV-2 become so, fatality rate relatively low plenty time transmit host ceases become infectious. There's good summary subject did. :)

Didn’t know now, Reddit parlance, TIL how! flat false. know talking specifically, nowhere US past vaccination rate threshold would stop this.

That said, recent indicates vaccine 95% effective alpha variant 88% effective delta variant.

No vaccine 100% effective, reducing number hosts drastically reduces opportunity mutation fewer variants people vaccinated. Vaccinations demonstrably increase propogation variants. Prune variants.  otherwise, vaccinated people make new variants? unvaccinated people, nothing kills ordinary variants, vaccinated people ordinary variants killed, others survive.  Ugh. thought going original Loki meme. can't fix stupid.

Maybe COVID can. No, current mRna vaccines. actually zero real world evidence variant would. thank wanted know age groups given vaccine first I'm sure many states use covid funds this. person process needs qualifications one administering dose part quickest. School nurses easy answer that. multiple schools nurses flat school school registration day people already line pictures, paying fees etc. 

It's actually pretty low budget think it. facility vaccine already provided. extra step processes. reason? Medical reasons course make sense reason medical very, likely filled conspiracy theories  funny never said anything “muh freedoms” course wanted make strawman support ridiculously unrealistic idea requiring everyone wear masks social distance *permanently*

it’s amusing you’re trying hard condescending, trying hard make look like bad guy i’m favor permanent covid restrictions Yes, agree, exactly correct. asymptomatic transmission key feature enabling spread survival. people get vaccinated, many, still, understand even asymptomatic transmission... think 'not sick'... truly ignorant facts.    Probably either. understanding vaccines guarantee infected, rather reduce likelihood needing hospitalization. 

If that’s correct, vaccinated people also contributing “variant factories”? even technically true. probably spoiler, well. One hope. Low risk isn’t risk. heard Daniel Griffin go point TWiV.

That's according [Luc career scientist past prime way senile who's making fradulent claim fradulent claim tail-end career. frauds [Andrew [Didier Luc Montagnier free publicly spread bullshit research claims, surprising people get confused lose trust scientific claims... :/ one left vaccinate then.

FDA authorized  left ""because likely filled bullshit conspiracy theories"" Nothing different months. mean FDA approval use Emergency Use Authorization. Oh goddammit  strange.

It makes perfect sense realize people pushing alternative treatments grifters taking advantage mentally deficient.   vaccine prevent infection transmission. Actually coronavirus family exception exhibit RNA proofreading ability. Still, mechanism isn’t foolproof increasing infections unvaccinated people multiplies odds mutation slipping through.    correct, misspoke. Thank you, edited accordingly. mean, shit Sherlock... 

Give selection pressures, bam much higher likely hood covid mutate less deadly varient, viruses tend do, per science. fear porn reddit absurd. Look symptoms delta varient, hay fever/common cold. Yet everyone's conniptions. Maybe question even little cowering personal gulag till end days. seems weird. dissing nurse do? got vaccine approved. 

What people trial? people made it? What’s afew months going people 

No chance Covid ever going hit 0, even stats show unless people tested often forced quarantine positive well close contacts, vaccinated people going walking around spreading unknowingly 

You cannot force antivaxer shots cannot really rely well 

Could new jab protects guys show up? Possibly, anything possible would hold breath 

Again sucks guys left dust order return normal cannot anything anymore without risking chances “doing forever” Thank ""who first person nation receive FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine""

but FDA approved... really. vaccinated, get sick Covid means either exposed new variant antibodies don’t really fit, immune system didn’t respond adequately vaccination “learn” defend Covid. vast majority people vaccinated, immune response robust enough massively reduce viral replication, opportunity mutate happens. people get sick virus vaccination immune response poor, there’s real special selection pressure evade immune response. choice, now, stay masked indoor public/common areas. I’ve shots I’m worried myself. But, live apartment building several vulnerable residents. now, lot people still haven’t full vaccination, know several entirely unvaccinated, little protect fellow residents admittedly slim chance may transmissible others. That’s me; don’t judge fully vaccinated people choose stop wearing mask it’s sanctioned. agree we’ve waited long enough this. 

I wish, turn, people — city, — would stop giving hard time keeping mask on. was, is, always mainly protect people (self-protection lesser secondary). I’m annoy, reject judge others. weird! wonder see cases like vaccinated people. Like maybe body defeated virus day? confused. Seriously?! Gesch. satire

Please Nice vague answer. totally believe claims /s chat microbiologist: no

Edit: clear, yes things evolve survive. vaccinated people. risking health getting going get tinnitus rest life save 80 year old Carol.

Where get get tinnitus vaccine? exactly conspiracy bullshit original commentor talking nice clickbait title people yell “Everything called Covid Death!!” - data reveals lie. “stealing” deaths causes, causes would go Covid went up. Clearly case. I'm denying this, that's terrible, ""good""? already done? claim answers vaccines closest it.

Otherwise, suggest? Masks? Ok sure Covid still everyone wore masks year. thought vaccinated people could catch variants wouldn’t severe. Could still spread virus asymptomatic? Darwin approved message humans much hubris think control timeline viral epidemic. 


It's insanity.  may need parents permission Id argue eventually virus cull enough humans, deadlier version wont win regardless incubation period, feedback loop much longer say said considering people take booster shots 6 months? provide source. you?

Please  Really? one ""boomer"" obese person know covid. idiot people use word ""boomer"" children. Maybe get jizz-soaked futon, come ""boomer"" mom's musty ass basement go outside get fresh air oxygen-deprived brain, whatever farting ears giving bright ideas like reply. No. 

But limiting contact expecting ridicule using precautions benefit would start. percentage us stupid, news. love idiots tho pretty easy tell real experts. Take anti vaxxer Dr, Northrup, claims expertise via credentials obgyn, compare advice practice, especially stated books,to other's credential quickly see practice according principles credentials represent. bait switch - doctors basically defrauding patients &amp; insurance companies. like trusting stockbroker prestigious degree invest really throw darts Wall Street journal Typhoid Mary gang. Prune em!!!! still test safety. first one developed days, trials take months months. terrible strategy  I'm unbelievably frustrated people equating correlation causation.

Obviously variants propagate effectively. vaccinations, variants far likely emerge unvaccinated individuals. post that's 5 hours, ain't bad.  might trying still going happen pot comment clarify much much down. dont want people wrongly discouraged getting vaccine. someone else though. everyone else. people can't get vaccinated whatever reason. 

My father law got hospital treated already deadly disease. Luckily caught early okay. still, fact go even though everything right simply fair. social distanced, wore masks, stayed home, special occasions Zoom, missed Christmas, still go that.

Innocent people choice matter compromised die selfish people like you. everything right protect still people like get sick.

And speculative. 100% fault selfish people. directly responsible people dying refuse trust science. know. There's still difference. Many Americans think vaccine costs money. Many Americans primary care physicians. Many Americans lazy would get shot someone called scheduled appointment them. Double pfizered right here, got second shot yesterday, still limbs 6G connection. get jab, you’re smarter scientists. Like goddamn plague rats are. beaten 3 minutes. mASKs dOnt WoRk rofl antimaskers gonna say now? Haha same! Never mind virus risk. don’t want around kinds idiots! Sadly, work one. got mad found isn’t vaccinated I’ve working alongside doesn’t mask on. caring antivax liars gives attention want.  let die without attention, care you! meantime people compromised can't get vaccinated point continue take whatever precautions needed protect around them. vaccinated allowed resume lives, they're right now.

On recent Sunday night Le Bilboquet, see-and-be-seen restaurant Hamptons, well-heeled diners nibbled $475 tins Osetra caviar. handsome man showed gold Audemars Piguet watch sparkly female companion. party 10 polo shirts striped rompers danced tropical house remix Tina Turner’s “What’s Love Got It.”

They unmasked, waiters, bartenders servers kept mouths noses covered.

A similar scene unfolded Gucci store East Hampton, shoppers removed masks upon reading door sign stating vaccinated customers could enter without face coverings. Inside, attended store clerks blue-and-white surgical masks, per company policy.

In weeks since Centers Disease Control Prevention revised mask guidelines allow fully vaccinated people take masks indoor settings, stark divide emerged, particularly wealthier enclaves services premium.

Those still wearing masks tend members service class — store clerks, waiters, janitors, manicurists, security guards, receptionists, hair stylists drivers — without face coverings often well-to-do customers wined dined.

Employers hesitant discuss mask policies, sensible reasons requiring staffers keep masks on.

Just 50 percent people United States fully vaccinated. coronavirus variants, highly infectious may resistant vaccines, rise, said Dr. Lisa Maragakis, epidemiologist associate professor Johns Hopkins University.

Food servers, retail clerks, grocery cashiers public-facing workers interact day customers, put health (and health customers) risk. creates potential liability issues employers, also could hamstring business time worker shortages.

Even establishments give vaccinated employees choice take masks off, many keeping on. “Who knows shot hasn’t,” said Michelle Booker, store clerk Bronx works Verizon store Midtown Manhattan. wearing mask recent Tuesday, although company permits vaccinated employees go without masks. “I don’t believe half people come in,” said. “I’m still terrified.”

And public relations standpoint, seeing employees masks sends message management regards health customers staff. “Their workers serious professionals take safety seriously,” said Erin Vearncombe, professor University Toronto studies sociology dress codes.

The resulting class divide may always intentional, still jarring see masks emerged another symbol inequality pandemic.

At Apple store Midtown recent Friday, mask-free customers could seen buying $1,500 iPhones masked salespeople may make much week. nearby Sweetgreen, food workers black masks matching aprons, mostly people color, prepared $14 berry burrata salads largely white clientele.

“It sends message — one that’s internalized sides — body mask wearer ‘riskier’ body consumer,” Dr. Vearncombe said. “It shows certain groups have, even deserve, civil liberties others.”

Some workers argue mask double standard — one rule customers; another staff — discriminatory, defies logic.

“Customers vaccinated go maskless, can’t ask proof,” said Jose de la Rosa, 26, works behind counter Juice Generation store Times Square. “And workers fully vaccinated, prove still wear them. It’s odd.”

As Americans get vaccinated, establishments adopted single policy staff customers, allowing anyone fully vaccinated ditch mask.

A diverse array stores — including Louis Vuitton, Verizon, Dior, Target Home Depot — policy stores United States. Starbucks recently announced vaccinated workers would able remove masks starting July 5.

But now, mask divide remains many places. recent afternoon Hudson Yards, Mark Pasektsky, 49, public relations strategist, shopping shirts Theory store. clerks helping wore masks. not.

“It’s weird, right?” said. “On one level, can’t completely blame employers. comfortably institute policy protects everyone? can’t answer answer. psychology behind approach curious. making employees wear masks customers not?

It’s populace uninterested vaccine compliance. point, care much. vaccinated, wife has, 14 yr old has. 6 yr old overwhelming data kids 12 shows virtually risk compared flu, even less. fact, recent studies even show younger children infected even show little chance ""long covid"". much risk them. Sure, spread it, ones worry un-vaccinated adults ad fair vaccinate able. Mostly hate dealing yet another damn sniffle, cough, cold kids; one less better. 

At point, let thin ranks unwilling get vaccine. true immuno-compromised make small percent nothing new locking society going help them, either. Yes hospitals might get busy again. wife nurse Northern Nevada (where 61% 1st shot, better entire state 10% margin) deals Covid knows get busy point again, feels better protected hospitals prepared deal this.

We even trip planned Vegas 4 weeks Reno. may cancel trip cases go crazy, mostly complete asshole parent regards 6 year old. need expose Vegas levels adult lack control pandemic things get bad. sounds like much family, sad cause really can't anything, think know everything despise media stuff like this. UK media same, big breaking news articles claiming cases gone 300% bullshit, look like 50 people getting infected small town one week. Several boosters already trials months.

The likely update what's already produced would redo trials approvals that.

It's likely boosters would become main version used time goes on. wanted long covid disease, vaccines happy disproportionately affect downplayed dumb protect vaccination. 

I know immunocompromised people even vaccinated still risk, care, still engage behaviors protect i.e. going community church gatherings wearing KN-95 going out. 

Otherwise - waited entire year what's going play places like Texas (I live here). NextDoor epidemiologists virologists talking much less shit conservative town, maybe evidence ideas covid ""just flu"" vaccines ""aren't effective safe"" fucking Trump coming back president becoming insurmountable openly idiotic.

NY Times happened.

What happened? still speeds development stage. testing phase takes forever classical mRNA vaccines, still speeds whole cycle. Actually, is.   virus ever mutated something lethal virus' always mutate contagious? Asking friend.... Cases like exist extremely rare: wouldn’t explain 15 million people skipped booster shot. Thanks insult, you’re first one today! saying doesn’t change mind anything. No. problem involves one's antibodies attacking platelets. virus tries infect someone immunity ... may succeed ... replicate response pressure primed immune system. 

How virus infect someone replicate they've vaccinated?  

Are people beginning understand reasonable person **ever** take seriously again? medical literature support this. 15-25% 'only' matter, that's high percentage  Gonna need peer reviewed paper DOI back claim   clots usually appear within three weeks vaccination, good. holding onto fucking patents bullshit.

Unfortunately, news Portuguese find English. guess use translator Yeah. That's 3rd world country variants like Brazil, African, English India (or, politically correct, delta variant). unvaccinated people Europe / NUSA / Australia / Canada presented like biggest problem?

I'm young, I'm thin, exercise shape, fuck, I'm healthy, dont diseases immune system issues also. work ass too, walmart, customer decided cough give covid. never said anyone get vaccine, I'm one know got vaccine, I'm saying keep damn germs themselves, nasty ass people kept germs themselves, even need masks, let alone vaccines! Second wave 1918 Spanish flu would serve example: meaning super-virus movie-like quality (example talking ""ebola*-ish""* virus movie Outbreak)

This topic currently argued regarding delta delta plus variant virus thread named.

Importantly mutation random.

You could also site viruses move back forth multiple species hosts altering existing strains worse. number dice rolled becomes complex attributes shuffled multiplied transfers.

Again trend (a reasonably solid one) guarantee.

Any virus host tend try adapt spread (create copies/offspring). Yes efficient follow trend speaking of. However route get littered many dead hosts.

In regards conversion something akin common cold:

This kind biological drift takes time scales larger prepared wait.  outcome laying probable end game - may require decades random biological changes environmental / host second last paragraph article (although whole thing worthwhile read) sites OC43 virus also known Russian Flu.

**I'm generally board argument - think time scale likely foreshortened decade two.**  bright side, selective pressure favor deadlier variant, since killing host either irrelevant spread, actively hurts it.

Unless figures turn dead bodies virus factories. we're fucked. Many arguments ordinary people using N95 masks reserving limited supply would good: healthcare personnel risk. Particularly global shipping shut much workforce make idled. factories churning epic levels now, availability good.   That’s sad, preventable.    Moreover, almost definitely takes person vaccinated produce variant bypass vaccine’s protections. 

Citation needed. number armchair microbiologists thread way high.  I’m mobile can’t quite maths. think Wales ahead Flanders today might beat target.

It’s worth saying cases delta variant rising quickly Wales levels vaccination. extra nickname I'm loving show easter eggs. credits scene last episode made excited happens next. coworker run marathons this? can't imagine often not, need medication/a procedure affect people. Unvaccinated people get variant.

Vaccinated people effectively immunised alpha variant delta (or future) variants.

Vaccinations promote mutation. Delta variant lol..because asleep believe take responsibility actions, knowing outcome others.
